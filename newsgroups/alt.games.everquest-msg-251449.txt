There was REALLY bad lag in plane of storms during a flagging group the
other night. It was as if the whole group was slowed 500% and spells
had a 6 second delay, which made twisting next to impossible :P. Funny
thing was the mob we were fighting before this happened stopped
attacking... still took 10 min to take it down 50% though.
