Hey, I think it's a neat idea :) 
(I used to have a human monk on Drinal. I wanted to give her
Grasshopper as a last name. Since she's now been reborn as a DE mage,
I have to think up another last name, as well as one for my gnome mage
on EMarr. Fluffybunny would actually suit my gnome mage, since she's a
hippie treehugger (no, not going to steal it) : )
