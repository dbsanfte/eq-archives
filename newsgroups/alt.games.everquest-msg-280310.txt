The Time flag is fairly useless unless you actually plan on raiding Time. 
The backflagging, as currently implemented, means that raiders who want alts
Time-flagged will likely be raiding Time with their guild already, and as
such that is how they will get their alts flagged.  A raider who is past
Time, whose guild never raids Time anymore, won't have much reason or desire
to have an alt Time-flagged.

I think the change actually lessened the chances of the scenario you
postulate, at least with regards to Time itself.  I can see pickup raids on
Fennin Ro for Fire access happening as you describe, but that's about the
extent of it.
