CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
