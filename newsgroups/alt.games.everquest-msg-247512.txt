For the curious, the manual is available for download at coh.com, and there
is a quickstart guide there, so it's easy to check things out and get an
idea of what it is like (especially all the powers...and there are a lot of
them).

That won't really give a feel for what the zones are like, though.  Looking
at the map, I thought the place would feel kind of small, but it doesn't
feel like that at all.  It also feels way more alive than any other MMORPG
city I've seen, because there are plenty of civilians going about their
business.

Even if the game has no staying power...there is enough variety of powers,
and characters solo well (at least at low level), that I think it would be
worth the cost of the game and a month or two after the free month to just
play it as a single-player game that happens to have other players in it,
rather than as an MMORPG.
