That kind of kindness makes you feel good, had that happen to my necro
in netherbian lair to, got a 56 rez from a cleric just running by,
felt like a fool for not being able to offer her something other than
a sincere thank you.

Think many people in the game acts like you said, if they don't have
sow, breeze/clarity and a epic cleric following them they can't play,
and if they get into trouble run to zone and don't care who gets in
the way, and yes i don't like that whole run to zone mentality, many
times when i did that in younger years i died anyway, turning your
back on the mob you might as well paint a bullseye on you back, if it
is obvious that i will die i might as well stand and fight, maybe i
can get one mob down before dropping myself :)
