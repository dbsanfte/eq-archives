Err, let me see, 20 mins to get a sow then run to KC, then try to get a
rez., and retrieve my corpse. Running to KC with would not have helped,
since I got my corpse dragged, and a rez, by doing who all cleric. Running
with sow and trying to talk in tell is not my idea of fun. Ofcourse I could
have the CR and gone Ld and got aggroed, happened often enough, would rather
not risk it. And the only reason I waited was for a full exp rez, which was
my choice. I was pointing out to the newbies that CR runs are not as much
fun later on.

Err, sorry, did I say we had no mezzer. What I said was I went LD. What
happened after that I don't know, since my char was active and I couldnt get
back for 15 mins. But obviously they ran to zone instead of standing and
keeping me alive. Sux I know. I got a member of the group to pull my corpse
because I new he would feel a responsibility to help me. By then he was in
another group.

Err, what? I am in KC. Just how do I get to RM and kill 2 giants in 5
minutes. The time getting to RM then finding a group or healer partner to
kill giants would not be worth it. I killed several giants in FM but they
did not drop 25pp a time, so there is no guarantee, that in 5 minutes I
could make the cash back. RM is great but for the high level casters kiting
all the mobs. IMO there are not enough giants to go round. Bit like the
mamas in EF. Only hunt there when no-one else is.

Duh well obviously, but how do you know when you join a group what they will
do. I like to group with people I know but that is not always an option.

Good advice, I'll try that. BTW I was pointing out to the newbie that just
running everywhere is not that much fun.

Your right about that, but only a handful in my guild are high enough to
fight in KC, and often only 2 or 3 are there with me, if any. In fact we do
not even have a 56 rezzer.
Maybe I need a new guild, hmm.
