    Bet it was Asky. He's our pulling master and a great strategist.

    When you look at our strategies for doing things, you can really tell
that we learn stuff ourselves. For example, our Cursed strategy (to the best
of our knowledge) is unique across all servers. Contrast this with Wraith:
last night they attempted Cursed for the first time, using the exact
strategy that was posted on The Safehouse. He ate them alive - they lost
something like 40 people in in the first minute. So now what do they do? Try
the same strategy, which they clearly don't understand, again? Try to modify
that strategy, when you're not really sure why it works in the first place?

    One thing I know they won't do - keep on trying him until they get him
right, even though the loot-bearing forms of Glyphed and Exiled aren't up.
They'll wait for the gravy to be there before giving it another shot. Again,
a strong contrast to us - we've done more than a few Runed/Banished in our
time, and right now when learning the Emperor we usually go through the
no-loot Blood. Some of the old-timers in the guild even speak proudly of
dying to Sontalak 8 times in two days before finally getting him dead.

    James
