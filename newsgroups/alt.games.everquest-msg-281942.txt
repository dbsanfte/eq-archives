Beginning with PoP, SOE tried very hard to make raiding compulsory.   Have
they backed off that stance then?

Granted I stopped playing after OoW was out, so it's possible the last two
expansions have changed tha game... but I do believe that is the first time
I've ever heard anyone call Everquest casual friendly with a straight face.

Easy was a common complaint... but never casual friendly.   Even if you don't
count raiding, gameplay in EQ is extremely frustrating unless you can play for
large blocks of continuous time.   If you were not willing to do four or five
hour play sessions, it wasn't really worth bothering.

*shrug*  Perhaps the last two expansions have changed that, but it's still
hard for me to imagine.
