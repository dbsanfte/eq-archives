Cite please.  In my circle, most dislike it.  The ones that like it tend to
be in the under-20, instant gratification crowd that loves the first-person
shooters.

No...Downtime was not excessive.  It was all part of the risk/investment
(time)/reward cycle, which concept seems to have been lost on so many of

Warner/YSA/Etc. is frowned upon, too many people have lost sight of this.
Instant Gratification is a huge curse on this game and out society.
