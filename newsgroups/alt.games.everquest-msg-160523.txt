One point into each and every skill that you gain and that will go up with
use - no more no less.

Then as levels go by if a skill is falling behind put a few points in to
accelerate it....sense heading is useful if you are a newbie and dont know
the zones, for alts its less important. Bind Wound for a warrior is kinda
handy to boost its utility early on. Maybe some points into a weapon skill
you dont use much....

Decide what if any tradeskills you want to do and use them as a sink for
the rest.
