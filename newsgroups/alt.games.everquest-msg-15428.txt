I love my level 21 Bard.  Lots of times I will get in groups
with people 10 levels higher than me because I can
consistently twist 3 songs and if in the right environment
4.  The there is always the mana thing that stacks with
breeze/clarity.

It can be tough to play a Bard well, but not as hard as
people make out i don't think.  Like I said I twist 3 songs
and Mele and can even Mega taunt stuff of the casters if
needed.

Being the first to die in a group puts people off some I
think.  But that is fine.  I don't want an over supply of
Bards.  Verant would surely Nerf the hell out of the class
then.   After all Verant wants us all to be Dr00dz
eventually, and all kinds of people turning to the Bard
class would interfere with the master plan  ;-).
