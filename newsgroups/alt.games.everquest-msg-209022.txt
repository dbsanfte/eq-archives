What I'm saying is my belief is each merchant has X buying price for
item A. X is modified by charisma and faction. They also have Y
selling price for item A, which is totally and completely unaffected
by or unrelated to X (But it also modified by charisma and faction).
People keep talking about some kind of value range being the reason
some items sell back for much more than what the merchants buy them
for. What I'm saying as that buy price and sell price are two
separate, single values, not a range of values.

How exactly does that not make sense? Merchants buy for price X +/- a
% of X based on both faction and charisma. They sell for Y +/- a %
based on faction and charisma. X has nothing to do with Y.
