First where not to go.
Some say Lguk,checked it out,only good if you
like green caster adds and level 65 farmers. :)

Only spot so far I found to solo at 54 is the plateau
in the mid of Scarlet Desert,Sun Revenants are 
all blue to me,I read they stay blue up to 57.
They are pretty hard I found out,one of them is capable
to bring my not too shabby equipped Pally(3k hps,1100AC,
31% haste) down to 30% health.
They are undead ,but flee.
If you have problems you can escape them by jumping
down from the plateau,though it hurts a little.  :)
Very unconvenient place,if you ask me,next soulbinder
is in Shadowheaven or Shar Val.Bring a Sow potion and
some invis potions for the trip. 

Next thing on my list to test are the skellies in The Grey
at the shard camp,although I would be careful there,because
very close to them is a nasty ground trap,which spawns 
some stone thingies,which summon even when you did
no damage to them.
Dont beleive all these rumours about negative xp modifier
in The Grey,my 55 Druid makes 2 blues in 1 hour there,root-
dotting,its not that bad compared to Ldon,PoJ or PoI,xp 
comes painfully slow in the fifties in general.
Oh,and bring an enduring breath item.

That all said,I never solo with my Pally,only checking those
places out of curiosity,if I find no Ldon group in 15m or so,
I log an other char and I have plenty.  :)
My advice,if you have not much time,would be start some
alts,much more rewarding to level low to mid level chars,than
crawling through AAs in the 50ties.
