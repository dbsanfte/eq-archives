personally I dont agree with Twinking (probably because my highest character
is only 15). But only a brain dead moron would cause that much hassle over
something that a large number of players feel is acceptable.

My SK has two peices of armour I was given by a 50 odd level character,
everything else I have got myself. I still wouldn't give up the two peices
of flayed skin I have, and poke anyone in the eye who accused me of cheating
because I have them.
