    No, I'm basing it off a group taking 45 minutes to blow through the
normal type of their choice (usually collection or slaughter) and 15 minutes
to get your shit together. Was grouped with myself, a shaman, and four chain
types (RNG/ROG) on the weekend, two of the chain types weren't from a big
guild, and we were dropping adventures of that type in 20 to 25 minutes.
Assuming a less geared group would take twice the time is pretty generous.

    Qvic armour (the big gear-up armour for modern raiders, sorta like the
elemental of GoD) is quested. You hand the generic arms, gloves etc. to the
NPC of your class on the boat in Abysmal to get it converted to your class,
then combine it with an infused item of the appropriate armour type (silk,
plate, etc.) The infusion agent is sold by a vendor on the boat, a female
gnome in red plate armour, and costs 10500 pp. It takes one agent for arms,
bracers, helms, gloves, and boots, and two agents for leggings and
breastplates. Our guild bank, which had millions of plat in it during PoP,
is down to 10-20% of peak PoP value - we use the bank to pay for this. We
used to use the bank to buy top-end Bazaar gear to fill holes on recruits
until they could get a raid drops, but we simply cannot afford that now with
Qvic armour and reagent costs (peridots, pearls, emeralds, essence emeralds
mostly, very few coffins if any). We're quite lucky that GoD included a
tradeskilled recipe for mana batteries, as we also go through those pretty
fast (invis devices for non-invis classes, shrink devices for shrinking on
raids).

    There's also individual costs. The big progressive quest in GoD is the
Breakdown in Communications quest. One of the steps requires items to be
smithed that cost about 9000 pp off vendors. The big quest in PoP, the Aid
Grimel earring, required someone to be 220+ skill in Baking, Brewing, Jewel
Crafting, Fletching, Tailoring, Pottery, and Smithing. Skilling all those up
takes tens of thousands of plat, much of which cannot be recovered selling
the skill path products.

    My original point, mind you, was you can use cash to buy stuff you'd
use. You can save up for ornate, or a gemmed weapon, or even big-ticket
stuff like monk AoW pants or a Blade of Carnage. We don't get that sort of
cash, not any more - we're lucky to stay at breakeven for a month. OoW looks
like it might have some cash for us, as spells look to be on the PoP model
(and PoP spells made us a lot of cash), but given that all the zones are
supposed to be open access with only raid areas being flag-only we might not
have the advantage there that we had in PoP. We'll see.

    Most raiders that are rich are rich because of things they do during
non-raid hours, like killing big cash mobs (dragons etc.) with small groups
or farming tradeskill components in flag-only areas. We have a large number
of people in our guild that couldn't even make one of those Qvic armour
pieces on their own because they don't do those things.

    You should, as AA's are the best increase in power a non-raider can get.
Lemme look at what our "minimum required AA's" are for a SK to join us....

Arch - ND3, CA3, CS3, FR3, SCF3 (60)
Class - PE, Fearless, Super HT (17)
PoP - PP5, PD3 (19)
PoP Ab - LR5, ID5, Unholy Touch3 (42)

    So 138 total. You'd prolly be able to junk Fearless and FR3, since we
require that for Time-specific reasons, but that's still 120 AA's worth of
core goodness (126 with your General points). Now lemme see what our SK's
say on their private forums about AA's....

  They seem to be leaning towards making the melee DPS AA's mandatory as
well. Can't really argue against that. They also recommend strongly MC 3 and
Run 5, and depending on weapon used the soul abrasion line and/or weapon
affinity. That's prolly pushing towards 200 AA's, even before low DPS
increases like DoT crits or fun like Unholy Steed.

    Why would I care about AA's? This is the list of "do this" AA's I'd list
for a cleric (non-raid):

    6 points in General (including RS 3), Channeling 3, SCM 3, SCR 3, MC 3,
CA 3, ND 3, HA 3, HG 3, Celestial Regen, Divine Res, Reinforcement Mastery,
PP 5, IE 5, AHA 3, AHG 3, DA 3, LR 5, RC 3, the two levels of Swift Journey,
and Subtlety 3. That's pushing 200 as is. If I added on the raid-specific
stuff (MGB, BDA, etc.) I'd be at 400 to 500 AA's.

    They are looking at retuning these so people do them. But I imagine it's
pretty low priority.

    Then you wait for people to have the cash to buy Bazaar junk. I'm more
of the "go get it now" school of thought, but I could see why you'd have
trouble getting people there.
