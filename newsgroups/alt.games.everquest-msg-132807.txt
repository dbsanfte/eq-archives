Heh, my dad was USMC, I've heard him voice much the same opinion. :)

Actually, now that you mention it, I thinkthat was a fundamental part of 
his technique. :)

"Dad, how does this camera work?"

(Dad gets a big, cheezy, I'm about to completely pull your leg grin...)
"Well, there's a tiny demon in thee who can paint -reeeally- fast..."

"Dad! Come on! Really."

"What?  What makes you think that's not how?  Would I lie to you?"

"Yes.  Besides, there's no such things as demons."

"Oh, right.  A tiny robot then."

"No, you're still grinning."

"Well, ok smartguy, how do -you- think it works?"

"Well... if it was a robot, why wouldn't it come out all spotty like a 
printer does?"

...

And eventually, I'd be understanding things about 'focus' and 'emulsion', 
and then mom would come home and want to know why we tore apart her 
camera...

}> Don't underestimate kids, man, they're smart.  Really scary smart.
}But they lack the tools necessary to do that on a broad scale.

Pbbbt.  I don't buy it.

}Liberal education requires a broad base of knowledge as a foundation.

No reason not to get started on that foundation -immediately-.  Every 
single weird little thing you teach them broadens that foundation.  And 
it's probably already broader than you think. 

}That's why we teach algebra before calculus (although I think algebra 
}should be taught in fourth grade, at the latest).

Definitely.  I had algebra in 3rd grade, it seemed pretty bloody obvious.  
Professor E. McSquared's Calculus Primer was only a year or two later.  
That was a bit tough, and it didn't get to the really interesting parts of 
calculus, but it worked.  Apparenty, there was a Volume II that I never 
managed to locate.  And I've used that book with 5 year olds.  They 
handled it pretty well, and really liked the smartalecky duck. :)

trying to institutionalize innumeracy?
