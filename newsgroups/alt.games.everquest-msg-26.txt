From EQCaster's list, I see the following spells:

Cleric 39 Turning of the Unnatural
Druid 39 Group Superior Camo
Enchanter 39 Wandering Mind
Mage 39 Summon Shard of the Core
Necro 39 Chilling Embrace
Shaman 39 Tumultuous Strength

Also Shaman 19: growth

Not one of which has, to my knowledge,
ever dropped off of a guardian wurm.

The three hybrid 39 spells are storebought,
although I have seen them drop off the wurms
as well.  The Bard gets a 34 song, and no 39 or
44 one.

Thus, I conclude that my original guess was
correct: the 39 spells do -not- drop
at the guardian wurms in GD after all!
