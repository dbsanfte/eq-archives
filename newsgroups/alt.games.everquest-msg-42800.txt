I totall agree.  I twinked my warrior a little ( uh, a lot ) and was in the
commons doing some soloing and some grouping.  When I moved to W. Commons
for the Dervs, bears, spiders, I couldn't find a group that had an average
IQ over 40 for the Dervs.  So, I decided to solo a few levels.

I could take down blues one after another ( staying at 1/2 life after
bandaging ).  If I saw a Druid or Shaman or even a cleric in the ring and
they didn't look busy I would send them a tell "Excuse me, if you aren't too
busy and have the time, would you mind letting me donate for some buffs,
please?"  I also carried all of the Symbol regeants and offered them to
clerics in exchange for the buff, along with some plat.

Most of them buffed me up, and wouldn't take a donation, even if I insisted.
Others, I would give 2-5 plat ( plus the stones if a cleric ).  Only -once-
did I run into someone that was not amiable, or at least indifferent.  It
was a level 60 Shaman - I asked them nicely and offered a few plat, and
their response was "Sooooooory, that's nothing."  And that was it.  I
normally didn't bother the real high level people, but this gal had been
sitting there on her butt, begging for a port for 15 minutes, so unless she
was in heated discussions in tell or Guild chat, she didn't seem that busy.

They knew I was a twink by my armor and weapons, and knew I could afford it,
yet, most of them didn't take the donation because they appreciated the fact
that -they- were appreciated.

I moved on to Oasis after that to work on skills on the crocs.  I mainly
soloed, except for a few hours duoing with a druid where she "made
incredible exp", in her words.  I didn't feel right working on piercing that
was at 30 or 40 or something when someone was in a group with me.  My
problem was that I was leveling way too fast and couldn't get my skills up.
He's now level 19 and bashing with a Black Enameled Mace, trying to get that
1HB up.  The 2HB is going to be a trick, since I think it's about 13.  I
picked up a Mithril Staff for 200pp, but the damage is a little high for my
level and the delay is too high for working on skills.  I'm going to go grab
a shovel per Ben Haddock and Snafu's recommendation.

Ok, got a little off-topic there.
