You may find it easier to keep an Everquest journal in a spiral
notebook.  That's what I do, logging the date and any special things
that happen.  Including quests and persons who were especiallly
helpful - or rarely, jerky.
I list all the quest armor on 1-2 pages and go a-hunting :).  That
makes it more fun when you know just what you need.

Plus, if you do a quest like the Shadow Haven faction quest, after the
1st time, you can just run through it, as you have all the notes.  It
takes almost no time at all, even though the last time may have been
months ago.

Julie.
