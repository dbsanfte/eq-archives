Mobs run faster chasing you than they do fleeing you.  You can close
with a same-speed mob at the same slow rate it can close with you.
I learned this when dealing with green agro mobs that would flee at
around 40% health (goblins and orcs).  It is possible, if the mob
doesn't warp away or path into water, to catch it and (hopefully)
stun it with a bash from behind, or at least hit it and get it under
20% so it starts to slow down.

They run at same speed as PCs, which means marginally faster than a
fleeing mob (assuming it is a "standard" speed mob).
