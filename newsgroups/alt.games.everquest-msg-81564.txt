In a camp like necro or gang, its very easy to make several k within a few
hours, just on 'sellable' gems.

Very few clerics share the gems after they have covered their own costs.. at
the end of they day they hold all the gems, and they do have costs to
cover.. which is why people don't always press the issue.  Qute frankly most
of us are used to it.

Your also at their mercy when it comes to them splitting all the cash.. all
you can do is trust them and hope for the best
