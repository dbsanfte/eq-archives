last night on the Vaz server, no one could cast any spells. I was in Velks
with a group.
almost lost it on a slight over pull. But tanks were able to whip spider ass
with out cleric and enchanter (me).
Did any other servers experience this. Had never seen this happen before.
Who else is from Vaz server and where were you?
