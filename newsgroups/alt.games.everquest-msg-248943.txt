Exactly. :)

Actually I think all of my characters will eventually get one or more of
those skills.   Which ones will likely be coordinated with other group
players so that either we all get the same boost, or all get different
ones so we have em all.
Personally I think i'd most be concerned with accuracy, since missed
shots by definition do zero damage and leave you in the fight longer so
you take more damage.

I would love to be able to have a character that never missed, even it
didn't do huge damage with every shot.  
Hmm I could call him Khadaji (wonder how many people would get the
reference.)
