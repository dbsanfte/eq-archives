If I understand it correctly (couldn't verify it myself, as my custom UI's 
were all borked from the update) the price is shown in the item listing 
without having to right-click on the item. If that's the case, then I agree 
that, for spells specifically, level would be much more helpful. When I hit 
a new spell level (which will evidently be most every level now), I make 
sure I have plenty of plat to buy them and then sift through all the spell 
vendors looking for those that are of my level. Listing the level would 
make that process much simpler and less time consuming, the listing the 
names certainly helps as well.

Of course practically every other item would be better served by listing 
the price. I'm ok with the way it is. It *is* an improvement, and it's not 
like we've lost any functionality or anything.
