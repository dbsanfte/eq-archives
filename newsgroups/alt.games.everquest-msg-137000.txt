    My CH messages are in our cleric channel and groupsay when I'm CH chain,
so group members (who will also be part of the chain) can follow it easier.
But yeah, there's a ton of useless spam. The necromancers actually used to
have group messages for when they cast Mind Wrack, "Just so they wouldn't
both cast at once." They were in the basement. Just two of them, and one
mob. Turning on "PC spells" apparently was too much in that situation.

    Sadly, my old buddy is on Zebuxowhatever. I'll never remember how to
spell that. =( And if you want to spam, tonight is your chance - we do
Emperor tonight.
