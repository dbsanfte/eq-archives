Actually, I need to apologize for some misinformation, because apparently
in this last patch the situation with shaman poison/disease spells was
adjusted.  

Pure Blood cured fewer counters than DAura, but was faster casting and
less mana...choose your preference there I suppose. :)

What has ended up happening is that Shamans got their D.Aura back to
normal, they can no longer use Pure Blood, AND (this is the good part)
they get a group version of the cure poison/disease spell, instead of Pure
Blood.  Hence they still have a "niche" in the market of curing
poison/disease (which they had before everyone else got pure blood).

Some shaman prefered the new faster-casting Pure Blood which they can no
longer cast, but on the whole...the group cure is going to have advantages
I imagine. :)

So yes, Verant was stinky, but they managed to turn around and apply some
air freshener.
