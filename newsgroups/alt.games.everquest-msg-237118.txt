Have you done enough LDoN hard to draw a comparison?  I'm trying to convince
my regular crew of people that we should make an attempt at the Sewers, but
they won't because we can't quite beat an LDoN hard.  LDoN hard doesn't
completely wipe us, but we haven't been able to beat the timer yet.  Our
Pally tank is light on hp's at around 6500 fully buffed, but the cleric has
good gear and FT14.  From what I've read, single pulling in the Sewers is a
lot easier than LDoN hard, meaning that even if the MT goes down we probably
only have the one mob to wrestle with.
