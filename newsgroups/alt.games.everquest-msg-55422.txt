All well and fine, but of course your statements that you cannot play
because of computer problems came later - after your initial posts.

You know, things like where you jumped on Ray:

"You didn't read what I said. What I said was that all the events that
have occured throughout the life of EQ have gone on when I can't play
or are zones away and can't get there. I also know they are widely
varying lvls which is why I like to keep chars of all lvls in case an
extended event occurs like they use to have for about a month or so on
Karana with undead invasion in qeynos hills. And so far on ayonae ro,
they have been gm events. I haven't seen or heard of the old
"invasion" events going on. Please stick to what is being said and
don't assume you can read between the lines."
