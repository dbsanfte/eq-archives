Unless I'm wrong (and I'm never wrong, says Prince Humperdink) the list goes from Least
populous down to Most populous, which resides at the bottom.

Look at the position of the Zek servers, for example, always up on top of the list.  Think they
are most popular?

Perhaps Karana has a relatively high population of Euro's during the US daytime, and while the
US population rises, perhaps increasing the total Karana population, the same tide raises other
servers as well, while the lateness in UK time means a sizable portion of your player base is
logging off.   The same general phenomenum happens with Morel Thule; we have a substantial Euro
population (and an Asian one) that keeps logs out in the (US) evenings... then again, MT is
always somewhere up towards the top of the list, which is what caused me to pick it in the
first place.

If I'm wrong this means I deliberately picked one of the most crowded servers while thinking I
was picking one of the least crowded.
