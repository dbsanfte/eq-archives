I made net profits of nearly 100kpp with my bazaar trader on Tunare by
buying low and selling high.  This was over a period of a few months.
I would leave him up while doing stuff around the house and just sit
down every once in a while to see what was for sale in the search tool
and over the public channels.  I limited myself mostly to tank gear,
as I had a good idea of how useful it was and the whole purpose of the
exercise was to upgrade Kaev's gear.  Of course, I've abandoned Kaev
now, so it all seems kinda pointless.
