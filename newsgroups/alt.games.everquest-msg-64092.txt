Well, there are a few glitches (ok, a *lot*), but the
new stuff is GREAT so far.

I *love* the new dwarf model.  I'm no longer
the Pillsbury Dough Boy, I'm a short, stocky, muscular
humanoid with actual arms and legs.  Very sexy.  :-)

New armor textures -- wonderful.  Dwarf armor used
to look like potato sacks, very drab and nondescript.
Now, even Armor of Ro and Deepwater Armor is highly
detailed and looks like it was actually made by a
skilled craftsman.

Note:  New model characters, when naked, are NAKED!
Woo hoo!  And, if I may say so, the Woof Elf female has a
spectacular ass.

/pickface -- design your own face, from a huge
number of hair styles, hair colors, facial features,
eye colors, and for the dwarves, beard style and
beard color.  Ultra cool.

New emote animations:  Stunning.  Just stunning.
Also, when casting spells, your character now
does a "chant" facial animation, opening his mouth,
and you can actually see his tongue, and the flashing
of his white teeth -- not just the incisors in front,
but the whole row of molars.

Skeletons in general -- vastly improved, since
they rely on the improved Necro pet model.  And
they're hilarious when they run, like they're
boogieing or something.

Framerate in oldworld zones is faster and smoother, thanks
to the new hidden surface removal algorithms.  Nice.

Luclin zones -- BUY MORE MEMORY.  With my 128MB,
inside of buildings is choppy, out in an open plaza is
so bad (thanks to disk chugging) that it's hard to even
type a message.  If you have less than a boatload of
memory right now, load *only* the new character models
that you truly need to.

Lots of bizarre graphics and mouse bugs, but frankly
WHO CARES??  I know they'll be fixed soon, but the
improvements are just great.  I'm happy.
