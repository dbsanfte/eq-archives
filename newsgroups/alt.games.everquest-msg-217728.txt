Would you find it acceptable if they did it the way DAoC does?  In DAoC, you
can find vendors and other NPCs by going up to guards and asking them where
the NPC is, and if the guard knows (which generally is equivalent to the NPC
being in the same quarter or so of the city), the guard points toward the
NPC.

No immersiveness problem there...but annoying if the NPC has a name that is
hard to type.
