<snip James' CHeal mitigation idea, you read his post, right?>

It is unfortunate that the creativity of the current designers

seems to be rather limited.  Your idea, for example, scales so
nicely that it could be retro-fitted into a number of current
encounters (EXTRA! EXTRA! Old Mobs Learn New Trick!) and thereby
achieve the effect they're seeking with the mod rod nerf without
delivering the coup de grace to Manaburn.  But it'd no doubt be
too much work to implement it.  Combine that with some sort of
compensatory ability for Monks to prevent their AC nerf from so
severely handicapping their pulling ability vs. fast mobs and
their survivability in a "train from hell" situation, while
dumping or scaling way back the mod rod nerf, and VI might
could get what they claim to want without so many negative
side-effects.
