I use the macros the pause command is in front but the spell will cast first
then the pause
/pause 80, /cast 1
this will cast spell 1 with an 8 second pause from the start of casting. To
figure out your pause you will need to take in account the time to cast and
the recovery time before going to the next command line.
/target sonso
/sit off
/pause 80, /cast 1
/pause 120, /cast 2  (always give yourself a longer pause or the mod will
agro when you sit)
/sit
