Same thing with my shadowknight, only it's his Dragoon Dirk that doesn't
fit any more. And my bard carries around an Enchanted Seafarer's Dirk for
a little extra dex/agi which *used* to fit in his range slot, but doesn't
any more. Note that not only have the range slot labels been removed, but
they no longer have a throwing range listed either.

I reported it as a bug last weekend but haven't heard back from them. Maybe
they got too many complaints from people who accidently threw their 200pp
range items...
