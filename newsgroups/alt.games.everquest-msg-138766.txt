W2K with an SB Audigy card here, I seem to be one of the few that haven't
had any issues at all. The Giant Patch didn't cause any hiccups, and
surpisingly it didn't even set sounds back to default settings or anything.
I leave music off all the time and it didn't turn itself back on or anything
(I had some graphics settings default).

Anyone noticed how nice (comparatively) the background noises are in Jagged
Pine Forest are?
