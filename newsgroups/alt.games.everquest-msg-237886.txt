This is posted at the Everquest home page:

Sony Online Entertainment has exciting news for all EverQuest players. As
the world of Norrath evolves and expands, so too does the technology
powering EverQuest. Sony Online Entertainment is making significant upgrades
to the EverQuest engine which will allow SOE to provide players with the
great game, but on a much more stable and efficient platform. SOE
anticipates patching in the new engine sometime during the next month or
two.

According to other info on the site, it should be sometime this month.

ALSO, under the Server Status page, they show Test as being down, yet I can
still log onto it!

SO HERE IS MY QUESTION, if there is going to be a new graphics engine, why
is no one talking about it here or on any EQ web page, why are there no
screenshots, and why is it not up on the test server yet if it is going to
go live on the regular servers this month???
