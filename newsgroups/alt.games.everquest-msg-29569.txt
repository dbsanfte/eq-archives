Hell, no.  I could easily play EQ for 14 hours a day but I don't *let* 
myself play that long.  And I'm single :p  But if I was an alcoholic, 
whose fault is that, the alcohol's or mine?  I don't see any bottles of 
beer forcing themselves on me.  Nor is there an orc centurion standing 
behind me and smacking me everytime I turn off EQ.
