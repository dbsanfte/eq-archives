I thought this too at first. Then I realized that some people may not 
actually be looking for what you're trying to sell at a great price. If you 
throw out a WTS with a price, you might get someone's attention.

That said, I still don't understand why anyone would spam it without 
including a price. That's just rude. If I'm going to have to look you up 
just to see that I don't like the price, I shouldn't have to wade through 
your spam.
