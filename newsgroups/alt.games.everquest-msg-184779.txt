    Our cap is 200. Given he was just gaining it as a byproduct of being
hit, that looks about right. I've noticed with damage shields that offense
has to be close to cap before you start gaining defense at a good rate, so
that would also explain the relatively low DEF.

    At 47 he went to CoD and grouped with the necromancer main (65).

    I bet he nuked to pull, too, hoping to get the 1 damage that way.

    No, the fastest way was what was done: him grouped with one other
character, a soloing necromancer. Hasted, we've clocked charmed necro pets
in CoD as high as 575 DPS. If the necromancer knows what he's doing it's
fairly safe, and if Carprin is down or blown you can go to town on the high
level but very low HP caster undead in the back. The fastest numbers I've
heard is 15 minutes per AA for a solo necromancer. Given a guild necromancer
and myself were doing 40 minute AA's last night, and we didn't go to the
back because Carprin was up, I believe it.
