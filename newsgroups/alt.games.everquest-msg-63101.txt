Driver Update Info -

Depends on the OS I guess but I assume you have Windows 95+...

Just right click on my computer, go to properties, then hardware (I think
thats it not for sure I am using XP now and its changed)

It should give you a list of everthing.

Voodoo went ouf of business so I don't know how you can get new drivers...

You just have to go to the devlopers web-site (ohh say if you have a Sound
card from Creative Labs you would go to www.creativelabs.com/ or whatever
their web-site is) and look under support or drivers or something similar.
Select your card (or whatever you are updating) and download the latest
version...

Good web-sites eh not sure...take a look around google.com, search for
Windows Basics/Computer Basics or something...

Buy a book for your OS...its pretty simple just tinker around with the
stuff. If you mess something up and all hell breaks lose you can always
reinstall Windows, it should fix most problems.

(Yes I do assume you use Windows because you said you have a PC for games,
and most games run under Windows or Linux...and Windows is the only OS I
know sorry if you are using somethig else)
