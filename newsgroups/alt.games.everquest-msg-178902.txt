A Tale That Wasn't Right
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice

Thanx to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight

Chorus
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain

It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight

Chorus

With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry you bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again

Chorus
