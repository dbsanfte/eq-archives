No, you really do start over.  We did it sometimes 3 times, getting better
choices in race and class each time.  Yah, most people are glad to just make
it to 60, (we called it Hero Level), but for the ones who want to do it
again, they got rewarded.  Seems like there was a higher exp necessary for
each level also.  Can't remember now that I've moved on to one of these
high-falutin moving picture games.  If anyone is interested, search Muds on
the net or there used to be a program called Zmud, I think that was good.
