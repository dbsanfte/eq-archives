We can but speculate.

 My brother works for Sony, and has seen (not involved with) the new Star
Wars Galaxies in trial mode. You can see the similarities between EQ and SWG
in the way the game runs, but the way the program runs has been completely
re-written. My guess with EQ2 is that all the current stuff will be
available, with a new graphics engine along the lines of the SWG one. Same
as the Jedi Knight series of games. Lastest version has new graphics engine,
so it is a separate game, and not a add-on.(it uses the quake engine IIRC).

No zoning with SWG either, so if EQ2 is using the same graphics engine some
safe areas may need to be implemented to allow the EQ tactics to remain (ie
High Pass wouldnt be the same without the ability to zone to kith).

Same as the Jedi Knight series of games. Lastest version has new graphics
engine, so it is a separate game, and not a add-on.

I would also speculate that you will be able to carry characters over to EQ2
and that that wouldn't be difficult, seeing as the server litterally holds a
data file with your information on it.

We'll find out (not)soon enough.
