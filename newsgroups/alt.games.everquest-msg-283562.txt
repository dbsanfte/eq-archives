Akanon: Steamfont, well lit, lots of lowbie mobs and only a short run 
thru LFay from GFay.
Kelethin: In GFay, decently lit, lots of lowbie mobs, right next to 
Crushbone and Butcherblock
Kaladim: Butcherblock, well lit, lots of lowbie mobs, right next door to 
GFay, and to the boat to Freeport.
Felwithe: Just outside GFay.

Freeport: NRo, EC, near Oasis and WC and Nektulous.  All of the above 
have a good progression of mobs in a variety of level ranges, but might 
be subject to getting "camped out"
Neriak: Nektulous is dark, but that doesn't matter too much to a DE, 
near Lavastorm and EC.
Rivervale.  Misty Thicket, and Kithicor by day.  Well lit, good array of 
mobs, lots of protection, but a long ways from anywhere, either having 
to cut thru Kithicor to WC or Highpass, or run the long long gauntlet 
thru Runnyeye/Gorge/EKaranas etc.
Ogguk: Dark and tree filled Feerrot, next to dark and irritatingly 
flooded Innothule, or scary RM, and a long ways to anywhere.
Grobb: Innothule is at least an improvement on Feerrot, but its still a 
pain, exits thru SRo or Feerrot, also near UGuk
Qeynos: Well lit, excellent newbie yard, aqueducts, near QH for higher 
level hunting, and from there Surefall Glade or Blackburrow, or exits on 
WK.  Also has dock to Erud Island and on to Erudin.
Surefall Glade: well lit, exits to Jaggedpine and QH, fewer mobs than 
Qeynos though.
Hallas: Excellent well lit newbie area in Everfrost, although a bit of a 
maze before the map era.  Access to Permafrost and to Blackburrow, 
although the latter is a pain due to night blindness and a long long 
tunnel in the dark.

Erudin: Access via boat to Erud Isle and Qeynos, the Tox is a dark and 
irritating place for the nightblind, although less so than it once was. 
  Also access to Kerra Ridge and Paineel.
Paineel: Has own Newbie Garden, fantastic hunting for lowest levels, in 
a well lit secluded area, well stocked.  Next to the Hole, which is 
crazy high level for starting out, but also to Warrens, which is good 
indoor hunting in a high ZEM zone.  Thru Warrens to Stonebrunt.  And of 
course next to the Tox, and it seems to not be a problem moving thru 
Erudin to get to the docks, regardless of which Heretic beliefs you may 
hold.

Possibly the frogloks will be in as well, with their tent city in Rathe 
Mountains.  Decent hunting, well lit, but again, travel problems getting 
anywhere beyond that, with the whole "feerrot" thing to one direction, 
and LRathe/SK/NK/WK etc. a long run to the next city.

Conclusions: The various Faydwer cities, Qeynos, and Paineel, get high 
marks, Hallas and Freeport less so, Neriak (and possibly whatever 
theFrogs call their town) behind them, and Ogguk and the Grobb dead last.
