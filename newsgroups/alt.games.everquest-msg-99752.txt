Well, something that came to my mind was you can level from 61-70, but the
benefits of such leveling only apply while you are in the PoP. 61+ spells
could only be cast there and HP and AC drop to what they would be when you
were 60th. For all intents and purposes when you are not in PoP you are
60th, when you are there you can use all those groovy cool spells and
abilities.

That way the entire game as we know it now would still be balanced and they
would only have to worry about balancing the PoP environment.
