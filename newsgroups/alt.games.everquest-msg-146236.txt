ok, I have not played my 52 cleric in MONTHS, and logged back on with
him last night and joined up with a guildie in DSP (that's the 48
warrior)
we had some fun, but there were a lot of dumb asses training the
tribal's and the shrooms.
Any ideas/recommendations on where this pair could go to do some
decent exp... loot is not a concern, (we would love to pickup acryllia
but it is not a must).  Oh, and were not adverse to picking up people
in the area we are hunting in, so it is not a LOCKED duo... 8 )


Your time is appreciate, as usual
