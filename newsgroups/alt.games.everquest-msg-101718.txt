Heh we will just have to agree to disagree.

I never saw it as a competition. perhaps that's why I never went past
35 nor cared about raids. If you see this game as a competition then
you might be one of those folks that play the game for 8 plus hours,
if you are so be it. Being married with a farm and other
responsibilities I don't feel the need to compete with anyone.

You can also note that I have not in any of my msgs called you or
anyone Idiot or moron (wonder why one would have to resort to name
calling) which I found amusing.

Have fun enjoy your gam... competition.
