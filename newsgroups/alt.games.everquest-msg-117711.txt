45?!  Even pre-AA fix that's pretty high.

I can only assume you're throwing in items (and pretty high end items
at that) here.  Off the top of my head I can think of Aura of Battle
(2 per tick), Fungal Regrowth (15 per tick), Frostreaver's Blessing
(10 per tick, with *major* Monk stacking issues).

Iksar regen is 6 per tick standing, yeah?  The first tier AA regen
maxed adds 3 per tick (well now it does anyway) and if you can stomach
losing 12 more points you can double that with Natural Healing 3.

Adding all that up (assuming you've spent 15 AA points on regen only
remember) it comes to 37 assuming you have 10th Ring, Fungi Tunic, an
Aura of Battle item AND can get it all to stack properly with losing
something else (our Monks tell me the 10th ring f**s up their Epic
effect or something..)

Rangers can use ALL those items and obtain the same AA skills so
basically it comes down to regen WE can add via spells (15 per tick)
versus whatever bonus regen YOU get racially which you pay a hefty xp
penalty for anyway (0 bonus or penalty for Human Monks natch.)
