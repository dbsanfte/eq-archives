Thanks, this is great info. Just how to I read it, though? What I mean
to say is, how do I find out what kind of faction value certain mobs
have? I've never seen any kind of information like that before and
would love to see something dealing with it. I've recently started
playing an Iksar and would like to work faction up in a couple of
places, so this information would be invaluable to me.

Thanks
