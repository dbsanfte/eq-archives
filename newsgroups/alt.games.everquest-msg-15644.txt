Generally you will have to fund your smithing upto about master yourself,
that should be a coupple of hundred plat if I understand, after that the
best way to go about smithing on a budget is to make and sell banded armour
on demand, or possibly making studs for tailoring however that is very
irritating. With alll the twinks nowadays though selling banded armour is
relatively hard but with a bit of work you should be able to make it to fine
plate which is where the money is.

As far as can be told having the books has no use other than to check
recepies so unless you don't like spoilers or are on the bleeding edge of
the skill they have no practical use.
