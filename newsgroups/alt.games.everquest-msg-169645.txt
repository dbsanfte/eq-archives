> No more camping Pyzjn for me! =)

Some time ago I was playing my then 16th level Necro in Qeynos Hills.  I
want to the undead ruins to try out some undead spells and was promtly
killed by this nasty caster.  I had my shaman, then around level 22, nearby
and I decided to log her and avenge the death of my poor little necro.  I
went to the site, killed Pyzjn, looted her and went on my way.  A few days
later I went to sell some misc. loot and started to sell off what I thought
was a just a piece of Malachite.  I took a look at it first (thank God!) and
saw the +9 INT.  OMG!

I told a friend about it and he filled me in on what I had.  To date it's
the luckiest thing that's ever happened to me in the game.
