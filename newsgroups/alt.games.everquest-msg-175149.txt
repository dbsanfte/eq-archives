Dying a slow death?

3 new Euro servers (including Venril Sathir) opened up for US server ppl to
transfer to on Monday.

The deal was, for a 1 week period, you can move to the new euro server with
all gear and pp, completly free of charge.

The deal was good for the first 1000 people to the UK, French and German
server.

Venril Sathir received its maximum 1000people in a DAY.  Its full, closed..
theres still room on the other 2 though.

So at least 1 of the 3 is VERY much alive.. expect to see a HUGE influx of
new high level people very soon on your server.

And stay away from mysupersales - its "illegal", and the dumb fuck uses
spammers to advertise his wares.
