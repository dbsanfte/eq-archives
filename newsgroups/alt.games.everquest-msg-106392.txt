The new Generation of players won't have anything to whine about.


OK who's complaning, cuz I wish they would shut up.  Things are fine the way
they are.  Everyone started with their first new character and had to work
them up.  Part of the privelege of gaining higher levels is the ability to
twink new characters and bypass much of the drudgery of low level playing.
One of these days I'm gonna be high enough level to "twink" and with all the
complaining I'm going to miss out!
