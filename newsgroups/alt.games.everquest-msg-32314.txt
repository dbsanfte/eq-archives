Just out of curiosity, how is it 10 times better or in what
ways do you see it as 10 times better? I am not talking about 
touchy feely ways or ways you don't actually quantify when I say that
or ways you don't like the politics of Microsoft but I'm talking the
real honest to goodness ways in which it is TEN times better than IE.
I'm asking because I was using both side by side and found mozilla to
be none faster and not work quite as well on the pages I visit a lot.
I could not even say that the one I prefer is twice as good as the
other though, so I'm just wondering how you quantify "ten times."
