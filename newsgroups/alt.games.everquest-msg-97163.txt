"what Is NeverSleep?
We can Log Your Character in, and effectively play your character
during those inconvenient hours that you are unable to. e.g. Sleep,
Work, etc."

Throw account security to the wind! Trust punk kids! Break the Eula!
Gamble!


"is this Some Kind Of Scam?
No. It is, in fact a legitimate site."

I BELIEVE YOU! I mean, if you were scamming someone you'd
come right out and say it! "Why yes, I am scamming you!"


"Why Aren't Credit Cards Accepted?
Simple, Really. While we can always be certain about OUR end of any
given transaction, No E-Vendor can EVER be 100% certain about the
Client's end. We at NeverSleep prefer to avoid the entire issue, never
allowing even the chance for E-Fraud to occur by avoiding E-Commerce."

1) Because we are not a legitimate business and so fly by night we
can't even get a simple merchant account at a bank  and a software
system to process credit cards. Evidently we've never heard of paypal
either.

2) Your credit card company is set up to deal with fraud, in serious,
scary ways that make little boys wet themselves. Credit cards and
money order and such are meanwhile cash.


"Is That Legal?
According to the EverQuest EULA, this is not specifically forbidden.
Though since they reserve the right to Change said EULA at any time
with no notice, A more proper Answer would be "Yes. Until they say
differently""

1) No, because the EULA says you can't share accounts.
Therefore this is forbidden by the EULA at the most base level.

2) Duh.

3) We want your money but flunked 3rd grade reading comprehension. 


This has already been done. I think the site was Uber U and may be
gone now.

"iii. contains unlawful material, including but not limited to

vi. Is used predominately for commercial purposes and such use has not

Bingo, goodbye. This is kind of the problem with a free domain name..
you just figure the site you got it from is www.n3.net. You should
really read this stuff before starting your "business" venture.
