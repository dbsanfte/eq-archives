Let me get this straight, now you're defending feudalism??????????

Now I understand, you must really hate and despise "artists".  You're
telling us (in your earlier post) that "artists" should be required to
live as beggars, dependant on donations for their livelyhood.  And
here you're explicitly objecting to an organization that seeks to
guarantee that livelyhood by selling copies of the artists' works.

They're also useful to the artists you wish to turn into beggars.  They
may be greedy, and often cross the line from symbiosis to parasitism,
but they do indeed serve their clients far better than your donations
ever would.

You are seeking to dictate, and I for one much prefer the messy
competitive collabaration we have in place now to any imaginable
dictator.
