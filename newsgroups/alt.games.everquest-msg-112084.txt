I've been invited to a Faydedar raid, and I found it hard to refuse (I've 
gone from never having raided, to raiding several times a week... and I 
like it, except for the being a zombie during the day thing). How much 
hunting will I have to do in Mistmoore to restore my faction to its 
previous level? I really enjoy not being KOS to Gorenaire and her 
siblings... 

Thanks.
