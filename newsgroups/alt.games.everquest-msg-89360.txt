Hi all just a quick question for ya.  Well just had my main char ding level
46 at which point I have really outgrown alot of my old hunting grounds. And
unfortunatly I am in a guild that does not do much hunting together due to
too many lvl differences so my question is I am a necro and have really
started to enjoy grouping more then soloing so where is a good place for
pick up groups? I have tried Lguk but it seems that has become a bring your
own group dungeon and it seems in DL I am still a not very desired class to
add to a group. Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
