Ok, you've said this enough that you might actually believe it.  I strongly
disagree, especially in the context of the rules laid out by Verant.  You swap
two letters, the words are now mispelled.  People can still easily figure out
what the original words were supposed to be.  That's a clear cut violation
since the original words would have spelled Bigole Titties, which Verant would
not have allowed (I HOPE we can agree on *that* anyway).

(Woohoo, in 50 years I can do a search on "John" "everquest" and "Bigole
Titties" at google.com and proudly tell my grandkids, "I wrote that!")

I don't think it's a different issue at all.  If it violates the spirit of the
rules, especially in such an obvious manner, I hope Verant would still take
action.

Someone stated that Tigole's last name has already been changed (maybe even
long ago), which makes me feel better about Verant anyway.

It's in the EULA that they can basically do whatever they want for any reason.
So that makes it relevant.  It wouldn't stand up in court for everything (like
if they decided formatting your hard drive was the new "reward" for waking the
sleeper), but it's fair warning to users that they shouldn't try to get by on
technicalities.

I thought something to this affect was in the EULA itself, specifically
regarding names?  *shrug*  Maybe a cop out, but again it lets them deal with
wise asses that try to get them on a detail.

No, it doesn't.  It's impossible to list every little thing the users could do
to violate the rules.

I didn't agree with the banning of Mystere.  That was an out-of-game incident
as far as I was concerned, and should have ended with a cease and desist
order.  Verant *can* ban whoever they want (and I support that right), but as
they showed here, it doesn't mean they should.  This was a very unusual case
though, and not at all typical.  They used bad judgement.

Again, it's impossible to put everything that might be bannable in the EULA.
If they tried, even fewer people would read it because it would require its
own CD.  For most cases involving banning, they should issue a warning or
suspension first.  If its a widespread problem, stick it in the EULA and call
attention to it.  But they can't go updating it every time some joker does
something wrong that wasn't previously itemized.
