Absolutely no question?

People tend to overlook most of the help male characters get when they
make this comparison.  I tend to think it's because whenever a male
character receives a gift, gets buffed, whatever, no one thinks "it's
because he's a guy."  When a female character receives something from
a stranger, it's *always* "because she's a girl."  That tends to skew
someone's empirical observations.

The scientist in me says that while my female characters may have
received more "help" ingame than my male characters, it's probably not
statistically significant.
