Hey, ya don't know till you try. I'd have felt quite the fool if I'd
passed on going to wisp isle at the earliest opportunity. Plus,
collecting information to share for the group from direct experience
rather than "he said, she said" is always a good thing. I'm still
forever feeling in debt for the "level, stamina, swim skill vs. time to
drowning" experiments conducted for this group's benefit.
