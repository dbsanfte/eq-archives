I'd be more inclined to suspect the latter, unfortunately. I was soloing
the entry mages in Najena at 20. Managing CC in dungeons as a mage takes
a lot of work.

At 24, the 2 entry mages are green/teal. The 2 in the crystal room are
teal/blue.  The goblin magicians downstairs are blue. The ones in Trazdon's
room we haven't conned lately, but are probably white/blue/yellow to us
now. We haven't even tried getting to the ones by the jail. My guess is
that you'd be restricted to fighting the ones in the bottom of najena, but
you'd still be getting xp for them. On the other hand, if there were any
other PC mages in najena doing the green mages for *their* focus drops,
they might well let you have any extras.

The big advantage of najena mages over the feerrott gators would be the
fact that they're static spawns with a short respawn timer -- about 15
minutes. You're likely to be able to hit 2 or 3 groups of mages and med
up by the time the first set has respawned. Also, don't forget the mages
drop the torn pages of air/earth/fire/water you'll need for epic anyway.
