So I'm collecting a full set of Fireman gear drops off Ragefire;
the look is fun and I love the Fire Resists for certain mobs, but
its certainly not anything I wear every day.  Still, its
something to do.

Killed Rage again today for a guildmate, and drops were 2
breastplates and a bracer.  Well I already have the BP, but
bracer was there.  Got in a small bidding war with a guildmate
over it, ended up blowing 9 points on the silly thing... but what
are points for, here's an item I actually want instead of just
something that drops that I decide would be an upgrade.  What
does it matter its really useless?

I forget the stats on the bracer (you can see how much I cared)
but it has a clicky on it.  Well the other clicky's are useless
so far, hat has a low grade AE nuke thats not worth my time, BP
has a AE blind... can't imagine how thats useful, especially
since I have targetable blind thats very cheap and fast.  Anyway,
the clicky on the bracer is Fire Bolt.  51 damage max bolt spell.

Much to my surprise, this is coming in very handy.  I don't care
about the damage (51 damage per 4 seconds? very pitiful even if
no resists at all) but the range is much better than any spell I
have, and there's a delay between cast finish and effect,
particularly at range.  Excellent for pulling purposes!

Well now I feel bad for outbidding that warrior... on the other
hand he has about 4 times my total points and could certainly
have had the thing if he'd valued it that highly.  And I don't
feel all that bad, because I do pull a lot, solo or in small
groups; I know its a Rainman sort of "slow in the driveway"
thing, but it adds to the range of what I can contribute, and to
the fun of playing a class normally thought of as so single
function.
