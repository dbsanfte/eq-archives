Sadly that bug has been fixed. Even when it was in place it wasnt that
simple - with WA5 and multiple combat effects items I'd proc pets like
no tommorow, and it required more than merely concurrent procs. Still, I'd
get a permanent timespinner pet maybe once every 2-3 days, and on one 
memorable occasion had 2 of them up at once, pretty much soloing the ldon
adventure I was on at the time while my group just watched in disbelief.

They were pretty mean once given a full mage summoned pet gear kit and
buffs ;)
