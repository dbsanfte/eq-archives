When I was xp'ing in paludal, I'd always leave the sullied weapons. 
Just not worth it cluttering up my inventory.  They are only worth a few 
silvers.  Now the armor drops I'd always grab.
I don't understand why people don't loot money at least.  I always need 
money.  Even a twink alt needs money.  Can't drop money on the ground 
anymore so you gotta trust someone or have 2 accounts in order to give a 
twink money from your high level character.
