    It, like all weapons that are in use, goes in either primary or
secondary slot. So does a 1HB, which is your other choice for the slot.
Keeping H2H capped so, if you someday get an awesome H2H weapon, you can use
it at full efficiency is good. Paying 1000 pp for a H2H weapon with worse
damage output than an equivalent cost 1HB is not wise - get something dirt
cheap like a PSU, use that to gain the skill, then put it away and pull out
the superior damage output 1HB.

    By mid-30's your fist is doing the same damage offhand as the PSU. If
you have the weight to spare and 50 pp, going with a PSU is good. But paying
1 K pp for a training weapon which gets bagged after the skill caps for the
level is silly!
