Yep, your analysis proves the fact that dial-up modems
are killing online game performance.
EQ is designed to tolerate quite large ping delays,
while Quake 3 is just  playable, though I won't win.

So what is the next best alternative for the online gamer?
I am using ISDN flatrate connection,
and experienced a substantial lower
ping in Q3 when using Fritz Card ISDN instead of a 
dial-up modem. The delay may be caused by the modem
data conversion and then passing data to the serial port,
from where the CPU actively has to collect them.

DSL should be still faster in ping response, as you pointed out,
have not had the opportunity to try.
would ADSL perform  better, ping-wise than ISDN?
ADSL download rate is 256kB, but the upload rate is only 64kB.

Methinks, the data rate as such  is not the main point,
its the network response rather.
Scratching my head about your suggestions...
happy hunting,
