That would be great if they did something like that.  The sheer tedium of 
levelling in tradeskills seriously sucks, particularly in one where you 
have to make extremely large numbers of precombines which give ever 
decreasing xp as you level towards the next tier.  It's not as bad for my 
provisioner, as he is generally making things that I actually need most 
of the time during the levelling process.
