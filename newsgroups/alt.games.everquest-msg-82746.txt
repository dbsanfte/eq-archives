I remember one stupid barbarian that did this..... I wandered into
BlackBurrow one day to hunt some gnolls.... Saw a HEAVILY twinked Barbarian
Warrior with blinking armor, big swords etc..... of 5 seasons. He didn't
know the zone too well, and of course he fell into the tree. (For those who
don't know, the tree has a loose bottom which makes you fall down all the
way deep into the dungeons of blackburrow). He of course died within
seconds, and came back from Halas a few minutes later.... offering 20pp for
the one that went down and get his corpse out.

Now it was a Sunday morning in Europe when this happened, most of the US
were asleep, and only 3 persons (ncluding me) were in the entire zone,  -
none of them above lvl 7. After 10 minutes he offered 50pp, and very soon
this went up to 200pp. A few minutes before eternal decay he offered 500pp
for the one who would get his corpse out (with 10k+ worth of stuff), and at
that moment a lvl 15 barbarian that was traveling through the zone to get to
Halas offered to go down and get it. He found the corpse and dragged it back
up.... and while the 500pp transaction was made..... *floop* the corpse
decayed in front of our eyes. The level 15 barbarian was man enough to
return the 500pp, but the corpse was forever lost.....

Big lesson: *NEVER* twink below level 6. Level 6 is easy to reach without
any twinks You don't need twinks. Just twink after that.....

There is a *very* sound reason why NOBODY EVER gets to know my EQ password.
No way!.

I agree. I think this has to be due to human error of some sorts. Its not
impossible that you loose equipment due to bugs, but this usually happens
when a patch was made, and they are usually traceable, and happen in large
numbers. And usually these bugs are about 1 item only, not all items. Its
almost certain you died, and are below level 5.
