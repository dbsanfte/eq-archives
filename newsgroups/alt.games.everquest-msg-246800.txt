}no no no Sorry about implying it was your word. I didn't come here until 
}too late. I was responding to your post so I referred to it here as 
}coming from you. I didn't pay attention to you using someone elses(1) 
}word too. See... footnotes would be SO helpful. :) My 9th grade English 
}teacher was right. :)
}(1) I can never remember if that warrants an apostrophe or not. If it 
}does consider it in there, but gobbled up by the bit-monkeys in 
}transmission. If it's not supposed to be there then good. I left it out 
}on purpose.

You're saying the word belongs to someone else, so you would use the 
posessive case, "someone else's", in order to be compatible with the 
English 2004.5 standard.  Most English browsers will interpret the phrase 
correctly with or without the apostrophe, however. :)
