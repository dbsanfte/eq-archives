Melees are just fine at math. The bottom line is that we don't care
how much mana the Shaman has. Once we get our buffs, you can leave the
group for all we care. You're just sucking up or exp, anyways.

It always cracks me up as a Warrior that when I ask "mana?", the Mage
or Druid or Shaman comes back "20m". I wans't asking you...I don't
care what your mana is. I was asking the Cleric. His (or hers) is the
only ones mana I'm interested in. I mean the _mage_ answering!?! Come
on. You guys don't do anything anyways. Why would I care how much mana
you have?

Yeah, Shaman and Druids to have some healing capability, but other
than a few "overlapping" levels, they just don't compare to a Cleric.
When I'm out there getting smacked around by two or three mobs, the
pathetic healing abilies of a Shaman just can't keep up.

Just gimme your buffs, then sit down and shut up.

The Cleric is the one I listen to. The one whose mana matters. When
the Cleric say "oom", I say "Calming down, master."

So, for you casters out there, when the tank asks "mana?", remember,
we're not asking you. We're asking our Cleric. Our cuddly, snuggly
little Cleric.
