Oh, come on, Ed, haven't you figured it out yet?  Water's wet, Sky is blue,
and I'll be bitching about Paladins being underpowered.

In all honesty, I think Paladins are just a touch under where we need to be.
A few more tweaks, and they should have it right.  A snare undead would help
quite a bit (and be perfectly acceptable from a role-playing standpoint.
Call it Bonds of Nife, or something like that).  Along with the Brell's
line, maybe another Pally only buff would be nice, but not required.  The
group heals are a great idea, maybe make them a tad more efficient.

Now, it's the warriors who I seriously think SoE hates.  They aren't better
enough than the knights to justify them in anything but the most HP
intensive raids.  They seriously need some balance there (and a fix to the
AC system, and removal of the soft-cap).

And I still want long hair for my half-elf.
