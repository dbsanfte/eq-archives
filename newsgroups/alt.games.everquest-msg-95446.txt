What we did recently was gather a bunch of newbie halflings to the arena in
Freeport.  We gave them all bows (so obviously they should pick a class that
can use it <g> ) and 20 arrows each.  The idea is simple...last halfling
standing wins.

The twist:  Add a higher level ogre warrior with an attitude.

The newbies are in the arena plinking each other.  The ogre is in the arena
running around just minding his own business, ignoring the stupid little
halflings around him...

...Until one of them hits him by accident.

If that happens, he gets 2 free shots at the newbie (we used summoned arrows
for all).

If you last through those initial 20 arrows and need more, you can get
them...but they're going to cost you.  You have to /shout something rather
demeaning like, "I'm sorry for being a stupid little halfing, Mr. Ogre, may
I please have more arrows?"

Ummm, I'd recommend Cazic Thule but.... <g>

Solusek's Eye (SolA) is a GREAT place for experience AND loot from level
20-35.  It really helps to have someone around who knows the dungeon though.
Upper Guk is probably another excellent place until about the same level.
Low 30s can do quite well in Lower Guk as long as you don't venture TOO far
out.

Droga/Nurga another option though I don't know either zone very well.
Dalnirs is great from 20-50 but it's so freaking far from ANYTHING.
Speaking of being in BFE, there's Splitpaw, too.
