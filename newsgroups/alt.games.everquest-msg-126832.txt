First off who or what will be PL you? Kaesora is good or maybe you can get
someone to take you to The Hole (after 40), Both zones have a good exp bonus
but being you are an Enchanter I would be more concerned with learning the
class. Enchanters take on an entirely different role after 40 that PL won't
teach you. Tanks and healers are no big deal to PL but Enchanters, Bards,
and even Monks take on some added responsibility after 40 that only comes
with grouping and practice.
