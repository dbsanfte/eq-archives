Unless they've changed the rules it's not. I've been told repeatedly by
guides and gms that once the exclusive timer is up the corpse is ffa. I've
had my phenocryst focus blown TWICE by ninjalooters, and I can't count the
number of times someone has stolen minor loot while I've been dealing with
adds and such.

OTOH just because he claimed he it was his spawn doesn't mean jack. Hell
I've been told even if you have to run a 100 hour quest to trigger the damn
spawn if someone else engages first it's their kill (I participated in the
Coldain 10th ring war for a friend's guild when some other guild dropped the
hammer on the boss mob and their guy turned in his head for the 10th ring.
The GM said there wasn't anything he could do as they got first blood on the
attack (they were apparently waiting invis where he spawns.)
