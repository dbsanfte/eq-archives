Druid spells are sold at about half the druid rings in Norrath, and at least
one, NK, has a druid trainer (Briana Treewhisper, I think the name is)
stationed there, so once you get a few levels up, you never really need
a druid guild again.

Hmm, also druid spells in Firiona Vie, and in Wakening Lands in the
tower that holds the zone to PoG.  Oh, and every casting class has
their 34 (39 for hybrids) spell at the igloo in Iceclad and from the
priest in Thurgadin.
