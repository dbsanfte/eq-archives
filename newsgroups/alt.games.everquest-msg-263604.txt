If by foolish you mean, running a business in a town soon to be 
overtaken by walmart, losing your shirt because you couldn't sell 
because everyone knew it was a losing proposition now, and then having 
to feed the family you used to provide for by taking any work you can 
find at any wage you can get. Unable to afford even to move to another 
town because your failed business has killed your credit. You can't buy 
insurance against that...

Some people are going to lose at capitalism. Not all of them are 
"lazy welfare sucking jerks".

Yeah, its a pure fantasy to say that everyone has a chance. The real 
world is like the lottery in that there is a statistical chance that 
*anyone* can win and a statisfical gaurantee that everyone won't. No 
matter what. In fact in the highly unlikely event that everyone did 
simultaneously win the lottery the payout would be divided so many ways 
that you'd win less than the price of your ticket. Everyone CANNOT win.

Like the lottery Capitalism is a pyramid of winners and losers. Anyone 
*can* win... but not everyone will, no matter what. You can't build a 
pyramid without people at every level, and the majority of the people 
are going to be at the bottom. Each time someone at the bottom moves up 
someone from the top moves down. There isn't enough room at the top for 
everyone, period. 

The role of government is to ensure that the bottom of the period can 
sustain a reasonable living, and ideally to minimize the barriers 
between moving between the echelons.

That is true but for the wrong reasonsy. 

It is not their decisions that make wealth

It is their relationships. Their friends and families are similiarly 
wealthy, have relevant skill sets (investing, brokerage, money 
management, etc), and position (lawmakers, corporate directors, 
governors, etc).

You take away a Kennedy's money, and yes he'll get it all back. Himself, 
his friends, and his family will still be in positions of power (even if 
they're stripped of wealth); they'll still be able to leverage nepotism 
up the corporate ladder, they still have their wealthy foriegn investor 
friends, they still know how to administer and direct businesses because 
that's what they've all gone to school for.

However if you redistribute them a la Dark City to truly even it out. 
Leave their 'souls' intact but remove their assets, friends, and ideally 
even their skill sets, and see if they'd be able to 'decide' themselves 
back into wealth and power. Set them up renting a condo because he can't 
afford to buy, put him in a job that won't quite give him full time 
hours so he's perpetually short, give him friends in positions like 
McDonalds manager, Assistant manager at the Gap, columnist, small 
grocery store owner, freelance graphic artist, photographer, systems 
analyst, and forensic auditor. (Respectable jobs but not world shapers). 
He certainly can't afford to go to school, and the bank won't lend a 
dime to because he has no assets, no wealth, no co-signatories, and no 
one knows him from Adam.

Will he make it? Maybe. There's nothing stopping him. But most people in 
that position don't ever make it to the top, and he's got nothing going 
for him that 300 million other people don't have.

A "paid for" education and the freedom to pursue it, and a life of hob-
nobbing with world leaders, Saudi investers, corporate directors, and 
the political and financial elite will go along way to securing you a 
position. You really just have to *not fuck it up*. 

There are enough people holding your hand and ready to catch you that an 
'average' person of average intelligence in that environment will 
succeed.
