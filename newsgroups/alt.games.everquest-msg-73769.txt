Er uh WTH u thinking bud?
    Those who donated to the site donated because of the functionality e.g.
because the denmother IS able to verifiy the recipies, vendor locations,
trivial levels etc etc etc.  Not to mention that your talking about someone
who is supporting literaly thousands of others with HER hard work and her
personal cash, time, energy!
    Whats yer gripe anyway... You visit this site obviously so you must
think she does a good job of keeping it up... I don't know if you've ever
maintained let alone build a website as vast as EQTC but hell just tracking
down problems in cross-browser support can take hours...  And she does all
of that AND spends countless hours(along with others gracious enough to keep
the rest of us informed) finding proofing and getting trivial info.
    So I'm guessing your volenteering to do all the leg work for her in
luclin then? Nah didn't think so...
If u don't like the site stay the hell away from it 'cause she sure as hell
don't need u visiting it.
