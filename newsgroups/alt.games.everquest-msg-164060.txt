I was wondering if other people were having the same difficulty completing
this quest as I am.  I have all the pieces except the gauntlets because I
cannot find a Black Wolf Tooth. I have killed Black Wolves across 5 zones
and if I kill anymore there will be none left in all of Norrath.  As a
comparison, my group as looted 5 pristine drakeling scales and 6 russet
oxides in less time.

To top it off, when I send tells out, people tell me they have never seen
one.  Am I unlucky, or is this an ultra rare drop, or is this a broken
quest?

Thank you for your feedback!
