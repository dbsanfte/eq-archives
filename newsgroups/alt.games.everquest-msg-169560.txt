Well, for me at least, it takes a lot more effort to read purposely
misspelled words.  When I read I read whole words and phrases at once, I
don't read each individual letter.  When things are misspelled a lot, I have
to make out each individual word, and that takes a lot more time and effort
on my part.  Personally, I find it quite annoying, and tend to avoid
speaking with people that do that.  It has nothing to do with roleplaying or
not.  I don't find the practice to be offensive, just quite annoying.
