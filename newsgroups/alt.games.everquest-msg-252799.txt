I'm afraid that is an inconsistent application of logic.

First you assert that playing on a PvP world implies player acceptance 
of risk of losing 'real world valuable assets'.

  -- and --

Second you assert that playing on a non-PvP world guarantees player 
legal *protection* from risk of losing 'valuable real world assets', 
even when the player willingly hands them over (for promised rewards 
outside what can be accomplished with the 'secure trading window'), even 
when the risk is explicitly stated in the EULA, and players are 
explicitly advised *not* to do it, and that Sony is not going to help 
them recover the loss.

I'm sorry you can't have that both ways.

Personally, I agree with your acceptance of risk argument. And think it 
applies equally to the situation where a player hands thousands of pp to 
another player. If you are dealing with game assets, and you exchange 
them with other players, anything you negotiate outside the secure trade 
window is implied acceptance of risk.

If you want to try to earn a livlihood, and can't tolerate that risk, 
you shouldn't be there. In fact, since the EULA specifically forbids 
selling items for cash, then its seems blatantly obvious that anyone 
trying to sell items for cash has explicitly accepted the risks.

Even then, they cheated at a video game, they didn't rob your house. I 
would still be apalled if someone were tossed in *jail* for exploiting 
in a video game.

If I turn around and sell all the cash i exploited for real USD, what 
the hell do i care if you toss my character in jail, and take half his 
wealth (which at this point would be 0). =)

Sure you could, but then it has nothing to do with the courts. The 
question at hand is legal recognition of virtual 'assets'. There is no 
question that there are umpteen zillion ways this sort of thing can be 
dealt with in the game, but that's not relevant. Whats relevant is if US 
(or any other) law also applies to these 'assets'.
