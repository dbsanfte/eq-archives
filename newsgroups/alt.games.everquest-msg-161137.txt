Previous post about a quartet made me decide to post this.

A good friend of mine in the game and I are going to start a Warrior/Shaman
duo.  Due to an influx of money with my cleric, both of us will be twinked
rather nicely so loot is hardly ever going to be a factor.

Basically just looking for any pointers, zone suggestions etc.  Right now I
am thinking we will start leveling in Shadeweaver's Thicket or some such
good newbie zone and do the old world rotation from there, the Ro's Oasis,
LOIO (lack of having to group with other people should hopefully reduce some
of the annoyance of this zone) and play it by ear from there.  Any downtime
is no real big deal since the two of us enjoy talking to each other anyway
and that will fill up any downtime.

Anyways, any ideas, suggestions, snide remarks would all be appreciated.
Thank you all in advance.
