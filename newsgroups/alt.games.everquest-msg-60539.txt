Heh, in one of my senior computer science classes during undergrad, one of
our professors made an offhad comment that..."software will expand and fill
the extra space as memory and disk storage capacity increases."

Some of it has to do with the fact the Pentium processors are 32-bit.  (Each
word now takes twice the space to store the SAME value.)
