"Some people talk a lot of shit. These people think they have very massive
cocks and thus, allowed to talk such nonsense. This is to inform those
people of one thing: suck our collective Godzilla sized cock..."

Congratulations FoH for once again proving to us all that an Education is a
good thing.

What this guild has achieved in EQ is means little to me, it neither
impresses, bothers or effects me. What their website screams out is that
they are a bunch of idiots who are likely the bane of every other player on
their server, I am sure that those hunting in DS are now relieved they might
actually get a shot at the spawns there.

I'd love to be able to add a congrats on achieving this could never bring
myself to do such a thing after reading their right up for it.

"FoH domination... again

Please don't h8"

Hate is to strong a word...pity I think is more suited.
