I assume you mean he can either get himself to safety, or somehow save
the children and himself perish.  Bit of a reach, but ok I'll play.

Yes.  No one has a greater right to life than another person, ever.
One of those children might have grown up to discover the cure for
cancer.  Since the future is unknowable, you are simply in no position
to judge whose life will ultimately turn out to have been more
important.  Were I a religious person, I would say only God can know
that.  Since I'm not, I will simply say that thinking that *your* life
is more important than someone else's is the first step on the road to
psychopathology and, if you will, evil.

But that is the way an individual will likely phrase it to himself and
what we are talking about here is an individual thinking himself more
important -- i.e., more entitled to life, creature comforts, power,
wealth, whatever.

I see nothing about my definition which makes it boolean.  A number
can be positive or negative, but nevertheless remain in a particular
position on a scale of positivity/negativity.

A husband thoughtlessly supposing his creature comforts are more
important than his wife's is performing an evil act, but not one of
major proportions and his wife may very well forgive him.

Stalin killing thousands or even millions so that he may remain in
power is performing an act of monstrous evil and his forgiveness will
be correspondingly hard (if not impossible) to come by.
