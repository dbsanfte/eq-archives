It's a fair question. luckily, it works in the easy, obvious way, 
40+15=55%.

And luckily, most oddball ways of trying to calculate it give you numbers 
not divisible by 5, so you can tell someone's not quite got it right when 
they advertise, say, 43%.

Well, either that, or I did find one oddball case that probably won't 
happen anymore.  Someone was advertising 72%... it turned out she'd had 
people reporting back to her when her KEI faded, so she could time it and 
find out how long the extension -really- was.  Of course, all those people 
reporting back had zoned a few times... Which explained the slight 
variance in her results.

Another amusing new buff timer story:  I have permanent illusion and cast 
Illusion: Halfling on myself last night to annoy a groupmate.  My mouse 
wandered over the icon, and I noticed it was due to fade in a mere 1700 
minutes!  Permanent, my butt!
