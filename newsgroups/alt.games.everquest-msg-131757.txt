What's pathetic is people who are completely clueless about issues
farting out opinions.

The proposed HIV+ muppet is for a segment of Sesame Street to air in
Africa, only Africans would ever see it.  The character is intended to
help these kids deal with HIV, in an area that sees 10% or more of
people be HIV+.  This is something those kids are already dealing with
today, and the show is (was?) trying to be a responsible kids show by
helping them deal with issues in their lives- including the fact that
many of them will know other kids how are HIV+.

Unfortunately the ignorant masses got their self-righteousness tied up
in knots, and the character may be scrapped because people who would
NEVER have been exposed or affected by this muppet want use their
right to voice ignorant opinions.  Way to go.
