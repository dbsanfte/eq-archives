I love the way people that have no idea how trials work believe you can walk
right up to one with no one that has been through before and waltz right through
it. Only people I have seen do this are 5 level 65s and one runt that they are
pushing through the trial. Being a Beastlord, one very high DPS class that can
slow the Exec I am in high demand for my guild trials. I hate turning them down
but takes away from my 2nd tier playing time. Losing a group in there means
waiting a while for a new one or losing a prime spot in a plane group. Not to
mention I have not been able to get much action in BoT because I spend to much
time getting my guildies flagged for 2nd tier. Time to put to bed this asinine
concept of the trials and let those that want to move on do so. Only ones that
really don't want the flagging removed are the ones that have gotten there and
could care less if anyone else makes it or not. I guess I care too much that my
friends get there with me and it holds me back trying to get them with me.
