It's perfectly applicable when you consider that they both show a
complete lack of civility and respect for those around you.

Oh, but they *do* hurt, just not physically. Physical is not the only
flavor of pain, now is it? This poster has two choices. Continue to
read this group and subject herself to something that truly bothers
her (I'm guessing at the extent by the simple fact that she exposed
herself to the juvenile flaming to speak out) or not. Why does she
have to make that choice just because people use excessive profanity?
Besides, it's not like she is asking for it to be eliminated - just
toned down.

Avoiding the use of foul language *on occasion* is such a minor thing
- hardly an inconvenience - which obviously means a great deal more to
someone else. Why *wouldn't* you go even that far for someone? Is that
so much to ask to encourage another presence and viewpoint on the
issues of the day around here?

You're an idiot if you don't know the answer to that one. I don't
think either the original poster or I ever referred to it as "evil"
per se. That kind of language is just foul. Would you want your child
spewing such filth? Would you feel comfortable speaking in such a
manner around your priest/minister/rabbi/etc, parents, bank teller,
child's school principal?

If you would answer yes to any of those, then you are a cretin and I
don't much care what you may have further to say on the subject.

However, I don't feel that is the case. I've read your posts. You
don't appear to be any more opinionated or cantankerous than I would
have to admit to being. You can't say that using foul language is not
rude though.
