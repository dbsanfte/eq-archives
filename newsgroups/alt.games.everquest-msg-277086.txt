Two games I play a lot, Astral Tournament and the sequel Astral Masters, 
are clearly influenced by MtG.  (And neither use physical collectable 
cards.)  I don't think percentages matter much here, though I would 
guess the value is between 0.01% and 1%.

You're comparing a single game to "role-playing games" in general?

Neither is anyone else.

No we aren't. We are talking about a new game that does, or might.

I don't know, but if they don't like it, they should try another game.

Then let them invent their own games, and have the best of both worlds - 
money and the games they want to play. In their own languages, even.

I don't think so either.  So if somebody wants to make such a game, why 
not let them try?  Instead of making rabid accusations against a company 
that has not even done what you accuse them of wanting to do.
