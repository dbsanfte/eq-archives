I'm going to give you a dissenting opinion: go with the AC for now.
At level 19, tanking with damage shield is still quite viable, and
will be for quite a few more levels if your AC is reasonably good.
You want to keep your Defense skill going up as long as you can,
or you will regret it later. Defense points == free AC.
