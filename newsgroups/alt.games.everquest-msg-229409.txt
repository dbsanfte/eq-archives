: Depends:

:  I  usually donate 40 - 50.

: Aego:  Id consider you an ass if you dontated any less than 30 pp

: Temperance:  Id consider you an ass if you dontated any less than 20pp
: I usually donate 20 - 30

For all the above I donate 2-3 Dots (depends on the char level because I
don't share too much between chars).  I feel that is fair for a "donation".
If, the cleric is broadcasting "open trade window for easy targetting", they
generally do not get my business.

:
: KEI:  Id consider you an ass if you donated any less than 20 pp...
: I usually donate 30 - 50 depending on my need....

I offer 30 to 50 pp also.  But, see above.  If they are offering for free or
donate if you wish, I donate.  If the are "charging", I beat feet to someone
else if my guild mates are not available.

:
: This is just me... not many people are really "worried" if I think
: them an ass... just my personal stance.

Anyone that charges should just say "50pp or equivelent".  If it's is for
"donations", then take what you get.  For some reason, people seem to think
"donation" is a euphamism for "charge what I can get".
