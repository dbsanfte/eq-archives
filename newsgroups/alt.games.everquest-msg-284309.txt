Warrens, Unrest, Crushbone, Warrens, UGuk, Befallen,  and HHK look like the
big winners, Sol A and Najena in the running with Unrest, as far as ZEM's go
on that chart.

Sol A mobs went cyan to me a few levels ago though, or at least most 
did... perhaps somewhere in the gnome area is still blue at 44?

What I'm thinking, from looking at this chart, is that HHK may be the 
golden ticket I've forgotten about; what level are the nobles in there? 
  What precisely are the faction hits, so I can try and convince people 
to come join me?

I spent some time in OOT with a group doing seafury cyclops yesterday 
and got decent exp, but they didn't like it and opted for Mistmore... 
exp dropped into the bucket for me, I got about a blue in the time I'd 
gotten a yellow on Seafuries.  Yes, we killed ten times as many mobs, 
but many were cyan to me at 43, and green at 44.  I wouldn't complain, 
since in the group was a friend with her 34 cleric, but she too said 
that her exp per hour had been faster with the SC's.  I don't see a ZEM 
listed for OOT there.
