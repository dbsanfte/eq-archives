Are you certain that this is intentional in the game, or is it just that
they aren't dropping items as-is yet because it is still in beta?  If it
is the game I think it is, I'm very curious to see how they do, as they
are full of "Great ideas" but are lacking some of the savvy that SOE has.  

After all, who but a savvy MMORPG company would think to add
"anti-training" code into the game?  

Insofar as EQ2 is concerned, I was pleased to hear that in the lower-level
portions of the game, tradeskill-able items are in fact the better
options, but not only are both available, they even out in power at the
high end.  High level tradeskill items hold the "edge" in that the "purple
dragon skin" can be used to make an item for any class, whereas the sword
of purple dragon slaying that drops is only melee useable.  The items
achieved in the end are both powerful, but more people can use the purple
dragon skin, so the tradeskillers have plenty to do.
