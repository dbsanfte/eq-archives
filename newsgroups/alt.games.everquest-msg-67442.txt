By 53 very little will agro, so that's not much of a concern.  I
happen to know a early-40's enchanter who was able to solo
the Preacher, Alchemist, and Archeologist camps in rotation
and my cleric did the same in the high-40's.  A 53 warrior will
have no trouble in those camps.   Taking the Scryer or King's
Room might be a different story, though.   Both those camps
had too much agro for my cleric to handle alone.  Then again
a warrior doesn't have to worry about either spell interruptions
or mana management, either.
