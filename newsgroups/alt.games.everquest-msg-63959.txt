Tomorrow I'm scheduled to go to a branch office that's 40 miles the OTHER
way from work (and I live 40 miles from work).  Because I'm going to that
branch I don't have to drive all the way back to work (about 90 from that
office) to work just a couple hours to head back home.  I love my boss. :)

I scheduled it for tomorrow because of SoL. :p
