    Being a human her base INT will be low. That means a lot of the usual
suggestions (drop Batskulls for Gold Black Sapphire ears, or drop the Amulet
for a Black Sapphire neck) won't apply to her. As she gets to planes level,
though, she'll get access to a lot of stuff that will help. So will her
Thurg gear.

> Primary Melee: Glowing Black Stone
> Secondary Melee: Stein of Moggok
> Ranged Weapon: Frozen Orb

    She's done some of the Coldain Shawl quests. Help her get to number
five, and along the way she'll pick up a better ranged slot item and might
get some INT leggings off the shardwurms, too.

> Ear: Batskull Earring
> Ear: Batskull Earring
> Neck: Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet

    Platinum / Velium Sapphire Necklace will have more INT, and some
possibly useful STR.

> Face: Sheer Bone Mask

    Temple of Solusek Ro, Acumen Mask. Look up the quest on Allakhazam's or
Graffe's. Also tell her about Graffe's if she doesn't go there now.

> Head: Nightshade Wreath

    Next upgrade is a Runed Cowl from Lower Guk. While there she could also
try and get a Shiny Metallic Robe as a robe upgrade.

> Shoulder: Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl
> Finger: Rose Velium Engagement Ring
> Finger: Rose Platinum Engagement Ring
> Wrist: Drake Scale Bracelet
> Wrist: Polished Bone Bracelet

    Golden Chitin Bracers. Possibly Velium Blue Diamond Bracers, if she
needs the resists and has the cash (they're fairly pricey).

> Arm: Gatorscale Sleeves
> Chest: Crystalline Robes
> Back: Mystic Cloak
> Feet: Kobold Hide Boots

    Golden Efreeti Boots. Standard INT-caster gear. The nine INT would give
her a lot of wiggle room in the other slots for resists/MANA/HPs.

> Legs: Mammoth Hide Leggings

    See above about the two INT leggings off the Shardwurms in GD. Legs are
a weak point for most INT casters - there's not a lot out there that goes on
legs that helps INT or MANA at the midlevels.

> Waist: Braided Cinch Cord

    The Crystalline Fur Belt from Velk's is a minor upgrade on her Cinch
Cord, but not much (it has INT 3 HP/MANA 20). Most people undervalue it
strongly, though - I've been able to sell a Cinch Cord and buy a Belt for
the exact same amount within a five minute span. She may be able to do the
same.
