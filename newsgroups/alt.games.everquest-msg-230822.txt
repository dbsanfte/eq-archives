This is precisely what I'm saying.  For sitting around not meleeing, the 
epic isn't bad.  For doing damage however, nothing (not even nuking) 
beats summoned hammer.  my point, though is that -Definately- the epic 
doesn't beat summoned hammer.

I had some weapons that outdid epic in melee terms before hitting 56, 
can't even recall what they were but it wasn't anything astounding, 
Adjele's Ceremonial Cudgel, a couple others.  In most cases however I 
was better off nuking and sitting back down; only the summoned hammer 
line made cleric melee really worth while after about 44 (these days 
weapons upgrades might extend that till 50+)

Oh, and I was indeed proud to own a prismatic 1hb (weild it till it 
procs, put it away till 10 minute duration runs out) and Sap Encrusted 
Branch (procs Ensnare, again, put it away after it does... but dammit it 
procs so rarely even at 255 dex that its hardly worth using, it suck 
away massive amounts of my DPS till it does go off)

Splendid
