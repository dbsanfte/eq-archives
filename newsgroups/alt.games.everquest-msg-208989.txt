Don't ignore root in a situation like that. Root one and tell your
partner to back up so only one is hitting on him. 

Overall though, I'd say yes. You're usually better off healing (or
medding for a heal) than nuking when things go bad. In the time that
your melee partner takes damage equal to what you can heal, he'll
almost always do more damage than you could have done using that mana
for nuking.
