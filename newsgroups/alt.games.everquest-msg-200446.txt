Yes, cleric is a often looked for class in there. As a lvl25 I did most of
the rooms as part of a group. THe top rooms are good steady xp for pretty
much any groups of that level. For the lower rooms with higher level mobs 
then as party cleric you are fine - but you really want the tanks to be a
bit higher level and a decent chanter would be veru useful
