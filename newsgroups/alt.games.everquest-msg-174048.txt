You've got that part right.  But you rapidly go down

to start lying.

"Almost certainly", eh?  Got any photos of them
flying by, spraying?  I thought not.  And what about
the "and planes", couldn't you make up a way to blame
the US for those too?

But what's your point -- that we're somehow complicit
because they might have used US-made helicopters?  That
this somehow implies that we approved of the gassings?
Make an accusation, or withdraw it, but your laughably
cheesy innuendo is just childish.

Yes, Iraq bought a few dozen American Bell helicopters in
the 80's, after the US *explicitly* got assurances
that they would be used only for civilian use.  The same
can't be said of the Soviets and the French, however.
All of Iraq's *military* helicopters are Soviet or French.

Between 1982 and 1987, Iraq received from France
about 100 Gazelle, Super-Frelon, and Alouette helicopters,
and from the Soviets the Soviet Hind equipped with
AT-2 Swatter, and BO-105s equipped with AS-11 antitank
guided weapons.  Not to mention *hundreds* of fighter
jets and bombers, and countless missiles.

And you're trying to smear the US because we sold them
some *Bells*?

I know it's an article of faith among loony-liberals
that the gas attacks were carried out by helicopters
from the Evil USA, but I've never seen them give
any actual *evidence* for it.  On the contrary, the
only specific link I've found involved chemical/biological
weapons pods in conjunction with *SOVIET* helicopters:

   "In the late 1980s, U.N. arms experts say, military
   researchers at this sleepy airfield north of Baghdad
   tested the Zubaidy device, a helicopter-mounted
   contraption that could disperse deadly bacteriological
   agents from the air.
   [snip]
   "They spent almost five hours at the site, walking
   inside three large camouflage-painted hangars and looking
   at a collection of rusty, ***Soviet-made*** helicopters, 
   chemical tanks and spraying nozzles scattered on the tarmac. 
   [snip]
   "The facility has about 25 aging Soviet Mi-2 helicopters,
   but only about nine work, he said. The rest need spare
   parts whose import has been blocked by a U.N. committee
   enforcing economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
   invasion of Kuwait."
     -- Washington Post, 12/02/02

Furthermore, eyewitness accounts of the Kurd gassings
describe chemical *bombs* being used (in green casings,
if you want details), not sprays (apparently the
description above was for forays, no the Kurds).  Helicopters
fire missiles, they don't drop bombs.  Planes drop bombs.
So just how many US *helicopters* likely gassed the
Kurds?

That would be a really neat trick, since Bush was only
the Vice President at the time -- since when did VP's
gain veto power?

Are you sure you know what the fuck you're talking about?

The *real* history of the bill (S2763, the Pell Bill)
is that the Senate passed it on 9/9/88, handed it over
to the House on 9/13/88, which referred it to the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs (same day), which
passed the ball to the House Committee on Ways and Means
(still same day).  The HCWM pondered it for a few days,
then on 9/28/88 bounced it back to the Senate with a formal
rejection via H.Res. 552, which, according to the
official summary:

   Expresses the opinion of the House of Representatives
   that S. 2763, which imposes sanctions and calls for
   United Nations action against Iraq, contravenes the U.S.
   Constitution and is an infringement of the privileges
   of the House. Returns such bill to the Senate. 

In other words, they reminded the Senate that it's a
violation of the separations of powers for Congress
to urge the UN to do anything -- that's the job of
the Executive branch (i.e., the President).  The
sticking point was the following provision in S2763:

   Requests the Secretary of State to bring before
   the United Nations Security Council the matter of
   Iraq's use of poison gas against its own nationals
   and to demand that measures be taken against Iraq for
   its repeated use of chemical weapons.
     [official legislative summary]

But there were other problematic provisions as well, like
requiring the U.S. Executive Director to vote against all
loans to Iraq.  Again, as the name implies, the "Executive
Director" is part of the Executive branch of government,
and he takes his orders only from the President.

In short the Senate got carried away in the heat of the
moment and tried to overstep their constitutional bounds.
The House of Representatives said, "think again..."

So no, "Bush" didn't veto it (he was the Vice President
at the time, you dolt.)

Neither did Reagan.  Read this if you don't believe me,
it's a complete list of every Presidential veto
(including pocket vetoes) since 1981:
   http://www.house.gov/burton/RSC/PresidentialVetoes.PDF

See any vetoes there about Iraqi sanctions?  For S2763?
Any vetoes of bills sponsored by Sen. Pell?  I didn't think
so.

Next time get your facts straight before you try to tell
us "exactly" what happened.

Rather than just remove the unconstitutional sections,
the Senate tossed the matter to the Subcommittee on
International Development Institutions and Finance
on 10/1/88, which made a lateral pass to the
Subcommittee on International Finance, Trade and Monetary
Policy (same day), where it apparently faded away because
that's the end of the Congressional paper trail on it.

Presumably they figured it was rendered moot,
because by then Reagan had stepped up to the plate
and did (from his position at the top of the
Executive branch) what the Congress was trying to
do in the first place, which was to kick the UN in
the rump and get them involved in the matter.

As a 1/12/89 Houston Chronicle article put it:

   "Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran and 
   Iraq's Kurdish minority - graphic pictures of 
   peasants killed in Iranian villages heightened
   concerns last year - provided a somber backdrop
   for the conference, which was formally proposed
   by President Reagan at the United Nations in
   September."

The chemical weapons conference was held in Paris
and brought together 149 nations which hammered
out a declaration and signed it.

  "The six-point declaration affirms the U.N. 
  role in investigating chemical weapons use and 
  called for a strengthening of existing procedures
  at the United Nations in dealing with such
  use - a reference to enacting sanctions."

And:

  "Arab nations said they wanted to reserve
   the right to possess chemical weapons to
   counter what they claim is a nuclear threat
   from Israel."

(That was voted down.)  And as long as we're
looking for nations to scapegoat:

   "The Iraqis have powerful friends. Both the
   Soviet Union and France, the conference host,
   supplied the Iraqi armed forces with conventional
   weapons, while Arab states gave Iraq vital
   diplomatic, military and financial support
   in the war. A West German concern is said to
   have furnished Iraq with its chemical-arms plant."

So...  I thought you said that "looking the
other way" was, in your words, "exactly" what
the US did when Saddam gassed the Kurds.

You're "exactly" wrong.  The Senate went apeshit,
Reagan personally brought the world together to
deal with Iraq (the UN, unfortunately, ended up
being as wishy-washy as usual) and related chemical
weapons threats (Libya became a hot topic).  As I
browsed the Houston Chronicle archives for 1988-1989
in order to verify my memory on this stuff I ran
across a *shitload* of constant articles all through
late 1988 and *all* of 1989 which chronicled the US's
continuing hard line against Iraq and unfading outrage
over the chemical weapon attacks.  You couldn't be
more wrong when you try to disgustingly imply that
it was "business as usual" for us -- it's no
exaggeration whatsoever to say that the gassing
of the Kurds was the last straw for US-Iraq relations;
they had already been shaky during the last few years
of the Iran-Iraq war, when Iraq seemed the lesser
of two evils, but the Kurd gassing caused all the
fence-sitters to go leaping off in unison.  There's
not a single favorable, or even neutral, article
about Iraq any time past the gassings.  There's not
a single bit of "business as usual" -- every single
article has the same "we don't trust those bastards
as far as we can throw them, what are they up to
and what are they hiding" tone that articles today
have.  The business sections were full of mention of
broken trade deals with Iraq.  And this was *before*
the invasion of Kuwait.

Taking a hard line against Iraq was one of the
elder Bush's campaign planks:

   He said the verification system of such an 
   agreement "will be an enormously difficult task.
   But the alternative is far worse to contemplate.
   We must outlaw these weapons, once and for all.
   Nothing less is acceptable."

   Bush also cited the human horror of chemical warfare
   demonstrated recently in the Iran-Iraq war. "I thought
   we had banished forever what we all saw only a few months
   ago: a mother trying to protect her child, waving her
   arms against the invisible winds of death - chemical
   weapons."

   Bush said nations that engage in chemical warfare
   should face severe international sanctions, but he
   did not spell out exactly what they should be.
        -- 10/22/88

So in short, you're talking out of your ass.

Is that the best you've got?  An error-filled string
of false innuendo?  Where's the alleged evidence
for your moronic insistence that the US kneeled
down and kissed Saddam's ass for oil?


>The White House later granted Baghdad a loan of a
>billion dollars.

It was a loan guarantee for *food*, you jackass.
Thanks for the grossly misleading description, though --
now I'll know not to trust anything else you say
without triple checking it, given your habit of
misrepresentation.

The US Department of Agriculture has a longstanding
program via its Commodity Credit Corporation, whereby
approved countries can buy food products from US
farmers "on credit" and pay for it later.  It's a
win-win program, usually -- US farmers get more
markets for their products, and struggling countries
get needed food assistance without the risk that
just giving them money would (since they could divert
that to other less humanitarian uses).

The US approved a $900 million loan guarantee to
Iraq FOR FOOD on 11/08/89, and Iraq certainly needed
it -- they were in very bad shape economically
in 1989, having just ended the devastating Iran-Iraq
war.  They were so bad off that many advisers
warned that even with its oil sales, Iraq might
not be able to repay the loaned food.

What would you have us do, let them starve?

It was also hoped that the humanitarian assistance
would provide a safe "carrot" to encourage Iraq
to rejoin the community of peaceful nations.
Unfortunately Iraq had other plans, but you can
hardly blame us for trying.

Taras, have you no shame?  Are you really so low
as to try to misrepresent food assistance as some
sort of immoral robber-baron transaction?  I guess
you *are* that low.

Earlier I expressed a wish to find adults to
discuss these issues with.  Let me amend
that:  I'd like to find *honest* adults.


>It wasn't until 1990, when ammunition for

>Kurds.

You're an idiot.  See above.  The US didn't
"suddenly discover the Kurds" when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, they were a continuing story, and so was
the outrage over the use of chemical weapons as
its own topic.

So was Iraq, it was mentioned in 731 Houston
Chronicle articles between 09/01/88 and 08/01/90.

For example:

   Recent world changes have rendered the "evil
   empire" a friend who needs our aid to progress 
   on the road to democracy. We still face a major
   danger from Russian terrorist allies who are now
   getting their supplies from both East and West.
   Iraq has been using poison gas against its Kurdish
   minority. It is completing an atomic bomb project
   and has ballistic missiles. Its contempt for freedom
   is shown by the execution of an international journalist. 
     -- 03/22/90


>Had Iraq never invaded Kuwait, presumably he would
>still be gassing them with bigger and better US
>made helicopters. Business is business, you know.

I take it back -- you're not an idiot, you're an asshole.
You don't have a shred of support for an inexcusable
slur like that.  The US went absolutely bonkers over
the gassing of the Kurds, and things were never again
"business as usual", you dickhead.  The gassing of the
Kurds caused an instantaneous end to normal (if you
could even call them that pre-1988) trade between
the US and Iraq.  I *remember* those events, don't
try to misrepresent them.

Do you really think that lying helps your argument?
