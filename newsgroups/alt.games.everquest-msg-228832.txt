Then I dont understand your point. SOE is a business. Their sole
purpose is to make money. They only measure their success with the
amount of money they make. The more choices they give consumers, the
better for everyone.

So what is the problem here? They give you a choice to purchase it,
and its up to you. Whats wrong with giving consumers choices? Granted,
they try to jam it down your throat some, but thats typical these days
with all media (unfortunately).

So are you saying you think they should give away expansions for free?
Or, they should leave the game as it is and let it stagnate? What is
the ideal situation in your eyes?

Again, this is a buisiness and those that make the most money will be
around longer, its that simple. They would be fools not to try and
capitalize on this as much as they can. The more money they make, the
more they can provide back to us. Had it not been for all of these
expansions, EQ would have died long ago. The rate at which many
consume new content is staggering. If you had LDON, id suggest you
look at your server's adventure point ranking. If its anything like
the server I play on, theres MANY players with 200+ points with
several over 400. This is just after 3 months of release. Sony is
trying to stay ahead of 24/7 players and keep them engrossed in the
game.

Again - I just have to ask... so what? You can buy the products you
want when you want it. Are you ready for more? Yes? Great go and
purchase more. No? Then just enjoy what you have. Why does the fact
that Sony is making money on this game (from willing consumers)
irritate you so much?
