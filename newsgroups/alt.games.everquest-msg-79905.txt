You have forced me to rethink.  How about a random spot midway between
the surface and the floor of the ocean and facing a random direction,
including possibly down?  Modify swimming so that PAGE UP can actually
bring you all the way back to swimming deeper.  Add that when a
Soulbinder kills you, you always respawn with rez effects until you
complete a quest for them to restore your normal binding ability.
