Being a 24-year-old male I am automatically loud, narcissistic,
irresponsible, stupid, rude, egotistical, insensitive, completely
noncommittal, and drunk half the time, right?

Tell me something, any/everyone:  Am I the only man who notices how stupidly
my gender behaves?  I don't claim to be a paragon of wisdom but some of the
things I've seen men do -- not just once, but repeatedly, as if it was
actually a good idea -- baffle me.  It has amazed me more than once that men
are 49% of the population, instead of about 30%, the rest having met an ugly
and spectacular death at the hands of their own foolishness.
