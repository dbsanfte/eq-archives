    People often find error in that if you jump or fall/move towards or away
from the ground, that your /loc changes only on the Z coordinate. Also that
the X and Y coordinates don't appear to match what we consider the X, Y, Z
axis as we know it.
    Actually that is possible, to have people move up and down on the Z
axis.  Look at the Earth.  If you are on the equator then when you jump, in
relevance to the center of the earth, you're moving along the Earth's Z
axis.  So we know that part is possible.  Its the X and Y axis that make
things more confusing.
    The X axis coordinates in Norath are your latitude (distance North to
South) and the Y axis coordinates in Norath are your Longitude (distance
East to West).
    Due to the fact that there appear to be no wind currents (like the
different wind patterns at various latitude segments of Earth) it would be
reasonable to assume that Norath does not spin on its axis, and that the
moving of the sun and the moon both orbit Norath, leaving the planet of
Norath the center of the universe.
    More proof to this is that both the sun and moon orbit Norath, yet you
never see an eclipse of either, or either ever having changes in their
orbital phases as Earth's moon does.
    First of all, Norath is tilted to one side by 90�.  This causes the
North pole to become the X axis of the planet.  The continents we know of on
Norath appear to be on the side of the planet so that if you were seeing
Norath with its North pole towards the positive end of the X axis, then the
currently discovered land masses of Norath would be on the back side of the
planet, thus allowing the Eastward direction (90� clockwise of North) to be
pointed towards the Y axis.
    We do know that the sun orbits Norath from East to West, and the moon
orbits Norath from North to South (or other way around, but I'm pretty sure
its North to South).  Seeing how the two keep perfect timing with one
another, neither causing eclipse of the other (which isn't possible if
they're on separate axis of orbit), their orbital speed and distance are in
direct proportion of one another.
    Even if Norath does rotate on its axis, the orbits of the sun and the
moon would have to be as such that the sun would have to orbit in such a way
as to not cause loss of synchronization with its timing of positioning over
the sky, as well as the orbit of the moon would need to be adjusted to
maintain accurate passage, while at the same time not interfering with the
sun or causing eclipse, an event yet to have been witnessed by Norath.  If
such synchronization were to occur, they would be rare as they have yet to
be documented.  The complications of such possibilities further adds to the
likeliness that Norath is the central part of its solar system, and does not
rotate upon an axis.
    Just another theory...
