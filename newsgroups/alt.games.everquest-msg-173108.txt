As an enchanter, I'd love it if the thing were nerfed to obey the level
limits on post-50 spells.  I've had my screen go solid purple from tells
begging for C3 within seconds of zoning into the Nexus.  There's something
wrong with having that many people doing nothing but hanging around Nexus
spamming "/who 60 65 enchanter" repeatedly until someone zones in.

But I haven't heard any rumors of any nerf like that going in on Test, so
I'm thinking it's just another rumor.
