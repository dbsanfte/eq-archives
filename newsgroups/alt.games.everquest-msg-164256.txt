    If you have a single level 62 ENC in guild with Speed of Vallon (which
doesn't require an uberguild to get), you lost no haste and no ATK since you
weren't using your epic effect anyways. Remember, a 65 monk isn't soloing
anything for XP anyways. HPs and stats lost is much more serious - you're
looking at between 65 HPs (Kael gloves) lost to 25 HPs lost if your guild
can kill either of Tormax or Yelinax (GoDS/VEGs, neither of which you're
likely to get if you have epic), and that doesn't include STA/resist losses.
