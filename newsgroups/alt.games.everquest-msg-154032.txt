Oh please.

We are basing our reaction on Verants past record in "changing" things

Which negates all the time and work invested.  AA skills post nerf won't be
spent the same way as before..  if this nerf goes live, and its damning in
effect, I want all my AA levels back to try and at least make myself
semi-decent in verants "new" vision (vision? they dont have a fucking clue)

> OK. But you still have your defensive AA abilities, dont you?

People based their whole gearset around it, the change has massive
implications for people who put a lot of time and work into their character
