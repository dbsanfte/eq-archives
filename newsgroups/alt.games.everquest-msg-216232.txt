Well, I sent tells to a lot of the people on my list (which ended up being 
6 people, 5 of whom were on). I got 2 responses, the first from a guy who 
wanted 500pp to do the combine. Then Kastizi said she'd do it for free!

I gathered everything I thought I needed to get my Soulstone, and sent 
Kasti another tell. What luck, she'd just left HoHb and was in PoT! She 
came to PoK and met up with me, where I gave her enough stuff to do 2 
combines. She combined the first successfully- the second one 
unsuccessfully. Then she put the idol in the kiln with the HQ firing 
sheet... and nothing happened.

It turns out that the Soulstone recipe on eqtraders does not mention the 
glaze you need to add. Luckily she had one, so she glazed it off and gave 
it back to me. Now I just need to make another 3 yellows and I 

This whole time we had been talking about various stuff, and I guess I made 
a favorable impression. Out of the blue she said "Hang on, I think I have 
some cleric stuff rotting in the bank". Bonus!

She ended up giving me a nice shield (upgrade from my Charred Guardian to 
Battered Shield of Glory) and a great ring (from Circled Toe Bones to Ring 
of Dark Intellect- WOOT Spell Haste III!). She also tried to give me the 
same BP I bought 2 days ago(Kylong Darkmail Breastplate).

All in all, I got 3 kick ass items, a new friend, and I had a good time 
talking to them. Thanks for the suggestion!
