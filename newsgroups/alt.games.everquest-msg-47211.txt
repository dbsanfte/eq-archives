I ran it through copelands. Not knowing your stats for sure, I just gave
you a default STR of 150.

Combining the Lammy with the CSS at your level gives you a damage output
rating of 837 dmg/minute base.  Switching that over to dual Lammy gives
you a rating of 828. With neither having a proc, the difference looks
negligible to me. But I suppose the CSS will scratch out a small amount
more damage over a long fight, and more is better, so........
