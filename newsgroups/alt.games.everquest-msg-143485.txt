There are lots of answers to this, but in the end I'll have to go
with 51-60.  Most of the discussion in this newsgroup
centers around post 50 game, more than half of your exp for
a level 60 character goes into the post 50 game, even without
AA.  While you could make the same arguement for AA,
generally AA just isn't all that big a deal, its a gradual increase
in marginal capabilities that gives the 60 crowd something
to do other than accumulate better gear.

Soulbinders are a convenience, but all they really did was
reduce bind begging.  Unless you are a died in the wool
never ask for help never buy help never group with a caster
melee or hybrid, there's never been a need for the soulbinder,
they merely make things less of a hassle.

Speed looting, too, is  a convenience, but dragging your
body to a safe spot where you can loot at your lesiure is
rarely a problem, all this did for me was cut a minute per
death off my "ready to go" time.

If the game had remained 1 to 50, though, I'd have long
since made a 50 character in every class and given up
and moved on to the next MMRPG... 50 just doesn't take
that long!
