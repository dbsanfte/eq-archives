Gah -- I am an "H". WHEN ARE SERVERS BACK UP?!?!?!!?!

I check the NG when servers are down, or when at work, and boss is around. I
eat during zone times, take showers during the occasional boat trips, and do
grocery shopping during patch time. As far as going to the bathroom, well...
that's what catheters are for. I wrote a program that computes exactly how
many hours a week I MUST go to my job in order to survive and pay for my EQ
habits, and how few hours I can work without getting fired. I have affixed a
"Quarantine Area -- Do Not Enter" sign to my front door: this seriously cuts
down on the unintended visitors. I told my family that I was entering a cult
that did not allow me to communicate with family members until I had reached
"Complete Harmonic Balance", so I would not make phone calls for a while. I
sold the girlfriend, and broke up with the Golden Retriever, both were
taking up entirely too much "Leveling" time. Shaving takes up too much time,
and I don't want to use an electric razor and risk static electricity
damaging my EQ files. Since I now look like an undersized, extremely pale
Barbarian (Without Tattoos), I am not making friends. Due to my disturbing
habit of saying things like "WOOT!", "LOL", and "ROFLMAO!" aloud in public
my for RL friends have disappeared.

And that is just fine!
