Yes, this is true.  But its still both, because mana pool is only
important in emergencies, and in an emergency, its 10% more
pool.  Mana regen matters all the time, and its 10% better all
the time, too.  If you are casting 10%  more spells then no, you
don't med back 10% faster than using fewer spells, but you do med
110% mana back faster.

I don't mean to imply, though, that its actually 10% + 10%
better... because the 10% more pool part isn't nearly as
important in most situations, its perhaps 11% better.
