Its an excellent place to hunt. Our guild like to use it as a genral
grouping and hunting ground. I think we were raiding it on AB on Sunday
for over 12 hours.

Most loot in there for cash is actually armour pieces so might be annoying
for a monk...however there is a bank in there and unless you have been
rigorously hunting High Hold pass you should be reasonably OK to bank
there. Also the next door zone the Gorge is EXTREMELY useful for faction
reversal. Killing muddites and gorge minotaurs should be moderately
trivial for you and there is a merchant in EK nearby to sell to. Build up
pickclaw and runnyeye faction and away you go.
