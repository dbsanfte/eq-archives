Just built a new comptuer, and the music stutters.
I never had a problem with the sound on my old Celeron system.
(600@900Mhz)

Any thoghts as to what's going on?

New system Specs:

Soyo Dragan KT333 Ultra
Athon 1800+ cpu
Gigabyte AP64D (8500LE) video
512 meg samsung PC2700 dimm
Santa Cruz sound
Maxtor HD
USR hardware modem (but connecting through the onboard ethernet)
50X CD
Floppy
Windows XP pro

FSB @ 141Mhz.

Most recent drivers for all. Via 4-in-1's, RAID, video, sound, etc.
USB 2.0 enabled, and the drivers installed.
Onboard sound disabled.
Onboard ethernet enabled.
Primary HD on the RAID port. (secondary HD on the other RAID port)
CD rom on the main IDE port. (CDRW and ZIP to be added later)
I'm not using the RAID functionality.

It did the same thing, only worse, when using the onboard in c-media
sound.
Did a re-install of the OS, without loading the c-media drivers before
putting the tbsc sound card in.

Framerates don't seem to be affected, but I'll need to fire up FRAPS
to verify this.

Just for the record, I've also got a flicker in the video that is
really annoying. As though the refresh rate is too low, but it's there
are all rates and resolutions. Tried a retail 128Meg ATI 8500LE, and
it did the same thing.
The forums at Rage3D indicate that I'm not alone with this flicker
problem.

Overall, I'm not very happy with this new pc yet. Benchmarks are
better, but overall, it's not a $1000 improvement.
