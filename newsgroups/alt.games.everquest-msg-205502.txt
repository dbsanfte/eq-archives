Newbie alert!! (experienced players shield your eyes)

Hi all, I just started playing EQ (Stromm newbie server) last week and I'm
hopelessly addicted, although I've been soloing mostly. After creating my
Ranger I found myself up a tree in Kelethin, and proceeded to walk off the
platform to my death......and then my corpse died a second time, of
embarrasment. That must be a first, dying before you're regenerated again!!
Maybe someday I'll share my tale of "How I found the Freakin Lift!!!" Never
saw the damn things 'til days later heheh.I've started to collect the
ingredients to make a full set of Trueshot Armour, first piece should be
into the forge soon. After collecting numerous daggers, hatchets, spears and
swords and attempting to place them in my secondary weapon slot, I'm ready
to climb the castle walls out of frustration. So I'm stuck running around
sticking a torch in Orcs' faces and setting Bats wings on fire while
stabbing them to death with my short sword. Am I not sufficiently skilled or
leveled to use a second weapon? Is there a certain type of weapon that must
be used?  Is there a certain number of points that must be there in order
for me to use a second weapon? Also how do I use my bow? I know, I know,
dumb as a rock, but if ya didn't have newbies to give ya a chuckle life
would be boring.  I don't have any arrows yet, but I can't even place the
bow in my hand. Is that because the ammo slot is empty? Or am I still too
raw of a Ranger to use these?  Still have lots to learn about hp and ac I
know, but still...........It would be nice to see those Orc Centurions meet
their maker at a time of MY choosing hehehe. Any advice from a faithful
defender of Tunare, especially an Elven or Human Ranger would be greatly
appreciated. And I'm not looking for a mommy or a sugardaddy. I've gotten
killed from behind because I've been standing around playing with my
inventory trying to give myself two blades lol. Don't bother trying to group
with me though, I tend to go linkdead pretty often so I'd just be
disappearing and you'd have to fight off the Gnolls by yourself, it's not
worth your time or corpse.
