I've never tried mezzing a giant (my enchanters are cowardly teen-
level slackers), but I do know that you can stick a Stun to Forest
Giants because I've done it quite a few times.  Surprised me the
first time it happened (was using Stun to pull), afaik they are the
only stunnable giants in the game.  Oh, and the point of this is
that every stun-immune mob I know of is mez-immune and vice versa.
Not that I know every mob in the game, but I have used Stuns to
pull giants throughout Antonica/Kunark/Velious.
