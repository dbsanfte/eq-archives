: As an IT professional I stay on top of MS security holes. Most are
: Explorer/ISS related. Believe me, I stick with Linux/Apache web serving
: solutions. Free and 'relatively' secure. OE has few security issues (that
I
: know of), mainly because of its limited features (score one for DT!). The

displaying

: By 'vague' I mean to imply that people should be given either all the
: relevant facts or warned ahead of time that the views expressed are
: subjective and not a universal truth.
:
: Like top-posting. Yes it's a Usenet standard, but all forms of
communication
: are subject to change. Like many others here I have been using newsgroups
: for 10 years or more (man, I feel old), but have evolved with the times.
:
: I mainly understand that there are no standards when it comes to
: communication. One of the things I like about OE is that it actually
: encourages folks to use their newsfeeds. Many groups I used to frequent
are
: thinning out, victims of the 'Web Based Forum' plague! Maybe we can share
a
: hatred for those horrible, PITA, moderated, troll-bait blemishes on the
net!
:
: Knowest thou what I mean?

Or they are busy nowadays writing in their blogs (and who reads all of those
anyway?)

One point about security....Apache is not without it's holes but alot safer
than Microsoft servers (do you remember a few years ago when a get command
to Microsoft.com exposed the fact that they were using Solaris, lol!)
As for Explorer I recently had to install shockwave via Windows Update on an
old Win98 laptop (to run a CD) and there were 13 major security patches!!
'Course nothing compares to vulnerabilities of OE when it comes to worms and
virii.
