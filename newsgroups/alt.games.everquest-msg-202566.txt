From the patch message:

** Experience System Change - Grouping **

We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest.
These
improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping. After

this is a Massively Multiplayer game.

Grouping does both.  Provides less downtime, and reinforces SOE's objective.

I'm puzzled as to why you can't see that.
