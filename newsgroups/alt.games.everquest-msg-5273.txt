If it makes you feel better, here's a much worse story.  I saw the following
on Rodcet Nife.  Level 44 Pally was bound directly at the gates in Freeport.
I have no idea what happened to him originally, but he must have died at
some other location in the game as he popped up there naked.  Somehow he
messed up his faction because he then through various efforts to run to EC
proceeded to die 13 more times.  Bleh.  Plus all 4 people who attempted to
save him by giving sow or attempting to mez guards also died.  Finally, I
got him to run to North Freeport, made it on his first try.  Doh.  He drew a
large crowd watching him attempt running away, some in horror and some
laughing.  At the same time, newbies were complaining that all those guards
running about were killing their mobs.  Needless to say, this was a tragic
accident that you had to see to believe.
