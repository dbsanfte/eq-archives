And what exactly do the Druid group ports have to do with 
grouping? A Druid playing port whore is not exactly grouping, 
except, maybe, for the brief time the actual port takes. For that 
matter, KEI whores aren't generally grouping much either, except 
for the time it takes to cast the spell... So explain again how 
group ports or KEI make people group with you? The only kind of 
porting that gets me good groups is Evacs, and last time I 
checked, the PoK stones will not get you out of a world of shit 
at the bottom of Sebilis, for example.

I don't know about Enchanters, but Druids would love it.
