Speaking of lacking reading comprehension, go get your eyeglass cleaner,
put it to use, and then let's take another look at the very section of
my post which *you* quoted.

Hello? McFly? Is this on? As I stated, it was obvious that he wasn't on
*our* Vox raid. I was just stating that, fortunately, we didn't run into
problems with those kind of assholes and we all managed to get our
corpses and rez's in an orderly fashion. We may have run into a myriad
of *other* fucked up problems, but thankfully that wasn't one of them.

Not enough coffee yet, Rune?
