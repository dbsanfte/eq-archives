What class is your Ogre?

A shaman will never see an increase in the skill, and will not do more 
than 1 point of damage with it, even against a level 1 orc pawn when the 
shaman is level 65.  For a class that also gets the bash skill, you will 
get skillups in it, and the damage amount will indeed go up.
