  But for some people, those statements are absolutely true.

  Abandon them?  Verant knows as well as anyone that most of their
playerbase is "addicted" and has too much invested in EverQuest to
just walk away from the game easily.  All that time spent building
levels, acquiring loot.  All those friends, comrades and goals that
one would have to abandon to quit.  The fact is, that no matter how
abused a person might feel by Verant, they'll probably keep playing as
long as they can.  Verant is not ignorant of this fact.

  The situation is only compounded by the fact that Verant has no
truly strong competitors the MMORPG arena.
