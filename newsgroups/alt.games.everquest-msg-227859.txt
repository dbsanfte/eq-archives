Twink. Right.

Why not judge me sight unseen? You've already implicitly decided to
tell me what I "need" and that I must be greedy if I disagree.

You're right. She's a twink. In fact, after the cleric I'd played up
to level 65 and 68 AAs was stolen out from under me, my whole guild
twinked me to the gills so that I could get back into the swing of
things.

The thing that I find most irritating about the pro-NBG crowd is their
smug self-righteousness in the assumption that their way of doing
things is morally superior. You have done a remarkable job of
demonstrating that reprehensible trait.

FTR, the first two ornate bracers that I was wearing on my original
cleric were purchased with plat that I earned playing her. Every piece
of gear she wore was earned by her on raids, won in random rolls, or
purchased with plat she earned.

Now, having justified myself to you, I'd like to point out that I
didn't have to. But, I have this inexplicable faith in humanity that
says if you show the self-righteous and sancimonious that their
assumptions are wrong often enough, eventually they'll stop judging
people based on their assumptions and mind their own business.
