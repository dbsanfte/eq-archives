Dunno, a lot more than I used to thats for sure.  Keep hoping someone
with a more meticulous mind than I has already done this work.  Look
back in the newgroup history and you'll find the single thread with
actual numbers... but it didnt' give warrior numbers to compare
with, just general statements that claimed that warrior numbers were
lower.

We are looking at a pet that quad hits for up to 50 a pop,
plus MoR doing 15 each time mob hits something
plus cleric weilding a 14/18 weapon and running 25% haste
(oh, and plus 75 attack or so)
plus frequent procs of up to 150 dd (rarely if ever resisted)
(more frequent because weapon has +25 dex and yaulp V has
another plus 75 dex)
plus pet has a dd stun proc I don't have a number for
Plus Bash damage, which I don't have maxed out at all,
I'm hitting for another 36 points or so when I hit at all.

On the down side, clerics have a weapon skill cap of 175
and no dual attack at all, so even with the attack boost we
still hit less often, and swing less often than a comperable
level warrior... unless you add our swings to the pet swings,
in which case you are staring down the barrel of roughly
comperable swing rate (4 per 3 seconds, and another one
per what, 1.2 seconds, plus the bash every 3 seconds? for
7 blows every 3 seconds more or less)

Oh, and I have a 21% haste item on, but I don't think the
original melee parse had that figured in, no idea what
he might have been wearing by way of haste, anywhere from
none at all to 41%, I suppose.
