Sure, sure, but that part wasn't my point.  The fact that not only did 
physical scale change, but the time scale did as well at the same time 
is closer to my point, but my real point came later, which was that the 
combat mechanics of the game were based on units which were

I must have played a thousand PnP games of various sorts, an avid gamer 
who eventually opened and ran a game store for several years.  Generally 
the most enjoyable games tended to ignore all the fiddly details like 
this, but I played quite a few where we stuck close to the rules for 
combat and other tight situations.

At any rate, while EQ (and some PnP) games are played in "real time", 
tabletop games tend to be turn based, mechanically speaking.  Thus, a 
combat that took 3 minutes in game time might take 1 minute or a half 
hour in real world time.  The fact that that "three minutes" was the 
length of the combat outdoors yet the very same combat on an "indoor" 
map would have instead taken "30 seconds" is the part I'm interested in 
for the purposes of this discussion.

And even more interesting, the fact that if the area covered happened to 
be, say, a large sandy area with no walls or cliffs or anything, it 
would be impossible to tell whether the combat had taken place in a vast 
sandy pit "indoors" or in a large sandy arena "outdoors".

Now that you remind me, there was a third scale, the "big map" scale, 
where you were looking at hexes per day (changing from a grid to a hex 
map just for the fun of it) crossing large distances, but that wasn't a 
combat scale, you didn't, for example, see your arrows suddenly flying 
45 days walk in a single (day long) turn.

Aha, but my point was that in those D&D terms, it would be about inches. 
  Outdoor inches represented one distance per inch, indoor inches 
another distance per inch, but your movement rate was measured in inches 
per combat round, your archery range was measured in inches of distance, 
so on and so forth.

Say you drive across Colorado in a day, and across Rhode Island in three 
hours, but we scale the time as well so that both take one "turn"

Right.  Unfortunately, the D&D workaround for that was to have different 
time scales as well, but that doesn't fly in a MM game, where we have 
some people outdoors and some indoors, at the same time, who can be in 
constant real time communication with each other; there'd be a time 
dilation effect!  ***

I'm not following you here, somehow.  I don't really remember specifics 
too clearly, but I think an inch was ten feet indoors and ten yards 
outdoors, so that 30x30 grid represented 300 feet by 300 feet, which 
would be a pretty good sized house indeed (and 30x30 is big enough for 
some decent running around room, even broken up into rooms and hallways)

Outdoors that same building would suck up a 10x10 space on your map 
which might also be 30x30, or 50x50 or whatever; it would still be the 
same 300 foot by 300 foot edifice, it just wouldn't take up so much 
space, which is handy because its not so interesting from the outside.

You -think- its universal, but I'm suggesting that perhaps it isn't. 
The whole reason I brought up the D&D indoor outdoor issue was because 
there we see an example of a setup where the same "unit" (the inch) 
explicitly represented two different scales, yet was still treated as if 
it made sense to have unit ranges be the same in both cases.

Trouble with my whole metaphor is that as I note above (with the ***) it 
only really works if you are soloing or you have a single party that 
cooperates by moving onto the same map at all times.  In a Massively 
Multiplayer game, the whole thing breaks down because we all stick to 
the same time scale all the time, the only alternative would be if, as 
you suggest, that people's strides actually vary in size from one zone 
to the next.

I suspect it won't ever really work out right, that the "fudge factor" 
is really whats being used, (hey, ever play the Fudge system?  Me 
either, but it was fun to look at)  but its fun to think about.
