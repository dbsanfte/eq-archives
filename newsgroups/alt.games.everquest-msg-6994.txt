Just stopped by the bank in Erudin tonight, and found a new NPC standing
outside the bank door....
His name is Sparlus Penfold, and he sells but one item...the latest edition
of the Odus Chronicle.  Cost my Erudite Paladin 2sp, 8cp.  It is No Rent.

Inside were some good summaries of what's been going on lately with the
Plaguebringers, the plague in the Karanas Plains, and rumors about the
latest actions of Innoruk's daughter.

Kudos to Verant for finding a way to provide info in-game on what's been
going on lately.
