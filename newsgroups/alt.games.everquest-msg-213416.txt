Green background spells can usually hit 4+1 targets. Specifically, 4 mobs, +
you.
Rains are useless for kiting, they do damage in waves, centered on the spot
you first cast.
Harmony, Wake of Tranquility, and the AE Memblur (not mez) will hit as many
targets as you can fit in their Area of effect

There's also Al'kabor (or something) spells. Supposedly larger aoe, can hit
5 instead of 4 targets, most wizards call them al'crapbore spells.

blue backgroud ae's are point blank, centered on you, but hit whatever you
can pack into the area of effect. That's what 'ae' groups use (pull 30 mobs,
enchanters use pbae stuns, wizzies use pbae damage)
