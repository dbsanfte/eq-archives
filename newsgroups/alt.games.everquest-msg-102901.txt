Well, I just invised myself and wandered through Freeport regular way.
I hear some mobs in the city see through invis, but haven't met any.
Just went straight to Fondl, talked to him (you're not KOS to him and
nothing else is down there). He walks off, stops, cancelled invis (bad
spot there .. a guard might see you I think), did the blah thing,
reinvised, followed him to pub up to chamber, uninvised, talked to
spirit. Invis alone does it all, no need to get funky :)
