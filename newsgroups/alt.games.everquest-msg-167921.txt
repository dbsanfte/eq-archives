My opinion is that, on the FV server, the language barrier issue
is a failed experiment.  If anything, it REDUCES the amount of
role playing, is a non-trivial annoyance, and just forces people
to go through pointless and grueling "language learning" sessions.

I'm baffled why SOE leaves the language barrier thing in on the FV
server.

In any case, just go through that pointless and grueling "language
learning" sessions with some players of other races.  It'll be a
huge waste of several hours of your life, but it'll leave you able
to communicate with most everyone.
