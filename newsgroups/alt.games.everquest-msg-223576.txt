The elemental planes are not level based, they are based on what you have
raided and killed.

In order to get Elemental Flagged, you have to kill or quest the following
things.. (I'll probably forget some, but..)

Plane of Justice Trials (single group)
Manetic Behemoth (Raid)
Aren'dar (dragon - raid)
Grummus (Raid)
Carpin cycle (raid)
Bertoxx (God - Raid)
Plane of Nightmare Hedge raid (3 group mini-raid)
Terris Thule (Goddess - Raid)
Bastion of Thunder Key quest  (Quest - 1 to 2 groups)
Agnarr the Storm Lord (raid)
Saryn (Goddess - Raid)
Halls of Honor trials A, B and C.  (Raid - Trial C is a nasty dragon.)
Lord Mithanniel Marr (God - Raid)
Tallon Zek (God - Raid)
Vallon Zek (God - Raid)
Rallos Zek the Warlord (God - Raid)

Anything marked raid generally requires 30 - 72 level 65 people all working
together.   And even then they're not easy, unless you're well equipped and
experienced in raiding.
