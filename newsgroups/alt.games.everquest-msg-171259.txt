: What's the best way to move EQ to the new system?
:

Just install the programs on thje new system.  If you want your log files or
coustom UI you will need to copy them and transfer them.

Don't just copy the files from one drive to another.  Some programs don't
keep alll there files together in the same directory..  I haven't looked at
the install report for EQ, but knowing Sony they probably puty one important
file in another directory, or a reference in you Registry.  Always best to
just install it on the new system then patch.  That way everything is in one
nice block..  (Fast load times)

As for what to copy over.  Everything in ..\Sony\Everquest\uifiles  If you
use a coustom Interface.
Also copy anything with your toon's name in it IE.  ( eqlog_toon name_server
number.txt,  Toon name_server number.ini,  UI_toon name_server number.ini )

Hope this info helps.  And Congrats on the new machine..  Can i have your
old one ;-)
