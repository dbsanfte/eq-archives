Hi !

I don't post here very often, and I haven't played EQ all that long
but I have a question that I need some opinions on. I have a level 15
cleric (high elf) as my main character, and I really enjoy plaing him
- but sometimes I would like to play solo, and the cleric (in my
experience) works better in groups.

So, which is the better solo class? I am basically looking for a
character that will be able to go through large areas of the game with
needing a group and one that will be fun to play.

I was thinking about playing a necromancer, both since they are loners
in the first place and it would be a nice change from my good
cleric...

So. Necromancer - any good?? Or should I play another class?

Any feedback would be appreciated
