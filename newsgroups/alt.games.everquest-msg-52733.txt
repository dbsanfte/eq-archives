    Not pointless, but IS annoying due to the way binds work. My rogue won't
fight in Seb, only Velk's, because I don't want the massive run back in case
of death. They could up the difficulty of Velk's until it was as challenging
as any other zone in that level range, and I'd still hunt there over Seb as
long as I could get a pickup group there JUST because of the binding issue.

    Another area where DAoC players are really having fun. The low downtime
sounds like a hoot.

    Bah, with how few people are on the server I bet they get more
complaints about how uber_helm05 looks than the bind issue on FV. Which is
too bad - as much as they insist otherwise, the melee binding issue needs to
be revisited and changed.
