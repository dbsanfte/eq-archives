I think its just your imagination in Velious, at least I never noticed this
effect nor have I heard about it.

However, you are not imagining things about the desert; certain zones (Oasis
comes to mind) cause you to become thirsty twice as fast as usual.

If you buy a stack of Rations and a stack of Water, in most zones you will see
the two empty out at the same rate.  In Oasis, you'll be out of water and still
have 10 Rations left.

Luckily in the Oasis, the Madmen drop water very often, so if you keep the
madman population trimmed back you should never go thirsty.  On Morel Thule, we
call them Waterboys.
