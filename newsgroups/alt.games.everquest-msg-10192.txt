Part of it is a shadow knight thing... and I suspect part of it is
that you haven't quite figured out who you want to be friends with in
the game. most things have a faction hit associated and it's up to you
to work out which hits you want to worry about - and those are usually
associated with cities.

If the frogs are already kos to you, either avoid Guk till you can go
to lower Guk and kill myriads of dead frogs, or wait a couple levels
and have a ball in upper Guk. It's not like they're a city you could
use or anything, the only advantage is not getting aggroed in upper
Guk if you never killed as much as a tadpole.

Neriak? Don't know how a human SK would fare there even without
killing guards, but either kill halflings (mm, toelings!) or try to
get in to do the wine quest. Kill halflings first. Don't know how
you'd fare in Overthere outpost, I don't think it has any of the
regular DE factions.

Basically, if you want someone to not like you, kill their guards...
so be careful about which guards you kill. A shadow knight shouldn't
have much use for Rivervale so losing halfling faction to get DE
faction shouldn't bother you too much. 

Other factions aside from the city based which you might consider: try
to con one of the WC druids at the ring. You are probably KOS... if
you want to TRY to amend that, kill unkempt druids in Rathe mountains.
If you don't want to bother with it, kill treants and further hose
your druid ring faction. 

Hey, you're a shadow knight... why go with the lesser evil? :)
