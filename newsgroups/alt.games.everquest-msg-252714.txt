Xnews will do special things if the quote character is a >. It will color 
quotes specially, including making nested quotes a different color (user 
configurable). When replying to a post with quotes it will automatically 
reformat the post when the lines get too long or screwed up. So there are 
some advantages for Xnews users if the "quote standard" is a >.
