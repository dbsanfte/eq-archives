How many times do I have to correct this?  The "kid" in question was a 
grown man.  He was NOT in any defination a "kid".  One of my pet peeves 
now is everyone calling that man a kid.  He was old enough to make his 
own decisions, he was old enough to live on his own and did live in his 
own apartment, paid for by his own job.  His mother is an idiotic 
controlling bitch, she's just upset he didn't listen to his mommy and 
stay locked in her basement.  If she was so concerned about his net 
addiction, she could have gone to social services and the local courts 
and gotten him declared incompetent.  Instead, she's shaking her fists 
at Sony.   Sony had nothing to do with it.  If he hadn't been playing 
EQ, it would have been a myriad of other games.  That guy was a hardcore 
gamer.  Nothing would have kept him off the net.

I'm sorry if some of my language is upsetting, this subject gets me a 
little peeved.
