I would have ignored the guild warrior and instead:

/g "Hey Bard, what have you been telling your guild? I have some warrior
from your guild telling me to quit complaining about aggro management..."

But I think Breathe handled it better, he cooled the situation down rather
than inflamed it. Unfortunately that had the side effect of letting the bard
get away with talking smack uncorrected - but that is the price you pay for
diplomacy I guess.
