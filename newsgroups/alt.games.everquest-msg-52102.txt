Well, my guild board had info about it posted at 3:43am on the 21st,
so we had at least 48 hours notice.  And if I hadn't finally given up
on the PoM insertion last night I'd be waiting for servers to come up
with a lot less patience than I normally have.  I think one of the
spoiler sites had some info too, but can't remember which one right
now.
