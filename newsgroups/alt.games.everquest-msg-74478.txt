I see people making this mistake a lot. Lv 50 is not a hell level. I don't
have the wizzy chart handy, but will illustrate with the human monk chart.

At lv 49  you need 11,855,760 exp points to get to 50
At lv 50 - 12,349,680 to get  51
           here it gets bad
At lv 51 -28,771,800 to get to 52

every lv from 51 to 60 is considered a hell lv with 54 and 59 taking big
jumps from the previously insane amounts already needed.
53 needs ~ 33million
54 needs ~ 55million
58 needs ~ 76million
59 needs ~ 107million  :(

I just finished lv 51, and as awfull as it was, whats really depressing is
it was the easiest of them.
