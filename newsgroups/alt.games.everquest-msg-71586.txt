	Anyone can make a Trueshot, though only Rangers can equip one.    The only
real advantage to the Trueshot was that it was cheaper to attempt than a
Shaped Darkwood Compound and nearly as good.  There are very few Ranger only
bows in the game, and the best bow I know of (Primal) is not Ranger only.  I
currently use a Bow of the Underfoot (for the stats and for general sniping)
or a Bow of the Huntsman (for serious Archery work), and neither of them is
Ranger only.

	For a very brief time, a bow nearly as good as the Primal was a secondary
reward in the Coldain Insignia Ring Quest...and it was ROGUE only.  Rangers
were Not Amused.
