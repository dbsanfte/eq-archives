Any text I put here is bottom posting.  This is the mostly accepted norm for
usenet.  By no means does everyone agree with it, but probably the majority
of posters do.  Other things to consider, snip out text that is not relevant
to what you are replying to.  It is acceptable to reply in line,
particularly if you have several different points to address, then you put
your response immediately under the relevant text within the message you are
replying to.
