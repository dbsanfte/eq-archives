Can you concede the point that *I* might feel the same way??

I have already been labled as a bigot, an idiot and much more from
your side of the fence..

Don't you think that what you state you feel above may apply to
someone else??  Maybe even to me??

You claim I don't know you and therefore I have no right to make such
judgements.  That VERY same idea was expressed to you, RS and BS by me
and was totally disregarded.

So, please explain to me how on the one hand, I cannot know anything
about you, yet you, RS and BS know ALL about me, or at least enough
about me to label me as you have...

I look forward to your sincere, adult and mature response.
