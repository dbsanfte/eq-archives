 It's been a while, but I seem to remember when I started in April
1999 taking what was called a "warrior port" - store stuff in a bank
and drown to port back to bind with ZERO exp loss.
 Could be I'm mis-remembering though. Exp loss on drowning was added
about the same time Class penalties were mathed away.
