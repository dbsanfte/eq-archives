    It shouldn't be hard to make loot that's better, but not massively
mudflated. Especially in this day of mods and foci.

    Kunark dragons, etc. all still drop items that sell for a great deal in
The Bazaar. That cash can buy items that one wants which are power
level-appropriate, like ornate molds or elemental tradeskill items. As long
as the droppables from previous expansions are of high quality, people will
continue to go there for that reason alone. A small guild group still goes
to Veeshan's Peak. =/
