    That's a feature, sadly. Not that it matters - DI won't save someone
that gets one-rounded, and the next generation of mobs will one-round people
quite nicely I'm sure.

    Healing sure has evolved from the original game. In the original game,
heals were done on people that were hurt. You healed damage already done.
Then, with higher HP totals, people started using CH. With CH, you're timing
the spell to heal a maximal amount of damage that has not yet landed on the
character - you're healing expected future damage. Then you come to some of
the top mobs in the raiding game, which cannot one-round your tank but which
can two-round them with ease. There, you're trying to land a full heal after
every possible swing the mob has (hint, Monual, hint with that problem your
guild has now). So you're now healing potential damage. The CH chain
functions like one continuous DI - a blow lands, a CH heals it all back no
matter how much it was for. It makes me sad to see how little actual healing
I do sometimes in a CH chain. :-(
