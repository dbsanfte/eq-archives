    If you don't have a successful Taunt within two tries, don't bother
waiting. The group is going to start to wonder if you even bothered to train
it. A stun on a mezzed mob does add hate - that's why you do it, to vault
that much higher than the ENC on the hate list so they can sit. Number two
is a nice break as well, but I just don't trust root. I don't think any
caster that's had to root-nuke to solo does. ;-)

    Actually, it wasn't meant as a crack at paladins. Most of what they're
expected to do is covered by those comments. Here's how to gain aggro, how
to break a mez, how to solo the average mob, how to use LoH. That covers a
lot of a paladin's arsenal.

    Healing Wave of Prexus is great for getting aggro, and is fast enough
that it's a good spell to cast if casters have aggro. Either you'll get
aggro back, or you'll have healed the caster and have a chance to stun to
regain control. Consider it an AoE taunt in a fight with adds, and plan to
get beat on.
