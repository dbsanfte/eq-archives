None taken.  The broken/inconcistant rules of language are one of my
pet-peeves.  So is the guy who passes you on the freeway just to pull in
front of you and slow down to take an exit.  The latter is dangerous and
something needs to be done about it.  The former is, at its worst, just
an inconvienience.  I don't let it get to me. (Not much anyway.) I have
too many other things on my plate to spend much time on that one.

Language belongs to the people, so who am I to try to stop them from
making what they want of it.  I couldn't do much about it any way and
few really give a hoot what I think.  (That looks like I don't think
much of myself, but I do.  I understand the 'sleeping with a mesquito'
proverb.)  I'll be satisfied to suck a little blood and then move on
before I'm slapped.
