You can't run it 'Full screen' on two monitors (directX fullscreen 
doesn't support multimonitor), but you can certainly put it in a window 
on one or the other. Or you can run 2 instances on two monitors. I don't 
know if EQ is fancy enough to let you re-geometry the screen though (I 
saw a Doom 3 game being run in a full desktop sized window spread across 
3 screens.. was most impressive looking in the pictures.) If you can do 
that however, it would let you run eq on two monitors quite nicely. (If 
you could do that I could see using the viewport command to put the 
window on one screen, all your ui stuff on the other)
