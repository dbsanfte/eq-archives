Which helps protect you against incedental larceny from the
basically honest but easily tempted.

Anyone who's actually planning to rip you off will simply look
ahead at the possible drops in a camp and bring along dummy items
to wear in those spots, usually only one or two of them, which
won't be crippling to not wear for one camp.

And further, as I pointed out elsewhere, simply looking to see if
anything at all drops where you are going thats of interest to
them, and Not Going to camps that don't have gear they want, is
another way of ripping you off subtly; yes, they can show you the
item they are upgrading with all honesty.  But oddly, you don't
see them at those camps where things may drop for your class but
not for theirs.

And the way EQ camps tend to work, any given camp often has items
of interest to at best half the classes in the game.

This also happens on a raid level, where for example Clerics have
practically no reason to go to Fear but lots of reason to go to
Hate.  Its the reason guilds tend to set up complex reward
schemes, so that they Can get clerics for Fear, and yet reward
them later with first pick of the cleric drops in Hate.

Not a fantastic example, with many guilds now bypassing the early
planes entirely, but its what came to mind from back when I was
first banging my head against NBG and early raiding.
