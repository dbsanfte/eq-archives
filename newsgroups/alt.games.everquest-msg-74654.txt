VI does nothing to fix bugs unless they get bitch fit-yelled at by the
player base.   I have /bug'd, Many times actually.   I have also /pet'd and
had it witnessed for low scores.

If more rangers here till me they see it too, and we all bug within a
shorter timeframe.. maybe VI will actually look into it.  With the new ALT
point archery changes, I actually feel VI nerfed higher end bows simply due
to the fact that most people are gimps with WindSabers and the like, and VI
wants to give them a warm cushy feeling that a 120 is a nice hit.


But I digress.
