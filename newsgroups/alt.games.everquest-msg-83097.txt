Wait a second...if you hypothosize a mob jumping them before they
finished camping, then you must also consider the possibility that
after they got killed, they stood around at their bind point for
several hours, until they got disconnected by random packet loss or
the next patch.  Standing around overnight would cut the offline time
down to under four days for corpse decay.
