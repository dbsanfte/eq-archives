 No more pickpocketed fungis. Or rather, no more "What the hell, King
dropped no loot??".

 Tinkering is one of the most useful things Verant has ever added.

 Yay.

 Good change I guess. Conceivable that raids such as Emperor usually
have more than 60 people.

 This could conceivably be a good change. Dare I say it would make 7-9
person 'groups' viable means of XP gathering? It would be nice.

 About time.

 Well this is nice information. Not that it's hard to figure out which
ones they change, but it's nice telling you up front.

 Looks like they finally put the revamped Skyshrine onto live servers.
I'm guessing more of the ST quests will finally be figured out now that
you have someplace to turn your items into.
