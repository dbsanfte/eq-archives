Beastlords do not seem to get any bonus to their AC as monks do,
if they wish to add in an AC bonus for low weight totals which
is present to a lesser extent as weight increases, this wouldn't be
a nerf, but a positive enhancement.

At the moment, nerfing the class seems like a foolish thing
to do, as we are finding that it simply has no function at the
high end of the game.

One hope that we were still clinging to is that the high end
slow (Sha's Lethargy?) would stack with shaman slow...
but no, it doesn't and isn't as good.  As you only want one
slower in a raid sized force, one or two shaman are wanted
for a force of 20+... and no need for someone with a less
effective slow.

My only remaining thought would be that several beastlords
could chain summon their pets without buffing them, using
this mana free supply of melee to eventually sandpaper
a melee vulnerable mob to death  without risk.
