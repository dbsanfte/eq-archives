The main result of these locked zones is that guilds are being torn apart. 
I've lost count of how many guilds I've been in that have died because of a 
constant leeching of players to higher end guilds.  Yes, it has to do alot 
with people simply using the guild with intent to jump ship as soon as they 
can, but that mentality is fostered by Sony for making content that can't 
easily be accessed.  If you can't survive in a zone, let the mobs in that 
zone kill you repeatedly until you decide you need to step down and increase 
your power before coming back.  I want the mechanics of the game to 
determine where I can and can't go, not some accountant in a cubilce at 
Sony's corporate office.

What is the total population of EQ these days?  Lets estimate high and say 
there are still a million people playing EQ.  How many people have gotten 
into the Demi-plane of Blood?  Maybe 7,000-8,000 people?  I believe that 
just a miniscule fraction of EQ subscribers have seen that zone, and I 
believe the reason is that people can't gear up because they are constantly 
crashing into walls put in place by Sony developers.

Insteand of yet another new expansion full of locked zones, how about Sony 
start to open up content that already exists by removing the stupid keys and 
flags required to enter them?  They can make money by firing the developers 
who design these stupid things in the first place.
