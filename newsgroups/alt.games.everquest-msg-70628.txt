I bring my wife to the USA next month.  I know all about the wonderful (read
useless) INS.  I was just givving some of many possible reasons.

Not worried about it.  Just an observation.  I stand by it.  Do what you
want.  It's not going to make one bit of difference to me what you end up
doing.

Read the part about nobody knowing your situation, again.  This has nothing
to do with you.  It's just personal ramblings based on others conjectures.
It's kind of like dreaming about winning the lottery only 10 times more

likely is to divide by 10, hmmm.  Not bleeding likely)
