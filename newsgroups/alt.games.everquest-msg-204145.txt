I haven't used it much but I think it's a nice addition to the camera 
angles already available. With my mouse (MS IntelliMouse Optical) if I 
roll the wheel faster it will accelerate the amount that it scrolls, so 
I can just do one finger motion downward on the wheel and it will zoom 
all the way out.

I wish I could bind my mouse3, mouse4 and mouse5 within EQ.
