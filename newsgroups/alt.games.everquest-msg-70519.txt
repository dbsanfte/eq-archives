Your argument is all well & good...if it was anyone else's fault than
Verant's that they decided to use a DX (whether by accident or on
purpose...it makes no difference) that doesn't support Win95.

But they DID decide to use a DX that doesn't support Win95 and they DID NOT
tell people until after the people found out for themselves.

Verant fucked up, pure and simple.  I tend to give them the benefit of the
doubt and I will this time too...I don't think it was intentional.  BUT THEY
ARE STILL THE ONES RESPONSIBLE.  THEY fucked up.  THEY either didn't bother
to read the SDK or ignore it.

Their reaction to THEIR fuck up is "bite me, asshole."
