Umm, it should be for tradeskills.

Spend 10 years as a blacksmith, and then you'll find that it takes nearly as
long to make a horseshoe as it did when you'd only spent 2 years as a
blacksmith.  Metal takes a certain amount of time to heat, glue takes a
certain amount of time to set, and all the skill in the world won't
seriously affect the time it takes to get "straw yellow" along the edge of a
blade.
