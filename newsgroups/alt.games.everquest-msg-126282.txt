/petition sends it a strained customer service worker who,
in the big picture, probably doesn't care that much. /bug
sends it to the designers and bosses who have the power to
change the zone, or make it a priority for customer service
to enforce. I would make sure to do both, or at least /bug
instead of /petition.
