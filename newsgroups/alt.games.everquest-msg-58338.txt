Halfling druids can certainly buy there... or almost anywhere
else in Norrath, with a little care.  Camo to get in position,
Sneak to keep safe and indifferent while buying.

Only places this doesn't work are where there are guards or other
NPCs which might object facing the spot where you would be
standing sneaking.  Even this is often easily overcome by pulling the
interlopers off to the zone, then beating them back to the target
vendor.

Its also possible to port in to places where you are KOS, just
have someone start casting invis on you, then start your port,
the invis will go off long before your port cast completes, and
you arrive invisible.  The person doing the invis must be
either not KOS, willing to disband before porting, or casting
a group invis that will therefore hit herself... but it can be done.
