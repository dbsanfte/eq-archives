From what I can see, all the female characters have "standard issue* breasts.
They seem to come from the same mold, scaled for the character's size.
Out of proportion?  Hell yes.  But it is a [male] fantasy game, after all.

From the graphic designer's perspective, I guess that's better than designing
12 different breast models.
