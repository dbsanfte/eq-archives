Skirt-boy, I have *never* in my life encountered a bigger, double-talking
coward than you. Your level of yellow has given me a new sense of how scared
someone can get when faced with being called on his own words.

I offered to fax you a copy of my passport and a release form. All you did
was dance around the issue. Somehow, my not having a scanner was your
"way out".

Having this info above, you would have *my* information first. All I asked
is that you fill in your information on the release so that I protect myself
legally from giving you what you believe I was not ready to do.

Sounds to me like you bit off more than you can chew and you're now too
scared to face the facts.

Keep on spinning, Rambo. In the end, the only thing you have to comfort
yourself with is your version of a spun reality in Usenet. You have no
dignity, no courage and must look at yourself in the mirror every morning
and see nothing but a worthless coward staring back.

No point in talking to you in IRC, either. All you do is ignore what's being
said and just fill the screen with "BWAAHAHAHAHAAAHAAHAAHAA" to drown out
what you don't want to acknowledge or respond to.

You don't have the balls to follow through on anything you say, tough guy.

Keyboard Rambo is all you have and all you will ever be.
