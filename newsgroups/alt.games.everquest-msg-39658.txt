I have had intermittent problems Alt-tabbing, yes.  I have only attempted it
3 times and succeeded once, fully.

- Keep task manager up so that you can alt-tab to IT.

- Alt-esc, alt-space, window-key or whatever u have to do to get the mouse
working once back out in Win2k.

- Keep the OS optimized.  Aside from t.manager (and maybe your browser,
which would be a popular reason for alt-tabbing) keep EQ-only running.

G'Luck,

-Grim
