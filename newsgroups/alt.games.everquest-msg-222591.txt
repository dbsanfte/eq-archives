	The whole time I've been right clicking them to get a con.
IMHO the first symptom of the creaping featurism that is the absolute
death of even a good UI is the addition of features to make trivial
things easier.  Rather than add Yet Another (cluttering) Feature they
could have fixed a real bug and just added a note in the MOTD about
right clicking to get a con.

	So my whine may have been unclearly targeted (how's that for
irony? :-) but the point I'm trying to make is that this seems to me
to be nothing but featurism, a Bad Thing.  Great Ghu, why not just *leave*
the UI untouched and *fix* the whole con thing so that when something cons
lt blue it *is* lt blue (thinking of say Kizdean Gix...)
