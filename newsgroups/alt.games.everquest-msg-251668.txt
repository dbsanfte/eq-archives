Yes, they raised the damage to the point where its just as mana 
efficient as the firebolt.  BUT since the firebolt is same efficiency

I'd want to use something smaller.

But in a raid, won't you normally have at least one wizard, capable of 
casting TL to bind with no reagent cost at all?

I thought not, but could have been surprised, could be the 63 version 
was like the old sub 50 ones, not a caster, for example.  I loved that
