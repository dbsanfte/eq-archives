Uh..  what?

Shamans have a buff like that no other hp line is based on (ie it stacks
with everything except clerics mana regen)

Shamans have the best stat buffs and Poison/Disease resists (stacks with
necro dmf)... note "best stat buffs" is what I use to refer to the CRUCIAL
stats..  the ones that effect hitpoints.  I think they gave bsts some low
level +sta buffs, but shamans still posess the best by far.

Torpors is a fantastic heal/mana ratio spell.  Krags (1.9k heal 10second
cast) is ok.. Tnargs (1.2k heal 3.x cast) is good. Theres a new cheal too

Malo is an unresistable buff (like tash) that is crucial in debuffing mobs.

Shamans have the best slows (magic and disease based) of any class.

They have all the usual spells.. sow, regen, invis, levi etc.

Sorry.. but shamans are godly on raids.

No they don't have low HP.  Sure they are a group dependent class (just like
most melees)
