5 days? That is simply unacceptable.

Forget email. Call them. Get someone live. They aren't the brightest
people on the planet on the phone but they *can* get someone to take
action.

A more likely effort would be to get on sometime in the morning when
the tech support room is almost empty. If you can get a tech gm, they
can do a lot to help. You just have to be able to get one's attention,
and in the afternoon that is nigh impossible....

Which error is 1017? Is that the one that says your character is still
logged in? Forgive my ignorance, it has been a very long time since I
had any errors logging in.
