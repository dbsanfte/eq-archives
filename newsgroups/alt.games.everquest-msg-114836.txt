Hmmmm...HMMmmmm...thanks!  Maybe get a bard up to 11 or enchanter up to 12
(I think)...I wonder if they can go from Threatening to Dubious.  The only
way I can do that with my main (57 enc) is with illusion.  Well, probably
will go with Bard then...I have a 27 with full lambent I'm sure he won't
mind lending out for a week.
