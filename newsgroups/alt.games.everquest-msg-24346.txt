I gave up on LOIO yesterday - too hard to find a group and the friends I 
had who nagged me to go there to group with them are on for only about an 
hour of time that I'm on.  I decided to head back to Antonica and play 
bread-run again.  HOWEVER... I went into a little building in the middle 
of the Maiden's Voyage.  I sat down and meditated.  We zoned.  I got up 
to go look for the shuttles and... couldn't see.  Dangit!  I groped my 
way around the boat, couldn't find the shuttles, and ended up back in FV 
again.  Thank goodness it's a short trip.  We were off again after a long 
time (why does docking and leaving take longer than the ride itself? :p) 
and this time it was light enough to see.  So, I went into the building 
in the middle, sat down to med, and we zoned into TD again.  And... I 
stood up to walk out and couldn't get out.  It was a doorless entryway 
and very big, so my size wasn't the problem.  I'd been in and out several 
times exploring the boat before.  I tried jumping out the windows but 
that was hopeless.  I tried jumping and ducking through the doorway.  
Nothing.  It was like an invisible wall was build across the door.  I 
finally gave up and camped to the character selection screen, then came 
back in and ... I was on some island.  In Timorous Deep.  CRUD.  I yelled 
to find help but nobody did so I wandered around (the island had a 
walking parrot and had a chessboard on it, if that gives you any clue - I 
STILL do not know.  Seemed deserted except for that one parrot and some 
guy called Farseer or Farsight or something on it) and finally gated back 
to LOIO and did that horrible run through the drachnids AGAIN to get to 
FV and at that point, I offered 80 plat and got a port straight to the 
commons :p  ANYway.  Before I /bug this, I was wondering if anyone else 
has experienced it, or if they know if it *is* a bug or not.
