Perhaps a hotbutton.  I've tried to make it clear that I am twinked out, in fact
a post later tonight will list the degree of twinking going on (not a list of
equipment, just added stats) so people can get an idea where this is coming
from.

But I think you may be oversensitive to this sort of post, which generally comes
from observing high end shamans (level 60+) singling raid level targets in the
pre POP world.  I guess adding that level 20 shaman can take on targets that
might scare a full group of level 25's in newbie armor could contribute to that
fear.  I'll comment then that most of my equipment came from my froglok warrior,
who happily soloed his way to 30 much the same route.  The shaman is a better
soloer, but doesn't contribute as much DPS in a group.

Yep, I've been doing this happily in MS today, KEI free and having no problems.
