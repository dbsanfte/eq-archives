OK.

I know everyone is waiting for my top-posting butt to throw in an opinion,
so here goes:

1. I started a Druid as my first character. I did not 'want my cake and eat
it too'. I didn't evn know there was cake. I had just finished reading a
fictionalized novel about King Arthur and I like the Merlin character who
was a dirty, filthy, crazy Druid. In RL I'm a vegetarian and animal-rights
activist so I thought I'd fit

2. I have never had a problem getting EXP groups. In fact, I get invited
into groups constantly from strangers to whom I had given free ports/buffs.
Groups seem to appreciate the DS, Chloro, Girdle of Karana, roots and
snares. I let the Cleric in the group know I will be watching his back for
heals on the casters - Chloroblast and Sup Heal are excellent for keeping
those folks with low AC/HP alive while the Melee gets back aggro. And
healing the Cleric when he's getting beaten up and can't cast is always a
god thing.

3. My role on Raids is simple. Get everyone there (SoE and Foliage
Shield....mmmmm), get everyone out (Yes Wizzies can do this too, but often
getting all Raiders out simultaneously is essential, Chardok and DN come to
mind).

On the raid I make it my primary role to keep the Chanters and Clerics
alive. If a Mage isn't around I keep a DS on the pull group. I also keep
Regrowth on the pullers and SoW, SoE where needed. Yes Shamans can do this,
but in a Raid environment the Shamans are so busy Buffing/Slowing they
appreciate the help. If, after all the previous duties are handled, and I
have surplus

I just got my Epic, and am pretty happy with it. I don't like to Solo (have
too many in-game friends), but I often partner or trio. The mana-free
Snare/DoT is very helpful,but I would never use it on a raid.

To sum up I enjoy my class and don't feel 'underpowered' or 'overpowered'. I
can do what I can do and that's enough. I sometimes wonder why other Druids
complain. But then again I also wonder why other Druids charge for ports.

One thing I did wish they had implemented was the corpse-save spell (I
believe this was mentioned a s a possibility for Luclin). The one that would
extend the shelf-life of a EXP-rezzable corpse. Too often I've been killed
somewhere with no Clerics around so I've logged off not wanting to risk
playing an Alt for 3 hours and not being able to get an EXP rez.
