I have a Chitinous Belt (it's in the AC profile, which contains only
stuff I actually possess). I think it's currently on my baby pally
baker. I did buy it for Cel, but I just don't have the heart to let go
of the Girdle of the Holy Wanderer quite yet...

Oh, and I got tired of all these links I never could see so I
downloaded and installed bare-bones mozilla. I don't run any of the
fancy magelo programs, though. Not even sure what they really do.
