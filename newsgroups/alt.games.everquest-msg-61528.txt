According to interview in Computer Gaming Monthly...

Luclin will be accessible to players of all races and levels.  You will get
to Luclin by portals that will work much like the much loved boats...You go
to a Spire, and wait...transports to Luclin happen at timed intervals, and
you have to be there...or wait until the next one.
