Hehe, i tried the tuturial before i logged into the game, and got SO 
confuced because the tuturial will only allow you to do the commands its 
telling you about at the moment, so if youre not in the run part you 
cant run and so on. Were very puzzled about that untill i got into the 
game and started playing.
