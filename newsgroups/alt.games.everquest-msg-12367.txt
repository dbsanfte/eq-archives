I sent him another email, but I will stop bothering him now.  What's the
point of putting your email in your posts if you're so uptight about getting
some?  FYI, I am not an AOL lamer I was just using that email address in
case you decided to sign me up for some porn or spam mailing lists. You can
sign up emperorstarbucks for all the porn and spam you want if you wish ;-)
He'll probably come back and post it so I'll beat him to it the subject was
whoo this is fun and the body text was lol. I suggest getting a new
newsreader.  I don't understand why you had to get so sarcastic with me in
the first place, why couldn't you have just said "changing the subjects
screws up the threading for my crappy newsreader" politely? Whatever. In the
future try not to be such a jerk to people you've never seen. I realize I
was a jerk to a degree but what can I say. You did it I did it lets move on.
