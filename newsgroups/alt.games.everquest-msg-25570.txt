Are you talking about a momentary jitter while it's changing Screen size?
like when I change screen size on the desktop it flashes and the new screen
size pops up. that's wow what I am (unsucsessfully) describing.

Say I have my spell book open, and am medding. In the middle is the book. To
the left, bottom, and right is Inv, chat, info. The area that the inventory,
chat screen, and info is in starts 'flashing' (everything goes dark then
bright repeat... does it for a random ammount of time then stops for random
amount of time. repeat ad nausium). not sure how else to explain it other
than jitters heh. now take those flashes/jitters and appy them to any time
I'm not on full screen mode (Doestn't do it on full screen with the movable
windows) Whenever the Static screen is up everything that is not in the
middle will jitter on and off. the Spell book/camera view of the screen has
no problems of this sort.

If I'm still not clear on what I'm sayin just tell me as I'm not good with
english (add to that the fact that I am born and raised american heh
although I am from Missouri so that could be the cause *Grin) hopefully
someone understands what I'm saying and can clue me in on a possible
solution to this. Although I don't think there is a solution for having
windows *Scratches head* *Shrugs*

Thanks for puttin up with my ramblings
