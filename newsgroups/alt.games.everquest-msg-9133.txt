Pretty much just agreeing with Crying.

Tailoring has the best chance of turning a profit...assuming you gather all
your materials yourself and don't buy any until you get to the point where
you want to start making tailormade backpacks (HQ bear skins are too danged
rare to hunt yourself).

But since you're gathering the stuff yourself that's also slow as molasses
to actually make decent money, but will ALWAYS be a great return on
investment.

Jewelcraft.  Heh.  Ok, I have a jeweler with a 194 skill.  I lost 3000p to
get from 70-170 skill.  After that I started selling for profit and made a
decent amount of change...

...until, that is, they changed the max skill to 255.  I can't afford to get
my skill anywhere near there, but lots of jewelers have.  Sooooo, they're
selling stuff that I can't afford to sell for less than 425 a pair for 350
or less.  A plat ruby veil that I can't afford to sell for less than 800p
they're selling for 500-600 and making a good profit.  I'm not
complaining...it was a needed change.  I just know that the best I can do is
sell gold or worse for the same price they do.  While this is "ok," it's not
much of a money-maker.  It certainly won't support skill increase practice
expenses.
