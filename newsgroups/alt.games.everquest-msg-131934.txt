Well, last night was rather interesting.  I started off by getting my
level 19 spells (yes I know I was 22, I had been too busy grinding the
night before to stop for new spells.  So I take the nexus down to Gfey,
go into Felwithe and can't find the vendor selling the level 19 spells;
however, there are 2 vendors selling the level 9 spells, which seems
odd.  So I hike my little High Elf tail down the road to Kaladim, and
get all my spells there.  I gate back up and go into Paludal.  Well, I
find a group fairly easily.  After a pull with a TPW and then shortly
after another pull where I had to gate out to survive, I decide this is
not the group for me.  And its so crowded right now I'm going
elsewhere.  So I go to HHK, nobody needs me in a group.  However, while
I'm talking in the chat channel for my guild's alliance, someone offers
to help me get some exp in the Warrens.  So we go to the warrens and we
kill a bunch of the zones I get a bunch of quest items for quests that
aren't for me.  Although, I got a 2hb staff with a bunch of resists that
is kinda cool.  However, I only got 4 blue bubbles of exp in the two
hours there, and didn't get the Bracer of the Forlorn, which is the main
reason that swayed me to go.  Well, we decide to take down the Bat Lord
one last time before my partner has to leave, and of course, I don't
make it.  So we get a pally over there and he 35% rez's me.  (On my
partner's insistence, personally, at that point, I would have just ate
the two blue bubbles)  Well, the pally sees I've had a rough evening and
offers to PL me a bit, to make up for it.  So we go into Stonebrunt and
the going is just sooooo slow, because I'm a cleric and suck at doing
damage.  (Last night was my first melee in 5 levels)  I'm not going to
go to bed until I get a level or two, so the evening isn't a total
waste.  However, while we're talking, the pally mentions, that he has a
33 druid.  I point out to him that the PLing will probably go a bit
faster with the druid's damage shield.  So he goes and gets the druid
and sticks around to get me one more yellow bubble, putting me 7 blues
from 23.  He goes to bed because he's in the same time zone I'm in and
it is now 2:30am.  I figure by this point, Paludal is not over crowded
anymore.  So I get there and start grinding and have level 23 in ten
minutes.  My group keeps grinding and I finally hit level 4 at 4:30am. 
I am barely awake at this point, a couple times I came in late with
heals because I zoned out (mentally, not to the next zone).  The group
now consists of me and two others.  I've gotta get some sleep.  I had
been telling them for a half-hour now that once I ding I'm gone.  So I
finally ding!  YAY!  The monk keeps pulling.  I say stop, I can't do it
anymore.  The monk says 3 blue bubs left for me.  I say I can't do it. 
And as soon as the next battle is over I disband.  I then pass out for
an hour and a half before getting up for work.  Hopefully tonight will
go smoother.

figure them out.
