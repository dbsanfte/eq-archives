If you count amplification I can keep 5 up. :-P
Seriously though it seems like 5 is theoretically almost possible.  You have
18 seconds before normal songs turn off, and each song takes 3.5 seconds to
sing (by my measure) and 0.3 seconds to stopsong (by this thread).  3.8*5=19
seconds, so you should be able to get all 5 with just a short (1 second)
dropping out.  That being said I personally can only get 4 barely to play
but that is manually.  May get better when I try this macro stopsong
business.  OTOH, my hand does not fit so well on 5 keys as 4.
