From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I'm sure most of us are almost convinced the player was male

Actually I'm not. This is a blatantly subjective opinion, but an oddly
large percentage of the total jackasses I've met in game have come
from the female half of a married couple pairing. I've seen it just
way too much to just shrug it off as coincidence now.

Even on test, where such behavior tends to blacklist people forever.

My personal theory is that when people are playing alone they tend to
have the reserve a solitary player would have, but when they have a
significant other present, suddenly people get a lot bolder and are a
lot less concerned about the consequences of their actions than they
otherwise would have been - presumably because subconsciously they
know their other will never reject them even if everyone else on the
entire server does.

Example (and not close to the only one I could provide): husband wife
team on test, low 50s range back a few months ago when I was first
leveling my test warrior up still. I had grouped with them a couple
times before and we seemed to be getting along fine. In Poj at the
exit though the rogue (the male of the twosome though he was playing a
female dark elf...) got the level they get an autoriposte discipline.
He wanted to try it out, and asked me not to hold aggro. Well I stayed
off taunt when aggro shifted - except it shifted to the enchanter
slowing, not the rogue. Out comes taunt. Second time same thing
happens, and I tell them that I'm not going to risk the enchanter
anymore.

The rogue is shrugging this off, I think, but his wife suddenly goes
off the deep end; after a string of insults, she ninjadisbands in the
middle of a pull, shouts a few more (a big no no on test), and marches
off in a huff. He then leaves giving the impression of someone rather
embarrassed. 

Word of what happened gets around, as it always does on test, and a
week later they had both left the server permanently. As Stephen King
would say - no big loss.

(ironically later that night there was a minipickup raid on veksar
named. I was coming along, and our group was waiting for the second
group when they wiped out. The woman had to be dragged to my group for
rezzes. I got a chuckle out of seeing her again so soon under such
circumstances. :-) Interestingly, she said the raid wasn't worth it
after being rezzed and left. That was near the last time I ever saw
her online.)

I've also seen the male side behave like a complete twit while the
female side remained calm, but it is rarer.

The worst episode I ever experienced was the male being a turd,
actually. It was in my second guide stint and someone had got dumped
in the water in TD instead of the boat. The petitioners (husband and
wife) wanted to be ported to FV - they hadn't actually died or
anything, they were just swimming out at the shuttle dropspot.

That wasn't allowed at the time (Verant was maintaining the stance
that the boats were still working). The proper response would have
been the "sorry can't do anything because we can't verify what
happened, you could have swum there" line that drives so many people
nuts; being a player oriented guide (get your guffaws in now, its the
truth) I virtually never gave that response. I noted that they were at
the approximate location of the shuttles, and I put them on the island
where the boat docks before going to FV.

The woman never said a thing but holy cow did the guy go crazy. After
screaming at me and making demands to me for a little while (hint,
people - when dealing with a CS person who obviously can't be
intimidated all that does is make them less likely to help; I feel no
obligation to go above and beyond the line of duty for some asshat) I
passed it to the server GM (Kelsiferous if anyone remembers him). He
told them that what I had offered was against the rules in their
favor. So the guy - after a slew more insults and threats - demanded
to be put back in the water where he had been dumped, and Kels obliged
him. End of story. :-) Kelsiferous was a cool GM that way, he stuck up
for his people.

I used to have the log of the conversations; used to read that when I
needed a laugh. :-)
