Bah the char doesn't even have to be deleted.
I've posted on thid before...someone was able to create a Tzen on the
Sevent Hammer server, even though mine was very much up and running.

I noticed that occasionally I could not log in as Tzen but could as
Mungoh my monk.  When I did get on as him, I got tells from friends
saying I had a name doppelganger.  The next time I couldnt log in as
Tzen, I logged on as Mungoh and sent the guy a tell.  He was pretty
cool about it - it just happened to have picked the same name as me. 
After a petition and a 30-minute wait, the GM changed the other Tzen's
name and all was good in the world again.

I asked how it could have happened - a "buggy" name filter....

Tzen
