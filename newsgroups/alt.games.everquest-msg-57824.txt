   Does it last any longer than fishrolls?  They are
a "banquet" sized meal, which I thought was the  
highest thing available.  The components are very, very
easy to get.  True, they don't give stat increases, 
but you could just carry one of the marinated muskie
in your first slot, then force-feed yourself fishrolls
to the point that you never get hungry.  A small PITA,
to be sure, but really not that hard to do.
