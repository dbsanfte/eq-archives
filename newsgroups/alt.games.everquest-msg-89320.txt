Neat the way words can be put together to influence people isn't is? 
Its called marketing and  you will find an evil breed carrying out this
task in order to manipulate people.  You yourself admit that while it
doesn't say that this zone will always be only on Legends, it leaves you
with that impression.  Current Legends players read it and feel they are
reaping the rewards of paying more.  Non Legends players may see it and
think to themselves perhaps they too should pay more in order to see
such rewards, some of them will.  Then in a few months, when the Legends
players are bored of it and its time to give them something new to chew
on, while they are busy enjoying their new "unique" zone, the old one
can be handed down to regular servers making all the folks who
complained about not getting this zone happy... well except for the ones
who will bitch about their epic not matching their shoes.
