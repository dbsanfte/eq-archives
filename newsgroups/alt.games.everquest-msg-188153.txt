NEVER top post! Never, never, never, never top post. It's a break in the
conversation. It's difficult to read. It's just plain inconsiderate.

When someone reads a post, they scroll from top to bottom. If you top post
then people after to scroll to somewhere near the bottom, fund the beginning
of the original post, scroll down to the bottom, then scroll up to the
beginning of the first reply, then scroll to the end of that, then continue
the process for each reply. Matters get only worse when an intelligent
person comes along and bottom posts, then someone comes in and top posts:
yeah it gets nearly impossible to read sometimes.

If you're to lazy (like me) or stupid (like others) to stop using OE (which
does it's damndest to enforce top posting), try using OE-QuoteFix:

http://jump.to/oe-quotefix

This will start you off for bottom posting when you reply to a message. It
will also format messages that you're viewing so that they're easier to
read.
