Without knowing, I'd say they'd decided that both spells where
making some encounters -- or the zone itself -- a lot easier than
intended.   CoTH to move groups past a particular series of mobs,
etc.   Eye of Zomm to take harm or death touches maybe?  (Does
it do that?)

It's just like being unable to stun or mez or charm some mobs.
I don't see it as a big deal, myself.

It's going to be "the" auction zone.  Being encumbered there has no
effect on movement speed, I hear.   Carrying 110kpp to buy a horse
and falling off a step or something could still be rather painful, I'd
guess.
