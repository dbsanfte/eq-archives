First Amendment applies to the US government, not a private ISP. The
*government* (in theory) can't censor speech (despite the fact that it
does frequently -- Gag orders, FCC profanity regulations). A privately
run ISP can shut your account down for saying "boo" if they feel like
it.

Interestingly, Usenet isn't the US government or really any
government. The only one that can't try to shut a person up here under
the Constitution is the US government. That's why I call the speeches
"tripe": The people that make them are clearly ignorant of what
exactly the First Amendment protects them from. Protects them from
Uncle Sam, NOT me and you. By your logic, the First Amendment would
allow me to stand in your front yard and shout to everyone passing by
that you're a child molesting pervert and you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it.

Oh, and how do you know he's even from the US? See, one thing
self-centered, US-centric fuckwits like yourself tend to forget is
that Usenet is world-wide.
