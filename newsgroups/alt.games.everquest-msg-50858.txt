Yep. kiting a hornet around BW with my bard. next thing ive been
disconnected. Another full yellow at 46. I guess the "AI" made my selo/drum
speed bard on 2 bubbles of health go into melee with fists. Yep, gonna beat
up those level 35 mobs with my fists. Good move.
Oh well, this time it only cost me an hour of bullshit and 100p for a rez.
Wasnt I lucky to get off so easily for making such a stupid idiotic mistake
of letting myself go netdead. Or my stupid idiotic mistake of living in
another country where the network isnt so reliable.
/sartcasm off

Anyone who plays DAOC know what the "rules" are about netdeath? That 1
factor will either make or break the game for me.
