As soon as you can honestly provide testimony that you have *never* in
your entire EQ career, sold an item that dropped off a mob to another
player, then that *might* start to be something utter than jealous,
whining, bullshit.  And even if you *can*, it still only makes it your
playstyle. People kill mobs and sell their drops in the bazzar thousands
of times an hour. Are they all evil?

One should have a point before attempting to make one.

Probably more, but again, /boggle.... what? Who gives a fuck? I can kill
an orc pawn in literally two seconds. Sixteen of us needed more than a
minute to kill Faydedar Friday night. How long a fight takes is
determined solely by the mob's HP and the groups DPS.

Did you have a point, or just taking a survey?
