Yes you can in Shar Vahl and in Shadow Haven also if you do a little faction work. However they do not have all the spells you may
need. Vah Shir are screwed when it comes to the divination and poison spells. East Cabilis is the only place that has all of them
except Spirit Sight which is only in Oasis that I know of. As far as the ladder try removing SoW and you will find it much easier.
Jump and wait till you start the upward motion before you start forward. I never had a problem this way.
