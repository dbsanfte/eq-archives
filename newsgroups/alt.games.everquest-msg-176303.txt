My main is a bard, and I have played a number of other classes.  They
all have things to like about them, but so far, I like my bard the
best.  And talk about XP... bards are arguably the best soloing class
in the game.  A swarm kiting bard can take a train of 15 blue con,
melee-only mobs, and turn them into a trail of mob corpses in about 10
minutes.

Bards are also versatile, jack of most trades, master of a couple. 
Fastest running in the games, highest mana regen for a group (better
than an enchanter's C5 at an equivalent level), highest resist buffs
for a group, good hastes and slow songs.  Unfortunately, they can't do
everything at once... they are pretty much limited to four songs
active at any one time, and often less because of circumstances.

On the downside, playing a bard can be a long learning curve.  And a
lot of people don't know what bards can do besides "play the mana
song".  So sometimes you have to say, "yeah, I'll play manasong during
downtimes" and then show them what you can do during battle (crowd
control, charming, hasting, etc.)
