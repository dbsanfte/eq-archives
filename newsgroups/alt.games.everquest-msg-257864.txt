Done. I actually read the entire thread a while ago, I remember all your
arguments quite clearly. Or did you perhaps post it here? Wherever it was, I
read the analysis and I couldn't agree more. I liked Koriel's summation of
the point, too. We're a solid cat family here and I know there are lots of
other cat people who would share your opinions. Here's hoping the devs take
notice and that the cycles are available for this.
