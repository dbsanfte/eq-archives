Let's see, maybe 1% of the people playing paying $40 a month, vs 99% paying
$10 a month.  I wonder where most of the revenue is coming from?  How much
does it cost to run the Legends server with dynamic GM events occuring
frequently? How much of that $40 is profit?  How much of that $10 is profit?
Multiply that by the number of people using the service, which one is making
more money?  My bet is on the normal servers for moneymaking.  I could be
wrong.  I also think that 1% is high, but noone except Verant will know
about that.
