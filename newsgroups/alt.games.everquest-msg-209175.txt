Wow, imagine that, a business wanting to make money.  How evil.

Where did you get the software you installed?  If you purchased the 
software and used the key already, then, you can simply reactivate the 
account.  If you copied the software or borrowed someone elses disks, 
then you are violating the copyright.  If you bought the game from 
someone used, then, they ripped you off.

All that being said, you can get a key for free which will allow you to 
play the original expansion only.  It's been linked in this newsgroup 
several times recently, do a search for it.
