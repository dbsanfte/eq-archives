I've got 2 real issues with it:

How are thingys made... put metal bits, water, and a bat fur into box... 
combine. Nope.  put metal bits, two flasks of water, and a bat fur into 
box... Nope... put metal bits, two flasks of water, and 2 bat furs ...

Who 'develops' like this? And how is this fun? Tradeskills should be 
handled by recipes, I agree with that entirely. But recipes should be 
purchasable, questable, droppable, etc... not 'trial and error combining'.
