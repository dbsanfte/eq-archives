This just is not true . I will assume ignorance on your part and ask that
you go do the research on your own. The single largest producer of pollution
right now is china . The uninted states is not even in the top 10 of
pollution producers.

I would be very in favor of a treaty that allowed no more pollution per year
than the us produces giving leeway for the greater of size or population .
Such a treaty would cut world pollution by more than 90%.
