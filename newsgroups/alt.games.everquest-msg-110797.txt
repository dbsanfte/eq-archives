    That one is easy. If they don't expressly forbid it, then whenever
someone has a bug that impacts their gear/XP they can sue for financial
loss. The E-Bay market price for items/characters would be the evidence the
court needs to determine that actual fiscal loss has taken place. Same thing
could happen (although this would likely get thrown out, they reserve the
right to change the game world, no?) any time they nerf an item. You want an
EULA that's as restrictive in favour of the company as humanly possible just
to avoid crap like this.
