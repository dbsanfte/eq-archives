Ok so he is an idiot, but a jerk?
He is probably earning what 1pp an hour and thus waisting far more of 
his time than anyone else's.
Was he really spamming the ooc ? If so then fair enough.

Ok so he is an idiot (still), but poorschmuck has no right to a sow and 
should not expect it for free. If he really wants it he will "donate" if 
he does not want it that bad then that is his choice.

So did you do this to help others or simply to piss the "jerk" off ?
If the former then fair play, If the latter then I will question who is 
the Jerk. After all he was not interfering with your play, if you set 
out to specifically interfear with his then that make you the Jerk. (IMOSHO)

So he is still a bit of a fool. Did he offer you any more hassle ?
I can't see anything to get worked up about here.

Good glad to see you did not claim that you owned it.

Ok the 2 comments atributed to this guy make him sound juvinial, but 
this *could* have been role play for "AFK 4 2 BRB". I'm not saying it 
was, but by this point you have already passed judgement.

Did you suggest that they pull from a wider area ?
Did you try to addapt to a grouped play style ?
Sure if you were only taking on the ?5? mobs that you had been soloing 
it would be slow, but you should have been able to take on far more.
(OK so PC is so over cammped that there probably weren't any "spare")

I had not realised that you could /ignore yourself :-/

Note that this is at least 1/2 tounge in cheek, but can you see it from 
the other side of the fence ? The SoW guy was not hurting anyone and the 
group at least made half an effort to follow the PnP, and yet you get 
all steamed up.
