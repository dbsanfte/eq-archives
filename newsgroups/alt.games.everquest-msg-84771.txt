Raising dwarf faction usually results in damaging other factions that you, as a
nasty evil Bertoxx-worshipping gnome might otherwise want to preserve. Whatever
you do, DON'T kill orcs in GFay/CB as that will damage Indigo Brotherhood
(Neriak).

The real answer is to go back to Steamfont. There's plenty for you to kill to
level 12, at which time you get Bind Affinity. The world will then be yours for
the taking.
