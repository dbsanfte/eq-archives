Anthropomorphic cats. What, are you going to start bitching about the
fact they walk on two feet in a flatfoot stance rather than digigrade
(On the toes, which is how cats walk. Heels never touch the ground)?

overlook all the other differences from "real" felines EXCEPT number
and location of breasts?
