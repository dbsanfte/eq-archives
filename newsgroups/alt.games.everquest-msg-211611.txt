Weight is rarely a consideration for non-monks.

It is much nicer...19/29 with 10 int on it.  It drops in City of Mist
every time anyone raids it for Black Reavers.  And yet it sells, if
you can even sell it, for about 25 plat.

You cannot compare the one handed weapons for rangers to the one
handed weapons for knight classes.  It is an unfair comparison. 
Knight classes get much better ratios on their one handed weapons
(there is a 1hb that drops in CoD that is like 20/26 or some ungodly
ratio and still is worth about 50 plat) than dual wielding classes
because they cant dual wield.

Using your logic, Shadowknights and Paladins get a far superior
selection of weapons than *any* other melee class since all other
melee classes dual wield and cannot pick up these nifty one handers
that knights can.

Probably 45+

And once they hit level 16 or 17, whenever it was that we got dual
wield, they will still outdamage you.  Meanwhile they can either quest
for or pick up much better weapons.

Two of these will easily outdamage anything a knight will quest for at
a comparable level.

And he will tank even better with a good 2hs (just like most knights
use when they tank)...less ripostes and bigger ripostes on the mobs.

Look.  It's really simple.  If a warrior can wield it, a ranger can
almost always wield it as well.  Warriors almost *never* use a shield.
 Now, these same warriors can choose to:

a) Use two 1 handed weapons
b) Use one 2 handed weapon
c) Use one 1 handed weapon and a shield.

If they want to maximize taunt, they generally use 'a'.  If they want
to maximize DPS (with the right weapon and some good AA's) as well as
damage avoidance, they use option 'b'.  Option 'c' isnt an option. 
Now, are you going to suggest that knights also get better weapon
options than warriors?

Is there any class, using your logic, that gets a comparable weapon
selection or did I miss something when knights suddenly became the
class with the best assortment of weapon options?
