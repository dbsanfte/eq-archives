The zone can be bugged, or his EQ can for some reason have problems 
loading the zone. I have the problem myself with Burning Woods, if i 
zone in to that, it just hangs at the load screen. Then my char is 
trapped, will just hang every time i try to log the char on.
Both times i went in there i had to get a RL friend to log me on to get 
out again.
