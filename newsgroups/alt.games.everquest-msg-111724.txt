 Actually, that's about right. It separates those who want to put in
time for the item from those who don't. With a list you can be lazy and
you'll get it eventually. If you were serious about camping it you'd
(the generic 'you') more than likely get it faster that way than
depending on some list.

 First in force works for us. But if your server is happy with the list
way of doing things then by all means continue with that.
