Right inside the gnome castle in SolA.  If you can find the castle just go
in the first gate, hang a left and the door immediately to your left is
where you want to go.

FINDING the place is rather confusing though.  You're going to have to talk
someone into taking you.   I've never seen a map that made any sense BEFORE
I learned the zone very well.

Same as JBoots.  Supposed to be 80% SoW speed.

My enchanter doesn't need 'em...druids and shaman always come running
whenever I want fast feet.
