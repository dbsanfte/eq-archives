Did you mean to put STR there instead of ATK?  You will notice (especially
if you power level a character) that as a weapon skill goes up, so does ATK.
It also goes up when you add Offense skill or STR.  Which means (I think!)
that ATK is a composite of STR (average damage), weapon skill (to hit), and
offense skill (both?).  AC being a composite of raw ac from gear
(mitigation), AGI (avoidance), and defense skill (both?).  The two seem to
be complete opposites to me.  So for AC, a composite number made up of "to
dodge" and "to mitigate" with ATK being "to hit" and "how hard."  Does that
sound reasonable at all?
