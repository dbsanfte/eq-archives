It's a LOT easier than you think. Since you have experience with a
cleric you should understand basic group dynamics. Below is a quick
list of what your role can be in a group with a SK or Druid.

Druid:
1. Backup Healer.
2. Snare runners (VERY IMPORTANT)
3. Root park
4. Damage Shield the tanks
5. Regen the tanks.
6. Evac/Succor if dungeon crawling (level 18 for in-zone evac)
7. Nuke mobs (Druids have decent nukes, and if you find yourself at FM
most of the time, a few nukes here and there will really boost the
groups efficiency)
8. Buff the group (SoW, Invigor, Skin Like XXXX, Strength, Resists,
etc)

Shadow Knight
1. Tank as Primary assist
2. Draw agro off of Clerics/Enchanters. SKs can generate agro like no
other class. Taunt, LifeTaps, *Disease Dots, *Darkness, etc all
generate huge agro. With a very good tanking abillity a SK acting as
secondary tank can keep adds occupied while the rest of the group
deals with the main target. As the main assist a SK never has to worry
about losing agro to a higher damaging class like Monk/Rouge/Ranger.
3. Snare runners (using Darkness line)
4. Feign Death Pull (after level 30)
5. Harm Touch on a bad pull to kill off a single target quickly. (Not
useful very often, but nice in a pinch)

*If grouping with a Bard or Enchanter be sure NOT to DoT mobs that are
Mezz'd or will soon be Mezz'd
