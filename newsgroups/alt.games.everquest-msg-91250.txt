Ok, wherever you read that, it was wrong. Once the Sleeper is awakened,
the warders are gone, and a server crash/patch/etc. isn't going to make
them come back. The Sleeper script is designed to run once only. On some
servers, I understand it ran beautifully, with the Sleeper waking at the
proper time, messages happening in other zones as scheduled, Sleeper
moving from zone to zone, etc. I believe Zeb was one of the ones where
it ran flawlessly. Not sure of that, of course, but I'm sure we could
ask Demorgorth who posts here often, since he was MA on the Zeb Sleeper
awakening raid.

On others, it's been buggy according to many reports, with the Sleeper
awakening when the 4th warder was killed, even though others were alive.
On at least one, the Sleeper apparently "stalled" after going through
one zone. Well, it's a work in process, but it was a hell of a nice
piece of design work by VI to provide some lasting content that the
players could actually change and impact the world around them in a
meaningful way.

As to your concerns about "not starting on a server where the sleeper
has been awakened", I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. If you are not
*NOW* already in a guild capable of waking the Sleeper, you're not going
to. He's been woken up on a bunch of servers, and on the rest it's
either going to happen soon, or it will happen when the resident
Uberguild decides it's time. On our server (Xev) there is only one guild
farming primal in ST. They have posted publicly on their web board that
they *could* wake him up, but why bother as long as it's their private
Primal farm? When another guild gets enough keys to get in there and
make a run at it, they'll wake him then. And why not? They did the work
and got there first. Why should they give up that conquest to somebody
else, or sit on their hands to let somebody else farm the place?
Besided, with the exception of a few items that are dragon only, ST can
still be farmed for primal after the warders are gone (and some claim
more easily at that!). It's really not a big thing. 

There are rumors (some originating on VI's development boards) that a
quest is either in development, or undiscovered in the game, to
"recapture the sleeper" and set the zone back like it was before. These
things will all come to light in the future, I'm sure. But for now I
wouldn't base your choice of what server to start on simply on which one
has an intact Sleeper's Tomb.
