Well, It sure does have a load of Higher level players, and it does have its
fair share of arses. dont know if I would say it's full of them though. Im
sure that whatever server you came from had lots, its just that you were
used to them, and now you have a whole new crop to deal with.

Add to that,  a lot of people will not have English as their first
language - most likely a higher proportion than most other servers - and the
chance for misunderstanding and problems increases.

I regretted moving at first, but now im in a good guild, I am pretty happy.
(even happier now that fekkin router problem is finaly sorted).
