I partner with a warrior a lot, and he has a rather, uh, bad sense of
direction, so I scream at him to run (we're in the same room IRL) and he
runs around half the dungeon, making a godly train, then dies somewhere he
doesn't recognize, leaving it up to me to run my camo ass around half the
zone looking for his body.

On the other hand, I usually get to call run since I've got the evac loaded,
and if somebody says evac, or a caster has managed to firmly get agro, I
start evac or else call run in the event that I don't have the mana (I
usually try to keep the 300 mana for evac up, but if its a choice between
evac or finish the fight and keep the room on that last 300 mana, I usually
choose to finish the fight, since 9/10 times if I evac, people decide to
leave.

As a kind of related little anecdote, me (40 druid at the time), a 35
enchanter and 34 warrior were laying the smackdown on spiders in Crystal
Caverns (I need silks) and the level 60 rogue who was busy assassinating the
Queen told me he was leaving and we could have the queen room, so we move on
down, no problem.  Now for anyone who has never been there, the queer room
is a platform in the back half with water in the front between where you
enter the room and the platform, where the queen and 2 or 3 spiders, and one
of the queens retainers spawn, then in the water is 2 or 3 fish (ebil
fishie, look like mini faydedars, level 30, velium crawlers).  Well, you can
sit in the passage to the room without agroing anything, however, theres a
single spider that wanders to that point in the tunnel, so he comes down and
hits the enchanter, then yells to the 3 spiders and 3 fish in the queens
room to come hit the enchanter...   enchanter flux stuns and aoe mez, which
hits about 2 of 3  fish and 3 of 4 spiders, warrior gets other fish on him,
I get other spider on me from heal agro (fortunately I have very high ac
compared to average druids).  So eventually, enchanter runs out of mana,
warrior hurt, and me saying evac, I hit the evac button "Insufficient mana
for that spell".  I yell IRL to run (for warrior), then while I autorun up
the tunnel to head to the geonid zone out, I spam "RUN" "RUN" "RUN" in /gsay
for the enchanter.   About halfway up the geo tunnel I shout "train to
geos"...  I zone back in up in orc area about 15 minutes later, and the monk
in the geo group is shouting "that was some train".   If I hadn't shouted
"train"  I think I could've gotten a nice score on the CFTI, eheh, for me
training has become something of an accidental hobby...  except when I
recruit a bard to pull Blackburrow for me (ALL of it), I lag newbies out
when I hit Earthquake on about 50 gnolls.
