Enough quests to have a choice. Enough that by the time you have
outleveled an area, there's still a number of quests not yet done.
Also, some form of standing/repeatable quest, in some respects.

The EQ solution came about as a way of solving the problem of who
deserves any given mob. In WoW, the mindset will be that this problem
is already solved/doesn't exist because of that rule. So people will
think its perfectly fine to try to get in the first hit, sitting a
spawn spot for an interesting mob, no matter if another group was the
one to actually clear the area to the point that its possible for a
soloer to sit there at all. This was very very bad form in EQ
precisely because of how the player made camping rules worked.

In other words, the freedom of no first hit rule caused the
conventional camping rules of EQ in the first place. Take it away, and
you no longer have the impetus to create such rule in the first place,
ergo it won't exist.

This is exactly what happened in early DAoC. Anyone who worked to
clean a spawn to the point of being able to hold it, only to have a
soloer or underpowered group come in and reap the benefits while
saying "this isn't EQ there's no such thing as camping I have the same
right to the mobs as you do".

That's exactly what would happen, more or less did happen in DAoC, and
happened in the WoW stress test, other than the differences in how its
enforced.

You inferred. I did not imply. If I am comparing, I mention what I am
comparing to.

Since DAoC derived quite significantly from EQ itself, anything that
tries to derive from DAoC is itself deriving from EQ as well in all
likelyhood.
