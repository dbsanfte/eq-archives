Not to mention the bandwidth it must still cost them (even with the fact 
that the clients don't need much info sent)

I guess the real problem for them would be that if you could have off line 
traders the 500 limit would be hit in 5 mins and never fall back below. 
That would kind of screw people 501 through 2500 :-(

If the could make the zone much less laggy, increase the 500 limit to say 
2000 and put a time cap on off line traders then it would be great.
