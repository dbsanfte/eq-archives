The entire combat system doesn't assume that the mob will choose to do 
*nothing* in its own interest. The mob may not choose the best course of 
action, but it isn't intended that they choose an absolutely ineffectual 
one either.

A red mob with a million hps that hits for 20k can be aggrokited. If you 
can outrun the mob and keep it mad at you. Outrunning it is just a 
matter of a few AA, and keeping it mad at you is just a matter of some 
low level spells, and a little cooperation from the group. 

You don't need gear, you don't need additional levels, you don't need 
resists, disciplines, procs, focus, buffs, heals,.. not even good 
weapons are really required.

Its obviously an unbalancable situation. The characters do not need 
better gear, more levels, or anything else to take similiar but tougher 
mobs.

The only work around is to make all mobs summon or give them ranged 
attacks...or ensure they aren't ever in open areas. (but this screws up 
a bunch of more legitimate tactics) or tweak their ai to make them 
attack people within range when chasing you around is proving pointless.

I've done the aggro kiting thing with my bard at midlevels when my group 
got an add there was *no way* we could fight (in places like stonebrunt, 
eastern wastes, etc)... I'd just chant kite it for a while until I had 
solid aggro, and then everyone else jumped on its back and meleed it 
down. We took mobs that were 15-20 levels on us without even taking 
damage.

It was *lame*.
