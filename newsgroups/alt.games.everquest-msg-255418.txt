So take your one group against those incredible odds.

Oh wait, you don't actually want incredible odds, do you? You want it
not just beatable but farmable.

And it reeked of plot device. Do you want a gm in EQ helping you along
too?

They were recovered from Morgoth, Sauron had already been defeated by
that point. And they recovered them by effectively mezzing everything
along the way, something that probably should be avoided for EQ.

Yeah but EQ is not a story. If you want stories in your rpgs, I hate
to tell you this but mmorpgs aren't going to be the way to go. Try
Morrowind or NWN. Even Diablo.

You must have missed the memo telling people that EQ is now a first
person strategy game, not an rpg.
