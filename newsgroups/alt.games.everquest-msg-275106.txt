Talk of Nerfing...my two pennyworth.

I know I'm not a crafter, however all I can say from all the EQ2 patches 
I've experienced is that I have noticed a difference.

A positive one.

A few days before the "big patch" a few weeks back, which introduced 
more solo content, higher armour points, tabbed chat windows, I went up 
to Fippy's Hill, decided to test what my level 15 guy was capable of 
against a group of three blue conned Gnolls. They took me out in 
seconds, I hadn't even made a dent on one of them.

The day of the patch, I returned to them, and tried again. The mystic 
was a minor struggle with his healing, but I defeated him, and his three 
warrior friends went down in seconds. It was almost the same blue conned 
mob except they had one more warrior.

Some would say this makes it too easy, but I felt it was just enough to 
give me a bit of encouragement. I knew I could still get my arse handed 
to me by guys further into the zone, the game hadn't been handed to me 
on a plate, I was just left with a slight sense of achievement, and a 
hint that the game was slowly gaining some of the aspects I enjoyed from 
EverQuest 1 (though I can't really put into words how this is, it just did).
