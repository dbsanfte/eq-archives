It's 31. But not very hard to get to at all.  (But then, mine is 158, so
that may be my ego thinking)

And bakers will buy your picnic baskets if you combine that with a boning...
understandable though if you can't be bothered with that! I buy picnic
baskets from one of my guildies for 100pp a stack (and I think they're not
making a profit, but they won't let me pay them more). It's just an easier
way to make MTPs for me.
