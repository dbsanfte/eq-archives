Sony Rating May Be Cut By Moody's on Profit Concern (Update4)
By Kyoko Suzuki
Tokyo, May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp.'s credit rating may be cut for the
first time in at least 17 1/2 years by Moody's Investors Service on concern
the world's second-largest consumer- electronics maker may struggle to
regain its past profitability.

Moody's placed Sony's Aa3 long-term unsecured senior debt rating under
review for a possible cut. The rating is the fourth highest of Moody's 10
investment-grade levels. Sony's Prime-1 rating is unaffected, Moody's said
in its report.

Sony's shares have slumped by about a quarter since Thursday last week when
the company said its fourth-quarter net loss widened to 111.1 billion yen
($934 million) -- almost triple the estimates of some analysts. Sony's
operating loss at its electronics business more than doubled in the period
after pressure to cut prices and reorganization costs squeezed earnings.

``Moody's is always a lagging indicator,'' said Alex Muromcew, who helps
manage $600 million in stocks globally as a fund manager for Loomis Sayles &
Co. in San Francisco. ``After a 26 percent drop in two days, all the bad
news is priced in and more.''

Moody's will examine how quickly Sony's electronics business can return to
profit and whether Sony's other businesses can sustain the
consumer-electronics maker's earnings.

Sony's 1.52 percent bonds due in 2011 yesterday yielded 0.596 percent, or 11
basis points more than similar maturing Japanese government bonds, according
to Bloomberg data. The risk premium, or extra yield over government debt
investors demand to hold the bonds, has narrowed from 15 basis points since
the beginning of the year. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

Debt Rating

The review affects about $10.7 billion in combined yen and dollar debt,
Moody's said. Moody's, which began keeping data on Sony's rating in October,
1985, confirmed the consumer-electronic maker's current Aa3 debt rating in
December, 1993 after placing it on review four months earlier.

``The rating action reflects Moody's concern that Sony may take longer than
expected to regain the strong profit and cash flow generation patterns seen
before,'' the ratings company said in a statement.

The maker of the PlayStation 2 video-game console expects net income to
tumble by more than half to 50 billion yen this fiscal year. That would be
less than a third the 179 billion yen in net profit Sony earned in the
fiscal year ended March 1999, even though sales have grown by about 10
percent since then.

One of the biggest drags on Sony's performance is its electronics business,
which accounted for about 66 percent of the company's overall sales in the
year ended March 31.

This fiscal year, the producer of Wega televisions and Clie hand-held
computers expects lower sales and lower profit from electronics, partly
because of costs to revamp the money-losing business. The company also
expects the stronger Japanese currency to pressure earnings.

Sony generates about 70 percent of its sales outside Japan.

The company's shares were down 10 yen, or 0.3 percent, at 2,890 as of 2:16
p.m. in Tokyo Stock Exchange trade after earlier rising as much as 1.4
percent to 2,940 yen.
