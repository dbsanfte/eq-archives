Just stating an observation.  I came back and played from April until August
when I quit again.  I leveled my Warrior from 41 to 59 during that time.  A
few people in my Guild told me about buying PP offline and that was when I
found out about auction sites other than EBay.  It used to be that you could
see server populations but now SOE only ranks them according to their name
or population but they do not give you the actual numbers.  I just figured
that since the prices were dropping then maybe a lot like myself have quit
for the time being.
