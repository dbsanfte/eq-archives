Wouldn't it be nice if they put in the keys for the firepots in the remote
locations so you could get back to the main firepot room in TD? And added a
few more firepots to get to SoL and back? Then anyone could port within a
few zones of wherever they wanted to go anytime they wanted to. It would
sure cut out a major source of aggravation for the 11 out of 13 classes that
can't port themselves.
