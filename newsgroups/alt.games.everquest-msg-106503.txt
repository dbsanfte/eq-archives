I don't have a clue what data is collected except, why would they ask you to
scroll the text so that the offending remarks are visible if it wasn't a
screenshot? I would have thought it was because scrolling is a client
function so taking a screenshot may be the simplest way of initially
identifying the text so that they can then search the log.
