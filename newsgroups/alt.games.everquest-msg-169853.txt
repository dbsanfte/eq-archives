You mean like by the creation of this new Department of Homeland Security?  
That's really going to increase my individual freedom.  Especially my 
individual freedom to criticize the government without being arrested as a 
traitor / under suspicion of terrorism, etc.  Or do you mean by how they 
keep proposing more and more backing for the 'Drug War', that some might 
see as curtailing their individual freedom to achieve the altered state of 
their choice?  Or would they be enhancing my individual freedom with their 
tough stance toward gambling?  I refer here to the GOP party platform:

--- http://www.rnc.org/GOPInfo/Platform/2000platform4.htm
Millions of Americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that
can destroy families.  We support legislation prohibiting gambling over 
the Internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are 
participating in competitive sports.
--- 

Note that they here say they want to restrict the freedoms we have enjoyed 
on the internet, too...

And then let's talk about 'family values'.  Apparently, they want to 
enhance these.  Apparently, they want me to raise my family as the 
government sees fit, which I find to be a somewhat limiting model.  In 
fact, I object to there being a model at all.  It's -my- goddamn family.
Example, from the same page:

--- http://www.rnc.org/GOPInfo/Platform/2000platform4.htm
We support the traditional definition of "marriage" as the legal union of 
one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats 
should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as 
marriages.
--- 

[NB:  I actually agree with the 'federal judges and bureaucrats should not 
force states', part, but I don't think it should prohibit them either.]

Then there's this bit:

--- http://www.rnc.org/GOPInfo/Platform/2000platform4.htm 
Just as environmental pollution affects our physical health, so too does 
the pollution of our culture affect the health of our communities.  There 
is much to celebrate in contemporary culture, but also much to deplore: 
The glorification of violence, the glamorizing of drugs, the abuse of 
women and children, whether in music or videos, advertising, or tabloid 
journalism.
---  

At least they're being up-front about exactly which parts of free speech 
they'dmostlike to see curtailed.  They can have my Weekly World News when 
they pry it from my cold, dead fingers.

But no, none of that is increasing governmental authority in any way, is 
it?  Creation of new laws prohibiting certain actions is a surefire way to 
increase individual freedom.

}You have yet to make a convincing case that Christ was talking about 
}money, and not pride.

You have yet to make a case that he was not talking about money.  You 
asserted that a gate and humility were involved on the 'eye of the needle' 
end of the comparison, but you said nothing about the 'than for a wealthy 
man to enter Heaven' part.  Remember that part?  Did 'wealthy' somehow 
mean 'prideful' in Biblical Greek?  Or could it perhaps have meant 'having 
a lot of money'?

From the argument you made, if true, I'd say it's easier for a prideful 
man to get off his camel than for a rich man to enter Heaven.  Somehow, 
that just doesn't make accumulation of wealth sound any more like a 
shortcut to paradise.
