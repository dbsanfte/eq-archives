I have tried Droga and it can be a death trap. I suggest everyone going in
read up on it before hand. A group of 39 should be able to handle most of
what Droga can through at you but it can and will swarm you at times. When
this happens expect it to take time for your group to reorganize itself.
Think about corpse recovery before folks die. The entrance to Droga is
oneway drop and so is the exit back to the entrance.
