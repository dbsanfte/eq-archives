Level 51 ranger here, at 165ish self buffed STR.  ATK at 1006.  And I
recently gave my Wurmslayer to my SK so he can work on 1hs a little.

And I'm still confused as to what would be better, the Defenders
Lightblade (20/34 right now, will go up to 22/24 as I get to 56 which
is the recommended level) or my Defiance (9/19) or the Jade Mace
(9/18).

Fear kiting in EW as of right now I don't notice any difference
between using the Lightblade in the main hand vs. the Defiance.  I
still need to test out that combo vs. the Defiance/Jade Mace combo
though.  Only problem there is my 1hb is only at 185.  Need to spend
some time maxing that out either way.
