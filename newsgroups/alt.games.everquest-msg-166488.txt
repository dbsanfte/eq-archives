I just recently purchased a 128meg gforce 4600TI and I dont have to run
around the bazaar looking at the floor anymore. Not too sure about the ati
card, because I have not checked into them but I am am very happy with the
gforce right now. Once SWG comes out it could be a whole different story
though. If SWG ever comes out, I saw that release has been moved back to Feb
now : (
