About where I am, and that is a result of just turning off new character
models.  Period.  I run at 1024x768, full clip, high detail - basically
everything cranked except new PC models.

Without those models loaded, I think the newest iterations of the client
still run faster than even the pre-SoL client.

YMMV.
