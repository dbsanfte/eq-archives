Before you loos your body because everyone keeps saying a week. YOU ONLY GET
24 HOURS.  if you are over level 10.

OK here is how it works.  IF you DON'T play any character at all, you get 7
days.  If at any point you have a character in game, or you leave the
computer at the character select screen then the decay timer speeds up and
you get only 24 hours in game.

If you play anouther character for 5 hours a day, in 3 days your body will
decay ((15/24)+(3/7))>1

TO get your body back you could eather enlist the help of some 30+ players
to help keep the island cleer, or just use the invis, /courpse drag to the
water, then you have to wiat untill the boat comes back to take you to BB.
Do some reaserch on SISTERS ISLAND and you will see a lot of post about how
people have goten there body back.

If you are under 35, grab a cofin (the one you want only costs a little over
1 PLAT) and inlist the help of a necro to summon your courps to a safe
place, or even the doc right as the bote arives. THat should give you time
to loot it before it leaves again.

NOw if you think dropping a body on that Island is bad, wait till you start
dungen crawling, and have a bad pull all the way at the bottem of the
dungen.  On the island you have lots and lots of free space, and can see all
the mobs comming at you. In a dungen every corner you turn trying to get
back to your courps is going to be an adventure.
