I disagree with the notion that Team Manaburn is the cause of this nerf.
Verant's (OK, SOE's for the nit pickers) explanation was that the change was
so that POP boss mobs would not be trivial encounters for manaburners, but
would also not be marathon battles.  I thought the explanation was a bunch
of bullshit at the time, but now that POP has been out a couple months and
even the perma-bitchers like FoH and Triton (my server's #1 guild) don't
have much bad to say about it, I consider manaburn a small price for my
wizzie to pay for the more interesting adventures he will have in POP as
compared to Luclin.

The fact my wizzie is not yet manaburn capable and that I have only done a
few small raids in POD and POI may be worth taking into account, as I may
just lack the information to make an informed opinion.  But if the choice
were mine to make -- maximize my wizard's power or maximize my fun playing
him in *challenging* encounters -- screw the power and give me the fun.
