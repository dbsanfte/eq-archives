As Mendor mentioned, you simply need to find the right place, near the
arches into CoM.  My last task had me searching the crater in Burning Woods.
As soon as I walked all the way up to the glowing meteor in the crater, I
got a message to move onto step 2.  Which took me to the giant enclave in
Dreadlands.  I stepped into the little fort, and got another message telling
me to follow the mark on my compass to the next step, an NPC in the little
town area near the spires in Dreadlands.  That was the end of it.  29 plat
and 2 ticks of exp for that, not terrible especially since most of it was
where I was heading any way, as I was heading to Chardok.
