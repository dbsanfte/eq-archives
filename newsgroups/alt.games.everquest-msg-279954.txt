It's easier to "catch up" now, in all regards, than it ever has been in the
past.  A completely brand new player can be ranked in the top 10 of his
class on his server within six months of play, something that has never been
a (realistic) possibility since the early Velious days, about five years ago.

Interestingly enough, it didn't actually "require" a zerg force.  Rather, it
could be done with a zerg force.  Or it could be done by a guild of about 40
people, all of whom had pride in their personal skill.  Of course, the
latter required people of a particular mindset, which in turn required
"guild building" and a focus on goals over "friends" (coincidentally, people
who you work toward a common goal with generally become friendly, so this
isn't a case of needing to give up something).

Perfect opportunity to go to a higher level guild since those "friends" who
you didn't want to shaft, ironically, were no longer a concern of yours.  =P

Anybody who paid for two server transfers without a *real* good reason can
be assumed to have personality issues.  This isn't me insulting you.  This
is me telling you how guild leadership looks at applications of characters
that do such sorts of things.

You don't have a very firm grasp on the reasons for, implementation of, or
mechanics of the current flagging/backflagging process.  It's a shame that
you have chosen to try to speak with "authority" and mislead people who
don't know enough to ignore your babbling.
