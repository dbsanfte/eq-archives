Yup, I can vouch for this. Except that I noticed it when I wasn't a newbie
any longer, and could kill the vengies. A poor hapless newbie would be
running for his life, run by me, and the vengie would aggro on me. So, I
guess that means I was TRAINED!!! :-)

'Cept that I was happy to kill the vengie.. good exp! :-)
