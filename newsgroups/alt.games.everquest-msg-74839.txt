Hiya!

If you know how to make hot buttons, you are already half way there...

The main thing about saying something about a particular mob is that you say
blah blah blah %T blah blah...

The  %T  is what brings back the name of the target.

This is also very useful when making an "Incoming" button for your group.
You can have your button say something like "/g Bringing in a %T!  Let's
Rock and Roll!"  Or whatever suits your fancy.

Have fun and Good Hunting!
