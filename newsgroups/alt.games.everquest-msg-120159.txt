As a mid level wizard starting to explore Velious a bit, I'm just
wondering which faction I should be careful to get or avoid ruining
for my later life?

I can find lots of info on faction modifiers & mobs but not why I
might want to worry.  OK, not being KOS with the dragon is an obvious
perk but I am thinking more along the lines of important quests in my
later life as a wizard.

Thanks
