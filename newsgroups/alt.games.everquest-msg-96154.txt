Anyone have examples of "dumb" things you've seen other people do in
their 40s or even 50s when in theory they should know better by then?

True example: 
Sometimes, the druid in the group would root the mob running away.
The enchanter begged and pleaded with her to use snare.  The Shadow
Knight puller (who was great by the way and was the reason I didn't
leave sooner) would make comments along the lines of "fine, I'll do
the slowing".  After the nth plea, the druid sighed and said the root
was mana free (had the necklace I assume) but would mem snare.  She
still wasn't very good at remembering to snare.
