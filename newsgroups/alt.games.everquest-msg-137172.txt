If somebody drops gear and logs it ain't theirs no more, no matter
how you want to paint it.  And I say this as somebody who's been drop
twinking ever since they nerfed consent twinking.  And, since you
snipped it, I'll repeat my assertion that running is optional (not to
say pointless) what would you be fleeing?

All that said, I would probably try to identify the previous owner of
the gear so I could restore it to them.  Nevertheless, it's utter
bullshit to assert that I am under any obligation to do so.
