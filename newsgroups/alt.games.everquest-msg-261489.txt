Well... lets assume assume a Iks Warrior because they have absolutely no 
utility.

1) Invis / project Illusion spells (cast on him)
2) Invis / Illusion potions
3) Luclin Spires -- this is how I did most of my to/from Kunark travel 
pre=PoP (post Luclin of course)
4) FV factioning (easier than OT factioning) -kill goblins


FWIW you'll recall that prePoP VahShir had to get through PC to get to 
SH and the Nexus. Virtually impossible for a solo non-invis class pre-
25th level. Making the run to the DL was easier. :)
