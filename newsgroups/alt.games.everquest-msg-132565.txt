If you are using the latest nvidia drivers (29.42) make sure
you have the latest VIA 4 in 1 drivers installed.

There is a serious conflict with the latest video drivers
without the latest 4 in 1's. MS windows update does not
include this currently for download, but will probably be
included in service pack 1.

Other than that, my setup is the same and I have no problems.
Except I already have the Geforce 4 and my MB does not
have a VIA chipset.
