I have a question about the horse/drogmors.  I have seen people have
their mounts parked next to them while not being on them.  What is the
command or how do you do this?  This would be most beneficial in case
I get looting duty or have to jump off real quick to pull for the
group.  It's a pain to have to click it off then re-cast a few seconds
later.  Anyone know how this is done?
