>>> > Anyone got a link to the "PC Gamer" magazine in-game shield they're
giving away as mentioned in the latest patch message?  I want to know
whether I should try sourcing the mag. in Australia or not.

I think he/she was wanting information about the actual shield (stats, look,
etc). I've not found any other info besides the what's listed on the patch
message. (which btw basically gives you instructions on how to get the item
without paying for the magazine. The one's I've seen are not shrinkwrapped,
so all you have to do is just go to page 33 and copy down the code)

http://www.pcgamer.com mentions nothing about it, so I assume the issue with
Half Life 2 is the May or June issue...
