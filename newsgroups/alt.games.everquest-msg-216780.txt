I just don't see it.  Unless the person doing pacify is also the one
pulling, it takes maybe 30 seconds extra every time you need to pacify
and it just seems to be a waste of time. I dunno, maybe I just don't
know any enchanters that pull well but I've had the best luck with
just letting a tank pull and handling however many they bring. Bring
back memories of  the old days doing Sebilis and the Hole w/o a
chanter. 

 Enchanters would probably rate as my least useful class in LDoN
(ignoring hard adventures here) but I do love bard pullers there. They
tend to be able to take hits if something goes wrong on the pull and
they also tend to be more experienced at pulling from what I've seen. 

Rgds, Frank 

  Otoh, watching a bard pull in LDoN is just depressing
