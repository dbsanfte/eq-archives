Okay. They could have been clearer but they are actually saying
exactly the same thing I am, you just misunderstood it. Look at their
examples, where they convert delays. That is exactly the same thing me
and others said.

Here's the confusing part:

"A common misconception is that a Haste effect directly alters the
Delay of your weapons, when in fact it doesn't. Haste is measured in
Damage Increase, NOT Delay Decrease. An item or spell that adds a 40%
Haste effect does NOT lower your weapons Delay by 40%, but rather
increases the amount of Damage you do by 40% over a period of time."

The damage increase comes from swinging your weapon more often in a
set period of time, not an actual modification to damage.

So they are saying the exact same thing as me and the others.
