While the tusk explaination cannot be ruled out, I have a much more exotic
theory.

You are a shaman.  Careful examination of your healing spells reveals something
interesting; your most efficient heal, mana per HP, is not a heal spell at all,
its what is known as a HP buff; Inner Fire to be specific.  This buff raises
your HP max and your current HP at the same time.  Repeated applications do not
raise the HP max any further, but they do continue to raise your current HP.

This would mean if your target had a max hp of say 200, was currently injured
down to 190, your first cast would raise them to 210 max and 200 current... no
apparant healing effect.  Second cast, though, would leave them still at 210
max, but raise current HP to 210 as well.

This mirrors your reported results.  If you are getting results like that from a
real Healing line spell, I'm back to your Tusk theory.
