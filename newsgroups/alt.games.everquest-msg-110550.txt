 I suppose. When we first started doing VP we used to all bind at the
same spot incase we had to res out. Nowadays we don't bother and just go
in and kill stuff. The difference being the soulbound VP key. I don't
think I'd take the chance of going very deep into ST (pre-Sleeper
awakening) with non-soul bound keys no matter how many times I'd done
it.
