No, I understand exactly what you are saying, and I am taking into account
the chance of failure.  The chance of failure is identical on each and every
swing, regardless of how many swings you take.  You appear to be completely
misunderstanding what I am saying.  If a fight is long enough that I get
just one hit with a 21/30 weapon, then it is still better than getting two
hits with a 10/15 weapon.  The number of hits that will land with a 10/15
weapon vs a 21/30 weapon is 2 to 1.  The damage generated by the slower
weapon is more than double the damage generated by the faster weapon.  This
means, that over time, the slower weapon will do more damage.  Unless all
you fights last only long enough to get in one hit with the fast weapon,
which has not been my experience in general.  It really is simple math.
