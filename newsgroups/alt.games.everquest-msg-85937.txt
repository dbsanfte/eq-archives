But, if they considered it an exploit, then I think that by now, we would
have been hearing about people being warned/banned/having their hands
slapped as a result by now.  I have not heard of any such instance, perhaps
I just missed it.  I would certainly agree, that at the time it was
implemented, the ability to MQ may not have been considered.  OTOH, it might
have been part of the vision.  With Verant not saying one way or the other,
it's kind of hard to say.  The one thing to consider is that Verant has
stated that cooperation among players is part of the vision, which would
tend to indicate that MQ is an intended part of the game.  Not conclusive,
but without evidence to the contrary, that is the direction I would lean.
