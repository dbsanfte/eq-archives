Paladins in particular are a sore spot with many clerics.  You often
find yourself grouping with party members of higher level than
yourself.  Paladins get the exact same spell lines you do, just at
later levels.  In the same line, the overwrite priority goes to the
higher -caster- level, instead of to the higher -spell- level, so you
can find yourself casting Valor (34 cleric) on your 35th level paladin
buddy, only to have it bounce off his Center (9 cleric)

Paladins -should- use their buffs only when there's no cleric in
the group to handle that duty... but they tend to be fairly meat
headed about it.  Sounds like you met a decent paladin, I'd
make a point out of remembering his name for future groups

AC on casters is pretty much wasted.  They could go naked and still
hardly take any more damage than if they wear their best AC gear
and you buff them to the gills.  Hit them with your HP buff line, and
with Symbol if you can afford it, but lay off the AC.  Do use your
HP buff line as a caster heal if time permits, its quite mana efficient
and recharges the buff.

Don't get trapped into doing nothing but heal.  You'll gradually
become bored with the character and drop it, if you do.  Further,
you'll never be more than an average cleric.  Learn to use the
rest of the tools Verant put in the cleric box, though, and the
variety can keep the game fresh and exciting, and you can help
your parties push further, faster, than they'd ever be able to manage
with DocHeal Only
