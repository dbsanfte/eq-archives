For the last several nights I have experienced some very strange "glitches"
in the game.  I am wondering if any others have experienced the same, or if
the problem lies somehow with my system.

When fighting sometimes MOBs are disappearing when they turn to run, and
appear later far away.

A couple of days ago I was attacked by a MOB in the mill in LOIO that I
could not even see.  (wasn't thru the wall as I was standing in the middle)

Yesterday I was fighting in a group near a tree.  Our MOB climbed the tree
and I could not see it at all.  Suddenly one of our members dropped dead.
She had plenty of health left and never recieved the msg that she was
unconscoius or had been slain.  When we finished the battle, her body was
suddenly very far from the tree we had been fighting under.

Also yesterday I was seeing MOBs fighting thin air, then when I got closer I
could see the PC, but  no MOB.  (this happened quite a bit)

Was fighting a goblin in Highpass, and we kept getting messages that we were
hitting him, but his health bar was not budging after about 50% down.

These things are happening in different places with different characters.
Some of it I can attribute to lag, but most of the time it just doesn't have
the same feel as lag.  Movement seems smoooth, and my ping bar appears
stable.

I would like to blame it on the last patch as that would be convenient, but
I just don't know.  It wasn't happening before then tho.  Any ideas?
