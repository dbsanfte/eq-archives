Cracked Darkwood is about 100pp minimum (on Bristlebane) and the Langseax is
Warrior only.
Cheap I'd look for velium weapons better than Fine Steel and magic (don't
pay more than 10pp for one tho' unless it's coldain Velium it wont' proc
till mid 20's)
For about 50pp you could get a Silvery War axe or Beserker axe 6/22 1hs

Wouldn't spend to much on a shield, in 3 levels you'll be dual wielding.
