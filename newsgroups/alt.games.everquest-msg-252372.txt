This is what goes through my overused brain cells.  I give $3k to
someone to do a SERVICE for me, hand me plat in EQ, I receive the
service but then stop the payment to those who did their end of the
agreement.  Plat is not an item to buy, but handing me plat in game is
just a service I stated I would pay them to do for me.  The service
completed can be proven, my payment not done can be proven looks like
a legal case is there.
