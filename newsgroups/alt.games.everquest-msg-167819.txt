Sorry, no.  Coldain faction begins at Apprehensive.  CoV begins quite a ways
into KoS.   And the Frost giants that are in GD, East Wastes and at the
entrance to Kael, while nice Coldain faction, are very small hits to CoV.

It is possible to get Ally to Coldain and still not be out of KoS with Claws
of Veeshan.   Considering that Apprehensive and Indifferent are very small
faction levels, unless all of your killing was in the Arena doing storm
giants (so the only coldain hits were on the fight in, and the fight
out...), it's almost certain that you are not out of KoS to CoV when you hit
Amiable.
