Yeah, this happened to me once in Lake Rathe fighting aviak guards.  I
was beating on the mob and it went snare dumb, so I was getting free
hits off.  This ranger who was also hunting in that spot then rooted
it, so of course it starts wacking me some more.  I wasn't near death
or anything, but it was slightly annoying.

Me: "Hey man, I know you're trying to be helpful and everything, but
could you not root them when they're almost dead?  It makes them
attack instead of just stand there"
Him: "hehe"

I don't know if his English was bad and he was just trying to be
helpful, and didn't understand what I said, or was just being a prick.

Last night I was being too helpful in FM...this warrior was fighting a
goblin raider, so I cast a heal and thorns on him.  He should have
been able to kill it pretty easily, but he started running to the LoIO
zone.  I snared it thinking it would buy him some time...turns out he
was just pulling it to his group.  He wasn't mad or anything, but I
apologized at least...
