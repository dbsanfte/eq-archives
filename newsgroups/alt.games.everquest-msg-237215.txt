Lol... I know what that's like. 

I had a friend once who hated Jon Stewart after seeing part of an
episode of the Daily Show... he thought he was really ignorant the way
he deferred to Bush's brilliant war plan (while the war was in full
swing).

I guess he missed the entire 'satire' part of it... he came around
when I made him watch another one... in that case it was the one where
they offered free fixin's to that couple to dissuade them from moving
to Canada. He's a fan now. :)
