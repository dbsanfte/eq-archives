I don't doubt it. I PLed my SK yesterday for a bit. Averaged a level 
every 6 minutes from 6th to 13th. With only a 30th level druid for help.

And I did 38th to 39th in under an hour with a bard yesterday, just 
being in a group, with no high level buffing. I'd have little doubt that 
  a good buffed group with high level help, and good knowledge of where 
and what to hunt could get 46th in 24 hours. Just using rough figuring 
of an hour a level from 30-46, half an hour a level form 20-30, and 5 
minutes a level from 1-20. And that's probably a generous amount of time.
