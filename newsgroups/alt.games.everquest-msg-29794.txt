Simmer down folks.

We don't know what the incompatibility is. Could be the Win2K OS - I don't
know. Haven't tried running EQ on a 'clean' install. However, since
thousands of folks seem to be running EQ and Win2K just fine I suspect the
problem lies elsewhere. Maybe it's Norton + DirectX 8, or Real Player +
Quicktime. There are many services that run in the background of all OS's.

I listed my applications and peripherals in an attempt to find a common
culprit in the configurations of those having problems.

Besides - I just got my Windows XP RC1 in the mail...
