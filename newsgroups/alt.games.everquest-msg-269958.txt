This is easier said than done, human nature being what it is.  We almost, 
note I said almost, always take the path of least resistance, the easiest 
way out.

If EQ suddenly made available unlimited plat, uber equipment, house 
filled with items, and instant level 50 that players could take as option 
when starting the game, who would pick the slow hard way?  Virtually no 
one.

I think the books should have been made available for level 40ish and up, 
or something like that, where the 'exploring' has been done to death, 
you've worked for a living and you're bouncing around the world like a 
superball and deserve a break.  But not for newbies. They have to play 
the game by the rules......see thread on 'optional grouping whiners'. :)
