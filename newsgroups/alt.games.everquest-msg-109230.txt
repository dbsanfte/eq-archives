From what I understand the Bazaar code IS finished but it doesn't work with
new UI they are releasing so has not been implemented. As this new interface
has not been finished they cannot address the problems with the bazaar code
until it is. Think I read that here, somewhere.
I don't think such a notice board would be difficult to add, considering
what is already there but I agree, it is as open to abuse by morons as any
other part of the net.
