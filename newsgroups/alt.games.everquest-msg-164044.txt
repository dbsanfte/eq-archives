He does seem overly cranky, but he raises an interesting point.

There are a lot of people out there who aren't computer geek-ish
enough to be able to find their EQ directory, track down a given
file (among the hundreds there), pop it into an editor, find
the right line, know how to patch it without mangling it,
and saving it back to disk correctly -- much less debug things
when that doesn't quite fix the problem on the first pass.

If I were SOE, I might look into adding a facility to the
game software that allowed them to examine and tweak your
INI files and other system settings remotely, perhaps for
a minor fee.  (And only with your permission, of course.)

Most common configuation problems could be fixed with a
single-button macro on the SOE side, like "Erase player's
TXC files", "reset player to default skin", "back up INI
file and install 'fresh' copy", yadda yadda.

Or come to think of it, they could write a simple "troubleshooter"
app that lived client-side which would walk the user through
standard problems and have buttons to automatically take care
of such things, instead of frequently asking users to
manually diddle their files.  Such an app wouldn't have
to be any more complicated than the many INI editors that
are out there for free.
