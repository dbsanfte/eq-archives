Out of curiosity, have we seen a *full* list of cleric spells from PoP
yet? It seems to me that middle-tier guilds may actually be better off
now with 3/4 heal druids and shamans to fill out the rotations when
they're low on clerics. Even after PoP, only the biggest guilds will
have tanks buffed up past 7500 hps.

Couple this with an "utterly complete heal" that comes in at 50+ and I
really don't think anybody would suffer much.
