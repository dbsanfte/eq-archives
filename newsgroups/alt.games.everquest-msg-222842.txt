Personally, I like the new lighter color, makes the messages a lot easier 
to read so I can tell if something is KOS or not.

I think the targetting thing is a good idea (I haven't been able to 
actually see it yet).  Though the ring around the target box is kinda lame.  
I didn't think it was that hard to hit 'c' in the first place to see what 
color something conned.

Yeah, I'd like to see some other changes made, but those changes are much 
larger and I'm glad they're putting a lot more thought and time into them 
than cosmetic stuff like this.  In the meantime, some of the minor and 
cosmetic changes are nice to have.
