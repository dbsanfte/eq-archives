It would be so nice if it manifested like that for me, but all I kept 
thinking was "who was the intern who designed this useless minimap?" and 
"gee, that forest floor texture is tiling bad."

It's like with a bad movie. If the characters are interesting enough 
that I'm drawn into their situation, bad special effects and gigantic 
plot holes pass by unnoticed. I don't care about those kinds of flaws 
because I *do* care about the characters and what they're dealing with. 
But when the characters are unengaging, suddenly any logic holes in the 
story loom large and I'm paying attention to the effects as effects.

Same with WoW -- I'm having a hard time identifying with my characters 
(any of them, I have so far made an NE Druid, a Dwarven Rogue, a Human 
Paladin, an Undead Wizard, an Orc Hunter, and a Tauren Hunter). I don't 
feel like I'm contributing to their uniqueness in any way. I can't get 
them to look really much different than anyone else. The equipment I 
find is just like everyone else's. There seems to be a 50:1 PC:NPC 
ratio, so the world is populated by me and a bunch of other people who 
are doing pretty much exactly the same thing I am (and look basically 
the same, since we have to start off with our own "kind"). My skills as 
an adventurer can't be in that high a demand, yet I can't figure out 
what motivates my character to keep doing it and not just go back to 
being a forager, farmer, corpse, or hunter (food hunter, not the Hunter 
class).

Granted, a lot of this is just because I'm burnt out on Tolkien swipes, 
and the WC universe in particular. I guess I want something deeper, and 
Blizz likes to only go skin deep.

It's a question of consistency. What *is* that minimap up there? Is it 
supposed to actually be my map? Fine, but then why can't I mark an X and 
say "contact here"? It also bugs me that my little pointer icon rotates, 
but the map doesn't. I'd much rather I always point up and the map spins 
to show me what's ahead or behind. Faster to read, but that's personal 
preference.
