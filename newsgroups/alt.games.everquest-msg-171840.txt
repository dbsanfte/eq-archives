Just target the mob to be mezzed long enough to start the mez song,
then you can switch to the mob you want to fight. As long as you don't
stop the mez song (by starting a different song or my getting stunned)
the mezzed mob will remain mezzed, even though it is not targetted.
You can also twist other songs as long as you switch back to the
mezzed mob to start the mez song again before the prevous mez wears
off.

If there are multiple mobs needing mezzed, I just concentrate on
keeping them all mezzed by switching between them each long enough to
stop and restart the mez song. I'm just a man, not a machine.  :)

Rumble <--- Still can't imagine instrument twisting working with any
reliability
