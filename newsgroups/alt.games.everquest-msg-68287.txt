Ah, now you're changing from absolutes to "many".

Yes, you're quite right, many are having trouble. Likewise, many are
not. I played for 6 hours tonight with nary a glitch. I'm not unique
in that experience.

As for judging what the real percentage is based upon web board posts,
that would be madness. Surely we all recognize that posts go up
dramatically when people have something to complain about? Web board
posts are not indicative of the overall picture.
