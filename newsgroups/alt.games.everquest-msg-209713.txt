You do have to click something.  Either accept or decline.  That Follow button
will hang out there, make it impossible for you to get invites from people who
you -did- want an invite from, and even from time to time cause a bug that
prevents you from declining -or- accepting (I think because the inviter zones or
dies or logs out or perhaps just fills up his group...)

People also find it rude that other people inspect them without their
permission.  This to me is more senseless than the invite thing, but its the way
they feel.  Enough people feel this way, and have expressed that opinion openly
and widely enough, that we all are aware its rude, which is to say its against
the social mores.  You don't have to understand why they feel this way, its
enough simply to know that they do for you to be rude in ignoring it.  And if
you don't know that they do, its still rude behaviour on your part, just
blameless, you were ignorant of the social more against it.

Oh, now invite hell is a far worse rudeness, consisting not of honestly inviting
someone you thought would want to join you, but maliciously and repeatedly
inviting someone you know -won't- want to join you, spamming them with invite
messages and deliberately interfering with their ability to group with others,
and dramatically increasing your chances of getting that weird invite bug up
their butt.  That's not just rude, in fact, its probably a warnable offence,
harassment.
