Well since I can not log on tonight and I am tired of reading about it, I
thought I would give a new subject to get some insight on.  I have been
thinking about making a Dark Elf and I want it to be the most evil/hated
class that is available.  I don't expect to play him often, but there are
times when you just wanna be oppisite of everything in the real world.

I know this is all just opinion based, but any info would be great.

TIA
Ben
