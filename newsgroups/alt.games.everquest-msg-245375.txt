OK guys... please refrain from flaming me... But I'm done with EQ &
wondering if my guys are worth anything.... Any advice is welcomed....

I've blown 5 years of my life on this, I'm sure you guys know what I
mean... I would appreciate honest input: Are my guys worth anything?

The point I stress is that they are a dual box system, which is
unique.... There is nothing like me on my server.... My two accounts
will only be sold as set. All my guys are twins, named & dressed the
same. There are 6 twins in the set, all above 50, two of them are
mains with level 65 and 100+aa. The mains are druid and enc with dire
charms. If you know anything about this game you know that is a deadly
combo, I solo stuff that groups of 6 wipe out on. It is a dual box
dream, there is NO combo that beats dru & enc with dc. (this is not up
for arguement, newbs pls dont respond to that).

THE QUESTION: Where do i ebay, since ebay is dead? Is there still a
market? What is the most popular site for this? Are my guys worth
anything? How much, ballpark?
