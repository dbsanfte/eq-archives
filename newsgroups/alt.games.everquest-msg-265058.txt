What? KDragon's gender? Surely that's not complicated by another factor.

That's a legitimate, but separate issue.

Why didn't they send the form that said, as you are no longer a customer 
we drones aren't able to provide you support, please forward your 
inquiries to head office.

Forward it on up, especially if this wasn't the first incident. If 
players feel they are being kill stealed, then they are being 
killstealed, redefining the activity as legitimate doesn't make it go 
away. And if multiple players are leaving over it, then the mechanics or 
policy require a review.

The policy obviously doesn't reflect the reality.

Ah... so he used the improper term and thus he doesn't have a problem. 
Suppose I buy a toaster and it keeps burning my toast and when I 
complain about it the support team asserts that the toaster can't burn 
toast it only toasts it to varying degrees, therefore I don't have a 
problem, and my ticket has been closed. Would you accept that?

Of course, if I had complained that the toaster is not toasting my toast 
to the degree that I was selecting... well THEN I had a legitmate gripe, 
and if I'd just complained about THAT things would have gone quite 
differently...

riiIIIIiiight.
