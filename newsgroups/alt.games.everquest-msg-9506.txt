It all depends on context, particularly the "I got your KID" part.  It 
makes no sense at all the way I interpret it at first glance:  "I have your 
child hostage.  Feel free to commit suicide." The second half is very 
bizbee-like, actually (the "please do us all a favor and kill yourself" 
style of phrase).

As an isolated sentence, it's weird.  As a threat, it's poorly done.  As a 
reason to ban someone?  Hmm.  Obviously the person is pretty comfortable 
using fairly harsh tones.  But you know what?  I don't have to run an 
online game (been there, done that, am recovering nicely now, thank you), 
and they do.  I'm very impatient with folks who try to pretend they have 
some kind of right to trial when they are obviously spoiling things for 
other people.

And I am *very* unimpressed when a jerk gets kicked and then goes crying to 
everyone about how mean the staff is.  Bah.  I've been in a similar 
position, and staff do NOT go around kicking people for fun.

But I know we will never hear the whole story from both sides, so I shan't 
worry too much over it...
