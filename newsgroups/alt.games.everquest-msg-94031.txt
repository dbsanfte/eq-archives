Tried unrest yet?  at 15 that's where I made my level plus a few, i think i
got to 19 there.  Learned how to make a train hotkey because of there (I was
such a noob, didn't know how to do it).  Learned the value of chanters and
not to attack mezzed mobs.  Lots of good experiences there.  Lots of deaths
there too but that's the fun in adventuring.  Made some friends there I
still talk to and group with occasionally.   Don't go to LOIO unless there
is a real good reason, it's overrated and has way too many kids whining all
the time.  Don't forget about Stonebrunt for when you hit 20 or so, good
solo spot.
