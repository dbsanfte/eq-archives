Because it's a wasted night that could have been spent doing something 
that actually resulted in improving ourselves.

Maybe you missed the part where I said I like moving on to new challenges.  
No, I don't expect to succeed on things the first time.  That doesn't mean 
my guild of average raid level of 55, with maybe a 15 scant pieces of ToV 
armor spread between us should go charging in to NTOV.

Of course they are.  When we first did Gorenaire I really didn't think we 
were going to kill her, but I knew we were close.  We had several wipeouts 
getting the timing right, but we finally killed her.

And they also don't get their Uber mob kills by continuously throwing 
themselves into situations they obviously aren't ready for either.

There are some things my guild needs to SERIOUSLY work on.

Thanks to everyone else who understood where I am coming from.  I don't 
know if my approach is going to change but it helped to vent and here how 
other people have dealt with this type of thing.
