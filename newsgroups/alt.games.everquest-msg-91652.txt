By the way, this also means that upon reaching maximum level in DAOC 
(50), you can start screwing around as much as you want. You can do the 
"I wonder what happens if I do this" shit. You are not gonna lose level 
50, ever. You do not have to worry about your next RvR death being an 
exp death any more.
There are some crazy things people wanna do sometimes. For example, I've 
always wanted to try a one-man city raid. So I got my shaman and my monk 
and killed all the guards in Freeport (except the uber newbie ones). It 
was fun. I died a few times, and it was still fun, though losing half a 
level or so bothered me a bit
