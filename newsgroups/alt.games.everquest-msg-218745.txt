Zebedee is an LPMUD game with an international user base.
We're around 10 years old now!

It's easy to get started - we have the Newbie Helper tutorial
system and quickstart help guide, and several newbie areas.

Game style is your familiar fantasy-medieval hack, slash and quest,
with a few surprises thrown in and plenty of humour! We've a few
thousand rooms and bucketloads of original objects and monsters.

We have five distinct main classes with 200 skills between them, one
secret class and more classes to come!  Plus there are many quests
to take on.

At Legend you get your own mini area and never drop back to player level.

Playerkilling is level-restricted, but monitored for control, so not to
put people off. Partying is encouraged (multiple party membership).

There is much else to say, many other features,
but instead why not pay us a visit:
