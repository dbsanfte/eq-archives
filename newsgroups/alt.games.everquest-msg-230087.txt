As a ranger you will probabably be using 2*1hs 90% of the time, a 2HS 9% of
the time and bashing weapons the rest :).  Having said that, I maxed all my
melee skills in (including throwing and h2h hehe).  It's never too late to
get your weapon skills up, just ok it with your group first, or if not
grouped, ask if you can take a few practice swings at any blue (or higher)
mobs they are fighting.

At the high end of the game, there are some very sweet ranger-usable bashing
weapons (I saw a 19/20 and mega stats one) that dropped from Corinav a few
days ago, so you might want to get those skills up to speed :)
