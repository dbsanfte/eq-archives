There are two Faydedar spawns.  Only one is triggered.  The triggered one
spawns inside the hidden oasis and is very unlikely to end up near the
Firepot room.  Some people DO train him out of the oasis to fight him, but
they would probably not take him anywhere near there.

The other one is either random or on the usual once/week + variation dragon
timer, and does go near the Firepots.  That's probably the one you saw.
