...and the reason the GM gave was exploitation, using a cleric under the
bridge to maintain agro on the mob while it couldn't hit him. Anyone
who's ever played the high level game, knows full well that if the mob
is agro on you, can't reach you, and is above L50, *HE WILL SUMMON YOU*

Conquest seem to think they're being punished for showing the entire EQ
public that the Sleepers storyline is incomplete. The Sleeper is a
nekkid hummie? Yeah, right hehe

I sincerely hope VI CS looks at the history of the GM who ruled on this
banning, because he seems to have a record of anti-uberguild actions. It
may be that his job description means he's responsible for uberguild
actioning, but if not, it's a big coincidence he's turned out to be at
the centre of several dubious actions against uberguilds
