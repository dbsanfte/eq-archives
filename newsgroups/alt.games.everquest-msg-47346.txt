Not entirely true. You're having a problem with Visa Billing. You may
believe it has something to do with Everquest, but that doesn't make
it so.

Countless ways. Credit card billing errors, and fraud, predate online
shopping by a good long time, and it's far more likely that your
problems are *not* the result of any situation with SOE.

Since, as you say, you used your card 8 months ago, please note that
the hacking, according to the same sources you quote, happened in
October of 2000 - 12 months ago.

So scratch that theory.

>I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to deal with Sony Online and I am just being "Jacked" around,

If you have billing that you don't think is valid, you *should* be
dealing with your credit card company, and possibly the two companies
that billed you. Sony can't do squat about billing on your card that
they didn't initiate.
