Drop an item on it, and if you can equip it, it will equip the item for you
in the appropriate slot.  If it is something that can go in more than one
slot, like a weapon, then it will equip in the first open weapon slot that
it can go in, from left to right.  If you cannot equip it, because that slot
is already filled, or you are unable to equip the item in question, or it is
not an equippable item, then it will go in the first available main
inventory slot.  If no main inventory slots are available, it will go in the
first available slot in a container that it can fit in.  If it can fit
nowhere on you, I'm not sure what happens now, it will either drop on the
ground, or end up on your cursor.
