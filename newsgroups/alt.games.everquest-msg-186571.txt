In the end, there's a trick to everything. (Depending on how you look at
it.) But this one sounds pretty monstrous. Furor's been finding the 
tricks a lot longer than most of us have been playing, and certainly 
found more than anyone else as a "ground breaker" over the last few years.

I think his last strategy quote was something to the effect of, "I guess 
we'll just wait until three or four lower tier guilds make it up here, 
then we'll throw five hundred people at this bastard and we'll all float 
into Plane of Time holding hands and singing fucking Kum-bay-ya."

My next question to you, oh Master of Prognostication, is what happens 
*after* they get in? :-)  I mean, let's face it. Beating this encounter 
isn't "The End of Everquest" or "You've Won the Game". That's just to 
get in the door of Plane of Time. Then there's an entire "zone" (though 
from the sound of it, it is likely to be a series of mini-zones taking 
place in various epics of Norrath's history) and at the end of that, 
there's a "Plane of Time B" beyond it for whatever the mythic final 
encounter is, yes?

How long until PoP is *DONE*, and who will do it? ;-)

Two more jars of jellybeans ready if you peg this one too.
