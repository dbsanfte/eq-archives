Hi everyone:

I want to create an alt, one that's pretty diverse from my level 56 Wizard,
and I seem to pretty stuck on wanting to create an Enchanter, in fact I have
made one as a test, taken him to level 8 already but want to re-start.

My question is, can someone give me a link that will take me to a Site
strictly for Enchanter's, much along the lines that Graffe's Site is for
Wizards? I'd be very grateful indeed .. All I can seem to find are Sites
that give a walkthrough of the Enchanter Epic ..

Thank you as always, safe hunting to you all ...

Stevie (Stormhammer)
