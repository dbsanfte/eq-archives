Looking at the screenshot, I venture that you are SOL. If the tga file 
for the ring texture must have a fixed resolution (which I believe to be 
the case), it's not very likely that you can make those letters look any 
smoother than they are now.

On the other hand, if the indicator can be a square tga of arbitrary 
size, I suppose the original author (other than Sauron) could re-do it 
at a higher res, but it would have to be made from scratch.
