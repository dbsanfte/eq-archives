Good general rule of thumb:  Only use training points to raise the skills 
you -really- don't want to raise yourself.  In my mind, this rules out 
everything but the first point of new melee skills (like parry, where 
you have to train one point to ativate the skill), first point of 
languages, and occasionally the higher points on research or poisonmaking, 
depending on class.

My enchanter main ended up at level 65 with ~250 training points banked, 
so then I just blew them on the few skills not maxed yet... Which were 
Research and Hand to Hand combat. :) If a skill doesn't go up easily, you 
probably don't really need it... with the exception of defense, which you 
can't train that way anyway. :)

There's very little pressure to spend your training points the minute 
you get them... Wait a few levels, and if a skill is lagging and 
inconveniences you repeatedly, and trying to raise it otherwise becomes 
frustrating, go pump them in then.
