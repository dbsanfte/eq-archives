I think 30 is the max anyone can train.   I have a screenshot of
Halloween event 2004 where about 30 skellies were chasing a poor level
70 necro out of EC.

It may be possible to get 60 if you can get pet to tag 30 and you
aggro 30 more then use /pet hold to stop pet from any more attacks so
it can live and train 30 along side yours.
