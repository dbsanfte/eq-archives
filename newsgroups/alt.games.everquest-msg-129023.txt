Both of my 50+ rogues are epic'd (main was 3rd rogue epic
on E. Marr).

The weird thing is that I only have one account (although I
do use my brother's occasionally when I know he's working
and I can park his druid somewhere to PL my alt rogue up
a bit).  All 4 rogues (including the two 50+ epic'd ones) are
on the same server on the same account.

That's 4 of eight used.  I just can't help playing my gnome
SK or my high elf paly trying to get into BS position when
I'm grouped...
