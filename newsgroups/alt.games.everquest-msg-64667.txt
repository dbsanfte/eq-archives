Also, if you have a 128MB stick of ram you need to get other 128MB sticks. You
can't have a 128MB DIMM and a 256MB DIMM on the same board. You pretty much
want to buy the exact type of RAM you have now to place in each DIMM expansion
slot.

Wo Who.....19 hrs left until the patch is DL'd.....Can't wait to see what the
next problem is gonna be!
