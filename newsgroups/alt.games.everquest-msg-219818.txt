At a guess based on my experience there, probably a 1 in 100 chance to 
drop it.  That's from the experience of getting 4 of them total.  Pretty 
quick and easy if you have a small AoE group of level 65ish folks.  
Really, one wizard would probably be enough, we managed with one cleric, 
but, she did have to AoE a few times to kill them all.
