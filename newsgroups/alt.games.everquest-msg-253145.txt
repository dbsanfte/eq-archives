Last week someone posted that the person playing a guildmate of ours
had died in real life (the person posting being the boyfriend).
Chucked off the back of a horse down a mountainside while at a family
gathering! (not quite in those words)

There were lots of comforting posts and questions about donations to
the funeral and all that sort of jazz. Many people were downright
upset and didn't play EQ during the next few days or were morose on
teamspeak.

Yesterday he comes clean, admit it was all a hoax done at the behest
of a few drunk friends, admit that he was the actual player of the
character, had been pretending to be female for a couple years, and
that the person who "died" never existed.

Besides being one of the sickest things ever done to people in EQ, how
often does someone quit by faking their own death? /boggle

This being Test that character is under a TSDS (test server death
sentence) which ends its career permanently (L65 elemental rogue). I
guess its one way to kick the habit.
