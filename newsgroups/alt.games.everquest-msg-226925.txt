I know you are right, and I appreciate all the responses.
I wish my dead guy *would* have yelled or whined or complained or *anything*
instead of no response at all.  I'm just picturing this guy sending nastygrams
to my guild and /telling all his friends what an idiot I am and not to ever
group with me....
Sigh. That said:    
I am still pondering the Superior Heal vs. Remedy question: Superior heal casts
in 4.5 seconds and is a better heal, but Remedy casts in 3 seconds for a lesser
heal??   What heals does everyone else keep memorized in groups at level 53?
(I guess that means I'm getting past the *Am I even cut out for this job?
phase* and getting to the *How can I do it better next time? phase*).
Thanks again for all the advice.
