Well the tank in my group knew I was botting the cleric and stated his
intentions were NOT to tank.

Of course the first pull brought 4 of the mobs, who rampaged through half
our raid.  He was at 2 bubs when I cast the cheal (when it was clear he was
tanking, not just taking riposte damage) and the cheal landed just in time,
that shit hitting fast for 800+ can really take you down fast.

It was just a mess though.. had I got DA/DB off, im quite sure they would
have just waited before kicking the shit out of me.   Theres nothing like
losing 4-5 people instantly on the pull to instill chaos into the raid, and
almost wipe to trash :)

We had the clerics and warriors to keep it all under control.. they just
didnt react.  The first warrior would have all 4 agro on him and drop in
seconds (even with defensive), then the druids/misc healers would get
crushed.. then a tank would finally get 1 mob to himself, but his cleric was
already dead.. so he would be shortly after too :)

Keeping him up with a botted cleric wouldnt have been difficult had the
situation been more controlled.. e.g The Elder thought horror guards (yellow
to level 60) are probably similar in HP/DMG to those snakes and come in
multi pulls, but cuz each 1 had a tank on them from the start, and a proper
assist setup, I was able to keep the same warrior up quite comfortably
