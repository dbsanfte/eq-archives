But you were not unaware of their meanings, having, I am sure, been exposed
to American "culture"
On that basis. If an American posted "all PvP'rs are Wankers" would you be
offended? Wanker is not considered an obscenity in the states.
If you asked anyone under 35 in the UK what Poontang meant I bet they'd be
able to tell you.

Your post comes across as someone who thinks that because they play PvP they
are l33t and all those on blue servers are llama's.
I'd not normally bothered to reply if you hadn't used the "I'm from the UK
and didn't know what it meant" excuse.

In answer to your question, there are plenty of PvP'rs here. They are
normally only obvious PVP players when a question arises that is directed at
PvP or a situation where an item, spell or character class is viewed in a
completely different light on their servers. They are, of course, a minority
compared to the "Bluebie Poons" as red servers are in comparison to blue
ones.

I play Counterstrike, I KNOW I'm l33t ;ï¿½)
