Don't want to piss off Rogues either, quite handy for retrieving corpses
in kos areas.  Mages can provide you with Food, Water, Arrows, Weapons
for you or your pet, Rings of levitation (ac5 and no bat wing
component), Call of the Hero if you get seperated from the rest of the
group or other situations it comes in handy, Mod Rods for that cleric
rezzing everyone on your raid.  Shadowknights make decent feign death
pullers as well as monks, They can also cast locate corpse.  Paladins? 
Well I am sure there is some reason not to piss them off too, but can't
think of anything now.  Oh how about LOH.

Yes i know it was humor, but felt I had to point out to the humor
impaired why you shouldn't piss anyone off if you can avoid it.  Not to
mention there is that whole reputation thing to be invited into a guild,
on raids if unguilded/small guilded, etc.
