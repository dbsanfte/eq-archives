Paladins are in the running.  The quest isn't "hard",
exactly, but in order to get it you have to rely on sheer
luck, like winning the lottery -- you need not one, but *two*
rare drops from raid-level mobs with a week-long spawn rates, 
which would be bad enough, but when you add in the fact
that a few thousand other Paladins are competing for the same drops...

And the reward is just a sword with a decent damage/delay,
and a decent proc.  Nice, but nothing to write home about.
It'd be a fine sword if the quest were as doable as, say,
the Rogue epic, but given how excruciatingly tedious it is
to have a *chance* at the Paladin epic, it seems to suck
on the time invested/reward scale.

There's an easier quest in DN/Skyshrine that returns a
better weapon.  Sigh.
