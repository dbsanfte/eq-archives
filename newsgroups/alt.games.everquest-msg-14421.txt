It does actually seem as though they are learning from previous issues
that coming out with information is better than being too quiet.  In
cases like these I'd say that waiting until a final decision has been
reached and then making a statement that includes as much info as this
one does really makes their case well for them.  I don't think they
should make info public till they've concluded their investigations, but
in a high profile case like this if you say nothing the feeling is that
something is hidden.  With the facts out there at least people can judge
them on the merit of those facts.

My problem would not be that they were close to the mob but not
attacked, it was that they maneuvered the mob there and either got it
stuck on the terrain or held it with agro from a non dangrous spot while
they set up for the fight.  From the info VI released and the commentary
in reply from Cq it appears that they were doing one or the other and
either is an exploit in my eyes.
