I didn't say "best", I said "independent", which is basically the same thing
you are saying. :-)

It depends on what it takes to get people to cancel.  Suppose, for example,
you've got a certain percentage that are very sensitive...hit them with a
couple patches in a week and they are gone.  Then there is a larger group
that will take a bit more punishment before throwing in the towel.  Finally,
there is a big group of addicts that will take just about anything, perhaps
not with a smile, but they won't cancel.

Then if Sony first screws, say, the Aussies, they lose the sensitive group
of Aussies.  Now consider the next time they need a series of patches.  If
they do the Aussies again, they've *already* lost the sensitive ones, so
they are only risking the intermediates.  The intermediates in the Aussies
might be a smaller group than the sensitive Americans, so Sony is better off
going ahead and screwing the Aussies more.  Finally, they reach a point
where they only have the hard core Aussies.  Time for more patches?  Screw
the Aussies again, because the Aussies are all hard core, so will stay,
whereas if they patch in American prime time, they'll lose the sensitive
Americans.

The people outside of the American time zones need to show Sony that they
are all sensitive or intermediates when it comes to taking repeated patches.
