People can occasionally survive some pretty severe injuries.  Check
out the deaths of Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson.  I forget
which it was, but one of them was in a shootout with a couple of FBI
agents.  The gangster walked up to where the agents were shooting and
blew them both away.  While he was walking up to where the agents
were, they were firing machine guns at him.  They hit him something
like 19 times, but he still managed to walk up, kill them both, walk
back to the car, and drive away.  The wounds were fatal, and he died a
short time later.
