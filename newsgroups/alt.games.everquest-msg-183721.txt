Here's an EQ example.  When my druid was a little druid, I dreamed of
hitting 34 so I could quad.  Read everything there was to read about it.  I
was ready.

DING 34!  Whoo hooo!

Port to Butcher, run to Crazed Gobs.  Yippee!  They're open.

Snare 1.  Snare 2.  #3 resists.  Back off to re-throw .. hey, wait a sec, I
must not have given the other two enough pull distance 'cause here they
come.  Turn to run, #3 stuns me.  Get un-stunned and run.  Turn around,
there's my buddy #3 again.  Oh yeah, I need to snare him.  Back off ... why
am I getting higher?  Oh, I'm backing up a wall.  Turn to the left and run
... take falling damage.

Your spell is interrupted.
Your spell is interrupted.
Your spell is interrupted.

Turn to run.

Your Snare spell has worn off!

Where's the guard shack?  Why can't I find the guard shack?  I know this
zone like the back of my hand.

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.

Academia fails.  Real world wins.

Learned how to quad that day.  Not a minute before.
