   I've gone into two dungeons so far, with 2 failures on normal
setting.  And we didn't have to fail.  Seems because there is a timer,
some people believe that that means charge forward regardless of the
cleric's mana.  And pleas of "Look, it will take even longer if we wipe"
were simply ignored.  It was very frustrating, as anyone listening to me
whine in age can attest.

   I'm thinking that part of the problem might be the nature of the FV
server itself.  With a lower population, I think that more people solo
there.  Most of the people I was with were classes that can solo
reasonably well.  In the very first group is was like everyone was just
like doing their own thing.  I'm pretty sure that Lenny and I were the
only one's with /assist keys.  It was literally like grouping with true
newbies at orc 1.  I know that I am probably spoiled from duoing with
Lenny for so long.  We really do work together well most of the time. 
And doing that depends on communication.  There was very little in both
groups I was in.  It's also possible that I was just unlucky, I dunno.

  I want to go back into LDoN.  But I want to go with people who have an
idea of how to group.  Which means I want to group with either members
of a raiding guild (I am unguilded ATM) or with other agers.  So... I'm
waiting for you guys to catch up.  And I can group with Lentea with some
of you now.  For times when we aren't all on, I'll probably be playing
alt's on other servers.  I have a necro on Lanys, which is ok, but I'm
not really feeling the love with her, and I just created a Shadowknight
on Karana (so far seems fun).  If the SK gets up in levels (and if a
certain somebody wasn't just playing with me, it should) it will be
interesting to see LDoN groups she gets in when she gets older will tend
to be better than the FV ones.

   We do have at least 4 30'ish agers on FV, right?
