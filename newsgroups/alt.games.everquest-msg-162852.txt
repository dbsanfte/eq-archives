No faction at all.  Its possible that the person making the request has to be flagged
by talking to Mauvin, a prisoner on Death Row, but certainly others dont' have to.  In
order to actually get flagged for PoV you must have a mark and be Mauvin flagged, but
you can do that run once you have the mark.

Flags are sort of the PoP faction replacement, instead of laboring for days on end
mindlessly killing this or that repeatedly, you just talk to the right person and say
the right thing, or go do some specific quest or kill some specific mob once, and
presto, you are marked as having done that little chore, good to go.

Not that there's no faction at all in Pop, but there's precious little of it so far,
PoJ seems to have a couple but they don't seem terribly important so far, just that
its handy not to be KOS to either side so you can travel around safely.  (sentries of
justice, creatures of justice, I think they are)
