Nope, CoM is an example of really poor zone design for this. All of the
random loot can drop at the zone, and there is only one zone in.
So instead of there being several places to camp, there is really only
one, at the zone in. Ever see anyone go deeper in for anything except
the static reaver/quest drops? If those weren't there, how many people
would ever have visited the second floor?

And with only a single viable camp spot, the dungeon doesn't work for a
pick up group either - if the one group there is full, you are SOL and
leave. If there is noone there, or no healer, you are SOL and leave. So
sooner or later people migrate from there to a more crowded zone where
there are more openings in groups.

Chardok is the same, although that is apparently being changed on test
as we speak - anyone know the details?
