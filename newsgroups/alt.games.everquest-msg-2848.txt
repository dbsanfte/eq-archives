I know the hardest thing in the world to do is stand there and get a beating
when you are a caster.... but I play a tank and when I go to taunt a mob off
my caster, the worst thing he can do is run around like his pants are on
fire.   I was in various groups last night and found all the casters started
running around  when the mob aggroed them.   I would taunt or swing and the
mob would be out of range.

I can imagine standing there while your life rapidly diminshes is not an
easy thing to do.  After the battle, we discussed better tactics like don't
run... but if you are first grouping with someone, you haven't built up
trust as a caster that your tank would be there for you.  I can sympathise,
but my job would be easier If I could root the caster LOL.
