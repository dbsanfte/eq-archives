    In other, harsher, words, as long as the cash keeps rolling in from the
account they don't care. And the "integrity" of the game means nothing.
Blech.

    I knew that motives could be questioned, as the person in question is in
a rival guild of mine. That's why I gave as detailed information as
possible: so the GM could independently verify everything I'd said and come
to the same conclusion on his own. If a GM would ignore an account being
sold because he questioned why it was petitioned, even if the GM could see
that the account was a sold account, that's even worse than the apathy
above. This is actively working counter to the EULA.

    My server has more people trying to dodge reputation than yours, it
seems. ;-) Although the number of sold account name changes is up there,
too.

    I must have missed a step in there. What, exactly, would be a bigger
blow to game integrity than account sales? Why, when provided with specific
information which they could independently verify to prove to themselves
that an account had been transferred, would they fail to act if they meant
to support the validity of the EULA?
