That is true, the battles there are endless!  The problem is that most of
them seem to turn blue by the time I hit the mid-20s.  On my final night in
LOIO, I did fight right outside the chancellor's room in the long hallway
where there seemed to be an endless supply of Sarnaks with no time to rest
or med and that was fun.  But I really got sick of those pesky critters!  In
the Warrior room in Highkeep earlier, the battles were endless as well and
the Warriors and Guards were red and yellow respectively and exp seemed to
fly a lot faster.  I got lucky though with finding a group.  I intended to
sit and camp, but a shrunken Ogre invited me to a group without even asking
and I just followed him and got lucky.
