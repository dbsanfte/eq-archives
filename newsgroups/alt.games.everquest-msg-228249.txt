Exactly how fact-filled can one get in responding to "What a surprise,
of course they can do no wrong in your eyes"? A statement that implies
you have psychic powers to read my mind and know exactly how my mind
works via the Internet, which is rather absurd in itself.

But, then, I guess someone who doesn't even know how to post properly
wouldn't provide me fair competition in a real debate.
