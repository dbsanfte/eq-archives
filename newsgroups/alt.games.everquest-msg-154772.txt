This would be true if they "fixed" things by increasing the effectiveness
of AC by lifting the cap, without any thought to balancing things out.
What if they lifted the cap, but reduced the effectiveness of ALL
AC to a tenth what it is now?  OK, that would be a horrific example
of overcompensation, but my point is, it wouldn't make uber mobs
easier than they are now, would it?

Fixing AC would mean finding a formula where the higher AC means
something, but doesn't mean so much that it trivializes content.  The
current AC system means AC doesn't really matter all that much
for anyone, beyond a "does he have enough or not" sort of level.
And at the high end of the game, all melee classes are quite capable
of getting to "enough" levels.

A warrior would be even more needed.... and a third warrior would be
just as useless as he is now.  If nerfing monk AC means they can
no longer do what they do best, pull, then what they lose to is rogues,
who compete in their other arena, damage production.  Still, a third
monk will still be more desirable than a third warrior.

With groups, this is all well and good.  For raid purposes, you either
are the best at what you do, or you are taking up space.  When
you get to mobs that require 60 people, including people who
are 3/4ths as good as their counterparts means jacking up raid
size to 80... thats even less chance at the loot, and worse, thats
lots more lag... an 80 man force even of optimal composition is
often unable to do anything because lag destroys the CHeal chain.

Mages were the best at mana production.  You ask them to serve
as nukers... well they really aren't as good at that as wizards, so
why bring a mage?  If you fix them so their damage output is
comperable to a wizard.. then why bring the wizard?  Killing
mod rods means cutting one of the unique roles out of the game
entirely.  Fewer unique roles means fewer classes that are
"the best" at something.

Even the most casual gamer with a mod2 capable mage is hurt by this, previously any group with
a savvy mage and cleric was not going to have to sit around and wait for mana regen.  You don't
have to crunch numbers to know the difference between sitting around on your butt for ten
minutes waiting for the cleric to get back to FM after a difficult fight, and waiting one
minute for cleric and mage to mod/Cheal back up to be ready to go again.    Sadly, Verant's
"Vision" involves sitting around doing nothing a Lot, I suspect this is the real reason that
mod rods have been nerfed to hell and gone.
