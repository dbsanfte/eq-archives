At one time they had just such a thing howevr if you were not a pure caster
that could bind yourself then you were out of luck.  It was located in
Timerous Deep (I know I probably just spelled that wrong) and it was happily
called, the firepot room.  It was under water and there were several huge
jars that you could climb into that would instantly teelport you to various
spots in Norath.  Only real danger was a rare spawn of a Dragon there that
could take you out.  Pure casters that could bind started binding there.
Very cool way of getting around.  Then verant banned anymore binding in the
area.  I have heard tell that some of the original folks who binded there
are still using this system of traveling.  Just no new binds are allowed.  I
cannot confirm that of course.  The nexus is a huge leep forward for those
of us who play Warriors and others who cannot teleport on our own.  I would
go as far as saying that the Nexus alone justifies the SOL update to your
system.  Saved me a lot of time when I did a few of my crafted armor quests.
I was able to go over to GF and buy some gems I needed and then teleport
over to NK and get the stuff in SK.  Saved a bunch of time.

When I get to 50 with my warrior I want to start a wizzard.  If your desire
is to be able to have quick travel then play a Druid or Wizzard.
