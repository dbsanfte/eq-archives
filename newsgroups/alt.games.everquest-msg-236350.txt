I use a trackball to play EQ. What I want to know is what is the best to
controll EQ gameplay, trackball or regular mouse? Has anyone used both and
can give me some feedback on this issue for me. Sometimes while I am playing
EQ, I click on the bad guy and it dosen't seem to select the foe I am trying
to kill until I click on it for about 10 times. Which is not good for my
characters health, if you know what I mean. Any feedback is welcome.
