I had a level 4 DE necro ask me if I wanted him to start a guild, I figured
this was an alt char and considered it. He spouted oput the details and then
asked me if I wanted to join.

The whole idea wasnt all that bad, and eaven had a nice name etc....

soo heres wat he said next "ok I need you account login name so I can add
you to the guild"

I didnt bother continuing the conversation.
