Thanks. This got me back to a playable state, but I still want to mess
around with the settings a bit to see if I can get the best
performance possible. part of the problem is that I have no idea what
these settings do. The ? that you can use to point at various settings
is informative, if you know what they are talking about. For example,
what the hell is anti-aliasing? How would someone unfamiliar with this
stuff know what settings to use on their card?
