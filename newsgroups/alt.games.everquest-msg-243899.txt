Yes, a tribute master in PoK would certainly get more people to use it.
And I also take issue with 42's claim that none of the tribute masters
are hard to get to/from.  My Iksar tribute master is in East Cab, and
running between there and the PoK book is, well okay, only a few minutes,
but that's a lot more than the 26 seconds he talks about.  (And the PoK
end is a long way from the bank/nexus/PoT etc., so there's extra travel
there, too.)  But I agree, it's not THAT bad.

I actually lost my train of thought in my previous post, and wandered
down one path without making my original point, which was that there are
other ways to make it costly to turn tribute on/off, without making it
burdensome.  E.g., instead of making it awkward to go back and turn them
on, make it cost extra tribute.  Just to make up some numbers, if you
have a tribute buff that costs 1 per 10 minutes, and you turn it off,
you can turn it back on at a cost of 3 tribute from your pool, i.e. a
half-hour's worth.  So you won't bother turning things off unless you're
sure you don't need them for a full half-hour.

Of course, this could lead to characters turning on lots of buffs, then
turning them all off immediately, and turning on selected ones when
needed.  But you could block that by saying that, when you're not at
the tribute master, you can turn ALL your buffs off and then back on
(paying for an extra 30 minutes when you turn them back on), but you
can't turn off just some of them.  To change which buffs you have
running would always require talking to the tribute master.  (But on
the plus side, the tribute master could let you turn things on without
paying for the extra half hour.)

My point is, you can find another way to make it "cost" to turn buffs
off and back on, and you can tune that cost to make it as unpalatable
as you need to for play balance.  But if you don't give at least SOME
way that doesn't involve extra hassle, people will bitch about it and
a lot of people won't use the tribute system at all.

Now, before I leave the topic completely, I do have a related question
that I've been wondering about and don't remember seeing mentioned:
Does the tribute FT buff stack with FT items?  I don't have any chars
old enough to be able to cough up even 60 plat per hour for tribute,
but I could imagine paying 6 per hour for FT if it stacks.
