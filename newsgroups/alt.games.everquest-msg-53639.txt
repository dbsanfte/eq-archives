>1. What type of character is your favorite to play, and why. 

>2. What is the worst type of character/class to play in your opinion? 

1. Monk (why is listed below)
a. Not completely gear dependant. Monk's do very well with only a
small investment in equipment
b. Feign Death- A skill that allows you to play dead. This is like a
"Get out of Death" free card when it works
c. Mend- A skill that allows you to heal 20% of your total hit points
every 6 minutes.
d. Monk's can solo from leves 1-60 if they are careful when selecting
their hunting grounds.

2. Wizard 

Wizard's have to be the most challenging and frustrating classes to
play for a new player. To do well with a Wiz you need to be very
experienced with EQ in order to be half-way decent.
