I can sympathize. It's pretty daunting at first. My best advice would be to 
simply be on the lookout for anything better than what you have. Keep in 
mind what attributes you might like to concentrate on, and look for items 
of that nature. If I were to play a paladin, I would probably go first and 
foremost for better AC/HP, but if you're a diminutive race, then maybe some 
STR would be a big plus. WIS never hurts either.

As time goes by, you'll become steadily better-equipped. It also helps keep 
you enthusiastic about getting each little upgrade. There's a lot to be 
said for that.

As far as what you should have at level 12 goes, I'd say that any level 12 
should be able to easily afford to pick up level-appropriate gear in the 
Bazaar.
