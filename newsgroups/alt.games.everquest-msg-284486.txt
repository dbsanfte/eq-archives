I'm going to digress off your digression... I'm willing to concede
that it's quicker in WoW to level than in EQ.  You don't have to sit
in one spot and kill the same thing, over and over and over and ....

But, having played a couple of characters to high levels in both
games, I'm not buying the "brain and talent of an amoeba" bit.  Or at
least, I'd like some examples as to why you think WoW requires less
skill and talent than EQ.  I've recently gotten into level 60 raiding
in WoW, and the people I've met know the game, know the encounters,
know the abilities and spell lines and strategies, and are as smart
and capable as anyone I ever met in EQ.
