Ummm, they have, sort of.  I *think* it's Grieg's that spawns more and 
more mobs as you kill them, but not just in a single ring.  I know that 
when SoL first opened we couldn't believe that a zone so easy to break 
kept two full groups so busy for so long.

Nah, by the time a warrior has AE taunt, he's at least 59 with a ton of AA 
levels.  He should be able to engage defensive and ride it out.  If a 55 
is tanking these they're not THAT high level.  I see 60 warriors withstand 
the onslaught of two 62+ mobs in ToV fairly regularly.  Defensive, 
celestial while cheal is casting, it's doable.

There's a big difference between appropriate force and zerging.  If you 
have to fight several mobs simultaneously, and you can't mez or charm the 
adds, you have to find some way to deal with them.  Root-park or tank-mez, 
or hell, just chain-stun.  Something is bound to work.

Mobs won't summon unless you've done damage to them, right?  Just room 'em 
then.  I also don't think these mobs are *that* high in level.  If a 
single 55 warrior is withstanding the onslaught of 8 of them, they're 
probably not the type of mobs that summon.
