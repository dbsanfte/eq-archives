Odd, I use windowed mode all the time to look stuff up on the web.  I 
switch EQ in and out of windowed mode fairly often.  For a while there 
was a problem where EQ would just go black, but I have not had that issue 
for some time now, and never had mouse issues with it.  Of course, I am 
still using Win2k, and not XP.
