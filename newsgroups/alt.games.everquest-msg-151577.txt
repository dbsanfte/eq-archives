    If this is the monk I think it is (and please confirm if it is, Dan -
member of RIP?) then she got busted. Her guild loved her, because she was
their best puller bar none, but eventually she looted something she
shouldn't have from someone else. And unlike training, the GMs don't have to
be there to catch you for that. But she was great proof that it doesn't
matter how much of an ass you are, if you make yourself valuable to someone
they'll ignore what they see with their own eyes to defend you.
