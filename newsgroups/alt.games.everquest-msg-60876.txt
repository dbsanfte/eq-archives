Mid 30s, nice experience, but I have to tell you that there is
no way for you to pull em solo... so the spawn rate is unpredictable.
There are -lots- of people who can't pull spec's properly, and
yet keep trying, so cleanup detail worked out ok for me as a camp,
but then I'm the sort of guy that actually enjoys the thought of
rescuing the poor newbies like that.  The Feerot specs are much
easier to single pull, so they are a plan instead of an opportunity.

I'm afraid that I blew thru my mid to late 30s so fast on specs that
I really don't recall looking for anything else.  I wanted 39, and
a exp res, very badly, as you might imagine.

Also, other undead are going to be better targets for your
root and nuke strategy, due to the better nuke, but only specs,
that I know of at your level, are also so slow as to appear already
snared.

Here's another wacky strategy I've employed as a cleric, instead
of root or stun, try Flash of Light.  Extremely cheap and fast casting,
causes the mob to run around pointlessly for 18 seconds.  Fear
will make them run off like a man on a mission, and lasts long enough
to let them find help... but Flash, they never really seem to get all
that far away.  Flash and nuke before they get out of range, then
nuke again as they run in and flash before they get to you... or more
often you only get off one of the two nukes.  I call this strategy
Flashdance, although I've never seen anyone else use it, it can really
work well if you know what you are doing.  Used to hunt Tizmak
in my low 30s solo with it, while waiting for a group in Great Divide.
Here is another example of a low level spell being better than
the high level "improvement:" Blinding luminescence is slower to
cast (more time for mob to get to you) lasts longer (more time wasted
with mob out of range running around... and more potential for
it to stumble across help) and costs more mana.. when the whole
point of using it is to save even more mana than using root!  Only
use I can think of for BL would be in a duel.
