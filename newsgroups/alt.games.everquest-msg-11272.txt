Well, for one thing, hitting "A" (or whatever) again will turn
OFF attack, which can be annoying.  Instead, you can make a
social hotkey that says:
     /attack on

Then no matter how many times you hit it, you'll still be
attacking.

So why would you hit "A" twice or more?  Because it can be
reflexive to hit "attack" when you switch targets.
