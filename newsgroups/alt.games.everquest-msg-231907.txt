The difference is, what is considered fair.  Who decides that?  You?  If 
it takes me 5 minutes work to make 50 plat, and I therefor consider it 
fair to pay 50 plat for a lq cat pelt that would take me 5 minutes to 
farm, what is unfair here?  Better yet, I pay 40 plat for the pelt, and I 
have 10 plat left over yet from the 5 minutes of time I saved by buying 
instead of farming the pelt.
