I've done that on several occaisions in order to get epic drops for 
people, and even for my early pet focus items.  Turns out you can be in 
a raid with one other person, and both of you can be in completely 
seperate zones, and you'll still get out of TLC.  So a possibility would 
be to get in a raid with someone who is going afk for the night in the 
bazaar.

Good question, course it would be easy to answer by checking prices in 
the bazaar while standing at a vendor to see what they pay... except 
that this won't tell you if the gems are actually selling, just what 
someone who hasn't sold his yet has priced them at.  I'll wager if you 
put them up at less than what the vendor will pay you'll sell out quick 
(*but stupid*)  And I'd hope that if you put them up at less than what a 
vendor will sell them to you at they will sit a long long time (*but 
people are often stupid and even that might not be true, particularly if 
they don't show up on vendors much*)

A bazaar expert would be helpful here.
