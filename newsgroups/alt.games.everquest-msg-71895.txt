Which has always made me wonder...Elrond is a half-elf, one of the two chilren of
(if memory serves) Luthien and Beren. His daughter, Arwen, had a pure Elf mother.
Would that make Arwen a quarter elf? I mean, there is nothing two bit about her.

The irony is that the Elves of Lorien were all High Elves (that is, during the
Ages of Twilight, they left Middle Earth to live in the Undying Lands and latter
returned to Middle Earth on a mission of vengeance to retake the Silmarils from
Morgoth. Because they left the West without the permission of the Valar, they
were forbidden to return until and unless the ban on their return was lifted.
Galadriel was, I believe, the daughter of Feanor who crafted the Silmarils and so
one of the leaders of that exodus.) The Elves of Rivendell were mostly Wood Elves
or as Tolkien called them, Sindarin (literally those of the shadow ie elves that
never left Middle Earth and thus never saw the light of the Two Trees, choosing
instead to dwell in the shadows of Middle Earth under the stars before the first
rising of the moon and sun.)

And from what I've heard, they didn't include ANY of those wonderful songs, Elven
or otherwise! I want to hear Frodo singing "The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too
Late", dammit! I want to hear Bilbo singing the Lay of Earendil and listen to
Galadriel singing her farewell to the Ringbearer: "Now lost, lost to those of the
east is the Divine Realm. Farewell! May it be that you will find Valimar. Maybe
even you can find it. Farewell!" (http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/namarie.htm)

/em mumbles, 'There had better be a soundtrack with all this stuff on it.'

I may be wrong, but I don't think there are ANY Valar who make an appearance in
the trilogy at all, except as figures out of legend. Morgoth was a vala, but he
was cast out of Arda at the end of the First Age when the Valar came to Middle
Earth for the last time in a great war. Sauron, his lieutenant, was one of the
lesser powers, a maia, as were Tom Bombadil and the wizards.

I dunno, I think it would be pretty boring. Magic in Middle Earth is based on a
close understanding of the way things work (ie Elven magic, like those cloaks and
the Phial of Galadriel) or through long accumilated wisdom (ie wizard magic.)
Even the magic displayed by uber artifacts like Narya (one of the three Elven
Rings; the Ring of Fire was worn by Gandalf which explains his affinity for
fireworks, smoke rings and things that go BOOM!) is pretty lame compared to what
even a level 10 EQ wizard can do.

If it is the act of a traitor to speak out against the
unConstitional acts of my government, to excercise my
rights guaranteed by that Constitution -- the right to
publish my opinions and speak my thoughts, the right
to petition for a redress of grievances, the right to
be secure in my person and property against search and
seizure without due process of law -- then I am a traitor.
And God grant us many, many more traitors, for we are in
dire need of them.
