They'll only be around till tuesday I think.  There's also a fireworks 
stick quest if you want to do that, gotta get to it right away if you 
are gonna do it tho.  Go to your hometown, you'll get yellow text from a 
NPC there, go talk to that person to get info on the quest.  Warning ya: 
the clues you get don't help you much.  Look up the quest at allakhazam.

i think they spawn more than once.  Some zones are camped more than 
others so you may only see them once.
