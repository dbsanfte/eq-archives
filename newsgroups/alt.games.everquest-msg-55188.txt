I've tried to explain this about a dozen ways. The simple fact is that
"looking" at someone in RL is not at all similar to an EQ inspection.

Although I hate analogies, it's more like a stranger walking up and giving
you a wedgie to see the designer label on your underwear than simply
looking at you on the park bench.

I don't know about you, but if a complete stranger waddles up to me and
starts pulling my clothing in odd directions and patting me down to see
what's in my pockets, my first reaction is quite likely to be homicidal.
