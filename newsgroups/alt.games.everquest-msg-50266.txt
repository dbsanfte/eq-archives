Um, let me guess. You can't take your grannies spoons to the antique road
show? Come on, eventually everything goes down in price. If it is floating
around like the flu, of course it will go down in price. The only problem
with the economy is that people like you get upset that you can't sell your
wurmy for the price you paid for it months ago. Get over it. One final
question. Do you still pay $200.00 for the NES console? I was just checking,
cause I figured it might be that your economy is screwed as well ).
