But they are in ... well... churches.

Strip clubs are also places with lots of parking that are generally not 
in use during the day on tuesdays, but I don't see anyone setting up 
voting in them.

Course you might see an uptic in the male voting population if you 
did... and there's always the Chippendale crowd if you want to drum up 
women voters as well.

Thats beside the point, which is (IMO) that churches are special, they 
aren't -like- strip clubs or slaughterhouses or elementary schools or 
anything else you might personally find repulsive, they are specifically 
seperated from government by an act enshrined in the constitution.

ANYWHERE but a church, IMO
