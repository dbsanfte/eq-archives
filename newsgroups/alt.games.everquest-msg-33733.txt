You essentially screw most of the factions in Greater faydark, so

Nope, not really safe at all. Bigger ones can sort of get aggroed
from other people and you can find yourself beat down fast. 
You'd probably accomplish something though, but you'd accomplish 
far more faster grouped in the lake of ill omen if you have kunark.
These old semi cheap static camp small areas in the old world are
pretty gimpy by now and there is still often a line after you bother
to take the boat all the way out there.
