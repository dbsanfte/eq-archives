What is a spoiler site?  Do the Verant people really think we want to go
around hailing every single NPC in the game and doing every quest they give
us?  Do they think we're modern-day versions of Sherlock Holmes that can
deduce what these NPCs are even talking about at times?  Do they think
working on a quest for days only to find it is broken is fun?  Did I miss
somewhere in the game manual that said the following: The best way to play
EQ is being clueless.

When Anarchy Online went into beta4, AO Basher -- the best AO fan site --
had to be taken down due to being overwhelmed with hits.  Their bandwidth
costs went through the roof.  They couldn't afford it anymore.  They took it
down and then worked to find a way to bring it back.  AO fans wanted it
back.  And it is back.  And how it got back was simple and logical.  Funcom,
the makers of AO, hosted AO Basher on its servers.  Funcom scored major
brownie points with fans for doing so.

At a time when Sony/Verant should be doing everything in its power to keep
EverQuest the best MMORPG, not hosting Allahazam.com on its servers to keep
its full content and features available and free to all EQ players is
blatant stupidity.  Not only should Sony/Verant be hosting Allahazam.com for
free but they should be paying them $X amount per thousand hits it gets so
they will hopefully work full-time to make Allahazam.com even better.
Allahazam.com doesn't spoil the game.  It fixes it.  Enables us to know
what's broken in so we can avoid it.  It enables us to plan our time in the
game more productively so we can enjoy it more.  It levels the playing field
between the guildless and small-guild player and those that belong to the
mega-guilds.

Now the real reason Sony/Verant doesn't want to freely host EQ fan site is
very very likely simply money.  They don't want to foot the expense and like
mooching off of fans that love the game so much that they will ... for as
long as the fans can afford to.
