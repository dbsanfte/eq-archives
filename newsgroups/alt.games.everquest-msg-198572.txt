I've had a similar problem today, but only on The Seventh Hammer server.  I
logged on with my main three times in 30 minutes.  He is located in the
HighKeep zone, and every time the computer completely froze after about 1
minute of playing.  I tried logging in with an alternate character on
Seventh Hammer and it did the same thing after about a minute.  So I tried
logging in a character on Rallos Zek, and this time it didn't freeze.  I
then went to Ayonae Ro and created a new character which I played with for
over an hour and it worked fine.  But I fully expect that the next time I
log on my main again, the computer will freeze up.  Any clues?

Gordon
