/Rant on
Damn 6 hour patches that take 10 hours or more get my very very very angry.
No update message on website no apology, no nothing.I wonder how the US
players would respond if the same happened to them at a similar time of day.
It's also the Easter holidays for many so lots of peeps that have school
holidays or are home from work can't play either. It wouldn't be as bad if
they kept people up to date if they are having problems. No one should mind
if there are genuine problems but why keep us in the dark.
AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGJHHHHHHHHHHHH!
/Rant off
