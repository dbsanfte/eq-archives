Ive been a long advocate of having lots of spell slots, since continual
rememming of spells gets tiresome, to say the least. You wont get much
support here tho. Too many people who dont have this problem (because of
their class), and just like to see everyone else suffer.

Spell sets are one way this micromanagement can be reduced.
