Sure I've declined the offer... and regularly had to put up with 
indignant outrage from people who don't understand how come I don't want 
their 'junk'.

But that's me... there are a lot of people who don't realize that by 
accepting heavy twinking that they are effectively dooming themselves to 
a very long time with no quests that yeild an upgrade, no zones that 
yield an upgrade, no point to doing much of anything but hopping on the 
levelling treadmill to level up to the point where there is a point to 
playing again.

I've seen a number of these people who were enjoying exploring and 
getting those minor quest upgrades accept some heavy twinking from a 
'new friend' and after a few weeks on that treadmill, call EQ pointless, 
and quit...
