I have this happen on occasion with my necro.  Best I can tell is it
happens when the MOB pathing is jacked up.  You know, when they start
replaying the same path a couple of times only to pop on you a second
later.  When that happens my pet just kind of hangs out untill I get
attacked, which is usually when the pathing returns to normal.
