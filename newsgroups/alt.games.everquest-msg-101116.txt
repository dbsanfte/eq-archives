Not one-for-one, no. Several zones to an individual machine. Before
SoL was released, the combined worlds of Everquest required about 1000
machines:

Presumably the number is higher now, since SoL has a lot of zones.

And I would love to see the room where the hardware lives.

True, it's not that simple at all. It's that doubling, *plus*
additional staff to support the extra hardware, *plus* increased space
and utility requirements.

I don't run it, obviously, but I do run a business, which gives me
some practical insight.

And I generate plenty of my own bugs, thanks!

In fact, I *should* be fixing a couple right now instead of picking
fights on Usenet. 

Sigh.
