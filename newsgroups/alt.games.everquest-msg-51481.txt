My understanding of the damage bonus is it really doesnt start ramping
up to be significant till 45, and that the much lauded and criticised
Coplands shows it as pretty much outdamaging everything bar true uber
weaponry till around 52-53.

I think you may overestimate the power of the primary hand weapon
bonus at lower levels... Anyone here got any actual parsed data to
confirm that?
