The "replacement" being offered is worse than what I was wearing
previously, the gear I gave away to friends. Its 27ac, two
higher than the treeweave I was wearing in my 40's. Insane, crap,
stuff I wont use.

I'm left having to rebuy gear I already earnt twice before, and
it doesn't match any precendent Verant have set - rubicite,
lustrous russet, guise of the deceiver, hell even the LSoEE from
Luclin, in all cases the drops were nerfed and existing users
left untouched.

I had the BP, bracer and gloves. This is a major whack with the
nerf bat ;( Looking at having to spend 28k (which I dont have) just
to get back to where I was before I "upgraded" in umbal.

Damn.
