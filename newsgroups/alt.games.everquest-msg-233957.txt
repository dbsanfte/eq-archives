Another tip for MLing: I keep scratch paper on my desk for writing down 
how much cash I have on hand prior to starting an mission so I can 
subtract that amount prior to doing the /split. Often I ML for several 
missions in a row so have to remember to write this number down prior 
to each mission, lest I wind up splitting not only the take from
the mission just completed but also my share from the previous
missions.
