My reasoning: None of the songs that duplicate priest class effects
use mana. The mana-using songs/abilities AFAIK are charms (level 39
and 64 charms), an AE DD spell (Denon's Desperate Dirge), and Fading
Memories, which are definitely int-caster-like (charm from enchanter,
AE DD from wizard, FD from necro/SK). So I'd say it's pretty
reasonable for bard mana to be based on intelligence if we are to
compare with "regular" casters, more so than basing it on wisdom.
