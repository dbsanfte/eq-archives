A second cleric? Why would he be medding, why med with full mana?
Well, let's imagine you're right. How about 3rd or 4th cleric? They 
don't ALL need to med, do they?

In this case, when you already have one sponge, a second cleric is a 
better damage dealer than a second warrior, or knight. Still worse than 
monk, ranger, or rogue, of course, but noone is arguing about those :)

There's a shaman. In a group of monk, shaman and warrior, the healing is 
*covered* (if they are fighting low blues). To add to that, even if you 
ditch the warrior, it will still be covered (tried, it works). So you 
only need to add damage to make it quicker

If the person only cares about efficiency, and not people, cleric wins 
over warrior. Again, not over monk, rogue, ranger
