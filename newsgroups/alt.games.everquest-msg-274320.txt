At the moment I don't feel I need to do extra work as such.   The facts are
pretty self evident.   If can provide any kind of a citation for your
position - that pussy meaning coward derives from some sort of cat reference -
then we'll see about refuting that.  But as is, you've offered nothing but
your opinion.
