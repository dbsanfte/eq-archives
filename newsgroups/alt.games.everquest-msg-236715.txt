Ack.  Tacking on to my own post.  It's really aggravating to try and start a
group at *off times*:  There are a total of 5 people in the right range to do
an LDON:
One doesn't want to do LDON at all.  
One won't play unless there is a full group, so *3* isn't even a consideration.
One won't play if there isn't a cleric.  
One won't play unless there is crowd control.  
It is so aggravating.
