Whereas I think all LDoN had was grind, zilch content, making it the
worst expansion of them all. At least Luclin had some story and
history along with good zones (offset by its poor models and
unimpressive performance issues, along with the bazaar and shadowhaven
as negatives), and PoP at least felt epic for raiders, though the
mistake of having exp zones behind raid flags was a disaster and PoK
was an abomination. EQ was at its best through Velious. But it was
still darn entertaining through PoP. It was after that that the
negatives overcame the positives, and the scales tipped fast. LDoN
zones were abysmally bad, devoid of any character or imagination at
all, nor was there any story, other than the soon to be reviled
Wayfarers that almost everyone hates now. GoD was simply bad on almost
every front.
