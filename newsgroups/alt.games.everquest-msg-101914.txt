Read the full discussions on that page.

There are two Slansins.  The "fake" one gives the
"five faction increases, no decreases" when you give
him the Inert Potion you got from Toresian.

The "real" one gives a few ups and a few downs.

In all my trips to Erudin Palace (well over a dozen
times now), I have never once seen the "real" one, 
the "imposter" has always been up, and has given the 
desirable faction increases.
