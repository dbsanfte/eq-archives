I've been doing the beta test thing on the test server and have really
put this part through the rack. I like it. But your right, it makes
finding your way around stupid easy now. And as of yet there are no
pre-made maps. You make them as you adventure. This will change I
expect when it goes live and peeps make sweet maps and UL em to UI
boards.
The maps are zoomable using mouse wheel and labels are easy to add. A
little cross hair represents your posistion on the map and moves with
you. Once you have plotted your lables its a simple matter of watching
the map as you move and just head to known spots.

It is cool but personally I think SOE could just make a drop down menu
that you select where you want to be and let it warp you there. Almost
the same thing except you have to spend time to move to the location.

Anyway this is now a very diffrent game from 3 years ago.

Remember - It's just a GAME damn it!
