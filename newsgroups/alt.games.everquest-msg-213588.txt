Hail!

Thanks very much for the information. I today discovered the frogs in PoS
around the back near giant fort. They are pretty easy and was great xp for
level 60 3-5% per kill. Managed to get to 61 there today (medding there at
the moment).

I will have a look at the other spots in the coming days.

Regards
