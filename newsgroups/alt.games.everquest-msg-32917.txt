LOL!

I saw in the patch message today they're giving some more helms
graphics... which NPCs do the helm switcheroo, and which helms can be
made visible?

Speaking of patch, it seems staff of temperate flux is now main hand
only, Wonder where they got the idea to fix that? :)

*ugly thought about the heritage of dark elves*

It doesn't make sense, unless the Kobolds are a former Teir'dal slave
people and retained the language they learned back then. However, it
doesn't explain why dark elves would grow up with a basic knowledge of
elvish and elder elvish and have forgotten elder teir'dal. Elvish
should be the older language, unless the name for the entire people
was "teir'dal" before the split...

And, IMO, fixing those quests are more important than preventing high
levels from farming.
