It's not my opinion 'cause I've had a druid and enchanter for more than 3
years, but I'm THINKING their brain is chugging along the fact that the
"going price" of a port is 10p and they're offering a whopping DOUBLE that.

Eh for me I usually ignore CR begs unless I'm in Everfrost and they've
died...well, pretty much anywhere. <g>  I'm a little more generous if
there's no nexus portal around but I have to admit that anymore my thoughts
are "well, after THIS run they WILL remember to bind their butt closer to
the action!"  I'm mean...heartless even. :p
