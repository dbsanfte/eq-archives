Oh, please. Christians have no idea what religious discrimination is.
The first sign of criticism, and I see editorials in the paper about
how they're being so persecuted, and "I guess this is what Revalations
was talking about when it says we will be hated in the end days".
Boo-fucking-hoo. How many Christians have had to hide their religion
in order to keep their jobs in a country founded on religious freedom
lately? Or harassed by the small towns they live in when it's found
out what faith they are?

Wanna talk about religious discrimination?
