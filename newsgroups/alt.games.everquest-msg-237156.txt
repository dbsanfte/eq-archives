I think some of the desire to see the bst nerfed is more about petty revenge
than a real belief that they are too powerful.

The classes that have been nerfed for being too powerful are saying, wth!
look at them! I was never THAT powerful and yet I was nerfed!

But the world of EQ has changed, the bst would be overpowered if we were all
still in Velious.  But that is true of every class now...  People 1 group
encounters all the time that used to take raids of 18+

Monk pain comes from sharing armor and weapons with bst / druid.  we just
want that +wis +mana to get off our gear  =P
