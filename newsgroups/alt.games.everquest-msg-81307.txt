You need 3rd party for money since it cannot be dropped anymore.  The items
can still be passed along the same old way.  Find a very secluded spot <no
PC's or NPC's>, locate both old and new characters at that spot, old
character drops items on ground and then quickly log in other character at
same spot to pickup items.  Can be risky but works for me.  Only had one
time someone grabbed my stuff before I could log in other character.
