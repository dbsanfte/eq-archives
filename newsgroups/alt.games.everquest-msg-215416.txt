No, I would not ask. I know the reason.

You are an intractable moron.

Clerics keep people from dying. Period. Yes, Druids get nice utility 
spells, but you cannot beat the Cleric CHeal (Yes I know druids get a sorta 
cheal) at 400 mana for 7500 HP. Just deal with it.

Besides, 90 minutes vs 3 minutes downtime for a rez is not a big deal. With 
a KEI and some other mana regen (PotG, FT, kitty crack, whatever...) the 
mana for a rez is not that big of an issue(even less for epiced clerics, 
natch), and it is much faster to get a person back with the group safely. 
So what if the chanter is at 10m while she recovers from rez? Thats still a 
mez or two, which is enough to turn the tide in many battles.

Every time you have one of these bright ideas, I thank God you don't work 
in dev at SOE.

Yeah, we sure do. Now you can duel a few times with your casters, and they 
can build a nice stack of bodies. Drag one of them with you as you go 
through the dungeon. Then your epic Cleric can just run around doing a 
clicky on whoever happens to be OOM and Bing! FM, or 75% or whatever, with 
NO downside. Then after the fight the person runs back and grabs another 
battery...errr corpse.

Yes, so if you lose them you are screwed.

Maybe there should be a pause button, inc ase you lose the MT midfight? 
There are some fights that require an MT, after all.
