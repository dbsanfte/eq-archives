Does the recently introduced EQ trilogy come with 3 serial numbers, or a
single serial for each of the 3 packages?

I have a friend who currently has the base EQ, but is considering buying the
trilogy so that he can apply the Kunark and Velious upgrades to his account
(with existing characters), and then use the base EQ (that came with the
trilogy) account for his son.

Hope that made sense..

thanks
