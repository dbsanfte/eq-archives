I agree except for one good usb modem I have seen.  The Best Data 56k usb.
It only works with windows 98 (last I checked, 6 months ago), but back home
my parents computer always disconnected.  Hooked that thing up and it only
disconnects when you tell it to.  Half the time if you pick up the phone to
make a call it wont disconnect.  Was very impressed with that one.

As for the person who started this thread, you said your notebook computer
never disconnects, so ... buy that same modem for your computer! (brand and
as close to the same model pci or external version).
