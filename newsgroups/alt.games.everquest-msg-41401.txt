What, you didn't know?  It's only important if it 
happens in the US :p

And before somebody has a heart attack, I am NOT meaning 
to make this look smaller than it is.  It's horrible, 
it's evil, it's unspeakable - but what has bugged me the 
whole day is Americans discussing how things like this 
can't go on, and how the Fear Of God must be put into 
these people for the Protection Of The World - meanwhile 
ignoring the fact that terrorist attacks happen 
*elsewhere* in the world on a what, daily basis?  At 
least?

The speeches are starting to sound like that horrid 
Independance Day final speech. :/

Thank god there are still a lot of sensible Americans 
that I've been talking to that I can rant my head off 
too, and they listen and nod and say "there, there".  I 
need that when I'm ranting. :)
