I tried to get a stein of mogguk.  I got all of the components and gave them
to the bartender in freeport.  he gave me the book for clurg.  I gave the
book to clurg in wolfform and he told me to raise my faction and then he'll
talk with me.  That sucks.

I can get someone to do it for me or I can buy one but I would like to do it
myself.  Any ideas to raise that faction?  I've been thinking about the
bread quest but I don't know how many trips that would require.

Thanks,

Lewis
