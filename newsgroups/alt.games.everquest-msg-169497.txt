I routinely cast right back at them.  There are many outdoor terrain
features that do not affect LOS on the spells my characters can cast
(I would not be surprised to learn that bolts are stopped, certainly
arrows can be stopped by most anything).  One thing to keep in mind
is that, while PC spells are checked for range at both start and end
of cast, NPC spells are only range checked at the start of the cast.
Also, those gnolls have a pretty small "ah screw it" radius, it is
not difficult to be in the mob's range when it starts to cast one of
those slow DoTs (for instance) and by the time you get hit by the
spell you're not only out of range to cast your own spells, you are
so far from the mob that it won't follow you, makes pulling the
casters an exercise in frustration sometimes.

In summary:
1) The mobs' casting range only appears to be unlimited because they
are range checked only at the start of the cast (this was changed
back because it was trivial for players to exploit).  Keep in mind
that not all spells have the same range, if the mob is casting a
250 range spell at you you might be too far away to counter with a
200 range spell.
2) LOS is needed by the mobs just as surely as it is by you.  But
LOS restrictions do not always correspond with what you see on the
screen.  Most dungeon "terrain" blocks LOS.  Most outdoor terrain
does not appear to do so (arrows, and maybe bolts, excepted).
3) LOS checks for mobs are made only at the start of the cast, this
also is to prevent extremely trivial exploitation of the mobs'
ArtificialSupidity(tm) by the players.
