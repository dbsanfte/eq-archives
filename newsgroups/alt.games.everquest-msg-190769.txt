Hello,

Just created a new ogre sk on a fresh new server (one of the asian
servers still under beta ).  I need some expert opinion on how to get
some basic equipment for my fat guy, since I've never played and sk
before. Especially I need a magical weapon. I have about 50pp but for a
new server, 50pp can't get you any thing good from player economy, or is
it?

Thanks in advance for help.
