>> 2. tell them i'd give them a few pp for a stack of batwings (to this day,
 none have accomplished this feat) <<

I saw this the other day in Misty ... someone was offering 50 plat to the
first person to give him a stack of batwings, thne 10 plat for each stack
after that.

The n00bs responses? "Don't you know you can buy a stack for only a few
gold?"

I almost started collecting bat wings myself. (even at mid 20s, 50 plat is
nothing to sneeze at) It's my theory that little kids love little
characters. Try going to Butcherblock, won't take long for every dwarf over
there to start begging for something. Makes me cringe every time I go back
to my homeland.
