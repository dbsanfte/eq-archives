Bah.  Keep going with your original method.  You'll end up with a chanter 
with maxed melee skills (especially important is that Defense skill...)

If you're PLing there's really no reason to mess with mem blur at all 
until level 25 or so.  All your spell skills can easily be raised in a 
non-combat situation.  Summon pet, target pet, shallow breath, strengthen, 
true north, mezz, minor shielding, repeat last 5 steps as necessary.  Yes, 
even channeling will go up.
