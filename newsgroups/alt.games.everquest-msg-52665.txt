Spiders? Use a water pet Annie. They are resistant to poison plus they cast
a spell that does damage instead of the earth pet constantly rooting
something that does not need to be rooted. Just my opinion of course but the
earth pet's root is only good (at newbie levels) to prevent a mob from
fleeing so it doesn't gather friends, and that is usually only a concern in
a dungeon or other highly populated area. During combat your "nukes" will
break the root so what's the point?

BTW pretty bold of you to take on giant spiders at level 6 using pet
chaincasting tactics. The general consensus among mages is that chaincasting
pets is a 40+ tactic.
