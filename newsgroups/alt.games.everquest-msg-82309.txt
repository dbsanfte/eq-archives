I was with blueyonder dial-up and liked it so much I went to the broadband
as well. Jim's right - it's the dog's bollocks if you can afford it...

But their dial up is really good as well and I'm fairly certain it doesn't
have the cut-off. No idea if you can get it without having their phone lines
though.
