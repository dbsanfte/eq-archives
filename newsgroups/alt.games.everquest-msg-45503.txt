Heya guys... Well, to the point
I got a new comp about a month ago, AMD Athlon 1.4 Ghz, a Gigabyte
mobo(GA-77ZX-H), and an ATI Radeon 32mb Dual Display Edition(agp 4x)
It jams up every now and then, only in EQ. I got all my drivers updated and
installed right with DX8 and I've run the thorough file checker and
defragging my HDD... anyone else have this problem or a suggestion?
I can play Diablo 2 expansion fine, never jammed up, and thats about all the
DX games I play except for DX3 stuff.. I'm about to upgrade to Windows ME
hoping that will do something. Well, thanks in advance
