Well I haven't seen a log of archery without trueshot.   Would be nice to
see some logs of somebody who doesn't have a billion AA levels too, as I
still think its a very select few with all these archery skills (I know its
a very select few on my server, and were one of the oldest)

I think the main problem with archery (and i have a good friend ranger i
group with) is the "mobs toe touching a wall" bug where NO range items can
hit it.  Also, how do you get line of sight with 40-50 people surrounding a
mob?   (In a place like nToV, where you can't just wander off to find a nice
high spot)

"+20-30% increase in dps /hug avatar"
"Avatar has been parsed to increase overall damage output in the area of
25-30%."

What do you view as "better" than primal weapons?

From the same thread,  "You can't replace primal with anything."

"In other words, you would want a ratio of around 65/20 to make up for the
overall loss of damage from not having the Avatar effect in the mainhand and
for backstabs."

I rarely read monkly-business so I don't know any faster than you could find
one sorry
