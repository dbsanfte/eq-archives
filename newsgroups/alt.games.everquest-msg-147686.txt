   See, Larry, that's sort of the problem here.  

   Take a second and read the title of this thread you started.  Yes,
you were angry.  Ok, fine.  I've certainly been angry about stuff also. 
You came here and posted a profanity laden rant against the company,
because they did not put a MotD about 9/11.  You argue above that its
okay, since they are a company rather than an individual.  But really,
do you not think that the decision to not acknowledge 9/11 ultimately
made by a person, rather than a company?  And Larry, do you really,
really think that is was simply an oversight because they were too busy
sucking cocks to give a shit about 9/11, that no one in the company had
heartfelt discussions and ultimately made the decision that it would be
best for the playerbase to keep Norrath a place where they can escape to
a make-believe world were 9/11 isn't an issue? 

  Now people are calling you immature, and worse.  It's not because of
your military career.  It's not because they don't give a shit about
9/11.  Its because you came here, stamping your feet and swearing like a
9 year old who just found out that not everyone in the world thinks
exactly the same way they do.

   I don't know how much experience you've had with usenet, Larry.  I'm
going to be generous, and assume that you've never really followed many
threads posted to this newsgroup, or any other.  When someone posts a
topic, there a few different things that can happen to the resulting
thread.  It can stay on course, with reasonable, well thought out
replies that are on topic. This is rare.  It can meander along from
topic to topic, just barely staying in touch with the original topic. 
This is common.  It can abruptly switch topics, to something very far
removed from what the original author had posted.  This is also common. 
It can degrade into flames and childish swearing and name-calling.  This
is more common on some newsgroups than others.  Here, it is common.  Or
it can be elevated to a higher level of maturity than the author
originated by the replies of the respondents.
   Larry, the last is a theoretical construct.  I've seen many threads
degrade, but none, that I know of, stay on topic and elevate.  And
Larry, you started this thread about as deep down in the  mud as is
possible to do so.  You can denigrate others for the lack of maturity
they show when they post to you, but remember, they are following your
lead faithfully.  And it does not matter why, or to whom, you were
originally directing your infantile tantrum to.
