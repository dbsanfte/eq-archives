Has any one recently found a darned Shadow Wolf Paw?  It's required for
newbie Paladin armor, and I can't find the darned thing anywhere.  I've
killed hundreds of wolves (shadow, black, misty, etc) in Qeynos,
Karanas, Commonlands, Misty Thicket.  None of them has dropped a Paw.
I assume drops get cycled from area to area by Sony to baffle
players(?).  None of the areas mentioned (MT, WK, etc) in usenet/web
searches I've done has turned up a paw.  None at any vendors so far.
So back to my question:

Has any one *recently* found a Shadow Wolf Paw?

TIA
