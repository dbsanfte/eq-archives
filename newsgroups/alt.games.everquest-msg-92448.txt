As a player of a Halfling Druid, why is it that they are so despised ?  I'm sure
there is a history behind the snubs, I just don't know what it is.

As far as learning to play the game, Seth may be better served to try out a
warrior for a few levels as sort of a throw-away character.  That way you aren't
forced to learn spell casting on top of melee.  You can learn the game mechanics
using a character that may be more forgiving in that it will have more melee
skills and hit points (IMHO warriors are much less complex at least at the
earliest levels where most classes melee anyway).  Once you learn how to
interact with NPCs, how to configure your interface, how to buy and sell to
merchants, how to bank, how to equip gear, and all the mundane things that many
of us take for granted, you can then create (or stick with) a character more to
your liking.  I still have my starting character - a level 7 dwarf rogue on the
Karana Server.
