If you're really worried about it, you can have the store install
it...but if you're up for a little adventure, it's very easy and very
safe to do it yourself.  Once you realise how easy it is, you'll have
no second thoughts in the future.

here it is, literally:

You have the card, with it's very obvious "this part inserts into the
slot" part.
You have the slot, which is recogniably different from the others and
matches it's mate on your card.
You push the card into the slot.  Square peg -> square hole kind of
thing.  Like putting your credit card in the ATM.
There's a wire (usually red/yellow) with an end that matches a
receptacle on your card (the wire will originate from the power source,
the big thing with the fan that you plug the power cord into).
Download drivers.
That's it.  It may seem intimidating (and I've jacked my computer up
many times trying to mess with more complicated stuff), but putting in
a video card (or any other PCI card, or RAM) is wwwaaayyyy easier than
you would think it would be.

But, tinkering isn't for everyone :P  So, if you can afford the extra
change, go ahead and have the store do it.
