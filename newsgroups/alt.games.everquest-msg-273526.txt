I had just logged on but I didn't get to stay on for more than a few
seconds before I was booted out.  But right before I got the boot,
there was a server wide message that read (quoted from log)

<SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE>:Server coming down in 71582 minutes. Please plan
accordingly.

That is a lot more than 1 second I had before I was disconnected.  In
fact that is about 50 days.

Anyone want to try and /bug it when the server comes back?  And why
was it brought down?
