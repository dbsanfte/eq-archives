They said something to that effect. Single player housing 
will be pretty much like you describe, able to place various items
etc. It will be much more up to the individual's whims as far as
objects than the guild housing is.

Guild housing will be more like according to a plan, with various
upgrades or something.

"After that, I asked about housing. We all knew it was in the feature
list, but everybody wanted to know what was in it for them? The
benefits of housing. It was great to hear Bill explain that housing
would indeed provide more benefits than just looks. In EQ2 there will
be two types of housing. Player housing and Guild Housing. While
player housing will be open to everybody, and far more accessible, he
explained that Guild Housing would indeed have limited availability.
So yes, there will be a land rush for Guild Housing, it is meant to be
a rare thing, a prestigious thing even. It will be expensive, and hard
to get. The best spots will be the most coveted spots, and chances are
you'll know each and every guild who resides in those spots. Bill
managed to get whoever was running the demo, to take us outside the
demo for a few moments and show us an example of Guild Housing though.
I hate to drool in front of people, but damn, I was impressed. The
Guild Housing looks great. There will not be huge amounts of
customization to the Guild Halls, as opposed to the Players Housing
which will allow more character customization, but the Guild Halls
will be mostly unique, designed by the EQ artists especially for that
purpose. I know you all want to know whether you'll be able to design
your own guild banners, etc, etc, well I didn't think to ask. But I
can tell you right now the predesigned Guild Halls look exactly like
they should look. They are massive in size, and magnificent in design.
Immersion is something EQ has always managed to do better than most
other MMOGs and it does not look like they have any intention of
stopping with EQ2. 

 Just a couple comments on housing from OnyxRaven: It sounded like the
player housing would be more like apartments, where you have a virtual
room (or rooms) in a town that you can purchase. This means no
customization on the outside but you can do whatever you want on the
inside (Much like UO was when they introduced housing, except for the
land usage). Guild housing, on the other hand, is already built,
waiting for a deed to be sold to hand it to a guild. These are big
buildings, built in the style of the city. Some are much more
impressive than others, but I can imagine just obtaining a nice
guildhouse in Freeport is a big prestige point. No customization of
the outside (so that the look of the city is not ruined) but again,
the inside is ready for anything. Tradeskills will be used here on
customization, as they will be able to build things like chairs and
banners and such. 

As for Player Housing, and its benefits. There is one thing about EQ2
that is very different than EQ1, which is that storage is a valuable
commodity. You will not have the same ease of a universal bank that
you were used to having in EQ1. Because this is a big deal, it places
an immediate benefit on Player Housing, as it increases your storage
space. While this is the primary benefit of player housing,
Tradeskills classes will also be able to place tradeskill utensils
within their home, giving player houses but another use. Whether we'll
see more benefits in the future is yet to be known, but due to the
changed mechanic of storage space, the importance of Player Housing
becomes immediately apparent. There is the possibility, from what it
sounded, that traders would be able to open a residence as a shop for
people as well."
