    Hell, I think it's inspired. Imagine all the horror as the Iksar decide
that Kunark IS theirs. A roleplaying solution that works.

    Heh, he guessed wrong. It's amazing, if you think about it - VI usually
gives people who don't have a roleplaying bone in their bodies a roleplaying
motive for doing things.

    Good and Neutral are fighting PvP battles at every turn, and expect it.
Many are against each other. Evil is mostly PLing up, getting ready for the
day when they sweep out in a horde and lay waste to everything. The Newts
apparently have the numbers to be the more effective of the two PvP-active
teams.

    The change WOULD make evil level slower, too. There's things evil can't
use any more, like AoE anything, if they can hurt one another.

    So what do the Sullon players think? Muhtaq?
