I don;t know that I can agree... The peeps in Cali were pissed after
the rolling blackouts, and were REALLY pissed after the state's credit
rating hit junk status. Plus, The recall got enough petitions without
Arnie saying he was gonna run. 

But I DO believe that Arnie is the reason for the 70% voter turnout.
And that if he wasn't in the race, Bustamante might very well have
won. (Shudder)

Thge people were sick of Davis. The Republicans handed him the victory
by running a completely weak candidate in 2002. Davis didn't even get
50% in 2002, from what I hear.
