These are actually different than the skeleton armies. The ones I saw 
spawned (guessing here) at the chessboard in BB and returned there and 
despawned (saw this) even while engaged in combat. The Skeleton Queen 
seemed to have a huge regen, as the Rogue and SK that were fighting it 
never got it below 94% before it despawned. The SK was level 66, as he 
conned white to me, and the Rogue was Dark Blue.
