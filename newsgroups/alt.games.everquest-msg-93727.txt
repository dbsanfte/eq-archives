When I cast skin like wood on her, she runs around yelling "I got
wood", now I know no guy that would ever brag about such a thing. ;-)

When I go afk and don't tell anyone I'm libel to come back and have
her "painting my face like a street walker", guys don't handle make up
real well, having it put on or putting it on.

She'll pich your butt. 

Any sexual chance she gets for a rib or poke she'll do, you can count
on it.

In RL, she won't show her picture, but, it is other groups
understandings from people that have met her, she's a looker. ( she
claims her breast size is a D cup :-)  I told SR BAHAHAHA ) 

Now I don't know about others but I can tell you this is one beatiful
lady, even though we probably will be much much older before we have
pizza or coffee together one afternoon.

She can take a joke, she can give a joke and this board will be richer
for having her here. But, be fore warned don't ever cross her.

This ain't no guy, I'm glad of it.

Now run along SR and play the game before I slap your ass with a big
trout.
