In the last 4 years my office has had 3 harddrive and 2 mice failures
among our Dell PCs and Servers (roughly 120 machines). Dell builds a
VERY reliable machine.

I should have put "I" in quotes :-) There is nothing wrong with using
a Dell at home, as long as you are aware of the products limitations.
I build all of my own PCs. $ for $ it would be cheaper to get a Dell,
but I want to have complete control over what is inside my box.

For family members and friends, it would depend on thier PC knowledge,
and what they planned to do with the PC.

If they were PC "newbs" and wanted a PC for light gaming and
Internet/Email, then I would not hesitate to recommend a Dell, but I
would spec the box out for them to avoid *integrated components. I
would also make sure that they fully understood that a Dell is not
easily upgraded. Upgrades are really not an issue unless the user is a
serious gamer, but it is always best to inform people. Especially if
they are new to PCs.

If they wanted a gaming rig, I would point them to Alienware,
FalconNW, or build it for them myself as long as they were comfortable
installing thier own drivers, and were not complete PC "newbs". A
custom rig with quality components chosen for stability, compatiblity,
and speed (in that order) will very rarely need support as long as the
user isn't the type that tinkers with things and downloads every free
app they run across on the net :-P

Everyone I know who has purchased from AW and FNW have nothing but
good to say about either company. As far as I have heard they have
never needed any support. Both rigs are built with quality parts, so
it really isn't much of a surprise that they are pretty trouble free. 

*Not all integraded components are bad. The NForce2 chipset
motherboards come with integrated 6chnl sound, and 10/100LAN  . They
are fantastic performers. The sound rivals the SBAudigy, and the LAN
uses less CPU cycles than any add-in NIC on the market. It is also the
most stable chipset available for the AMD Athlon/Barton processor
line.
