IH4 head piece, but, I have FT2 head with decent stats from BoT, so, 
again, not something I want.  Also, given that my main heal spell is 
Quiescence, not terribly useful, plus, I also have Ornate arms with IH4 
for those times when I do cast my best non gimpCH, non HoT spell.  Haste 
of Mithaniel would be nice, but, not worth the tradeoff for me.
