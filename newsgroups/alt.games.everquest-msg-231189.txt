}luck at all finding the High Priest Shaman who supposedly drops the glowing
}stone band.  I'm pretty sure I'm in the right spot, room right next to where
}Lynada the Exiled spawns, but haven't been able to get him to pop and I'm
}getting zero exp so I think I'm gonna give up.

Hopefully the problem is not this simple:  The Shaman guy with the GSB 
doesn't spawn in the room next to the room Lynada spawns in.  He spawns 
next to Lynada in the SAME room she's in.

It would suck if you've spent hours camping the wrong room... I usually 
got a ring in about two hours.
