Voice Of Mary's Vision:
Hi! It's me...
the girl from the bus...
Remember?
The last tour?
Well...

Information is
not knowledge
Knowledge is
not wisdom (!)
Wisdom is not truth
Truth is not beauty
Beauty is not love
Love is not music
Music is THE BEST...
Wisdom is the domain
of the Wis
(which is extinct).
Beauty is a French
phonetic corruption
Of a short cloth
neck ornament
Currently in
resurgence...

And no sooner has she spoken (which is awkward and probably incorrect 
but what the fuck), enormous flabby short cloth neck ornaments obscure 
the horizon in a multitude, beating their ugly wings and working their 
hidden chrome snap attachments as they resurge in the direction of the 
White Zone seeking snack material near the Utensil Shrines of Greater 
America...
