Speaking from personal experience  I totally agree on IS and it's usage.
Very handy.

None the less, I have noticed that lately (ONLY lately, since NOV2003) the
CHA doesn't influence as much as it used to. I have done adbenture tonight
with no CHA gear at all (what ever comes with other things made it 132) and
none the less being 56 ENC in group of 57-60 I haven't got a paci aggro,
though ofcourse 2 mobs 57+ simply told me "unaffected". I did have to use
AoE Paci since most of mobs happen to be white/yellow. And that's from my
normal everyday CHA of 301 (yeah, I am weird I enjoy charm solo).

Just my 2 cents.
