Martin responded quite well to this, so I won't really bother, other than to
snicker at the lack of understanding.

I snipped nothing.   Hell, it's still quoted above at this very second.
Lets see, how did your line go?

Apparently reading comprehension is not your strong suit sir

In any event, that isn't what I was referring to anyways.    Say you're in
Hate, and you have a whole menu of different mobs mezed and in camp.   Which
one do you call assist on next?   (well, I know you would just F8 and call...
but which *should* you?)   A Spite Golem, two Revenants, a Scorn Banshee,
Kirakuei, Cleric of Innoruuk and a Haunted Chest.   Which order would you kill
them in?  (not just the first one, thats easy enough for even a druid to get.)

You have to maintain situational awareness to know what you have, and
understand each type of mob to know the order in which they should die.

Which is, of course, bullshit.    "Heal the person who is hurt"...  whew, I'm
exausted.

(Yes, I know it's a bit more complicated than that, but since thats the level
of understanding you're displaying about tanking, I figured I would return the
favor.)
