In other words, "running and telling mom".

We in the FANG have thick enough skin as to not let something as trivial as
what's posted on a public newsgroup drive us to insanity.  If A.G.E. were a
private news forum, I'd see things differently, but it's not... so I don't.

I don't know Zeppo, but if it's anything akin to what Matt Frisch has been
doing with his "Go away, moron" plastering, then at lest I have a reference.
I wonder if <his> ISP should be contacted?  Or does responding with a carbon
copy to written words that piss one off constitute something justifyable?

Not meant to be clever.  Just equating the mentality that apparently goes
into "tattling" on someone for posting to a public forum.  All that's
accomplished is crossing the line from the anonymous, unrealistic online
world and effecting the living, breathing world.

A real community, based in cyberspace, populated by (mostly) nameless,
faceless individuals who possess the ability to be whoever or whatever they
choose to be.  Sounds ficticious to me any way you slice it.
