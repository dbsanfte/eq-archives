There's no rule about this, but several factors apply.

1st, often when you think someone needs help, they are ok, or about to use
LayHands, or doing some other thing you might not know about.

2nd, when it is clear they need help (such as when they /yell for it) it's
fine to help out, if you want. it is totally up to you.

3rd, I have seen ALOT of people who take all their kills to the WC druid
ring, get it to 50% and then yell for help. They will then usually beg for a
heal or buff, go pull another mob and repeat. They are basically using the
characters there to Power Level them.

When someone needs help, I generally try to assist them. Times that is DO
NOT help:

When I'm grouped and my party needs me. Group comes first in all things. If
I'm grouped and someone comes asking for heals, etc. I usually say, sorry my
party needs me.

When its clear they are using me as a PL. I'll save them the first time, but
a second or third in just a few minutes is silly.

When it would be detrimental to me to help. Once, while passing thru WC, I
saw someone killing the guards at the toll booth, they were in trouble and
ran to me, asking for help. I did not help them, because it would have hurt
my faction in Freeport. I got a nasty tell from the person saying I should
have helped and responded "you came to kill the Guards of MY TOWN and expect
me to help? get over it"
