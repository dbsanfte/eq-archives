 I just started a dark elf necro. I have found POK to be a great help. It
has a bank and tons of merchants and you aren't KOS. There is a book in the
middle of nekulous for easy zoning and you can get some great buffs while
you are there. In addition it is accesible from most zones. Other than that
I've been using Neriak's first zone off nekulous (commons?) there is a bank
there as well.
