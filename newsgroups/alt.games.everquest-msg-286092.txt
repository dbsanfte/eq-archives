Invisible and inaudible doesn't help unless you can be invulnerable
to its spells, too.  Nothing like trying to change spells and getting
told you can't open your spellbook because there's some poisoned wine
on your cursor.  Or trying to target when some PCs have been shape-
changed to look like local mobs.

Heck, I don't think it was a jester -- I didn't see one, nor indeed
any casting message -- but last night in Acrylia Caverns my DE had a
heck of a time because *something* hit him with a Growth spell, after
which I had to duck to get through doors, blocked other party members,
etc.  Wish I knew what did that to me.
