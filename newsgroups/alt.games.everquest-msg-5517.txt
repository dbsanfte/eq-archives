We worry about that... or have in the past.  But the kids are already 
noticing the advantages of behaving like humans.  And it actually 
seems that the "envy" they once had for their un-disciplined friends 
has turned into something that's alomst pity.  My husband almost 
dropped dead of a heart attack when our eleven year old thanked him 
for caring.  I just didn't have the heart to tell him this was 
probably an elaborate scheme to get out of his punishment. LOL  They 
are still kids after all.
