There is no reason to test, charisma has nothing to do with faction.
An easy way to test it would be to have your troll sk  friend with 30
charisma base and full crustacean plate (giving him like 3 charisma)
who has never done troll sk quests in grob check his faction with you
making a new troll sk and puttin all points in charisma. They will
both be amiable.

This was all brad mcquaid said charisma was when he explained the
stats:

"Charisma: This affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC
merchants, and how much they will pay you.  It also affects the saving
throw on certain Bard and Enchanter spells (charms in particular).  "

They have the info over at caster's realm in each classes creation
guides. Usually the first sentence is what mcquaid said then they
embellish. Some of their embellishing is dated such as mentioning the
soft cap of 200 for int or wis (now its like 250 or 255, which is max
because of some 8 bit code thingie or something)
