Your right in thinking mostly your offensive spells you will only use to
solo, other than dd if you got extra mana in raids/groups you may toss that
in.  Turgur's Insects/Malo/Malosini/Focus/Sta/Canabalize/Torpor I would say
will be your most often and most needed spells, they are pretty much always
mem'ed.  If your looking for a real offensive character, shaman is'nt the
way to go really - we are pretty lethal offensively but in the overall
picture(read: raids ;)) your a support caster.

Your one of the most important at raids, I'd say top 5 easily if you wanted
to *rank* us....and you also do well alone.

Grinding as a Post-50 shaman is the greatest I have to say, you buff then on
inc you slow and then go afk till it dies 8P atleast thats how I got through
59 /snicker
