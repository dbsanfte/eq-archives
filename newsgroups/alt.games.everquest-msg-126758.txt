I have never had a bad experience with a GM, yet, but realize that they are
probably not the highest paid people in the world and probably could also care
less about individual issues.

If what you said happened, then undoubtedly, you are absolutely in the right
for being angry.  It has been my experience that the larger guilds have this
"we are bigger and can do what we want" mentality when it comes to camps and
kill stealing.  

The problem with the spawn points is that they are too consistent.  Spawns for
epics or quests should be static, thought maybe or maybe not in the same zone,
that way you wouldn't have just one spot to camp.
