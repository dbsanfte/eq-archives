I hear the sharpening of knives Andrew ole boy. 

http://xunleashed.dyndns.org:81/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2653

"What is XUnleashed?"

Some snippets:

"There are several plugins available. The standard plugins that come
with XUnleashed are a Macro Plugin, a Trigger Plugin, a Scripting
Plugin, and a Network Sniffing Plugin.

The Macro plugin allows you to record and playback keystrokes and mouse
movements so you can easily do some automated crafting, fishing, or
whatever in your game. 

...

The Scripting plugin is a very advanced plugin that allows scripts to be
created using VBScript. These scripts are pseudo programs that can do
some very complex logic to manipulate your game or even run the game for
you. 

The Network Sniffing plugins is for those adepts that want to see the
actual packet stream to their game. This plugin will dump out a log for
their reading pleasure."

And, from the EQ plugin specific thread you linked (yes, *YOU* linked)

"more detail.

There will be a map tab that shows the map that we are all familiar with
(ie, DU). There will also be a mob tab that has all the info about a
mob. Ie, ac, hp, drops, etc. 

The mob tab will be on the plugin itself, but will have an option to
bring it up along with the map at the same time so you can minimize it
and still see the mob data for targeted mobs.

So, if it actually works, not only will it give you the same data that
ShowEQ does, but it will allow advanced scripting and macroing too.

Explain to me again how this isn't a cheat?  I'm sure you'll spend the
next 3 or more months thrashing and babbling about it, but anyone with
a clue can figure it out in about 2 minutes of reading.
