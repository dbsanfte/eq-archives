No, it doesn't.  Go test it.

What's the relevance of fighting dispelling mobs?  He's
asking if he can leave the first slot open to leave a
place for a spell *cast on him* to land where *he can
dispell* it without having to go through his own buffs
first.

Pot, kettle, etc etc etc.   Maybe if you actually
understood the question he was asking it would help.
Which part of "Well my point was having the first buff
open so if you had a root or something cast on you it
would be in the first position so the cancel magic
would "kill" the first position spell" didn't you
understand?  Or did you just not follow your own
advice and read what he posted?
