Think you missunderstood, he wasn't upset over not playing EQ on a server,
he was upset over not grouping with his friends on that server again.

You not ever passed an old haunt (night club, bar, skatepark) where you used
to hang out but no longer do? Then, remembered all the good times you had
there, all the friends in passing you made that you now, don't see anymore?
Same thing, just on line, it may be only a game but the people who play are
real, that's why connections are made.
