I'm sure that real melee players can give you more details, but the key to
your paladin's troubles is his "low level" status.

At levels under 20, your damage is "capped" at 20 (well, I think high
strength can add a point here.)

I believe there are more caps, but that one is the most crippling.

A simple rule of thumb is that you should look at the damage/delay
ratio of a weapon, the higher that ratio the more damage you will
do per minute (which is generally far more important than how
much damage you do per swing)

However, due to the cap, no weapon should be considered
higher than 9 damage for the purposes of that ratio until you
hit 20.  This means that the (lets say) 16/32 weapon you gave
your pally is really pretty much a 9/32 weapon, albiet one that
hits towards the high end a little more often.

While it looks on the surface like a 8/24 weapon (.3333 ratio) would
be inferior to a 16/32 one (.5 ratio),  under level 20 that 16/32
might as well be a 9/32 (.28125 ratio) one.

As you level up, though, that 16/32 weapon will look real good
for a while.  Then you'll start (at level 28 I think) to get a bonus
per swing.  This means that your 8/24 becomes a 9/24, 10/24,
11/24... while your 16/32 weapon goes up much less, 17/32,
18/32, 19/32.

Faster weapons also taunt more.  Mobs hate you based not
on how much damage you do per swing, but on how many
times you swing.  If its your job to get and keep aggro, then
you want a fast weapon even if you do less damage per
minute with it.  Contrawise, if you -aren't- the designated
target for some reason (say you have a higher level tank
and he's been damage shielded) then you may wish to use
a slower weapon even if you don't do quite as much damage
with it per minute.
