Amen.
Last year in EK those same 50+ were killing greenies and auctioning off the
looting rights to people who were of the appropriate level for the no drop
goodies. EC was full of werewolves, but a 20ish char didn't stand a chance
of getting one, they were all down with a single nuke from the farmers. Even
the ones you'd already engaged.

I only managed to get a Girdle of the Holy Wanderer because the player the
mage was holding it for didn't make it, and the corpse was about to rot. She
was kind enough to flag me down and offer it gratis.

As a rule I disaprove of the trivial loot code, but for special events I
think it's warrented.
