Ping localhost. If that won't ping then the driver is not bound to
your network card or you have a bad network card. That can happen with
Windows that a driver can get corrupted. If that is the case you need
to reinstall the driver. To do a complete reinstall of the driver,
turn off your computer, remove the network card, turn your computer
back on, remove the driver, turn the computer back off, reinstall the
network card, turn computer back on and reinstall the driver. If that
doesn't work then you have a bad network card.

Hope that helps.
