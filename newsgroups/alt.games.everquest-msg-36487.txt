<snip dying stories>

I'm starting to get the impression you die enough for it to be a problem
with character advancement.

I hope you won't mind one more suggestion on where to hunt when. How are
your factions with the Karana Residents?

Really, if it was me considering your luck, I would be hunting scarecrows
around the Miller farm in WK. You can kite them a bit, tainted breath/SoW to
get them down on health a bit before you nuke and melee them a bit. Nothing
likes scarecrows AFAIK, no adds.

There is no loot worth mentioning involved in killing them, but you should
be able to get close to a level a long <~6 hour> night. There is a werewolf
in the area and "The Swarm", kind of a rare spawn that shouldn't be in
exactly the same area.

Kill scarecrows to level 22 anyway.
