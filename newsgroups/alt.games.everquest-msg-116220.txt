I'm going to have to call "Bullshit!" on your claim that his products
generally suck.  I will go so far as to agree that Win 95 and 98 were crash
prone and irritating to use.  Windows 2000 NEVER has crashed on me.  And as
for Excel and Word, the competition -- back when there was some -- were just
not up to scratch.  I well remember going through Word Perfect documents
with all control characters showing, just so I could delete hundreds of
pairs of "Begin Underline-End Underline" codes that some stupid ass had put
in there.  The codes being put there is obviously not the word processor's
fault . . . it's just that it represents one of many shortcomings of that
program that MS Word did not have.
