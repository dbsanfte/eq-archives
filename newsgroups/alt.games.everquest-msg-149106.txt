Slashdot links to a NYTimes story about how "l33t" speak is showing up in
schools, with kids using "u" and "r" in homework, not even realizing they
are doing it, because they are so used to it from instant messaging.

I don't use those in IM or chat, but I *do* use them when sending text
messages to cell phones.  With a limit of 130 characters on the message
length, the savings does make a difference--I'd rather replace "you" with
"u" and "are" or "our" with "r" and keep a clear sentence structure and
word choice, than write a bad sentence to make room for "you" and "are".

I suppose it is time to concede on this one: "u" and "r" will be accepted
English in a few years.  However, I see no reason to give in on things like
"0" for "O", since those don't save anything.
