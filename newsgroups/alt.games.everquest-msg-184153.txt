The way you speak of skill is nothing more than memory.  In physical skills,
it is muscle memory.  That's the key to a good golf swing.  Training your
muscles to make the proper swing for each club.  However, even in golf,
there's more to it than just making the proper swing, as that's only the
last step in the making of a stroke.  Once the muscles are trained, the
setup for the stroke is the really critical issue.

The fact is, even if Phil Mickelson hits the ball as well as Tiger Woods,
Tiger will usually beat him.  That's because Tiger plays smarter than Phil.
(Phil could have played the lead in Tin Cup).

So, back to EQ.  EQ is a role playing game, and physical skills are
minimized.  Therefore, the key to the game is to develop the mental skills.
Those skills are organizational and tactical in nature.  You set a goal to
complete some task, then line up the necessary resources to accomplish it.
Without knowledge (skill), you would not know what is needed to organize the
task.  Without knowledge, you wouldn't know what tactics would be most
beneficial.  For example, we recently read here of a mage/enchanter that
summoned/charmed a pet/npc that could only be hurt by magic, then used that
pet to defeat non-magic using orcs.  My wizard, of course, would never have
thought of that, but there's no denying that tactic is a learned skill, and
one to be admired.

Of course, while EQ is not a twitch game, it is a real time game, which
means that you have to develop the ability to apply memory to tasks in a
tense, real time environment.  This is different from the old Wizardry
games, where all you had to do was save regularly.  If you screw up your
critical assignment as part of a team that has been camping a certain quest
for days, you will not be entrusted with that role again.  Therefore, you
have to apply your skill (knowledge) to the successful completion of your
assignmnent, even if that assignment is as leader and assigning others to
their tasks.

Cheers,
Eric
