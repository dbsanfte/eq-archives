heh, no you don't know the 90percent, because there are multiple uber guilds
on all servers.  The few on your lone server is ALL that you know.  And you
know what?, with the know it all attitude you show on these boards, I bet
there is a reason why most guilds probably won't take you.

See how you change the subject so fast?  You just stated the Raid channel
was overrated and not needed.  I gave you an example why a 50plus member
raid in a high content zone is very much needed because it makes forming
groups, and communication via large quantity of members that much easier and
efficient..

Nice sidetrack.

Remember Noob,  PoP=Raid channel.  No one can hit 65 for this short period
of time, along with dozens of AA points efficiently without the uber xp in
PoP zones.  Old level world there is ZERO high level zones to efficiently
grind to 65 and amass aa points.

Now just goto bed, put up that picture of Brad McQuaid and polish it up real
nice, and just STFU.. hehe
