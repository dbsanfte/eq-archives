Shaman doesn't need them either.  I am fairly certain that a Druid would not
need them either.  The Cleric, well, he would be ignoring the SGs, and
soloing spectres probably instead.

Admittedly, with a group, more SGs would fall in less time, and overall xp
would be better.

With the Paladin, a more appropriate target for the two of you would be
undead creatures, like, for instance, spectres maybe.  The Paladin can fear
them, then you two can whack on them from behind.

Trying to take down an SG with just two melee is tough, at least until it is
green to you, possibly even then.
