Not only that, but I'd much rather be able to /auction a bunch of
stuff that's sitting in my bank account, then just withdraw it
and hand it over if I get a buyer, than carry everything out to
EC in case it sells, then carry everything that didn't sell back
to the bank (or alternately, have to run to the bank to pick up
anything that found a buyer if I left it all in the bank while
I was /auctioning).

Similarly, it's nice to be able to just reach into the bank
and pay for something that you see for sale that you'd like,
instead of either having to carrying a huge pile of plat
"just in case", or run to the bank every time you wanted
to buy something that exceeded what you happened to have on
you.

But as you say, using FP for those conveniences unfortunately
makes it hard to find buyers/sellers that are of races which
are not welcome in Freeport.

Rumor has it that Luclin will have a dedicated "auction zone",
which includes a bank friendly to all races, and teleportation
portals.  It's long overdue.
