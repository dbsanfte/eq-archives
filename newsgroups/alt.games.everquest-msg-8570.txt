You have completely missed the REAL reason to this nerf. 

Velious was set up so people HAD to make a choice between one of three
main factions. Dorfs, Giants, or Dragons. No longer would everyone be
doing the same things. No longer would everyone be able to get the best
of everything. You had to research the different areas and make a
DECISION on which faction to ally with. Ally with giants, you'd get
better armour, but no dorf ring quests for example.

This was one of the KEY features of Velious, and presumably written in
at a very early point in development. The trouble is, the highest level
guilds found it trivially easy to swap factions at will by killing
opposing leaders. Complete a few dorf rings for the guild, kill the Dain
a few times and everyone could now do the Kael armour for the tanks. A
few more high level giant raids, and it's off to Skyshrine to kit out
the casters. Need more coldain rings? Raid Tormax or Yelinak a few times
and the Dain loves you enough to get some more rings. 

This went totally against Verant's 'vision <tm>' of Velious, as yet
again, they underestimated the players ingenuity. This 'nerf' was put in
to re-establish what was originally intended. It hurts regular players
slightly, but hurts the faction switching big guilds much more. If
you're of a level to be completing Kael armour quests, you should be
able to raise faction to Ally easily enough. Hell, the armour quest guys
aren't even on Tormax faction, they're on regular giant faction. Get a
group and do Icewell, or farm green dorfs for heads and you'd be 'Ally'
before you can say 'nerf'
