  Strange, perhaps it's that at level 16, your pet can deal up to 20 points
of damage per hit barehanded, the same as with a rusty halberd.  However,
since a rusty halberd is twohanded, if your pet had dual wield capabilities
(and I know it doesn't) then it wouldn't be able to wield another weapon
because it's already got a twohander.  So maybe it's some sort of
safeguard... if natural pet damage is equal to or greater than the damage
being delt with a twohanded weapon, they will not equip the twohanded
weapon?

  Just a guess.
