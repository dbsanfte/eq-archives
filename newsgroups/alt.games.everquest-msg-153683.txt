Velks is usually so overpopulated that single-pull is the rule, unless you
go to the tents/pits camps.

Personally, I'd -love it- if the level restrictions were extended to group
spells, if for no other reason than that I could wander around in peace
without some level 10 sending me /tells begging for KEI.  It's gotten better
lately with the KEI whores hanging around in Nexus, but I still get tells
from people asking me to come KEI them.  Worst one was from some guy that
struck up a conversation saying that I once helped him out months ago with a
bunch of questions, and could I please come to Paw from Shadowhaven and KEI
his group?
