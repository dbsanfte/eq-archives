As I understand it from someone who used ShowEQ, it is Level+5 in that
formula both for your level, and for the level of the groupmates.  There are
other factors as well though, zone xp modifer, and number of people in the
group, which both modify the MobXP value in your formula.

Formula is L(X): (X+5)/(sum(group levels)+5*groupsize)*(mob
level^2)*zem*group bonus
zem = zone experience modifer
group bonus = 2% for 2, 6% for 3, 10% for 4, 14% for 5, 20% for 6 or (1.02,
1.06, 1.10, 1.14, 1.20)
not 100% certain on the group bonus values
The group bonus is designed to encourage grouping by awarding a larger bonus
for additional members in the group.  Each individual member still gets less
xp per mob killed than if they soloed the mob, but, given that generally, a
group can kill more mobs in a given amount of time than the individual
members can soloing, the members end up ahead on xp over time.

So, given a zone with a 50% xp modifier, and a group of 25, 27, 30, group
modifier is 6% I think for a group of 3, and a mob that is worth 625xp (mob
base xp is level^2, so level 25 mob), you get:

L25: (30/97)*625*1.50*1.06 ~ 307
L27: (32/97)*625*1.50*1.06 ~ 328
L30: (35/97)*625*1.50*1.06 ~ 359

97 = (25+5)+(27+5)+(30+5)
