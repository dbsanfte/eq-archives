My advice is the opposite. As a newbie (I've only played the game for 6
weeks), I remember being up to my arm pits/flooded with basic
tradeskills supplies that I sold to merchants for copper. Okay, I've
made level 29 with my main in this time, but this was by neglecting
tradeskills. I can now see why you make the above comments.

It is very boring running around any zone killing greens to harvest
stuff later on. Far better to level your trade skills as you level your
character. If you know your next creation/skills in each trade, you just
collect the ingredients for your next recipe as you go along.

It is only at higher chr levels, when you have neglected trade skills,
that it costs big PP because you decide to buy your needs rather than
harvest (very boring and not every harvesting site has a fishing spot
{:-(.  Buying trade supplies is worse than buying weapons in the bazaar.
