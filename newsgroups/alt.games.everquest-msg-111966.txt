On Wednesday, May 8th, at 2AM PDT, (9AM GMT), all servers will be
brought down for a scheduled patch. Due to the nature of these
updates, we do anticipate additional downtime to occur. Most likely,
the servers will be coming back down briefly after they are brought
live for all players. Therefore, the initial downtime we anticipate is
8 hours. Once the servers are up, the next 4-6 hours could see several
smaller patches applied which would require the downing of all world
servers.

...hey, at least now they're admitting the patches may require
re-patching. ;-)
