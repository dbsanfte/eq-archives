I've died right after leveling more than a few times in some rather bizarre
"flukes".  I attributed it to the fact that 30 seconds before all my skills
were maxed, and now they aren't.  Produces fizzles for casters, for one
thing, and while it may just be perception it really seemed to have an
impact on fighting ability in the lower levels.

Though I agree that those are the ones that are going to be most clearly
remembered.  :)
