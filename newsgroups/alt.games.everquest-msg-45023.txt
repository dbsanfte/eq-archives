I don't have one yet. I want one. It may be a fair bit before I'll be
taking down the forager and hunter so I can do the quest. My question
is, until then, can I still hunt the spectrals in EJ? Or will I be
trashing my faction with the quest Mob making me unable to get the key?
I had one person tell me bad faction hits would just make it more
difficult to get *to* the quest mob, but another said I wouldn't be able
to do the quest and be SOL for getting the Seb key. What's the deal?
  I primarily ask because the spectrals are just a perfect level for us
to hunt right now.
