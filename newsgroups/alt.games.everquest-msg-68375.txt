These people with hair color differences... how many of them are due
to them having used /facepick?
A guildie of mine used to be the blonde barbarian with horizontal blue
stripes. After using facepick, her old style face is the carrottop
with red swirls. She hates it, but no matter what she does with
/facepick, she can't get her old face back.
