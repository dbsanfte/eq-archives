As horribly shitty a game as it is, Final Fantasy XI Online had one nice
feature where the mob's name would change color if
A) It was engaged
B) It was engaged and the person fighting it had asked for help.

Nifty little feature and I don't imagine it would be TOO difficult to code
though I do imagine there would be issues with people running through a zone
like DL and getting smacked by something and getting the accidental riposte
on it, but that would be rare.

Ah well, a troll can dream I guess.
