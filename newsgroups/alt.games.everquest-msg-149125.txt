You can't rely on any one news source totally and basing any argument using
a blatantly political biased news source is a complete and utter waste of
time, whether it be socialist or conservative or the dreaded Strawberry Ice
Cream Party

I think that was the point of them quoting it to you there Dan - it's easy
to see the political machinations in the "other side" but much harder to see
the same going on in your "own side".
