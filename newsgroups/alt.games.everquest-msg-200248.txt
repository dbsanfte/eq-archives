Grin.  I ran into one of those too.  But that just proves that idiocy knows no
level.  Most of the KEI givers I run into are very nice.  They thank you for
the donation.  They remind you to click off the old KEI.  One guy even reminds
you to put *some other buff* in your first slot.  Very good business practices.

I always give the GOOD ones a hug and a smile before I run off.  Unless it's a
*woman*.  Then I just bow :)
