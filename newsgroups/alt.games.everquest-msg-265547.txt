The issue is with the drivers, EQ does not officially support the 61.77
drivers, and I was using them in the past with the same problems and more,
the game would lock up randomly, and such.  When I used the live tech
support system, the guy told me I had to upgrade my drivers because I was
using outdated drivers.  Well, of course that was not the case, and the
drivers he said were supported don't work with the 6800's.  I am afraid that
until they resolve the issue, anyone with a 6800 card will see similar
problems.  If anyone is running this card, in any config (6800, GT, Ultra),
and isn't having problems, let us know what you are doing differently.
