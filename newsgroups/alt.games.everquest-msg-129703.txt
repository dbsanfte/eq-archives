Oh, yeah - like my mage needs criticals when my water pet
can outdamage a 55 ranger (before he epicced), and my DS
was doing as much damage as a 45 warrior.  So, before I 
nuked I was doing the same damage as the 2 melee's in the 
group - no way a wizard with some miniscule chance to crit
can even come close to keeping up with my sustained DPS in
an xp group.  Basically crits are eye candy, and little 
enough for wizards to have.  Lord, you sound like the idiot
brigade that got booted off the Magician's Tower because
they were to whiny even for that group.
