My guess is:

 4. ALL OF THE ABOVE

Most servers are at least 2-3 years old. Imagine all of the snake
scales and rat ears turned in over that time. The EQ economy is
growing (eq mudflation) 24/7, and items never wear out. The only
"expenses" players have is food and drink. Spells/gear are a 1 time
purchase.

Months ago (before the caster AI changes) my 53 monk could solo/clear
SolA and net 500-1000pp a night in drops using summoned bags and
selling to the goblin merchant in the zone.
