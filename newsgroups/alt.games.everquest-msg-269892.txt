It's more than just the exploring aspect. It's a sense of world. When there 
are no PoK books, one tends to spend a little more time in the zones around 
their starting area, for instance. I think this creates a more appropriate 
atmosphere of actually *having* a home city.

Also, they will spend more time in whatever area to which they may travel. 
It detracts from the immersion when I can just snap my fingers and be on 
another continent or even the moon and immediately zip right back again as 
a low-level warrior.
