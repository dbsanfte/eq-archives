Happened to me twice today (several hours apart) on Cazic-Thule.  Both times
I was zoning Between North and South Kaladim.  I'm in Tennessee on
Mindspring/Earthlink.

I'm actually glad to see your post ... I had just installed SoV, and was
hoping that it hadn't flutched things up for me somehow (not that I'm jaded
or anything <g>).
