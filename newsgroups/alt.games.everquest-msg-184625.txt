Dont let tanks pull on half health, because youll have to heal them early
when they return and cop a load of agro. Try and work it so they get healed
just before combat ends.
If you are going to get agrod, then stand next to the monster so the tank
doesnt have to locate and chase it to regain agro.
   (That one is a favorite of my enchanter)
Dont heal necros outside of combat unless they ask.
Dont melee mobs and then request time to med.
Announce your heals with party messages (Use hotkey macros).
Either call your mana at the end of every combat, or just say youll warn
them if youre low. Having to repeatedly ask the cleric for mana status
shouldnt be necessary.
