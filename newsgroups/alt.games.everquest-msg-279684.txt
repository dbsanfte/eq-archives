The whole passing stranger thing happens infrequently enough to not 
matter. This is especially true if you step off the beaten PL-track and 
venture into zones etc where few people tread at all.

Getting the odd sow or temp or ds isn't going to somehow pervert the 
experience. Its simply a non-issue.

I'm failing to see the issue here too. Ideally you do things yourself or 
with like minded individuals (ie within the guild). If no one can do it 
you go without... that's the point. Hiring some 70th level necro to do 
your spell combines defeats the purpose. :)

Its true that everyone will approach these questions differently... even 
like-minded people are rarely perfectly parallel. But there is a 
distinction between ironman (accept no help from anybody) and simply 
adopting a D-I-Y "philosophy".

Ineed.
