I don't know if the guildy stole it or wrote it, but she passed on some
"new" spells that Verant is going to be releasing...one of which will
automatically cast SoW on people who "Hail" the druid at druid rings, a
great time saving spell.  A similar one for enchanters/clarity.
(disclaimer, this was a joke post)

Depending on the druid/guild/whatever, I'll either cast C/C2 on a druid then
say "<so&so> may I have a sow, please? =)" (I really should make that into a
hotbutton) or I'll ask first, see if they'll give it to me because of my
manners, then I'll cast at LEAST C/C2 on them (usually more).

I say "depending on" because there's some very thoughtless guilds on Zeb
that I wouldn't help unless they paid me up front.  Followers of Nobility
(only their guild leader is worth a shit) and Lone Wolves of Norrath(?) pop
immediately to mind.  Realm Powers is near the top of my list as well...huge
higher level guild (many 50+) but they'd have a total raid wipeout trying to
fight their way out of a paper bag.  And they have manners to match their
fighting skill.
