Hi,

Does anyone in this group know the formula to calculate a Wizard's 
maximum possible defense cap per level?

I found a formula on one of the Everquest web sites for this, is was
supposed to be:

(level*3)+3

But I have found that this formula appears to be incorrect.

According to the above formula, at level 39 a Wizard's maximum
possible defense skill would be:

(39*3)+3 or 120

But I have a level 39 Wizard with a current defense of 130, so this
predicted value cannot be right.

After asking around, I found another Wizard who is level 42, and
they have a defense skill of 139.  According the the above formula
their maximum should only be 129.

So the (level*3)+3 formula does not appear to be right.

I did some checking back through the records that I have kept for
my Wizard.  I have records of every defense point that he gained
(on each level) from level 14 on up to level 39.

He had always gained 3 points of defense, (and no more) each time
he leveled from level 14 onwards.

And I found that his maximum defense skills at each level, were always
higher (by 12 points) than what they should have been according to the
formula that I mentioned.

Here are the values that I have from my records and logs:

level 14   55,56,57
level 15   58,59,60
level 16   61,62,63
level 17   64,65,66
level 18   67,68,69
level 19   70,71,72
level 20   73,74,75
level 21   76,77,78
level 22   79,80,81
level 23   82,83,84
level 24   85,86,87
level 25   88,89,90
level 26   91,92,93
level 27   94,95,96
level 28   97,98,99
level 29   100,101,102
level 30   103,104,105
level 31   106,107,108
level 32   109,110,111
level 33   112,113,114
level 34   115,116,117
level 35   118,119,120
level 36   121,122,123
level 37   124,125,126
level 38   127,128,129
level 39   130

I have only gotten 1 point in 39 so far, but I should be able to
get up to 132 according to the figures that I have.

But my maximum defense at each of these levels exceeds the values
predicted by the formula (by 12 point each time).

If I were to continue to project my figures for the rest of the
levels (up to the 145 defense skill cap) and assuming only 3 points
per level, it should read something like:

level 39   130,131,132
level 40   133,134,135
level 41   136,137,138
level 42   139,140,141
level 43   142,143,144
level 44   145

Notice that the Wizard who told me he has 139 points at level 42
also falls within the expected range.

I wish that I had kept records for my Wizard below level 14, but I
did not.  But I know that my records from 14 to 39 are right.

So it appears the the (level*3)+3 formula is not correct.

Can any other Wizards provide any further data on their defense
values at various levels?  I am curious about this.

Can anyone provide their Wizard defense data that confirms my
values? Or exceeds/disproves them?

My Wizard is an Erudite with the following base values:

Str 60
Sta 80
Agi 75  (70+5 of my starting points)
Dex 70
Wis 83
Int 142 (117+25 of my starting points)
Cha 70

I created another Wizard with the same stats and class, then tried
to see how many defense points I could get at level one.

The formula that I mentioned, said that I should have been able to
get 6 defense points maximum at level 1.  (1*3)+3

But I could only get 5 points.  (And no higher despite over 300
more misses, and many, many hits)

So I leveled the test Wizard up to level 2, and I immediately saw his
defense go up to 6 during the very first fight)

The only type of formula that I can come up with, that comes close to
predicting the defense value maximums that I stated above is:

(level+5)*3

So at 39, the maximum predicted would be:

(39+5)*3 or 132

Strangely enough, this formula correctly predicts all the data I have
included from my records from level 14 up to level 39.  

It would be different at lower levels of course.

Do Wizards get 5 points of defense for a few of their lower levels,
until they start getting only 3 from then on?

I wish I had kept track of my defense from the beginning, but I only
started at 14.  I do know that the data I have supplied from 14 on is
correct.  He got 3 points each and every level.  Up to 130 at level 39,
and I am guessing he can go as high as 132.

Can any other Wizards out there, at varying levels, provide some of their
defense skill data, so I can compare it to the values that I have listed?

I am curious about this.  What is the correct formula?

It is weird that (level+5)*3 (the formula I came up with) seems to back up
all of the data that I have for levels 14 through 39.

Again, these values (listed above) came straight from my records.

Can anyone confirm my figures?

Best Regards,

 - Mike Dorr
