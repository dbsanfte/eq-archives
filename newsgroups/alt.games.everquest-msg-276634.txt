1) I didn't know that you had arrived at your final conclusion, I
apologize for offering alternative suggestions.
2) I didn't say that proximity wasn't the issue, in fact I stated that
proximity is a much more important issue at low levels and that the
issue was probably *proximity*, her level, or her meleeing.
3) Why do you assume that he has only been killing undead?  Undead make
up a minority of the mobs in Shadeweaver's.  His log happened to
include a lesser shade.
4) I offered a number of suggestions based on the information I had and
taking in to account the information I *didn't* have.  You made
assumptions.
