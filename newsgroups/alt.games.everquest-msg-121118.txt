That's simply not true.  Some of us have jobs were we do have to be
*generally* available during our "off" hours.  I have to keep an eye on the
company mailing lists at work, for example, when I'm home, because I'm one
of the senior developers, and have to be available to help out the junior
engineers.  Sure, I can go watch a movie or go out for dinner, or things
like that, and it is no big deal, and I can disappear into EQ for several
hours for a guild raid every week or two.  What I cannot do, though, is
disappear for several hours into EQ and ignore mail *every* night.  This is
the price I pay for having a flexible schedule that doesn't require me to be
at the office whenever anyone else is working.

If I didn't have a second computer to get my mail on, I'd have to give out
my home phone number.  Yuck!!!
