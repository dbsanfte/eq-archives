My view of DN was one wall for most of the time. And if I took my eyes
off those red lines on the right, horrible things happened. There's
nothing worse for a cleric to see "Your target is out of range" because
the mob ran off and everyone is chasing it, and you don't know where
they went. When you get up to run after, the adds jump on you.

I am not an adrenaline junkie. I really wish everything that was needed
for tailoring and cultured smithing would drop off under level 20 mobs.
I'd just do that. Really, I would.
