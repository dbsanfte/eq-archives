I've been hunting with groups in LOIO at the fort for a couple levels now.
Mind you I'm only 22 but I usually group with people older than me ( 24-28 )
and it's always packed during the peak US times.  I play on Terris-Thule
between 4pm and 11pm pacific time.  I see high 20's, low 30's there all the
time.
