Yeah, Tormax is easier for your guild to kill than mine.

As to the Prince and the number of enchanters, it's quite true that a 58+
enchanter wouldn't really have any trouble being the sole enchanter, but for
lower levels they tend to be annoyingly resistant.  Not impossible or even
HIGHLY resistant, but definitely annoying.  Mezz is often enough resisted
that lots of people better have Root ready, 'cause you're gonna get pretty
badly beaten if you have to stand there trying to mezz them again.

Of course, with the recent patch the point is pretty moot.  Enchanters will
be killed very quickly with the 1-2 punch of a high level nuke + high level
melee ability of most critters.
