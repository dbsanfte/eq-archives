Woot.. thanks alot jaZZ!
I have been meaning to look for this info for some time now but never gotten
to it, and suddently it is delivered right here in the NG.

Now i am thinking what to do about actully daring to put the stuff into the
tome/book/lexicon/whatnot and start trying to get those
spells..  What have you researchers done? Did any of you actually start at
16 or until you reached lvl 17 and gotten 5 more points into
research skill (lvl cap for lvl 17 is 21, right?).
Or do you wait longer and give more "room" for practice research or loading
trainingpoints into it?
