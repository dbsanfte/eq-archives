You're getting beat on. :) Seriously, if the mob is hitting you
with melee attacks, you're the one with aggro. (I qualify the
'melee' because you can still get hit with certain spell attacks and
not have aggro.)

Not real sure why people have to ask who has aggro though. It's
pretty obvious by watching the HP indicators of your group. The
one that's going down is the one with aggro.
