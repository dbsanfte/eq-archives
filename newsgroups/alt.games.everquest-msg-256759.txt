You might want to start up a magician. At fairly low levels they can 
summon zero weight 4 slot 100% weight reduction no rent bags, lots of 
bandages, & stacks of throwing daggers. All good for monks. Just log
off your monk in a quiet place & have the mage drop them there, then
log the monk back on & pick them up.
