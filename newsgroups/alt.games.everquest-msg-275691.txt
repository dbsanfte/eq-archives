Could it be because WoW is just like the games that went before, only
more polished and faster paced, perhaps?  There is very little in WoW
that is particularly new and innovative, as even the WoW developers
themselves admit - the goal was always to make an Everquest-style
game, only "better".

And of course SOE will steal ideas from WoW - that's how progress
happens, I steal your ideas and you in turn steal mine.

You mean like the sewer trials in GoD, where you had to go through
(Qimini and Barindu?  Not sure about the zone names)?  Ok, so perhaps
WoW does it better (wouldn't be so hard), but the concept is there
already.

Like the Coldain ring and Coldain shawl quests from Velious?  Assuming
that's the kind of progressive you mean.  The only progressiveness I
saw in quests in WoW[1] was "Now that you've done my quest, why don't
you talk to <some other NPC> to get a new quest", in which case I
think there are quests even in original EQ that would qualify, except
you can bypass the earlier stages in most cases.

[1] I played my night elf to level 8, so my experience may not be
representative...

You mean like the dragons in Kunark and Velious?  The ones in Western
Wastes are a bit of a pain to get to, I'll admit, but Wuoshi was if
anything too easy to get to. ;-)

Maybe it's just that WoW is so much like EQ?
