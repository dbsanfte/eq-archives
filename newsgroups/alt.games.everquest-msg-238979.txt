No, it is not.  The drops for the necromancer epic are rare. (Slime Blood in
particular.)  The stats are mediocre.  There are drops from ToV that are in
my opinion better than the epic.  The right click effect is pretty much
useless.  It takes too long to cast (9 seconds) and embracing darkness,
aside from having a much faster cast time, is a better percentage snare (65%
vs 75%).
