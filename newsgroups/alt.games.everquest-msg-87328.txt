I doubt that any of the online game people will ever make as much of a hash
of their patches as Verant have over the last couple of years. Id like to
know what the emergency is, that warrants bringing down all the servers at
prime time. The servers have all been up quite a long time (fair while since
the last patch), and they couldnt wait another 9 hours? I guess we'll see in
the patch message, but it wouldnt be the first time the servers have been
brought down for trivial reasons. I remember another "emergency" patch
(about a week after SOL), where only cosmetic changes were made.

On top of that, Ive seen some pretty blatant mistakes made with some of the
patches (bugs). An example would be the permanent leaving of monsters
corpses (24 hour?) with that infamous player-mob patch. Didnt anyone notice
this, or they did didnt put 2 and 2 together and work out that the server
would be littered with corpses? Thats just slack testing, and Ive yet to
hear a good excuse.

Its amusing how many people will come to verants defense on these issues,
regardless of how much they have botched it up in the past. The mistakes
have been made... you cant argue them away.
