    Hello everyone.  I started playing everquest about a month ago.  I've
been wanting to play it for a while and after seeing the Tri Pac, I went
ahead and got it.  I hear that the new add on will be good so I'm also
planning on getting that right when it comes out.  I've been a big Final
Fantasy and Baulders Gate fan "among other rpg's.  Anyone here of Earthbound
for SNES?"  This game is so big it just blows me right out of the water.
There is so much to do in this game.  Sony really knows how to make a great
role playing game.  So, anyway, I have a couple of newbie questions that
hopefully will be answered :)

1.  I've went through 2 characters and I'm now on my third one.  I have a
human wizard and I feel like this is the one that I'm going to spend many
hours on getting him to level 60.  When will I be able to bind with the
wizard and about binding, can I bind at any spot or only in cities.  Also,
when will I be able to transport "I know that only certain classes can do
it, that's why I have the Wizard."  How does transportation work, do I have
to buy a spell for each city or do I just transport my self by clicking on
some map and it takes me to that spot.

2.  How do I make money.  I know that killing creatures and selling the
looted items can get you money.  I've seen people collecting this gnoll
teeth "hope gnoll is the write name" for some sort of minnie quest for money
or some sort.  Is there a way to get a job doing things or something.  Also,
where and how do I go on a quest for someone or something?

    I guess that's it for right now.  O yea, just for you all to know me
better you can call me by Noah "my first name" and I'm a 17 year old "! all
most 18 in December !" male.

Talk to you all later,
Noah
