This is true.  A group of us got our howlingstone keys because we knew that
it would be mostly empty.  Which is was the two times we went there.  But as
a previous poster stated it is BYOG.  And you pretty much HAVE to have a
porter to get the melee types out unless you plan on doing the whole dungeon
including the boss mob to get out.  This is because it's a linear dungeon.
So you have to do it in order.  There are four halways and you have to get
to the end of each to find a key for the next one.  And the keys are no
rent, so you either have to get them all over again or leave a corpse there
every time.   And just GETTING to HS is a pain in the butt.
All of this makes it a dungeon that is only for the truly dedicated.  Which
is why it is so empty even though so many people have keys.
