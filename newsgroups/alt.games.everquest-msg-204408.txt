Ok, first the obligatory *drool* for the nice tradeable armor that has
entered Norrath.

Second...yes, you saw this coming...is this stuff chain graphic, and does
anyone know if the helm has a graphic?

OH, heck, and if anyone knows at what point a shm/rng could duo the nobles
area where this loverly stuff drops, I wouldn't mind that info
either. :) chances are I'll have another ranger friend and/or cleric buddy
to come along, but if I know I can duo a spot, the rest is lagniap
(sp?).  (I'm told this zone is a great place for me to test out whether
I'm ready to tank in PoP.)
