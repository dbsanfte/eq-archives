	I would just like to point out to anyone who might be tempted by this 
bullshit:

	a) I have been playing EQ since 2002 and haven't seen anyone use ANY of 
these 'exploits'. Either they are complete bullshit, or used to work and 
haven't for a long time. Sony give priority one to exploit-fixing and 
will even make elements of the game unworkable to prevent players from 
using an exploit while they fix the underlying bug. I *have* seen 
several other (real) exploits in the game over the past three years, all 
of which have been fixed.

	b) Using any one of these at any time is sufficient grounds for Sony to 
BAN YOUR ACCOUNT, which they will not hesitate to do.

	c) none of these are particularly useful anyway. In terms of obtaining 
gear or experience, none of these stupid abilities are worth taking the 
risk of losing your characters.

Kind Regards,
James
