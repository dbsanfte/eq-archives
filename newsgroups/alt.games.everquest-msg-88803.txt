That's the easiest part to get, actually.

Go to the Faerie camp in Lesser Faydark and start whacking Faeries
(of any/all type).  They drop the Faerie Dust quite often, and
unlike a lot of other stuff in the Ro quests, it's stackable.

Just be careful not to get too many on you, or more than one
Faerie Guard at a time, they can get nasty.

Note that the Soil of Underfoot which results from turning in
four (*unstacked!*) Faerie Dusts in Kaladim is Lore, which means
that you can't just turn in all your Faerie Dusts while you're
there and get a big pile of Soil of Underfoot -- you have to
make a round trip from Kaladim to the Temple of Solusek Ro
for *each* piece of Ronium you want to make.  If you try to
make two Soil of Underfoots at the same time, the second
turn-in will fail.
