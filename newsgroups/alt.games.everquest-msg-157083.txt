I use ZoneAlarm all the time.  It's free for personal (non-commercial)
use.  Never had a problem with it, and it stops a *lot* of stuff.
Just checking...  55 attempts so far today by outsiders trying to
touch my machine (ping, ftp, telnet, whatever).

I also periodically check my system by popping out to www.grc.com to
use ShieldsUP! to run a quick exterior scan.
