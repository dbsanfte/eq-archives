I do sometimes ask Shamans for a buff via /tell.  The only one I ever
ask for is Spirit of Snake.  If they say they can, then I go to them,
get it, and always offer to pay.  A 10-plat casting of SoS might save
me 10 Plat on each stack of smithing supplies.

(As far as SoW goes, if I've got it, I've got it.  If I don't, I
don't.  It saves a bit of time, but it's not an absolute necessity.)
