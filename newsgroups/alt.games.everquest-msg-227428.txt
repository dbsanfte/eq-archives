Just make sure your necro knows his stuff if you do CoD, certain mobs
(even at zone in) are unslowabel and hit for over 700. Tight corners,
roamers and nasty mobs sprinkled in make it a pretty hard place to duo
until you figure things out. Odds are it won't ever be camped and it's
good exp so it might well be worth it to you. Min lvl to get in w/o a
flag is 55. The other zones you'll need to be 62 to get in, those are
Halls of Honor and Tactics. I'm forgetting one that nobody ever seems
to go to (NightmareB?).

Check out some of the new dungeons, especially if you're after loot
more than exp. Veksar, revamped Droga, ChardokB. The first two you
have to get away from the zone line to get to the decent drops but
they're easy to get around in, ChardokB can have nice drops right at
the zone line from random named (and I really wouldn't advise going in
any deeper).
