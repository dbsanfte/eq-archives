    I've already seen someone propose the one way of doing it: individual
level XP multipliers. So for example, in level 45 all XP earned is
multiplied by (random numbers incoming!!) 1.5.  Then in 46, 47, 48, 49
multiply all XP earned by 0.8. 45 goes faster, 46-49 go slower, with a bit
of tweaking total XP required from 45 to 50 remains constant. Since the XP
loss levels are also well-known, individual tweaks to XP lost could be done
the exact same way.

    What all this really means is I'd better get my necromancer's butt in
gear and get her to 30 before the patch. Six and a half yellows to go! (All
the other little people are already sitting in a hell level, ready and
waiting to go.)
