Yes.

I cancelled my account a couple years ago, and they continued to bill me 
for 3 months. I contacted them repeatedly and was advised they had a no-
refund policy even though I had cancelled the account, but they would be 
happy to properly update their systems so I wouldn't be billed again.

I wrote a polite letter to my credit card company requesting that they 
cease accepting charges from SOE and reverse the last 3 charges as they 
were not authorized by me and were essentially fraudulent.

I copied sony the letter; I got my money back promptly.

ymmv.
