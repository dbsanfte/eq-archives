All this in, what, 48 hours since the patch?

Purleeeeese...

How many PSCs have you seen sold over the last few weeks in order to
make that claim? Probably just did a bazaar search and saw one unsold
PSC for 16k. Here's a clue, maybe it's unsold because the seller
overpriced it, and the one for 6k had sold 5 minutes before you looked?

As for the fungi, and changes to monks would have negligible effect on
the price. Any monk who could afforded 60k today, could've afforded 40k
last week. Any monk who could've afforded a fungi for soloing, would've
done so last week. It's stupid to suggest otherwise. Changes to monks
have nothing to do with the desirability of a fungi to a monk. Changes
to monks have nothing to do with the desirability of a fungi to a
warrior, rogue, ranger, shaman, or any other number of classes who can
wear it. It certainly wouldn't cause a permanent 50% price rise
overnight.
