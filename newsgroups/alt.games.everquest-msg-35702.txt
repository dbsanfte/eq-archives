Why have the media refused to report this story? How many more White people
has she murdered in the past two years?

Malaika Tamu Griffin is wanted for the murder of twenty-five-year old Jason
Horsely. In early 1999, Griffin was a tenant at a neighboring home to Mr.
Horsely and his girlfriend, Deborah Loiselle. On April 20, 1999, on their
first encounter Ms. Loiselle was threatened by Ms. Griffin who expressed
anti-white animus and stated that she would kill her and kill her dogs . Mr.
Horsely and Ms. Loiselle are white and Ms. Griffin is African-American. Ms.
Griffin continued her tirades against her neighbors despite the fact that
there was no actual provocation.

On the evening of May 18, 1999, Mr. Horsley was assembling carpentry tools on
a public sidewalk near Ms. Griffin's house. After Ms. Griffin verbally
castigated Horsely, Ms. Loiselle entered the argument. Both females returned
to their residences and Jason resumed his work. Shortly thereafter and without
warning Ms. Griffin returned to the sidewalk armed with a laser-sighted 9mm
pistol and shot Mr. Horsely in the back at point-blank range. Mr. Horsely died
minutes later from a fatal heart wound.

While in immediate flight Ms. Griffin encountered an acquaintance who she
proceeded to carjack at gunpoint. Ms. Griffin drove to Iowa and proceeded to
board a bus to Chicago where she was last seen.

A police search of Griffin's Denver residence uncovered a cache of ammunition,
diffused hand grenades, a 9mm assault rifle and manuals popular with
terrorists including The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Poor Man's James Bond.
Police also found notebooks with Griffin's opinions about a coming race war
and the necessity of killing white people. None of her colleagues or close
friends ever heard her express the types of racist rhetoric she wrote in her
notebooks.

Ms. Griffin has a BS in Chemistry from Jackson State University where she
graduated magna cum laude. She has experience in production laboratory and
chemical research settings. Ms. Griffin's primary area of expertise are in the
analysis of organic compounds by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
using ultraviolet and fluorescence detectors and ion chromatography for the
determination of anions in air and water. She has also worked in pharmacies.

She should be considered extremely dangerous
