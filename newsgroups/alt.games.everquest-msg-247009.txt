The original root (imho) seems to be as good as the higher lvl versions. 
  The primary difference is the time the root lasts.  Longer lastinr 
roots are  better for crowd control, but if you have a competent puller, 
the nornal root will work fine to keep the mob off you til your tank 
gets aggro or you get to the zoneout, or heal or whatever
