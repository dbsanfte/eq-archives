My favourite dungeon at this level is Nagafen's Lair. The Kobolds run
from high blue to yellow, with the named, such as in KPC conning red,
but manageable. I have pulled the King a few times, his harm touch
does about 3.5 bubbles damage. Average drop is 3-4 pp. Lots of fine
steel and medium bronze, as well as a couple decent items off the
named in KPC. Typically, I will get a couple yellow bubbles and
100-150 pp in a session.

One of the main reasons I like going here is there are almost always
groups, at least on the 7th hammer. Unfortunately, most groups in
here, even fighting normal Kobolds, are level 40+. This is thanks to
the play it safe mentality beaten in to players heads, thanks to the
exp loss from dying. Perfect example, I dinged 36, had two blue
bubbles in, died, got a level 39 rez, and still was two bubbles from
re-dinging. That just sucks.

Anyway, when you can get a group here, the exp and coin is great. A
good idea is to use /anon or /roleplay when you zone in, and check
who. If there are already a few under 40, you can admit your level.
Otherwise, remember you can get exp grouped with level 52, so a bat
group is also an option.

A good idea to check on your server is the /who all command. At least
once a week I will do a /who all 32, /who all 33, all the way up to /w
ho all 40, to see where the players my class and level are hanging
out. Unless I can find several bored friends online, Kunark dungeons
are all pretty much out of reach, as they never have pick up groups.
