There is, you can usually find a few hanging around at most port
spires/druid circles.

10 plat, anywhere in the world.  Might cost you a bit extra, I sure as
hell don't port to Iceclad for anything less than the 100plat the res

That's silly.  Just find your local druid/wizard portwhore, no silly
level restrictions, an almost universal flat fee of 10 plat per port.

Offhand, I'd suggest looking a bit harder for places to hunt.  Unless
you're on some ass-end of the world like Odus, you can probably find
anything to hunt, within your selected level requirements, inside a
10-15 minute hike.  Unless you're 50 or above, of course, but you're
probably permacamped in Velious by then anyway.

It seems to me we allready have a perfectly working port system.  Hire
a druid or a wizard.  Or make friends with one.  It is a social game,
after all.
