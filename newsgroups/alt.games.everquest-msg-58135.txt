Apprentice guide on who appears as a level 20 GM. Volunteer learning to
be a full guide.

Guides are 50 to 54. Levels depend on length of service. All are on /who
as a GM of that level.

Senior guides are 55 to 59. Again, level depends on length of service.

All guides are volunteers.

GMs are level 60- and are paid employees of Verant.

When you have a petition answered, they'll usually tell you their rank.
"Greetings traveller! Guide Frodo here!" etc. They all have green names.
