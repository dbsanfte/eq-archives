Where on earth did you get these points from? Nevermind the fact that
you suggest a druid and monk are no better in groups than necros are
in groups or clerics are as soloists, but the wizard, rogue and monk
scores look even more like someone was playing bingo. Is this based on
some kind of wizard-with-bane/cleric/warrior uber encounter group or
something?
