Had the same problem first time Precia zoned into everfrost.  Most likely,
your Kael files are corrupted.  Do a thorough patch, and it should
re-download Kael if it's bad.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
