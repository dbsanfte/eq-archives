Yep....that's exactly what I do.  I play a level 46 bard and that's
how I normally deal with casters in dungeons when I'm soloing.

The other thing that has worked for me is to include my level 40 mez
song while twisting two of my direct damage DoT's.  I've found that
when I slap a DoT on a mob that is mezzed by me it doesn't immediately
wake the mob up.  If things get too close for comfort I'll mez the
mob, turn off auto-attack, and then heal myself.
