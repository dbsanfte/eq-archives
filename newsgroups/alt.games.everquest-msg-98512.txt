I think we'll end up agreeing to disagree on this issue, so
this is my last hurrah - feel free to post your final words
and we can lay it to rest :)

For some reason I feel tremendously cut off from the action
if I can't see what's going on around me.  It hurts my ability
to control my pet.  I transferred my shaman from Povar to
Lanys (my current server) a while back.  He's pre-35.  I played
him before my mage, and used to love the tactical flexibility.
Recently I tried to play him again - camped some black alloy
and a few other goodies - got a group - and left 2 hours later.
I felt extremely handicapped without being able to get a picture
of the tactical situation.  I also play in 3rd person.  I only
recently found out what a small minority I belong to (according
to a study that was talked about here a while back, 90% of 
players play in 1st person).  I feel an EXTREME need to have
the awareness of what is going on around me, that is not
satisfied with 1st person.  My buddy, with a much better computer
than I have, refuses to come up to the moon, because the framerates
are too choppy - I was going nuts trying to figure out why.  In
the final diagnosis, it seems to be a difference of playing 1st
vs 3rd person.  I go 3rd person, center view on body (which directs
the camera down a bit) then pull back a ways.  As a result of the
slight downward tilt, my lesser machine is drawing far less, and
I have decent framerates.  When I suggested he do the same, he 
said that he was unable to play in 3rd person.  I wonder how he'd
react if he saw that I often switch to a detached camera and
swing around to see what's going on around me?  :-)  Learned that
in my early days with my bard, when a lion add in EC meant 
hightailing to the zone.

The upshot is - *I* play most effectively with a clear picture
of the area around me.  After trying my shaman again, I decided
that I wasn't ever going to try another caster.  If the book
truly goes away, then I'll happily go back to playing my shaman
again.  It's a very subjective thing, obviously I have very
strong feelings about it.
