Spoken like a true non-artist.

Why don't you leave that sort of commentary to someone who actually
understands the situation. Like, for example, the artists.

If one assumes that art benefits society, then it follows that artists
deserve to be compensated for their efforts, both as reward and as
incentive. An artist who must work full time at a conventional job,
after all, hasn't much time to devote to art.

You need to learn the difference between artists and copyright
holders. In the music industry, they very often are *not* the same
thing. 


What did you do today? Did you earn some money at your job? Well, me
and a few hundred other people are each going to take a few cents from
you. It's your money, and we've done nothing to earn it, but hey, if
you can't handle losing a few bucks, you should get the hell out of
the industry.
