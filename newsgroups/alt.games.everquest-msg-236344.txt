I would guess indefinately?


my chanter did a good deal of tanking up to level 35, mostly to work on his
defense while being pl'd. I think the first time he died was on a over pull
of guards in highkeep. orcs never posed the slightest bit of threat.

chanter wasnt really ubered out or anything, just had hp gear.


(Yes, I pl. the fun for me isnt till mid-game(tier's 1 through 3), with my
friends)
