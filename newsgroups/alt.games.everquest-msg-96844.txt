1) no, any spot it seems.

2) yes, in fact possibly slower and certainly more difficult 
and challenging to be in the areas where they could pop.

As you illustrate above, now with a tracker and a puller getting
lizards off the temples in CT singularly is like a walk in the park. 

My druid ran by and saw a crusader on track and got it. The crusader
was in one of the lower spots on the lil pyramids (so not even in what
you'd think would be the main big spot inside) So ANY of the spots on
or around a pyramid can be a spawn spot. Judging by where I saw
another named ANY static spot on the island can spawn ANY of them.
Best bet is the pyramids though.

Its going to take probably less time than it did and far fewer
deaths or running for the zone.

It may be easier to just buy any darkforge you might see
auctioned, which should be popping up a bit more now. Darkforge
is sold very cheap. Crustacean armor is actually much better for sks
or any plate tank, so other things are priced below it. I see people
seeling FULL crustacean suits for 3 k or less, that is a good deal.

If I were you, I'd try to continue doing the quest in feeroot while
sometimes checking your auction zones and using the money from sold FS
(remember, the ogre vendors are INDIFF in the feeroot making selling
FS VERY easy now if you can invis across the naughty bridge and such)
to supplement any darkforge you get with other darkforge or
crustacean.

my troll sk has some darkforge in the bank it no longer even wears.
Crusty was pound for pound better and the skull shaped barbute is
really better for 200 plat or less. I keep the darkforge helm for a
resist kit.. though being only 36 I won't need one for a bit.
