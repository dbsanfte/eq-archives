Oh, quite to the contrary, I use my drogmor almost all the time to
solo my wiz. A soloing wiz will generally never get in melee range of
the mob anyway.

What I do is cast from max distance (root, snare, nuke, root again if
needed, nuke, root again if needed, nuke...). To get around the
mobility problem if you get several resists in a row, I usually have
SOW up, and if the mob get's too close, just click off the drogmor,
get some distance, root the mob and bring your mount back.

The hp regen is nearly worthless to a soloing Wiz, as I don't get hit
(generally) and sit there with 100% HP most of the time. If mobs catch
up with me, and I don't get a port/evac off, I'm dead anyway. I can't
forage, hide or sneak, so no disadvantage there.

Really I think the mounts are the most useful for casters, especially
wizards.
