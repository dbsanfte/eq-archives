"HE" was trying to be courteous is why he moved it.  His message said he
thought it was because of the stackup issue by players.

As for his gripe, I tend to agree -- he got service, just not courteous
service in his mind.

Then again, if a GM has some 20 to 40 petitions stacked up, had 3 or 4 bad
incidents, it can be hard to keep that chipper smile going while dealing
with someone.  They did tell him not to move body again then split to the
next incident.

FYI to origional post person -- bodies are not people and take up no space
like people do so they don't count the same as someone standing there.  That
is why you can run through a dead body but not a person (you bump into the
person).
