Ah, so it's not just me then.
I have a fine connection for about an hour to 90 minutes, then the PL creeps
up to 100% (and a disconnect) over the course of a couple of minutes. Then
followed by the '1001' error for up to half an hour. Happened at least half
a dozen times over the weekend.

I think it's SOE rather than my ISP as my dialup connection is still fine
after I quit EQ - not frozen or laggy (more than usualy) or anything. My ISP
is usually pretty promt at putting up notices about any problems on its own
status page (fixing said problems is a whole 'nother matter, of course =) )

Anyone else having connection problems since the latest round of patches?
