Talent is a synonym for skill.  If you mean that you think that
singing is an innate ability, as opposed to a skill honed by
practice and training, you are mistaken.  Just because there
are people with great aptitude for singing who are self-trained
to the point where they are excellent singers does not make
their ability any less a skill.  I think it's a safe bet that
Sandy Koufax's innate ability to throw a baseball was far
superior to mine, that doesn't make pitching any less a skill.
