Well, the posts are in here, so maybe I misunderstood them.

Exactly. I have no idea why it would affect others.

No idea if it is or not. But there are lots of people looking for
sow and temp in pok.

I realize I'm losing some interaction with other players by soloing.

But I never said I don't talk with other players.

] the fun of that, heck, you seem pretty antisocial, so that might just be 

Nope. I talk, I just don't like to group in an online game. I
interact with other people in and out of the game. But my tech
support job almost forces me to decompress a bit on occasion. I
wasn't joking when I said in another post a number of my coworkers
are functionally illiterate.

] a chore.  But interaction between different character classes and the

I understand grouping and group dynamics. I DMed AD&D for 8 years. I
interact at gaming conventions. I talk to people in day to day life.
I just don't want to do group in this game.

] Its my opinion that this "buff whoring" phenomenum you describe is often

I had never heard of the term until it was posted in this newsgroup.
So its not my description.

] good for an individual, but is in the long run bad for the game itself;

I really don't race through anything. 20 minutes of online time
isn't racing. I'm not including load and log off times... although
sometimes I've spent longer doing that than gaming.

I've seen enough /ooc to know that some folks are getting to 10th
level and up far faster than I have with any of my toons.

One toon I got from start to 6th level in one night in the tutorial,
but there were less than 3 other players there the entire time.
Thats very fast paced for me.
