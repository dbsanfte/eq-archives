Me too, until such point as I want to join someone else or invite someone
else.

Thats when I've found that funny bug I was talking about.  Leave your
invite hanging for a few minutes and you sometimes find you -can't-
refuse it anymore, can't even hit follow and disband, no matter what you
try, you're stuck staring at that follow/decline you never asked for,
until you log out to clear the thing.

Its not every time, but it does happen and it sure is annoying when it
does.  I imagine its little known because not that many people leave
unwanted invites hanging like this, and yet take more politely requested
invites from others later.

Also, eventually the invite itself will time out, what the timer is on
this and what happens when it does is not something I've explored,
nothing much I guess, and if you are intent on soloing then I suppose you
really don't have to do anything after all.
