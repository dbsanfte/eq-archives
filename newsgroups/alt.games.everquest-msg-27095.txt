It's working as intended.  People have been bitching about it for well over
2 years and Verant hasn't made any comments hinting that it's something they
intend to change.

BTW, get used to FFA...no one does much of anything else after level 30.
Typically in pickup groups it's FFA for normal stuff, random for specials
and gems go to the cleric if they're symboling people (otherwise that's
often randomed if it's worth more than a few plat).
