Chuckle... you can always tell druids that spend alot of time soloing
in a group... They have this tendancy to want to snare every mob, as
it comes in... because that's what they do when soloing.
After they get beat on a few times, I usually try to hint that
perhaps they should wait a little while, for the tanks to gain some
agro, before tossing in their high agro snare...
Solo: cast early.
Group: cast later.
Important druid snaring tip_006 =)
