.

There is often unexpected activity in another zone, called RL,
which may preempt someone who intended to stay in Norrath for
hours.  I know that several times in the past three years I've
logged on, looked for, found, and joined a group only to have the
phone ring with something so urgent I have to leave the game.  I
know it sucks, but it shouldn't always be assumed the person
leaving a group is simply inconsiderate.
