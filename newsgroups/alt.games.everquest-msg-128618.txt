<snip-Tactics for soloing in Paludal

Thanks for the tips.  I too am playing a 23 necro in Paludal.  I've been
grouping when I can because the exp is very fast that way, but groups in
Paludal are a crap shoot at best.  It's too bad this zone will soon have the
exact same reputation as LOIO and Highpass/Keep if it doesn't already.

Would you mind giving a little more detail as to the tactics used in Echo?
I would really like to hunt there but I'm a little nervous about it because
I have no idea what to expect.  Where is the best place to camp/pull to?
What do I need to watch out for?  What levels can gain exp there?

Someone I grouped with once bragged about soloing mutants, but when I
checked out that area there were an awful lot of them and very close
together.  It looked a little tough to solo to me.
