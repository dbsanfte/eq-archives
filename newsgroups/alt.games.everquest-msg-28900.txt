and wizzards are the only class in this dilemna when it comes to soloing? Oh
yeah, I forgot about all them soloing clerics, rogues, rangers, enchanters,
magicains, etc - heaven forbid, some of these calsses cant even effectively
solo at all, yet alone "from about 25 until the late 30's".  My thoughts are
that the port / xlocate line of spells where not meant to be money makers,
but tools to enable transport through out Norrath - sorry if you feel
otherwise.

Also about exluding wizzards from groups, please provide info on times you
have seen me exlude one or any time I have been in a group that has. Im
intrigued when this may have happened and I seem to have forgotten all thos
times I /ooc'd "Wizzards suck". Also I have never seen ANYONE say "Wizzards
suck" or anything like that. Oh, or where you just making huge
generalisations?

And FYI, one of my best mates has a level 56 Wizzie and he does VERY well
for himself, perhaps its just you?
