Hopefully not her driving skill.  My grandfather once got furiously mad 
at him, because I *laughed* at him when he complained that a police 
officer pulled him over for going 15 (klicks, this is Canada donchaknow) 
over the speed limit.  Uh, yeah.  Poor, POOR baby.  Amazingly, someone 
wrote a letter to the paper stating the following:

"When we (the neighborhood) complained to the police about people 
speeding through here, we were happy to see them set up speed traps.  
Then *I* got pulled over for speeding.  I am indignant and angry about 
this and plan to complain to everyone I meet about the unfairness of the 
police in making ME follow the law I expect others to follow.  Bla bla 
bla..."

People are STUPID.

Hmm well if he wants defense - I would hope to GOD I'd never be as 
outright stupid as biz's gf was in the *first* place, therefore, said 
conversation would never take place.  Problem solved.

Of course, I remember one guy (thank goodness wasn't dating him) who was 
so anal retentive about his truck that he would *yell* at people for 
*moving wrong* if they rode in the back (here's an idea genius - don't 
let them RIDE in the back, then) - HIM I stayed away from.  Does THAT 
help? *g*
