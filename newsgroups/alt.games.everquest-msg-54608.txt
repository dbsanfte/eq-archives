What religion would that be?

Yes, that's right, you could.

You have lost me at this point. Perhaps you could explain the point you are
trying to make.

I agree that violence begets violence.

Is it the terrorist counter-attack, or the US counter-attack that you
support?

How odd. you are in complete agreement with what Osama bin Laden wants. He
wants the US to leave as well. I wonder why that is not an option for the
US?

That's all the Middle-East has done in recorded

Europeans are the ones that really know how to have a good war, though most
countries have a pretty good idea of how to go about it.

Are you saying the Middle East is worse than any others?

No different from any other country then eh?

(Do you really believe they kill each other for pure fun?)

Isn't what the problem?

The US gave Israel land for a nation?  Are you sure?  Is this like the land
they gave to the Native Americans?

Regardless of who gave Israrel the land, where did they get it from, to give
away?

Or, perhaps they should rethink their foreign policy, and attack the cause
of the problem, and not the symptoms.
