Because I had a problem and they ignored it. I had to email and email
and email. Then I callled, and called and called. I relayed the whole
incident right here in this very newsgroup.

The problem was simple to fix. All my factions had been reset.
They finally did fix it after I had to go through the hoops trying to
even get to talk to my server GM.

A bug caused my problem but the problem was easily fixed.
The bug is excusable, not fixing the problem in a timely fashion
and making it difficult to even 'get to' anyone in charge is not.

The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth. I like EQ, I have been
playing it for a long time. It has its problems but I think Verant has
done a 'decent' job on the game itself. But the CS can really use
some work.

I also just recently had to petition for a corpse that was un-lootable.
I had to wait 6 hours for a response. 6 hours.

Granted bugs happen. If you can't fix them then you should have
some kind of a system in place for when the bug causes grief
to the players.
