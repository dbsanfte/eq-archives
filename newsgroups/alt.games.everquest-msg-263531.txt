Serverside controlled movement. Say hello to Shadowbane and UO, and
the lag phenomenon known as "rubberbanding". Not a good design
decision, generally only necessary when the server must know your
precise position with high degree of accuracy in subsecond intervals
(mmorpgs like EQ update less frequently unless something dangerous is
happening, and have movement controlled clientside so that you are
still able to move cleanly while lagging. The server does have
movement prediction so you have a good idea where everyone else is
between updates, which are about two or three seconds long). As far as
I know there is no good reason for a mmorpg to go that route, and it
has never worked very well.

Still Wish has a bunch of things they're trying, and may be of
interest to other people. They did accept me into their next beta test
but they put it off until next year.
