Well, I've never had two CS people working for me at once, but without
exception every experience I have had has been positive and
professional. And usually reasonably quick (within 30 minutes).

Agree strongly. I spent nine years as a client service rep and manager
for a software company, and the clients who were decent to us got
taken care of immediately. The ones who were jackasses got taken care
of, but only when the decent ones were finished.

Pointless aside:
I once hung up on the primary contact at one of our major customers
(in other words, he was a VIP). He'd been chewing me out and cussing
at me, so "click". I then called my boss and told him "You're probably
going to get a call - I just hung up on so-and-so", and explained why.
Sure enough, so-and-so called and started bitching about me - my boss
explained to so-and-so in no uncertain terms that when he was willing
to be reasonable, our customer support people would be happy to help
him. Until then, please don't call again.
