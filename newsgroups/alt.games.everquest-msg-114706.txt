I have a lvl15 troll shaman.  At one time I was able to use the SLAM
ability.  For quite a while now, I cannot even map it to my combat or
ability keys.  Anyone know what the problem is?  I right-click on an empty
button and SLAM shows up as a option.  But when I click on it, it does not
transfer to the empty key like it's supposed to.  Thanks.
