CHA affects a few things for a few different classes
Any class: if you have the spell divine intervention cast on you higher cha
= great chance of it going off
Charm Classes: higher cha = less chance of charm breaking before max
duration is up.
Lull: higher cha = less chance of resist on lull, pacifcation, harmony type
spells

Basically Cha is for CHArming
lull type spells and divine intervention
