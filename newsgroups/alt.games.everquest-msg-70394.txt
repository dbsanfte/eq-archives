I am not complaining about twinking. I am stating observations about
twinking.

I've seen that defense by people defending their own twinking,
certainly.

To counter your "remembered" but unreferenced statement by Abashi,
here's one that *has* a reference, by one of the original game
designers. Perhaps you've heard of him - Brad McQuaid.

"Twinking: This is a tough one, and in my mind there�s still no �easy�
solution to the twinking problem. One wants a player driven economy
and one wants to encourage replayability� but then one also doesn�t
want to see a bunch of level 5 characters running around in level 60
gear. Some people advocate significant item decay or hard level
limits, but these either don�t address the problem completely, or
introduce other, worse problems. In any case, in 20/20 hindsight I�d
have devoted a lot more time and energy into solving, or at least
addressing, this problem."

Key quotes, so you don't overlook them:

"one also doesn�t want to see a bunch of level 5 characters running
around in level 60 gear."

" I�d have devoted a lot more time and energy into solving, or at
least addressing, this **problem**." [emphasis added]
