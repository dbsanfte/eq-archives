A friend of mine got one..

I guess it depends on the price, but the one's at powerleveling.com  were
ok..

They really just consolidated information you could find on your own. But
they seem to be pretty descriptive and lay out the whole thing for you
easily.

I got 2 good ideas from them, but found out later that a lot of people
seemed to be doing one particular part to make some nice cash.. and I think
VI nerfed the drops you needed.. Although, if they wouldn't have, it may
well have ended up goofing with the 'economical' system in EQ, as you could
have easily made obscene amounts of cash..

So. the one he bought was 'barely' worth $20.00, but I have been playing for
a while. To someone who is new to EQ, they would help considerably more.
