Personally, I would also have liked to see some suggestions for resist
gear for melee classes in this thread, for the day in the remote
future when one of my two girls enters the big leagues. I've twinked
(*ducks*) them both adequately with AC, str and the occasional other
stat, but when I'll have to replace some of their gear with save gear,
I wouldn't know where to start other than with jewelry and the cloak
of ice bear...
