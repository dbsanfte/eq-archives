That is a good observation.  Levels 1-10 are risk free.  Of course,
I wouldn't expect someone that new to the game to be traveling much
anyway.

Admittedly, this is where my theory breaks down.  I can't nail down
when a "newbie" becomes an "oldbie".  You suggest around level 20
which seems pretty reasonable.  And you may be right ... by then the
novelty of traveling may already have worn off.  I almost wish I
had taken notes when I started playing regarding where I went, at
what levels, and why.

In addition, I've seen lots of people that seemed like newbies that
ended up being oldbies in disguise looking for handouts.

I have enough trouble managing ONE character much less TWO at the

Well, you've somewhat convinced me that the problem I see may be
unsolvable in a way that would make the majority of people happy.
Perhaps I'm just over-romanticizing my first few months on EQ when
traveling the world was a grand experience.  I still worry that
true newbies might be missing out on some great experiences because
of the temptation of the books, though.
