There is however some named necro who often loiters at the entrance to the
newbie zone, pacing back and forth between the two guards.  He
aggros on my 59 cleric and even sticks the occaisional spell.  Since I'm
running past him with TBoots or better speed, I just keep going and zone
in to the Hole, he's lost before I'm anywhere near the warrens zone line.

On the other hand I spent some time waiting for a Hole raid the other day
wandering around Warrens and AOE nuking massive quantities of the poor
inhabitants.  I'm no longer KOS so that guy won't annoy me anymore...
on the other hand this was a tedious hour and I doubt anyone who is actually
of a level to hunt warrens for exp is going to pull it off in less than a week.
