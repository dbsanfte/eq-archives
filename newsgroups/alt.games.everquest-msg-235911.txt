On advantageous setup you can run with multiple hard drives is, after the
new drive is set up as main and all data from original drive secured there
( and hopefully back-up on CDs as well ) is to do a fresh install of XP on
the old drive, get drivers and system loaded and buffed, then run your boot
load options and set second drive as boot, install EQ there as well -

Should something happen to first drive and or EQ directory/files thereon,
just boot to second and you will be good to go - this was especially useful
a few times when some of those FRIGGIN 'net hijacker traps stole and took
over and installed hidden crap all over my primary drive
