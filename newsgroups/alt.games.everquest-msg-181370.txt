Hi all,

	What is the chat support service?  I lost my character on a
server outage on Thursday and all support have done so far is tell me
my video driver is wrong(????).  If there is a way to chat to a
support person they may be able to tell me if the character is still
available on the server or not because all of my character spots are
currently blank.

	Thanks for any and all help.

Regards,

Wayne...
