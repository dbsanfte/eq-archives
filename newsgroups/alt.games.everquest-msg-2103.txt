And summon drink at, I believe, 19th.

These are not at all useless. Apparently, after 100 skill in Foraging, you almost
stop getting food and start getting instead the specialty items (surefall sap in
Qeynos Hills, plains pebbles in the Karanas, etc.) Having a reliable source of
food and drink can be important... think of the spells as "never fail/quick reset
food foraging." PLUS if you are soloing on a long camp and start to run short,
having those spells can mean the difference between getting your spawn and getting
food. PLUS when you are in a group, any summon supplies is extremely useful.
