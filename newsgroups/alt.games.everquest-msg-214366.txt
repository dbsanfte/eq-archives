Warriors solo fairly well, as long as they pick their prey carefully; mobs
that they can safely and reliably single pull and kill while losing less than
half their HP.  This last part is critical, because unless you enjoy 15 minute
down times between kills, you want to bind wounds up to 50% HP and then pull
another; its as though for solo purposes your HP total is cut in half.  This,
then, means that HP becomes your critical stat; this is always true for
warriors, but for the solo warrior its literally twice as important.  Dex can
also be a crucial stat, as lacking spells, a warrior can get by on proccing
weapons for snare and slow; these proc more with a very high dex.  In a group,
proccing is also important although there you are looking for hate increasing
procs, still, dex can be very helpful.  This stat matters less than HP though,
early on, because weapons that proc important spells tend to have minimum
levels before they will do so.  A key item is a dagger that procs summon
bandages, if you can afford one, and thats lots cheaper than regen items.

Regen is interesting, but a warrior doesn't get much milage out of small
amounts of it; he isn't spending his time waiting for HP to come back, he's
actively bandaging himself up and then going back in to work.  The regen does
counter incoming damage a bit... but getting real amounts of regen working can
be prohibitively expensive.
