    Then nerf quadding, too, because those quadding wizards out-XP full
groups as well. And don't forget to re-tune the entire pre-60 game, so my
baby necromancer can't out-XP just about anyone or anything you could name
(except perhaps an AoE group - hey, nerf them too). Let's change the entire
game so soloing cannot outpace grouping in any way, shape, or form. And then
will they make changes to player abilities so every character is equally
desireable to groups? What do YOU think the answer is to that?

    The funny part here is this: when that patch comes, your class will also
get a nice, strong dose of "not appropriate". As in, "it is not appropriate
for a damage dealer to deal immense damage and not be responsible for the
aggro generated by that damage". Enjoy being balanced. Perhaps you could get
bound underneath the zone-in to Plane of Justice, so every time you die from
being "balanced" you could look up and see balances.
