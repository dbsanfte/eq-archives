lootwhore, n. - a fucking primadonna level 52 cleric who thinks she 
deserves a Skyshrine Breasplate more than the Level 60 warrior MAIN TANK 
because she "busts her ass for this guild" and then deguilds when her 
husband ranger who was recently awarded a Skysrhine chain tunic is passed 
over for another member on a GOD DAMMED COPY OF EAGLE EYE.

people who put "me" and "my" before "us" and "our" need to go play a 
console game and be alone with their piece of shit paper dolls. >:(
