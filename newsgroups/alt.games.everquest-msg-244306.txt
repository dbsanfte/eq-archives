Not quite entirely true.

Still, true enough. :)

A rogue without poisons is like a hybrid that didn't buy their spells.  
That's overstating it a bit.  But poisons definitely increase the bag of 
tricks you have available.  Especially some of the really advanced ones, 
that allow you to proc a buff on yourself to, eg, decrease the amount of 
aggro you generate, hence allowing a higher DPS without turning the mob 
off the MT...  Even some of the lesser ones will allow you to slow a mob, 
if you're attempting it without a slower, or snare, in absence of another 
snarer.  Poisons are much more of a pain in the butt than buying a spell 
and scribing it, but they can, on occasion, prove very worthwhile.  Sure, 
you can survive without them, but you wanna be the best rogue you can be, 
don't ya?

}OTOH, you can plan your hunting grounds based on where poison
}components drop in order to make progress as you go.

You can get all the way to 250 poisonmaking with purchased ingredients, 
and the cost to do so is not terrribly excessive. Just farm ingredients 
you can't buy, for poisons you might actually want to use.
