I have book of dark bindings, quill, parchments and Concordance of Research.
I didn't buy any other books.

When I tried to use book of dark bindings, it doesn't show any recipe for
scrolls.
All it shows are, practice rune, apprentice rune and training rune.
I typed some letter, word and full name of the spell I wanted but nothing
was shown.
I use oven and loon so I know basic of these containers.
Why it does not show me any recipe? Do I have to buy some books?

I am working on practice research as well. I have never seen Froglock eyes.
Went most places I can go without KOS. I heard I need froglock eyes to make
apprentice rune azla.
Where can I get it???  I am stuck here.
