No, that's not it.  It's because the XP in Paludal is
just incredible.  I could not believe how "juicy" EVERY
kill was for me (dark blue).  I was able to level 2
times a night soloing - and not "marathon nights" but
my usual 4 hour sessions.

Now that I know about PC, I take every new char I make
through there because it's so very worth my time to
travel there (even prior to PoP).
