I hate it when people ask me for buffs [period].

because they always ask me for the set of buffs for the character class that
they think I am.

Now, it was one thing when I was wearing an oracle robe, and actually looked
like an enchanter... (of course I was NEVER /anon then) ... but now that I
don't look like an enchanter.

random guy: "Can I have some Buffs please?"
Me: "No."
randome guy: "Why not? :)"
me: "I can't buff you."
random guy: "I'll wait for you to get mana back."
me: "No, no, I mean I cannot buff you."
random guy: "That's okay, I'll wait until you can."
me: "going to be a long wait."
random guy: "I have time"
Me takes down a frost giant.
random guy follows me through the whole kite, saying things along the lines
of:
"Can I have some buffs now?"
"Or when you get done with this giant?"
random guy: "You had plenty of mana!"
me: "and?"
random guy: "I thought you were out of mana."
me: "I wasn't."
random guy: "So why didn't you buff me???"
me: "Because I cannot buff you."
random guy: "C'mon, please?"
me: "Look, the only spells I can cast on you would turn you into a
smoldering pile of ash.  I don't have any buffs... that's what it means when
I say I cannot buff you.  The words "I cannot buff you" mean there are no
buffs that I can cast on you... you want to wait, maybe in 30 or 40 patches,
VI might decide that wizards should be allowed some spell which is
beneficial to others... in the mean time, I cannot buff you."
random guy: "really?"
me: "If you want me to cast spells on you anyway, you can /duel me, and I'll
give you a free translocate that will leave a smoldering pile of ash with
all your equipment on it here."

Another instance was:
dimwit: "SOW ME!"
me: ...
dimwit: "Hail, <me>"
dimwit: "SOW ME NOW!"
me: "no"
dimwit: "C'MON, DAMNIT, SOW ME!"
me stand, look at him, cast levitate on myself (so he's now looking at my
chest)
me: "go"
me: "away."
I'm thinking he conned me at this point (he was very green to me), because
he backed away, turned and ran.

(is there anything that looks even remotely like an int caster that can cast
SOW?)
