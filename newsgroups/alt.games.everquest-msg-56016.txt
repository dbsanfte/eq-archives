Alas, while this does improve a lot of Neriak factions, it doesn't
improve Indigo brotherhood, which is the one he needs.

Go whack the halfings that infest the forest, and collect the "raider
skullcaps".  When you get a bunch, give them to the guy in the
basement of the Neriak Warrior Guild who's asking for them.  If you're
KOS to him from the beginning, you're out of luck.
