Ahhh, thanks for that. You know, I was so poor (well, I still am) that I
never bothered to buy that level 1 spell but I think I'll go buy it just for
the hell of it now, especially as it has a mana use of 5.

OK, while we're at it, my foraging is at 59 now and I notice that it is
refreshing a lot quicker than it used to but for the longest time there I
wondered if it would ever get better, despite pumping lots of points into
it. Any way to improve that? I roll it continuously with hide, sneak, track
and sense heading while I am medding.

Hmmm, actually that's interesting now I mention it, I have just realised
that I never (I'm pretty sure I don't) see any explicit improvements to hide
and sneak but in the skill list they seem to improve. Is that correct? Don't
they report "You have improved at hide/sneak"?
