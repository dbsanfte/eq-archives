I remember seeing some stuff on Palm.com, but it didn't look very good. Let
me see if I can find it again. Ok here are some links for you.

http://www.palmblvd.com/software/pc/EverQuest-Lower-Torso-Gear-2002-3-28-palm-pc.html

Actually there are close to 20 files on that site that I found. If you do a
general serach on the site for everquest than you will see what I found.
