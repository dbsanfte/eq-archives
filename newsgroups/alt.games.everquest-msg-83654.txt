Believe what u will... it was my first character and yes someone DID give me
most of the set of "dyed red no less" fine plate and I worked my butt off to
get the other pieces made for me. Perhaps you just weren't working hard
enough to build up your armor and maybe you were just such an ass in game no
one was nice to you. BTW you can get the stuff to dye it colors right off
the ground in steamfont so "dyed red no less" is not an issue when you
provide the dye stuffs to someone who makes the pieces for you. The hard
part was killing all those bears cats and wolves to sell their pelts to PC's
for the money for HQ ore and carrying it from Highkeep, you don't always get
xp for killing them... that would be why he is still lvl 13. I worked my
butt off killing time consuming non xp bearing animals so I could sell the
pelts for the plat for the ore for the armor and picked up all the other
ingredients for it and the molds myself too. So if you are in your simple
banded armor with a lousy weapon its 'cause you haven't been playing to make
plat, you've been playing for xp alone.
So sorry you guys in this group are all a bunch of sour faced jealous
nitwits that have nothing better to do than trash someone who was already
disappointed by the loss of months of hard work. You guys are really
miserable assholes and before you get me pissed off over nothing but purile
stupidity I'm going to unsubscribe.
Go ahead. Keep posting your drivel. I won't be back to read it. I've been
reading this group for a week now and haven't seen anything useful yet. All
you do is bitch at and about each other. Games are supposed to be FUN.
Goodbye and Good Riddance,
