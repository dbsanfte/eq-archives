Bard mana is based on Int.  Don't ask, I am not quite sure myself.  When I
answer this question, even though I know the answer to be Int and even
though I have double and triple checked it, I still feel a need to verify it
just once more.

There are a few songs that use mana.  I am pulling these from a list that
isn't planes utd yet, so think of this as a pre-PoP answer :) (I haven't
gotten organized enough yet to make all my notes planes compliant.)

Level 39:  Solon's Bewitching Bravura.  (I use this when soloing or while in
Karnor's to help with mezzing.  Though, I really didn't start to use it
until I was about 44.  Go figure.)

Level 43: Denon's Desparate(sic) Dirge.  It costs 800 mana, pretty much all
you got as a bard in your 40's and even low 50's, is AE, hits a max of 4
targets for 300+ damage and you are usually one of the four hit if you use
it in a dungeon, which is when you would need it the most.  If you have less
then half your health at level 44 or lower, don't use it.  Unless of course
your have 2000+ hit points.

Now, I know of at least one PoP song that usese mana, but I don't think it's
more than 60 or 70.  Not sure what the song is or what it's for.  Like I
said above, I haven't gotten my act together to get moving on adding PoP
stuff to my notes.  What can I say, I just got TSO, it's like a little EQ
for tradeskillers only :)


Hope this helps.
