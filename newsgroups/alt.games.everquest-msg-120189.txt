the problem is is that shes just looking for someone to blame. she should
accept facts.  1) her kid was stupid (not in the iq sense but in common
sense ie commiting suicide is stupid short of a few cases) 2) her kid was
psycho (history of depression and from the sounds of things socially inept)
3) the kid played the game to escape what already appears to be a miserable
life.  now you may say i dont understand.  i disagree i understand much
better then you who feel for the mother for i resemble all three of those
remarks.  should i ever decide to put a bullet in my head, let noone that
knows me blame anything but me i am the master of my own fuckups.  And
should anyone call a lawsuit for me commiting suicide, please let there be
the afterlife i dont currently believe in so that i can haunt the greedy
bastard trying to get rich off of my death.  this mother is only doing a
lawsuit for one of 2 things 1) greed or 2) she cant accept the fact that her
son was an idiot and needs to blame someone else.  the disturbing facts are
that the courts will probably uphold the bitch's lawsuit because the judge
wont have the balls to say "listen maam just because your son was a moron is
no reason to waste our time" and then end the case
