   Well, as I suspected I'm seeing a lot of spells listed that I don't
even recognize.  Yep, I know, I'm the games oldest noob.

   Originally I thought about having gate, but having Feign would take
its place in emergency situations.  If I were going to have a
transportation spell, I would probably take the one gates to PoK, so
that I could drag others along with me if they wanted to go.  But
really, with the PoP books being in several places, I didn't see this as
being all that necessary.  I did think about have a succor spell... but
I dunno, I think I would be using feign more.  And do succor spells work
outside or in the planes?

    I know that I could buy Kei and Ageo from other players, but I
really, really hate hanging out in the PoK calling out for buffs.  I
would much rather just have these too... plus I would be able to give
them to group mates, which would cut out the "I gotta go get KEI"
syndrome that I've heard afflicts others.

   To be honest, I had no idea what would work better...single target
mezz or area effect.  I've only run an enchanter up to about 12 or 14,
and I never really got the groove of it.  I've always been much more
comfortable with wisdom casters, though I did enjoy my necro when I was
running her (to about, what, 26 or so).  Certainly long enough to get
used to Feign!

   As for pet.. well.. Yeah, some sort of mage pet might be better.  But
they get so many... I have no idea what would be the best.  I didn't go
with BL because they have to have another spell gem to buff their pet
up, at least in lower levels.  I just assumed it would be the same at
higher levels.  

   My ideal line up reflects the way I currently play.  A support
character for a massive tank that I almost always duo or 2 box with. 
And I felt these spells would also be useful in larger groups.  I'm
pretty sure that if I were looking at soloing my lineup would be
somewhat different.

   It would also be different if I could choose the stating character
for the line up.  I didn't address this before, because I didn't want to
write a book about the conditions that would apply.  I guess I was just
thinking that the spell line up would come to your main, whatever that
was, and that would be that.  But if I could choose a character, I would
guess that maybe monk would be a good one.. I could get rid of feign and
go with a nuke instead.  Rogue would also be interesting, though I don't
know much about them.... this is the only class I've never played at
all.
