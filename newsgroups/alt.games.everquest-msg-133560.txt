Well, that depends on your level and how good you are at
killing stuff, and the amount of rez you are getting.  A 96%
rez is almost like never having died at all, while a 10% rez
is hard to tell from 'dry looting' your body.

Since rez effects wear off in a couple minutes, you have to think
about how much exp you can make in those couple minutes.

Worse than the rez effects, IMO, is the fact that Rez blows out
all your mana.  Now you have to med back up to full, which
generally takes longer than the rez effects!

My bard didn't care about mana till 39, and hardly cares about
it now, but still didn't take rez unless it meant getting back to his
body quickly, until around 30.  In low 30s he still didn't actively
look for rez, but tended to find the exp returned off the higher
level ones (50% plus) was finally faster exp gain than just going
out and hunting immediately.  If mana was crucial to the exp
gathering operation I'd say several more levels, but by 34 or
so I think a good rez is going to get you more exp back than
you can gain even from a single FM to OOM cycle... thats
the point where you start wanting rez.

Looking actively for rez and trying to never ever dry loot?  Hmm,
somewhere in the high 40s to low 50 depending on class.
