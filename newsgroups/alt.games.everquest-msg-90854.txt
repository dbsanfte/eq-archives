Rangers are, IIRC, on the same damage table as Warriors, so they
really shouldn be putting out about the same amount of damage.  I
guess.

Now, if you were putting together a PERFECT raid, no you probably
wouldn't want more than a couple Warriors, with the rest of your melee
damage being monks and rogues.  Perfect raids are hard to build
though.  All of the hybrids put out very respectable levels of damage,
and can fill in the melee slots just fine.
