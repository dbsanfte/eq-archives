I have gotten it before when logging out, but NEVER ever got it while
playing.. I was lucky we were in an LDoN, and we WON before it happened. but
still I wasn't happy, we were still killin' stuff, and I was the cleric at
the time.. so I was upset to leave my group while needing healing ;(

at least I know now I am not the only one. I was worried it was my computer,
my set up, DX9, or driver issuse that was happening just to me..
