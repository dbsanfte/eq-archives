You don't have /serverfilter on do you?  You only get health updates
every 6 seconds if you have /serverfilter on.  It's basically a small
heal for your pet.  It maybe heals 10% of his HP, I guess it can be
useful if it's a close fight, but pet regen is fast enough after
battle to take care of any lingering damage.
