Not bad AC, Deepwater would give you 21AC but you will need to be a few
levels higher to use the effect.
Helm of Ro is less AC but +8Wis...I would stick with the AC tho.

>       silver amber ring

Eww...at worst a Jagged Band...Look at the Fire Wedding rings, Gold -
Velium.

>       shimmering sapphire ring

See above

>       serpentine bracer
>       serpentine bracer

Where to start...Hero Bracer, Ry`gorr Bracer, Bracer or Ro anything that'll
give you more AC.
That 18 Agility gives you maybe 6AC...

>       lightcrawler vambraces

Not bad for level...Vambraces of Ro will give same AC with +6Wis..Deepwater
Vambs are 21AC and should be <1k

>       dark mail gauntlets

Really could use more AC here. DW will give 16AC but I wouldn't worry too
much about this location just yet, save it for some SCHW later on.

>       adamantite epaulets

Not much on the AC front, nice for some wisdom. There are plenty better AC,
I would go for Crested Spaulders myself, rather have the Stamina than the
Wisdom.

>       netherbian chitin

BP of Ro has more strength but not really worth the money over this, imo. No
immediate suggestions...Treeweave at around 400pp is the next upgrade.

>       cloak of the rygorr oracles

Eww...Spiderfur, Quickly

>       crystalline belt

Eww..again...Smiters girdle, spiderfur belt, Chitinous belt....The spider
fur is going to be there cheapest there by far.

>       small bronze greaves

Anything with more AC, Ry'gorr, Ro (nice stamina on Ro)

>       cotrie general boots

Again, anything with more AC, Ro

Collar?
Again, Spider fur or Ry`gor both should be cheap.

>       Arbitors combine greatsword.

Nothing better for price, ideal Pally weapon.

Do you use 1hder and Shield at all?
Shield I would have to say Sarnak Battle Shield but for the same AC and a
10th of the price look for a Clay Guardian Shield.
1hdr, look for a Mace of the Fallen Crusader...this is a level recommended
weapon for 53rd but I have seen a Magelo prof. of a 43rd Pally and it's
17/25 in his hands...so I recond about 15/25 in yours, not bad for an item
that will get better with level and I bought my Pally one for 50pp...no
joke...they are always sub 200pp on Brisltebane.

Did you say your race? If you did I missed it. With small bronze it must be
Dwarf or Froglok. If dwarf look out for some of the Enchanter Dwarven
armours....See if you can find a smith who makes them and maybe if you offer
provide the materials (normally a lot of boring farming goes into this
stuff) he may do the combines for free, or if not free a hell of a lot less
than buying the item. The same can also be said for Froglok cultural armours
but I imagine Froglok GM smiths are far rarer than Dwarven ones and I have
no idea what their cultural armours are called.
