*rub chin*  I think you are being serious there, so it's with some
amusement that I say that that is pretty close to what they are doing in
EQ2.

Fighter
	Crusader
		Paladin
		SHadowknight
	Brawler
		Monk
		Bruiser
	warrior? (I forget the name here)
		Berzerker
		Guardian

And so on and so forth for Priests, Scouts, and Mages.

There isn't a fighter mage branch, but the Paladin is your basic fighter
priest (although the paladin line of spells is distinct from cleric
spells..ie, they didn't really inherit them, but the class is still true
to the idea of a blending).

From what I understand, every class has primary and secondary abilities.
Primary abilities are not shared to any great extent.  So  no one but a
priest can heal well, no one but a fighter can tank well, no one but a
mage can improve mana regen, and no one but a scout can, err,
well, I'm always confused what they do, but don't take that as an
indication of a weak archetype...I just am not certain which of their many
abilities are primary and which are secondary (they do recon, debuffs,
attack opportunities, movement buffs such as camo and sneak for the entire
group, opportunistic damage, and other...stuff).

But secondary abilities can be shared with other subclasses.  You will
never see another *class* taking a different archetype's abilities, but
subclass, yes.  So you see three non-priest subclases having rez spells.
And you'll see non-mage subclasses having baby root, and probably
non-scout subclasses having movement buffs.  That's what they call the
"flavor" of the subclasses...the mingling of secondary archetype abilities
to the subclasses of other archetypes.
