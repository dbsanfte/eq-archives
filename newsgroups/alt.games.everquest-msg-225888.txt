Anyone who buys or sells an item going for thousands of plat with less 
than 106 charisma is (IMO) completely ignorant or an incredible spendthrift.

Charisma gear is dead cheap.  For 50pp you can get 50 charisma in the 
form of a pair of stiens, and you can get another 50 charisma for a 
similar amount of cash but in a lot more bits and pieces.  You could buy 
that gear and then throw it away immediately after buying a horse and 
Still be a thousand pp ahead of the game.

But long before you get enough cash to consider buying a horse you 
should already own enough gear to do this with, because every merchant 
transaction you make, be it selling off junk loot, buying peridot for 
your buffs, or shopping for bargains, will cost you less or pay you 
more.  It took my 44 cleric ONE stack of peridot to make back the cost 
of an Opal Encrusted Stein.

One horse?  I could outfit an entire guild with opal steins for what 
you'd save going from 56 cha to 106 on the cheapest pony.

Splendid
