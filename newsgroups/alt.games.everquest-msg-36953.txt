How new is your server? That might have something to do with it. Mine has been
up since phase 4, which is why I figure the newbie population is slowly
decreasing to almost nothing.

Of course if you're on a maxed population server (Mine isn't) that could be the
reason, too. You said they always have someone farming, any idea the level range
of the farmers?

40 people in FM seems a bit much even for a high population server considering
their are easier zones with better exp and items available.

Eventually though I think quality of loot is what will make or break a zone. I
don't think there is anything in Najena  as an example that a level 60 can't get
better and just as easy elsewhere.
