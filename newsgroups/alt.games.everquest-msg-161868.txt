For the House of Representatives, Australia has a
'preferential' system of voting. To win, a
candidate has to get over 50% of the vote. If
there are only two candidates, then the vote is
simple. When there are more than two candidates,
as there usually is, then the lowest scoring
candidate from the primary vote, is eliminated,
and the preferences, as written on the ballot
paper are distributed. This process continues
until a candidate has over 50% of the vote.

The Senate uses a system of proportional
representation.

The thing I like most, that is different from the
UK, about the Australian system, is that it is
compulsory.

Whats the Billy Connolly quote "...the desire to
be a politician, should be a disqualification from
ever becoming one"
