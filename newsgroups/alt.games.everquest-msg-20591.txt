The brown chitin protector did not get it's stats upgraded.  It was
ALWAYS AC12 and 9 to damn near useless stats.

It's the *crystal* chitin brestplate that was upgraded recently.  I
know the AC went from AC15 to AC25 making it almost as good as the
Trak BP (Trak BP has lower AC but right click Choloroplast makes up
for the differnece).
