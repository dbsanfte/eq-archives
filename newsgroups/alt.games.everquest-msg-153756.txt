    I doubt it's being used to sell more copies of the expansion. It's being
used, rather, to extend the shelf life of that expansion. Luclin being
"solved" as early as it was left player plenty of idle time to bitch, moan,
and complain about all the problems in the game. Verant doesn't want players
to have that sort of idle time, because it makes more work for them and
reduces player confidence in EQ.

    Um, no. My guild has tanks over 7500 HPs buffed. If that tank has
Balance on them (a curse, procced by various Ssra mobs, that halves or
quarters (forget which) the amount a heal on the cursed person lands for)
then 7500 HPs is a joke.

    Already untrue. And take your "for all but the most uber" qualifier and
stick it where the sun don't shine, too, because last time I checked I paid
as much as you do to play EQ.

    Nope, there's no challenges left in game to occupy us. We beat them
already because they were so poorly designed. ;-)
