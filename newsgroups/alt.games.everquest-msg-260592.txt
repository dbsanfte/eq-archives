According to new upcoming events in EQ:

You can now only group with people of same level, race and hair color. We
also have been debating whether or not to implement restrictions on IP
addresses so you can only group with people from the same IP address. We
feel that grouping should be fun and enjoyable, so we want to make grouping
a MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS for all of you.
We will be also restricting raids further to only allow 5 people now, and
these characters *must* have the same hair color! This is of extreme
importance for the balance of the game.

Have a nice evening ;)
