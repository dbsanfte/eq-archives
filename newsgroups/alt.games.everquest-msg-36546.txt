Now THAT was a great fucking game. It easily had me more addicted than EQ, it
was huge! and i remember using squared paper to make the maps, little keys that
you had to find by squinting at the screen while whacking up the contrast
because the things were exactly the same shade as the floor they lay on.
Buttons the size of a crumb on walls, you had to find in about 5000 square feet
of dungeon. Those little screamer tree things and that room on level 4 where
they re spawned 'the supermarket'. That game had levels aswell but your
character could progress in all of them, took alot longer to gain a level than
in EQ, i remember throwing a two frame animation ninja star at a portcullis for
at least 12 hours to raise my ninja level. Dungeon master 2 sucked though.
<--goes off to dig out atari st and re-live the days when games were good :P
Btw Windows owes more than a nod in GEM's direction imho.
