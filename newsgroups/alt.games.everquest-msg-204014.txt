Need to know what gear you have now.

However, make sure you have focus items.

Affliction haste, extended and efficiency.
These will help in the long run.

Also getting an Extended Enhancement item Like
Rokyl's channeling crystal is nice for personal and pet buffs.

I don't care if the focus items have shitty stats or not the focus
effect is worth it.
