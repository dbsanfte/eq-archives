Which certainly covered at least their development costs.  I'm
assuming they sold 100,000+ units of each... any game that does that
well is a success.  Particularly since I'm sure that it doesn't cost
nearly as much to produce an addon as the original game.

I don't know anything about their architecture, but do they really run
each zone on separate hardware?  If that's true, in some ways the math
is too straightforward; they've added so many zone since the original
EQ I would have thought they would have had to up prices before now if
each zone required new hardware.

Of course.  However, it still isn't as simple as "we have twice as
many zones, therefore our hardware requirements have doubled".

Good point.

Ah, so YOU run the business?  Can I send bugs to you?  :)
