SOE doesn't care at all about what a guild says it will do.

They do care, a little, about what it does; if they consistently and 
agregiously violate the EULA they may be warned and eventually 
disbanded, AFAIK this has only happened a few times.

Also, they care about the body count, a little; to form a guild you need 
to have 10 members (that is, 10 different accounts in the guild) and if 
your membership falls below that they might disband the guild... 
although I think this has actually happened fewer times than the EULA thing.

To form a guild... well I don't know, these days.  Used to be you needed 
to go in to the chat server with 10 accounts and all request a guild, 
then all show up in game in one spot so a GM could do a head count.

Something that is of interest is that the original guild leader has 
absolute control over the guild; he designates officers and so on of 
course, but what I mean is that at any time, even years after leaving 
the guild, he can contact SOE and get leadership restored, at which 
point he can run around kicking people out, demoting people, inviting 
new ones, officering whoever he likes, even disband the guild.

So if you ever "inherit" a guild, thats always in the background; unless 
you really trust the leader, doing mass guildremove and forming a new 
guild is a safer choice.

At any rate, to report a guild, just do a report as usual, which will 
send ten lines of text from your chat window, then petition with the 
name of your report and explain your problem.  To be honest, GM service 
being what it is these days, don't expect a response.
