AND 2 glass shards.
You can get the silks killing Crystal Spiders in the Thurgadin Mines as well
as Crystal caverns etc.
The Glass Shards can be purchased from the vendor in the bank.
You can often buy the Small Block off various vendors in Thurgadin as
players sell to them ...

> Say to that person "What velium vapors?".
