Speaking as a Monk, most Monks are the designated puller we have to get
rather close to the mobs to do this my best range weapon has a range of 75.
I prefer master looting just to get a share I do ask for autosplit to be off
just to help speed up pulls. with autosplit off I will take off looking for
the next pull just prior to the mob is dieing providing I was not warned off
due to low mana. If autosplit is on I will wait till all the mobs have been
looted then drop excess coins then go pull. I do believe the group rules and
it is their choice contentious pulls or a 30-60 second delay between pulls.
I am fortunate to have a 2 stone weight cushion but I will still dump all Gp
Sp and Cp received off each pull if you don't you are over before you know
it.
