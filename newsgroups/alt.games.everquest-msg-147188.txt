Many of my characters have Hand to Hand Skill.  I never quite understood the
usefulness of this skill unless one is a monk so I never developed it.  But
with my new rouge I am trying to experiment with it to develop it.  At level
14 I started to train the skill and got it up to 10.  But it was very time
consuming.  It can take 5 minutes or longer to slug it out with Young Kodiak
although he is dark blue to me.  Rouge can hit at meager 3 or 4 damages a
punch.  I needed to kill him many times so that he remained at level 14
while he gained his skill points.  Got tired and moved on.  At level 16,
Orcs at Orc highway can slug you at 30 damages a punch!  My rogue is still
punching at 5 at most.  Am I too late to get that skill up?

Emilio.
