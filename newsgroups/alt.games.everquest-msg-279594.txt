I created a bank of hotkeys for dealing with the Magus.  Each key
looks something like:

/attack off
/pause 2,/target Magus
/say North Ro

That way I don't have to turn to face the Magus.  (And I can use the
keys while running past the Magus if I need to escape a train, etc.)

But I agree that saving facing on bind/port is both welcome and minor.
E.g., it means my bazaar mule is now facing the right way when she gates
back to her stall. :-)
