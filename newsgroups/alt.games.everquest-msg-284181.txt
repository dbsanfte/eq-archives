Ok, so in a situation where the bard is not melee'ing at all but
rather just twisting his badass tunes, is it feasible to keep swapping
instruments based on the song?

I'm aware of /melody and have used it, nice add to the game imo.  I'm
also aware of bandolier and have used it.  However, I've not used
bandolier to time it with the songs in /melody.  Is that the new
format these days?

Thanks.
