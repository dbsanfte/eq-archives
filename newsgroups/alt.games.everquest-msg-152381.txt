Trouble is, the whole chat room/social thing is the rage right now,
and publishers are not going to ignore that on the basis of game
integrity. I long for a good immersive MMORPG that can incorporate a
functional growth process (getting better at everything you do and
having newer opportunities and better abilities to face them open up
to you as you go) and the feeling of D&D RP all at the same time in a
graphically-robust manner. For me that rules out anything using a
third person perspective (UO for example - just don't like the look).
I think EQ comes closer to this than any other game out there.

I think that in these games, immersion and adventure should be king.
As soon as they make it a levelling grind, it gets a bit tired. By the
same token, what fun would the game be if it were quick and easy to
get to level 60 (65)?

Rumble <--- thinks maybe Ramble would fit better sometimes...
