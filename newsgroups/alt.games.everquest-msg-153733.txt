This is precisely what we were complaining about.

Monks do more damage than rogues, avoid damage
better than anyone, and have AC totals right in line with
plate classes.

Barring Defensive, monks take less damage from being
sponge than anyone else.  Sure, they have fewer HP
than other tanks unless very well equipped... but
other than CHeal, having a smaller HP max doesn't
matter much, efficiency comes from taking less
damage so you don't need so much healing to keep
you alive.

The classic monk/shaman duo relied on slow
on the target combined with monk very high mitigation
to make shaman heals (pre incomplete) a viable
way to keep the monk alive, better than any other
tank class for a shaman.  Not just at high end, but at
every level, a shaman or druid (and pre-50 or so, a cleric)
was better off with a decently equipped monk as MA.
