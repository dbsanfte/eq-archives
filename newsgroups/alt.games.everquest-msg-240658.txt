Little confused here...

Bringing an alt caster up... and am now doing LDoN runs with him...
now at 50+ getting the points for the greater LDoN de-trap spells is a
breeze, a few hours work...

At 20th level... well... it doesn't even make sense...

The lessor spells ar 14th level, but cost 25 adv points... and I'm
getting 1-2 pt per adventure, and I'm picking up better than half a
level per adventure...by the time I can afford even one of these I
will easily be 30+ (esp. because i do more than just ldon)  and would
be eyeing the next tier of these spells.

Am I missing something or is there no reasonable way to get the low
level trap spells before you've outleveleled them... 

So than i thought, maybe they were really in the game so hi-levs could
start working traps before they could afford the greater spells... but
that's nonsense the greater spells are cheap relative to the
adv-p/mission earned.

or am I just missing something else...

It seems silly for dungeons to be delivered with traps *nobody* who
can get near them will be able to open.

thoughts?

And to vent on another irritating note... I was on a 3 person ldon
with a cleric (me), sk, and monk... and failed by timeout as we led
the rescuee into the room with the entrance... That burned.... we were
pretty pleased, found the guy without maps and without track... and
then failed after there was no one left in our way to kill. :(

We also had a *bad* encounter with an enchanter midway through that
ate 15 minutes, with charm & mez... and finally death. I'm not sure
what what strategies to employ against a chanter at this low a
level... the hi-level standby...huge Magic Resist is simply not
availab;e... and we were mezzed and charmed over and over and over :(

After the wipe we just snuck by with soothe.

I think we'd agreed to try fear kiting if we'd had to kill him... but
that's a tactic you usually need to prep in advance... clear mobs
around him... etc ... not something you can do when you 'discover' a
mob is an enchanter when first mez lands.
