I don't doubt it.  What I posted was not meant to be a slam on people
from India.  In fact, I have worked with many from India on their work
visa's.  I find their culture facinating and I really enjoy their
food.  The Indians I have worked with have always been curteous and
intelligent.

As I said before, my complaint is outsourcing over hiring qualified
Americans.
