Thanks for confirming that.  Not sure why or where I remembered seeing a
specification that it needs to be made to be backward compatible.  It always
has been in the past.  Though I'd not trust it completely with PC133 and
PC66 in the same system.  Not sure how well the PC133 would handle at half
its speed it was built for.
