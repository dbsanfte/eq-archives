get to the moon and get a bind

Paludal is great and Netherbian is the next step up

the Brigantine Bronze drops like mad at the Recondite camp near Shadowhaven

as for the weapon, you might want to look into getting a 1HS and 1HB,
preferrably the 1HB if you ever intend on getting a MoSS.... try to keep
those skills on an even pace

dont worry too much about the quests, we got screwed in that department.....
but get to Cazic Thule in late 20's for that darkforge!
