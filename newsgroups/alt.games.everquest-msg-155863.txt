Sounds like you are just hitting a wall where you cant solo any more.  It happens.

You need to search out people like you and try to join a smaller guild just for xp
groups.  Most high end guild wont take anyone till they hit 60 and some want you
to have an AA title too.  Just look for people in your level range, ask them about
their guilds and see if they interest you.

I currently have a 55 Bard and am in a small guild.  But in that guild there are a few
players that get invited to big raids on other guilds.  Sometimes I get to tag along.
Nothing Uber yet, been to a few older planes, done the old world dragons, been to
the bottom of the hole, kedge things like that.  We can easily put together 2 or 3
groups in the low to mid 50's to do some decent raids but right now the guild is mostly
about forming friendships, helping the lower people level and getting good xp groups
together.  The uber stuff will come, it just takes time.  You cant go up to people demanding
to join their guild and demanding to go on raids.  You have to put time into getting to
know people and getting invited along first.
