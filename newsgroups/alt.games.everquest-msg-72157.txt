Oh that sucks.

I like the way we handle it. The raid leader has a "loot distribution
list" broken down by classes. Assuming you raid with any frequency,
you're on the list. When something drops, the raid leader announces
who gets it. If the recipient doesn't want it they can pass (and we're
expected to know whether we accept or pass without asking stats). When
you get something you drop to the bottom of the list. The list is
updated immediately after every raid and posted to the website.
Naturally, if you're not on the raid, you don't get offered anything.

The only time we roll on anything is for the benevolence quest, since
everyone wants it.
