    As near as can be told, every tick the mob makes a resist check. If they
make it, charm breaks. If not, they stay charmed. This seems to be verified
by the longer average charm times for mobs that are resist debuffed. If CHA
reduces chance of resist, it will lengthen the average charm duration.
