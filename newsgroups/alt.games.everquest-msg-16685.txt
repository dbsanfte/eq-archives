The leaves spawn at random places, which means they can spawn in tress,
under rocks, etc...  And they never despawn, so if there are only 10 in the
zone at one time, and 5 are unreachable, then you'll never get more then 5
available until next patch.

And unless you use ShowEQ you can pretty much give up looking for them.
Those that use ShowEQ can just run around and grab every leaf.  Then do it
again when they respawn until all of them are unreachable.

But Verant has said they are adding them to the forage lists.  Aot of good
that does for us non-foragers, but at least they'll be a little more
available.
