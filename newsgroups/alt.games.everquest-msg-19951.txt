  I'm Paladin level 6... 3 questions:

What can I do to heal myself. Exactly how do I go about it...I have NO
clue ?

How can I find out what equipment I'm allowed to use...I sometimes will
buy a weapon or piece of clothing, and then try to put in on and find
out it's not permitted for my class/race/diety...and lose money selling
it back. Can I find out before I buy it ?

What adds experience to get to next level...specifically, does slaying
new beasts add experience faster than just many fire beetles ?

Any help appreciated !
