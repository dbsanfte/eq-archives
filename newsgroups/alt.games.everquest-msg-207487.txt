After most patches, someone says that jboots have been nerfed, and it's
always false.

Well, I noticed something interesting today.  I logged in, aggroed the same
set of mobs I've been kiting for almost all of level 56 and the 86% of level
57 that I'm done with...ran them twice around the same circle I always run
them around to gather them together, turned to snare them...and they were
way closer than they should have been.

After I killed them, I started running, clicked off my jboots, and I did
slow down some, so the jboots were speading me up.  I then clicked them back
on...and it sure seemed to me that I sped up to faster than I had been
before I clicked them off.

I wonder if there is sometimes a glitch in run buffs like jboots that are in
effect during a patch?  That could explain why some people think they've
been nerfed after every patch.

This would be consistent with something I saw once before.  I read the
claims of nerf, logged in and measured with a stopwatch, and found my jboots
were only giving 20%, instead of 35%.  I then tried another zone and got the
same thing.  I went back to the first zone to verify, and they were back to
35%.  It's quite possible that I reclicked the jboots sometime in there.
