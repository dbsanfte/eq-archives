Well, you'll notice in debates where there's two opposed sides, generally 
speaking, camp A thinks camp B is full of whiners, and vice versa. :)  
Also note, I'm trying to stick with Merriam-webster, here, it's not really 
my definition. :)

}Still, I accept that I have been most adamant on the issue, even though I
}have conceded  points and discussed it reasonably for the most part.

I think te part of your support of the issue that looks -whiniest- is that 
you repeat yourself.  If twelve people criticize your idea in 
substantially the same way, it is generally sufficient to respond to any 
random one of them with any new insight you can provide on the issue.  
I've noticed 3 or 4 of your posts that say, basically, "see my other 
posts!"  That's usually a cear sign that the current post was a waste of 
your time.  Of course, I'm guilty of this 'crime' myslf, often as not, 
when I feel deeply invested in the issue, but I don't think it makes my 
case any stronger when I do, and usually detracts from it.

}I dont' know if my viewpoint is right or wrong, I just know I believe it
}right, and while I've found the debate educational, I haven't been convinced
}otherwise yet.

Well, you're wrong.  So ner. :)  I don't think we'll know the first week 
of the new expansion.  Probably not for the first month.

One thing you keep saying is 'druids need a class-defining ability!'  I'm 
really not sure that's true.  I certainly didn't think ports were it, if 
you ever had one, since are almost as good if not better for it.  Ability 
to PL, well, maybe.  But druids are the jack of all trades.  That really 
might be a class defining ability in itself.  Oh wait, enchanters are kind 
of jack of all trades too... hm. :)

As for not having anything that you do better than anyone else can do, 
there's those raid-quality resist buffs... :) And you do share with 
rangers the ultimate in snare capability, and get it sooner.

I think if you have any legitimate gripe, it's the harmony thing, not 
ports.  I hope they fix that soon and well.

}I also know that anyone that doesn't follow a majority opinion would always
}be a Whiner by your definition, and in that case I don't MIND being called a
}Whiner.

Well, that was sort of my point.  There have been about 4-5 posts where 
you said 'oh, here we go with the insults!' and I had to scroll back and 
think really hard to figure out how you got offended.

(Psst... 'Majority' is irrelevant.  Both sides are just a pack of whiners.  
Welcome to USENET, good to have you back. :) )

Oh.  Time for my whine.  

I want a pointy hat!
