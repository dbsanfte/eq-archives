The usuall usage of the appellation 'Usenet' should be capitalised, and
usage of 'the' is generally considered a redundancy.

I think you misunderstand the delineation between 'noob' and 'newbie'...

A 'newbie' is someone who gives the impression of enthusiastic but misguided
attempts to 'fit in'... this phase, and it IS just a phase, of a persons
'career' in certain aspects of online communication is usually fairly brief
as they become used to the conventions and customs already established by
those around them...

'Noob' on the other hand, is generally a lable reserved for those people
that haven't yet reached a stage of maturity where they can accept
criticism. It's usage is not confined to those whose 'online lifetime' is
still in it's early stages... and in fact is more usually applied to those
people who seem bent on entering some kind of 'dick waving contest' about
their own particular experiences, before they've had a chance to find out if
they're even in the right 'size category' :o)

On the contrary... I found Ben's initial summation to be quite insightful
and well reasoned... and I have yet to find any evidence to alter my own
observations, which have lead me to a similar conclusion as Ben.
