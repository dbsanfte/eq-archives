Not only does gear work for bards, it works extraordinarily well.

With their med skill capped at 1, bards regen about 1 mana per tic 
standing and 2 mana per tic sitting.  FT 1, then, doubles their standing 
mana regen and increases sitting regen by half... but bards very rarely 
sit down, so in essence it will double their mana regen.

FT 15 will give them 16 times their base mana regen.  (or around 8 times 
their mana regen sitting) Imagine if you could find items that would 
raise your characters' mana regen by that kind of multiple.

I didn't get to Fade levels, but charm burns mana, and getting a FT 1 
earring made the differnce between "charm for an hour, then find 
something else to do cause you're OOM for the next hour" and charming 
all night long with only a rare pause to sit for a couple minutes.
