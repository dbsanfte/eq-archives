    My last PvP experience was on Test. I was a level 9 skeleton, and I had
a level 2 necro and a level 1 cleric pinned to the guards at the entrance to
Neriak. If they moved ten feet from those guards, they died. So there was
nothing they could do except beg in /ooc to be allowed to play the game.
What, exactly, should they have done? At their level they die if they try
and train guards on me, not me. They can send tells out to higher levels for
help, but they'd have to find someone who cared. Or, they can do what they
ended up doing - camping to play somewhere fun.

    There are some parallels. In this case, you have to find a GM who cares.

    I think this is the root of the entire thread. Dennis says, "PvP is bad,
mmmkay?" Silverlock says, "Is not!" Silverlock even provided an example
where he was gacked without hope twice, and likely lost a fair chunk of time
getting back where he was because of it, but still enjoyed himself because
he felt he helped defend the realm. I think if Dennis said, "PvP is bad FOR
ME, mmmkay?" this thread wouldn't have happened.
