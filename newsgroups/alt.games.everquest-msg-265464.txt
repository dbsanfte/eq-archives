Well, They *will* waste their time making another law that won't be upheld, 
simply to appear to be Doing Something. That, however, is just politicians 
trying to keep their jobs. 

The real solutions are going to be technology oriented. Personally, I 
prefer the more draconian solutions, but they need the cooperation of the 
main trunk providers; Any given domain that is sending X amount of spam 
traffic over Y amount of time gets cut off the 'net, period. 

This would cause an awful lot of upset initially and yes, a lot of 
innocents would be affected, but it would have the effect of the ISPs 
themselves being more proactive in their spam control. Much better for the 
ISPs to be monitoring outbound traffic from their users for flood spam than 
to have their upstream provider, or their upstream provider's upstream 
provider cut them off of the 'net entirely. 

Spam costs big time - not only on our (the end-user) end, but in the middle 
(The ISPs - bandwidth, storage, staff time, etc), and the top end (backbone 
providers). You mention you get 100-150 a day - I get two to three 
*thousand* spams a day (granted, my line of business puts my email address 
all over the place), but thankfully I've been using Vanquish for spam 
control (Challenge/Response type of thing) - Still, spam's gotta be nailed 
at the source (ISP/Client), laws will do nothing but make a few lawyers 
some extra cash.
