My first attempt was ruined by someone else, my second was ruined
because we first had to fight Fergul, Gralk, Fergul mk II and "My
master is Fergul mk II" broodmother. I died in an attempt to keep
Fergul mk II from depoping before extra reinforcements got there
despite having low health and lower mana. His pet killed me and they
both went bye bye. 
Me and the epic wielding shaman who insisted we could do it by
ourselves would EASILY have done it alone, if only Fergul had repopped
correctly.
