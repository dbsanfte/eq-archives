You've really been around since beta 3?  If so, you'd know that there
is an absolute *ton* of content aimed at low-mid levels, many many
dungeons aimed at under 30's.  How many of them have you actually
done?

You obviously didn't even bother to read what Jeremiah said.  It was
tried in the Warrens and in Stonebrunt, it was called Trivial Loot
Code, and most people hated it.  So they removed it.

Those low-mid levels have plenty dungeons available to them, but they
still sit in EC, SK, Oasis, LoIO like the sheep that most of them are.

Like it or not, most players have high level characters, and that's
where most (not all) of the new content should be aimed.  Simple as
that.
