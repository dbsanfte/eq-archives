Usually it's not sent through the ISP's servers. It's sent through open 
or hijacked relays, many of which are in other countries. Of course the 
easy solution is just to generally block the outbound SMTP port from 
leaving your network from customer connections, unless they provide a 
reason for needing it. Which is what we do.

Also, you should also block outbound packets  that do not address as 
being from your ip range, example blocking pings that say they are from 
205.188.157.232 when you are comcast.net (205.188.157.232 is a DNS 
server for AOL) That prevents RDDoS attacks... send pings from all over 
to big high bandwidth machines, like internet core routers, with spoofed 
return ip addresses to cause the reflected responses to flood someone else.

There's a list of about 10 things every ISP should do on one of the 
security sites; they are very simple to put in. Those 10 things would 
prevent 99% of the untraceable attacks, DoS's, viruses, and spam. It 
wouldn't block the attacks mind you, just make it relatively easy to 
track the attack back to it's sources. Amazingly I read somewhere that 
of the top 50 national ISP's in the US, AOL is the only one that has 
implemented more than half of those suggestions.
