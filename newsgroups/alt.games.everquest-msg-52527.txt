Flash of Light is a very low level cleric spell (also paladins and shaman)

For extremely little mana, it blinds the target for up to 18 seconds (usually

lasts the full duration)

Hunting NPC's, they will only be able to concentrate on you if you are
in melee range, blind.  If their target isn't in range, they wander around
somewhat aimlessly till the spell wears off or they stumble across
something they can hit.  They don't run off with purpose, like they
do if feared, and the spell wears off quickly, so they come right back
if they do go out of range.

You can use it to control aggro, blind a mob in a melee and it won't
leave the fight to come get you when you heal.   Blind a mob before
breaking Mez and it won't be able to go grab the chanter.

I literally use it as a kiting tool; blind, nuke, wait for mob to return,
repeat.  Never get hit, never need snare, hardly ever face an add
if you do it in a wide open area like Great Divide.  Cost of blind
is so low that its hardly noticable, so the question is can you nuke
the mob to death or not?

In combat versus PCs, things are a little different.  If you've ever
been blinded (say by good old Runnygup in the Tox) you'll
recognize the effect.  Your screen goes completely black except
for the green connection bar.  You get sounds but no text
or picture, not even your controls.

This is astonishingly effective in shutting down most people;
unless they are good at all hotkey operation they are crippled,
even if they are they can't tell where you are, whether you
are in range, what's happened when they attempt various
actions.

Spell casters who aren't crippled can still slam you around
pretty well; most spells don't require that you face your
target and have a pretty good range.  They can just keep
dropping the bomb on you like nothing happened.

Melee characters, though, have it harder.  To hit you
with their weapons or bash/slam you, they need to get
toe to toe and face you.  This is very hard to do with
no visuals, particularly since the blinding caster isn't
acting idiotic like blinding casting mobs, which either
stand still or run up to melee you.  Run a short distance to
one side or the other and nothing but sheer luck is going
to put that tank in striking position.

One thing a melee can do, though, is use a ranged
weapon.  If they are facing in the right general
direction, shooting will actually line them up with
you.  Further, getting hit by arrows can interrupt
spell casting.  To shoot, you don't need to stop,
like you do with spell casting, the system will
stop you if your weapon has cycled, and it
won't stop you long.

What this allows, then, is for you to slam a fair number
of arrows in your target while moving directly towards
him, correcting your path if he moves, hopefully
stopping him from reapplying blind till you reach
him.

Even if you get rooted, you'll still be able to do
appreciable damage from a distance, which is exactly
what the cleric is trying to prevent.
