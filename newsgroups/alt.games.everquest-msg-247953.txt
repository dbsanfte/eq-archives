}Do you actually need to turn on the new models to use a horse?

Yes.  If I don't have the new model for whatever race I'm currently 
illusioned as turned on, I can't summon my mount.  Similarly, changing to 
such a form while mounted sometimes gets a 'spell does not take hold' 
error, and sometimes dispells my mount.  I haven't figured out if this 
depends on which illusion I'm using or which patch I try it after, though. 

I generally just click the mount or illusion, as appropriate, and try 
again.
