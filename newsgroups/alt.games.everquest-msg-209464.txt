As a shaman, if I have LFG on, regardles of what zone I am in, I will get 
tells asking if I want to group somewhere.  Heck, even if I don't have 
LFG on, if I'm in a zone like PoK or PoT, I'll get tells.  So, I go find 
myself a nice solo spot, put up LFG, and get xp while I wait for a group.  
Of course, being a shaman has a lot to do with that.  People probably 
don't usually go out of their way to find a necro or wizard or druid for 
a group, whereas they do for a shaman or cleric or enchanter, and often 
for a tank.
