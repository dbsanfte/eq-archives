Actually, if you got the message that it could not get better, then you 
had maxxed it on the 8 woe/envy turn ins, and just found out about it on 
the gem turn in.

As for the turn in shaman, he almost certainly has faction work to do, 
you take a faction hit (fairly big on I think) upon completion of the 
epic.  I have not checked my faction, so I don't know what it is since 
completing mine.
