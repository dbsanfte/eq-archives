My level 39 ranger was in Burning Woods at the advice of a more experienced
player. I poked around a bit but never ventured very far into the zone.
Reason was I was scared. I knew nothing of the area and the few mobs I saw
conned red. I heard the best place to group in Burning Woods is in the
center of the zone, but I am too chicken to venture that far.

Anybody else get strong enough feelings from EQ to make you do illogical
things in the game?
