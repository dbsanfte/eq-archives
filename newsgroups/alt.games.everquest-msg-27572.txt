buggy how? any ideas. buggy or no its worth a shot even if its only a 2 day
war. its not like we are doing it with a guild we hate,  Basically me and my
g/f are in different guilds on TP and she suggested in to her leader and I
to mine.  im thinking the rules are level 8 level limit. no exp loss no loot
or coin loss. Like Dueling with an 8 level limit and the option to gang up
on a person not just 1 on 1
