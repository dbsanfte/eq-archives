Well, Duh. I never said legality has anything to do with it... In my view 
(and note that I don't smoke it, myself) smoking pot at home is right 
--whether it's legal or illegal-- but smoking pot when you are overseeing 
a nuclear reactor and need to stay sharp is wrong, so again, it's 
circumstantial. 

Of course, before you start pulling out straw men, I cannot conceive of
any circumstances under which something like rape is right, but that can
be expressed as "the set of circumstances under which rape is right
contains zero elements"; that doesn't invalidate the fact that the
morality of acts is determined by the circumstances under which they are
carried out.

Well, if your definition of "religious" is wide enough to include atheists, 
I suppose it cannot be argued with.
