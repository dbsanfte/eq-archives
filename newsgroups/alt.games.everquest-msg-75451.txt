What you are seeing is someone typing in the long auction eg "/auc WTS Blah
blah XXdel XXdam Procs Pitiful Buff (Human Beastlords with dodgy facial hair
only) 75K OBO" and then pressing shift+UpArrow to repeat the message. What
you want to do is create a hotkey with more than one line of "spoken"
text...afraid it can't be done.
