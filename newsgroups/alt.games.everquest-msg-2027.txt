Right after reading this I logged onto Tarew Marr and this exact thing was
happening in E Commons.  apperently a group was camping orc 1 and was getting
pissed because other people were going there.  So they shouted (not ooc but
shouted) that they were camping orc 1 and for everyone else to "buzz off".  I
sooo wanted to go there and attack things that they weren't touching just to
piss their rude butts off.  I feel that if you show up after me and you are not
trying to kill the exact creature that I camped first or if you are not killing
something I am attacking at that time there should not be a problem.
