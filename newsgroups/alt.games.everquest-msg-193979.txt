Heh, your guild is much further along than the one I'm in, but we have the same
learning arc; wiped on first AOW and lost the spawn (much screaming from other
guilds for wasting one), took down second in a long hard fight by the skin of
our teeth, killled third one in half that time with 10 fewer people, killed
fourth one so easily we were thinking he might have switched name tags with
Vindi!  We do learn.

Two things occur to me.  Watch out with that trick in POP, be dissapointing to
be dragged almost into position and then have corpse pop to graveyard...and
worse to be rezed and find body popped to GY while you were zoning in, so all
your gear is back at the zone line!

Second, when you want someone to kill you, click virtue and any other HP buffs
off.  Should cut their time to kill in half, and its not a pain like taking off
your HP gear.  After all, you are going to lose all buffs anyway on death.
Sitting shouldn't be necessary, if the rogue is so low level and poorly equipped
he can't take down an unbuffed cleric in a few backstabs without help you can
enjoy mocking him for it while he demonstrates that fact.  I wouldn't bet on it
though.
