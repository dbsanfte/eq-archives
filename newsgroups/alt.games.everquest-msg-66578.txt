i went up to luclin to get some wizard gear and cheap upper level spells
(ill get there eventually) but upon getting there, i saw 7 or 8
vendors...but noting for casters...i found 1 vendor with 2 wizard spells
(two lvl 44 spells at 8 plat each) but they were just sell backs

getting frustrated, i gated back to Gfay

should i have given up so easliy? (im thinkin a trip back to luclin is in
order, but i have no clue where to look)

thx
