I am so happy that was fixed .  Now all I have to do is get the drum
=).  Have Selos Drum of the March which isn't a bad drum at all.
But that extra help on the resists is a must in many situations.  My
DOT's getting a boost will help a bit too.

Have the Luclin songs been fixed and do they now work in planes?
Been busy and not been able to get in much playing time the past 2
weeks.
