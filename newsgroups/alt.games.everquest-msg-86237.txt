No, Tom, you don't have to pay for the second month.  You must either,
purchase the game, or get the free version from some magazine.  If you
purchase the game, your first month is free, but you will have to enter
billing information.  If you cancel before the month is up, then you will
not be billed.  If you get the free magazine version, I understand that you
get a free 10 day trial, other than that, same as buying the game.  It is
supposed to also be on a seperate server, but I have heard that it is not.
