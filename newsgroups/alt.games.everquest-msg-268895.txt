most of the quests that give weapons or armor have a choice of more than 
one reward.  For example: cloth, leather, or plate version of the 
breastplate being offered.  Too bad it don't tell you reward before you 
start.  I did over 200 quests in beta, there's no way I can tell you which 
of those even gave rewards any more.  (8 more hours till I can go out and 
buy my copy of EQ2)
