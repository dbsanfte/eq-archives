I pick neither of your options. I choose c) "Absor doesnt' answer the
fucking question until he talks to somebody who *knows* the answer
first."

That response was propogated over more discussion fora across Usenet/Web

Discussion and clarification with the public: Good.
Passing out bullshit answers without checking your facts: Bad
