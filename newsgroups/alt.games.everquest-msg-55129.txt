This would be more akin to wearing "cloth armor" in the game. All you
know is it's cloth armor, you don't know who made it. I can tell the
difference between, say, combat boots and riding boots at a glance.
That is a more apt comparison.

Again, it is quite apt. The inspection doesn't tell the details about
the item. It's combat boots vs riding boots, not Joe brand boots vs
Bob brand boots. If you're wearing banded armor in the game, all I
know is it's banded armor, I don't know that, say, Zanthis the
magician made it...
