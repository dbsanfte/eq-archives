Try looking up shards of dalaya.

After paying �10 a month for approx 3 years, plus expansions (rough total
�450), I personally wouldnt give two shits about someone running a private

It would only ever be taken down if it was being paid for by subscribers
(Shards is run, or was run, by donations).
