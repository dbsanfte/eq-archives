Heh, some guild mates and I killed the Fabled Allizusar in OOT while we were
looking for shark fins for our sparklers.  He hit for 1998,
unsnareable/rootable, mitigates slow, summons, and has farily decent
resists.  Was a fun fight for an item that we gave to a passer-by.  His drop
is the fabled blue diamond.

I camped the Fabled Journeyman's Boots.  Was quite a bit of fun.  There was
a line of people already there when I arrived at 10:30 am.  I was number 10
when I joined the list.  We all sat around chatting and having a good time.
No one was complaining about having to wait for the spawn and no one ninjaed
any boots.  By 2:30pm when I got my pair I had almost regained my faith in
the quality of the general player base; that is until I was subjected to the
ooc comments of BoT while my guild was backflaging members for Agnar.
