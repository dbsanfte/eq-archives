Just one thing to add, you don't need snare to kite, I do it all the time
with my Shaman, just have to keep myself SoWed, and sometimes levitated too.
The levitate works particularly well in zones like FM where you can use the
terrain as your snare.  Not sure how well it would work for a cleric, but a
cleric can root, flash, nuke a mob, reapplying root and flash as needed.
Works great for my Shaman, when I am in an area where kiting is not a good
idea.
