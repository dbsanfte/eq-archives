Have to agree with the ToFS. I set the tower as a goal for our small guild
to conquer. We did it one floor at a time and now we can take the entire
twoer in no time at all with a group of six 45 - 53 without any problems.
A few things you hsould be aware of though. Get several keys to each floor
and have the spare keys in the bank. The keys are NOT soulbound which can
create major problems.  Have casters that can cast IVU and invis. Some
floors require different invises and once you can take a floor you might
want to just get past that floor and go on. Pathing on the floor with the
wedding party really sucks for pets. When I take my mage to that floor I
typically dump my pet and just get one on the next floor. The floors get
progressively worse each floor (but I think the wedding party floor is
actually easier than the floor below it).
This is a great place to learn to work together as a guild. Its also a
dungeon that you can start out around mid 30 and still get xp in your low
50s. The loot is not too bad, and drops are not too rare.
