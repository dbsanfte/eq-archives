Unfortunately Biz, that's not entirely true, the requirements for EQ even
without SoL have gone up.  You now must use DX8.1, which means you cannot
use Win95.  Also video card support has changed, a lot of people have been
playing with built in Intel graphics, they can't anymore.  As to Billy, put
him up for adoption, that will leave a lot more time for EQ.
