Well, I've seen some nice people arrive on Stormhammer, firmly believing
that the server is such a wonderful place, only to be bitterly disappointed
after a week or so. I was on-line only last night when I happened to strike
up a conversation with someone that told me *she* was told that she wasn't
allowed to bring *no-drop* items from her server to Stormhammer. Sadly, she
was very hasty and didn't check her source information so she duly went
about deleting *all* of her items that were no-drop - including the Epic!
This seems almost unbelievable, but she told me herself and is currently
setting about doing another Epic!

I have to say that I'm not *really* a quest person, so the events (or lack
thereof) don't *really* matter that much to me. What I'm annoyed about is
the total lack of imagination with some of these *events* - PvP 99% of the
time is very boring, and not what most of us on Stormhammer were lead to
believe we'd be getting. Virtually everyone that has spoken to me during
play has at some point indicated to me that Stormhammer is indeed a rip off.
I agree, it's never worth the money, but I enjoy the atmosphere of not
having to put up with the kids, that's why I stay.

I have only played on two servers, my original server and Stormhammer, and
whilst I'd be the last to tar every server with the same brush, I'd be very
surprised if any of the servers don't have their fare share of KSer's,
idiots, scammers and the like. With regard to a role-playing *Legends*
server the answer is no, as Legends is a one-off unique server. However,
there *are* role-playing servers as well as PvP servers - you can find out
which server offers what (role-play or PvP when you're at the server log-in
screen.

Glad to have been some help at least. Maybe other Stormhammer players will
jump in and argue against my points thus giving you the urge to make the
move. If that is the case, and you do move to Stormhammer then yes, it'd be
great to see you there. My advice (again) level up, enjoy the game, learn
your character's strengths and weaknesses, and try to get some half-decent
gear before making the move. Many things on Stormhammer are *way*
over-priced, hence rather a lot of people come from their old servers with
decent gear, and then sell for a huge profit on Stormhammer before moving
back.

Best of luck to you in whatever you decide to do ..

Stevie.
