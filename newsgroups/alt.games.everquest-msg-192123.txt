Then make a character that is more group oriented.  Cleric, Enchanter,
Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard, maybe a couple
others.

Also the levels before about 50 suck ass now for grouping, as most
people below that fly through with twinked or pl'd characters.  Those
who do group mostly don't know wtf they are doing and make it safer to
solo (at least to my now lv 31 cleric it seems that way - I group anyway
when I have the time though).

Lastly if you want a group go where the groups are and get a pickup
group or start one.  It's a bit easier with the lfg/lfp tool.
