Sure it is.  Lousy DPS output.  No utility.  All they can do is
evac.  One thing.  That is the one and only thing that makes the
wizard class special.

Their ability to port is handy, but even that is second-best.
Druids can port you...then sow you for the remainder of your
journey, and maybe throw a few buffs on you.  (Besides, on my
server, most people are taking the Luclin shortcut these days.)

(Disclaimer: I've only played my wizard to high 20s.  I keep
hoping things will get better at higher levels.)

: Clerics and warriors can be boring too, yet
: they are valued in groups.

"Boring but valuable" sure beats "boring" alone.

: Blowing up 10-20 mobs at one time with an
: earth shattering spell can be pretty entertaining.

But...it's not.

First, most groups pull one -- maybe two -- mobs at a time.
Blowing up 20 mobs at a time?  Please.  How often does that
happen?

Second, AoE spells are extremely dangerous (repeat disclaimer:
I've only played my wizard to high 20s).  I'd almost rename
them, "Hey, mobs, all of you, come aggro me now!  Worst AC
and HP in the game!  I'll go down fast!" spells.

Anything extremely narrow and repetitive gets boring.  I miss
my druid and mage which could do all sorts of useful things.
My wizard can nuke.  And nuke, and nuke, and nuke.  Perhaps
"nuking many things at once" floats *your* boat...but it's
just teeny tiny variation on "nuke" to me.

: More entertaining
: that casting CH on a tank over and over, or pressing the bash button,
: imo.

Again..."boring but valuable" sure beats "boring" alone...

: Also, I play on a PvP server, where wizards get to nuke, nuke, nuke,
: yawn, yawn, yawn at other players, which helps to alleviate some
: boredom.

I tried RZ for a while.  I hated it.
