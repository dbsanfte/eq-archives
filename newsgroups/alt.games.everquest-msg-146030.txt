>>** Experience Changes **
- We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60.  This should mitigate
the "penalty effect" that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59.  Note that it will
cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did before.  Also,
death experience loss will appear different in some levels.  This is an
unfortunate side effect that must remain to prevent some experience
exploits.
- We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over level
50.  NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you less
experience.  NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, and for
the best results you should fight the most challenging monsters you can
reasonably manage.  <<

All this accomplishes is to give those power players that already have over
50 - 100 AA points an unfair advantage.
