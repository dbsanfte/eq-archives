    Interesting data point: one of my guildmates was recently hacked. Not
hacked as in gave his account info to someone else, or had a keystroke
trojan running on his machine, but flat-out hacked. As he works at a law
firm which has a fair number of computer-literate lawyers, he initiated
legal action to find the perp and sue him. As soon as the subpoena got to
SOE, they contacted him, restored everything to the account, and threw in
perks which my guildmate cannot disclose in return for him dropping the
suit. They might own the account, but they seem extra keen on not having any
case which could assign a value to an account go to court.
