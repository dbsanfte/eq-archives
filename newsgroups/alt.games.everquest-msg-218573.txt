The two statements are equivalent. Sooner or later your vague assertion 
that 'some people with serious genetic issues who choose to breed is 
irresponsible' has to boil down to a concrete instance of a real couple, 
with a particular serious genetic defect choosing to breed, and then you 
will be there telling them they are being irresponsible (and presumably 
should not do it.)

While your vauge assertion 'sounds reasonable' it can never be applied 
to an actual case. As soon as you've got a real couple with a real 
disease then you'll find yourself looking at an insurance company's meat 
chart... if you have this disease and this income and this risk then you 
should be shot... otherwise go ahead. And the problem is that in this 
case nobody is qualified to make the meat chart. (Hell even in insurance 
the balance of risk, compassion, and cold economics and profitablity is 
a nasty business, but insurance is a necessary evil... eugenics isn't.

No. Down syndrome is serious, Huntington's is serious, Diabetes is 
serious, Sever athsma and allergy is serious... many of these can be 
overcome or coped with, and many people suffering from them would be 
outraged if you suggested they ought not have been born, or that their 
parents made a mistake by having them.

Even massive mental retardation... many of these people are happy, 
granted they don't ever see the world beyond the level of a 12 month old 
baby. But so what, what makes that wrong? If they can lead a happy life, 
and bring joy to their families, despite the fact that they will never 
be able to understand even that anything is 'wrong' with them, who am I 
to say this person shouldn't live.

Probably.

Doctors only have one perspective, what about what the accountants 
think? What about what the various Churches think?

What about what the parents values are, shouldn't that be the most 
important factor? Its their kid after all!!

But its a key point. As soon as you advocate that some authority gets to 
decide who gets born and who doesn't you open that can of worms. Who has 
that authority is extremely controversial... and most people don't think 
anybody has that authority, or can be trusted with it. As much as 
'you'd' like their to be a 'reliably compassionate objective authority' 
such a entity isn't available to us. Working with what we do have: 
special interest groups, political agendas, corporations driven by 
capitalist mandates, corrupted and corruptable people, outright whackos, 
etc... how does one assemble a panel.

Your idea of 'several doctors' for example... if they're assigned by the 
government then dubba bush has a direct hand in the people he chooses do 
you really trust him to put a balanced group together?  If they're 
elected then marketing and money will taint the process? If they're 
'volunteers' then the Kevorkians and Hitlers will line up at the door to 
further their agendas. [Not saying Kevorkian and Hitler belong in the 
same sentence... just illustrating that they both have 'special 
interests' that are not entirely in line with the rest of society]

You and I shouldn't be the decding factor. And nobody you or I can point 
at should be either.

My bad. Confused you with the other poster who asserted that he wasn't 
having children because he expected to pass on some condition he 
inherited from his parent & grandparent.
