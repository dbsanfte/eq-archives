Whats wrong with having an 8 man group as standard instead of 6? Why wont
SOE introduce this? (not raid groups).
SOE want to promote grouping so much they say, but at high levels its hard
to get groups because you need the standard lineup etc... which leaves few
open slots for grabs. Is SOE just being gay?
