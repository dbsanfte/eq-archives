Not to mention it's very much a 'world'...with more than 2 cities. :P I find 
it much more enjoyable than EQ2, and on a note per earlier posts in this 
thread, groups aren't hard to find in WoW. I'm more the solo player (and I 
like soloing in a multiplayer game...multiplayer to me means I can interact 
with others if I want to, not that I'm forced to), but I've been in several 
groups and have enjoyed my gaming experience immensely on WoW. On EQ2, I had 
to force myself to play and finally just asked myself why? Went back to 
regular EQ at that point, then finally got a copy of WoW and never looked 
back at EQ2. The lore is rich and varied, the content is great, and the 
world is huge. My only beef is that the trolls look like punk rockers and 
talk like Jamaicans. :P
