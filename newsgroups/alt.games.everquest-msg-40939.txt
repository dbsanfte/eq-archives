Last night instead of killing things in Qeynos (everything conned green
anyway) I listened to all the shouts and everything and heard a lot of SoW
stories, so, since there was only one or two druids and a plethera of  CRs
to do, I decided to help out the best I could, I figured, I had a drum,
Selo's Accelerando and Lyssa's Locating Lyric.  I could not only give people
the speed they wanted, but I could also.......

All this now seems so inconsequential (spelling?) after seeing on the news
the destruction in New York  everything else that is happening today.
Please keep a prayer in your hearts to whichever god you pray to (if any)
for all those who paid the ultimate sacrifice today.

thanks

Scott Fourier
