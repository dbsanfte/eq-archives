I answered that as it was written.  You can think it's stupid all you want,
doesn't change the fact that it's true.  Can't find one or two mobs to kill
in two minutes?  Jeez, turn on run, push that clipping plane out, something,
cause you're obviously having some severe computer problems.

No, I'm right, period.  Are there 50 mobs in EC green to a level 60?  I'd
imagine there are.  And how long do you think it takes a level 60 monk to
kill 50 green mobs?  A hint, if the second, third and fourth swings of a
good quad could hit separate mobs, I could drop 4 per _second_ of most EC
mobs.  Druids don't seem to be that great at green-mowing, play a good melee
damage dealer sometime and you'll see.

Would only be useful if you could selectively pick up the platinum and/or
gold and leave the rest.  I usually don't drop platinum until I'm riding the
edge of the weight limit.
