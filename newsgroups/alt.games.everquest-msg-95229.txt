Well, bards don't get AE songs until 52, so it's probably not that.  
However, almost all bard buffs are group buffs, so you can get aggro when 
a Dragoon takes a dislike to one of your groupmates.  I know that the few 
times I fought in OT, I was OK with my dark elf illusion up, but I did get 
aggro from my groupmates.  I too worship that crafty little halfling, and 
while the evil blue guys don't approve, I haven't noticed too much trouble 
with them (other than in Neriak itself).
Bardsongs are a bit odd on aggro.  If you have a song up, and a groupmate 
gets aggro, you generally we not be added to the hate list, UNLESS you 
start a new song.  I *think* the level 32 manasong is an exception, though 
I'm not sure.  I do know that I used to fight in Velk's Village with my 
faction adjusted to non-KOS (back when you could do that without werewolf 
form) and had no problem with trains if I was singing the level 55 
manasong.

Yeah, just keep Selos loaded, and run like a frightened schoolgirl if you 
get in trouble.

runs away very well
