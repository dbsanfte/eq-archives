I don't know if you're American or not, but the fact that I have no idea 
what is involved in running a country also does not keep me from speaking 
up about what I feel is right or wrong about the actions of the 
President, either. I can have an opinion, and it can still be valid, 
without being an expert in the matter.

Now, I didn't mean to imply that the current trials implementation is 
without flaw. Yes, I think there should be a way for more than one group 
to attempt them at a time. As I understand it, there are several 
different trials though, right? So, when it is said that only one group 
can try it at a time, does that mean that only one group can try the 
*easiest* trial at a time?

Also, from the sound of it, the requirements for being able to complete 
the trials successfully are a bit steep. That doesn't mean that the idea 
of the trials is a bad one.

Don't take such offense to differing opinions. They can be better for you 
than what you're actually arguing for.
