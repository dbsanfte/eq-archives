Exactly.  The difference is that you won't be going on a 7 hour guild
raid with 36 people to get one guy a 30 percent haste item, then have
it wear out later. Instead you'll be getting gradual upgrades from
drops and GOOD player made items as you can afford/have the prowess to
go out and get them. If done right by the time you'd be looking to
upgrade slow decay would be moot. 

Decay of such uber rare gear, that is so hard to come by and takes the
work of so many people, in the game Everquest would be catostrophic.
Meanwhile, in my 2 months of AO I can't remember gear decaying but if
it did I'd not even notice because you replaced your gear SO DAMN FAST
in that game from missions and upgrades (in fact, it was really too
fast for my taste.. it was CONSTANT, like every play session)

Also, they have not really defined this clearer. it may be that only
regular mundane things wear down and if you are getting higher end
gear whether drops or player made it won't.
