The guid Sh*t he is talking about is when you apply to become a GM in the
gam eyou have to complete a list of questions. Most of the questions you
listed are on that very same test, so what ever site you got them from, they
more than likly copied them from the application( and could be hopeing
someone would answer them for him?). If you have played for a bit most of
theses are pretty easy questions.

Big Smiles!!!
