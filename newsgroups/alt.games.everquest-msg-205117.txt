The problem is that the quality of droppable equipment that a low level 
can equip has improved drastically over time, thus making the stuff that 
a low level can attain by killing mobs pale in comparison to what he can 
buy in the bazaar, or pass down from his high level character.  There was 
a time, way back when, when low level players did wear what they looted, 
and were happy to get it.
