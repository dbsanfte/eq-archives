This can be done without the Pet Hold aa discipline, just use /pet guard and
play with distances, eventually you will find you can have your pet far away
enough, that it will ignore you being damaged, unless you tell it /pet
follow, then it comes arunning!

I use it for pulling casters, who likely cast on me as a response to me
slowing/nuking them to pull them.
If you are really close to the zone, there may not be enough room to do it
this way.
