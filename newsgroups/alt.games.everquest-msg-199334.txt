Its actually possible for Zytool (or Zytl, or whatever his name is) and Gix
to be up at the same time. But Zytool spawns over near the entrance to
Befallen when he pops.

I make it a habit to go kill Gix every time I set foot in WC as my main,
then hand Zytool his head if he comes near me.

Yeah, I know a lot of people want revenge on Holly for killing them when she
catches them killing bears or wolves, even if the animals aggroed on them
first. At least Zigg's easy to avoid by staying away from the Jewelry
shop.....unless someone else has aggroed him.

Don't forget that new Halfling NPC they added to EC a while back, Jimble
Woodentoe or whatever he's called. Every newbie DE who's ever set foot in
that zone probably has an arrow or a spell with his name on it.
