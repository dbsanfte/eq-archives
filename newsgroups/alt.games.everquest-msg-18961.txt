"If it didn't get thru at all then...."  -  Huh?  If what didnt get thru at
all?  I suppose I'm just used to BBS message bases that allowed attachments.
Besides I really didnt feel like changing around HTML just for one pic that
I probably wouldn't have kept up permenantly. :)

Though, no single person will ever please everyone in the world.  So.  If
they flame they flame.  I appologized, tis all I really can do since I
cannot delete posts, else I would.
