I hope this isn't a troll.

Ruined pelts drop like flies off of wolves
in Gfay, and off of wolves and polar bear cubs in Everfrost.
They are all super-easy kills.

In Everfrost especially, you can gather 10 ruined in 10 or 15 minutes.   Just
run up and down cub highway there and slaughter like mad.  Try to stay away from
slaughtering near the newbie area, though, so that they have some prey to
play with.
