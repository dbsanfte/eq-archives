Well, let me tell you from personal experience... there is a small but
significant difference between someone who's soloed their way to 50+ and
someone who's grouped their way there.  The soloist will need prompting for
buffs, will need to be told how to position themselves in melee, will not
know *anything* about aggro management...

Now that's a slight exaggeration.  You can teach yourself about these issues
and listen to what people tell you.  But the difference between the soloist
and the grouper is that the grouper will know these kind of things
*instinctively* and react very quickly.  The soloist will have to pause,
think things over, figure out what's happening, and then react - by which
time the chanter's dead and the cleric is OOM and screaming for an evac.

I've met people who solo'd their way to 60 and are guildless and useless in
high-end groups, so they spend all their time in Velk's building up AAXP and
being denied access to the high-end game because they have no clue how to
play their character.  And I've seen people solo their way to 60, then slip
into a high-end guild and learn their roles quickly and be a wonderful
addition.  I think the people you met were rudely trying to make the point
that you'll be more likely to become a good player if you learn early on how
group dynamics work.

The first character I got above 20 was a cleric who became my main.  He
*had* to group, as clerics are about the worst soloists out there - perhaps
tied with warriors.  I got to 60 and know all about grouping and stuff.  But
I started a Beastlord alt, because darnit... it's *nice* to solo once in a
while.  =)  It's nice to be able to do whatever the heck you want to
whenever the heck you want to without worrying if the chanter has to log
soon.
