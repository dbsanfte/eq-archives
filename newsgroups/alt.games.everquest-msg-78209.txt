Just a touch OT, yes.  I think of Star Wars as nothing more than
swashbucklers in space, extremely well done, highly entertaining, but not a
work of art.  Not sure that I would call The Matrix a work of art either,
but I loved the movie, and certainly found it to be a lot more thought
provoking than Star Wars.
