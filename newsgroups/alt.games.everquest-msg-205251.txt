The cleric epic IS the most useful epic, IMO, but there are others
that are still very useful.  The bard epic in particular is still
extremely useful; although there are now other non-instrument items
with instrument mods, the epic is still a very useful weapon since it
adds power to any song, no matter what that song's instrument mod is. 
All the items ith instrumental mods on them are from upper Planes,
anyway, and as such, many bards will never see them.

Also, people tend to forget that in most cases, the stats on the epics
are very good.  There are only a couple of cases I can think of where
the effort is no longer worthwhile for the epic, because either the
effort is insane vs. the payoff (mage) or items with better stats and
effects are available readily now (necro, SK, etc.)
