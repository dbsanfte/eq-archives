Much like casters with offensive spells, Rangers are one of the few
melee classes that can do some fair damage from a distance. Bow kiting
involves snaring a mob (and/or getting SoW on yourself... either way,
making sure you can stay well ahead of the mob in persuit) and just
plinking away with arrows at them and refreshing snare/SoW as needed.

Trying to do this at early levels is going to go through a TON of
arrows, but could be used to get your archery skill up there. I
understand at the high levels you can get Endless Quiver and have a
neverending supply of arrows for a job like this. There may also be some
equipment that summons arrows, but I'm not positive of that. I'm sure
there's one that summons hammers and bandages. 

> Why are your arrows so much money?

I was wondering that myself. My Ranjah is totally untwinked, but I'm
really not putting a dent in my meager cash reserves with the low level
arrows. I just last night finished making up a fresh batch of the second
lowest skill arrows and getting my fletching to 31 in the process.
(Field points, wooden shafts, cheapest fletch and the medium nocks,
rather than large nocks.) I think it cost me just over 1 plat to make 9
stacks (180 arrows) which is enough to fill up my ammo slot and my
entire fletching kit with them.

I think my best to date at level 14 is still 39 so I'd say you're doing
ok.
