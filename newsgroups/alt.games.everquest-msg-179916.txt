The Great Sense Heading Trick:

1. Make Sense Heading one of your hot keys.
2. Go into Options, Keyboard and map that hot key to the "forward" key.  For
instance, my key for moving forward is "w" and my hot key for Sense Heading
is "0", so the "0" hot key is mapped to both "0" and "w".
3. Every time you go forward you'll try to Sense Heading.  Before you know
it you'll max out the skill.
4. Be careful with other hot key banks, you might do something odd when you
try to go forward.
