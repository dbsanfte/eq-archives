Once again, with how much you've "been told."

Not even a 65 druid from Meemer's guild can solo the druid epic.

Can a sinlge group do it where it used to take a 35 person raid to kill
Faydear, yes...  but solo, no chance.

They can probably solo everything up to Ullump, VSR and Faydear, but in none
of those zones is there anything charmable that a druid can use as a pet.
How exactly are they going to injure Ullump, who is, if not 100%, damn near
immune to magic?   Is the druid going to melee it down?   Porcupine like it
was a mid 20's experience mob?   Maybe he can even use treeform for added
bonus points.
