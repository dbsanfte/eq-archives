I don't play anymore, moved on to other games, but when I used to play EQ, I
would notice alot of stuff, I was low lvl but this should work for high
lvls, like Spider Silks would be spread across lots of vendors and they
weren't selling, most ppl dont want to get 2 or 3 silks each from 20 diff
vendors, so I would run around and buy up all the silks under 6 plat and
resell for 8 plat each and make a nice profit, did this with lots of stuff
just used silk as example.  Perhaps you could try this with Gargoyle Granite
or some other item lots of people tend to buy in the bazaar.
