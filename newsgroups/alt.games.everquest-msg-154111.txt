	Not only are Rangers not getting nerfed, we're getting some tasty new
spells in PoP.  Guardian of the Forest looks like it doesn't suck, either.
Depends on what the refresh time is like.

	And currently on Test: the Defense skill cap for Rangers post-50 has been
raised to 240.  Remains to be seen if it goes live, of course.  Does seem that
someone at Verant finally noticed that Beastlords at 235 didn't really make
sense with Rangers at 220.

	Looks like good times ahead for Rangers to me.
