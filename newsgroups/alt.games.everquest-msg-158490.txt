They almost have that now.  Its called the epic.  96% rez available free to
everyone, pretty much, because few clerics charge for a click.   When epics were
few and far between, this didn't have all that much effect, most people donated
for a rez or at least tried to.  With Ragefire spawnable, there is now a
presumption that rez is free.  Not that I mind one bit.  100% rez machine in the
graveyard wouldn't bother me at all.

If you made that a 96% rez machine, though, you'd have a situation more
comperable to what druids have now.  They aren't needed for simple taxi duties,
its easy enough to get from one part of the world to the next.  But they are
needed for battlefield ports; succor to get your group out of a bad fix or just
to let you easily move to a different part of the zone, regular ports to get you
out when its time to leave (instead of running all the way to the nearest city)
and evac and more specific ports to get you closer to the more interesting zones
(yes, its possible to get anywhere without a port, but try this:  run to nearest
PoK portal.  In PoK run to GD portal.  Run EW KD WL SS CS.  Druid could have
taken you to CS in one click)

Similarly, a 96% rez machine in every zone would still require a full fledged CR
or SC to get your body to the machine, then you'd have to start breakin all over
again.  Graveyard zones would make this simpler, but the ten minute wait would
guarantee repops in your way.  A rez on site would be preferable... but noone
would be begging you to come several zones away to rez them; as a rezer you
would be using the ability only to make your own group's lives easier.

KEI machine wouldn't be a bad thing either.  Sitting around in nexus shouting
KEI for donations is not exactly the heroic image of a powerful adventurer,
people don't do it because its fun or exciting, they do it because if they need
money its the simplest and fastest way for them to earn it, risk free.
Enchanters are far more useful to a group than as jewlery makers, and to me, at
least, the fact that they can clarity is the least of the benefits of having one
around.  If you want to make it a cornerstone of the class, though, the key
would be to nerf the duration of KEI, not to provide it via machine.  Might as
well have a machine in nexus now as far as thats concerned, because I havent'
been there in a month where I couldn't get KEI for 100pp in thirty seconds.

Your warrior idea, now, shows how little you understand the issue.  Cleric rez,
druid port, chanter clarity; these are all peripheral benefits of the class,
having little to do with the role of those classes in battle.  Take them away or
water them down, and you do reduce demand for them a bit, but you really
wouldn't alter what one would do in your party or for your party one bit in a
fight.  Since warriors don't contribute any peripheral benefits, the only thing
you could think of to nerf them out of is that "during the fight" thing.  Its
not comperable.

Trivial mind numbing exercises that pose no risk and merely force people to beg
other people to do them favors or whore themselves out can be automated.
Soulbinders saved an enourmous amount of annoyance; for every level 12 caster
who suddenly saw his binding money slashed you see a hundred higher level
casters who no longer felt obligated to come bind all the poor melee so they
could finally go fight without a nightmare CR should something go wrong... and a
hundred more melee and sub 12/14 casters who didn't have to debase themselves
any longer just to move to a new fighting zone.  KEI, Drag to me Rez... not bad
ideas at all.  Firepots, Nexus, and now PoK ports; this takes out much of the
reason to waste play time wandering around offering simple taxi services (port
to port) and begging for those services, so players can concentrate on actually
doing things instead of standing on a street corner in a flimsy dress.

Whining is a transitive verb.  I offer a reasoned opinion.  You complain.  He
whines.
