Freaky thing happend to my dru last night, waiting at the NK spires for the
port up.  I noticed I had the Nexus(or Norrath) Scion or something - anyway,
the one that *isn't* visible but that you can track - sitting there in my
target box.  I didn't intentionally target it and when I clicked on the
person-scion it was an entirely different mob.

Anyway, the freaky thing was, I was sitting there in form of the howler and
when I conned the Nexus whatever in my target box, it was blue scowling!!!
Needless to say I quickly stepped back and dropped FoTH but couldn't
reaquire the target to re-con it.

Anyone else run into this??
