Aye, definately one of the more enjoyable parts of the game for me.  I love
the look on a newbie's face when you give them that Finely Balanced Fer'Esh
or Polished Bone Bracer, throw in some buffs, etc and tell them to have fun.

Gives me a sense of doing something good, rather than the hum-drum slaying
of mobs...
