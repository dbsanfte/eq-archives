Creating a sepererate toon to do your tradeskills is not always a
cunning plan, a lot depends on your reasons for learning trades. 
These days there is little or no money to be made from tradeskills
unless you are right at the top end unlike when I started & made a
fortune with jewelery but that was pre kunark.

Virtually all of the people I know who have high skills (min 150 in
everything) have done so for quest purposes, be it Coldain Shawl,
Solstice earring or some of the PoP items.  In these cases there is an
aweful lot of No Drop bits involved & certainly for the later items
you are going to need to have over 200 in multiple skills therefore
you'll need to spend some AA as well as a lot of PP to get there.

Personally I'd concentrate your skills on your main charachter,
particularly if your are a class that can wear the 7th shawl & forget
the alt.  If you were keen to make a toon to help I'd suggest making a
chanter & leveling him to lvl 12.  To advance your tailoring to a
decent level (158) your going to need a huge amount of vials of mana.
