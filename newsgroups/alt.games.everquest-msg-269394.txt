You might wish to wait for the "more solo quests" promised Real Soon
Now. Real XP in EQ2 isn't from grinding, it's from quests. 

Frig, I went from 63%at 16th level to Ding 17 by finishing the three
butterfly collection quests. 

Lizard says: Never waste time killing anything you're not being
quested to kill, unless it's in between you and a quest target. (Or
you're helping a guildie do THEIR quests, in which case, try to pick
it up yourself.)
