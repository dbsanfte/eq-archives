I just realized at 17 that I could start dodge at 15.  So I went and put a
point into it.  It seems really hard to gain in it cause my melee is so bad
I keep getting hit too much.  Is this just a stupid skill for a druid or how
can I get better at it?  Would it be worth using up training points on?
