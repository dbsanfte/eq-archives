I have

/gsay Mezzing a %T, do not attack it
/cast (mez slot)

Then for next mob i have

/gsay Next mob is %t

Also a handy one for later

/gsay Switch target to %t

this is for when a non mezzable or difficult to mez mob comes in. Fighters
switch to that mob and then you mez the half killed previous target
