Great thinking.  Anyone know if it works?  I wouldn't try this in a LDON
though.
My ranger is usually needed for DPS in a LDON group (at 57 even being a master
at archery my bow won't do near the damage as my dual wield weapons).  Since
there's a time limit I don't plonk arrows unless we have completed the mission.
