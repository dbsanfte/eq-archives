I just installed Velious earlier this week, after Luclin.  No problems, but
just remember to patch Velious so you don't get the "Every mob looks like a
naked human" problem.  I didn't install the "Velious Re-texture" when I
first installed Luclin, but I suppose if you pop in the Luclin CD and choose
to install only that it would probably work ok.
