INT/Mana > All

Choice number one is your play. Unless you opt for number 3 and are just
saving up money to get an even bigger INT/Mana item. However, at your
level, and mostly in cloth, 2K will get you an AMAZING treasure trove of
stuff in the bazaar. Admittedly at my level and gear, it costs more than
that now to squeak out upgrades, but I'm betting you could more than
double your current manapool for 2K from the traders.

Look, go into the bazaar, open up the interface, and do a search for
Stat=INT and Class=Wizard. To make your job even easier, just pick out
all the slots where you have cloth, or other no INT/Mana items and add
that slot into the search parameters. Start scrolling through the items
that are in an affordable price range. (Say, under 1K PP, with a
preference for things that are far less.) For each one you come across,
right click on the item name, check it's INT/Mana stats and then open
your inventory and see how they stack up against what you're wearing.
You should quickly be able to determine what the cheapest item is out
there that will give you the biggest INT/Mana bang for your buck in each
slot.

At level 29 in cloth, you're Mana pool pretty much sucks. For 2K you
could seriously expand it and thereby expand the possibilities of what
you can start killing? Remember, you just got Bonds of Force when you
hit 29. (Very possibly the most important spell you will EVER get,
transition-wise, in your wizardly career. This is where wizards come
alive!) It's time to get out there and start quadding, my boy! And
you'll need all the mana you can wrangle up.  Get out there and start
shopping.
