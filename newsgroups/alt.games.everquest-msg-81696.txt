The trip to Firiona Vie via the shuttles in Butcher Block is safe and
fun (though a little long for my tastes).

Once in FV you should bind at the bank area (look at a map of the
zone).

At level 18 you will want to head to Lake of Ill Omen. This zone is
adjacent to FV, but you will have to run through some semi-dangerous
territory to get there. Again look at a map. As you leave FV you will
see a huge Iksar statue. A river is running into the ocean through the
statues legs. You follow this river up the side of a hill to zone into
LoIO. It is a short run, but you have to pass through an area
patrolled by Drachnids (low-mid 30s half-Darkelf half-spider creatures
with Ranger spells root, snare, etc) and goblins. Most if not all can
see through invis, so be sure to have SoW and Camo won't hurt. If you
get rooted or snared, you will most likely die without help.

I have made the run with several characters levels 17-30 (at least
50-70 times). I was only killed once, when I got lazy and ran right
over a drachnid that rooted me. If you run fast and dodge wide of the
mobs you should make it just fine.

Once you zone into LoIO bind at the zone and start hunting. Solo or
grouped LoIO can take you all the way to 30 if you can stand to be
there that long.
