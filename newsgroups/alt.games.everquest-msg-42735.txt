It is also possible that I, as a druid or wizard, am enjoying myself in an area
that would be annoying to return, or I'm holding a camp that I would likely loose
if I left, or I'm part of a group that is depending on my continued presense. 10pp
to drop everything and port you? Sorry, I am making more than that already and
it's not worth the hassle. 100pp? That might cover the cost of giving up my camp,
putting my group on hold as well as the waste of time and hassle returning to my
fun.
