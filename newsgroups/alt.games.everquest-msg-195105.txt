Do you have Run on?  Are you Ducked?  Using Selos for move speed?  Perhaps you
are circling too tightly, or relying on PBAE dots?  Or your lag time is really
really bad...  I'm on a 56K modem and really don't have this problem much at all.

Bards solo as well as any class in the low levels (when everyone is capable of
tanking about as well as anyone else) and better than many (twist DOT, heal,
haste, for example, while meleeing).  Later they lag behind in melee capability
and start having to rely on lower level mob kills and their low down time to
average same exp per hour, or start chant/dd killing things.  Once they hit 27,
though, they become one of the best solo classes in the game, because its very
very hard to outdamage 3 or 4 mobs your level.  Your pet beats on one mob, and it
and a couple more beat on him.  After a bit, you break charm and finish him off,
then pick a new pet and repeat.  All the damage that your pet and the other mobs
do is directed at killing things that you will get experience for, and at no mana
cost.

This slows down some in your upper 30s as you can't charm pets higher than 37
with this song, but then at 39 you get a new charm that works in many ways better
than the last, although at the cost of a little mana.  With this song plus more
DOT songs a bard is a serious soloing machine well into his 50s (I can't speak
past 57, but I'm still using 39 charm plus DOTs to exp nicely in POD)

Necromancers can kill a mob faster (but not necessarily two mobs faster).  Druids
and wizards can kill 4 mobs faster... but then have to sit on their butts
regening lost mana.  Chanters can use the same charm idea as you but have to keep
their pet alive, so they lose the "four mobs all doing damage" plan.

Something that you might look into as a soloing bard is JBoots or TBoots, less
speed but you don't have to keep selos up or keep drinking SOW potions or begging
for SOW.
