It gets better.  JMS has told the B5 newsgroup that he's waiting to hear
about the feasibility on two seperate *new* B5 projects.  Evidently the
DVD sales shocked a lot of people, so they are trying again. He's said
they aren't TV shows in the normal fashion, so we are guessing movie or
mini-series.  No guarentee of course, but JMS has a habit of not saying
anything until they have a good chance of happening, so it's enough to
make me excited.
