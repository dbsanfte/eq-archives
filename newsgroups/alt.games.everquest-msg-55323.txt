IMHO, people are WAY too afraid of kithicor, my warrior ran from WC to
Highpass at night all the time, unSoWed, only once did I get aggroed ("YOU
writhe in the grip of agony for 341 points of damage") but I was SoWed so I
was ok.

Just don't get off the zone edge for any reason, if there's a dread wolf or
something up there in your way, wait about 2 minutes and it'll wander off.

Its fun to sit at one of the zone lines (Rivervale and Highpass especially)
and watch the undead spawn on track on my druid.  Then run to WC and laugh
at the train. =P
