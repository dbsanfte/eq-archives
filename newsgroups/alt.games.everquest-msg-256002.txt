In a nutshell, Riposte Damage is the Devil. :)

What I mean by that is that all melee types ( Rangers, Monks, Rogues Warr's
etc.. ) who are NOT the Main tank should be attacking from the side / rear,
as a mob cant riposte from that attack arc.  It increases your damage output
slightly, and conserves the helaers mana a bit, as your not taking damage
from any ripostes.
