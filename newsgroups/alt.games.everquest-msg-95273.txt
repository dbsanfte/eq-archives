  A thousand more spammers will come
afterward- can you "kill" them all?  Or
are you targetting this one in particular
because you don't like what he said?

  Glad to see you learned something from his
post.  Getting him banned for what he said
would only prove him right, while getting him
banned on a technicality, such as violation of
anti-spamming rules, is the politically correct
way to handle it.   Plus it gives the superficial
impression that you are trying to protect us
from unwanted spam.   :-)



  BTW, I am planning an on-topic followup to
that original posting, entitled "The Jews have
hijacked American chess."  In it, I will show
how players such as Reshevsky, Fischer, and
Gulko were really just ordinary strength
players made to LOOK like GMs through the
fixing of games.  The amazing part about this is
how Fischer later turned this around- convincing
many that it was everyone else BUT HIM whose
games were so fixed.    ;-)
