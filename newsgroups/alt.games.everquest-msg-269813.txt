Wish they'd designate some kind of rules for the RP server, but I know
they wouldn't be enforced. WoW at least has special rules listed for
their RP servers and at least makes a token attempt to enforce them
when violations are reported.

Seriously, if you don't want to RP and you don't even like RP, why the
fuck to people create characters on the server that's marked as RP
preferred? *eyeroll* I will admit, I encounter fewer l33t twerps on
AB, but I still run across people who aren't just making no attempt to
RP, but acting as ANTI-RP as they can... ( d00dspeak, mocking RPers,
names like "Ilikepie", so forth )
