Just in case that was a heavily veiled cut at me, I haven't farmed anything
in my life other than archaeologist packs from permafrost for my friends
(What?  I can't help it if a goblin threw a mammoth hide cloak and runed
circlet at me twice), and godforsaken tailoring supplies.  I WAS going to
farm the FRSS and fishgill necksashes for a bit for me and my friends, but I
got out there about 8 hours too late to get either one of them even once.

Well, unless you consider quadding wyverns for exp and getting a metric
buttload of armor gems to be farming, in which case guilty as charged.

Most of my money was earned by buying stuff cheap and selling high.  Or else
vendor diving.
