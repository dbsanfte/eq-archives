If I was you, I would NOT use /quit desktop
That just forces a LD, your at desktop but your character is STILL
active on server as you didn't properly camp out.

You can only use a parameter modifier with /camp not /quit

EQ just sees the /quit desktop ad just /quit

Its ok to use /quit if your at a spot, say in in a city somewhere, and
no npc's in city are KoS to you.


But if you not in a safe spot and you use /quit desktop, if a mob
should attack you a sec or so after that.. you could wind up logging
back in and find yourself dead.
