That's probably the easiest place to find a pickup group, yes.

>Curious, are agnostic human warriors KoS in dreadlands? 

The zone is inhabited by the likes of drolvargs, drachnids, 
mountain giants, brutes, and cockatrices, which KoS pretty much
everyone. Invis only helps some; most (all?) drolvargs and giants 
see invis, as do some drachnids. Fortunately the visibility
is good so avoiding hostile mobs isn't too hard. Drachnids
will root you so be especially wary of them.

>And how do i get to the dreadlands?

Druid/wizard teleports in zone (albeit a long run from usual 
hunting areas), or ride the boat to Firiona Vie. Dreadlands 
is adjacent to Firiona Vie.

Firiona Vie outpost.
