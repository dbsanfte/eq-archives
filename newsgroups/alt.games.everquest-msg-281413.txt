We did fine just the other night with me playing a shrouded enchanter
to get through DoD spell progression.  People are using rogues to pick
locks and CR.  Rogues, and I assume Berzerkers, will "work" as DPS
classes if you have 3 clerics.  I think the main roles the shrouds are
lacking in are tanking and healing.  The "cleric" is a poor substitute
for a druid main healer and the tank is, well, just plain gimp.  The
level 70 war couldn't tank much past tier 2 PoP zones.  They are useful
in the right situations.
