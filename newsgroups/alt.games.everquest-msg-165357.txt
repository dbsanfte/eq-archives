The money is the price you pay Verant. Your time is yours to do with
as you choose, and thus doesn't qualify as "payment". They gain
NOTHING from you spending more time in the game, and in fact lose more
instead. Thus, the customer that the gain the same amount of income
from but costs them less money to "support" is more desirable to them.

This "I pay my time too" is nothing more than a feeble attempt to
dodge the point.
