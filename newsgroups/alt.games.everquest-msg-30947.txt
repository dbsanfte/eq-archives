Whatever. One person's amusment is another person's boredom.
What other explantion can there be for things like golf, fishing and Pro Wrestling.
I mean somebody must like those thing right?

Ummm, why bother doing anything in the game? All you are doing
is changing the numbers and graphics on a screen. Ultimately
all we are doing is just pushing around some electons and magnetic
signatures.

Having the best uber loot in the game means exactly the same
as getting an orc pawn pick: Exactly zero.

Well then its time to move on to another game then.

The only question to answer is: Is he or anyone else that plays the

having fun then its time to move on and stop whining.
