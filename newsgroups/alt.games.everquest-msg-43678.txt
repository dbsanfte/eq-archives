If it's like me, it took over a month to get mine working properly, and
anyone else i have talked to almost that has AT&T's @home service has
been the same way.  They upgraded the main lines in most cases but not
the lines to peoples homes.  They came out replaced the line that went
from my house to the pole, and bingo everything worked.  Before that I
couldn't connect to the internet at all.  Appointments for onsite tech
support are very difficult to get here in the Detroit area, I would
imagine because there are many more requests for help than people to
respond to them.  Michigan was one of the test markets for Cable
internet access so, not suprising that they have a large subscriber
base.   I seem to be fortunate and only share my area with about three
others, so no big drop off for me.
