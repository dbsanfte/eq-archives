Read the review it sounds like anything but Diablo, and from a company with
a good programming record and good customer service.  Verant has reason to
be afraid, and its present stance of restricting access to numbers will not
help improve customer loyalty.  What they need to do is use the year they
have before this comes out to improve the things they are weak in and not
antagonize their player base any further.  Basically, WOW sounds like EQ
done right with much higher graphics quality than SOL will come near
offering.
