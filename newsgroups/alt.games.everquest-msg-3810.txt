All you who have played EverQuest some time now i would like to
know what is the best weapon type for Warrior 2HSlashing or
1HSlashing whit Shield or what?

And another question goes like this What are the most important
Attributes to Warrior? Strenght? Agility? Stamina?

Bash, Taunt? What they do? Are they useful for soloing?
Is Kick useful at all? What skills should i develope when i start
playing as a Warrior?

I hope you all can share your experiences whit me?
