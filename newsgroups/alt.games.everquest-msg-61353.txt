How long did you play with the DX8 dll? Are you a playing a caster? Do you
switch resolutions often (i.e. caster looking at spellbook)?

I am curious because I have a very similar system, Win2k, AMD XP1600+,
Geforce 3, 512Mb DDR and I experienced a pretty severe memory leak with the
DX8 dll. I was grouped in Kael for about 2 hours, going to the spell book,
switching res from 1600x1200 to 640x480, every 5-15 minutes to mem up
different buffs. The mode switching times started to slow dramatically after
a while, and I also experienced some lag with cursor movement and trying to
point my character in the right direction (I am a "mouse driver").

I heard Windows warning tones while playing and when I logged off EQ, I saw
the Win2k pop-ups saying I was low on virtual memory. With 512Mb of RAM and
a 512MB page file, this should not happen. EQ was the only user app running.

I am wondering if anyone else has seen this with DX8? This has never occured
with DX7, before or since.
