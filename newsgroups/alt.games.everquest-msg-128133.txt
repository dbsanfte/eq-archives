    When an item is bought from a merchant, it gets a new "internal item
tracking ID", for lack of a better word. So the piece of information a GM
uses to follow an item from character to character ends as soon as an item
is vendored. I'd suspected as much, based on how you can "recharge" charged
items on a vendor, but it wasn't fun how I had my suspicions confirmed.

    As for posting, *shrug*. It's a problem, and at least some exploiters
already knew how to take advantage of it. Can be stopped cold by raising the
buyback price from a vendor on certain high-end items (like anything off a
Velious king, the Avatar of War, from NToV etc.) to stupidly high amounts
like 200 K pp. But let me give you some idea how seriously this is taken by
our top guilds: a few days ago the other big guild on our server killed AoW.
They DESTROYED the legs that dropped because none of their monks needed
them, and they wanted to make sure all AoW legs were "known and accounted
for" on the server. If even one pair goes into general circulation, then any
time a pair is stolen jerkoffs like this guy can claim "oh, those are the
ones" - and the trade logs will be indecisive on the issue.

    When he was talking to my guildmate over AIM, he hacked into my
guildmate's hard drive. My guildmate even noticed it at the time, and told
him "please don't delete my MP3s, I like them a lot". =/ Yes, my guildmate
now knows a lot more about AIM security than he did before. Guildmate had
his passwords listed on his system. He changed his account password ASAP,
but never thought about his EZBoard password - until the site got very
publically altered.

    I agree. I don't account share for this reason, and for others reasons
as well (I HATE sending a tell to someone, only to find out they're not who
they should be). But no matter how many times I explain that account sharing
is the true root of the problem, people still do it. /sigh.

    I've often wondered how bad it is getting a Belt once you have the
Dain's head. Ack - that really stinks.

    Huzzah! Now you must really be a solo machine, what with the extra HPs,
regen, and ATK. =)
