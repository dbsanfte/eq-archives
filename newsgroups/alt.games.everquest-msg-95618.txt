If the fire would sit back and cast, it would be an excellent pet,
except for that whole thing where it dispells.  No good if you've
got someone slowing.

Epic is L49 (always, no range), max dam 67 (A focused greater Vocerate
is max 62), 3k hp, huge DS.  It uses the air pet model and uses
a stun as well as a nuke.  One of the problems with it is the 5min
recast on the orb of mastery.  

Monster summoning pets are great, as they don't cast spells.  Straight
melee.  However, there is only a limited span of time in which they
are useful.  the 34 (MSI) is very usefull to 38. The 50 (MSII) has the
same level range as the 49 pets.  And the 60 (MSIII) has the same range
as the greater vocerate pets.  If I ever make it to Arch mage, and 
assume I don't have my epic, MSIII will be my pet of choice, for the
no casting part.

When I was 35, my ranger buddy was 40.  With a shaman's help (39?)
we were taking the IG's outside of perma.  While I was waiting for
them, I resummoned until I got an IG pet.  At one point in the fighting,
the ranger had to back out, and my pet IG tanked that thing (which had
10 levels on it) for 30-40 seconds before taking a header.
