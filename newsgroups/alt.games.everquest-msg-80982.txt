Replace everything that has a lower AC than banded with banded.

Get a pair of jagged bands - you'll get good XP in Unrest now and may even
get some for free from someone camping the ghost. If not expect to pay about
30pp each.

New earrings, orc fangs for 40-50pp each or Gold topaz from  a jeweller
for 50pp the pair.

Crested spaulders for the shoulders from Mistmoore, if you're feeling brave
and have groupmates. Otherwise you may need to buy it, you could probably
take the caitiff with a group but he'll be in a very scary area y ou'll have
to invis to.

In order, the things you're interested in are:

Haste, AC, Hp/Sta, Wis/Mana, Dex

Once you're rich and higher level regen fits in there somewhere too.

Your weapons are "ok" for now; especially given you're untwinked. Sell the
stuff you were given, if you can, and look to upgrade to something with
a nicer ratio. A cheap two hander might be a nice toy to obtain - runic
carvers are pretty low now and may be better bang-for-buck, although I've
not sat down and worked it out.
