Talking about low to mid level zones - I think the new luclin teleports will
change where people hunt quite considerably.

The teleports from the nexus make the warrens and stonebrunt amongst the
easiest zones in the world to get to. Greater faydark, lesser faydark and
the zones around there are now much easier than they were for most people.

Compared with these zones kunark, vellious, zones around freeport, qeynos
and kaladim are now amongst the more difficult to get to.

Now fighting in warrens and going back to faydark to bank is practical as
long as you time your teleport correctly.
