If you've read my posts, you'll know that I do not have a Cleric - all of
what I know is from watching a Cleric friend, and the research I've done on
their spells. You can only be good with your character if you have a working
knowledge of the classes around you. (Which is why I always tried to have
real Clerics correct me - you can only learn that way.)

As for your comment, logs can be easily misrepresented and altered in order
to convey a point, or bring about a nerf. I seem to remember logs where
people claimed Clerics were out-damaging Rogues and Monks... yet people
believed them without really investigating it. That's my point about people
only reading the bottom line.
