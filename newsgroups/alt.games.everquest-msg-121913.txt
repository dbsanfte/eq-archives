I know that Microsoft was using the "by opening" tactic back when MS-DOS 6
was being distributed. I don't know if they still use it or if anyone else
was/is using it, though.

Usually I agree that EULAs don't carry much weight, but in the case of EQ,
they make sure that you are aware that the conditions exist before you
purchase the product and even allow you to find out what those conditions
are before you make the purchase. Other products are like a car dealer
telling you that you'll find out the conditions of the loan after you have
finished all the paper work and can use the car's key to open the glove box.
