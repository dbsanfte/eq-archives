I recall reading somewhere that the vodoo drivers conflict with nvidia, but
you should still be getting a signal from the card.
I just went and bought 2 Gforce2 MX400 PCI's for my wife and I pc we both
had voodoo 2000's and everything is fine.
try reseatint the card or switching pci slots and make sure its using irq11
and not sharing it
