Two thoughts come to mind. First, that you were charmed and not feared. 
Once you are charmed, if the NPC has the ability to heal, they will heal 
you since you are their loyal and loving pet.

Second possibility. Was the mob dispelling you? If you had HP buffs on 
and they got dispelled, or possibly even a dot/curse on you that lowered 
your total maximum HP, then it would appear like you were gaining health 
on the HP bar.
