Rogue Leveling Guide for The Burning Crusade (60-70)
Rogue Leveling Guide for The Burning Crusade (60-70)
This guide is an early Burning Crusade leveling guide.
http://www.topowerlevel.com/class.asp?sec=World-of-Warcraft-USAIn
other words, it is written for those who level in Burning Crusade
within a few months of its launch. I will update it to be a guide not
specific to launch and it will go into version 3.0 of my general rogue
guide. This guide is also intended for rogues. However, most of this
guide applies to all classes.http://www.topowerlevel.com/level.asp?
game=World-of-Warcraft-EUR&huilv=1&code=USD I'm not an expert at the
alliance aspect of BC but I have written this guide to be class
agnostic.As for my qualifications, I was in closed beta and took a
rogue and a mage to 60 there. I almost got another to 60 in open beta,
which was really just a short stress test. In retail pre-BC, I took 5
characters to 60 including a rogue of course. I'm the Guildmaster and
raid leader of The Unholy Legion on Kalecgos (transferred from
Tichondrius). We had more than half of Nax completed prior to the
launch of Burning Crusade. I was in the alpha and beta test of The
Burning Crusade and took my rogue to 70 and leveled some of my other
toons to about 65.This is not a walkthrough.http://
www.topowerlevel.com/dai.asp I'm not going to micromanage your path to
70. I'm just going to provide you with a lot of information and you
can decide what paths to take
