Yeah, but boilerplate EULAs aren't based on enforcability as much as
ROI. No one is going to hire a lawyer to get a US$40 refund.
Similarly, you'd be hard-pressed to find a lawyer willing to take on a
class-action suit where the maximum per person is US$40 and the
effected base probably less than 10k people. 

I suspect that Verant will *not* patch EQ to be compatible with
DirectX 8.0a or less than 256 MB of RAM. The number of customers they
will lose by pricing the game and its prerequisites out of range has
got to be less than the number they would lose if they failed to
innovate at all.

I watched a lot of people, particularly uberguild people. leave EQ
over the last few months in search of new horizons. A fair number are
back to play SoL.
