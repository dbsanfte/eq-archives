This story has been corrected today, it is now that the people that were removed
from the plane, was because they were matching bags with id.  As for people
arrested, I think only one is actually arrested and it was because he was acting
out, after being questioned about his id.  There was someone who had a fake
pilots liscence in his sock, but they don't think any of these people were
related to a continuation of the hijakings.  Hope that sets your mind at ease
slightly.
