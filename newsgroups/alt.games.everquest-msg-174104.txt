 In gaming groups, people tend to cut loose and relax. And even 
there, that dosen't always happen. In the Doom groups, I hardly see
see anyone use the terms  or type in the giberrish style that
you are talking about.

 People like this actualy tend to be flamed, or not talen seriously in
the gaming newsgroups.

 Feminism is responsible for a lot of the shit that goes on in
schools, including the drugging of boys on Ritalin, but I doubt  even
they caused kids 700 741|< 1][|<3 7|5. (translation: Talk like this :>

 While feminists probaly didn't cause the "script kiddie" and elite
"d00d/d00d37735" to come to be, they have helped to cause the
high divorce rate, and single "family" home (where the father 
pays out huge sums of child support under threat of jail, and
the mother often keeping the father from seeing his kids,
when he has every right to) "phenomenon" that is all
to prevalent in America.
