I'm going to demonstrate that I'm a NeWb here... :^)

Are certain monsters, which might /con the same color to me,
worth varying amounts of XP?

Basically, if two mobs con yellow to me, can I expect equal
XP for killing either one, or could one be worth much less XP
despite still being equally challenging to kill?

I'm a 16th level hafling druid and I'm heading into Lake of Ill
Omen soon, and frankly, looking at the bestiary pages has me
scared!  If I'm going to take this risk, I want to concentrate
on the mobs that reward me with decent XP for putting my little
butt on the line!  Of course, if you think that going to LoIO is
stupid for level 16, please do say so...

Thanks for the help,
Mike
