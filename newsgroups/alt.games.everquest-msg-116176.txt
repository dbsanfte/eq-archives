Well just to enter the fray. Big oil always posts a profit because of the
wacko enviromentalists. The greens have sucessfully blocked the building of
new refineries for decades now under the guise of stopping poluters. They
have also managed to get certain standards for gasoline in place and each
such standard is diffrent for each seperate place. It is to the point now
where by law there are hundreds of flavors of gasoline and each can only be
used in one specific place. No new refinieries ,constant retooling costs,
and population growth have produced an industry with low supply.

Insiders dislike gates and microsoft for one reason only. The whole windows
operating system is complete garbage. Right now xp runs badly using over 100
megs of ram. If we started over and built from scratch with good programmers
we would get an operating system that ran well in 1 meg. The fact that
microsoft regularly engages in practices designed to run any and all
competitors out of the market is irrelevant.
