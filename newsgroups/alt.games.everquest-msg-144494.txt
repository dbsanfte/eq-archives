LOL!  Wow.  My newsreader must be ignoring you, I never even saw your 
reply.  It's a conspiracy, Martin.  The aliens have us.  They'll soon 
have you, too.

So it IS just what I explained it as.  Which you snipped, btw :D

Well, seeing as it's what I thought it was, not sure.  On Emarr and 
TMarr, at least, only term I've heard is warrior port.  Although I 
really don't see how they manage it.  Bank = full of tradeskill items, 
me = full of bags full of junk, possible quest items, and yes, more 
tradeskill items :D

True.  Although in both cases a killfile works well.  Too bad serverwide 
KFs don't work.  I'm getting mighty tired of the asshole in 
serverwide.necro whose only contribution to the conversation is an 
occasional "::mounts <name>::" or "::poos on <name>::".  Oh, and today 
he moved on to personal insults.  How fun.

Look, I TOLD you the ogre already hired me.  You're just going to have 
to wait for me to make another character.

Of course, Tea already promised to PL me if I made an enchie on FV, so 
you'll be bidding against her... :)
