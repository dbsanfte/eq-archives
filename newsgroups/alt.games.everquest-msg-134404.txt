XP is more stable than Win98SE overall, but it is not as "game"
friendly. If you play a lot of older games, your best bet is to search
the web or google to see if people have any problems running them
under XP. EQ has a lot of problems with SBLive! soundcards when
running under Win2K/XP. Keep that in mind when you make your decision.

The choice is yours. You cannot go wrong with either brand.

>3.Ram: 512mb of 1066 rdram(if i go with xp maybe 1 gig,not sure)

Read some reviews before you commit to 1066. The current crop of
chipsets are not showing a significant performance advantage, unless
you are doing some serious overclocking.

Check the reviews and benchmarks at: www.anandtech.com
Then read through the Motherboard and CPU forums at:
forums.anandtech.com

You will find plenty of threads covering the different MBs and
chipsets for the P4. Not all integrated sound is bad. NForce equiped
motherboards (Nvidia's MB chipset for AMD CPUs) sport 6-channel
digital audio that is better than a SBLive! while at the same time
using less CPU cylces.

>5.Video card:Geforce 4 4600(128mb)  or new Ati 9700(128) any help here too.I
>know nvidia drivers have been better than ati in the past.

I doubt we will see the 9700 until September or October. It might not
be available if you are planning on building anytime soon. Unless you
want maximum performance you could save a lot of money getting a
Ti4200 or Ti4400. Check the reviews at the site mentioned above. I
personally do NOT feel that the 4600 is worth the additional cost. It
just isn't that much faster.

>6.Sound card:Sound blaster gamer(cant remember the correct name)

If you decide to go with XP, avod the SBLive! and Audigy if you can.
Look for a Philips Acousic Edge or Turtle Beach Santa Cruz. None of
the high-end soundcards work perfectly in EQ under 2K/XP, but the
creative ones are by far the worst.

>7.Hard drive: Western digital special edition drive with 8mb cache(100 or
>120 gig)

Nice :-)

>8.Dvd drive:I think one of the combo Dvd/cdrw drives(plextor maybe)

Do you REALLY watch DVDs on your PC, or do you just think it would be
cool? I have only used my DVD 2-3 times. It is much more comfortable
to sit in my living room and use my home theater system.

>9.Nic card: Are they all the same?(i currently have a 3com)

3com is fine as long as it is PCI.
