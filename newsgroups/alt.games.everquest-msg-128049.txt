Dan gave the best bard site with his reply.

Twisting isn't all that hard to describe though, here's a primer:

With few exceptions, bard songs take 3 seconds to cast and
last for 15 seconds each.  While it is possible to sing one and
keep singing it constantly, it will have no more effect to do so
than if you stop singing it the second you get it going and don't sing
it again till it is about to stop.

Why do that?  Well, because if you stop singing one song you
can start singing another.  Then you stop that one and sing the
first again, then the second, then the first.  Each literally has full
effect just as if you were singing only the one song full time... so
you are having -twice- the song effectiveness.

But wait, 3 seconds, 15 second duration?  Clearly you can run
a third song, then first, second, third... still having all three up
all thee time.  Triple the effectiveness this way.

Its possible to squeeze a fourth song in with good reflexes
and connection, reputedly even a fifth if everything is perfect,
but if any of those songs are critical (say keeping a runner snared
or keeping resists up to the maximum) its better to stay with three
which is long term sustainable with no skips.

There are songs that work only when sung, there are interesting
tricks you can do with some songs where you don't want to
twist, there are songs that don't stack, there are songs that require
various instruments.. but those topics don't belong in a basic
overview of twisting.

If you are a third level bard even then you can do the most
basic twist.  Chant of Battle, Chords of Dissonance, Jig
of Vigor, repeat.  This will keep up your str, dex, AC, do
additional damage to all mobs near you (stay away from
guards!) and keep your stamina up.  OK, its not the most
useful of combinations, but the point is you should see
the effect of all three songs running at the same time.
