Ride the boat from FP. Hope off on Sister island (the first and only stop
on the way) The boat from BB doesn't come close enough for you to get
there.

Once on the dock, you can see three islands. On the dock facing the ocean,
directly ahead is not the island you want. (Can't remember the compass
bearing right now). Stand on the dock, face the ocean, and turn slightly
to your right until you're lined up with the right hand corner of the dock
edge. You'll be facing the island you want. (Big gray granite looking
thing with lots of dead trees)

Better still: http://www.eqatlas.com/

Cyclops isle is close by, and although I've never seen it myself, I've
been told they can sometimes wander over to gargoyle island, so watch
yourself and keep gate memmed constantly. There's no where to run to if
the fit hits the shan. It's gate or die.
