This is what damage shields are good for. The non-engaged mobs hit the tank,
get hit back because of the damshield and become more aggroed. This only
works well after a few rounds of combat, so healing too soon is still a bad
move, but in general I'm having a lot of success with the damshielding.

But for the mobs-on-healer there is usually another class to help. The
back-up tanks like the ranger and bard, and if a war present the paladins
and sk's are great as well, are excellent at getting a mob of the healer.
Although these are sticky situations at best, the main tank doesn't have to
interrupt his damage output and can focus on the first target so it dies
fast.
