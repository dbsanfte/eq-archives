Nexus
C3
50 plat
Greater heal is suddenly good.

You only have a small bit until superior anyway.

Its because it rapidly becomes not very good experience. Its more for
messing around in for a druid around your level. I think I hung out
there until 52 or so.

I duo with my 40 cleric dark elf and just 39 sk troll. I run each of
them through the nexus getting c3 for 50 plat, then they go off
to butcher and do den and friends and tagnis, which are like never
camped (still blue for both of them for now) C3 lasts like 2 and a
half hours, which is more for than I play usually at one sitting. The
50 plat is easy to make back on "money" mobs like that. With both of
them having c3, my downtime is like nil.

The sk alone was doing great with c3 and I finally bit the bullet and
got another account and set it up with expansions through pop for 64
bucks, xferred my cleric over to it complete with gear (same server)

I wished I had done this like two years ago. Two boxing is just a
blast. Course its far better now with POP port system and c3 for
donation.
