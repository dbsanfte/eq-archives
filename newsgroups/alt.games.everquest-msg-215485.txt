So I'm doing my semi-regular run through the bazaar and searching for
some focus items, cuz my gear is seriously weak, when I find some ring
priced at 50p.

Don't recognize the name of the effect, so I head to the bank, and
bring it up again after I get some plat...NO RENT?  Wtf?  When did
mages start selling summoned items off their traders in the bazaar (I
have asked ones I group with for the odd item before)  Is this
practice common, or is it limited to my server?  And what do youj
think about it?
