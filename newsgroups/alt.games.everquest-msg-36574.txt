I find that odd, because the two skeleton guards in the Paineel newbie
ground are hard-coded not to move. The only way to aggro them is to get
within melee range, or attack them then get within melee range.

They con even to a level 10, but they hit like level 50's, are immune to all
magic, and a few million hps. We had a lvl 55 warrior attack one using his
Critical Hit discipline, and it didn't even put a mark on the thing's HPs.
All he had to do to stop the fight was back out of melee range.
