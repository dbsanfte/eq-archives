This might just be purely coincidental, but I restarted patch (for the 100th
time) and imediately went to task manager->processes and set the priority
for everquest.exe to HIGH.

So far, it's still patching and hasn't failed on a single file (this is a
first)

Hope this helps all those other frustrated users.
