Hi all,  I've just downloaded the Everquest trial version from
Fileplanet.  I've got it installed OK, it's up and running, i've
created a character and now i'm at the point where the camera spins
around your character.  I've clicked on "Enter World" to enter the
Mines of Gloomingdeep to start the tutorial, but it keeps saying "Zone
unavailable" then "your personalized tutorial zone is still loading,
try again in a few seconds".  I've been waiting for half an hour and it
still reports that the zone is still loading.  Is this right?  Does the
zone *really* take that long to load?  I'm using a 2.2mbps connection
so i thought it might be a bit quicker than that.

Any help would be appreciated.
