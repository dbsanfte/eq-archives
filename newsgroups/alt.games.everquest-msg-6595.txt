I've been playing a druid for a couple of days, and now that he's at 21, 
I've discovered the joy that is charming animals. I've gotten pretty good 
at killing the mob with my pet having just enough life left for me to 
kill it when charm breaks for more experience. My question is, which of 
the /pet commands will a charmed animal follow? I've gotten the list of 
commands from alakazam, but didn't have a chance to try any because of 
the patch. Are they just like a Mage's pet, or are there restrictions?
Thank you for your answers in advance...

when they've done it!"
