I think it does still work in PvP areas on Blue servers, but I might be
wrong.

On the "Zek" servers, it was deactivated a couple years back. Essentially,
what Fear does is make the PC an NPC and place it under the server's control
for the duration of the spell. Because of that change in character status,
it makes the feared PC vulnerable to attack by anyone of any level. So, what
was happening on the Zeks(where there are level limits on PvP) was that an
innocent looking Cleric, Enchanter or Necro would cast Fear on someone, and
then that player's level 50+ friends would come out of hiding, immediately
disintegrate the feared player and loot him, having used the spell effect to
negate established level limits for PvP. Not fun.

They disabled Charm at the same time, because Enchanters were developing a
nasty habit of charming someone and then gating right after they sent their
target off to fight a Griffon or a guard. There aren't too many Enchanters
on the Zek servers anymore.;)
