Congrats, man.  I was feeling for you when I read your original post.  I
actually ran my lvl 19 ( at the time, now 20.8 ) warrior through SK,
yesterday, to get the Abandoned Orc Shovel.  I'd never been in SK or Lake
Rathe.  Someone was on the same camp you were on, though.  I passed by where
he is supposed to spawn ( going my the map ) and there was a guy, very red
to me, sitting.  Waiting.

My wife and your wife should get together sometime and compare stories.  On
my first Pyzjn camp, I started on Monday and got the first GBS on Friday
night ( actually Sat morning ).  That was playing 3-4 hours a night, I
think.  TheWife(tm) would be working on her computer and ask me "Seen that
gal, yet?"  "Yup."  "Good job, honey!"  "Nope, she didn't have it."  "Does
she ever have that thing?"   "Not so far."

Finally got it, went to bed, and got up on Saturday, and got on EQ again.
Started camping her again after handing the GBS off to a guildie.  TheWife
comes in and says: "You're in the ruins again, honey."  "Yup."  "I thought
you were finished."  "Yup."  "Why are you there again?"  "I want another
one."  She came to the conclusion that I was a Pyzjn Camp Addict along with
an EQ addict.

She was right =)  And, within 3 hours or so, #2 dropped, so I guess it paid
off.

I can't wait for when I -have- to camp an item for a quest I want to
complete.  At least then I'll feel like I have a sense of purpose, instead
of just trying to get money.  Getting all my crafted armor will probably be
my first test of this sort.
