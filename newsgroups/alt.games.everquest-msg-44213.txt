If you have a friend/relative/casual aquaintance in the US you could
borrow your local friend's CD and use it to install the Velious zones
and display enhancements, then have someone in the US buy the
expansion and phone/email you with the account key number.  As a bonus
your remote friend will get a nifty box with a picture of Fironia and
maybe even a map.
