Wtf.  I read some of the articles on this and a lot of people seem to think
this is
"Logical", because if your account got hacked/stolen you were stupid/made a
stupid mistake.  Well, then Logic dictates you're stupid if you are still
playing this game.  

Don't get pissed think about it hoss.

Extreme case-
With enough time and a simple random generator, everyone is at risk.  You cant
escape this one, unless you constantly change your password.

Another extreme case-
Have you ever logged into Sony's EQ page?  
[What if ] Someone breaks the page decrypts the log info and then you have a
list of today's screen names and passwords.

Not so extreme case-
You go to College? In a dorm? Think that T1 line is a blessing? Well congrats
you are fu*ked.  With little time your computer can be hacked if you're on the
network.

1 more folks-
Are you using DSL? (maybe even cable) Nice and fast, huh.  Connected to the
Internet all the time you say?  Thats great. see above.  You got people who can
go through your computer steal your account and then even print a document
thanking you. Then print it out on your printer.


In conclusion, computer + internet = vulnerable. [only when 1>0] 
Even if you're not stupid and acting "logically".

Verant, congrats.  Spank your victims.  It's ok because they will keep shilling
out those crisp $10's. We apparently all know who's in charge.
