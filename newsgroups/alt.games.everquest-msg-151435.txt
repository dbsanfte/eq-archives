It would be great if someone could write good hunting guides which took into
account the level and the class. For example, the skeleton hut in LOIO is
great for paladins; they can solo it from about 25-30, but I'm not aware of
any other area that they can solo.

 Druids do very well in the karanas; it's wolf friendly, the griffons can be
feared and the giants outrun, and wolform is safe, so that almost all levels
to about 35 can do fine there, but on the other hand, many areas of luclin
are KOS to wolfform and full of creatures immune to movement changes that
move at sow speed and even the guards will attack you if wolfed; so as a
druid i never solo there... indeed, i see little of luclin that is solo
friendly for any class, with the possible exception of Katta's graveyard at
high level for the anti undead types.
