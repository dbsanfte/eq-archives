Druid - damage shield, heals, some bufs = best for caster class that can
nuke each one on the pull or AOE. Skills still go up. Upside is maxed
defense

Shaman - bufs, slow, heals, haste = best for melee since the melee does the
damage skills go up - if shaman has JBB can nuke em down after 50% for free.
Downside is not maxed defense because slow is keeping you from being hit as
often.
