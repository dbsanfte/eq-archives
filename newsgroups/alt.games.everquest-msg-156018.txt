Well, they supposedly did something to Taunt, have heard no report as
to whether it's made a noticeable difference.  And besides that, we've
had Warriors posting here that improving Taunt at the top end could
easily result in trivializing encounters, so I can't see them making
any big change there.

Well, if Taunt is ineffective at the high end (easily RP justifiable,
would the Avatar of War really give a damn what some puny little mortal
is shouting at/about him while he's busy smushing some Enchanter who
dared to cast on him?), but there're alternatives available at said
high end... what would the problem be?  /shield might turn out to be
a great way to improve Warrior "stackability" while giving Warriors
a way to protect their companions as they ought to be able to.

Well, yeah, sort of (take a moment to consider a stereotypical "dex
Ranger" /shield'ing somebody vs. a large raid target, heh).  But...
Warriors need something Warrior-ish that's unique and raid usable
for two reasons:  (1) their former boasting was actually not nearly
as irritating as their current whining, and (2) because once they've
thrown the Warriors a bone maybe they'll manage to come up with ways
to fix the other "non-stacking" classes.  I've had a Paladin main
since a few months after initial release (over 3 years now), and
after years of playing a gimped class (thankfully gimped no more) I
don't think anybody ought to be left stuck on the margin like that.
Sure having a couple Warriors along is great, but as many have pointed
out they just don't stack well beyond that, compared to "real" damage

dealers.  So /shield looks great to me as a Warrior-only toy.  Now they

need to make sure that every class has a way to "stack" effectively for
both large (multi-group) and small (single-group) encounters.
