    I went to the local Megamart, and to my dismay while they did have a
baking section, they did not carry alum.  Oh sure, they had plenty of
imitation butter flavor extract, which sounds pretty nasty to my ears, but
no alum.  Well crap.

    Hmmm... When you say "the server", um, do you mean an Everquest
server?  Or am I missing something obvious?  I seem to remember reading
something about this in my old alt.tasteless days.  And, it just might fill
the bill if does work as advertised.  I could stir some into the mashed
potatoes.   With luck, it will slightly affect the flavor, just enough for
the perp to think "Hmm, that's a bit odd...", then a few minutes later
they're in the bathroom with very troublesome physical symptoms (I had to
rewrite that last sentence.  Reverted to my old alt.tasteless ways there
for a sec).  So, with luck they will think they are poisoned, get all the
unpleasantness they so richly deserve, and still not be really, in a
serious way anyways, physically harmed.  And part of me really, really
wants to place a plastic wrapped note under the potatoes that reads "Dear
Food Thief, First it will start with rumble in the tummy..."

   So.  Does this *really* work?  And is it *really* safe.  Please, keep in
mind that to me this is not an intellectual exercise.  I am really going to
do something, possibly this.  And I really don't want to kill anyone,
regardless of the favor to the world that might be.
