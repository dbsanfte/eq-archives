Biggest problem is being posted to c.s.i.p.g.rpg as well as here. Generally
if it's one of Bob's posts I read it. Whether I'm playing or not he's
usually good reading. IMO he and Richard Lawson are the two most worthwhile
"reads" in AGE. Not to say I don't enjoy the vast number of AGE posters
(Annie, James and Bizbee (for pure entertainment)) would be in the top 10.
LOL starting to sound like an Oscar speech.

On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will
reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that
you will be able to climb higher tomorrow.
--Friedrich Nietzsche
