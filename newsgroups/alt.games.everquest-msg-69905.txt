Excellent summary. From all the information we've gathered in our group,
those seem to be the facts. However, some machines (e.g. my wife's
Gateway) seem to be doing just fine with 384 MB RAM if the other stuff
is up to snuff. But yes, the 64 MB Video card seems to be a must, and
the Intels are *definitely* handling SoL better than any other type of
processor for reasons unknown to me.
