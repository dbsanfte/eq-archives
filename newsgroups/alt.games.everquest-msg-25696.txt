Since you seem to be misrepresenting  what I said so blatantly and then
have the balls to suggest that reading my post would support your lies,
here is the quoted text from my post which you seem to have translated
into your own private language:

"The manual has been posted several times before.  If you are in
possession of the information you are posting because you are or were a
guide then hopefully you have (not) provided (any) information which
will allow VI to trace this posting back to you such as same email
address, IP address etc.  If you have given them a method of determining
who you are I would anticipate your account being rightfully terminated
as posting this information is something you have agreed not to do."

While YOU mention copyright and EULA, I do not.  I only state that if
you are an ex guide or current guide who came into possession of that
data because of your involvement in the program, then posting that
information violates your agreement not to do so and as such your
account should be terminated.  The agreement in question here would be
the NDA if you are unable to figure that out yet.

No, this would further support my assertion that I am morally outraged
that an individual would agree to not disclose information and then
renege on that agreement.  Just because you seem so easily confused by
simple language, do not assume that you can just as easily confuse
others.  Your attempts at tossing red herring about will do you no good
as I am a long time student of piscine aerodynamics  in a
gravitationally influenced environment, though I do admit to
specializing it terminal velocity calculations. (nods to old f.eq folks
who know what I mean <G>)

OK, at this point I can't tell  if you are being intentionally obtuse or
if you are just ignorant.  Those who would use the information for
purposes of rules lawyering have no experience of any value to ruin, its
the rest of us who suffer as guides first are overwhelmed by idiots
quoting chapter and verse from the manual and then quit in frustration
leaving the rest of us to try to figure out how to get that body back
from under the world.

I fear that most things in your mind are dead.  Loneliness the likely
cause of death.

I can only guess that this text means something to you.  To me it means
that you are not a very good writer because your message is entirely
lost, if even you knew what you were trying to say, if in fact you were
doing more than posting words for the onanistic pleasure of seeing them.

Just as a future reference, you have made it clear that you are an
egotistical moron incapable of public discourse due to either a failure
to grasp the English language or intentional illogic.  Continue to post
as you will, I shall mock you accordingly.  That includes making
references to the importance of your RL or the lack of mine you silly
silly boy.
