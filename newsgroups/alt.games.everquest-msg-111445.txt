I'm not a Druid, so there's a possibility I'm wrong on this, but the reason
Druids can use scimitars is because it's a primitive and simple sword. All
other swords require intense training (Doesn't a scimitar need training,
too?) which would take away time from their prayers.

Once again, it contradicts their own beliefs, but doesn't it hold a real
life similarity to priests in our world? :b
