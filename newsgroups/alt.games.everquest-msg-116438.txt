Are you talking "spell did not take hold" or actually resisted? The
first message results when a level spell that would normally
over-write the spell you're trying to cast is already on the target
(Either a higher level character cast the same spell/spell line or
something like trying to cast SOW on someone who's snared).

As for resisted, there's nothing you can do that will give you a
better chance of not being resisted against the same mob aside from
resistance debuff spells (Such as the enchanter Tash line of spells).
Charisma does zilch for resist rates, that's nothing more than a
superstition that has been disproven many times by people running
extensive comparisons.
