My thought on this:

People believe that a newsgroup is a tangible society.  Where an actual
message can have some effect on the person it's intended for.  I believe the
newsgroup is a collection of thoughts not a society.   If someone doesn't
like my thoughts, oh well no skin off of my back.  hell,, I shouldn't even
be replying to your post.  ohh well, I'll get flame for that too.
