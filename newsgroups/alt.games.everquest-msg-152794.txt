Something like this happened with our last attempt with Vindi (after
the lastest patch).  At first the chain was fine, the MT got heals.
But then, even though clerics called heals and saw their heals land
just fine, the tank did not get the heal messages and in fact died
since for him none landed.  It ended in a total raid wipeout.  We were
advised to try and overheal but too much dps left at that point so we
didn't attempt again.
