That seems to be the only factor. A druid friend of mine hunts there as
well. She is level 55. (Yes, apparently you still get some xp then.) If
I pull one of a pair of wyverns sitting near each other, I get them
both. (So I just root one and run the other one past the first's 'oh,
fuck it' range.)  However, at 55, she goes right up into the tower and
nails one and it will follow her down alone.

It's just level pulling, from what I can see. We are both indifferent to
CoV.
