lol, those free webspace users must rename pics to .txt and link them as 
if they were pictures. If you try to source a pic file hosted on 
Geocities or Angelfire (how about Tripod?) you'll get their placeholder 
image if you link graphics from outside their domain. Easily got around 
by renaming them to .txt, though less than impressive.
