In addition to all the EULA dreck, anyone that sells a 50+ character to
someone that has never played that class is, in the words immortalized on
this board, giving a loaded Uzi to a chimp.  Ebay clerics don't know when to
heal, Ebay casters don't know when to nuke, and I swear that Ebay warriors
have had their "taunt" button amputated.  If there's no foolproof way to
keep them out, at LEAST label them so those of us that have learned this
stuff at level 10 don't get killed by them...
