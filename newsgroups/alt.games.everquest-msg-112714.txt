    My guild sent him a big "congrats" when he got it. It was fun watching
all the other wizards on the server work to get him AoE groups so he
wouldn't die quadding or doing something even crazier (like when he was
soloing the Bear Pits in Permafrost at one point). And he did get a Graffe's
title out of it!
