Worn haste and spell haste will stack up to the cap of 100%, so 71%.

100%.

Haste v2 (Bard Ervaj line) will stack with item haste and spell haste but
will not break cap, so the 5% from Melody of Ervaj will up your haste to
76% in the first case but do nothing in the second.

Haste v3 (Bard Rizlona line) will stack with item haste and spell haste,
allowing you to break the cap. So adding Rizlona's Call of Flame with its
30% haste v3 will bring you to 101% in the first case and 130% in the
second case.
