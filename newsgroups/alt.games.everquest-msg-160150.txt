I found this as well. Soloing in mid-high 30s (as a cleric), root
would be resisted 50% of the time and would break very
quickly, with several different kind of MOBs until I gave up.
Wrath was also partially/fully resisted, not as often as root
but often enough that soloing was not an effective option. I would
get the MOB to about 60-70% HP using about 50% of my mana,
whereas with most blue MOBs the MOB would be very nearly
dead by then.

I haven't seen resists as consistently even in DL as I was
seeing in OT. Don't know why, but it's true.

(Although in DL I've mostly been grouped, not solo.)
