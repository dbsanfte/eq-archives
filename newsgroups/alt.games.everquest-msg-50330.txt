It is VERY WIDELY believed that if you kill the Buccaneer very soon after it
respawns then it has no impact on the next respawn, but if you kill it later
(perhaps 10 minutes after it respawns) there is a strong chance that the
next respawn is skipped altogether. Some people go so far as to recommend
killing the Buc immediately just in case someone wanders by 30 minutes later
and kills it for you. I left it well alone and just shouted at anyone who
came near ;)

I camped 12 hours straight to get mine :(
