Isn't Pet Hold pretty much useless now? Since pets no longer
attack mezzed mobs? I can't think of a good use for this
ability.

What I would like is a Pet Attack Exclusive command.
Pet attacks what I tell it to attack, to the exclusion of
all else.

I can't tell you the times I have lost battles or died
because my pet is attacking some stupid easy mob
that whacked it once and the Uber mob I really want
it to attack is nuking me to a cinder or pounding my
skull into my knee cap.
