}Well I killfile people rarely but if it pushes your buttons enough do

}my point of view.  

I'm in category (b).  And somewhat (a), I really haven't bothered to 
use my killfile in about 4 years.  I'm sure I could remember how, but I 
fail to see the point.

Saying 'if you don't like it, killfile it' puts a burden on the reader to 
take action.  Topposting is an issue best solved by the poster.

}That was my point .. this NG is the only one that I
}visit that verbally abuses people for top posting .. I repeat the only
}one. A solution for those that get on their high horses about this is
}to killfile people, makes sense really.

People get verbally abused for a lot of things around here.  I would 
highly recommend getting over it and developing a thicker skin, or not 
playing here if you can't take it.  You're kind of amusing, really.

"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Well, don't stick your finger in there..."
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Have you considered, maybe, not sticking your finger in there?"
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Have you tried putting thick gloves on first?"
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Hel-looo... it's called a 'learning curve'..."
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Please yourself then."
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"
"Ow! I stuck my finger in there, and someone bit it!"

People will be flamed.  People who whine about being flamed, will be 
flamed more.  People who whine about other people being flamed, will also 
probably be flamed.  Invest in fire-retardant underwear.

}> The thread under discussion, the 'bottom poster being caned' thread,

}> can move on to that later.  But given it's a thread -you- started,

}Two threads ... the first started here:
}http://tinyurl.com/28f5x
}that was what I was referring to and the start of all this nonsense,
}The second was the "bottom poster getting caned thread" which when I
}posted it quite clearly illustrated my point that the NG in question
}was a top posting group and were in fact attacking a bottom poster.

Aye, and I'm quite clearly referring to the second thread mentioned here.  
Events in the first thread are not relevant to the thrust of my argument.  
I am, of course, aware of the first thread, and did in fact read it, 
since, as I said, I don't use a killfile.  But the point is, you thought 
it would be totally brilliant to go and start -yet- -antoher- thread about 
topposting and the innocence thereof, while taunting DT and Ben into the 
deal, and then had your ass handed to you.  And now you've moved on to 
whine about how unfair it was of them to hand your ass to you like that, 
and how you won that argument (in clear defiance of the obvious evidence, 
IMO), and derail a welcome-to-the-newsgroup thread into a flamewar about 
whether or not people should be flamed when they do something stupid.  It 
really doesn't matter whether or not they should be flamed.  THEY WILL BE.  
Sure as the sun rises.

But here's the funny thing.  Let's look at that other thread you're so 
anxious to revisit.  The link you gave doesn't point to your first post in 
the thread, now, does it?  But rather to a post almost two days later, 
after the flamewar has built up steam.  Your actual first post in the 
thread would be here: http://tinyurl.com/292rm .  This is interesting.  
Very interesting, indeed!  It seems that a fellow named "Hal" topposted.  
This prompted longtime a.g.e poster Lance Berg to follow-up with "A) 
Please don't top post in the AGE newsgroup".  This is the -rudeness- you 
chose to flame Lance for?  And it must be Lance, since he's the -only- one 
who said -anything- about Hal's top posting.  Oh my goodness!  How 
rude!  He said "Please!"  My ears can't stand the sound of such a foul, 
cussed word!  Why do I suddenly hear Ben's voice in my ear, saying, 
"@ndrew lies AGAIN!"

}> Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.  Bravo.  You can add a gold
}> star to your reading chart now.
}Sarcasm does not become you.

Sarcasm -is- me, already.  No becoming needed.

}> This is the same as, if End Times
}> Prophet were to return, and more than 50% of the posts in a.g.e were
}> suddenly useless bullshit, that would not make a.g.e a newsgroup
}> specifically intended for the dissemination of useless bullshit.
}> Similarly, a top poster, particularly with a dander infection,
}> posting a huge number of top posts to a group where 70% of the
}> posters prefer bottom posting, in no way makes that a top posting
}> newsgroup.
}Of course it makes the group a top posting group .. the majority of
}posts seen by people are top posts.  Occasionally I visit other groups
}for interest, if I saw 60% of the posts are top posts I would think
}this was a top posting group.

You would think.  But you'd be wrong.  If I came to a newsgroup, and saw 
60% top posts, but -all- the top posts were from the same 2-3 people, 
while 90 other people posted one bottompost each saying "please don't top 
post stupid shit like that", I would rapidly arrive at a very different 
conclusion.  Namely, that this poor bottomposting newsgroup was being 
overrun by 2-3 schmucks who are probably in half the people's killfile by 
now.

}But in the end you have fallen for the
}three card Sisson, Bizbee, DarkTyger trick where you believe the
}posting was about whether my list of NGs was top or bottom posting.

Your list of newsgroups was data, that proved not to prove what you 
claimed it proved, by your own admission, even.  That, ultimately, had 
nothing to do with anything Ben, DT, or bizbee might have said about it.

}It wasn't, and is shown quite clearly in the url I gave above.  It was
}about the question ... why is this the only newsgroup I inhabit that
}roundly abuses top posters.

You mean, like we totally thrashed Hal?  And how we ignored Arquvan's top 
posting for at least 16 threads before I got bored of looking?

Generally, it is only top posters who attempt to righteously justify their 
top posting that get roundly thrashed about the head and shoulders with a 
blunt object.  Those that say 'oops' may suffer a fate as horrible as 
hearing the word 'please'.

}People can post all they want about whether the groups are top posting
}or not (it is spurious) .. the simple fact remains that no one in those
}groups verbally abuses posters for top posting.  In fact, I have not
}seen verbal abuse in any of those groups unlike this one thanks to
}Sisson, Bizbee and DarkTyger.

I'm led to wonder how many of those other groups are in the alt hierarchy.  
'alt', loosely translated, means 'unmoderated'.  That means verbal abuse 
is likely here, as there is no mechanism in place for enforcing against 
it.  It has nothing to do with top posting, particularly, though.  We'll 
verbally abuse you for spamming, lying, quoting out of context, hey, 
whatever comes to mind.  There are moderated alt groups, but this is not 
one.  And it probably won't ever be one.  You could try to start a 
moderated group, and moderate it all by yourself, and keep bizbee, DT, and 
Ben from ever, ever posting anything hurtful or mean there.  But that is 
not this group.  We would probably feel, on average, that this impinged 
on the freedom of speech you suggested earlier that we did not value.

}>}> Yes, you did defend top posters.

}>}killfile them do not abuse them.
}> This is cute.  Translation: "I do not remember defending top posters, 
}> I do remeber saying things that might easily be interpreted as a 
}> defense of top posters."  Troll score: 1.7. 
}A defence of top posters is to suggest that people killfile or
}ignore them .. are you serious? 

Yes.  You are directly suggesting that any ill effects of top posting are 
the reader's problem, and not the poster's.  Not to mention, "leave them 
alone" is clearly a defensive statement.  And so is "do not abuse them".
