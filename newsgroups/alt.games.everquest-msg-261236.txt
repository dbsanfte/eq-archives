Subject: Well in SolA?

I don't know my way around here SolA very well but I've been in a few times and
have never seen a well anywhere.  I'm on a task that asking me to go to the
room with the well in it.  Checked EQ atlas map and unless I missed it I don't
see anything that resembles a well.  Anyone know where it might be?
