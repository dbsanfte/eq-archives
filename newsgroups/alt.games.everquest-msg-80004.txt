> So pet tanking with me BoD-pacting him ? I haev notbeen in the Hole
> yet.

yes pet tanking and u healing him. u staying just on the verge of non-agro
so that you outdamage pet.

i pulled with cancel majic, sic pet ( where did the verb sic come from), lvl
29 darkness, our heal over time spell on the pet (forget name), bod, lvl 34
nuke (the skelly nuke is resisted a lot here)

49 pet only btw, 53 gets 0wned =/

i tried the fast poison dot we have (is it envenomed bolt) but you have to
wait for a good 10 secs to cast or else you will take agro.

u go in and theres a ledge. closest to the water there is an upstand beam
that runs along the ledge.

          __

like this in section. stand on the upstand to do your casting and pulling.
or else u get the "you cannot see your target" rubbish.

either kill all 6, once every 3 mins. or kill all 6 as quick as possible and
then go for the crusaders and roamer.
i would recommend leaving the crusaders and roamer alone unless u can handle
getting whacked and rooting / mezzing really hard-hitting fast-running
mobs-it could all go wrong fast.

try and get a group tho cos then u can get the crusaders and golems that
drop loam. mind u, a few of the pieces they've dopped i can't seem to sell
for 100pp -choker and veil. did get nice legs and boots though.

at 54 xp is still 1 blue per hour. loot is about 4pp per mob if you include
the rare gems.

i would recommend deffo staying in the hole thro 52 and 53. and do your 6
points of AA there too. Once you get innate run speed, the crusaders might
be easy - dunno, doubt it =)?
