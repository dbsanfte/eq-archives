All true. It'll be pretty obvious if you're wearing a lot of gear
targeted for a lower level. Mages can get away with crappy gear and
several empty armor slots, but fighters certainly cannot. On the other
hand, most of my summoner's money goes to buying overpriced books.

I think EQ2 does have a pretty good balance between the usefulness of
the classes. It seems strange at first that fighters don't do more
damage, but damage-dealing isn't their primary function in this game.
Some mobs, if they turn on my weak mage will kill him in a few hits.
The fighters in the group can stand there and take it without a
problem. I get pretty pissed when this happens because it means the
fighter isn't doing his job.
