Speaking of gremlins...I've seen /tell text change in EQ.  A friend said
something to me in /tell, and it had some simple error, like "you" instead
of "your", or something similar, and I made fun of him.  He seemed confused,
and I explained I was making fun of his typo, and he said there wasn't a
typo.

He lived next door, so I ran over and checked on his screen.  Sure enough,
no typo.  He came back with me and checked my screen: typo.  The typo was
also in my logs, and not in his logs.

We tried the exact same tell again, and there was no problem.
