Your first question has absolutely no bearing on the issue.  Your second
question is a bit misleading, because people like Ted Kennedy and Hillary
Clintion claim to be christian, without providing any clues in their action
to support that claim.  Try reading transcrips of the hearings, or listening
to tapes of it.  The call into question his ablility to do his job due to
the fact that he is a christian.  This is when they're not trying to make
false charges of racial insensitivity stick.

Ah, another one who wants religion to be distilled down.  Guess what, it's
not that simple.  Do you think the Old Testament was replaced when Christ
came along???  Or is it just inconvienant for you to recognize that it is
quite possible for christianity and conservatism to coexist?

Well, since you're so much better, why don't you provide specific examples
of how conservative viewpoints clash with christianity.
