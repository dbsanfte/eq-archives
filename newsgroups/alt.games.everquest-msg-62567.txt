He's not joking.  Here's how you build a PC.

1. Open the case.

2. Place the motherboard inside, so that the ports on the back line up
with the holes in the back of the case.  You should see that there are
holes in the motherboard that are over matching posts on the case.
Put screws in them.

3. Put in the disk drive and CD drive.  This might be as simple as
sliding it into place and putting in some screws.  If it is a 3.5"
disk in a 5.25" bay, you'll have to screw a metal thingy to the disk
that makes it wider, *then* slide that assembly into place and screw
it in.  (Oops...left out a step...look at the jumpers on the back of
the disk and CD, and make sure they are set to MASTER).

4. Plug things in.  E.g., plug the power connectors in on the
motherboard.  Plug in the power connectors for the disk and CD.  Plug
an IDE cable into the first IDE connector on the motherboard and plug
the other end into the disk.  Plug another IDE cable into the second
IDE connector on the motherboard, and plug the other end into the CD.

5. Stick the RAM and CPU into the motherboard.  Put the CPU cooler on
the CPU and plug it into the connector on the motherboard.

6. Put in your video card.

7. Plug in your keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  Double check everything
(in particular, make sure you remembered the CPU cooler).  Turn on
power.

8. After you are happy that it seems to be working, you can turn it
off, and put your network and sound cards in, and then close the case.

Basically, everything in the PC falls into one of three categories:

1. Things that are screwed into the case.  The motherboard and power
supply are in this category (although usually the case comes with the
power supply already attached).

2. Things that are screwed into the drive bays.  Installing these
consists of mechanically mounting them, and then plugging in a power
connector and a data connector, and, in the case of CD/DVD drives,
also plugging in an audio cable between the drive and the sound card.

3. Things that go into the motherboard, such as expansion cards, RAM,
and the CPU.  Generally, you just plug these into the appropiate slot
or socket.

Take a look around at the web sites of motherboard manufacturers (such
as www.asus.com) and disk and CD drive manufacturers.  You should be
able to find PDF files of their manuals, which will tell how to
install, which will show how easy it is.
