Yeah, that's the problem, resists.  Once you get stuff mezzed it's not
so bad since mezz song knocks their MR down 35 also.  I haven't had to
switch in Occlusion yet, but I'm generally not doing crowd-control
against mobs that are that MR.  Once the mob breaks mezz, you retarget
them, sing it again, and thank Bristlebane that you're wearing plate.

With 3 mezzed mobs, yeah, you drop manasong.  With two, it doesn't
really make sense to.  You can move around enough that you can deal
with a resist or two before the critter is close enough to hit you.

It's a combination text message and just knowing the timing.  Most
songs will pulse about every 5 seconds and show a text message, but
almost everyone but bards filters bard songs.  The way charm is now,
it lasts about 18 seconds.  You can time it two ways.  The easiest and
most reliable is to sing charm until it takes, immediately switch to
another song, target mob and sic pet on it, watch until timing song
pulses for the third time, take a bit of a pause, then restart charm
song.  With timing it's pretty easy to get charm re-sticking within a
second of it breaking.  You can also sing charm and twist two other
songs twice each before you re-charm, but this isn't quite as exact.
If you've gotta do CC, pump mana, and haste the tank though, it works
out ok.

Nah, I'm just trying to be most effecient.  If the enchanter has his
snake (does everyone else name them silly names?  we have George and
Fred), then he can do it all pretty easily.  If not, they generally
ask me to take over some responsibility.

Nah, I never worry that I'm not doing damage.  I worry that I'm not
adding much to the group.  About the only time that I really do any
real damage is if there is an enchanter and a shaman, because at that
point I break out the drums and the DoTs.  I'm not a rogue, but it
does add about 220/tick, manafree, and lowers resists about 40.

Yeah, that's also why you often see mobs moving when they are close to
a wall or a ledge.  Nothing like having a mob fall off the battlements
in KC and bring back the both courtyards while trying to do a bit of
safe exp grinding.
