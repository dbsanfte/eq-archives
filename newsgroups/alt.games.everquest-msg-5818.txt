Yanno...I was truly expecting Avenger to come up with some weak copycat post
that all his little cronies could pat him on the head and tell him how funny
he is...but it looks as if Sword has taken the role of Brat's little parrot
this round...

I guess I'll just never understand the logic behind the "oh yeah...well
double doody on you" posts...I guess I could just cancel either this NG or
FAnG and still get the same results, because I'm really tired of reading the
same tripe twice.

No point really of dragging you guys through the mud in here though.
Considering the majority of you will be reduced to monosyllibic responses
now. I'd much rather embarrass you in front of a group of your own peers as
they tell you all the STFU and go away. It's always entertaining to watch
Avenger and crew parade around in their own home only to fall on their faces
and be laughed at by all of their closest friends.

So Princess...you still "stuck in dick mode?"
