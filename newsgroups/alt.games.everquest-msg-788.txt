I have a GeForce 2 and it works fine. It's an ASUS v-7100. Which is
good, because I bought it to replace a Creative Blaster Banshee
(Voodoo 2) that kept locking up my system whenever I played EQ. I just
could *not* get the 3dfx drivers to work with it. I tried everything I
could think of. Finally after two weeks of screwing around with it and
locking up every 10-20 minutes, I gave up and got another card.
