All but the last one sound a lot more like Root/dotting or rotting than
kiting.

While the recent changes to dot damage do make Crud a valid component of
kiting I have never heard of anyone using Pogonip for kiting (or prity
much anything else to be honest) and Root spells while good for escaping
from bad kites are not a component of good kites.

Generally snare + DD = kiting
Dot + root = root dotting (Dhu)
Mobs + Pogonip = CR (or green farming)
Root + DD = Broken root
and now with the new no loss of damage dot rule
Dot + snare + dd = ? Dot Kiting ?

Hope that helps,

Btw, I did not even spot the spelling since mine is so bad to start off
with.

Jim
