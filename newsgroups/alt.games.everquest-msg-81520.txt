For the first two members.   It is not a linear increase.    IIRC, with six
group members a mob is worth 120% of it's normal experience value.

Assuming the kill rate is the same is the key part of that sentence.  If you
add another person and the kill rate stays the same, tell them to stop going
afk for 20 minute streches. : P
