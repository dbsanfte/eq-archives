No, I'm ragging on this because you're charging well over $40/month
for a game while at the same time ragging on VI for charging just
that. I'm ragging on this because you're making so much money off
people who are willing to pay it while at the same time ragging on VI
for doing the same thing.

Do I need to pull out the good old dictionary and post the definition
of the word "hypocrite" for you? Somehow I don't think that would
help, though. You've obviously missed the point 3 times now.
