Thanks for the reply Jim, and thank you for all of the information -
and no I was not aware of a server merge as of yet, so I think I may
go back and check some things out as to how the dynamics of getting
into a group, and see what the actual differences are from the gaming
perspective. I just wanted to check the user perspective before making
the final leap into the game once more. A yearly expansion is not that
bad actually - when I left they were at two per year. So - once again
thanks for the info and I will have a look at Allah for more details.
My in-game name is Edyil so for Pete's sake if you see me in game -
invite me to a group :).

Thanks,
EG
