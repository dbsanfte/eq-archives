Well, my argument is I watched a GM warn a pickup raid on Naggy for having
the healers stay back in the safe room.  Granted, I think the GM was an
idiot and everybody ignored his warning anyway, but at least one GM at some
point in EQ history has indeed proclaimed standing around the corner from AE
an exploit.

If you're waiting for me to actually argue that anything is an exploit, you
haven't been party to my other posts on this subject.  There are *no*
exploits.  Sony has the code and programmers, they have the ability to
change the way anything acts and interacts, therefore if something "is" then
it "is" because it is supposed to "be".

But for argument's sake, check some past discussions and a patch message
archive for a trail of how DS stacking used to work and how it was changed.
