Im not necro, but my rogue did fine at 29 using engulfing darkness (dagger
proc) and instill doubt (fear).  So your standard fear kite should work
fine.  I dont think they require anything special.  Watch out for the shaman
(they like to slow and poison) and keep in mind the "furious" hit much
harder than their counterparts (same con) of the normal variety.  None of
them resisted the dagger procs (engulfing darkness) or the whip (choke)
procs.  Hope that helps.
