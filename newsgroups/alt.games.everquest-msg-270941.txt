In EQ2, this is slightly complicated: the AC/shield factor of an item
has full effect only against mobs of the same level as the shield or
lower (level of an item is basically the Mastery skill level divided
by 5), against higher level mobs the effect is reduced.  But with such
a large difference, I suspect you'll be better off with the lower
level shield for quite a few levels.
