Ooh, Lord Bob, AKA, Lord Alphabet, AKA Lord Dojo, AKA, Lord
Slapmyfaceonthekeyboard, real name, Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar  (I did that
off the top of my head too, check it for correctness  =P)

He's an ice efreet in Velks, he drops a lot of monk stuff, which leads to
his other alias of Lord Dropsalotofmonkcrap.

Personally, I dont quite get the idea of an ice efreet, considering that the
very definition of an efreeti includes fire, heat and things that generally
AREN'T cold.
