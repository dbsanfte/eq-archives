Except that they aren't.

Snow isn't frozen rain. Frozen rain is frozen rain...that is why snow is
not called frozen rain :)

Sure it is. Anyone can attack anyone else, except their realm mates. Think
of the realms as your friends. You don't try to kill your friends, even in
UO (unless you are bored, and even then they know it is coming). Only
difference between friendship and realmmates is that while you CAN attack
friends if you really want, killing realm mates is (more or less) hardcoded
out. I've played on several pvp muds where there were hardcoded
restrictions against attacking certain people (usually of X level and
below), but that did nothing to change the fact that those were PvP games.
