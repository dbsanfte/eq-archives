You might want to reconsider that.  While there's certainly room
to criticize some aspects of US foreign policy, Mandela's being
a major fuckhead on the topic when he calls the US "a threat
to world peace".

Frankly, it looks to me as if Mandela's trying to divert attention
from his own government failures -- South Africa is falling apart
in nearly every way imaginable.  And rather than admit that
his Marxist policies are to blame, Mandela would rather despise
the US for being such a clear example of the strength of capitalism,
and for being unafraid to make clear just how irrelevant and
impotent the UN has made itself.
