	If you go to their website, the very first bullet point on the feature
list is PvP combat. One of the first comments in the FAQ is "Unlike
traditional role-playing games in which a playerï¿½s greatest challenge is
fighting computer-controlled monsters, players in Camelot will come
face-to-face with their greatest challenge yet, other players." PvP is listed
as a major feature improved in DAoC  over UO/EQ, and PvP as the endgame is
also listed as an improvement over those games. The section on PvP in the FAQ
says things like "As the players grow in stature, they will be expected to
protect their realm from enemy incursions, as well as occasionally go on
raiding parties against other Realms.", "At higher levels, players will have
to adventure out into regions between the realms, which could bring them into
conflict with enemies, but not necessarily so. ", "The game will not force
players into PvP, but if you choose to do so, you will become more powerful"

	Aside from a communique from the Burning Bush, I don't know how much
clearer it can be made.  It's a PvP oriented game; believing otherwise is
self-delusion at best.
