Lure generates so much aggro that it's nearly useless for the damage
it generates--any wizard casting this too soon, dies.  Cast it too
late and it's meaningless.

No the main reason for wizards is Dragon's Bane and Giant's Bane.

Those two spells have ridiculously low aggro.  I'm not kidding when I
say 10 DB chain casted will generate less aggro than one 825hps lure.
That's 20khps of nuke which generates less aggro than a single 825hps
nuke.

I've had failed Yelinak raids where the last person to be summoned and
munched on was the wizard who had earlier chained about 12 to 14
dragon's bane.  When we win against Yelinak or ST warders, none of the
DB casting wizards die.  Even after dropping 10+ DB on the dragons.

Switch them around.
You want massive melee damage more.

>6. Monk (same as #5)

Nahh, given a choice between a monk and rogue, get the rogue.

>7. ShadowKnight

SKs and Monks are usually for chain FD pulling in places like ToV so
you can clear the junk and get to the named.
