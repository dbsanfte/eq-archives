There are a few players who offer that "service" for a fee. There was a bard
in Clan Werre (forget her name now) who used to run around advertising that
she had unlocked all the dungeons (max spending limit of 1440 at all
dungeons) and would purchase items for a 50ap fee. Don't know what kind of
takers she got on this offer.

For some reason I never completely understood, Guk was always the least
visited of the various dungeons. I unlocked both MM and EF early on and got
close on Tak, but I think had a total of 2 adventures in Guk.
