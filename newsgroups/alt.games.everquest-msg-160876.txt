People use abbreviations way to much in EQ.... ever asked for a camp check
in High Keep? You'll get responses like RR, WR, LR, and RR.... eeeeh.... :)

If you ask in general what zone would be best to hunt in at a certain level
you get all zones in abbreviations. How the hell should I know what LOIO is
hehe.... I figured it out by now but it is better to say the whole zone name
so I have decided to be less lazy :)
