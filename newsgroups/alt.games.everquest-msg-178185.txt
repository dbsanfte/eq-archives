Nope, you tried to put bogus words into the mouths of hundreds of
thousands of people, and I suggested an alternative that's far closer
to the typical attitude and contrasted the two.

No doubt.  Bitter people often cling to their misconceptions.
Especially bitter people who are trolling.

I disagree.  So do quite a lot of other people (you remember those
hundreds of thousands of subscribers?) including SOE themselves
(see the text of the Jan29 patch message elsewhere).

Troll?  ROFL.  If you want to see a troll go read your post.

LOL.  That takes the cake.  You try to put words into the mouths of
hundreds of thousands of people, and then when I point out words that
are much closer to what most people are saying you accuse me of
putting words into your mouth?  Here's a clue for you, troll boy:
You're the one trying to put words into other peoples mouths here.

> The troll will come off better.


Your troll is rather lame, it's tripped and fallen off the bridge,
and it doesn't look to know how to swim.

Well, it's hardly a shock to me that a bitter ex-EQer trolling a.g.e.
cannot recognize logic when it bites him in the nose.  Sorry, no
score for you this time Ed.  Zilch, nada, nothing.
