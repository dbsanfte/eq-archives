I've heard of it happening before, usually when you're encumbered.  I came
too close to dying in Shadowhaven the other day because people were in the
port-in spot and gnomes have a hard time extracting themselves from the
herd.

Sounds like the CS person was courteous enough and you got your rez, what're
you bitching about?  You should not have moved your corpse...I'm still
trying to figure out why you did.  You could have looted your corpse a
couple steps away.  You SHOULD NOT have moved your corpse.
