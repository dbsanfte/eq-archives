So true.  Just the other day someone came up to my Bard and wanted a sow.
"I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way."  I replied, expecting to give a nice
explaination after a query of maybe, oh "Why is that?" or something.
"WTF?  You got a @!$%% problem or something?  How hard is it to %T@#  sow
someone?"  or something to that effect was his answer, he was actually a
little nastier than that.
Screw it, I say to myself.  He's a total nimrod from what I can tell.
"Hey mana doesn't grow on trees, and spells aren't exactly free you know" I
say, slipping into complete tightwad mode.
He continues to argue with me, saying he's got a long run and I'm a %#(@@
for not helping him.  I offer to sow him for 20pp.
"WTF??  You sonuvabitch!  You want me to pay for sow?"
"Pay or walk.  It sounds like you really need it, and if you call me another
name it's going to be 30pp.  One more insult after that, no sow for joo!!!"
He hands me 20pp.  I invite him (for bard song) and he doesn't want to join.
I explain that with bard sow, you need to join group or it won't take
effect.  He calls me a bitch.
"20pp more or no sow" I say.
"That's 40pp for a sow? No way!" he says.
So I explain the extra 20pp is "walking-penis tax" and to some more
grumbling he hands it over and joins with me.
I fire up song with a drum and he runs around a bit (with me staying with
him for song effect).
"WOW!  This is that fastest sow I've ever seen!"  he says.
"Bards sow rocks!" I say.  Then he did just as I had expected (and hoped).
"So long, %$#%-sucking, *#(@@!!!!"  he says then disbands.
About 30 seconds later I get a /tell from this retard asking why it wore off
and sweetly asking for another sow.
I got another 20pp from him for another sow, he calls me names and disbands
again.

He supposedly reported me, but I put him on /ignore and never heard from it
again.

*sigh*
