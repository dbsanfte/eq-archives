Absolutely, and my response was supposed to be obviously tongue-in-cheek, 
but it's hard to wink via text.  I still think in a rez situation, 
especially in a hot LZ, you want the one person who is ready to work 
immediately.

You're right here, that is the biggest issue with a bard doing CC, with a 
single mob we're pretty much fine, with two mobs we can keep either haste 
or manasong up, with 3 mobs we're generally stuck doing CC only, and with 
4 mobs we're getting nervous.  Any more than 4 adds and it requires luck, 
log lag, great targetting, and more luck.  A bard with epic should be able 
to keep haste up pretty much full-time, as long as s/he's attacking at 
least every 3rd or 4th mob.  It takes work, but if the puller keeps the 
pulls to 3 or less I can keep 'em mezzed, keep manasong up, and be 
assisting the main tank.

A bard can't do CC in Juggs, they are all level 56 or higher, but then 
again an enchanter can't mez 'em either.  Enchanters have used dictate 
every time I've done Juggs, but we generally are rushing through Juggs on 
our way to get Trak dead and then do whatever was planned for the night.  
King is also tough, since the King is level 56.  I have seen one time when 
there were two Kings up at once, and I wouldn't have been able to do the 
CC there, without an off-tank.  Other than that, I've successfully broken 
and held King every time I've tried.

Yeah, that's the absolute worst, being the last one alive, with 3 mezzed 
mobs, and waiting for the cavelry to rush in.  I'm alwasy tempted to run 
for the zone, but I just get lost when I try it.

> Oh yeah.. chanters tash and slow are 2 other things.

Aye, bard slow sucks, generally.  That's why we love shaman.  Tash is 
nice, but OOS is a pretty nice debuff too, unresistable, and generates 
very little aggro.  Granted I generally don't have it up when doing CC, 
since I find the AE slow is better is getting the mobs looking my way so I 
can pick 'em out and mezz 'em easier, but I'll always load it on mobs with 
decent resists.

Actually, a good enchater is MUCH better at CC than a bard.  I'm not gonna 
try and debate that.  I generally defer to our guild enchanters on raids, 
though we have had Trak runs where I've been the CC until Juggs, just to 
show that it could be done.  (It's a lot tougher in a raid situation 
because targeting sucks, and it's easy to miss a robe in another group 
getting beat on.)  When I'm with my guild, which is 90% of my time now, I 
let the enchanters do CC if they're on.  When I'm in a pickup group 
though, I will talk to the enchanter and work out CC strategy.  
A bad enchanter will get you killed, immediately.  At least a bad bard 
generally gets the bard killed, and may give you time to get away.

 > if your a jack of all trades, don't expect to be a master of any

Bah!  I'm master of running away!  And CR, I've had a lot of practice at 
that.  Which brings us back to the original point.  A bard is better than 
an enchanter for the first one rezzed, because a bard with Catata puts out 
C2+ levels of mana, with nice regen to heal those with rez effects, from 
2 seconds after they pop up at corpse.  A bard groups with cleric, starts 
the song, and loots.  While looting, the song is going, giving nice regen 
and mana.  When looting is done (maybe 10 seconds), you have a 1100+AC 
mezzer there to deal with a wanderer or three.  If you have more than 3 
adds, you're probably rezzing in the wrong spot.

Arolpin
we don't need no steeenkeen chanters!
