Disconnects are a result of your PC not being synchronized with EQ servers.
Too much activity on your side, or a server problem on VI side can cause
this. If you have any background apps running (IM, Kazaa, VirusScan, etc.)
then disable them.

I have a similar set-up as you, but when my second PC (sharing bandwidth)
starts sharing files on kazaa I can watch my performance on my main PC
degrade to almost LD at times. Super great hardware + DSL/Cable helps, but
does not garauntee LD or disconnect issues.
