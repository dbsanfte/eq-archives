My system is a Pentium-200 MMX, 64MB SDRAM, Voodoo 3000, 56K modem (connect
at 24k where I live), this is below the recommended minimums for processor,
and connection speed.  Takes me 3 or 4 minutes to load after selecting a
character, takes 2 or 3 when zoning.  It kind of sucks, but I can live with
it until better connection options are available.  The times when I really
have problems are when I am near a lot of other players, mostly at city
gates, or in blackburrow, then response time really sucks.  I will be
upgrading the computer, but nothing I can do about the connection, unless I
want to pay way too much money a month for satelite, or Covad DSL.  I may
have mentioned this once or twice before in this ng, but Qwest sucks big
time.  (For those of you that don't know, Qwest is the local baby bell where
I am.)
