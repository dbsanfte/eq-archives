Unless, of course, the Dual wield class character is intelligent
enough to equip a 2-hander.  In which his damage will exceed the
Paladin by a minimum of 25% and likely significantly more.
Paladin/SK weapon and Offense skill caps are quite a bit lower
than other melees, we hit less often (much less often) for less
damage.

I cringe every time I see a non-Knight melee near my level doing
less damage than I do.  Hi 50s Rangers with 800ac dual wielding
9/22 weapons are just as unproductive as:  idiot Paladins who
haven't the first clue how to use their spells effectively, idiot
Necros who pull aggro off a chain-casting hybrid tank, idiot
Clerics who cannot cope with more than one health bar dropping at
a time, idiot SKs who think that the occasional 'tap is adequate
to hold aggro and never use their real +hate spells, & etc.
/rambleoff

In other words:  NO, a Knight with a WMBS is NOT a DPS class.
