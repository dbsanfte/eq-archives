In answer to an unspoken question, if you continuously hit that Mend button
as often as you remember, the skill starts to NOT suck around level 15
(about 50% success).   At 16 it's closer to 75%, and now at 18 it rarely
fails.   I hear by 20 failing is nearly unheard of (I would assume this has
the standard 5% minimum failure rate that everything else in the game seems
to have).

Just keep hitting that button!
