I finally got Castersrealm shaman spells to load; this pages freezes
up on me a lot while loading ads for some reason.

Castersrealm says yes, only way to get it is parchment to BL and
hope, or buy it in Bazaar

Apparantly these -do- stack with IOS though

1 hour 12 minutes, same as Tuna... well shorter than Tuna till I get
an extended enhancement III item.

OK, castersrealm says it -does- stack with Strength, Dexterity and
Stamina.

So:

HOS plus Stamina: 250 hp 67 str 50 dex 40 stamina, at the cost of two
buff slots and 525 mana
IOS, Tuna, Stamina, Strength, Dexterity: 250 hp, 117 str 105 dex 85
stamina for 5 buff slots and 750 mana

another possibility: IOS, Tuna, Stamina: 250 hp, 50 str 55 dex 85
stamina for 3 buff slots and 550 mana; thats 45 more stamina for one
extra buff slot and 25 mana cost, this would be the "max out HP and
screw the other stats" plan, which I'll probably end up using

Either way, this means I have to start looking for IOS, seems too
useful to ignore

Paax, 49 shaman looking for 61 spell, what is -with- this class and
its spells, anyway!
