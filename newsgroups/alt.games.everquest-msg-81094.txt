I was just there last night as a level 46 druid.  Everything on track was
green with the exception of a few red con "named" (so to speak) Ice Giants and
a  very few blue cons.  The perma crystals do drop off about any goblin I'd
guess.  I used to get them all the time when hunting there in my early 30s
getting a mammoth cloak and runed circlet.  They dropped off the gob
placeholders for the preacher and alchemist, so I imagine they must drop of
many types of gobs.

At 46, none of the goblins aggro'ed on me (except for a single goblin evoker
for some reason).
