I have a 46 mage - and no flames from me here, necros are, hands down,
vastly better solo'ers and can add more to a group.

The improved mod rod at 54ish allows you to get back more than you put
in, but for solo work - it's still a mana batter.  It's got 3 charges,
300hp for 225 mana.  If you also carry a stack of bandaids around (500hp
for a mage at max BW) you can modulate yourself to almost dead, bandaid
to half and use phantom armor (+5hp per tick regen) to get the rest back
while you med up.  For cases where you REALLY need the mana NOW, this is
very workable.  However - 54 is a long way away for me, much less a new
mage :)

A mage without his pet is a dead mage (mostly).  Also, unless you can
get T-boots or J-boots, you're forced to go out and fight where the mobs
roam, rather than pull to your pet (which necros can do early, as they 
get the snare like darkness)

Also, Verant admitted at Fan Faire that putting CoTH in was a
"mistake" and they have eliminated it's use in many of the high
level zones where it is the only thing mages bring to the party,
that others can't.

Mages pets are, level for level, better than necro pets for the essential
task of tanking the mob.  My 44 pets can stand toe to toe with mobs that
would eat the equivalent level Necro pet.  OTOH, BL pets are even better
tanks (from my limited experience with them).

If you're interested in a pet class, you might also give the Beastlord
a look.  Good solo, good in groups.  I'm having a blast with mine.
