I've been trying for like 5 minutes to log in.  WTF!  If I can't get in in
another 5 minutes I swear I am going to quit if they don't refund me my $.13
for the time I paid for.  It's not fair.

And NO!  YCHMS.  DEA.  (For those of you that are acronym challenged [is
that politically correct] You Can't Have My Stuff.  Don't Even Ask).

Oh, and one more thing....
Happy Patch Day
