   When I saw a thread with a title to this affect in the past, 
I thought to myself "Dumbass".  The last thing a cleric would
want is to generate agro for themselves, and time spent running
and pulling is time not spent medding.

    In most cases, where there is a fullish group, I still feel
this way.  But duoing with Lenny, we've recently discovered that
maybe my being the puller isn't that bad of a thing.  The reason,
of course, is the changes to the Lull spell line.  I remember
when it simply didn't work.  Cast it, get the whole camp, pretty
much guaranteed.  But as of late, it seems to be working as well
has harmony used to.  Oh, I know that it can fail, but so far,
for me, failures have been very rare, even when casting on
yellows.  Right now, Lenny and I are working the mutant camp in
Echo Caverns near the entrance to Shadowhaven.  I can pretty
reliably pull singles there.  Yes, I get hit a few times till
Lenny can taunt them off of me, but that's ok, my defense level
isn't quite maxed for level and I want to get beat on a bit
anyways.

   I dunno... my instincts tell me that being a cleric puller is
Bas Thing, but for a bad thing, it seems to be working pretty
well.
