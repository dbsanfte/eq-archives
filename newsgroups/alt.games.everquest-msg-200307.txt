Well, actually, as a BL you may be screwed at your level.  A pet class that 
can root the mobs would be in luck.  A rooted mob will not summon you, if 
your pet is in melee range.  I have to admit to not playing around with the 
wars there until level 61, so, I have no clue as to the difficulty of the 
mobs at much lower levels.  I had no trouble at all with them at that 
level.  Another possibility is bring along a partner that can root for you.
