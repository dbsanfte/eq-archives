Kaev does have a good point though, even though I'd never thought
about it. Doing NBG even in pickup groups does tend to get you noticed
and make friends. It's not all that hard to tell the difference
between the lootwhores and people who can actually use something that
drops and people tend to remember that. I've very rarely gotten burned
on NBG and those people tend to stick out. I just go out of my way not
to group with them again. Not getting a chance to roll on one item is
usually a small price to pay to find that out.

I've always gotten a bigger kick out of looting a piece of equipment
or spell than buying it in the bazaar so that tends to influence how
my groups do loot. 

I honestly don't recall the last time I was in a group that wasn't
NBG, except for a camp like the FT3 boots in CT where everyone goes
just to farm a specific item be it to wear or just for cash. Not sure
if all of Bristlebane is like that though, since I'm much more likely
to start a group than join one, my preferred loot rules usually apply
<g>.
