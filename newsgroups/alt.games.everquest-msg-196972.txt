Wow, 2 otherwise useless AA skills just became *VERY* useful :)

For those who didn't know, Servat of Ro is a little drake pet 
on a 9 minute reuse timer, he used to be green to a 61 and cast
a bolt spell - IOW, his bolts didn't often hit their target, and
were mostly resisted when they did.

For the elemental forms, they used to have a duration of 36 minutes
and a reuse timer of 72 minutes - meaning you could have them up
at most half the time - for 18aa points (to get a level 3 form) that
was just about rediculous.
