Mostly they're for "local flavor."

At one time while EQ was still in beta (long long time ago) they *might*
have had plans to eventually implement a purpose for those sled dogs beyond
mere decoration.  But if those plans ever existed, they (like the plans for
player housing and guilds halls for player guilds, etc.) have probably
fallen by the wayside.  Or the dogs may have been part of a quest that was
never developed.

We'll probably never know.
