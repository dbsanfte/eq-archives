I think that the current two party system is absolutley ridiculous.  We are
constantly having to choose between the Republicans who pander to a lot of
special groups to try and get their vote and the Democrats who pander to the
special groups since they are the only ones who support them.

We live in a society which closer resembles socialism than democracy.  

Bush is a poor economic and immigration President, but at least he will protect
our borders.  Iraq is a terrorist haven because they are fighting us THERE
instead of on out own soil.  Between the two to choose from, I choose to fight
it THERE!

Kerry is a complete goof.  He has campaigned for nearly 18 months and has yet
to take a stand on anything.  All he says is "I can do it better".  No
direction or ideas, just typical political BS.  

The problem is not that people of the same family are voted in, but people from
families with MONEY.   Bush II, Bush I, Clinton, Carter, Reagan, NIxon, etc.
etc. were all wealthy.  Not one of the a common man who can tell the poor to go
work instead of sucking off the government, which is what we really need.

Like it or not, BUSH wins this November.   Time will tell if it was the right
choice
