> 1. How long did the entire zone take to complete?

We were in the zone for probably two hours, but I can't say that we actually 
completed it. I'd say there were probably half a dozen big encounters 
(double up arrow yellows and named mobs) that we did not approach, probably 
another 30-40 regular mobs around the zone, and who knows how many quests we 
didn't discover. /shrug.

No, if you zone out you will not be able to get back inside for another try 
for another six hours or so. As I've said many times, I don't see EQ2 as 
being all that friendly to the casual player, contrary to what seems to be 
the consensus.

Sitting no longer has any effect in the game. A patch or two ago they took 
out the sitting benefit and it's now nothing more than an emote. Regen times 
are by default pretty fast and constant, downtime is absolutely minimal 
(unless you don't have food or drink in which case regen of HP and Power, 
respectively, slow down measurably). Regen is much slower also when you're 
in combat.
