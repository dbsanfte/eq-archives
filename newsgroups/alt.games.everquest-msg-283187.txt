You know - after the DX9 fiasco I simply stopped playing (since I
always cancelled billing after paying each month, I didn't need
to quit).  I never said "never again" (in fact, I stay current on
the news just to see if anything will draw me back) -- BUT -- EQ
and any other SOE product have to meet a much higher standard
in order for me to consider going back than any other games do for
me to consider starting.  

Vanguard would have to be the single best thing since sex for me 
to give SOE another shot.
