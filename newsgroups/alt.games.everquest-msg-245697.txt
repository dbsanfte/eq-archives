So?

Seriously though, its the only way to do it. A Level 1 adventurer with a 
full set of Time Armour doesn't make any sense either. So what if its 
even 'level restricted'... this guy doesn't have to go to the plane of 
time... he can level up in the equivalent of Paludual Caverns, ding, and 
put it on.

That is going to be decidedly unsatisfying to everyone.
