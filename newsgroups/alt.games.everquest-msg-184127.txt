Ok, I'm officially sick of the dreadlands. I spent a few hours there last
night and for the last hour I'd totally drained the place of dark blues...
was very annoying to have to kill cyans just to get some blues to spawn.
Made a yellow which is nice but it was just too annoying.

I'm looking for somewhere to get experience, probably by soloing, probably
fear kiting. I do not want to go to effing KC, as it blows goats.

Static spawns are fine, I need to practise my feign pulling anyway, an area
where fear kiting is difficult and dangerous is also fine I get bored if
it's too easy.

I've got all expansions except ykesha.

FYI I'm a 51 human SK.

Cheers,
James
