If you're going for the CSS put it in your primary, it has a better dam/del
than the lammy (just)

Erm, no...it's more important to put the lower delay weapon in your off
hand.
I don't expect to explain Dual Wield to a 52nd warrior but here we go
anyway.

Primary CSS delay 24 (2.4 secs)
Secondary Lamentation Delay 19 (1.9 secs)
Both work independantly of each other.

Example (this is ignoring Double Attack)

You press attack,
1.9 secs and your Secondary does a Dual wield skill test, lets say it's a
success
Secondary weapon swings (yes first, it has a lower delay)

2.4 secs Your primary swings

3.8 secs Your primary makes another skill test, another success, it swings
again.

4.8 secs your primary swings

5.7 secs Your secondary makes a DW skill test, lets say it fails

7.2 sec  Your primary swings

etc

Reasons for putting the higher damage weapon in your primary, it will ALWAYS
swing every time it's delay allows you will get a greater ratio of double
attacks on this + I believe (feel free to correct if you know otherwise)
that riposte will use the primary weapon, only.

Put the faster weapon in your offhand you will get more DW attempts and
therefore more successes (also if you carried the timing on you'd see that
you off hand would actually do 2 attacks in the time the primary takes to do
one)

I'd actually go for twin lammy's, myself. as they are so fast they are worth
a huge amount of taunt and the stats that are given by the CSS aren't all
that for a warrior but the Lamentation with 6strength and stamina on both is
pretty impressive.

My god, why aren't I wielding Lamentations? Oh yeah, I can't afford them :ï¿½)
