I think what he's getting at is that your total damage dealt counts
towards assigning the kill and looting rights, irrespective of whether
that damage was just enough to finish the mob off or massive overkill.

Say a mob has 50 hitpoints. Newb_00 has got it down 45 hitpoints so it
now has 5 hp left. Uberwiz_00 comes along and 'helps out' by using the
500pt DD he happens to have memmed. Uberwiz_00 gets the kill, because
although he only took the mobs last 5 hp, he did that with a 500 point
shot, so the engine decides he did 500 damage and Newb_00 did 45.
