But the potential for entertaining drama would be huge!  All the
people who believe that much <would> change would be engaging in
highly public hand-wringing and/or venting of pent-up frustration
when they discovered that the well organized guilds full of players
that spend a lot of time online were right back in their customary
"leading" positions (as far as content currently mastered) within
days.  For instance, how long do you think it'd take for the first
Vox/Naggy kills?  How long before the first raid-useful epics were
achieved?  If nothing else we'd quickly learn which epics are
truly the easiest for organized guilds to complete, any epic done
before the first couple click-sticks by the highest end guilds
would likely have to game out as almost trivial in comparison.
