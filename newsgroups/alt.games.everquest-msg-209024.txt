When did I say that? All I said was that each item had a certain base
buy price and sell price set for NPC vendors, each of which is
modified by charisma and faction. What the fuck does the fact that the
buy price and sell price on some items are farther apart than on
others have to do with it?

It wasn't? Either you need to learn to read or I'm hallucinating.
Since the strongest drug I've taken is Pepsi, I think the latter is
unlikely.

Here, James' EXACT FUCKING WORDS (Along with what he was replying to):

Now, what this suggested to me was that James was saying that the
buying price of an item was a range ("built-in min and max price" =
"price range") and that charisma and faction differences between
characters on the price merchants will buy an item for could be
bypassed by setting the min and max on that range to the same number.

I never said there wasn't a max or min effective charisma. The
charisma modifier simply has a cap on each end. You'll get a range of
prices based on charisma, and a certain min and max for the same item
from the same merchant, but that doesn't mean that those numbers are
hard-set values rather than just being the result of modifying a
single value by your charisma and faction modifiers.

Whatever I'm on, it's not nearly as strong as what you're on if it's
interfering that much with your reading comprehension.
