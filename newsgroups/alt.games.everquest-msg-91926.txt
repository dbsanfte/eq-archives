Verant is doing it on thier OWN messageboards.  You know, the ones they 
control and they pay for.  Their sandbox, their rules.  Smile or pound 
sand.  Usenet is a PUBLIC forum; Verant doesn't touch it.

Then you should probably know the most servers no longer respect cancels, 
and should be able to confirm that no cancel was sent for your original 
message.  On the off chance that there WAS a cancel sent, you should be 
able to find which IP address it came from pretty easily.  I'll give you a 
hint, news.freenet.de keeps articles for several months, and has complete 
coverage from what I've seen.  Why don't you run along and report back who 
cancelled your little posting.
Oh, and remember, shiny side out.
