To raise CoV faction, you're gonna want to hit the Kromzeks.  While
there are roaming Kromzeks who con green to a level 60, most of the
Kromzeks will be blue and summon (meaning level 51+).

When you get to the Arena area (almost all of the giants there are
going to be on the Kromzek faction--except Vindicator and his pets),
the mobs will almost always be 51+ and many will be 55+.

The arena area is basically for 2 or more groups to hunt.  While a
very strong group can hunt there, it's not recommended as the only
form of crowd control is root/park (tricky) or charm (better but can
potentially be Enchanter Death Touch).

Just avoid the area past the Protector of Zek spawns--that's the
roaming path of Derakor the Vindicator and his two pets.  Derakor
rampages and flurries for quad 700's.  Generally not something you
want to pull with just two groups.  :-)
