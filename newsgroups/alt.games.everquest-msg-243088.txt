As others here have stated, Necromancer or Shadowknight. The choice
depends on what you ultimately wish to accomplish with him/her. If you
are looking to whittle the time away solo as a fun alternative, go for
the Necro.

SKs can solo however, but ultimately shine in group settings. My 65 SK
can out tank most warriors (in my guild anyways) and actually is a
better tank in many circumstances because he can hold aggro better
than a warrior. The only time I wouldnt be a main assist is against
Raid Bosses - where a warrior's defensive skills far outshine SK's,
but under other circumstances, I often grab aggro from the other 65
warriors without even trying. One thing to note - the guild Im in is
far from high end, so Im sure elemental geared+ warriors would present
a different situation.
