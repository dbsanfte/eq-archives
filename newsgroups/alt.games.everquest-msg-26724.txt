It's a great name.  Tigole is a Halfling Rogue who worships
Bristlebane.  "Bitties" is a name that would fit right in with
traditional Halfling last names.  Having some wordplay in the full
name fits right in with Bristlebane...it's just the kind of name a
Bristlebane-worshiping father would name his son.
