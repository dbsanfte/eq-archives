For those interested, thanks.  My network connection is very simple. I have
two computers connected to a Linksys Router and the cable modem connected to
that.  As far as I can see in the software there is no firewall set up.  My
cable company (Comcast) has now gone with non-static (dynamic?) IP's instead
of the old assigned static address.  It could be a combination of Comcasts
recent switch to a new network and VI's latest patch or two.

    What frustrates me with the tech support answer is that is really isn't
an answer. It doesn't explain what is wrong.  I sent them every bit of info
they asked for and they couldn't say, "This is what's wrong" just "We don't
support networks/cable/dsl modems".  They seem to be absolving themselves of
any problem on their end without telling me what the problem is.

    Has anyone else having this problem heard from tech support with a good
answer to the problem?
