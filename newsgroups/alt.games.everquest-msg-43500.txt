Antlered Mask.  AC7 and some minor melee stats.
Cheap as dirt.  Some jackhole tried to convince folks that the one he
was selling ran 8k per pop, I loaded the four I had on level 5 gobbie

Tattered Mantle,
Any dragonbone stuff from Western Wastes.
Imbued Granite Spaulders.
All are good, especially the latter if you can wear them...uber
resists.
