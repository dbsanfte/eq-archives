What he is talking about grouping with higher levels that are faction
hunting.  He supplies the random buff/dmg spell and gets exp from the kills.
He does not get wasted exp.  It is still split normally, the high level just
does not get any for the kill if it was a green mob.  At 40, you can group
with 60s and get exp.  Shaman seem to have an easier time getting to do this
due to their buffs/heals.  Just don't count on anyone other than a friend
grouping with you.  I've seen this a couple of times in Droga (high levels
killing greens for VS faction).  Skills for the low level char will not keep
up, though.
