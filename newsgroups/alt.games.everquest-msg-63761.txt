We all know of Verant's stellar record when it comes to new releases.
The loot tables are insane, with uber items dropping like rusty weapons
off newbie orcs. Low level mobs are given dragon-like spells. Quests
that end in 'Thanks, I guess'. And, my favorite, emergency patches at
the most inopportune moments.

Because of all this, I hereby announce:

Rune's Guess the Showstopper Contest!

All entries must be received before the servers come back up to be
eligible for the grand prize: Instant fame and recognition as the
Nostradamus of the Newsgroup! OK, I guess that doesn't really give
you guys much time, but it can't really be fair if I set the deadline
to the end of the month or something, can it?

You may submit as many times as you want, since there's no real prize
to be had (I'm too cheap!). Winners will be selected using my patented
and amazing laff-o-meter. In other words, make 'em funny!

In the event of a draw, the finalists will battle it out in a duel to
the death in the Arena. No, not the zone, in a fully-popped Kael Arena!

My employees and relatives are barred from the contest, however, since
I'm neither, I'll kick off with this:

Rune's entry to the super-neat Guess the Showstopper Contest:

One of the Spire-to-Luclin ports will take you to the Hole, right on
top of Master Yael. This will only happen if you're NOT in a group
to maximize the fun!

Rune
Eh, screw the time limit, just submit some fun entries!
