Please tell me episode 1 isn't there, and that Jar Jar has died a slow painful
death before the next movie.  Hated the kid, hated Jar jar didn't care much for
the Nascar imitation of the pod race.  The underwater scenes were breathtaking
but the rest of the movie did nothing for me.  since Young indiana jones was on
TV here in the States, Lucas has been dumbing down his scripts and making them
more and more for young kids, and to hell with the rest of his audience.  The
reason the Original Star Wars, and Empire strikes back were so good was they
appealed to a wide audience, and not just young kids.  Jedi wasn't over the top
with the Kiddie stuff, but even it started to wear thin with the Ewoks.

Not to mention the Japanese animation, Kimba the White Lion.  I mean that was
the same story plot basically, but better written.  Disney even encouraged the
Law suit initially as free advertising.

James and the Giant Peach is same style of animation as Nightmare before
Christmas and while not directed by tim burton, it did have some of the other
talents behind Nightmare before christmas returning.

Ghost in the shell and Baoh are both anime.  Baoh at least also was released as
a manga in the us by Viz comics.
