The person to put on the job is someone who is used to being the pull 
group healer.  Being one such, when I am in the pull group, I always ask, 
or wait for a request to heal before I heal, regardless of the status of 
the healthbars.  Pullers die, it happens, better than the whole raid 
wiping.  We do almost always use a shaman as the pull group healer, as 
shaman seem to be the least likely of the priest classes to have that 
heal when the bar goes down instinct...

Bards make excellent kiters under some situations, as they don't need to 
stop in order to play an agro song, and they can run damned fast, which, 
for some mobs, means they are the only ones who can run fast enough.
