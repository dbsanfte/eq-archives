I'm a half elf ;) 

Humans look amazing.

Stats wise - assuming thats what you're asking - tunare wood
elf. They get nice starting wisdom, you can plunk all your points
in sta, they get ALL the nice quest and culutural stuff.

Otherwise, choose who'll make you happiest. Wood elf rangers are
ten a penny. Humans and Half elves are much more unique ;)
