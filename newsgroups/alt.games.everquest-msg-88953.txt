<sigh> I know, but I hate to do that.  I see no reason, outside the armor
quests to go whack poor fairies.  Sometimes I really think Verant tries
their hardest to mess with roleplayers.  That's why I was hoping someone had
some spare dusts sitting around, the deed's already been done, nothing you
can do about it now.

At least the Brownies don't walk around down that way very much.

No, -that- I didn't know.  Thanks for the info, since I almost certainly
would have tried to turn them all in at once.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
