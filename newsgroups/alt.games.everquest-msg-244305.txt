The only time the new UI is great is if you know the name of the item, 
*and* you are making several of them. Now in that situation... you 
probably already know what the ingrediants are... otherwise you aren't 
going to be making 'several of them'. So in that situation you wouldn't 
need to ref eq traders anyways.

I suppose now and then you need to make a single X and can look up the 
components in game... but eqtraders does a much better job of it. Where 
to get them, sub combines,... key info is readily available.

And finally i ref eqtraders primarily for questions of: i have an X what 
the heck is it for? The ingame system is useless for that.
