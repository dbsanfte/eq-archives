Ok, heres the deal.  If you are on PvP server, not nearly so bad.  get
up you resistance to poison, disease and fire.  If you are on a
non-pvp server, give up EVERYTHING to focus on disease and magic.

The reason for this is that the lifetaps are actually disease based
spells and the fear is magic based.  If you get feared, even one time,
you have lost unless you are a very lucky ranger.

When my necro duels someone, here's his routine:
(assuming I'm playing fair...)
Fear
Screaming terror (to stop you from running away)
Darkness line
pet
poison
re-apply fear (although I don't usually have to do this, I like to
irritate you when you die without having been able to touch me)

When he can't fear, he shadowsteps away, lifetaps, then gates to a
bind spot in the zone.  comes back, lifetaps, gates.  I've tapped
warriors as well as wizards to death this way and I assume a ranger
will be much easier.

Good luck, and don't worry about the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

(oh, by the way, if a necro's DOT kills you, you DO loose experience
so you might want to think about that)
