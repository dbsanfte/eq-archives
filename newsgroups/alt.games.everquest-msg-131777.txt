Well I can't find my notes on this, original was on a now defunct
guild board so I can't get it  that way either.  Here's how I
remember it:

Random systems don't reward people for showing up to
raids where no loot drops that they can use.

Points systems don't reward people for showing up at
all unless they are near the top of the point pyramid... casual
players, recent guild recruits, and invited guests (even if
of needed classes) are out of the running entirely

So why not combine the two systems?

Award points for attendance, and use those points
as a modifier to a random system, or countrawise
use a random system as a modifier to your point
system.

Plan one: roll to a set high number, but with
a low number based on current point total of
each participant.

Thus, player A with 50 points, player B with 20
points, and player C (invited guest) with no points
all want to roll on Drop One.

Roll to 100

A: /ran 50 100
B: /ran 20 100
C: /ran 0 100

All have a chance at the drop, but A has twice the chance
that C does.

How to scale this for how good the item is, as normal
point systems do?  Well, two plans.  One, points are
expended on the item, and how many is based on how
good the item is.  Therefore if A wins on UBERDROP 2,
he spends 30 points but if he only wins on DROP 1 he
only spends 5 points.  One forseeable problem with this
is the negative points phenomenum, not sure how regular
points systems deal with this either, but perhaps the floor
is zero, or perhaps the negative points are banked and
you can't bid at all till you are back at zero?

Secondly, the value of the item itself can be subtracted
from the "roll to" total.  If this plan is added, then the
roll for DROP 1 is

A /ran 50 95
B /ran 20 95
C /ran 0 95

while the roll for UBERDROP 2 is

A /ran 50 70
B /ran 20 70
C /ran 0 70

This means that the better the item the more likely
it is to go to high point value people in the guild, and
yet anyone coming to the raid -might- win the best
item that drops.

This system would require a loot officer with a
current point list and the ability to figure out point
values of drops rapidly.  Each person should be
told their "low end" at raid start, so the officer need
only announce the "roll to" number, and then be
ready to check the winner's "low end" to be sure
there is no mistake being made, and then update
his "low end" for the new current point total.

I also proposed a cap to low end, in the case of
a 100 point system with a max item value of 30
I figured noone should have a low end higher than
60.  As low end approaches or (worse) passes the
lowest high end the system falls apart.  How close
you want those two ends to approach each other is
part of the "details" though and has nothing to do
with the idea for the system itself.

Of course you'd probably want to multiply all point
values here by 10, so that rolls are from 500 to 1000
rather than 50 to 100, so that large raids don't see a
lot of people rolling the same result.  Still, if equal
numbers are rolled for the high roll, you just do a
roll off using exactly the same roll; A rolls 50 to 70
again while C rolls 0 to 70 again.

How many points to accord per raid, how many to
value each item at, where to set the high end you are
rolling to, are all more "details" that need to be
discussed on a guild by guild basis.

Another possible plan is to also add in the level
of the character.  Since I originally developed this
plan for a guild where characters ranged 30 to 50,
one of the things they were looking for was a way
to reward the higher levels with a better chance
at the loot.  In a guild where most people are in
the high 50s or all 60 this part wouldn't be very
important, and I'm not convinced it was ever really
important... but there it is, and shows the adapability
of the basic idea.
