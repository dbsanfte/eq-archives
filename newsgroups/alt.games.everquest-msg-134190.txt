I was wondering if anywhere here played on sattelite.  It's the only thing
besides dial-up that is offered in my area.  I didn't think it would be good
for EQ, because as I understood it, there is a short gap in the time it
takes the information to get to you, then you get it all at once.. so it's
fast, but that gap between the asking for the information and receiving it
would destroy eq.   Please correct me if I'm wrong, as I would definately
like a better connection as opposed to my three diel-ups.
