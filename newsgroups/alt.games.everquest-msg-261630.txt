I think what's he's saying is that he can kill them now, but if all he
had was drops (e.g. Fine Steel) he might not be able to.   

Seems like the one possible "fix" to mudflation that no one is
mentioning is having gear "wear out".  Dunno if I'd like that, most of
what I have I bought in the bazaar.  But w/o either no-drop or stuff
wearing out, seems like mudflation is guaranteed.

I would say that I have a special fondness for the gear that I
actually got as drops.  My druid still has in the bank the Stone
Etched Velium Mace (or whatever it's called) that he got off a named
Tizzy.  My wife and I got them early in Velious, and actually had
people coming up to us asking us where we got them, trying to buy them
off us, etc... one of the very rare times I had "cool gear".
