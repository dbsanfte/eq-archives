I saw Mr. Blair speaking on television today and he said that he was "doing
what he thought was the right thing for the country" in front of a rabid

I'd like to see an army of battlemechs at some point, preferably created by
the French, and at just the last moment. Hint: Robots are impervious to
biological weapons
