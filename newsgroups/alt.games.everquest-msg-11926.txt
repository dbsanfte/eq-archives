I'm kind of curious how you and Taras are defining "gun fanatic".

Is it someone who...

has an interest in firearms?
has an unhealthy interest in firearms?
is a trained marksman?
is a militia moron?
is in the anti-government faction?
shoots at a range regularly?
is a hunter?


The term is somewhat imprecise.
