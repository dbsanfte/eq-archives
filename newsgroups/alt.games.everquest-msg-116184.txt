Sows I usually do for nothing. People who "expect" it get put on ignore.
"Could I bother you for a spirit of wolf please, kind sir? I can donate a
few gold if necessary" will work a lot of the time, tho bear in mind a lot
of druids dont keep it memmed. Dont send them tells, and try to keep up some
semblance of roleplaying.
To convert currency... if you go to the bank and drop 800 copper on the
solver slot, youll see 80 solver. (etc etc).
I just keep 2 types of coins in my bank... copper and plat. Less messing
about.
