This reminded me of what happened to my just yesterday.... I am in OoT
on the Goblin Island next to the Sister Island.... and having a fun
time with pet...(im level 16 also by the way Jazz)

well got this old shaman down and all of a sudden he makes a death
sprint off to the top of the hill..... where all the other goblins
are, and of course my pet still has a grudge against the shaman so is
running after him...

I say " O shit".
Being the intelligent Erudite that I am... I get up my Gather Shadows
to disappear before all them come  (yes I do know "NOW" this does not
wipe aggro or their knowledge of where you are at)

needless to say...the whole Island wanted to greet me with a good ole
blanket party.

Now, this old Necro has been practicing my abjuration to get it up so
my FD will work when I want it to.

Good hunting to all
