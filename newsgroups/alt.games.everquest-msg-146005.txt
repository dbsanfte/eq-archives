No patch message.

Main game file and spell file were changed, as well as a couple of txt
files.

I imagine the joker who made the 'cast on you' message for the new SK
spells read 'Welcome to the SK Test!' got his knuckles rapped - that was
prolly changed.

Also be a while until monks with 7khps and casters with monk hps fully
recover. MGB on Marzin's Mark was stacking with Aego hehe. I think that
was changed in the late night e-patch though - buffs had been removed
when people logged back in IIRC

Found the new bard mez/stun in Ssra - dunno if that was a bug or correct
loot table.
