Check out this great site that is giving away totally FREE Sony PSPs!

I have joined and I think you should too.
It is a completely legitimate offer, and this company has already given away
$8 million in FREE stuff!
All you have to do is join, complete an online offer, and refer friends to
do the same.  That's it!

Take the DVD offer. It's only $12 for 5 DVD's and you're done. Wouldn't
you pay 12 bucks for a PSP?

 Here is my referral link. To get your own Sony PSP, and help me get mine,
click this exact link to join, or copy and paste it into a browser.
