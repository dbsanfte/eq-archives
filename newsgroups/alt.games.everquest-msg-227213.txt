Thats the lamest excuse against Clerics I have ever heard. "They cant invis
themselves they're so dependant" Warriors and Paladins cant invis themselves
either does that make them lesser tanks? Lesser than what, a *RANGER*? Oh no
SK's can invis themselves thats obviously your tank of choice....  BTW I can
invis myself so does that make me better than a Druid now or are you gonna
hold the whole port/sow thing against me now. Well yeah its got a cast time
and I guess Druids have that whole instant invis AA so they're still better
than me. Eh, more power to y'all Ill just go LFG and get a group that
actually needs me in .05 seconds.
