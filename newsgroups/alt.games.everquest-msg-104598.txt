    Amazingly, as a cleric I can't port myself. So I either have to find a
taxi, or hook up with one of the guild taxis. As the biggest sack of
potatoes class in the game I also need to go get Invis potions/charges on my
Larrikan's Mask/an Invis/Camo from the porter.

    That's an exploit, and I refuse to do it. Call me unrealistic or stupid,
but I refuse to camp in that corner and exploit zone geometry to get sent to
the far side. My choices are get a succor across (be a sack of potatoes) or
run the route across and cross my fingers, because a death will piss the
entire raid off.

    Naw, you need to be on my server. Your monk checks the golems - do they
have a one hander? If so, get everyone there ASAP. Do none of them have one
handers? Let the local "we wanna be uber" guild go in and clear them, since
they need every primal they can get and will clear them. Works great for us.
