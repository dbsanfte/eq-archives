Smithing is needed to make them or buy them off a PC smith....they are
pretty common items to be had and most basic smiths can manage the studs.
PLus the stuff to make them with tend to be NPC merchant buyable.

When your skill hits that trivial number you will no longer be able to
advance the skill making that item. The difference between the trivial and
your current skill should also be a rough guide to how hard it will be for
you to make something....bearing in mind that trival does NOT mean
automatic success you'll still fail every so often...
