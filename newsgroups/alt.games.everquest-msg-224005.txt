What bothers me about all this is that GMs have used this "too much
faction" explanation in the past for shaman epic problems that were later
discovered to be just bugs.  

One GM Pirg talked to said "too much faction" is the problem. The next one
says that specifically "too much woe/envy is the problem" (implying some
sort of flag).  These are not the same thing.  Which is it SOE?  

I've often felt that SOEs idea of balancing is to make folks take turns
being the one on the top, rather than truly balancing it.  Maybe because
the shaman epic used to be one of the easiest ones, if not the easiest,
they feel it is ok now that it is bug-laden and very easy to screw up on.
