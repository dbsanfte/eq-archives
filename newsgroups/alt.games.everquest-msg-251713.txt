I take it you mean the cost of lives, as that's what David's paragraph
you quoted is refering to. No where does it mention monetary cost, which
makes your next paragraph..

A bit odd as suddenly you are talking about a financial cost, unless
pirating software has some life threatening side effect I'm unaware of.

So, your argument is essentially that drugs are dangerous and people
should be protected from the deadly dangers by only having access to
illegal drugs which are inconsistant in quality, often injected with
infected needles, and the purchase of which can result in dealing with
people who might kill or severely injure you. Is that about right, or
was this a sidetrack?
