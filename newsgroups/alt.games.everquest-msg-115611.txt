Sounds like my own experience there, except that after my own rez (with 
five minutes to go on the timer) I managed to start casting gate as soon as 
I saw the tidal wave of mobs headed for the wall, and I gated out just as 
the first of those mobs took a swing at me. Definitely not a moment for one 
of those "your gate is too unstable and collapses" occurences. :)

I wish I had had the presence of mind to take a screenshot. I've never seen 
so many mobs in my life. Coming my way, no less.
