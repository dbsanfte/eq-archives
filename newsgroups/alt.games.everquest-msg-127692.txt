Charming the mob is not practical, as there is a bouncer standing right next
to him, and one or two other NPCs in the same room.  I just completed the
quest last night with my Enchanter in DE illusion.  You would have to do an
AoE Mez first, then try to charm Clurg, and I don't thinkg that is a wise
thing to do generally speaking.  I believe, but have not tried, that wolf
form is supposed to work, so long as your religion is not an issue.  My
Enchanter is an agnostic high elf.
