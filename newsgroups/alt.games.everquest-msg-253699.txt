Robert Pfister on the Next EverQuest Update
Dear Friends,

I wanted to pass along a quick update and let you know that we're
shifting the July 8 update back a week to July 14.  As you know from
reading posts from Brenlo or playing on our Test Server, this update
is quite extensive.  This update will include several community
requested features, quite a few bug fixes, and some back-end changes
that, while invisible to you, will help us immensely in the future.
These continuing community driven changes will help us to maintain a
healthy game and to re-affirm to you, our customers and fans, that we
do value your input and, when appropriate, enhance the game based upon
your suggestions.  

As part of our ongoing plan to provide you with the best possible play
experience, we've looked at the testing that went on over the last
several weeks and determined that these changes should spend another
week or so on the Test Server.  When we update, we want to be sure
that the update enhances your play experience; pushing code too
quickly doesn't do that.  I know that many of you are eager for the
changes you've read about or played on Test, however, I guarantee that
the extra week will be well worth your wait.  If you simply cannot
wait to experience these changes, please feel free to join us on the
Test Server.  As always, your feedback is not only appreciated, but
considered one of the things that continues to make this game so
great!

Thanks again for your support and for you patience.


Robert Pfister
Executive Producer
