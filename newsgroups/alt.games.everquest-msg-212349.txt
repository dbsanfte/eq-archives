To bring up a classic parallel: I maintain an Aquarium as one hobby of 
many. With respect to the ihabitants of the aquarium I think there are 
some parallels to being a deity (without trying to be blasphemous...). 
After all I maintain their environment, ensure they have food, oxygen, 
fresh water. I designed, assembled, and maintain their little 
'universe', I choose what goes into it, and what comes out... and more 
or less regulate and tamper with it sometimes on a daily basis...

Although I do derive satisfaction from having a successful 
(healthy/clear/mostly peaceful) aquarium I wouldn't go as far as saying 
that I'm a 'force on the side of good', but I'm not indifferent either; 
and I would imagine and hope that I would be viewed as a positive force 
from the inhabitants were they sentient.

But, pointedly, I have no 'evil' counterpart seeking to destroy them and 
their world. A yin without a yang.

I sometimes propose a deity as a creator / custodian of the universe; 
Interested to be sure, a positive force to be sure, even possibly an 
involved one, but personally involved or even concerned with the minutia 
of my day... not so much....
