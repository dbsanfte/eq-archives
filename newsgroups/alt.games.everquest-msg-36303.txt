Few days ago, had an argument with some idiot in EC that started over
him shouting something about "All hail Lloth!". Boiled down to him
insisting "It's my character and I can roleplay him however the fuck I
want!". Finally told him "fine, don't piss and moan when all the other
roleplayers act like your character is a flipping delusional lunatic
raving about a goddess that doesn't exist..."

I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see...
