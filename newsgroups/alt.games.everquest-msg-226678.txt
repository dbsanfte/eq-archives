Mostly I agree with what you're saying (cleary it's a pain in the ass), but
I have a routine that works pretty well. When I log on I immediately set my
LFG tool up and get busy doing the usual preliminary stuff (banking,
probably grab a KEI) and then I head over to BB (which appears to be the
defacto LDoN HQ on most servers, judging by the posts). I often will have an
offer by this time, but if I don't, I'll do a shout as soon as I enter the
zone indicating that I'm available and will travel (I find that even NRO or
EC recruiters will often start in BB).

Once I get to camp and still don't have an offer, I look over the LFG tool
and start sending tells. Doesn't take long. Like Paul, I don't have much use
for people who say "What kind of group you have, call me if you fill up".
Next! I like creating groups, in an abundant environment I can set up the
team to support the kind of gameplay that I prefer (oh good, an ENC so I
don't have to Haste), and (more importantly), I can avoid getting people who
are on my shitlist. This brings up another topic.

The other night I joined up with my core team's Enchanter. He was starting a
group and he picked up a Warrior before I had arrived . I had previously had
a run-in with this warrior because he had rolled (and won) on a WIS augment.
When I asked him why he was rolling for somethiing that would be of no value
to him, he said it was because he was working on his Blacksmithing skills
and needed it. No matter what I said to straighten him out, it just appeared
like defensive sour grapes on my part and he stubbornly insisted and in the
end I just let him take the augment. This incident completely overshadowed
any recollection I had about his actual gameplay (fortunately the rest of
the group was strong and probably just marginalized him in comparison). So
this evening when my Chanter friend recruited him I re-learned why I should
be avoiding him. Possibly the worst warrior we have ever grouped with
(Lance, you'll remember this guy). So the question I would raise is: Why
doesn't this game have a Shitlist? I hate to put these guys on my friends
list, but it would sure be nice to be able to track a list of People That I
Will Never Group With Again. When you are LFG and building a group yourself,
it would be nice to be able to pull up any comments you've noted on a
particular individual ...
