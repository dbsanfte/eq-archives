    It's true that over the years I've seen several people who loudly
declare "I'm outta here" come back after a while.  I've also seen some who
say good bye who never come back, ever.

   I left, more or less, about four months ago.  I went back once or twice
during that time, because really, I didn't like the idea of giving up EQ. 
I have several friends who play, and I've had alot of fun over the years. 
But when I came back, had a serious case of apathy about playing.  It was
like a chore to log in and do anything.  As much as I wished, I just
couldn't get back into playing anymore.

   I uninstalled Everquest this weekend, something I never envisioned
myself doing.

    So, yeah, he might come back.  But you never know.
