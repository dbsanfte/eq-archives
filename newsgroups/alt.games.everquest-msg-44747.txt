Did you know Mozilla supports all of those things natively? It support 
advanced cookie management, blocking ads (banners and all), pop-ups, and 
I'm not sure about auto-refreshes. Unlike the pop-up blockers I know of, 
the ability to block pop-ups with Mozilla disables the window.open() 
funtion, which means you never see a window pop-up at all. Most pop-up 
programs close it after it pops up. You can also make it so it only 
blocked the window.open() funtion in the onload and onunload.

You can block advertisment banners with the click of the mouse. You can 
pick and chose what servers are allowed to have cookies stored, either 
through warning boxes or pre-set it all.

Basically everything that you could ever need. IE requires plug ins for 
everything :p
