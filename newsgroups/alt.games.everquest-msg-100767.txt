FWIW I'm completely uninformed on this subject, and not an activist.

Here in the UK we've had media report after media report of increased incidence
of leukimia in the population near sellafield, one of our nuclear plants,
of fraud in safety inspections, of a culture of "enterprise" management that
places profit before anything, of inept and inefficient proceedures and of
those proceedures being ignored *anyway* by the watchdogs.

The nuke industry in return plays TV adverts of pretty flower fields inviting
us to visit the sellafield visitor center and fuzzy images of "science" helping
our lives - pacemakers, old people enjoying little electric carts, etc.

So , on the one hand we have specific targeted complaints coming from
official inspectors...

...and on the other we have what is obviously happy trappy bullshit to even
the most naive consumer.

If there IS a good case for nuclear power, why is the industry not making it? 

They're pouring money into these TV adverts with no content. It wouldnt seem
hard to simply say "Nuclear power. Safer than any other alternative. Hard
to believe? See www.nukesaregreatletsgrowtheminthebath.com for the discussion."

Let the "ecoterrorists" contribute. Let the academic community
contribute. Provide a forum for the discussion. Keep what would be
seen as "evil corporate partisan paws" out of the discussion area,
but provide literature that reinforces your position.

And yet they havent done this....

We also see reports stating that, for example, the original estimates of
power station lifespan that the economic case for nuclear power were made on
were woefully optimistic and the calculations didnt include realistic decom
costs anyway; so while nuclear power is cheap while you're generating it
the TOTAL cost ends up being far far worse than the alternatives.

Now, as I said; I'm uninformed. I just read the papers every day and this is
what I've picked up. bullshit?

Oh my lord this is off topic, sorry ;)
