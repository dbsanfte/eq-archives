No "may be" about it, hands down the most useful epic.

Only one other item in the game has the same effect as the Bard epic.

Single best thing about the rogue epic is the +40 ATK that the effect 
gives.  Even with 40% haste elsewhere a lot of rogues will still wield 
their epic (offhand if they have a better backstabber).  Given that this 
can be done in a couple days there's really no reason any guilded rogue 
shouldn't have their epic a few days after dinging 51.  I laugh when I 
see rogues in our LFG channel putting "epic" in their message.

>

As I understand it the effect is similar to the rogue and ranger 
(offhand) epics.  This one is a bit more of a pain to get with having to 
scout for all the scouts.

Girlfriend's monk hasn't done the raster or targin camps yet, but those 
seem to really be the only big roadblocks here.  The effect on it is very 
nice.

I'll have to explain this to the 64 mage in my guild who still wants to 
raid Sky for her epic.

>

Passively pursuing this one on my alt at the moment, seems fairly easy.  
And a mana-free DoT is always welcome :)

SK in my guild says that the proc on his is like having a 25/tick regen 
on him.  I don't think I've actually seen an SK with their epic yet 
though.

Enchanter epic is useful if you can get it early enough.  But past 
whatever level they get SoV at, only monks will ask for it (maybe 
clerics, can't remember if this one stacks with their self buffs).

>

I wouldn't mind a mana-free componentless rune ;)  Especially with the 
ammount of aggro these guys can generate if they're not careful.  
Somewhat of a pain to get though.

Hardest part about getting swiftwind is the Jade Reaver.  Otherwise that 
half is insanely easy.  Earthcaller is all about the wait and pushing 
your guild to raid in Hate as much as possible.  As for utility, the 
haste + atk on swiftwind is very nice considering how easy it is to 
obtain.  And the slow proc on Earthcaller would be very nice for soloing.
