Can see the idea in buying Everlasting Breath. If you for example get 
wipeout on a KK raid, someone have to port to a vendor and get back to 
get some fish scales. Or even worse, if you run out of scales down 
there, or someplace else (imagine drowning while fighting the cleric mob 
in Lake Rathe because you ran out of scales). Helps some with EB items 
of course, but if you die underwater you still got a problem.
Good example can be druid soloing in The Grey. Bound just outside The Grey.
You die, then have to get to a bank to get money, then run to a vendor 
to get scales, then gate back. Loads faster to have the spell.

A lot more limited use for levitation, due to SoE not using components 
too, and that spell being a lot easier to get. But Levitation still have 
its uses (thought it worked on all levels before i read this thread, so 
cuts the use down some). For example when i hunt othmirs in CS, i use 
Form of the Howler to get 2 more mana regen, and fast run speed. But 
since FotH dont stack with SoE, i have to use levitate to hunt 
efficiently (not sure you can do a 10K in CS, but those drops still 
pretty painfull). So i have to have 2 stack of batwings with me at all 
times. If i run out, i risk loosing the othmir camp while i get more 
batwings.

But no, i wouldnt even consider paying 20K for any of the spells. If 
they went for 1K or so i would probably get them, to save some backpack 
space for components, and to solve the above mentioned problems, but 
wouldnt go over 1K for them.
