Yep, compared to current Rap and such even Led Zepplin is very musical
sounding and actually tame, Compare the lyrics of a song like "Been a
long time since I rocked and rolled", to songs that say things like
"all you bitches," "I'm a cop killer", "Fuck", "faggots suck",  with
just a monotonous base track in the background. What is even worse is
when its such a detriment to an entire peoples culture and then white
people emulate it and that whole "gangster" thing, which is also often
hilarious. Eminem is a walking joke and will eventually be thought of
the same way Vanilla Ice is now. Its kind of ironic when you read old
material where people say the same thing about Jazz, but really there
is no comparison. Maybe I am just getting old.
