Put him on /ignore.  Now.  Don't try to explain it to him, you don't owe him
an explanation.  Just stop talking to him.

A friend of mine once had some guy in-game give her a weapon of some sort. 
After this, he'd never leave her alone.  He would inevitably send her a
/tell within minutes of her signing on, and get very indignant if she didn't
immediately come over to where he was and group with him.  She wound up
starting another character to get away from him.
