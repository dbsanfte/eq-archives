Because a rogue over level 40 could pickpocket from
mobs that had platinum on their loot table.

It was cute to pickpocket 1000 copper by 2's and 3's
from an orc pawn in Misty Thicket, but 1000 pp from
the same lizard sentinal in Cazic Thule without ever
fighting went against the "vision."

I personally wish they'd put in the old separate loot
pool but have it behave like the loot now...PP down
to 1 of each coin type, then fail from then on out
(barring items/jewels/spells/etc).
