Sounds like an entirely valid enchanter tactic, with balanced Risk vs. 
Reward.  It's not at all like the tactics bug a while back, where you 
could trigger a war between two factions, and get exp for a whole mess of 
mobs killing each other.

Once you factor in the risks, like the charm resists another poster 
mentioned, the fact you still have to single pull the mobs (the guard 
will usually only take one add off you right away, leaving the other one 
beating you silly), the fact you can get stunned and killed on the way to 
the guard, and the fact you have to do the final beatdown following the 
mob through an area with potential wandering adds, it may not prove to be 
an efficient way to gain exp, though, compared to say, grouping or soloing 
blue mobs in paludal.
