I took my SK there at 29 and have soloed him to 30.  At any given time, over
half of the mobs will be green but there are just as many times when about
everythinge I encounter will be blue.  The Lord is yellow, balltewizard is
blue\white and the battlemaster is blue\white.  I think the change is great
and I am having a blast there.
