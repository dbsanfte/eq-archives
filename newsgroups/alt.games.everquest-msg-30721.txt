I love that saying :)

Remember those bandits in South Karana I was advised to try?  Well, I 
tried them tonight.  Those BASTARDS are REALLY mean.  They hit damn hard 
for greenies.  At first I waltzed in without buffs thinking "screw this, 
I'm saving my mana for the gating between selling orgies".  Well, that 
worked all of ONCE.  I ran through them to see if any aggro'd.  One did.  
Took it down.  Looted.  Sat down to switch in root since I hate running 
after dying things.

Oops.  Sat a little TOO close.  EVERY bandit left aggro'd on me and 
started slowly but surely kicking my ass.  It would have helped if I 
could have decided to finish off the running ones, or turn back to the 
healthy ones, I suppose - but they kept running in the water when I tried 
to finish them off, and I couldn't keep up with them - and then when they 
got *back* they were up to half health again.

Finally ran to bridge, got helped by a friend who happened to be around 
(and got suuuuuuch a laugh out of the whole thing -_-) and zoned just in 
time to NOT die.

Got mad.  Went back to kill again. Discovered the casters have Frost 
Rift.  Ran.  Managed to zone (nobody around that time).

Got madder, buffed HELL out of self, ran back, found one caster, kicked 
it's ass just as I died.

Ran back, looted, rememmed, rebuffed, kicked OTHER caster's ass and 
BARELY managed to finish others off (why did they ALL aggro?????) before 
they did the same to me.

Then I discovered how fast they repop.  I had almost no time to heal, and 
I was out of mana.  Screw it.  I camped and played my level 6 (now 7 - 
yay!) iksar monk.  So so so so SOOOO much funner *g* and I got to take 
out all my frustration on those poor, poor bonecrawlers.

/em lowers her head and mourns the loss of about 2 dozen bone crawlers


*ahem*

Errrr, anyway, in short: soloing can really really SUCK not much later 
on.
