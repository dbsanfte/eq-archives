    That's the way it was implemented, given the (perceived) gap between
casters and melees. But when it was being implemented, the Furors of the
world screamed that this was wrong, that "progression" was being violated
and these exceptional foci effects should be the unique province of
high-level drops. Why is this not the case now?

    And it's hard to claim that AAs weren't a strong part of class
balancing. SCM, until recently, was the single biggest thing that's ever
been done for casters as a whole. And the wizard class has been turned into
a juggernaut with their AAs.

    I'm a cleric. I don't wear that crap, because the stats are poo and more
often than not it does nothing for me. The BotB winning wizard on our server
bought a Crystalline Torque from me rather than wear the earring on raids.
The only thing I still see people at my level getting are the focus bracers,
and more often than not it's a cleric asking for one. :-/

    Where the focus items made a big difference was at the lower levels. Now
a twink caster can have higher damage output per unit time than a non-twink,
same as with twink melees. So as mudflation advances, casters can scale with
melees at lower level.

    To ask this, you have already missed the point of the focus items. Take
wizards. From levels 51 to 59, they are using nukes that were released in
the Kunark expansion. A wizard in these levels has not received much, if
any, boost in damage efficiency or damage output over short-term time since
then. This cannot be said of, say, your warrior in the 51 to 59 range. He
has access to much more damaging weapons, and due to mudflation also has
access to a wider variety of haste items. Those wizards are still trying to
get their nukes from the one place they drop, Kunark.

    Compare recovery time for the two. The warrior's recovery time depends
on health regen (hasn't changed), and damage mitigation/avoidance. AC on
items commonly available has jumped since Kunark, to the point that warriors
frequently "cap out" AC and focus on HPs, resists etc. The wizard's recovery
time depends on mana regeneration. The primary mana regen item a wizard has
is the epic during those levels, and that's Kunark-era.

    Melees had received real advances in power during expansions since
Kunark. Casters had received bigger mana pools. THAT is why focus effects in
general were created - caster power was not scaling over time, melee power
was.

    The only "spreading" method we've seen so far doesn't allow for any
avoidance, but the ability to perma-Evasive means the main tank could try
and avoid hits. Personally I see this as a way to prevent low-HP critical
personnel from catching low-HP aggro during AoE's and being smushed, but
we'll see how much damage the mobs put out. It would have to be absolutely
phenominal, though - just through AAs, levelling, and new buffs, without
*any* new gear, our largest tank will be over the healing value of CH in
raid buffs. I can't imagine the mob that can chew through 10 K HPs on an
Evasive tank fast enough to prevent that CH chain from kicking in.

    If we're talking about a raid, this is hardly a balance. Other than
self-buffs, what damage-increasing spells can they cast on a raid? No SK is
landing a useful DoT as long as a necromancer is there, and knight nukes are
worse than just swinging their weapons.

    The balance I've always seen for tanking ability has been ability to
gain aggro. The easier it is for you to get a mob to hate you, the worse you
should be at being able to handle the consequences of that aggro. This
provides balance in terms of being able to protect the kleenex-wearing
casters - the best choice of protector also takes the longest to get the
situation under control. So overall group efficiency in XP groups shouldn't
be changed whether you get a knight or a warrior to tank - that's balance.
In a raid environment - well, I'll discuss this next.

> Warriors should be *required* to tank all raid level mobs. Period.

    No. This leaves NO tanking role for knights, and that's really what
they're built for. Look at how the classes balance in Vex Thal right now -
this is how I think it should be:

    On standard pulls, multiple unmezzable mobs come to camp. These mobs,
like a Pli Senshali (say), are simply untankable by the non-plate melees
until slowed but MUST be tanked and brought under control when brought into
camp. Because time is critical, here knights are used as MA's and offtanks.
The largest mobs (Eoms), however, are still tanked by warriors as their
damage output is too high for a knight to handle and live.

    On VT boss mobs, warriors are the preferred choice of tank. They can
sustain their hate output without depending on mana reserves, and only they
have the HPs to survive damage spikes and make healing efficient (widened CH
chain intervals).

    Now all the "tanks" have a role doing what they were designed to do -
tank. Warriors are still regarded as the best main tanks, but the quick
aggro-generation that knights have is also highly valued and useful. If by
"raid-level mobs" you meant bosses then we agreed, and this was a bit
redundant to point out. But I think that a tanking role for knights on raids
is crucial.

    The original concept for the class was of one that was as good at
tanking as a warrior in terms of damage taken over time, but which would not
be relied upon as a main tank due to low HPs and the "spikes" of damage they
suffer (low mitigation, high avoidance). They also lack any ability to
generate pure hate, and must rely solely on damage output to gain aggro.

    I think the best way to move things back to this model would be
something like the Aten pants - desired because of ATK effects, but lower AC
so that a monk's total AC is the same as that of a warrior. This should
restore the spikiness of the damage they suffer, given that the AC soft cap
is also raised. Also lowering the HPs of new gear, like on new monk weapons
(would a monk use a 20/19 1HB with 50 HPs over their old weapons? I bet they
would), should help restore a bit of the balance. I don't think changing the
core of the class is required, since only through recent itemization has
this even become an issue.
