Simple as in simple-minded?  Okay, I'll agree.

A necro is even stronger.  His mana pool isn't as affected since
they can convert HP to mana AND gain HPs while fighting.  A necro
is about the only class willing to go into battle below half-health.

That's not really going to be a problem for long anyway.
You're only going to be without gear while you do a CR or
server transfer and kill something.

You don't need to be fast if you're careful and/or can kill
what's in your path.  Never underestimate the power of
simply fearing things you can't kill while you move past
them.  And a druid doesn't have any advantage getting their
corpse over a necro anyway.  Both have invis, if that works.
If it doesn't, they'll both need help (or at least the necro
will need to farm long enough to get a coffin.  The druid's
still screwed.)

Yep.  Necros have all of those too, you know.  How well does camo
work on undead mobs again?

No, you just over-estimate the importance of speed (like most
SoW-capable classes and bards.)   I've *never* had a problem
getting back to a body.  I used to keep SoW potions in the
bank for that until I figured out it was a waste.   Druids
aren't the best solo class;  that doesn't change if they're
w/o gear.  In fact the gap gets worse.
