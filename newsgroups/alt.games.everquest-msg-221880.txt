    Always compute the magic numbers, no matter what your gut tells you. The
senior knights in guild were horrified when they saw that the Crow Footed
Lance (32/20, DB = 14) that they'd been passing over outdamaged their old
Swords of Ssraeshza (52/42, DB = 42). MN for CFL = 39, for Ssra = 34.8.
They'd also been passing on the Ornate Greatblade, aka "that twink sword",
even though it too has a higher MN (36.5). Oops!
