    Face the wall, get an insta-click for the cleric if you can. Speed at
which you can cast DA after casting something else is related to spell gem
refresh rate, which is related to frame rate. You can make spell gems
refresh instantly with an insta-click. Also try to lengthen the time between
when a mob is engaged and when you NEED to land a real heal (DL/CH) by
casting a CE on your tank before the mob arrives. And be ready to DA/DB as
soon as your first CH lands. Think of it as a cleric version of Jolt - throw
the mob off onto someone else.
