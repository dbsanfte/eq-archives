I don't know if this is the same problem, but about 80%
of the time, when I get to the EULA screen, my cursor is
up in the left-hand corner of the screen and the mouse
will not move the cursor. The whole system isn't locked
up, but I can't do anything in EQ. A click on the left
button of the mouse frees up the cursor for me.
