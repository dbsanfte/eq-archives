Hmm.... well I go back to the ole Apple ][e  (very late 70's early
80's) days and dood speak was used back then by hackers and l33t
individuals.  it was so K-rad to talk with k-kool addons and changes
to words.
I am sure it probably predates my days back then, but then I dont know
because I wasnt there hehehehe.
back then everyone had a handle (a name they went by besides their
real name).
my old handle was  Psychedelic Sundae, not that you care or wanted to
know, but eh I gots to ramble.
