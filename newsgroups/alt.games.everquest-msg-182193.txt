Let's say a group is camping, wait for a particular drop.  Another group
wants to get the same monster.  Once the monster drops and the first group
gets it, aren't they supposed to give up their camp for a waiting group
(Assuming they decide to wait)?

Not something I have a big interest in yet, as I have a pretty low character
that still mostly solos.  But I've been watching some other threads here
about Guilds taking all access to a particular mob.  I would think, at the
very least, that is ungentlepersonly (there's a new word), and possibly a
violation of the rules (Under the catch me if you can waiver).

So what is the camping protocol that is really followed?

Is it even legit to "camp" something like the orc hill in GFay, where the
orcs are dropping like rain?  I'd think that's pretty much a free for all
area.

Cheers,
Eric
