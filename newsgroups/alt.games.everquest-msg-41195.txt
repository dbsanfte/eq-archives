I feel your pain.  I went to work at 0700 today and heard about the
attack later in the morning.  We went to FPCON Delta and I was put on
standby staus.  After about a 7 hour day I was sent home to come back
later tonight for mid-shift.  Ick.  

Scary part.

Before I had orders here (Tyndall AFB), I was headed to an assignment
at the Pentagon.  Today would have been my second day at work. 

I did not have the retainability to accept those orders so I was sent
here.

Makes ya think...now where is my flak jacket and my canteen???
