This morning I was in Pauldale (SP!?) Caverns (zone south of ShadowHaven on
Luclin).  I was already up to 1 1/2 orange bubbles EXP when I logged on.  I
quickly (2 kills or so) was slightly over 2 orange bubbles EXP.
    Then I started having some problems.  My pet would get aggroed by 1 or 2
adds while fighting (those blue monster things that give spreading crud
disease).  He'd die, then I'd not be able to get feign death off without
being interrupted (3-4 were pounding on me), or I would get it off but not
all of them would see it.  I died a time or two.  I then started fighting
that lady on the wall to the left after the bandits near the zone line.  I
got killed by her 3 times.  She did con yellow, but was hitting for 50 each,
and fast too.  My pet who always was dark blue, often high dark blue, would
get killed within 20 seconds, sometimes would last almost a minute.  She
resisted most of my fears as well as some other spells.
    My fighting technique was this.  First buff myself with shielding &
spirit armor.  Buff pet with focus death & spirit armor.  Med to full mana
(about 1-2 more bubbles).  Pull with shadow vortex (the 12AC tap).  While
she was running to me I'd leach life, send pet in, fear, heart flutter, pet
& I would chase, fear every 30 seconds or if it broke early, siphon STR,
keep leach life up, try to heal pet when could, and med during the rest
until she died.  I normally kill her this way.  Today she would break fear
VERY quickly, resist 1/3-1/2 my spells, mainly fear, kill my pet VERY fast,
then finish me off, not giving me much chance to feign death, or I would but
she'd ignore it.
    After 3 deaths from her, I assumed she must be a +2LV yellow con rather
than a +1LV yellow.  So I gave up and tried bandits.  Pulled 1 & 2 more came
in.  Killed pet, camped my feigning corpse, would walk away (far), let me
get up, come running back with SoW to kill me before I could get further
away from their area.  Then fighting those other monster things (the
spreading crud casters), I had similar happen again.  Kept coming out of
no-where, killed pet VERY fast, 3 light blues fighting my buffed high dark
blue pet would kill him, resist many of my spells, then kill me.

I *WAS* LV23 (1/2), with 135 base INT, 154 total INT, not encumbered (at
least while I had siphon STR's +8 STR up), and usually died near OOM (unless
they'd gang up and stun me so I couldn't cast).  I died a few times (at
least 2) by light blues (pet too).

I'm now about half a blue bubble till LV23 again.  Anyone able to give some
better advice on a SAFER tactic or place to hunt?  Sure this zone has a high
EXP gain, but apparently not today.  Was it bad tactics or just REALLY bad
luck?

By the way, I'm using my new ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 (64MB AGP) with
all Luclin textures & models, graphics quality set to high, and no more
video lag, plus things look better too.
