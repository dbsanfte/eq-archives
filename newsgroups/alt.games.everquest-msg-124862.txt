There's (normally) nothing except 2 NPCs, one is about halfway to the end,
Marissa Clothspinner or something, most likely on some Qeynos faction, and
the other is some warrior epic NPC at the end of the canyon and most likely
not KoS to anyone.  You should still be careful as you never know what kind
of stuff people will train down there, of course if you're over level 20 or
so the only thing dangerous in the whole zone is hill giants and you should
be able to see one of those coming down the canyon ;)  Although I see no
reason for someone to train anything in the canyon unless they were running
for highpass, fell off and died.
