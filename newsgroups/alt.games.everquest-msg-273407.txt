Almost all the people in my guild who retired/took breaks to play EQ2 are
back playing EQ1 and raiding with high frequency.

Infact the only people still playing are those who quit EQ many moons ago
(3+ months prior to launch) thus presumably killing their remaining ties
with the game already.

But yeah... were dieing /nod
