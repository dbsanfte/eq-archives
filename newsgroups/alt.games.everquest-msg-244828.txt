Was in POJ with my 65 Shammy and 54 Zerker today.  Was pulling the four
mobs from the hallway leading to Mauvin's dungeon.  All was going well
until I pulled the second of the Punishers with my Zerker.

Pulling him back to fight was confronted with the mob's head only ..
zerker hit him about one in five with the message "target is too far
away" on his screen.

The interesting thing is that my Froggie Shaman could see the mob no
problems and he was on the ground, as per normal.  As the fight
progressed turned all my players around to see whether the different
perspectives changed the npc's.  Nope ... the Zerker still only saw his
head and the Shammy saw a normal mob.

Radeon 9600XT on the Zerker's machine and Radeon 9800 Pro on the
Shammy's ... interesting.  Anyone else seeing similar?

regards
