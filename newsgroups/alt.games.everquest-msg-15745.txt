I plan to give all my dropable uber goodies to my guild.  More likely
I'll give it to friends, because I think EQ will be fun for me as long
as my guild is still there.  If my current guild disbanded, I would
probably just quit.


I plan to charm a hill giant and hand him my enchanter epic, because I
wonder if it will be visible wielded.


Then I will go back to my guildmaster in Ak`Anon, wave goodbye, and
camp out.
