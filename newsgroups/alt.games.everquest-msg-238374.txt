Yeah, I had no misconceptions about it.  To a degree I'm pleased that
it lasted this long.  I was just posting confirmation of the results.

The only other games I play are turn-based strats, and framerate isn't
quite an issue there.  So there has been little drive to upgrade.  I
knew there would always be a better card on the horizon, so I've held
off on the urge to upgrade until absolutely necessary.

Looks like that time is a few weeks away =)
