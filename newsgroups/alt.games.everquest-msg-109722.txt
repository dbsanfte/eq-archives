The reason so many people can't be bothered to make tailored backpacks
themselves now is that it is so difficult to get the skill to a level
where backpacks can be made with a reasonable success rate. If they
make it easier to master tailoring, this will change and more people
will be able to "be bothered" with making them themselves.  Two things
will result: The demand for those made by others will go down as more
people are making them themselves, and the number on the market will
go up...as more people are making them themselves.
