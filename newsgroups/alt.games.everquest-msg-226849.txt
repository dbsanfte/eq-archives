Yeah, I knew that (about only those in zone getting the split)...I just 
screwed up and split before the last one had zoned in.  That's why I 
decided to give her the share I got.  I felt bad, as it was MY mistake, 
and would do it for anyone  grouped with me.  It's not that my char's are 
rich...far from it.  I need all the plat I can get (my spells are getting 
expensive), but felt that in this instance, 44plat just wasn't worth 
someone else missing out on *WELL EARNED* loot.

And I didn't do the math to make sure I could get it as even as I could, 
as I was thinking that /split would break it down some.  I did, however, 
add a plat or so of my own to make it more even...the total was 168p and 
change, so I kept the change and took the plat to 170.  If I had spent a 
few minutes figuring it, I coulda got it out to be exact for each person,  
but......

And thanks for the info.  I'll know better next time.  I hope I'm NOT ML 
any more, since gnome wizards aren't know for being able to carry alot 
(got encumbered even WITH str buffs), but if need be I will.  A few more 
seconds of my groups time would be worth it to them, I suppose.

Live and learn, I guess.  But no one has said whether or not I did the 
right thing giving up my share due to my screw up...but I think I know 
the answer to that, and was just looking for some validation :)

Anyway, GL in game, and GL on finding a strong, well played group to all.
