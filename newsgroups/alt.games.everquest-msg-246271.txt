I'm not a member of those circles, so this is what I heard second-hand.  =)

When you open a box in an LDoN, the client is actually "killing" the box
"mob" be damaging for an insane number.  This hacker was able to work out
how to apply the opening of LDoN boxes to any mob; he'd "open" Sontalek and
kill him instantly.

That particular bug has apparently been fixed.
