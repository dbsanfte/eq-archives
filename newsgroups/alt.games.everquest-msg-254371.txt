Playing yesterday, I got my first crit while throwing axes, threw one 
for 52 points.  Ooh.  Weilding my 25/50 axe, I got a couple crits, only 
one for more than my normal damage range max of around 75; I crit for 
100.  The crit rate was quite low, and I wasn't paying a whole lot of 
attention to it, I don't think it made a significant contribution to any 
fight I was in... and not once did someone say "hey, nice crit", as I've 
sometimes seen people say in groups.

All in all, as I expected, eye candy and not very sweet eye candy at 
that, although it did put the 34 warrior's crits (high end about 36) to 
shame.
