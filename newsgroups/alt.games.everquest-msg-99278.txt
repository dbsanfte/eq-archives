I leveled a warrior up to level 51 before I stopped playing. I can tell you
that at your level and beyond it is pretty much an impossibility for you to
solo. Most mobs that will give you experience after lvl 30 or so are
designed to be a challenge for a group of 3-6 people to kill. Tough as they
are, warriors cannot usually withstand the barrage of damage a 30+ mob deals
out.

Even if you are able to kill a mob at that level, your hit points are now
tragically low and you must sit and rest up for the next 30 minutes. I'm not
sure if anybody still fights in Lguk anymore, but lvl 36 is a great time to
start finding groups there, as tanks are usually needed consistiantly. If
you do fight in Lguk, go in with the understanding that you WILL die from
time to time, but the amount of both experience points gained and experience
of group management in dangerous surroundings is well worth it.
