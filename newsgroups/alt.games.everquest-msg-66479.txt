Look at your AC not your stats.

Here are the current
Monk weight limits:

Level  1-14, Limit 14.9
Level 15-29, Limit 15.9
Level 30-44, Limit 16.9
Level 45-50, Limit 17.9
Level 51-54, Limit 18.9
Level 55-59, Limit 20.9
Level   60,  Limit 24.9

Once you go "OVER" the above limits you wall start to lose Armor class
in increasing increments.
