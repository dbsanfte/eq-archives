Ya know - TV news report episodes like this that goes over how people
blow their lives away in video games or related is totally
hypocritical.

I mean shit - you're doing a TELEVISON NEWS REPORT about video games on
TELEVISON!.  Not like people havn't killed themselves over a reality tv
show ending or something like that over the years.  Not like that
telvision is by no means ANY better than video games in the "spending
too much time on something aspect". Not that like people haven't wasted
their fucking lives away watching television since the 40's..

Shit - 10 hours a week as quoted by one guy (as it it's a fucking crime
or someting) where the average adult watches something like over 20
hours of television a week.  Fucking ass-hats.  The media is full of
fucking retards, and the retards that believe every word they utter
only spreads like a cancer eating away at us. =)

You know what I say, go ahead - make video gaming look bad so parents
say to their teenagers "Don't play video games, they're bad for you.
Watch some television, or go out with your friends" which by then the
kids go out and hang out, get bored after 15 minutes of staring at the
wall. Then go to smoke a few joints or something - yeah... MUCH BETTER
than playing games for a couple hours).

I love being sadistic - it's great!
