Hmmm, I know I used that loom.  It was annoying tho, as you
had to stand in the right spot and click in the right spot
to get it to open (behind it and click on top bar, iirc).
Or at least I think that was one of the two I discovered
required "special handling' to open.  I could be confusing
one with another, it's been a long time.
