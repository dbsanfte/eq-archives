Exactly what I wanted to say but didn't b/c I didn't want to be
insensitive... but I changed my mind.

You have to understand, my friend, that your son's being "sensitive" and
sheltered is not a good thing.  If he's so easily hurt that you have to
protect him from a game in which his character is hurt by other players,
then what do you think is going to happen to him when he goes out into the
real world?  Do you intend to keep him in his room watching TV and playing
with Barbies for the rest of his life so he won't get hurt?  Sorry if you
think I'm being cruel but what you're doing is being over-protective and
under-responsible.  I'm not arguing that you don't love your son --
obviously you do -- but I am saying that a kid who is so sensitive that he
can't play a PvP game without being seriously emotionally damaged is going
to be toast in the real world.  Let him experience some of the hurtful
things in life and learn how to deal with them.

Anyway... this has nothing to do with this newsgroup but I've seen that
happen and I've seen what it does to people, keeping them in a closet when
they're kids then letting them loose in the real world when they grow up.
I'd hate for you to think you're helping your son and then be astounded when
he goes to college and has a mental breakdown or something (I assume he's
homeschooled?)
