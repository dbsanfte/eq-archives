    Ok, so I died in orc alley in Oasis.  No big deal, it was time to sign
off any way!  The thing is the next day I retrieve my corpse, kill a few dw
crocs and camp for the night.  Nothing out of the ordinary...
    Next night I log on, get to the character screen and there's my necro
with no weapon.  Did I get drunk and die in croc alley?  I didn't think
so...Find my corpse right where I picked it up the night before in orc
alley.  WTF?
    So I get over that pretty quick, find a full group of 6 that's heading
out for an ogre hunt.  Lose one when the boat zones because some donkey
didn't even KNOW what the Kunark expansion was.  Kill a few ogres, another
group mate signs off.  Fine, so now we have 4.  Kill a few ogres, I'm
getting tired and announce I'm heading out soon.  I'm the highest level in
our group and the puller pull two ogres that are red to me.  I cast one
little spell and they both aggro on me bad.  Oh yeah, another guy goes Link
dead leaving us with 3.  I'm the highest level and they are beating me bad.
They finally go after my skellie and a group-mate.  All are almost dead.  I
Gate to North Freeport.
    Whew!  Made it!  Time to sign off.  I camp.  10 seconds left to camp, my
necro dies.........?  That's all it says.  You died.
    I am "reborn" at my bind spot, scroll up, and see that I never had any
spells on me.  Why did I die?  No problem I'll just grab my corpse since
it's right over......here?  WTF?!?!?!  It's not where I was camping.  It's
not even at the zone.  I haven't checked yet, but might it be in orc alley
again?
    Enough ranting...has anyone ever seen anything like this?

Sincerely,
Sharad, worst necromancer EVER!
