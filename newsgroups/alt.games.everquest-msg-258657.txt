This is the single most sobering statement I've heard in the whole discussion. 
I need to get this down now before it REALLY matters!  So, the Planes are
pretty much where the training wheels come off?  I've had a few tense moments
where we worked to pull our fat out of the fire, and a few times where somebody
screwed up and we had to sweat to get things back under control.  However, I've
not yet been part of a total wipe because of a single mistake.
