Its because everytime a new character is created, first the server decides
if its okay, then a GM has to approve it. Sometimes you'll get lucky and no
GM will be available and the server alone will decide if its acceptable. So
basically, sometimes the GM who approves your name the 2nd time will decide
they dont like it for some reason. I've only seen this happen with names
that stretch the naming rules a bit... :)
