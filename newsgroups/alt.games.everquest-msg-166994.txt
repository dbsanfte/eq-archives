Programs like SEQ have charts listing how much it takes, but I dont think
those updated, so who knows if the real values in EQ have changed.

Dark blue cons offer the best xp you can obatin without a group, although
this is up for debate i know.

No formulae from SOE.  They have puposely kept that info secret.  There is
great speculation on many aspects of EQ where the numbers are involved.
Maybe the Pen and Paper EQ will offer some insight.

Good luck, you'll find experience will be easier to manage than numbers in
EQ.  Since there are no "hard and fast" numbers, charts, or formulae, you
hear rumors, and observe more than crunch numbers.  Not that many don't do
this, but it's a harder road, specially if you are new to EQ.

A parting comment, know that EQ changes as you progress through your levels.
You can kill a Dark Blue mob at L10, but good luck at L50 (depending on
class i know).  Where it used to take 100 Dblue mobs to ding, it now take
250.  Where you could once solo, you can't anymore.

My suggestion is go play, have fun, and leave the formulae behind.
