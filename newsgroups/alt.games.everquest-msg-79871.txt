  That's kind of one of the few things that I do like about the new
skeletons.  It's un-natural, but it's also the kind of way that I
might expect a skeleton to run.  Kind of like the "zombie run" which
I've also always been a fan of.

  Strange.  My level 29 shadow knight summoned a pet next to my level
30 necromancer friend, and I looked at them side-by-side, and the only
difference that I could make out was that mine was bigger. :\  Is it a
subtle color difference, or something that's absolutely obvious to
you?  Maybe they just haven't worked all the bugs out yet.
