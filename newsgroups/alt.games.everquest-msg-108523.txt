I'm not complaining about the class, I love the class and wouldn't change. I
complain about the Druid bashers. As I've said before, I am quite happy
going along on raids just throwing in a couple DD's and healing the
Cannibalizing Shaman and other casters caught in AE. I may even get the
chance to succor the group out, saving the guild some CR time (THANK YOU for
the new lesser succor spell).

I do have a sore spot about the "you chose" argument. When I chose Druid,
Druids could port all over Norrath, and were needed in groups for this
ability. Not so since the addition of Luclin, not only can't druids port to
or around Luclin, the addition of the Nexus portals have reduced the need
for Druids as porters. AA abilities and new magic items have also "balanced"
druids out of favor. My point is not that Nexus portals are bad (they are
not), just that game balance has significantly tilted away from Druids over
the last year - hence my aversion to the "you shoulda known" argument.
