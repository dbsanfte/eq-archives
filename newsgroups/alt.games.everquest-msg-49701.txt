Obviously.  Got sloppy there, I'm not contesting that at all.

Have two stacks of bat wings on me too, not as though I was in
any danger of running out.  Just didn't think things thru, having
not fought on the islands with a character that could levitate...
perfectly good escape mechanism and I didn't even have it memmed!

On the other hand, do you happen to have a source for mob
resistances?  Or do you think, as I do, that there likely isn't
one out there to be found?
