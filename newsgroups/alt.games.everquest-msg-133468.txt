I imagine that if Usenet was around when Star Trek showed the first ever
on-screen interracial kiss, the discussion would've been the same.
"Think of the children! This subject is unsuitable for them! They cannot
comprehend the details of bigotry and racism!" Yet now a lot of the
stigma attached to interracial relationships (and black role models in
general - Uhura was the first televised black women in a position of
control IIRC) has been removed, they are commonplace and don't even
raise an eyebrow in the media and/or *most* western societies, yet I
don't see children 'missing out on their childhood' because of it. Once
people get over the fact AIDS isn't a 'gay curse', nor is it inherently
evil to be 'gay' anyway, then AIDS will simply be another disease people
can openly discuss like cancer, MS, or leukaemia.

Isn't there a wheelchair-bound character in Sesame Street already, or am
I getting mixed up (been a while since I watched - heh)? Would they
fully explain what put the person in a wheelchair, going into the
technical details and graphically showing the deterioration of
degenerative bone/nerve disease? Or did they just say ,'This person is
in a wheelchair. *Shrug* So what? They're still a person'. I fail to see
any evidence that they wouldn't treat this subject in the same manner.
