People have tried to eliminate crime for millenia, and have always 
failed.  Its a fool's game, no matter how harsh the penalties, no matter 
how vigilant the forces opposing it, its never been possible to prevent 
every instance.

While you might -like- to eliminate all terrorists, in practice this is 
impossible, unless perhaps you do so by eliminating all humans.

Oddly, you mention mice.  Humans have tried to eliminate rats from their 
cities since... well since we've had cities.  Thus far, its been 
impossible to do anything better than reduce the problem to a nuisance. 
   Mice?  They hardly even rise to the level of nuisance... but I assure 
you they are also in every city in the world.

As long as it strikes anyone as -possible- that they can achieve their 
political ends by means of causing (or threatening) terror, then those 
people are all potential terrorists; they don't have to be muslim, or 
irish, or chechnian, or basque... take Timothy McVeigh as an example.

  Nothing prevents the next terrorist from being a jewish black woman 
from  Oswego who wants Martha Steward freed decides to get attention for 
her cause by dumping ammonia into the chlorine tanks at YWCA's around 
the country.    You can't stop her because you can't predict her 
existance or her methodology... and even if you -do- manage to stop her, 
you have no idea where the next terrorist is coming from.

As I said before, the best approach I can think of is to discourage the 
practice as much as possible; not hoping to eliminate it (which I feel 
is impossible) but to reduce it down as far as possible.  Nuisance might 
be an insensitive term to use for this, but its the right idea.
