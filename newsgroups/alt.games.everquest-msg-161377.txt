I wondered about that the first time I got there, then I noticed no
one else seemed to be having a problem. I figured, must be the simple
solution, and it was. One of the vendors sells them, its the top item
on their list. The one closest to the front wall on the right looking
inwards in the middle building where all the craft supply vendors are,
if I remember correctly. Its been a while.

Mm. It's the bandits that are the real exp there. If you remember
nothing else, remember that. :-p Everything is good there, but nothing
is bandit good.
