Because, if it's someone like the enchanter or the wizard gets aggro 
while you wait the agonizingly long time it takes for the taunt to 
refresh, you may not need to taunt, as he will be dead, and you will be 
at the top of the hate list again.  Tissue paper wearing caster gets 
aggro, takes 80% or more damage, if not dead, is probably low health now, 
and thus keeps aggro, no matter what you do, unless the cleric manages to 
heal him in time.
