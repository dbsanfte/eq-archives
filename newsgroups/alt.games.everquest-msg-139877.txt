I *Guess* its this way:

When on Luclin, porting to Nexus means they KNOW that you have the SoL 
expansion (You are there already)
When on Norrath they would have to check if you have SoL when you cast 
Nexus gate, and handle the case when a non-SoL wizzard casts Nexus gate.
(and for members in your group too)
The fact that they already did handle that piece of coding in the Spires
code obviously didn't slip into Verants minds.

Maybe the 15 min spire turnaround is because thats the time it takes to
batch syncronize the servers with subscription information.

The fact that you can gate to a bind spot on Luclin is again because when
you are able to bind on Luclin, the SoL-check has already been made.

I have all expansions so I dont know how it's handled when you cast a 
gate to DL, and you dont have the Kunark expansion...


Its just a guess though.
