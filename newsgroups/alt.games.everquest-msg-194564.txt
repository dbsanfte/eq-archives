Make an alt.  Twink him a bit perhaps, heck, you have 19kpp handy and dropping
some of that won't really affect your bard much.

Play around with another class, heck, maybe more than one.  Level them up to 30
or so... take a week or two.

There are spots where the game bogs down, 51 is one for a lot of people, 30 or
so tends to be another; so that shiny new character that's so much fun to play
may lose its luster around there.

You may also find you miss your bard after some time off from him.

I strongly advise not stripping him down to fund an alt; twinking decently isn't
really expensive.  With 1K worth of gear you can make an abusively overpowered
character for levels 1 - 10.  For 4K of gear you can be abusively powerful
11-20.  For 8K of gear, 21-30.  Still loving the life but wanting to be
overpowered, blow the rest of your 19K on the 31-40 stretch.  I wouldn't
consider stripping down the bard until that point, when you'll need to be
blowing 40K to keep that same feeling of superpowered killing machine.  And
sadly even then by 51 you'll be back in the same boat you are now; a well
equipped but not "twinked" character hitting the wall, because leveling 51-52 is
radically harder than leveling 41-42 was.

The other approach is to deliberately not twink at all, even start the new guy
on a new server, and just use your much greater understanding of how the game
works.  Do the newbie quests (most of these probably weren't in game when you
started your bard) and end up with decent gear.  Really learn your new class
that way, and there's a greater feeling of accomplishment to it for some.

Still another is to keep playing your bard, but stop doing what you've been
doing.  Group.  If there's no group handy, make one out of the LFG people.  If
you can't find a group's worth of people, find just one person and duo with
them.  Duo-ing varies more than soloing -or- full group killing, because you
have to tailor what you are doing to the strengths and weaknesses of your
partner.  Honestly most of the time duo-ing will probably be slower exp than
soloing, but it makes up for that by being a lot more fun and interesting, both
in terms of game challenge and of just having someone to chat with, laugh with.
Also, many classes do better duo-d with a bard than they do solo, soo even if
its slowing you down a bit, you know you're helping the other person.
