Do things in there see invis?  If not I think I'd call in the FD'd folks,
then the ones who have improved invis, then folks with standard invis.

I've never done Chardok, but I have CoH'd small raids into areas where 
mobs pathed back and forth past us.  I got there with Veil up, waited
until the mob was moving away - CoH druid with improved camo, hit the
mod rod, invis again.  Wait for mob to move off - CoH tank (the druid
invised him) hit the mod rod - druid heals me, we both invis.  Wait 
for Mob.  Rinse and repeat with the cleric, then other members of the
raid - seems to me an invis broke when we had 8 or so folks up, they
were to keep mobs off me while I CoH'd and the druid healed my Mod rod
damage (this was pre nerf - I'd handed out rods to all and sundry, and
they were returning them to me as I needed them).

Moral of the story, you want to CoH people as quickly as possible after
the people with basic invis start coming in - as you can't use rods any
more for this, I'd suggest you get the mage a backpack of Malachite and
an enshrouded veil.  Also - any cleric should cast the Blessing of xxx
on him that stacks with summoned spell haste focus.  This way he not
only CoH's faster, but regens mana faster from canabalizing pets.

Hope that is of some help - I realize you're not the mage, and he might
already know this.
