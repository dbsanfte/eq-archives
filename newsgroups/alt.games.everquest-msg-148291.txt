You know I did spectres at that lvl also.. it was excellent exp, but I am
always scared to tell people to do it cause it was kinda tough.

You just have to be very careful on them.
Once you learn.. you will fly by with the exp=)

Now im just trying to get a good spot for me(lvl 52 druid)
spirocs are green and light blue and KOS so can't just pull the dk blue
ones, wyverns are turning light blue and always so over camped, and those
bastards in TD are hard as hell they run too fast and have a huge agro range
lol.  well other then that.. i just dot/root lol
