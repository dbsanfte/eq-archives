When TP first started we were a bunch of safehouse refugees in the third or
fourth guild there.
Myself and 2 others would jump/lev off the siren island onto the boats and
pillage and plunder the boat riders.
Then go back and kill sirens for awhile till we saw the next boat coming.
Your memory just twigged mine. Too funny.
