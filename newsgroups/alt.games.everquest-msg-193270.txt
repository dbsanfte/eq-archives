my RL buddy and I team up often and our fav. combo is cleric
druid-granted its at a higher level-but my
buffs/heals/rezzs/roots/stuns/lousy nukes, with his Sow (yay-must have
sow), snare(really nice), dots(very nice) and modest nukes seems to
work quite well-plus we can get ourselfs outa trouble rather well,
also easy for travelling!!!-we tried and do use other combo's (more at
the level your talking about) and thier ok, but we come back to the
clr/dru-the key appears to be healing-sows-doting/nukage-decent
ac(crl)   -try a combo that gives you that i suggest   -clr/ war is
good, but kinda slow!!-never did a clr/rang as someone suggested, but
it sounds pretty good-anyway, my 2 cents
-Ironeyes, 53 clr-rathe
