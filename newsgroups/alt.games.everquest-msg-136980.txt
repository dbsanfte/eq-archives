And why couldn't the ENCHANTER adapt? Why not just mez the mob the MT 
switched FROM?? Why does it have to be the enchanters way or the 
highway? Group of six. Everyone save the cleric dies. Who started 
bitching? The enchanter.... the only one. Just me, but if somethings on 
the cleric it I want it off RIGHT NOW!! I don't mind dying, but I'd 
rather have the person there to get me back ASAP. Yeah, it would have 
been great if everything worked out so that no one died. That would be 
wonderful. We'd pat the enchanter on the back and say good job. Hell  
everyone, save the cleric, died and we still pretty much patted everyone 
on the back and said good job (we had killed 7 or 8 of the critters 
before we dropped). The ONLY one who bitched was the enchanter. Funny 
thing is we'd overpulled with the enchanter we'd had before him and we 
had NO problems.. even with the MT switching. Still think it's us?
