Female players or female characters?  

I never noticed a lack of us, though now that you mention it, out of my 15
or so ranger friends, only two are female, and one of those was shared
between a husband/wife team.  Even weirder, all three of us are
half-elves, whilst most of my male ranger friends are wood elves with a
few humans.  *scratches head*  Skewed statistics, probably.
