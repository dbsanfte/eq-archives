I succumbed to the hype and picked up Spirit of the Wood. After a few
days of soloing and raiding with it, SotW is now #4 on my recommended
"must buy" list for druid AA abilities. I am now working on MGB
specifically so I can use SotW on raids.

I used to think my equipment was pretty good, at least before my
extended break from EQ (left in August, came back at the end of
December). Now...well, I just joined the #2 guild on my server. With
the exception of the shawl, I think every item I own is destined for
the scrap heap. (One of the druids in my guild quad-kites the ZI frogs
in PoS....).

Oh: 59 aa points, 17 of those in the past 10 days (guess who got
Command of Tunare muahaha!).
