Seems odd that he would come here to cheerlead and then bad-mouth EQ.
Makes me think he may really be a person, not a paid sponsor for the

The name "Ron Jeremy" is from a porn star, and the email address shown
youwish@eatshit.com is not, uh, friendly.

So, is it a troll or a really weird sort of spam?
And the really hard question:
Does anyone care?
