Legacy is good, in general, but for $22 it's a bit high.

LDoN is a only for mid to high-level (level 30+) large groups (at
least four people).  If you solo, then you will absolutely NOT be able
to use anything in LDoN.  You won't be able to get or use the new
"interactive objects" or augmentations.  Everything in the LDoN is
no-drop, and anything "made" in there is no-drop too.  That includes
all the fancy new tradeskills which is pointless because tradeskills
are a solo activity.

Think of LDoN as a sort of "friends and family" scam -- if you want to
use ANYTHING in it, then your only choice is to find other people with
the same package (expansion) when it is conventient for you to play...
 If you want to explore or do some RPing or head-busting on your own,
then LDoN is explicitly off-limits.

You cannot enter the LDoN areas with groups of three or less.
