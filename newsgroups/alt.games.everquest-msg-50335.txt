As a lvl 40 rogue (Negenea, my main) at Inno server, I need to say even I
play EQ for long, I still have no idea how much I should pay for other
player's service. Thanks all your input and at least give me some idea what
to do next. I agree that players should help each other and that build a
beautiful community.

I should like to say thanks to those druids and cleric those helped me
before!

However, should I say "I will pick your pocket for free"? or "I will open
lock for you for free" as a reply?  :)
