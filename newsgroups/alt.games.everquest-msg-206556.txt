Actually, beastlords of all races, including Barbarians, get their own
armor quests, though not as involved.  They don't get a box where they
have to combine a number of items and combine with a mold or pattern,
they just mainly turn in certain things to the quest NPC for various
BL items (for example, Barbarian BLs, whose armor is called Field
Priest armor, would turn in a white wolf skin to the NPC for a Field
Priest bracer).  I think BLs get five quests which total four pieces
of armor plus a H2H weapon.

However, I've heard that some of the newbie mobs in Everfrost have
been dropping no-drop items so there's a good chance they have added
newbie armor quests for Barbarians; they aren't listed on
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ so maybe, as the previous poster
suggested, you need to ask around the Halas NPCs.

Also, I didn't see Iksar mentioned among the new races getting newbie
armor quests (unless they, too, aren't on Allakhazam and one needs to
ask around Cabilis also).
