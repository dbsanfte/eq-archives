i tried redownloading all the dll's and exe's useing everquest.exe on
verants website this is no scam its a server login that shouldent appear it
should forward you staright to verants login server but it doesent

this problem came from verant theres a post about it on forums it seems to
be conected to win2k is someway basically eqgame.exe cant find the host it
should log into so it asks for one

i figured out the login server useing eqhost.txt but no luck still it says
server is down or some other bullshit
