Everyone always said remap the 'a' and I ignored them.  While asking
for journey to luclin, I must have missed the '/' in front of say.
Never been smacked down so fast, wow......so, lesson learned, I simply
removed attack from a, and since I had put attack on hotkey 1, I
didn't remap it elsewhere because all I have to do is press '1'.
This was all fine and good until the other night when I was already
low on health and a mob snuck up behind me. I spun around, and in my
hurry pressed F1 instead of 1 ( and we all know what F1 does ) then
quickly clicked on careless lightning.  Damn near killed myself before
I caught on to what I had done.  Anyone else have the occasional
keyboard/finger check problems or just me ??
