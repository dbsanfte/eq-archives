LOL, well, for me, all it took was Pong for my complexion to be
completely ghost white. The only form of interactive electronic
entertainment we had before pong was sticking our fingers in the
eletrical sockets.

I went with an Xbox as well. I had fallen out of the console scene (my
previous one was a SNES, which I only played Street Fighter on pretty
much), but when I saw the capabilities of the Xbox, I was sold. Yeah,
it sucked that you had to buy the remote for the DVD extra, but isnt
that bundled with the system now for no extra cost? I of course bought
mine the month before they announced that they were dropping the price
$100 - *screams* but it was still well worth the $300.

On a completely different note, what ever happend to those VR helmets?
I recall seeing them in the early 90s and looked forward to the day
when they would be accepted by the mass market. Seems to me this is
the ultimate gaming device (aside from a holodeck or a matrix thingy).
