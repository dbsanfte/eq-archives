The necro will typically summon his OWN body first...summon corpse is a
serious mana hog, and he would need the int/mana from his equipment to be
able to cast it much. All the better if he has a velious quest/PoG robe,
since that let's him cast it for free, and he'd likely have an ample supply
of small coffins available.
