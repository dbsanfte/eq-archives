Aside from the fact it's 'Sony Online will never be confused with Sony
Ontime' it's 3 hours of Computer Work Time...

3 hours CWT=6 hours real time, trust me I work on computers every day.
In real time bending however, 12 hours of CWT= approx 8, and the other day I
had 10 min of CWT = 9 hours. I think if you could figure out CWT you could
master the secrets of time and space.
