I have no knowledge of the Norwegian language at all and so am in no

Ice - Is, Ise, Glasere
Translating back Glasere comes up as enamel or glaze so left with the other
two choices and Ise looked less like I was saying "is" in English so that
was what was used.

As it is I may get it changed to what I was originally going to use in
Finnish but translated properly...Just occured to me I know someone who is
half Finn...Duh.
