I wouldn't go as far as to say it was cheating, it is just one way of 
playing and since it doesn't affect other players I don't think anyone 
has the right to try and stop twinking or PL-ing.

However I agree PL-ers are only spoiling the game for themselves. Let's 
face it, the playing experience in EQ is not that much different whether 
you are level 8, 28, 48 or what ever, except only that you  spend time 
in different zones. If you PL, then you reach a higher level more 
quickly but you have not had the experience of playing in certain zones. 
For example you would not want to go to BB or CB if you are past level 
25. Also what do you plan to do once you reach L60 or what ever level 
you want ultimately to reach? Just keep going? You won't get bored? If 
you did not PL, then it may take you say 6 months to reach that level, 
that's (hopefully) six months of fun with your character. If you PL, may 
be you shorten it to 2 months and reach the point where your favourite 
character hasn't much to do any more. You decide what's better.

For myself I twink my alts a bit because I want to get past the spider- 
and-rat-bashing stage asap, but after about L8 I want to take my alts to 
zones I have  not been to with my other chars.
