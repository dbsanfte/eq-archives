I'm not, I'm a cleric.  My principle spell is Complete Heal, which
is deliberately not benefitted by focus.  While I -could- use other
foci, I rarely bother, I -do- have pretty good gear everywhere
and don't necessarily want to lose it for the focus effects.

This would be handy when I solo... but when I solo, there's no mage
handy to make me one.  Find out which of the items now are
changed to have this effect and I'll consider getting one for this purpose.

Again, useless in groups for a cleric... but might be handy to have
when soloing... which means no mage.

Doesnt work on CHeal, and its rare I miss with anything else.  Would
give my eyeteeth for one that worked on CHeal.

10% chance to save 10pp... no, I don't ever bother with this.  On the
other hand, chanters in a heavy -run- situation should perhaps be
slavering for it.  Other than clerics and chanters, does anyone use
a component you'd even -consider- bothering swapping items around
for a slight chance of savings?

I suppose this is interesting but buff mana isn't really a huge concern on
an ongoing basis.  Where buffs cost mana is at beginning of a raid
or on mass death.  This won't save mana in either of those circumstances.

Aren't dire charmed pets limited to level 45 and under, and dire charm
a level 60 ability?  Is a dire charmed level 45 mob really better than
a level 60 summoned pet?  I'm not saying its not true... I'm just, well,
boggled.

When I played around with it at low levels, it seemed that the mana I got back
wasn't much more than the mana I spent casting it.  Slammed it in the back
of the book and ignored it.  Like many spells, I suppose its only useful at higher
levels despite getting it at very low ones.

In particular, look at mages, who get reclaim at level one... and no pet spell
till level 4!
