I have 2 crafters, a jeweller and a carpenter.  THe jeweller made me
cahs (and made my jewelry, natch) buy my carpenter was my main
crafter, as I loved making stuff for my room.

However, it's beed a few weeks since I made anything, and can't image
getting past lvl 22, where she's currently stuck.

Like the guy you mentioned, I've sold about 3 beds on the market -
I've given more away to guildmates.

I think I lost interest when the big crafting nerf hit a few weeks
ago, adn it became almost impossible to make Pristine anything - hell,
now I can't ever refine and plane wood and get a pristine...If I grind
away for a few more levels, I can finally make Tier 3 strongboxes, but
I honestly can't be bothered - especially now I'm gettting 2 or 3 new
recipes per level - it gets extremely dull making the same shelves and
bunk beds over and over...

I'm still having fun adventuring with my new Priest, who has just hit
21, and will soon be visiting Stormhold, but my little periods of "I'm
SO close to quitting" are getting closer and closer together.  If I do
quit, I won't bother with WoW, as it's just more of the same.  I'll
probably go back to Anarchy Online, as I miss my Fixer... :-p

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
