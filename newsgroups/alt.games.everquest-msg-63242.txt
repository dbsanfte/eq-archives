You are free to use your Everquest installation CD(s) to
install Everquest on as many computers as you want, anywhere.

You are also free to use your Everquest account login on
any computer which has Everquest installed on it, anywhere.

So there's nothing wrong with setting up Everquest on your
father's computer and playing your characters from his house
while you're there.

You only need a new CD key # to create a *new* Everquest
account.  One account per purchase.  But there's no limit
on the number of different computers you can install and
run your one account from.  (Of course, you can only
run it from one computer at any given time.)  Nor will simply
installing the software on another computer (e.g. your father's)
require a CD key at all -- just install, run, log in,
and start playing.

For convenience, though, be sure to copy your *.ini files
from your current computer onto a floppy to take with you,
then copy them into the Everquest directory on your
father's computer after you install EQ there.  Otherwise,
you'll be missing all of your hotkey settings, your
/friends list settings, etc.
