Hi all,

I did not play EQ since last april.
And already at that time, it had less players every week.
It was hard to find a group (not enough players). When I first went to
DL,there was 70+ players everynight and when I quit EQ , there was only 40
players.

So is it worst now or its the same ?

Thanks
