Alt Enter switches you to full screen and back to what I think you 
currently have, which is EQ in a window that happens to take up your 
whole screen, except that you can see the windows parts at the top and 
bottom.

I'm not sure how you make it appear in a window which you can tile with 
other windows on your screen and see both at once, which would be handy; 
I think I did manage it once but back then my machine couldn't really 
support EQ and anything else running at the same time... and since 
getting a new machine I haven't been motivated enough to rediscover the 
method.

Splendid
