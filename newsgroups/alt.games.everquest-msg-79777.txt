First off...I don't condone foul language in the game for any reason.

For what it's worth, I agree that killing guards that newbie or young
players use for protection is discourteous.  True, there is nothing
officially wrong with it. I have plenty of characters that could get easy
exp off the FP militia guards in EC and WC.  I don't hunt them because I
know younger players sometimes need them when they get into trouble.

Some of the players killing guards will act in the guards place to help out
newbies in trouble...but I think that's a minority.  Then again, there are
those players that kill the guards and laugh while a newbie gets killed
running to the now-dead guard.  I'll let you form your own opinion about
that type of player.
