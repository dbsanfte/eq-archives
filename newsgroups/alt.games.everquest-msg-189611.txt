    Yup my *SK* seems to get better exp soloing than with any full group
he's been in.

    The group bonuses should be increased if they want to encourage
grouping. Soloing with an SK isn't easy or particularly productive but it
still beats grouping because the total DPS is more than 1/6th of a group and
then some. I guess because we add higher than average DPS (yes many classes
add more DPS but many add less, and almost all groups have at least one
person who adds none (healer)), and the fact that fear means little to no
downtime.

    Still, there's nothing wrong with an SK being able to (Barely) solo -
just the fact that we get better exp than grping that way I think is silly.
A group should be able to smack reds day and night and get uber exp.

Cheers,
James
