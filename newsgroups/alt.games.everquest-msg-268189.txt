Now your just being thick.

Does EB sell video games?  Their own site says they do. But they don't!
All they do is sell licensed copies, (new and used). They have never 
sold and for that matter never even owned "a video game".

The word 'sell' is a convenient term that adequately describes the 
transaction. IGE is in no way representing that it somehow own's the IP 
behind evequests currency system, and is selling it. Everybody knows 
that the plat being bought and sold is just being transferred from 
account to account. 

Why would a judge apply your 'defintion' of selling, when it fails to 
represent what IGE is actually doing, and what everybody knows IGE is 
actually doing? And what everybody, in virtually any IP licenced product 
understands 'selling' to be. From magic the gathering online's virtual 
cards all the way down to paperback books.

This is irrlevant.

The EULA is irrelevant to the discussion of what rights ownership of IP 
confers on them. We are discussing what rights IP *actually* gives them, 
not any made up stuff they would like to have and just stuck in the 
EULA.

FWIW Nobody has EVER said that EQ can't go after IGE for violation of 
the EULA. 

They don't even need to take them to court. The remedy for violating the 
EULA is specified in the EULA. They will suspend or ban you. But so what 
if they did? *Nobody* has ever disputed that Sony can ban any accounts 
they see fit to.

The contents of the EULA are not IP rights, they are affirmations of IP 
rights/restrictions, affirmations of any other rights/restrictions they 
think are relevant, and then a heap of made up rights/restrictions Sony 
beleives no law specifically contradicts, and which they expect you to 
agree to as terms for the service/product.

The whole joke about buying MS Office and entering servitude as Bill 
Gates towel boy is a good example. You can put nearly *anything* into a 
contract, and provided the towel boy clause was properly disclosed (it 
couldn't be hidden in the fine print because its way off the boiler 
plate) and didn't break the law (ie you couldn't become his 'slave'), 
and agreed to by all parties it *would* be binding. But there is no 
right to make your customers work for you as towel boys confered by IP 
rights.

Further, the validity of several of the EQ EULA clauses haven't been 
subjected to a court challenge, so there is no precedent to just how 
binding some of its fine print would prove to be. If it were a 'normal' 
contract they'd have a better chance of holding, but the standards for 
'click through contracts' is higher, because the presumption that they 
have actually been read and agreed to is much weaker, so the terms 
generally can't be that onerous or unusual.

Finally: if terms of the eula/contract are found to contradict the law, 
they are voided. So if a court finds that SOE can't legally restrict the 
*motives* for which people transfer game items (After all they *do* 
allow us and IGE to transfer items; its an important feature of the 
software. The only point of contention, is *why* IGE does it!), then it 
doesn't matter what the EULA says.

E.g. Suppose I wrote a series of short stories, and put them in a 
binder. And then gave you access to it with a click-through license that 
said you could trade individual stories for other stories, you could 
lend stories to people, you could give stories away, you could provide 
services in exchange for stories, but you weren't allowed to accept 
currency as part of a trade. Would such a license hold up? I for one, am 
highly skeptical.
