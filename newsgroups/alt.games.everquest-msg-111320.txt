"Selling all on me" are more than half the time /anon, so you have no idea
if you're interested unless you send him a tell.  I never bother.

"Selling bags of goodies" says so little that you have to go to them, stand
in line, and hope your time isn't wasted.  I never bother.

If you don't say the price in the initial auction, I will usually not bother
to inquire further.  If I do bother, I am usually only marginally
interested.  If you give me an insane price I'll not reply but go on to
something else.  If you say "name price" I'll seriously low-ball it, and
you'll ignore ME.

I buy HQ bear skins.  I pay 25p max (plus buffs...either 52 druid or 57 enc,
or both if both are there).  There's so little use for them anymore (deluxe
tool kits from Iceclad make the perfect bank storage containers and cost
less than 5p each) that I really should lower my max to 20p, but I'm a nice
guy.
