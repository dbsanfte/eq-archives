Camping Shadel Bandits today, I found that even at 63 I was
getting all four out of the camp I was pulling.  Rooting 3 and
running the remaining one back out of follow range was a pain, so
I tried out WOT as suggested.

Much to my surprise, it worked.... but not like my dream of a
working Lull.  I targetted the furthest bandit... and got three
clear messages saying the spell stuck.

Harmony gives no message, you have to rely on graphics, as I
recall.

I had NO idea that WOT was an AE spell.

First time, I cast it on each of the mobs I didn't want to pull,
just to be sure.  Didnt fail once, didn't aggro any.  Fourth guy
(the one closest to me) came right along when pulled, all alone.

Later, I went to casting it just on one mob, and it still worked
perfectly... meaning it was really hitting at least 3 targets.

Shocked.
