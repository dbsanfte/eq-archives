I know some people also like Halfling clerics; their WIS is only 3
less than a dwarf/DE but they have better STR/STA than a High Elf/DE
and higher AGI than a Dwarf, plus they also have both hide and sneak
racial abilities and a good newbie zone (Misty Thicket).  They also
get a 5% experience bonus for being a Halfling.  I have heard of
Halfling clerics being asked for SOW and ports a lot, though! ;-)

DE is also supposed to be a good cleric; they also have ultravision
and hide and they can do a quest for a snare necklace (as can Human
clerics and Troll shamans who worship Innoruuk).  

Anyway, whatever you choose, have fun!
