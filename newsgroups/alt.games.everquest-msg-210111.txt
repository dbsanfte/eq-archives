The number is the number of bytes of data per second. Normally (for
me) it runs in the 200 to 500 range, but when I get massive packet
loss that resolves before I get disconnected the game tries to catch
up, hence the large numbers and suddenly the mob you are fighting
might hit you several times etc.
