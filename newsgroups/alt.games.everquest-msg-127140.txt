Hurm.  While I have quadded at 52 in CS with my druid, I got pretty
adept at avoiding drakes because they made things difficult before.
You could be right as that I haven't actually pull any wyverns across
a drake in a while.  I'll have to check it out.

I don't understand why they wouldn't aggro though.  They're still dark
blue to my druid at 52.
