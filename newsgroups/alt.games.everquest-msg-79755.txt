No.

I cannot do any measurable pain to a mob 5 levels higher than I as a druid. 
PERHAPS with dots, I could get him to half before I ran OOM, and there is 
no way I will get a root to stick for any measurable amount of time.

Melee damage, on the other hand, has a chance to hit regardless of the 
disparity in levels- AC is the only factor. Add to that a virtually 
unlimited supply (close to 1000 fully stocked) of arrows and voila! You 
have a VASTLY unbalanced class.

I'm all for realism, but not at the expense of gameplay.
