Verant has explained in the past... There are a lot of regions shown
on the map that are really only there for "flavor". Look at, say, maps
of Pern in the Dragonrider series. There are regions named there that
are never touched in the books...

Some may be added as "bonus" zones like SBM and such, others may only
ever be names on a map.
