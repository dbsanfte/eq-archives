Str adds to max damage but does not effect average damage
directly. The damage a melee character does is skewed heavily
to a 'magic number' that makes a boost to the max damage minimal
at best.

The reason warriors want it is because they see those
big hits and think they do something when the average damage
change is very minor.

I saw log analysis that was done comparing a 50 warrior with 125
str versus a warrior with 255 str and the difference in damage
was a little less than 4%.

Str comes on a lot of gear anyway so its never really an issue
but I have seen warriors pass up an AC 12 belt because they
had a TBB which is AC 8 and +15 str. If I was the tank I'd take the
higher AC belt every time.

But every little bit helps in the long run.

Now str is very important for special skills, like backstab and
flying kick because they increase that damage directly. So
always str buff the rogue and the monk.
