Nice viewpoint, and if *you* are a cleric it may always be right, but for
the non-cleric it's wrong more often than not, with non-cleric groups,
non-intelligent-cleric groups, etc.

Hell, there's another set of posts in this very thread that was going down
the path of how good it was for the cleric to refuse to buff before getting
paid.

So learn the differences, and say "Do you really need the extra X hp for
this?"  Might get some surprising results.  I know I personally am too lazy
to go hunting down a buff when something close is available without moving.
