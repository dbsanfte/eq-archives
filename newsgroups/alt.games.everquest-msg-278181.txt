Heh. I walked into that one :) If you liked that, see /vender below :p

As long as the spells are scattered on different vendors it will never 
be that easy. Personally, I think it shouldn't be that easy.

It is a pretty funny visual though. =)

Fair enough. It would also be nice for food items to list their grade 
(miraculous, whistle wetter, etc and stats) or for the lists to be 
filterable/searchable so that I only see 'food & drink' or 'weapons and 
armour' or 'mage spell research items'... or 'cleric spells between 
level 24 and 29' etc etc etc

Or perhaps we should be able to pull up /vendor in any zone, see what 
all the NPCs are selling in a nice /bazaar interface window, right click 
on the item, click Find Vendor and follow the glowy over to him... 

Not sure that would be good for the 'game' though. But still...but it 
would make shopping "easier".

I mean there's lots of things we could fine tune to make it 'perfect' 
(each of us having their own list of preferences, but the OP gave it a 
thumbs down primarily because it didn't list spell level... 99% of my 
vendor purchases aren't for spells. Several classes in the game don't 
even use spells. And last but not least the -old- system didn't 
conveniently display spell levels either so its not like we lost 
something. 

It seems a very petty thing to trash the whole system over.
