And scientists shape what is considered "real" science by means of what they
choose to investigate.  It doesn't mean that only that which they decree is
"real" science, it just means that some valuable research is blackballed by
the scientific communit, so as to preserve their world-view.

Likewise, no one has proven the non-existance of a soul.

Ask many eastern healers, many of whom have achieved real, documented
results (in the JAMA, no less).  Just because we don't yet understand
something doesn't mean it doesn't exist, only that we have alot to learn.

If there is reason to believe that there is knowledge to be found there,
then sift, by all means.

I'd say NASA did a pretty good job of proving there is no turtle.  There
would have been a big collision in one of those space flights.  Also, can
you imagine the houses that would be crushed by it's shell?  We know about
forces, and about physical contact.  I think we've done a very nice job
disproving both the turtle, and Atlas.

Your "skeptics" do a good job at controlling the reins of science by writing
everyone who doesn't agree with them off as "loonies."  You guys ever think
of starting a church?

No, but if I was here 10,000 years ago, I would probably recall whether or
not the world was here with me.

Of course not.  I"m sorry, did I hurt the comfort of your atheist
world-view?

No, but carbon dating is the only form of measurment that doesn't have to
stand on a huge assumption.  We use the expansion of the universe as a
measure of dating the earth.  Problem is, that follows on the assumption
that the Big Bang theory is valid.  I've not seen any -proof- of that, only
estimates on how things -could- have happened.  Of course, your "skeptics"
take it for granted.  Carbon dating, OTOH only has to take as an assumption
that the atmosphere millions of years ago was similar to what we have today.
Not an unreasonable assumption, but an assumption, none the less... why
aren't you skeptical of it?

Again, it's possible.  Personally, I would look for another reason.

I admitt that I have no proof.  That's more than you "skeptics" are willing
to do.

Nope, it's just the scientists' turn on the hot plate.
