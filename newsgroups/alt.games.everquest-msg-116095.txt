Yeah, my brother bound his 60 cleric there.  He got stuck once, and wiggled
out...and left his bind spot the same.  So here I come logging him in to rez
my sorry ass, and I'm stuck there.  Since I knew he got out I did everything
I could think of to get him out, but the best I could manage was to fall
under the world.  I finally took my wizard there on my other computer and
TLed him to Nexus, brought him back to ME zone line, but bounded him safely.
My idiot brother complained because he was a few feet further from the zone
line. *sigh*  (err, he occasionally visits this newsgroup, lemme edit that
to "My poor misunderstood brother compl...")
