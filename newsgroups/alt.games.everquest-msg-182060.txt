    Depends how much of an upgrade and how much worse it looks. Took me a
long time to feel comfortable wearing a 20AC nodrop chain shirt I got in KC
over the 16AC "check out the non-twink" charred guardian BP I'd been wearing
since some warrior ran past me in east commons and gave it to me at lvl 10.

    But I'm sure I'd draw the line at pink. If someone gave my horribly evil
shadowknight a pink breasplate with 100ac I don't think I'd wear it until I
could dye it a proper colour for a knight of hatred and death to be wearing
:)
