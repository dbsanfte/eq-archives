I've solo-ed a Foul Pusling that was at zone while waiting for a raid
and ended up with 5% AA from it compared to Frogs in Storms which
I've recently had reliably conned at level 61 and always yield 7% AA
solo.

A lot of variables here: my UI could be inaccurate, PoS could have a
higher zem than CoD etc but unless either of these is the case I
don't think a mob one level higher is worth an extra 2%.
