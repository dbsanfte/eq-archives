Yes, this is a legitimate problem, during the 10 seconds or so around your zoning in,
mobs with no targets other than you may go for you and get to chew on you without any
hinderance.  I'm not sure why this is, seems to me you should be there or not... but
its sometimes the case. Its a genuine hazard.

Yes indeed, and the PoI exit is even worse, its really IN the zone out.  Graveyard is
a nice idea, but GY, zone in, and zone out all in same place, with bodies not
draggable away from GY.. well its setting people up for chain deaths.

Having a party there to watch you while you zone in, and keep the nasties off you and
heal you up fast, seems like a solution, perhaps even the solution they have in mind.
