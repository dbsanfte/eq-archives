<morten.x@NOSPAMfilm.dk> caused an exception C0000006H in module <We
Don't Want You To Know>:

>I get this error each time I close EQ, every since I upgraded to Windows XP.
>I camp and get to the character selection screen. When I press Quit (or
>Cancel) from that screen, I get a black screen.
>By pressing CTRL + ALT + DEL, I see that it's an error. Like this :

>EQMAIN.DLL error
>surface_lock : Blit failed
