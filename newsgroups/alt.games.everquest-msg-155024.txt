Ok imagine a mob hitting hard and fast for 700 a time..  you need somebody
to be taking those hits.. and everybody healing him in a chain

So your MA starts hitting it, builds some agro, everybody attacks.  Now the
mob just cast AE FD, who has agro?  Did the warriors agro memblur?  is a
cleric now on top of the agro list?  Another melee?   If they are, they will
be dead in a second or so

Its about agro control/management primarily..  but also something that kills
DPS every now and then.. designed, of course, to make the fight more
challenging
