You'll be sadly disappointed with Ever"quest" if you're looking for quests. 
The questing is buggy, unintuitive, often broken, and the rewards are worth
the effort in only about 1 out of every 10 quests, if that.

For community there is no bigger game than EQ, therefore there is no bigger
community than EQ.

EQ would actually be great to start as a newbie right now.  I'm a hardcore
EQ player, pushing 4 years now, and I have heard just enough about EQ2 to
know that I won't have any interest at all in it unless they make some major
changes to their design decisions before it's released.

Quake + IRC + mud.  But then you've played AC, so you have a fairly good
idea of the basic concept of the game.  What I think are the good and bad
points won't necessarily apply to you.  The joy of a game that can be played
with several unique approaches.
