Before thinking of how much easier YOUR life would be if you could bind
closer, think about how much more beneficial a non-SOWing, non-invising,
non-Root/snaring, char would find it?

In-game, binding is not a 'nature' skill, it's a 'brain' skill. Much
more realistically would be having tracking, all spells, and natural
regen/med being disabled in all indoor zones. That's just as likely to
happen. Rangers simply don't have anything to complain about, as they're
slightly ahead of the curve in terms of general class power at every
level of the game.
