Why are we attracted to beauty? Why do we feel a fundamental violation when
a theocratic fundamentalist state blows up two ancient icons of another
religion?

I postulate that, inside us all, is the whisper of Good, pointing our
hearts, minds, and civilizations towards something greater than we have
today. That, then, is evidence of "counter-evil" and suggests that Good and
Evil are spiritual, not rational concepts -- and that they are
transcultural, not state defined. And that logic itself cannot define Evil
or Good.

As for the Darwinians, let us consider that the shark is a magnificently
successful predator, one whose species has outlived mankind tenfold. The
shark is superior in the ranks of survival, but in one important way, it is
a dead species. Nothing has changed in shark life for millions of years.
Sharks are excellent sharks but they Are Not Going Anywhere. Mankind, for
all his foibles, seems to be going somewhere, and that fact that we have not
all killed and eaten each other is due mostly to the whispers we hear, from
our DNA, our gods, or whatever, that tell us what is Good and what is Evil.
