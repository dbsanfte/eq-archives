Heart of Fungus, and it's melee/hybrid  class only, and the effect is
Chloroplast, 10hp/tick as opposed to 15/tick with fungi (of course the heart
has 10% to bind wounds too), heart is fairly much a downtime thing with
negative 50 ac, 25 sv disease/poison, and taking up your primary hand,
whereas Fungi tunics you can wear 24/7 unless swapping out for saves or a
click (whee, want RoTG bp sirs)
