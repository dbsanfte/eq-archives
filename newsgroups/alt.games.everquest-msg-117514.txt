As a ranger....I can track a group member's corpse as long as I the ranger stay
in the zone.  It doesn't matter where the dead player is.

I see SoAndSo's corpse on my track list. No spell is needed. Not sure about
Druids but i would think it would be the same as Rangers with corpse tracking.

Hope that helps.
