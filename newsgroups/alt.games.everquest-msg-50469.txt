No. At that point its not worth selling them to players; the hassle is
too great. In fact, you end up with the situation now seen where droppable
uber items are being given to mort and gage in thurgadin, the bankers, as
gifts to hold because the high level game players can't be bothered to sell,
see no point in selling and, debatably, want to maintain a stranglehold on
the endgame power such items provide access to.
