One other place this works better than others is in LDON. (Ignoring people
doing a specific camp for a adventure point item)
Since you really don't have any idea what item will drop, at least here
agreeing to it before entry does allow for a little better distribution. (MM
has weapons, shields, armor pieces etc). You still aren't handling the guy
who is woefully underequipped, but you are evening out the curve some.
That said when leading a group I always say it is random, opt out if you
like, but don't expect it of everyone.
For people that were mentioning augs, I usualy do stat vs. resist augs as
two different rolls and two different groups for the "you can only win one
item from a specific group (augs, named drops, resist augs) until everyone
has one from that group"
