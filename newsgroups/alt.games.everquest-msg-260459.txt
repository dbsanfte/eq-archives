I believe they were not supposed to stack, but, they do.  You can place 
one of each shaman dot on the same mob from each shaman who is casting.  
One shaman can stack:

Sicken - level 5
Tainted Breath - level 9
Affliction - level 19
Envenomed Breath - level 24
Scourge - level 34
Shock of the Tainted - level 34
Envenomed Bolt - level 49
Plague - level 49
Bane of Nife - level 56
Pox of Bertoxxulous - level 59
Breath of Ultor - level 63? 64? (somewhere in there)
Blood of Saryrn - level 65
Epic DoT
Bane - Don't recall the level
plus whatever the lower level curse based LDoN DoTs are.

This is assuming a shaman could actually cast all those before they start 
wearing off, which, he can't.  I've had 5 DoTs going simultaneously on 
one mob before I ever had Bane, or the PoP DoTs, one was epic, two 
disease, and two poison.
