Where can a 20th ranger try to work on getting a container that reduces
weight?

How does augmentation work?  [If a 5,000 word explanation is too much to ask
maybe somebody has a good website to recommend]

The slot types in weapons and armor - who do I have to ... uh ... talk to
and pay lots of money to get them filled, preferably with STR raising
gizmos?

Where is a good spot to solo for a 20 Ranger?

What is the meaning of life?

PS:  Last question will be answered later in this thread so stay tuned...
Same sylvan bat-time, same sylvan bat-channel...

PSS:  Ignore this at will - far too little sleep and just throwing out what
ever random weirdness has been lurking behind my now failing mental filters.
