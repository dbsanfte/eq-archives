Xp personal OeM version here. works great. 128 MB ram and an AMD 450. 64 mb
vid card. XP set to best performence mode. classic start menu etc..
MUCH! more stable then ME or 98.
Faster zone times (like cut in half!)
alittle odd though is i keep running out of virtual memory when running more
then 4 things at once.. dunno how come i have 4gb of free space for it to
use. to take advantage of all win xp's pretty little features i would
recommend 256 ram.
The little firewall thing it has doesnt interfere with eq at all.. and it
fixed a control panel glitch that i happend when i put eq on with win me
best $200 i almost spent
(company i work for orderd a bunch of Oem personal edition xp cd's and got 5
more then they asked/payed for so 5 employess got free copies =) )
