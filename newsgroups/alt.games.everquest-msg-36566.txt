The "official" word is that the higher of wis/int determines skill increases
while success is strictly based on skill vs trivial level. S upposedly in
smithing, STR also affects skill increases.  I've smithed with a character
of an INT of 75 and another character with INT at 196 and noticed no
reasonable advantage.

See above.

I have a brewing skill of 200 and I've been making tempers since 140 and
never failed once on over 100 or so tempers.  It seems that the higher in
skill you go, the less you fail on late and non-trivial items.
