Yep.

No, it won't. ;)

Instead of seeing a cleric run low on mana, eat three or four
rods, and go back into the fight, you'll see the cleric use
the mana the rod replaces, use his 'pre-fight' rod, use some
more mana, get another rod directly from a mage, use that rod
when the 'buff' icon wears off, and so on.

Instead of just standing somewhere and dropping rods as fast
as they can, now they'll get to stand somewhere and reply to
"/tell mage00 ready for mod rod" with "/rt; /ttell inc mod rod;
/cast 1."

And now the wipeout will be because the mages missed giving
mod rods efficiently to the clerics instead of because the
clerics messed up.  Overall, not a good change, IMO, and it's
certainly not going to change a mage's primary raid role.  If
anything, it'll mean more mages are needed for mod rod duty.
