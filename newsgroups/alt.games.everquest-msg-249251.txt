Nobody cared because pretty much nobody needed to go there. That's a 
design flaw.

If the bartenders handed out connects to ldon missions for example 
instead of the wayfarerer camps where do you think people would be? The 
cities.

If pok was just a travel hub & great library then where would people go 
to bank and re-supply and purchase TS components? The cities.

If the bazaar didn't exist as one ultra-zone, but was rather scattered 
about amongst a few major cities with room for 150 traders in each where 
would people go to shop? The cities.

I'd even have the hubs that become popular tax sales on the order of 
20-30%... and the smaller out of the way ones tax sales on the order of 
0-5%... just for kicks and to see how the players dealt with it. The 
more people in /trader the higher the taxes. It would be interesting to 
see how the market evolved. Would some cities fill out despite the high 
taxes because it was easier to 'sell there' or would the player base 
distribute evenly to maximize profits. Could even be some RP oppotunity 
in there for those inclined. :)
