I've used several brokers and haven't had any problems. I don't have a
vendor set up so I can't comment there, but obviously others have so I
still don't see it as a problem (bugged? possibly).

Of course I'm not sure. I don't work for the developers in any way so I
can't definitively say for sure one way or the other. When I say it won't
happen I mean it won't happen for me (Just to clarify it, I wasn't clear in
my original statement). Because if it does my account gets canceled
immediately.
