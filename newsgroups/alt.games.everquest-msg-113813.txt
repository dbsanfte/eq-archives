Patch message seems to indicate that you can now make your default chat
channel one of the new custom channels.

BTW, unless they fixed it with today's patch, if you typed /channel and hit
enter you'd get the little help file.  Part of that help says, "(e.g.
/channel Shat mychannel)."

I couldn't get the damned thing to work.  Let's say I autologin to a channel
CALLED "mychannel" with the password of "mypassword."  I'm assuming that a
PW isn't needed, but I wanted to cover the bases.  What would I type to get
"mychannel" as my default chat?

Based on the "shat" example I think I'd type "/channel chat mychannel" but
I'm pretty sure I tried both that AND "shat." :)

("shat" is a past tense and a past participle of "shit")
