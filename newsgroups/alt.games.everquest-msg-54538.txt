Just like they "gave in" to players wanting to turn off inspection messages,
the ability to inspect others, the players wanting to change their surname,
Etc. Times are changing and so will Verant if they want to maximize customer
retention.

I suppose everyone should just not complain about anything they think is
wrong and play the game as is no matter how broken quests are. No matter how
many items are not dropping. No matter what you feel is not wrong or could
make the game better. What difference does it make to me that some other
player's class has a problem. It has nothing to do with me so if they
complain about it they are obviously whining. That is your logic. For some
thing that is in the "minority" as you claim there sure are lot of players
that feel they same way. The minority is always players that are more vocal
than others on any subject but that is just life. I still fail to see why
others resort to name calling and placing tags on others for voicing their
opinion just because they disagree or even worse have no opinion on the
matter. You have already stated that there is no right side or wrong side to
this and no legitimate reason it to be allowed on either side but yet any
one that asks for the change is a whiny, neurotic and not worth Verant's
time. Him sounds like every one that has ever sent in a bug or feedback form
to me. =)
