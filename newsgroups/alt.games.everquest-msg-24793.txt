Yep, I got that... We had a discussion about it in Guk about 5 minutes 
after the servers went up.  (Does being online within five minutes of the 
servers going up make me a sad, sad, case?  I fear so...)  It sounds like 
it changed for some people but not others.  I suspect it's either (a) 
something that is now set as a user-defined color in the init file, or (b) 
somehow associated with what video card we have.

I've got a Voodoo3 AGP.  You?
