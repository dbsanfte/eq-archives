we currently in OT and She wants to quad kite with me... neither of us have
done before so was wondering where I could get some good info on locations,
tactics, do's/don'ts etc... Have seen bits and pieces on quad kitting but
have never done/attempted it before as I am an enchanter... thanks for any
info, tips, tricks location suggestions etc etc ad nauseum
