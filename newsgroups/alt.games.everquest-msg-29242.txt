Also at 44, you get Retribution, which again puts you up
high in the ranks of nukers... if you can and should be
nuking.  I've happily solo'd any number of mobs using
this little number, and when you are a solo cleric, healing
is the least used of your abilities.

Root (later, immobilize)
Celestial Healing
Greater Healing (later, Remedy)
Stun
Force (later, Sound of Force)
Retribution
Gate
Divine Aura

Keep SOW (from a bottle) or JBoot/TBoot on at all
times, don't let the mobs hit you much, run till you are
beyond root range, then mash the root button till it
casts, if it doesn't stick run to get range again.  When it
does stick, run out to max range for retribution and
nuke till it breaks, then scoot and repeat the root.

Stun to get stuff off you  or buy time if you need to
double back past a mob due to tight geography,
Force if the mob is almost dead and you don't need
the full fury (and mana cost) of retribution, Gheal
if you have been getting tagged somehow and need
a little HP boost to be comfortable, Celestial for
after the fight if you got tagged a lot.  Gate in case
mana runs out and the fight is still there, DA in case
you somehow get a gang of stuff mad at you and
need to run to zone.

With a snaring partner I'll drop gate and put in Fear.
