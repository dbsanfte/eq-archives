	That is not true.  The Abrahamic deity is billed by all three faiths as
omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.  Says so right here on the label,
and apologists for all three have been wrestling with the implications for
centuries now.

	That is not my problem -- he ain't my god.

	That does not buy you anything.  The result is still just an alien being
with a bigger bag of tricks than what we gots.

	Q can be improved by fine-tuning his attitude, but the result is still
just a flashy alien.

	No, it isn't.  What if an "evil" act were logically necessary for a
greater good in the future?  (N.B. this is a standard reply to the problem of
evil.)  The only way that an act could warrant *infinite* punishment would be
if that act were absolutely evil, I.E., it had no good consequences
whatsoever.  And the only way to know that is to have unerring knowledge of
the future.
