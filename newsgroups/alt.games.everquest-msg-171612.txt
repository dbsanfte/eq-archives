Alts?  Who has time for alts?  =)  I have a Beastlord alt that has gathered
dust since I joined this guild - between the nightly raids and my personal
quest to get smithing up, I simply don't have time for it.  A shame, really,
because I *love* playing him.  It's great to be able to effectively get XP
all on my own, without having to worry about groupmates.  (A few times when
I grouped my Beastlords with others, I found that it made my skin itch to
see my groupmates' health fall.  I felt as if I should be doing something.
Healing instincts die hard.)

As for the trash that drops, we mostly let it rot.  No one needs it and no
one much feels like bothering to sell it.  Whoever wants to loot it gets it.

Don't I wish.  =)  Lucy's lists a "Summon Peridots" spell; I wish there was
an item that actually had that effect.  I'm guessing that's for CS folks.
Or maybe it's for a yet-to-be-discovered item in the Plane of Time or
something.  I'd like that.

I've heard Inner Acrylia isn't worth the time sink it takes to get there.
Sanctus Seru also seems a failure, in that it doesn't get the same level of
raiding that, say, Kael gets.  I sometimes wonder if Verant failed in some
of these zone designs or we, as a player base, tend to gravitate towards the
simple and easy and therefore ignore what could be some nice content.

My guild did Restless Burrower once while I was at work.  I followed the
raid on EQIM and looked up the loot that dropped.  My jaw fell to my knees.
That's amazing loot for how easy the mob is to kill.  No wonder its life
expectancy can be measured in minutes.

Ouch.

I'm in need of an infusion myself.  I'm down to 10K and I feel dirt poor.  I
did some Heraldic combines and found that, at 243, I have a pretty good
success rate.  So I'm just beginning to take some orders.  I need to make at
least one quick sale so I can afford more blue diamonds et. al.

> What do you skill up on nowadays, sickles?

I don't have access to a cleric of Tunare.  I once asked a Tunarian cleric
in our guild, "What would you say if I asked you to imbue 500 emeralds?"  He
responded, "I would be quite likely to say 'no'."  Couldn't argue with that.
=)

I've been doing Shadowscream.  I found a way to manipulate the Hollowshade
Moor war to help me farm the no-drop items.  Only *after* the nerf did I
find out about Ethereal Rings, but I was at least able to use them to go
from 194 to 212 relatively quickly.

I spent 30 hours there before I got mine.  Last night I grouped with a
guildie who said they'd spent 50 hours there.  Right at the very end, when I
had to say, "I'll stay for one more round, then I have to get to bed so I
can get up in time for work," a prophet popped.  My guildie was very
nervous - "Does this guy drop a shard?  Are you sure?" - and when we killed
it, I saw him kneel over the corpse and then say "OMG!"  He looted his shard
and was ecstatic.

It's simply amazing that as many people manage this drop as they do.  I
can't help but wonder what harm it would do to up the spawn rate on these
guys.  As I understand it, they put in this time sink because Vex Thal
wasn't ready, and Verant needed more time to populate it with mobs and loot.
Now that they've finished, they should scale back the time sink a bit, I
think.  It really is ludicrous to put their players through this.  I have
hope; they eventually saw the light and changed Ragefire.  Maybe they'll
revisit this as well.

Heh, good point.  =)

Yeah, I know.  I was too cocky.  I used to DA past the guards to the
entrance of Chardok back in the day.  But I'm uber now, so I don't need to
worry about guardian mobs any more, do I?

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....

OK, lesson in humility learned.  Will DA in the future.  =)

Good idea.  One thing about PoP is that I now feel perfectly at ease binding
anywhere - all I need to do to get back to the PoK is use my Faithstone of
Life to get to Qeynos and use the book there.

I remember when travel was a pain.  I remember when I was jealous of my
friend who was a cleric of Mithaniel Marr, so his faithstone took him to
North Freeport, the trading center of the world.  The Nexus and the PoK
changed that.  For the better, I think.  I'm not one of those people who
like to say, "Back in my day, if I had to get from Qeynos to Kunark, I ran
across these insanely large zones to Freeport, waited for a boat for half an
hour and rode it for fourty-five more minutes, and I *liked* it!"  The fact
that I had to do things the hard way doesn't mean I begrudge those who can
do it much more easily these days.  =)

I've subsequently done some research, and the inner architecture does indeed
look impressive.  It will look even more impressive rendered on my monitor.

Thanks, James.  =)  I appreciate the commentary, as always.
