Waite wasn't keen on fortune-tellers, and I don't
think he would have been too impressed by Life of

Then learn why Waite made it yellow, instead of
say, pale blue.

In Tarot, symbolism is just about everything.

I don't discount it. I don't particularly care for
the GD deck, I find the artwork a little stark,
though the symbolism is particularly rich.

Aesthetics, though, should come a poor second to
content.

There is an alchemical deck around, which I may
purchase, mainly because of the pretty pictures,
but also because of the GD correspondences with
alchemy.

Not so much divine inspiration, but a reason,
whereas Mary just thought it might look nicer that
way.

A bit like covering an antique table with
polyurethane varnish.

I don't generally disparage any decks (well..
maybe the baseball one!), but I'm fairly
traditional and stick with Thoth and Rider-Waite.
This is probably because there is so much
literature and documentation about them, that
comes from the history of occult Tarot, and even
before that.

With some of the post-modern decks, you get the
little white booklet, and then you are left to
fend for yourself with guesswork and assumptions.
