See this is a case in favor of PLing or EBaying.  A couple
months, sure, but a couple years, no way.  If a friend of mine
joined the game primarily to play grouped with me, I'd either PL
him up or make an alt thats his level and switch.  Probably both.

This doesn't mean I'd kill the whole experience for him, I'd
leave him alone or use the alt for large chunks of that time so
he'd get some play time in the lower levels to figure things out
or just to enjoy some of the lower level stuff thats out there...
but if we PL'd 5 levels once a week he'd be 35 in 7 weeks and
able to group with anyone in the game (since 50 was the cap)

Perhaps I'm just too impatient
