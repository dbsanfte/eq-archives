The eye twitching is more than likely related to eye strain.  I wear
contacts and use to have the same thing happen to me after long hours in
front of the computer.  Last year I bought myself a 19 inch Viewsonic
Professional series monitor that I can run at 1280 by 1024 at 85 hertz.  I
also now have a tv set to my right about 5 feet away so I can look away from
the monitor and at tv ever so often.  Since I have changed to this setup,
the eye twitching has not come back.  If you spend hours infront of the
computer then spend the extra cash and get the best monitor that you can
get.  It will make a HUGE difference in the long run.
