First off if someone is Annoying via Ooc, Shouts, or Tells. I put them on my
Ignore list. This sends them a message saying they have been added to your
Ignore list, 2 it filters out any Says, Auc, Ooc, Shouts, and Tells so they
could be begging for their lives next to you and you would never hear a
thing. I have had one guy log on his second character or have a friend send
me a tell why did you put me "XXXX" on Ignore I have a high level Druid see
if I ever port you anywhere. As if I was suppose to care.
