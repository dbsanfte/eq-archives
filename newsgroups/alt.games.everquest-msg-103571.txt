Ah, I see where our points of view differs. I think your view is perfectly
correct if you look at the game realistically speaking, whereas I think mine
proberly only have vailidity only in the theoretical "as per designed"
sense.

Still, I would loath to think of a game system where the difficulty rating
is based on the twinked/experienced player. I for one with my acute lack of
dexterity would not get far past level one no matter how much game
experience I clocked up : )
