Heh, yea, it's like the trolls who have their control newsgroups that they 
use to keep score when they leave bait, their mark of distinction where 
fellow trolls can see all the replies they've stimulated. Having a stalker 
has its own kind of hierarchy. First level is the guy who just flames you 
consistently. Been there, done that. Second level is having a guy who 
watches for your every post and leaves a response every time, often using 
contorted justifications to make it sound like he's got a *reason* to reply, 
except it's obvious to everyone else that there's a major inferiority 
resentment going on that he just can't let go of. Been there, too. Then you 
get to the next level and some guy starts to mimic your language and using 
your own phrases. Reg was this guy in all the CoH threads. We'd get to a 
certain point and I'd call him out for his utter lack of indivduality and 
identity, a pathetic follower and sycophant unable even to come up with a 
good sentence on his own, reduced to using some of my own language in his 
replies, and then he would repeat his same tired old line about the 3 story 
office buildings and then disappear, obviously licking his wounds.

The *next* step in the hierarchy -- and this is really getting into to the 
upper echelons now -- is having someone who is so racked by personal 
insecurity, so utterly devoid of any self esteem or self identity, that he 
begins to impersonate you on the newsgroups, pretending to be you in order 
to have the rare and precious opportunity to be something other than 
himself. Thanks to the unfortunate Reggie, I've just entered that rare 
pantheon of stalkees that is distinguished by having its own ghost, 
shadowing them around everywhere they go. Must truly suck to be him, eh? ;-)
