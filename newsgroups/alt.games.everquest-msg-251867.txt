I used AR's site and found you are exactly right.  The royal attendant stuff is
great stuff, I'm not even seeing it because I don't have enough points yet.  
I'm just hoping by the time I acquire that many points - 1492 - that the
equipment is still an upgrade.  Thats approximately 25 more LDONs...
I'd love to have the 510 point FT2 augment thats ONLY good for a chest item
that requires 1000 more points than the aug itself.... sigh...
