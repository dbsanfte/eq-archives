    You must be reading a different document from me. Where in that listing 
is "cost" mentioned? Is this something you're assuming, or something you 
know? Personally, I hope there is no cost associated for a very selfish 
reason. Back in the old days, the guild decided we didn't want alts in the 
main guild. So we created a guild just for our alts - Lotus Buds (the main 
guild is Lotus Cult). Over time, given our reversal of the original policy, 
that guild has shrunk to 27 or so members. Of those members, seven of them 
are my altss, and they comprise seven of the eight most active members of 
the guild (most of the other members belong to cancelled accounts). I'd 
essentially be getting a private clubhouse for my twinks. :-)

    The potion belt has been requested by clerics, wizards, and various 
others for quite some time. I'm interested to see if the belt will be done 
as a physical location which items are placed in, or as a special hotkey 
bank which player-chosen inventory slots are associated with. No more 
swapping in the epic 1.0, and the epic 1.5 would be worth doing for someone 
like myself with a near-equivalent shield (Aegis of Blackscales).

    This is disturbing news. Right now, EQ1 gets this service for free when 
free zones are offered like The Hole and Temple of Solusek Ro. Under this 
model, we'd be paying for every set of additional zones they wish to create, 
and with no guarantee that everyone would have a given set of zones the 
player base would fragment more than it already has. I do like the online 
aspect, and that it would likely smooth out the release rate of new content, 
but I have the sneaking suspicion that when you add it all up you'd pay more 
for X zones worth of Adventure Packs than you would for an X zone expansion.
