On the other hand, if you give them a tell and say "I'm forming a group to go
jump off the ledge into the Hole," most people will join.  Perhaps Sheep isn't
the word after all, Lemmings come to mind.

People do not want to lead.

Heck, I don't want to lead, and I know how easy it is to get people to
follow.  But I spend my half my RL life bossing around 35 employees, and I'd
rather follow, its more pleasant for me.  Baaaa.   (or whatever noise it is
Lemmings make)
