A friend tried to quest plate arms at the weekend (warrior) and the
gems/arms were eaten...  right npc, right gems etc, yet the npc told him to
take a hike.

Another friend tried to multi quest plate gaunts the other day (to a cleric)
and the gems/gaunts were eaten... right npc, right gems, yet the npc told
him to take a hike.

The first is still awaiting his (escelated) petition to be replied to... the
second is shit out of luck because it was a MQ

I have farmed SS lately, and amongst other items have a SS chain BP and legs
I want to MQ....

Firstly has anybody successfully quested rogue armour lately?  And if so,
which pieces?

And secondly, has anybody heard anything to explain the first 2 errors?
Faction was definately not the issue.

N.b- monk arms, cleric legs and cleric arms were all successfully quested in
SS the past weekend..
