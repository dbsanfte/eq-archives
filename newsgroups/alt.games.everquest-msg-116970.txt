As stated in the subject, I would like to start a character on Friona
Vrie and since I intend it to be the role playing character I have
always attempted but never quiet held myself too on the Nameless, I
would like to be something a bit rare to add to my feeling of
roleplaying.

I am thinking rare classwise, not so much race/class combo.  So my
question is obviously, and I know I saw this before, what seems to be
the rarest classes in FV.  

Difficulty is not a concern, I'd rather be a struggling rarity than an
indistinguishable success.

Thanks for your opinions and I know I probably spelled FV wrong.


Unborn on Frionna
over-cloned on Nameless
