1. Is the factory installed VC built into the Motherboard? If they
answer is "Yes" then you need to find out whether or not the system
board has an AGP slot. If the MB does not have an AGP slot your choice
in VCs will be limited. You will only be able to use a PCI video card.

I recommend the following cards in your price range.....

1. Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS 32mb DDR (*there are several manufacturers
using Nvidia chips)
2. Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS MX 32mb DDR (a stripped down version of the
original GTS, but still a very decent card)
3. ATI Radeon 32mb DDR LE (Can be found on the net for @75.00USD. It
offers fanatastic image quality and performance in EQ. I am running
one myself)

*Look for Nvidia chip based cards made by Leadtek, Vision Tek,
Gainword, Elsa, and Hercules/Guillemot
