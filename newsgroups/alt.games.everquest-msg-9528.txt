   I do agree that inviting somebody to shoot them self is wrong but lets
see it in the light is was written and not the so literal way.  It was no
more then a statement of buzz off.  Anyone taking it more then that should
question the reality of it.  Also me and the other person's party were the
only ones in the zone.  Their group was already aware of me so OOC was just
the way of communiquï¿½ between the sole two groups in the zone.

   Lets also consider this was a first offense of this so called nature.   I
had used ooc and cursed at one time and was suspended for it but it was over
a year ago.  I am not what the law would consider a, habitual offender, I
did it once and that was the last time.  This time, I did not use profanity
and was not aware what I was saying would be considered a threat or I would
have just said, shout up or blow your head off, but that was not my
intentions.  My intention was to just say to them to chill out.

  I honestly believe that GM Rhuyai is the product of somebody's pocket
book.  many other people have petitioned about things and they go
unanswered.  This is bias and a show of something awry.  You might question
how or why I know that he doesn't answer some petitions.  I have family
members and friends who play this game and I have watched them play and
witnessed the accounts.  Nearly a few moments after I was banned a player
said to a friend of mine -  playing in the room with me - that she would
kill him if he looked around the area again.  The petition was never
answered.   Yes I agree that I am a poor witness for the fact that I am
Banned.  ka sera sera, Is it?

  the big question is, is the Eula fair?  A class action law suit would help
to forge a law that would out law Eulas that are un fair to the purchaser
and general decent player of games.  It takes many people however so if you
know anyone that is willing to fight this with me you might send them my way
and I will put them in contact with my Attorney.  Some things that might be
considered are, false advertising, damage to machines do to the hardware
requirements on the box being too low, and several other issues.   (Try a
surface scan on you hard drive if you have less then 120MB of ram and you
will probably find bad sectors if you have played for any length of time.)

  Addressing profanity with in the game,  I totally agree that profanity
shouldn't a banable offense for that fact that it removes a great deal of
words that present a greater emotion or emotions that are swirling out of
control.  It is a tool used use in common writings of today and popular
media.  it's part of who we are as a society.  To deny it and try to remove
it from the world is only suppressing mankind.  For over 2000 years the word
f*c* has been part of our society(fact look it up) yet not till recently was
it admitted to the dictionary.  They are just words and part of our
expressions and language for the past 2000 years.   I have to use asterisks
on it because people have it blocked in their news browsers and would not
read this message because of it.  It reminds me of the old adage, tossing
out the baby with the bath water.  Enough said for now.

 I'll be around: Anthony
