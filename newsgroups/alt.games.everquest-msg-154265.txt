bp: fungi
bracers: 2 x BoB
head: crown of king tranix
legs: hmm
arms: hmm
feet: hmm

And even those items..  fungi isn't exactly on offer to any 50 monk.  Bracer
of Benevolence was camped by uber guilds for a long long time, so whilst an
easy quest, getting the scout wasnt easy.
Tranix crown.. I never got one in my leveling days, not mad rare but not
common either, and more than I could have afforded

Please ask your monks.. because I'd love to know what they had which was
better than ToV armour, before they were ToV capable

Go read verants quote in the nerf monk statement again, that bs line about
being effective with or without gear

Monks can't do jack shit naked, they are as heavily reliant on gear as any
other class
