All of the Warriors and Rangers as well as two of the Paladins I've
played have made themselves a bow and arrows as soon as they had
about 5pp to their names.  Usually put a few points into fletching
(as in 3 or 4) and started making the cheapo arrows (trivial at 16,
so better than 50% success even at ZERO skill), then make a cheapo
bow (also trivials at 16).  I was able to do this by level 4 or 5
even in the "bad old days" (well, except for Kaev who was still
on the verge of starvation at L4 and didn't learn about fletching
until L6, whereupon he immediately spent his tiny stash of cash to
make arrows and a bow). Anyhow, I don't know if 5pp is "a lot more
money than [you had]", but it sure seemed cheap and worthwhile to me.
