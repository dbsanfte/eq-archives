Check the IP addresses assigned to the NIC (use ipconfig). Make sure the NIC
does not use an IP address starting with 192.168.#.#, these addreses are
used by Windows for local Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) and won't route
to the outside. If you are using this machine as an ICS server, then it will
have 2 NIC's, one with a 192.168.0.1 address (connected to the other
machines locally) and one to talk to the cable modem - this one should get
address from cable modem, but sometimes they don't and you need to assign
one manualy. Your cable modem documents should give you an idea of how to
configure the NIC (i.e. what IP address to use) - or you may need to re-run
an install program.
