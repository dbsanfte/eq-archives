You'll still see level-differences, causing resists, etc.  The items
make casters more efficient and could (will, I guess) mean
there's a chance that some who were able to kill something
if they just had more mana will now be able to, but I don't see
where it's going to "break" anything.   It's going to amount to
always giving casters clarity, for a simple analogy.   You won't
regen mana faster, but your mana will do more.  Pretty much
the same thing, except for clerics using CHeal (which isn't
affected by any of the items, of course.)

So, if you could solo a sand giant at level 31 with Clarity, go for
it.  If you couldn't, I wouldn't suggest it.   (And Clarity with focus
items is just another boost, like C2 instead of C1, or KEI instead
of C2, etc etc etc.   The real boost is going to be in group
performance on raids where the extra damage is going to make
a major difference.)
