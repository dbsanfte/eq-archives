    Not likely. In general, pre-50 you're better off getting a number of
small improvements over one big one. Also consider that in the areas you'll
be camping soon at your level, you're most likely to see a good weapon drop
as opposed to good armour.

    That's what I would do, yeah.

    I'll make some suggestions there, too. ;-)

>Mostly crafted armor (except)

    Look into Gauntlets of the Black for hands - AC 15 STR 4 WIS 3, should
be sub-1 K.

>Blood Stained Mantle

    Keep this for resist gear, find either a Crafted Pauldron or a Tattered
Mantle. Tattered preferred, again will come pretty cheap or could be hunted
in a group.

>Belt is some sort of spun cloth belt (?) have to check that.

    Straw-Spun Belt is pretty solid. If you have the cash, for 1 K or less
you can pick up a Spider Fur Belt: no weight, AC 10 DEX 5 AGI 5 HP 40.

>Frost Giant Beard

    The gnolls in Iceclad have a quest for an AC 6 AGI 2 DEX 2 HP 10 No Drop
mask - look into it. Barring that, Fine Plate is AC 7.

>Two Jagged Bands

    These must go. Now. Velium Fire Wedding Rings - AC 6 HP 65. Contact your
local jeweler - looking at about 1 K or so for a pair.

    Some resist gear that's got some bang for the buck - Crown of the
Froglok Kings, obviously. Usually 1 K or less, at your level you could camp
it with your group (they drop often, and likely your friends want them too).
Runed Bone Fork - 10 MR CR FR, found in Upper Guk, at your level you could
camp several things in Upper Guk at once (assuming people aren't there, they
usually aren't) and make some minor cash. Goes in the ranged slot. Last
thing, Cloak of the Ice bear, AC 8 HP 10 CR 20, usually around 100 pp in EC.

    Speaking of the Cloak, you don't mention your hidden slots. I can guess
what earrings you have, so....

Cloak: the aformentioned CotIB, or Fine Steel (AC 10), or a Spider Fur Cloak
(weightless AC 10 STR 4 STA 4 CR 6). Spider Fur is in the 1 K range.
Neck: Ulthork Collar (AC 7 HP 30), Spider Fur Collar (AC 10 STR 7 PR 7 CR
7), Ry'Gorr Collar (AC 9 STA 4 MR 4). All good stuff, Spider Fur is most
expensive at around 1500 pp. Personally, at your level I'd look into Ry'Gorr
first.

    If you want better weapons, a few cheap ones come to mind. Cane of the
Tranquil is an 11/24 1HB, should get it for under 1 K. Velium Short Blade is
10/24 1HS 5 CR 5 MR procs Velium Shards, again, should cost 1 K. Crystalline
Spider Fang is 10/22 piercer with 3 STR 10 PR and procs Velium Shards.
That'll run you in the 2 K range, and remember: piercing caps lower for a
warrior than all other weapon skills. Also at 2 K is the Jarsath Trident, an
11/22 5 STR 5 STA -5 DEX -5 AGI piercer, same issue. So if you have 7 K or
so, the shopping list I'd recommend would be:

Gauntlets of the Black, Spider Fur Belt, 2 Velium Fire Wedding Rings,
Ry'Gorr Collar, Cloak of the Ice Bear, Cane of the Tranquil, Velium Short
Blade, Tattered Mantle. Go quest/camp the Iceclad mask, a Runed Bone Fork,
and a Crown of the Froglok Kings.

    If you want to save more cash, first item I'd cut would be the
Gauntlets. At your level you'll soon be in Karnor's, and the first named
camp by the zone (Captain) drops your Cobalt Gauntlets, a superlative weapon
(Jade Mace 9/18), and a piece of FR gear (Drolvarg Mantle) - so you'll
likely end up there. Your next purchase will likely be a haste item - save
for it. Also note that you'll be able to recover SOME cash you spend by
selling the item it replaces.

    No. Again, going to two solid 24-delay weapons should be sufficient. And
the AC/HP/resist improvements will make you much better once you have taunt.
