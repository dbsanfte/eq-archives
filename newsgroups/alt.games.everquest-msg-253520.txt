I am a 55 Pally and want to start a few AA's.  Here are a few questions:

1) I heard that if you split XP between level and AA you actually loose
some.  Is this true?  How much do you loose?
2) What AA's should I get?  I plan to do Run1,2,3 then Sta1,2,3 then go all
the way to 60 before doing any more.  Is this fine?
3) If you have 1 AA in run (run1) you are slower than SOW, and however
cannot use any SOW potions to boost speed.  Is this true?

Thanks for the help.

Arnaz, Solusek Ro.
