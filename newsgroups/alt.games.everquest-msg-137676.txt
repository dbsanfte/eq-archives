}Well if we are talking about using predisposition as an excuse then I
}agree, I don't like that.  I do like the idea of people recognizing
}their own predispositions so they are better prepared to actively use
}their free will to overcome the things which they choose.  This seems to
}imply an actual higher level of self responsibility since you have no
}excuse, you already know you are predisposed so you dang well better be
}able to use your will to overcome them.

Hmm, I do like that idea.  I wonder if anyone's ever done a study of which 
route is more frequently taken?  That would be a hard one to set up, 
though.  But some of those sociologists are pretty darn tricky. :)

}I have a predisposition to
}chemical dependence, known that since I was a wee boy and drank my first
}shot and smoked my first joint.  I made a conscious choice to stay the
}hell away from heroin based on that knowledge hehe and it has served me
}well in life, but if I hadn't then the blame would fall squarely on
}myself, not on my predispositions.

Good job. :) I haven't really determined if I have such a predisposition 
or not, so I'll just have to rely on will alone to keep me away from 
stupid drugs.  It helps that most of them just don't sound like much fun 
to me, though. :)

}I know you are probably speaking of
}"genetic predispositions" but I don't make that distinction.  I don't
}know if there are physical (genetic) reasons behind my own personal
}tendencies or if they are all psychological in nature and it doesn't
}matter to me, all that matters is that I see the pattern and act to
}avoid repeating it if that is my choice.  You are quite right that many
}would simply use such information as an excuse after the fact though as
}opposed to using it to drive free will to overcome their urges.

I think it's that if there's sufficient evidence that it's genetic, more 
people will interpret it as non-overcomeable.  As you point out, that's 
not a very good assumption, but enough people make it for it to be 
relevant.

}Nope, one spine,  one heart, one soul, just two extremely diverse
}minds.  Unfortunately they both are prone to extremes and so either can
}lead me astray at any time.  The key I find is to let them both have
}full control and to some extent they cancel each other out <G>.  Still,
}if offered sanity as a replacement for that which I've known my whole
}life I don't know that I would accept.  It just seems so boring from my
}perspective, but I only know it from what I see so maybe sanity is nice
}too <G>.

Bah, sanity is overrated.  Follow your bliss. :)  I have this horrid 
genetic predispostion for sanity, it's been a bitch overcoming it. :)
