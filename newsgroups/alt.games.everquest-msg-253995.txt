Accusations I don't see, considering all those thing are more
expensive than paying Tax. Many companies can't hide profits because
they have to be US corporations to do certain types of work.

Reference from a primary source for this please? If you include zero
income corporations, with zero gross income I can believe it. For
actual companies, this is patently false. Every corporation that has
one employee, had to pay FICA. That is a tax.

Most statements like this are highly prefaced.
