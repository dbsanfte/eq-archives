Huh?

You can get to gunthak in 10 minutes (not counting zone times) without a 
port and without invis and certainly without levitate.

1) PoK to Paineel to Warrens, Book down to Tox, enter paineel, and zone 
to warrens. You can safely do this as any race class by around level 2. 
2-3 minutes.

2) Warrens to Stonebrunt. This is a lowbie dungeon and the hardest part 
of the trip. To do it naked and unbuffed you'll need to be around 25th 
level and will likely have train by the end. By 30th its a cakewalk. 
Gunthak is aimed at 30th so that shouldn't be an issue. Takes 3-4 
minutes to cross.

3) Stonbrunt to Gunthak. This is a higher level zone, but its outdoors, 
and not that dense. Its pretty easy to make the run to the dock without 
bumping into anyone. Again at 30th level there is very little that would 
be a serious threat in the south part of the zone anyways. 3-4 minutes.

The only thing I would even consider trying to get for a run to gunthak 
is sow to speed the process up, and further reduce any risk from getting 
aggroed. But if you are 30th+ and can't do it butt naked you need to 
take a break from leveling and spend some time learning the ins and outs 
of the rest of eq. =)
