Depends on what they're selling and for how much.

If thats what they're doing, fine.   But if they're hoping to catch someone
not noticing that it is a no rent item, then it's pretty sleezy.  It's
hardly new though.   Even in the olden days of EC, there were people who
would try to "trade" thier summoned weapons for "equally good" items.

As with all things in this game, Caevat emptor.
