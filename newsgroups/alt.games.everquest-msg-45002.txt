It does happen all the time, and as you say, only one account and
one machine is needed to pull it off.  On the new server though, the
"bar is raised" as I said, since you can only have one character
per account, you'll need that second account to do this, and I submit
that camping out far enough to switch accounts will probably
exceed rot time, so you'll need a second machine and a second
connection... which some people are also running already.

By "raised the bar" I"m not saying that new tactics will be
introduced, only that lesser tactics will be eliminated, making
the twinks a rarer breed, and one that spends more money
with Verant.
