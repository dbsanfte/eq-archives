I thought as much yeah. I stood in the middle of Runneye (well the first
level anyway) and watched thousands of people not coming in. I was alone in
there for a good 2 hours, then I gave up and left. Easy trip though
I'll give HHK a go next.

Hehehe, hey don't knock the firepot room. I found out about it when I was
lvl 6, I went there at 12 when I got bind. The journey was long and
dangerous. I wasn't all to worried about getting killed, I kept binding on
the next island and so on and soforth. But dying while swimming and then
having to get your corpse from somwhere in the middle of nowhere Geez.
