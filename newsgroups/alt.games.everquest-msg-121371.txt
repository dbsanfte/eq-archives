    I imagine the abbreviations "WTF" and "OMG" came up a lot. They
apparently didn't have a lot of time to type longer words.

    They're pretty unified on that one - they blame the enchanter that did
the /shout. After all, he started the chain of events, right? Right?

    They raid with recruits, so they need a channel that everyone can read
for instructions (and /say is range-limited). But, get this....

    They still use shout.

    Apparently they're worried that someone will let something slip to the
recruits regarding their l33t strategies if they use a chat channel (the
moderation command has successfully evaded them). So they continue to use
/shout for everything, including heal calls. One of our most sarcastic
wizards has taken to calling all his nukes and other spells in shout
whenever they're in zone. Nothing like seeing

in bright red letters on your screen for a laugh.

    FV is a roleplaying server. I can just imagine the situations where this
would come up. "My lord, Wolfhugger Moonfyre hath made bad cheese with his
Baking skill!" "Quick! Clerics, camp!"

    /poke ;-)
