Er - that's the area he would be referring to.  "In Ak'Anon" I think
was just out of habit.  There are no hunting grounds *in* Ak'Anon
(unless you're a necro - mmmm, dead cuteness).  Dunno what you mean by
'relatively safe' - have you SEEN the place since they added those new
mobs?  Cats and - what's the other thing, wolves of some sort? All I
really remember is getting 2 cats on me and standing up to go get a
drink before I even died - that are nastily red and aggro on sight.
At least the red mobs in GFay won't attack unless you hit first.
