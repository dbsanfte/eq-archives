Actually, they were ezboards and such long before VI pulled the plug, at
least for some servers.

E.g., the message board for The Nameless is The Nameless Tavern
(http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern.html), and has been for
at least as long as I've been playing (about 16 months).

Your best bet is to ask aronud on your server, because what makes
a message board *the* message board for a server is simply that the
majority of the top players and guilds recognize it as such.
