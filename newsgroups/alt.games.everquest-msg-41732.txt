Well to a degree. There is a point where when a warrior checks an area
to get a group and there is none, he runs and takes a boat and such
taking up an hour and 40 minutes of his time when he only has 2 and a
half hours to play that night. That is fairly ridiculous. I understand
what you are saying and what Verant is saying when they "want to make
the world large", but subjecting a player to that is ridiculous.

Please don't tell me you will answer like verant and say "he can get a
port or bring people who can port with him." Everyone can't get a
port, or bring people to port. Expecting customer service from another
player as a way to solve a design problem is ridiculous.

I have a druid but I think you should really try getting around with a
twink who is not your druid. I have a troll sk who I ran from lake of
ill omen to western karana, via normal overland running and taking the
overthere boat. It took on hour plus to get to west k. Worse than
that, from the middle of west k simply to erudin dock took another
hour via basically the slowest boat in norrath. Sometimes I do that
just to remind me of how flawed the game is in that respect, since as
a druid you do tend to forget.

Other players often are not waiting to help ease that problem for you,
sometimes you will have to run and it takes too long. Boats take 3.65
minutes to start to move after zoning, on both sides on the way to
velious for example. Kunark is similar. So its not just the distance
that is making such trips seem longer, but that the boat can take over
3 minutes to move once its zoned.

To call objecting to this "whining" is like calling it whining if for
no apparent reason when walking down my stairs I have to instead
crawl down them over broken glass.
