It would help if I wasn't slightly poor, only 10k to my name now, and that
would barely be enough to get the components for the first one (only guy on
the server that publicly makes golden idols is a bastard, just doubled his
price on the tunare one to 4k, no way I'm buying that, he even said he has
way too many imbued emeralds already, and that's the bottleneck of the
recipe besides mana vial)

At least my baking and brewing are high enough to get those done without too
much trouble, and I know an enchanter that I can get to enchant the stuff
that needs it, or for the JC combines.  The lotus pie is a bit of a
bottleneck though, since no one hardly ever kills them.

I'll probably go insane on the tailoring part though.
