	 Don't remember offhand and too lazy to open the browser again, but
neither had a range over 200...in fact I don't think either even had a 200
range, pretty sure they're both 150's.

	I do stand corrected in that there is one more bow in Kael: the War Bow of
Rallos Zek.  It's still only range 180 though.  (Dropped by the AoW, with
stats to match; Sean of FoH clocked just under 16K damage in two minutes of TS
with one....)
