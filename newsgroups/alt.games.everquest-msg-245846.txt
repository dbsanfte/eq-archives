My way through Trials 1 to 5.
Joined a Highend raiding guild more by accident :),1st day they did
the Smith Rondo event,which gave me the flags for Trials 1 to 4.

Now the weird part how to get T5 without killing even 1 mob:
Guild called T5 flagging today,all move to Barindu-safe spot.
They formed a expedition party with the 6 most uber player on the
server,who did the actually expedition.
When finished 1 of the "uber"players left the expedition,and a not 
so "uber" player was invited in the expedition,zoned in the expedition
zone,was killed,summouned by a necro to a spot with a quest npc,
said one word(sorry forget what it was),clicked on a stone,got 
temporary flag,was killed again,was summoned again,left expedition,
hailed High Priestes in Barindu,said issues to a npc named Gurru,
voila T5.
If you find this confusing then I am with you. :)
