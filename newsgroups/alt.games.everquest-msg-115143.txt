Nope, my guild is much like yours.  We have only one CoM/HS rogue and he's
on Pacific time (most of the rest of us are right-coasters) AND is a nurse
or doctor or something with insane work hours and schedules.  We usually
have to rely on extraguild help regarding rogues...and one just isn't
enough.
