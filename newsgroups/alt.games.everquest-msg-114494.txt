When the horses first came out,  I had heard that the cheapest ones were
just faster than run,  but there was no information as to how fast the 100k
horses were.

I purchased a  37k horse, thinking it would be faster than sow...... wrong.
If anything, it was JUST below sow, so im guessing Jboot speed.

After determining that sitting on a horse while fighting was a death trap
since manueverability was horrible,  I decided to sell it when it was
finally allowed.

Thinking that EQ has been notorious about paying low for some items, and the
stable hand who will purchase the horse back doesnt tell you how much he
will give you.. I decided to test it out  by buying a 9,800p horse and
selling it back.

with high charisma.. I sold it back and got back 7600p.  Doing the math, I
figured I would probably lose about 6k on the deal, and I was ok so turned
in the reins.

I got back 18k.

OUCH!!  I even think I saw the NPC laugh.

well, until some improvements are made to horses,  I have purchased the
cheapest horses I could for my alts that med, since it is great for this
purpose ( if you forget to sit).
