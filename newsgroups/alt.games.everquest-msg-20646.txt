Read it long ago :-)

 I disagree with anyone who refers to someone being less then human on the
name they choose. So while your reading the PnPs, take time to read the
Harassment policies too "Chief". I still haven't found any reference to
Vacuum Cleaner though , should I read it again ?

Oh, and by the way. I also fail to see the importance of the word "ass" in
the last paragraph. Can you post the profanity policy too for the public? If
ya need the link, lemme know.

No offense , but no banana either

Have a Nice day
