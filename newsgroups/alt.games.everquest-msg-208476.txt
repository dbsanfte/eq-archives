It's not rechargeable. It does, however, sell back to a vendor for about 14pp
which is almost enough to buy all the pieces for a new one  - 2 Gears, 1 Metal
Rod, 1 Bottle, 1 Firewater (tinkered, 1 Water + 1 Gnomish Spirits).

Items that ARE rechargeable can be recharged by anyone. So, if you bought an
Anizok's Minimizing Device you can put the used-up device and a class 6 mana
battery in a toolbox and hit combine. It's no-fail.
