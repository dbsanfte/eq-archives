    Heh. When we do Emperor, one of the biggest complaints is how long the
damn thing takes to pop. ;-)

    You wanted the veil.

    Mace of Confusion isn't the best PRI item in the world, especially with
the Wand of Casual Blessings being as relatively easy as it is to get. But
at least it's a HP boost.

    I doubt many people asked for it. Usually when we get one, it's a
"someone take this PLEASE" item even though we have many clerics that have
epic in PRI. Usually it's druids or shamans that end up taking it.

    More importantly, with the new levels if something is beating on you
you're going to be doing all you can to save yourself, like self-healing and
DA, rather than swinging away and hoping for a proc. Nice idea in theory,
doesn't really work in practice.

    There's a series of high-end cleric weapons with useless procs. We're a
class designed around maximal medding, and around safety and reliability.
Procs, being random, are useless to us unless they're so frequent that other
classes get jealous.
