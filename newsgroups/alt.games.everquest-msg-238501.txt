If the SOE hard drives survive until the end of the world, your
character will also last that long.
Your character will never taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether
by erasure or the slow decay of
time, your character will never die.

Your character will never come to death, an image of the splendor of
mmorpgs in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. On their
hard drives it will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in
winger that comes without a star. There it will dwell, bound to the
drive, under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the
long years of our lives are utterly spent.
