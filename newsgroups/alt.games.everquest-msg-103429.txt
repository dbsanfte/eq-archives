You do play this game right?

Ok, in case you haven't noticed the same armour will look different
depending on what race is wearing it.
There is NO visable face armour so what you have seen is a helm of some sort
but none of the half elf helms I know of cover the face (at least not with
Luclin graphics)

So I ask again, on what race have you seen this helm that covers the lower
face. I'm not denying it's existance, only whether or not it would appear
that way when you wear it.
