I am posting to the NG in the hopes that someone will be able to point me in
the right direction on a dabacle of mine. Viarra has reached the lofty level
of 53 ( Well lofty to ME anyways :)  ), and I would like to be able to find
a spot where I can grind out some cash so that I can better equip some of my
wifes characters.  Experience is not an issue, Ill burn, errr, cross THAT
bridge later! I know that a decent amount of platinum can be made by killing
the Hill GIants in Mt Rathe, and by quadding the Wyverns in CS for their gem
drops. Unfortunately neither of these places are really feasable for me, as
they are HEAVILY contested areas. Since I play on a Zek server contested
areas = PvP, somthing that I really dont like to participate in lightly. I
have thought about going down to the Geonids (sp?)  in Crystal Caverns, but
I wasnt sure if a druid could solo that spot at all.

Does anyone else have any suggestions wher eI might want to test the waters
? As I said Viarra is level 53 with 1520hp, 765ac, and 214 Wisdom with self
buffs. Ac is probably pretty low, as I havent, willingly, gotten into hand
to hand combat with a critter in probably the last 10-15 Levels.

Any and all suggestions are much appreciated!!
