We are not saying clerics are useless, we are saying that it is not
necessary to have one in order to have an excellent group.

I am not, and never have disputed that clerics have the best heals in
the game, and that they have the best rez in the game, if you discount
the veteran AA Expedient Recovery anyway which is only usable once a
week or something.

I often group with clerics, I often group without clerics.  Some of the
best xp groups I have been in did not have a cleric, enchanter, or a
warrior.
