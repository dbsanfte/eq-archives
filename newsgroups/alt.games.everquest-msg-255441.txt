SWG Could have had 400K users, had it not sucked. :D But, while I see 
your point, I don't know if the MMORPG could survive long-term with 50K 
people. I think the upfront cost and the maintenance cost would simply 
be too much. Games are costing more and more to make and taking longer 
and longer to complete. Add that cost to the massive support and 
maintenance that goes along with a MMORPG and I just don't think you can 
survive on a model that requires a lot of games with small subscribers.
