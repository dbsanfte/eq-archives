That's rather different from my experience with WoW and EQ.  I started
playing WoW a month after launch, and I'd have to say it's been
extremely stable and bug free.  EQ1 had quite a few bugs... none that
made me want to not play but stuff like waiting for the boats and
having no idea if they would ever show up... quests that you would
start and then find out that they were broken... areas where you
weren't supposed to stand and fight because the pathing was broken and
fighting there would be considered an exploit, etc etc etc.

My favorite one was doing a spell combine and having the results poof
because it was lore and I already had a copy in the bank.  wouldn't
have mattered so much except that the only copy of that spell on the
bazaar was listed at 18,000 plat  Having it poof was kinda
unfortunate.

And of course there was the incredible bazaar lag where you had to
look at a wall or the floor in order to be able to do anything.  

I haven't encountered anything remotely this bad on WoW.  It's not
perfect, but it's definitely a step up in stability.
