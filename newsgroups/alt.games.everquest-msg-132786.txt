}>Well, feel free to compose your answer so as not to make them curious 
}>about the deeper parts, if you want, but if you don't satisfy that child's 
}>curiosity...  Well, see twohead's post over there, he said it really, 
}>really well.  Suffice it to say, you'd be in for woe.  Serious woe.
}Oh I agree with that 1000% and nothing I have said should be construed
}otherwise.
}Maybe I am just mis-understanding what TH and Lesa are saying, but it
}sounds like they are advocating full disclosure of everything.

I think they are advocating answering the child's question, period.  They 
haven't said "in full gory detail", nor do I think they would.

}And that is what I disagree with at such a young age.
}By all means, answer their questions with as much detail as the PARENT
}feels is appropriate..
}However, this discussion is (or was) about letting a Muppet do it FOR
}the parent...

And I think you are assuming that the muppet wil have to go into full, 
gory detail.  I think The producers of Sesame Street should be given 
credit for enough intelligence to reveal the barest minimum necessary to 
teach what they want to teach, which, in this case, I think it is safe to 
assume, is tolerance.

I doubt that going into more detail than absolutely necessary would be 
anything other than a hindrance in teaching what they are trying to... So 
IF this muppet were to be a reality, especially in the United States, I 
think it is very safe to assume that it will be implemented in such a way 
that the topic of 'sex' or anything even vaguely close to it won't even 
come up.

But if you think they're idiotic enough to implement this in such a 
blatantly stupid way, why are you even letting these people teach your kid 
to read?  Even more, I can think of one popular SS song I've always very 
much liked that teaches tolerance of people with different, non-nuclear, 
family styles.  They did that brilliantly, as far as I was concerned.  I 
would be all in favor of letting them have a go at this one.

I think that it is safe to say, as well, that it would be shown to test 
audiences first, and honed and refined before it was ever brought anyhere 
near the airwaves.  And I'm sure if they couldn't come up with something 
that satisfied an overwheming fraction of their market, they would scrap 
it before your 2-year-old ever even saw it.
