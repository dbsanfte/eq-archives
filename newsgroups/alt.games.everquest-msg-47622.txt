This already happens unless you are experiencing bad lag, it's something
like 5 to ten seconds of invis to all, when zoning into a new zone.  It
was the compromise reached after rogues kept bitching that they can't
sneak/hide across a zone line, but all other forms of invis last while
zoning.  It's basically enough time that after zoning you can hit hide
and not be seen,  That's about it, but every little bit helps.

They are getting pets according to the spell info gleaned for luclin so
far, AND unlike every other pet class, they can zone with their pets.
