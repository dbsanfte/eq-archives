It's really simple to find there.

goto www.allakhazam.com

click on Quests... By Zone...

click on Great Divide (That would be where the war occurs).

The last quest listed there looks promising, ring #10.

Last I knew, no subscription required for that, I don't know if this is
still the case, I subscribe, I find the vast amount of information there to
be very useful to me, and well worth $9.99 every 3 months.  Not to mention,
the subscription pays for several other useful sites as well, such as
www.eqatlas.com, to remove the ads.
