Thanks.  I bought it in the Erudin wiz guild...I assumed a high lvl wiz
didn't want to be bothered with auctioning it and sold it to the vendor.
Right now my lvl17 warrior has it equipped for 2HS practice.  I think I'll
wait til I see some auction pricing on my server (Povar) before I try to
sell it.
