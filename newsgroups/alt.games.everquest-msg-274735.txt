Saying that you'd like to play a game for an hour or two w/o spending
most of that time setting up is not demanding "instant gratification".
When you decide to play basketball, how would you feel if you spent an
hour calling up all your buddies, an hour riding the bus to the court,
and 15 minutes playing before you had to leave?

 The key is scritchy's first sentence, so I'll repeat it here:
  "Is frustration really the same as immersion?"
