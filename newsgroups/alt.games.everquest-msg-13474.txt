Lately sow has become more of a fighting tactic than a save your ass tactic.
Either the druid or my wizzy gets a snare on the giant, then I blast him
good and back up.  Now the giant follows me and the rogue gets free
backstabs.  Works great.  Less pain for the tanks so less healing mana used.
And since I never have to overnuke to save the tanks I use less mana too.
