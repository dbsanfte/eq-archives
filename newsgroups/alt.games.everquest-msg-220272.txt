The point I made was that usage of sense/disarm traps in ldon certainly
*does* imply that "designers were actually considering how to make
Sense/Disarm Traps useful in the game".  That you are not happy with their
initial attempt does not mean that consideration was not made.  I would also
disagree with your observation that boxes and floor traps are normally
ignored.  In my experience the point man usually calls for floor trap
disarming, and boxes are normally opened at the end. The only ones lethal
are poison, and if you just have a couple people with poison removal ready
you should be fine (just wait till the end tho).  On release the rewards
were not worth it but they are tuning that.  I'm not sure what your point is
regarding bards.  I play a bard and make much use of these skills.  What
could be wrong with that?
