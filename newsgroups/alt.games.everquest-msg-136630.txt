Just a couple of comments from an anthropologist about the HIV Sesame 
Street character controversy: One thing to keep in mind is that the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is much bigger than in the United States, 
and has never been confined to what we consider risk groups in the U.S. 
Most Africans with HIV are heterosexual, and the epidemic is so 
extensive that there are hundreds of thousands of orphaned children, 
many of whom themselves are infected.  It is not uncommon for men in 
many African countries to have either more than one wife, or to frequent 
prostitutes (especially since many of them engage in labor migration -- 
moving to some area like a mine or factory for 6 to 8 months of the year 
and then coming home to their home villages and wives only for a couple 
of months each year).  Men may also have one legal wife and then another 
woman with whom they have children and who they support in a house.  In 
addition, it is not uncommon for some of the prostitutes who appear 
female to be transexuals.  When you add in other cultural practices like 
female circumcision which can make it hard to have vaginal intercourse 
or which may necessitate cutting open the scar whenever the man comes 
home for his annual visit, you can get a sense of why HIV is so 
prevalent in the general population. So in Africa, an HIV positve 
character actually has nothing to do with homosexuality as we understand 
it in the U.S., and portrays something that is more of an everyday 
reality for African children than it is for many U.S. children.

Add in the general levels of poverty, lack of child labor laws or other 
forms of legal protections for children, very young ages of marriage for 
girls, lack of protection from sexual harrassment and molestation, and a 
common, incorrect belief among some Africans that sex with a virgin 
cures AIDS leading to a growth in both forced child prostitution and 
child rape --keeping in mind how many AIDS orphans and war refugees, and 
children from homeless families have no legal protections and no parents 
who can protect them from being forced into such work, and you can see 
that the population of children who might watch Sesame Street in Africa 
are dealing with very different issues from the much more protected U.S. 
middle class.

The HIV positive character in African Sesame Street responds to the 
extremity of the emergency now engulfing so many African countries and 
ought not to be judged harshly from our own, so much more priveleged 
situation.
