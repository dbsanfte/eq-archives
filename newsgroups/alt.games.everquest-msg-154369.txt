"Botting" is running more than 1 character at the same time. This is
usually done with more than 1 PC with keyboards and mice within easy
reach. Some people use a program called EQW (EQ Windows). This program
allows you to run EQ in a windows instead of fullscreen mode. If you
have enough system horsepower, it is possible to run 2-3 EQ sessions
(which requires 2-3 paying accounts) on the same PC.

"Macros" are hot-key shortcuts. For example, let's say you are
"botting"playing a Warrior and Cleric. To keep the warrior healed in a
fight you could create the following macro as a social key....

/sit off
/target <Warrior's name>
/cast 1 (heal in spell slot one)

The put the social key onto a hot button. When the warrior needs a
heal just click on the button. If the spell fizzles, hit the button
again. With a good set of macros and the right combination of classes
(you wouldn't want to try and bot two classes that require a lot of
concentration...Bard/Enchanter for example), you don't have to work
much harder than you do when running only 1 character.
