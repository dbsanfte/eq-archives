Rangers are on the same damage table, get more easily available weapons
of high quality up to about level 56-58, get an innate offense bonus
starting at level 56 and get a whole range of direct ATK buffs.

I find it hard to believe that in melee output a warrior is going to
outdamage a ranger. Of course, thats not to say a warrior doesnt rock
from the point of view of survivability of that output.

Defensive is just plain awesome, and as a 59 ranger I have to bow out to
any warrior above around level 54 as a tank ;) Not just for the disciplines,
but even my AC/HP obsessed self cant keep up beyond there, despite the
level difference ;)
