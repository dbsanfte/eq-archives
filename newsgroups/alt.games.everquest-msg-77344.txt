With the new Luclin AE resist songs, you don't need a bard in every group, 
but it's still nice to have, if just for the entertainment value alone.  
On raids when I'm singing buffs I can raise PR/DR or FR/CR by 114, and MR 
by 202.  Yeah, it makes a HUGE difference.

Remember, necros with essence emeralds have a nice rez, and they can 
feign.  It's not a bad idea to have a necro stand back out of AE range, 
dump mana on the clerics, and if things go bad, feign dead.  When the 
slaughter is over, necro rezzes epic or senior cleric, then get a monk and 
rogue back, and start pulling corpses.

This is nice for smaller mobs, but when you're dealing with stuff that 
hits for 500+ you'll want more than one cleric for the MA group.  We've 
had good luck with 2 tanks, 3 clerics, and a bard.

Yeah, good stuff here, though you really don't need a cleric if folks 
learn to control aggro.  I still have a hard time convincing myself to 
create groups with melees with no clerics, but I'm learning.  We're also 
lucky in that up to 25% of the people at our big raids are clerics.

A good place to put an extra bard, and the original level 32 manasong 
stacks with itself and all other manasongs.  More mana, more nukes, more 
damage, faster kills.

Mages nuke almost as well as wizards, if you're doing mod rods, make 'em 
while buffing, Mages should be nuking.
