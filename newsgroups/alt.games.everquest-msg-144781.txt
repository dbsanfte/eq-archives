I just did that quest with my baby cat...went from dubious to amiable 
just from completing it.  The key to getting the adjustment is to go all 
the way thru echo and back for the last step and getting a necklace.  If 
you don't get the necklace or the lore message you don't get the big 
adjustment.  Going back and forth from Sateal in the bazaar doesn't give 
an adjustment that is worth the trouble, even though it says your 
faction has gotten better.
The steps are Tradecommish Henry ==> Sateal==> Henry ==> some dude in FG 
I forget his name ==> back to Henry   if you don't do the 4th and 5th 
step you may as well not do the first 3.
