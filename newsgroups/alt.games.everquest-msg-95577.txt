Alt Advance is something for higher levels, like 60th levels who probably
want more things.  For those of us who are 51+, it also allows us to
corrects character generation mistakes.  For example, I know some necros
who stated they screwed up on a character generation point and are dumping
a lot of their xp into getting 'Innate Int' up to fix it.  Even people who
have had decent attributes are using it to boost other aspects.  There are
skills in there that would allow players to become almost uber mob level
type characters, sunce as Combat Fury for melee based characters,
increasing the chance of critical hits, or pushing the limits on things,
such as First aid upping the % hp healed due to bandages, which is a plus
for those who cannot cast heal spells, and even a plus for those who do
cast heal spells (Means less mana needed to heal a party if you can bandage
up a few more times and more people healed.  Especially for people who are
not Clerics.)

There are currently 3 types of Alt Advance.  General, which everyone has
options in, class (I think) which generally focuses a little more towards
the type of class your character is, then Arch, which focuses primarily on
your class of character.  The general has no minimum requirement save that
you are 51st level and have 1 alt advance point.  Class will require you to
be at the very least, 54 or 55th in level and dedicate somewhere between 5
to 6 points in general, in some cases.  Arch will require you to at least
spend 10 to 12 points in Class, and in most cases, will require one of the
Arch skills to be set at a certain level.  In the cases of Class and Arch,
the point requirements are higher to get up to the next level.

What I have not gotten clarification, is the amount of XP to gain one Alt
Advance point.  Or at least, if the gaining of 1 alt advance point is at a
set level, and independant of previous points or your current level.  It
would suck like hell if you have to do exponential work on your Alt
Advancement points.
