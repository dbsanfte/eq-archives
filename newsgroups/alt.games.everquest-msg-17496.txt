}To the best of my knowledge, when two identical (i.e. same name) spells are
}cast on one target, only the stronger one has any effect.  This is why you
}can't SoW yourself, then SoW yourself again, and so on, until you break the
}sound barrier.  However, if you have two <i> different </i> spells that both
}produce a slowing effect, you should be able to combine their effects.

_Unless_ they're spells in the same line, which frequently won't stack.  
There is also a problem, in my mind, with how the game determines which 
spell is the stronger...

I have a spell called Augmentation, which is an excellent melee buff that 
I get at level 29.  It is an upgrade to first Quickness (16), and then 
Alacrity (24).  However, shamans get Quickness at level 29.  So 
frequently, if I'm grouped with a shaman a couple levels higher, they'll 
overwrite my aug or alac with quickness, which provides much less speed 
enhacement, and (in the case of aug) no other melee benefits.

The upshot:  if there's a shaman and an enchanter in the group, make sure 
the enchanter's doing the speed enchancement and the shaman isn't.  
Otherwise, you end up with shamans spending way too much mana for less 
effect, and a very frustrated enchanter. :)

There's a similarly complex interplay between enchaner and shaman slowing 
spells. Between 24 and 29, assuming the enchanter has the research-only 
Tepid deeds, they will have the better slow.  Then it switches back to the 
shammy with the insects line.

Can't remember how it works at lower levels, but a little research at 
eq.castersrealm.com should set it straight. :)
