    Trains are usually caused by dungeon design, not by morons. Consider the
following:

    Morons are everywhere in EQ, but trains aren't. What does one need to
create a train?

(1) A chance of overpulling.
(2) A distance to zone-out short enough that someone can survive the run
there.
(3) People along the path to notice.

    Blackburrow has a fair spawn density, folks can get a head-start on mobs
due to the whacky pathing, and almost everyone camps right along the one
route to get to the top. Karnor's has a lot of multiple pulls, allows SoW
(so folks can get ahead of the train), and the single zone in/out area has
many people at or near it. Now consider Sebilis. Just as many morons, just
as likely to overpull, but the run to zone-out is not one someone is likely
to survive (frogs can have SoW, lots of repops between zone and camp) and
most of the camps are off the tracks (UZO being the obvious exception). And
harmful trains in Sebilis are, surprise surprise, quite rare. AoE group
pulls don't count. ;-)
