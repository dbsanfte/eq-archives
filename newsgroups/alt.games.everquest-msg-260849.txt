   Well, yeah.  I probably should have said "if any" instead of "many". 
And I know the majority of clerics ate the dot cost.  I myself was one. 
But on FV, at least, there have been complaints of diva clerics who did

thing going on too, unlike what I have seen in any other server, so maybe
this wasn't true even there.
