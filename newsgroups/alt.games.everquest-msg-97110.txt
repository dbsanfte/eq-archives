Except what they're changing is hardly like cutting exp in half and
putting in a Monty Haul low level dungeon (there's a nice fat strawman
from me to pick at ;-) ). Spellbook - gone. That's a *good* thing, no
one liked staring at that their whole career to 35. Did getting rid of
it for higher levels cause a mad leveling rush? No. L1-10 easier is a
good thing! For some bizarre reason L3-6 were some of the hardest
levels in the game, depending on where you started. Easing down the
jump from 12 kills to level at L1 to *60* at L3 if you're stuck in a
place that doesn't have many L2 and L3 monsters (or you can't handle
evens early on, like some classes) is a *good* thing - L3 for a
faydwer resident is harder than any level until 30. And so on....

It's the truth. The complainers just don't see themselves that way.
But, they have to realize there's already been many changes in the
same vein as the ones coming that did benefit them (spellbook gone at
35, death penalties reduced, exp bonuses implemented, etc) and I don't
see them complaining about THOSE. Why? Because they benefitted from
them.

It's hypocritical for someone to complain about tomorrow's patch when
they are happy about the improvements made the last two years.
