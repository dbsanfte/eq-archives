Piggy-backing as my news provider (aka my ISP) seems to be refusing
to show me my posts or direct responses to them.

Yeah Ben, inevitable, at least from the evidence I've seen.  It has
not yet failed to happen to any desirable content in EQ.  LGuk/SolB
was the most ridiculous case, but Old Seb & Karnors in Kunark saw
the same thing, currently PoV is often camped to death despite being
3 or 4 expansions old, not to mention WoS in the current release.
Ignoring the likely behavior of your players is just about as stupid
a design decision as you can make, and yet that is what you are
insisting must be done.

SOE themselves told the uber-guilders invited to the "summit"
that over half their players were L30 to 50 with no characters
over 50.  If over half the players are well behind me and those
I group and guild with, and _we_ can't even see the dust cloud
raised by the ubers at the far end of the content and gear
progression, just how many rabid raiders do you think are out
there?

No sir.  Many of my opinions are far from majority views, which
has nothing at all to do with right and wrong.

Yeah, like you self-proclaimed ubers with your efficient and
endlessly repetitive XP grinds, not to mention your constant
pharming of encounters you've already defeated many times so
that everybody can get their piece of lewt.  And let us not
overlook the legions of alts and bots PL'd and geared in all
the same places using all the same techniques over and over
again.

Try climbing down off your high horse, the rarified air up
there appears to be starving your brain for oxygen.

LDoN is/was a seriously flawed implementation of instanced content.
And yet it's 100x better than the crap which is/was Luclin, PoP, and
GoD.

Bullshit.  The game was at it's peak before they decided to focus
development on massive mindless timesinks for the raiders.

Get a fucking grip, you're completely off the edge now.  The first
and absolute worst bout of mudflation EQ saw was from the RoK
release, turned the economy upsidedown in a few weeks.  Subsequent
events have never had such a traumatic impact, tho Luclin and PoP
tried.

And that, Hagen, is because he doesn't have one for you to see.
