Given how cheap $10 is (about an hour and a half of working a minimum wage job; for
many players I expect it represents less than an hour of work), I expect that all
the downtime and patch days are already "rebated" in the cost. Or would you rather
move to an hour by hour system where you pay based on how many hours you are
connected? Or perhaps pay $30 a month and get rebate checks every time you are
personally inconvenienced?

In other words, quit your bitching and get a life outside of EQ. You see that big,
shiny thing hanging from that very distance ceiling? That's called the sun....
