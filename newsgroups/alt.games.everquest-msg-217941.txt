Afte thinking parental responsibility was a quaint custom strictly relegated
to the "good old days" I was quite refreshed to come accross the following:

Mum convicted over son's suicide
From correspondents in Meriden, Connecticut
October 7, 2003

AN American woman was today convicted of contributing to the suicide of her
12-year-old son, who hanged himself in his closet with a necktie after being
picked on for months at school over his bad breath and body odour.

Judith Scruggs, 52, of Connecticut, was found guilty of one count of risk of
injury to a minor for creating a filthy home that prosecutors said prevented
J Daniel Scruggs from improving his hygiene. She faces up to 10 years in
prison.

Scruggs was cleared of a second charge that accused her of failing to
provide her son with proper medical and psychological care. She also was
acquitted on a cruelty charge.

Experts said the case marks one of the first times in which a parent was
charged with contributing to a child's suicide.

Prosecutors said they took no joy in bringing charges against a grieving
mother, but felt a jury should decide whether Scrugg's actions contributed
to the boy's death.
