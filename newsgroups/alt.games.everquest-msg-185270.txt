    That's the old assist bug, where you get a mob to assist something
you've charmed that is on the same faction as it. This ain't that.

    I'm going to go out a bit further than that. Do any of you remember what
Crushbone was like in the old days? The male "an elven slave" would
occasionally get Stockholm Syndrome and start buffing the orcs around him.
Soon after that, he'd flip out and actually assist the orcs if you attacked
one nearby. Good old Retlon would also sometimes do the same thing - he'd
start damage shielding orcs, and a short time later he'd go berserk and
assist them. Eventually, this was fixed in a patch.

   My theory is we have the same behaviour here. A caster NPC is in a zone
with mobs she would normally kill because of faction, but who has somehow
been programmed to ignore her faction and be neutral. Over time, the "be
neutral" command becomes "be friendly" and she starts to assist the mobs. So
when our friend was caught killing a KOS to all monster, the gypsy aided the
monster and charmed the bard. If the mage had done something to get on the
hate list, like get close to the scarab or damage shield the bard during the
fight, he'd be next and indeed he was.

    I've heard of the gypsy in NK flipping out before (remember the "I am
WAAAAADDDD" story?), and I've heard of other caster NPCs doing the same. In
every case they're in zones with mobs that they'd normally go killing
willy-nilly, but which they don't for some reason.

    James
