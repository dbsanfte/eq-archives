Curses are something totally different.  There are a few curse traps in LDoN
advs on chests.  Otherwise, you aren't likely to encounter a curse unless
you are raiding.  Most of the Luclin bosses (Greig, Arch Lich...) have curse
based DoTs and some PoP bosses (Offossa the Enlightened comes to mind).
Disease and poison counters are the ones you have come to know and love, and
will encounter frequently.  Blood of Nadox is a great spell and you should
definitely get it.  It removes enough counters to cure Trak's and Hoshkar's
AEs and makes for easy curing of Wind of Tash spells.  If you aren't a
raiding type, then I would suggest just getting the Remove Curse that drops
from the Great Saphrophyte in Echo Caverns and buying Radiant Cure when you
can.  Those two ought to more than meet your every day curse curing needs.
If you are in a guild that does Ssra or higher level mobs, then talk to you
raid leader and he or she can hopefully hook you up with a copy of the
spell.  Generally RGC goes to Paladins and Shamans first, since clerics are
busy healing during the fights.
