Read the post again friend. (It was off topic, but I stand behind it)

"They are just too 1 dimensional. Nuke/Port, that's about it.
All other classes (escpecially other Wis/Int casters) have much more
rounded talents and abilities."

I never said that Wizards are not a good class. I said they were the
"most broken" compared to all the rest of the classes. An Elephant is
tiny compared to a blue whale, but compared to a man it is huge. The
comparison determines the relationship.

"In the right situation a Wizard can be the best class, but
these situations are few and far between compared to the typical EQ
exp grind. I am just expressing my opinion based on the relative
skills and attributes of the classes in EQ."

>The wizard way to play is to vaporize multiple mobs at one time and

This would be the "right situation" I mentioned above. What you fail
to grasp is that quad-kiting with AE spells (or large AE groups) is
only available to Wizards from level 34 up. From levels 1-33 Wizards
are not the first choice for grouping. (That honor goes to Tanks,
Healers, and SoWers)

>And by the way, NO PORTS FOR YOU!!!!

And by the way. NO READING COMPREHENSION FOR YOU!!!!
