I won't say you are wrong in that... I have in fact seen a request
specifying: "group looking for twinked warrior", but that has happened
only once.

On the other hand, if you think about it on a per-player basis, rather
than on a per-character basis, the twinked player has still been at it
for longer. And also, twinked characters tend to solo more, since they
can, and it's more XP-efficient.

If you had asked me a year ago, I would have agreed with you
wholeheartedly, but this is one of those things where cold harsh reality
tends to change your point of view as time passes. I would probably not
be playing my bard right now if I couldn't enjoy him looking so damn
cool in full lambent with a claw (dual claws in five more levels). I
will have to go over the rat-bashing all over again when I start a
character in the RP server, so I *really* can't be bothered to do it
again with any new characters in Fennin, or at least I will try to
minimize the time I spend doing it.
