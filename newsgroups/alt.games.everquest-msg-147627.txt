Me I carry two stacks of foraged water and some smoked grimling jerky.
Two stacks of water because during raids or long camps you'll almost
always have somebody ask "you have any food or water?  I forgot to get
some today.." or the like.

The grimling jerky is just a cheap +1 wisdom food that you can buy off
the NPC vendors in the Bazaar.  I've had the same stack now for like a
month because I just keep force feeding foraged food when I can.
