This isn't real-time, it's when you hit /loc.. so you could type /loc and
then draw a little x on a printed map if you like.  It's pretty easy when
the game gives you coordinates.  (It still seems weird to me that the game
gives you exact coordinates - especially when Sense Heading is so hard to
train up).

As for "3rd party software is expressly prohibited" can you quote the EULA
section that would prohibit MapX?  It's not modifying the EverQuest software
in any way, and it's not running on the same computer.  The EULA says "You
may not use any third-party software to modify the Software to change Game
play".  MapX doesn't modify EverQuest in any way.
