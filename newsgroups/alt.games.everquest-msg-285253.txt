Logged on yesterday to find the guild readying for Gorenaire.  I got a 
port and SOW from the guild taxi bot, hit the raid in time to get about 
half the buffs I'd like, we moved thru the tunnel, pulled, and killed. 
The shield with +40 cold resist on it dropped, I bid for it, but pulled 
out when a recent recruit with much lower points than I have bid 
everything she had.  I can respect that, and didn't do the obvious and 
bid one point more than she had.

Then we moved to Lord "Bob" in Velks, where I did end up high bidder on 
Blood Runed Greaves, which have some negative stats but still net me 
about 25 more AC, without taking my dex down below cap when raid buffed.

Then we took out the Dain, and I ended up high bidder on Frostreaver, 
which is a 2hs better than the SK epic (I refused to do the SK epic, 
with its unimpressive stats and ratio)

Then we took out Wuoshi, and I ended up high bidder on the second of the 
two Skydarkener bows that dropped; range 150 and stats for a pulling 
tool, with a proc which may or may not be a good thing; it does AE 
damage.  Not good for pulling from a harmonied camp, but not being a 
ranger thats not really a problem.  And it turns out the proc is outdoor 
only, so I'm not too concerned, outdoor mobs usually have some distance 
between them, pulling singles isn't so much of a problem.  More to the 
point, I have FD, so I can pull a group, then snare one, and FD, to 
split; what do I care if I damage the whole group?

I had to log for a while, and the raid moved on and cleared out names in 
WW and WTOV

When I rejoined them, Talendor was up... and I ended up high bidder on a 
Runed Bolster Belt, a nice jump up from my old neglected FBSS, or the 
Belt of Iniquity I used when stats and AC seemed more important than the 
difference between 16% haste and 21% haste.

Finally we took out Venril Sathir, I'm happy to say I managed not to get 
any loots off of him, or I'd really be out of DKP entirely!

Berg, 60 SK, loot whore
