Did you cancel the account before you set up billing info again?
Not saying that will work, but that might be the problem...no, you wont lose
your characters. If you cancel your account Verant will save them for a
couple of months.
I had a billing issue with them before and called, they told me to do the
same thing...cancel then rebill(they couldn't do it over the phone
apparently). *shrug*
