I would suggest Lake of Ill Omen.  I soloed there from 20 to about
29.  At the earlier levels you can hunt near where the FV river meets
the lake.  Since you have SOW you can outrun any trouble and zone
if you have to.

At higher levels there's a nice spot just north of the zone to
Frontier Mountains.  There are safe places to med in the hills on
the zone edge, and easy pickins just over the path and mountain
range.  (I think the spot is called the "saddle" by some).  You're
right near a zone boundary if things get rough.

LOIO is open enough that you could probably kite, too, although I
did mostly root/dot.

Spill the beans!!  I have an alt approaching those levels and
would love to quest through them.
