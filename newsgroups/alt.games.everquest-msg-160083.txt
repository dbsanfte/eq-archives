My highest char so far in EQ isn't even over 10 yet[just started EQ late
last month, yet I do not regret investing in PoP, why? The PoK Ports!
Playing an Erudite Foo, and want to go to Freeport instead of Qeynos? No
problem, playing in Qeynos and need some woven spider silk? port to PoK
then port to GFay. Is MOST of the expansion about high level? yes, but the
PoK port system simply makes those low level grinds much easier to deal
with.
