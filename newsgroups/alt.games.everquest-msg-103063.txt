There's no evidence whatsoever that the channel was being misused. A
couple kids were talking about how uber they were, and were being
kidlike about it. That's all he said. He said nothing about bad
language, nothing about being abusive until he tried to shove his
beliefs down their throat, nothing wrong whatsoever.

That's okay, someday you'll grow up and realize its better to listen
to evidence rather than make assumptions.

They should have gone to tells. But he hasn't said they were being
abusive, just that they were annoying him.

I'm asking the same thing about you. Some intolerant nazi decided he
didn't like other people using *the ooc channel* in a way *he* didn't
like it to be used, and instead of doing the mature thing and ignoring
them or turning off the channel, he tried to get them in trouble.

The pre-pubes weren't the only one being adolescent.

Of course there could have been more going on than he mentioned. He
said they were bragging about how uber they were, though, that's all.


>These guys were just a couple of self-absorbed jackasses with

>you seem to see fit to defend them.

Sorry you're incapable of reading English. I didn't defend them. I
attacked his lame excuse for petitioning. If there was an actual
reason for doing so, let him say it, but two people discussing
something (on topic for eq, no less) in the ooc channel is not abuse.
