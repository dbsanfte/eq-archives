I can't say anything about the monk skills, but as to the snare line of
spells I think what happened is that the resistance of certain mobs got
raised a great deal.  There are many mobs which previously I could snare on
the first try which now always resist and will nearly always be snared on
the second try.  At this point I don't think this is a run of bad luck since
it has been consistently true over a number of playing sessions and levels.
