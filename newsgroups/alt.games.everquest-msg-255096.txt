These are very good points, despite the quibble about directional aoe's. 
However, in general, I find I want the melee DPS in the back arc, and the 
pets if it can be managed, but -not- the casters themselves.  This is 
probably different in a raid situation, as I haven't raided much as a 
warrior yet, but in a group, I'm one of the people who pushes the mob 
around the most, by hitting, kicking, or bashing it.  And it is far better 
to be pushing the mob away from the casters, because of how proximity 
aggro works.  If they're in the back arc, and (casters being how they 
are... :) ) nuking, dotting, and debuffing their little brains out to 
compete with me for aggro, and my bash pushes the mob a tenth of a loc 
unit -toward- them, my proximity aggro drops just as theirs rises, which 
can steal aggro.  And then once aggro is stolen, the mob heads straight 
for them, making my prox. aggro drop even more and theirs skyrocket...

On the other hand, if I'm between the mob and the casters, and I push the 
mob back a couple loc units, mine drops, but theirs drops even more to 
compensate, so I stay on top.  And if they steal aggro, the mob moves back 
toward me first, and I may be able to regain aggro from the increased 
proximity without doing a thing.  The only problem is if they pass me on 
the aggro list enough to actually pull the mob past me, I may have to back 
up, or turn around and look for the mob.

Most of the melee DPS I don't have to worry about stealing aggro.  The 
rogue can evade, the berz can do whatever that thing berzes do is, the 
ranger can jolt or ranger gate, the pally/SK can stop stunning/snaring 
so dang early, the crazed melee enchanter can boggle, and any of them can 
turn attack off for a second or two.
