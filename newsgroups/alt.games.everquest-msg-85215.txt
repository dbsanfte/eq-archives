East Commons is the zone of choice still, but I've started seeing a good
deal of auctioning going on in Nexus, and a bit starting to stir in Bazaar.

The thing is, Bazaar wasn't designed to (entirely) wipe out auctioning in
other places.  It's also not quite finished.  There will (we are told)
eventually be a system whereby one gives items to a vendor, and he sells
them for you.

I agree that access is a bit of an issue, but come on -- you can get there
from every continent.  It's easy access on, uh, Odus.  8)
