I must admit, DT, that the best stuff I had on my rogue was either not 
useable on my wizard, or was better suited (for my purposes at least) to 
being sold or given away, and the proceeds dumped into my other chars.

Maybe, if I had started a Warrior or something that doesn't NEED spells, 
I'd have saved up enough cash to purchase some decent gear.  As it is, my 
newbie quest gear is holding out nicely for me...decent stats and can't 
really beat the +INT and +MANA that most of it has :)

At any rate, I have no way to twink Miznit furthur, nor to twink any 
other char (other than a shared plat slot at the bank).  When I get my 
next circle of spells, I thnk I will be using up alot of what I've 
managed to save thus far, anyway.  (And the necro is just a "for fun when 
I want a change" toon at that, so who cares if she gets the good stuff?  
She's only 14 now.)
