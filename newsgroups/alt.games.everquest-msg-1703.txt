Bull. Through 49 levels of playing a cleric and 33 of playing a
warrior, I've *never* begged or paid for a teleport or SoW. 
Druids sure beg me for resurrections, though. (Although necros 
may be worse; it's close.)

Ha. Emerald Jungle is no problem. Never had anything aggro on me
that I didn't see first, and the visibility isn't bad for a jungle.
Compare that to forested parts of Warslik's Woods or Swamp of No Hope.

Only lazy players "need" SoW.
