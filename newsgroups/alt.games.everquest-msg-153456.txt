There is a port for EJ but City of Mist is actually a city if i recall
correctly and I would love to be able to take some people right to a Shaman
epic mob or the Shadowknight Epic.

I guess your point is valid, there are so many ports that it probably isn't
every going to be considered, but the question is, if you could bind on the
5th isle in Air and port people there, is that really a bad thing.  You are
saving time right?  And I would think that is a good thing for most people,
even verant.
