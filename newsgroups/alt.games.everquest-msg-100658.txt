If you would put $50.00 into your computer a year instead of letting it go for 4
years w/o any kind of upgrade then you wouldn't have these problems.  Your
system was top of the line over 4 years ago.  I know your system is above the
minimum, but come on,  spend a few dollars and upgrade something.

I am sure that's EQ is not the only piece of software that runs a bit slow on
your computer.

When is the last time you reinstalled windows, updated your video drivers,
flashed your motherboard bios, did windows updates.....etc....

You computer gets slower every day you boot it up.  Windows is a far from
perfect operating system.  You have to put in actual work to keep it running
well.

Just my .02

Let the flames begin.
