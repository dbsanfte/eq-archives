I can answer the question you pose in the subject line right now - you
should rejoice that you're not in that guild any more.

So... after enough people who remained in the guild got pissed off at
their actions in regard to you, they got a clue and came crawling to
you?

>any thoughts on how i should have handled this better?

Tell them politely, "thanks but no thanks" - no need to stoop to their
level and be rude about it, but personally *I* wouldn't rejoin a guild
where the hot-headed leader had tossed me out for reporting a rule
violation.

There was nothing about your handling that was in error - the mistakes
were theirs.
