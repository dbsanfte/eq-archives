Yeah, I doubt it will go live...to much opportunity to really annoy
people.  E.g., you get some low level dungeon monster, that is
indifferent or better to most things in the dungeon.  Go find a group
that is fighting, and that has a couple adds mezzed.  Break mez for
them.  Or just train some more adds to them.  So what if you die?  The
monster is a throw-away.

What would be cool would be to restrict it to certain zones and
certain mobs.  E.g., anyone pressing "Monster" gets some kind of
Blackburrow gnoll or Crushbone orc (this could change over time).
Also make it so the monsters in the zone get a separate /shout channel
only they can see and use, so they can coordinate among themselves.
You'd then essentially have self-run events, where the regular players
try to clear out intelligent gnolls or orcs.

This kind of thing would even be appropriate on non-PvP servers, and
would give them something to challenge Dark Age of Camelot's RvR,
which by all accounts is turning out to be very entertaining.  (And
yes, Verant almost certainly needs to respond to DAoC.  In the first
two weeks, DAoC got over 100k subscribers, and have about 35k playing
at once each night, and have had no major bugs yet, and is more stable
and available than EQ.  Verant has the advantage of several more years
of content development, but if they don't keep moving, they will lose
that advantage over time.  It's going to be interesting to see how
things develop with two good games competing.  AO just didn't turn out
to be a serious challenge to EQ, because of all their bugs).

I started as a skeleton *under* Field of Bone.  We'd known for a long
time that mobs end up under the world sometimes, particularly in FoB,
but I didn't realize they actually spawn there.  Did figure out how to
get out: go north to the water, and you'll eventually pop out in the
water, where you can swim to the surface, and then keep going until
you see land behind you (you first pop out in the cliffs, although it
looks like water to you).  You can then turn around and come ashore.
