Hi There

Well it had to happen.

A group I was in failed a LDoN mission. Slaughter 60 nasties in 
Mistmoore's Catacombs: Aisles of Blood.

We were a party of Ranger 42(Me), Ranger 39, Cleric 37, Bard 38, Monk 40 
and Wizard ??

So what when wrong?

Well for one thing was I was Main Tank for the first time ever in a 
group. Being a ranger who always seems to end up on the receiving end of 
a most fights I have been in. I thought piece of cake as long as my 
armour holds and the cleric can keep up with my minuscule health!

WRONG. I couldn't hold aggro for toffee. The best was a ping-pong 
between me the other ranger and the bard. The worse was. Me the ranger, 
the bard and the cleric!

Second was the continuous multiple pulls.

As we started badly. The bard and cleric went forward. The bard made one 
nasty sad. Then the cleric calmed the other 2. the bard then pulled his. 
We got all three?

Well it was a fight but, we won!

So on we went after a few more singles.

Aggro is bouncing around like disco dancer on speed. I am hitting taunt 
(a key I haven't use in a while. But it is maxed), kick, beg and disarm 
as well as snaring, stinging swarm and darn right ranger nukes (okay, 
damp squibs)!

Then the disaster. A corridor with single nasty, room beyond with 2 
visible nasties. The bard made the corridor one sad. The cleric calmed 
the 2 visible in the room.

The bard pulled the corridor one. Hey presto we get 5??. Me, the bard 
and the cleric are rooted. The 4 from the room go for the cleric. I get 
one off him. The bard gets the corridor nasty. The other ranger and monk 
go in to help the cleric. Our health falls faster than Exxon share 
prices.

I die, the cleric dies. the wizard does a lesser evac after recovering 
from stun, he gets the monk, himself and the other ranger. The bard 
finds himself with 3 nasties and not a lot he can do as he is still 
rooted. Ouch!

The other ranger goes linkdead during the evac. I don't blame him.

Well after we recover. We decide to go on, for the experience if not the 
goal.

A few more singles. Aggro still a pain. The nasties rooting abilities 
are a right royal pain in the neck. But we are coping. Just.

We lose the bard in another multiple pull. The cleric resurrects him as 
we are now definitely not out to win.

Then finally the decider.

We get to a T junction. The wizard uses a weird eye thing and goes and 
looks around. He reports that their are 2 off to the right and 2 
directly in front. The 2 in front are closer. the cleric and the bard go 
in. The bard makes the closest 1 sad. The cleric calms the rest.

The bard pulls his. We get both those from the front? they are joined in 
quick succession by the 2 from around the corner??

The 2 from the front go for the bard while the 2 from around the corner 
go for the cleric. As per usual THEY!! root us.

Our health drops faster than we can swear 'Oh! *&^%'

The monk FD's, the wizard gets his lesser evac off. We all appear back 
at the start. Blinking in disbelief.
While we all congratulate the wizard on his reactions.

We decide to call it a night.

It wasn't a total disaster. One of our party got 1 in Halfling while we 
were waiting to regroup. Also the wizard was able to increase his melee 
skills quite a bit!!

So what went wrong.

Well from now on I will be calling Main Tanks who can hold aggro SIR.

As for the pacifying. I have never seen so many resists. In fact I don't 
think he got one to hold all evening??

So finally to the question. How could I have held the aggro better.

My ranger is my main. So I have no other sources of equipment.

My weaponry is a Wakazashi of the Frozen Sky (From the quest) and a 
Centi Short Sword (A present from someone who I helped by tracking for 
his epic) I have a haste item in the Swiftclaw Sash (From the quest)
I do have a Morins Short Sword (From the quest, it was my 2nd until I 
got the Centi) in the bank.

I am maxed on 1 hand slash. But only have 22 in 2 handed slash ( I have 
a Blood Encrusted Two-handed Sword of the Warlord in the Warrens) I 
think I may know the right end to hold onto of all the other weapon 
types a ranger can use.

All suggestions will be gratefully received, while any derision will be 
justifiably accepted.
Yours
