	Nowhere, really...corpses can always be summoned, in theory.

	In practice, some zones have zone-ins that are such nightmares that
getting a recovery team in may be a major operation in and of itself.  If you
need to get corpses out of an unbroken Fear, well, you need a break team.
Hate is not "broken" but if you need to get corpses out of it you'll need a
group that can hold the portal area, at least.  The new CT has a pretty wicked
zone line.  Sleeper's required you to do Stupid Key Tricks before the key got
soulbound.  Veeshan's Peak is the only zone I've heard anyone discuss as
having serious corpse-eating potential, and I don't know how true that is any
more (if it ever was).
