The ruleset became quite ridiculous with anti-harrassment stuff, things
like you couldn't follow someone through a zone line and keep chasing
them on the other side and the such.

See I most definetly have been exploited more than most people. It got
to the point where it became normal for me to expect to get 3 draughts
incoming when I get ported into nektulos. I zone pretty slow so of
course I get fucked up at zonelines, no rules ever stopped that from
happening. Spamming with wands? Happens all the time.

What I got pissed about is the fact that the same people who bleat about
it being so unfair are the same who use it on me, because im a "pk" its
ok, obviously.
