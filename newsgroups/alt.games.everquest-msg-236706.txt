dang huge ass link.

Everquest Companion: The Inside Story (Consumer)
by Robert B. Marks 

is probably what you are thinking of.

"...this book offers a glimpse inside the game, offering a chance to
understand the history and some of the underlying issues of the game."

But I'm not sure if that is what the poster would want since, perusing
the book at Border's, it seemed to be more about the history of the
Everquest "GAME" rather of the in game world so much. Like it has lots
of interesting development tidbits.

Ah yeah, the blurb at barnes and noble sounds more like it:

"...You'll go behind the scenes to meet the game's creators, discover
their influences, see how the game was made, and learn what it takes
to run and maintain one of the world's most massive multiplayer online
role-playing games. Author Robert Marks conducted extensive interviews
with the designers, artists, and programmers to bring you this
insider's look. You'll also hear from the players themselves, visit an
EverQuest Fan Faire, and be entertained by the many amusing stories
that can only take place in this spell-binding reality. "
