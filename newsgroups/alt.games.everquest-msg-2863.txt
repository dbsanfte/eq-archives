you are still assuming that the fighters (or anyone else for that
matter) will assist. i think solo is the best, albiet slowest path to
level. its just that wizard will be tough to go it alone.

the problem is that the place to level for my locale (blueskin,
wizard, 9th level) is in east commonlands killing orcs. i also wanna
improve my faction so i can go through the intolerant human cities
without being killed. but to do this means that i have to be
incredible lucky enough to be the only person in EC at camp 1 or be
even luckier to wind up grouping with people who actually strategize
and help each other out.
