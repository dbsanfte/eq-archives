from my experience wow's 'ease of soloing' bites itself in the arse: since
it's totally playable solo, it's very hard to find groups cause majority of
players are doing just that. soloing. it's all fine if soloing is what you
need, but really: we're playin massively *multiplayer* games here.. eq2 has
lots of quests which require a group, but since everyone (around lv 20+ at
least..) is aware of that, people tend to group more easily also.

as for the thread starter: have you ever thought of joining a guild? there
are lots of them and not all require 8+ hours of gaming every day. I haven't
that much time to play either, but after finding a nice, easy going guild,
there's almost never a time when i can't get a group (or help for a
paticular quest even).
