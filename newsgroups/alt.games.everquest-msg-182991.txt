SLOWER??????? 

My god how slow could it get, slow advancement though the 50s already
run off more peeps from high end game that anyother reason. Ever
noticed how many 52 clerics there were and how few 60? Group xp is the
pits in the 50s. People just lose interest due to it.

Slower? No.... Faster YES!!!!
