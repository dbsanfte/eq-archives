My troll can trade with some of the merchants, after doing the quest for 
the trade federation once.

But there are more factions in the town. I cant remember the quest NPC 
names, but i got them from talking to one of the NPCs at the house you 
find Henry the Trade Commisioner in.
Those other quest NPCs are somewhere in one of the cluster of buildings 
just outside Henrys house. One give some quest near Katta (havent done 
it, so dont know if you have to to in, but trolls not exactly liked in 
Katta). The other give a simple delivery one, to a guy in Dawnshroud. Do 
that quest, and youll be able to trade with the rest of the merchants.
