Typically, you can run to N. Karana and port up to Nexus quicker than you
can wait for the boat and take the ride.  Not saying that this is the best
method for everyone, but I rather enjoy it.  Rather than sitting and waiting
for the boat, not to mention the long boat ride of losing playing time, I
can be playing and getting XP on the way to Spire, then port up when the
time comes.  Also...you get nice little reminders every few minutes of when
the portal is about to fire.  The boats give no warning whatsoever.

Just my two cp.
