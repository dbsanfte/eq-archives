Sorry, but I don't agree, and I have me, 98se, and xp running eq on my
network. Maybe in your case it makes a difference, I won't argue there, but
it certainly isn't worth doing for a novice that doesn't know how to format
a drive.

I won't bother stating specs and driver revisions for all my operating
systems and pc's, it really isn't the issue. When properly installed, me
runs fine, and will not make any noticeable difference to the average eq
player.
