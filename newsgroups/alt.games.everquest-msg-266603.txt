Yeah, this annoyed me a bit about WoW, too.  I'd complete a mission to
kill 10 Crimson Guard.  I get my reward, and notice the guard next to
me has a mission for me.  I tlak to him, and he tells me to...kill 10
Crimson Guard.

WTF ?  I WAS *JUST* THERE, you prick !

So he expects me to run BACK the way a I came ( a good 10-15 mins of
running, with fights along the way) just to kille another bunch of
people I'd already killed ?  The SAME 10, probably.

Pah - I went fishing, instead.
