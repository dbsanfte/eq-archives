Try the Alluring Sirens.  The respawn is about every 5 mins.  Once you break
the spawn, you will be able to fight, med, fight, med... With little wait
between med and spawn.  I took my necro from 12 to 15 on the Sirens in a
matter of 3 days (RL).  Was getting 1 1/2  bubbles an hour.  Collect the
scales, too.  Every once in a while a mage wanders along looking for them
for a quest.  I got about 40pp for 5 of them while there.
