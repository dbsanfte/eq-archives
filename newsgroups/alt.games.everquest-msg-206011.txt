I've never seen a casino where this would be a problem.  Are they
marketing via direct tells now?  Or commenting on people who walk nearby
without signing up, or on everyone in the zone that doesnt' elect to
play?  Since 99 out of 100 people won't play casinos, I find it hard to
believe you are being singled out for this treatment randomly, I certainly
have never recieved it in any zone, ever.

Or are -you- starting trouble by directly or in ooc making comments about
why you won't play?

I would not be at all surprised, if I shouted out to the zone "I'm not
playing your casino" (or something more detailed or rude) and got some
sort of snappy retort from the guy running it.  Sure, he's probably a
scamming jerk anyway, but I've yet to see one make unprovoked attacks on
random passerby's, probably because getting into flame wars isn't actually
good for "business"
