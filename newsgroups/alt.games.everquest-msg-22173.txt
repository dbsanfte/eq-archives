When my guild raided COM for a mage's epic (I think the piece needed drops off
of Ghiosk as well for mages), we had about 5 and a half groups of people. We
just kept moving up and killing stuff, until we got to Ghiosk, then pretty much
took him down with brute force. I do recall there were a lot of meleers and not
a huge amount of nukers...
