Woot!  There's some great info confirming that the higher of Stength,
Wisdom,
or Int will help on smithing, and that higher of Dex, Wis, Int help
with
fletching, jewelry crafting, and soon tailoring!

Yay!  My bard stopped tailoring a long time ago due to low
intelligence, but
now has the Luclin song that increase dexterity by about 85 points.
Dex base level is at 104 to begin with :)

As soon as they put this change in, she'll get buffed with a dex spell
from a shaman, and
sing her song and be well over 200 dex to do tailoring.  At least I
hope the
song stacks with shaman dex buffs.

And today I can also help my ranger wife with her fletching.
