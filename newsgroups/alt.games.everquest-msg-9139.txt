A guy tries to KS Quilmane from a friend of mine.

My friend had already done about half (questionable) had Quilmane rooted,
and sat down to med up a little bit to continue kiting.

Dumbass runs up and starts wailing on Quilmane.  My friend tells him that
he's got it, and no help needed.  Dumbass is clearly trying to KS.  So my
friend moves back in, and beats Quilmane apart (now assisted by the guiy who
had tried to KS).

Quilmane dies.  Dumbass tries to loot immediately (but fails because the
kill wasn't his).  Then demands the loot.

"No."

"I'll roll you for it."

"Uh, No."

So now I have a nice pair of fethered leggings that my friend gave me.
