One problem with Return Home, for a gnome, is that AkAnon is a long ways 
from anything I might want to do.  I've frequently skipped using it, 
despite the fact that it would be handy to shop and bank, because its 
too much trouble.

Yesterday, I was about to make that same decision; I was in OT but 
logging in could go to AkAnon or, nah, I'll just stay.  Just after 
hitting Enter World, though, it occurred to me; I can now Return Home, 
do my shopping, and then OT hammer to a central location, no more 
running Steamfont, LFay, GFay, BB, OOT, WFP, NRo just to start the day!

Logged in on the ship in OT, I wasn't paying much attention, talking to 
guild about what was happening... and I fell thru a hole in the deck.

Belowdecks in that ship, there are no exits, the only holes are in the 
middle of the cieling, and (at least for a gnome) jumping isn't enough 
to get you out.  Good news is, there's a Skeleton Worker up on the deck 
(bane, apparantly of any KOS people using the hammer); I tagged him with 
a spell, then whacked on him with the hammer till it procced me back up 
onto the deck.  Then I FD'd till the skellie forgot about me, and went 
on about my business.

As a side note, it took me appreciably longer than one whack, despite 
having all those raid buffs still on.  I was afraid the worker was going 
to die and leave me stuck down there!  I'd have FD'd first and let him 
regen hp, but I can see that its certainly not the most reliable form of 
transportation.

Later, I was down in TD near the raptors looking for the Scout (no luck) 
and then we headed for Seb.  I was most of the way up to the dock before 
I rememberd I had the hammer and could have just gated directly to OT by 
whacking one of the raptors with it.  This is going to take some getting 
used to.
