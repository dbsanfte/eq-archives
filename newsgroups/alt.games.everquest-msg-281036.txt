How many gamewide firsts have you accomplished?  Any?  I have a few, but not
many.  It's tough to beat every guild from *every* server to the punch.  I
have considerably more server firsts, but of course those are meaningless
when talking about not having any sort of spoilers at all.

I'll be glad to match my list up against yours.  I have a set, tried and
true method of dealing with unknown encounters, which has an incredibly good
track record for producing wins on the first try.  =)
