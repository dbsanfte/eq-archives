Necros have a pronounced weak spot in the low 30s. I gave up on
mine at 31. My wife almost gave up on hers in the low 30s also,
then she got Jboots and made it over the hump.

Druid soloing is easy, but becomes more and more tedious with
level due to ever-increasing med times. Necros have tools to
reduce that downtime.
