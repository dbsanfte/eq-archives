He said he uses snare/nuke, not root. . .

FWIW, in my experiences at level 29, Root Dotting anything over a blue
doesn't work well due to the mana burnrate on resists/early breaks on the
Roots (I've tried both types). For blues it's great but when the mobs start
resisting I just use Crud + Snare and med-kite if needed. Oh, and porcupine
a little to raise Defense. Snare+Nuke might work too but resists suck on
nukes, so I'd rather have slower kills with less downtime inbetween than
fast kills and 8 mins medding. In any case I suspect 143wis is a little low
for nuke kiting.
