Shows what you know.

Although its called NAV   - It detects and traps a lot more than Virii
- it also detects and blocks hijackers, trojans, diallers and loads of
other malware.

But you are correct - it will not necessarily trap all - which is why
I will not open it even if NAV does not detect. A tool like NAV does
not mean you can switch off your common sense.

Cheers
