Corpses can be looted in any order.  However, if your body has nothing on it, it
will vanish once its no longer rezable; is it possible the missing corpse was
naked?  Once upon a time they used to vanish in a very short time if naked, so we
all made a point of foraging something or killing a green mob to get some piece of
junk loot before doing a CR, so we'd have a rezable corpse that would stick around
till we recovered it.  Now the only danger of a naked corpse is that if you try to
loot it, discover its empty, when you click Done it will poof.  Possible to get
around that by waiting till you get "kicked off", about three minutes after you
start looting, but thats a real pain.

Typing /corpse, or using your hotkey, will tell you if you don't have any corpses
in the zone before you use up a charge of a rod.  If you know about where your
body should be, running back and forth in the area may well pull your body out for
you, it can be a hundred feet up in a tree or down under the world, right where it
"should" be from the X/Y location but not visible to you standing on top of it;
dragging your body will bring it to your level.  Saves a lot of trouble and
expense.  Its also possible for your body to be so stuck (deep inside a wall or
something) that its out of /corpse range, in which case your only recourses are a
high level necro and a bunch of cash spent on a coffin to summon it, or a
/petition to customer service and hope a GM will come get it for you (which he'll
do only if he verifies that it really is unrecoverable without a summon, not just
because its being guarded by dangerous mobs)

Dragging is the answer there, should have thought of telling you to try that
before the CBR.  Ah well, learning how to use the rod is a good thing anyway.
