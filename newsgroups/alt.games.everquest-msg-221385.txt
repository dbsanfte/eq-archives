1) I am guessing that he was not slowable also so similar to vindi except
less hit points?  If you were keeping your main tank up with out a CH cycle
and had enough mana to keep fast heals up then easier then vindi i would say
except for the dispelling factor.  He sounds like Vak Shyz the shade type
encounter.  Similar to maybe serverilous maybe a bit harder?

2) I'm guessing you weren't leading the raid.  That in and of itself is
usually a big enough factor to make people only want to raid occasionally
rather then non-stop.  Raids ARE fun but keeping things together is
sometimes worse then working at a regular job :p
