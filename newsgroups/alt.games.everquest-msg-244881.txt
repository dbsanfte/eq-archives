And it is changing hands, your client-side instructions don't get
carried over unless the game and server support the permanant change.
That Sony or any other companies give you limited ability to customize
non-critical properties of in-game objects through very select
modifications supported by the objects sitting on the server side and
dictated from instructions the client side does not make another copy
of the object, nor do they usually subsist when you transfer that item
to another person. The object will always exist in its entirety on the
server-side. Your instructions on your particular custom-mods...
non-critical properites of objects, i.e. a new graphic.. a new name...
will always exist on the client-side.

That you can write down a Swing instruction or Give Item This Picture
and include a picture in the letter still does not place the actual
object on the client side.
