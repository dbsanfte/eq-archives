You shouldn't even *need* to pray.  If there is a God, wouldn't he
already know how you feel, what you need, etc.?  Prayer is only
justifiable as a kind of self-therapy, imho; i.e., talking through
things might help you set things straight in your own mind.  But it
seems foolish to assume you need to talk to God - he *already knows*.

Taking it one step further, God *knows better than you*; i.e., it
seems pointless to ask God for things since he should theoretically
know better than you what you need.  All this assumes you believe
in God, of course.
