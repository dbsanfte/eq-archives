Nah - it went in a long time before any stress tests made those
necessary (and went through several iterations).  Blizzard has
maintained that they don't want leveling to be a chore and that
they want people to try multiple race/class combos.  This simply
aids in that.

Queues are actually a cure for being a victim of your own success.
250,000 units sold, 200,000 accounts made and 100,000 concurrent
users (in NA - this doesn't count Korea) on the first day.  Add 
that to the fact that the general channel on Silverhand has 
calmed down to what I expected from an RP server - and so far so
good.

As an aside, if Bob Perez happens to be reading this, your worries
about competition for quest mobs in crowded newbie zones were only
about half correct - the new spawn system Blizzard implemented late
in OB did a lot to help with that.
