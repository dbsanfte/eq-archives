We had a debate on our guild boards once a few months back, one of our
best warriors was talking with a dev about whether the ratio of 10 hp
to 1 AC that I guess Steelwarriors had suggested was fair. He was more
inclined to give weight to AC (some of his AHR loot probably had
something to do with that :-p ). I think he said after a point he
looked at the ratio more like 15 hp to 1 AC, raising the value of AC
in his opinion against hp. However, the dev said that if anything the
10x1 ratio was too kind to AC, and hinted the warriors should think in
terms of even higher ratios (more value to hp). When the warrior
debated his side more, the dev did say he knew the actual combat
formulas, but that the warrior could believe whatever he liked. :-)

The original poster should make sure every piece of gear they have has
hp on it. As long as they're using gear meant for a paladin, it should
have reasonable AC anyways.
