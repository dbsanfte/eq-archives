My guild is the same way.  Maybe 1/2 of us have PoP.  Its really caused
a lot of dissention as pre-pop we pretty much were just a raiding guild.
Then pop comes along and the raids slow to a trickle while people are
leveling, exploring, questing, tradeskilling, and trying to get
god-forsaken parchments.
