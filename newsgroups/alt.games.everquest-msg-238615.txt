   Now it looks like the developers have decided to open up trade skills to all
classes, through a process that seems very much like multi-classing (as I
understand it) in D&D.  Yeah, I know I probably don't understand the D&D very
well.  No, I don't want an in depth lesson in it.

   Anyways, what Moorgard basically says is that someone can be, for example, a
Cleric(40 level)/Scholar(19) if they choose.  Or one can focus primarily on
being an artisan.  One will still get exp for crafting stuff.  From the way I
read it, there will be two seperate pools for exp, one for adventuring, one for
crafting.

     And this gets a big "Yay!" for me.  Should also cut way into the numbers of
dedicated artisan alts.
