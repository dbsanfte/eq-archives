Wow, so many people missed the point.  He's a bad enchanter, and is
comfortable with that.

Solo'ing at that level is dangerous, slow and boring.  It can be done,
but it's really much more efficient to group with other people.

But rejoice!  There is a place for you even as a bad enchanter.  Join
a group in Lake of Ill Manners.  Buff the group, maybe debuff the mob.
 The group will usually have sow, so if the puller screws the pooch
and brings home too many critters, everyone probably has sow and you
can just run for the zone.

You can go from 16 to 20 fast fast fast with little to no fear of you
becoming better at being an enchanter. :-)
