37 Pally and 34 Cleric duo thinking about trying out TOFS.  Neither of us are
Uber.  Are we gonna have any success just the two of us?  I've heard that it's
very uncrowded and hard to pick up any group is this true?  Any tips or
suggestions for us?  We know nothing of the zone other than what we've read on
EQ Atlas but we'd like to see how far we can get.  Are CR's tough if we get
killed?  Thanks in Advance.
