Well I precede with caution no matter where I go when meeting new
things. But in terms of picking a race/class, it's hard to believe no
one has done a spreadsheet or the like listing where any given
race/class can expect to be KOS, in terms of cities or towns.  In this
I was most interested. Your reply did help though and I thank you for
it.

You wouldn't happen to kow what the damned line I need to add to my
client file is would you :-)  I had it setup from level 6 on my old
machine and would have kept ti, except when the faction messages
screwed up so did my log file. Really pissed me off. So I'd like to
start afresh from level 20  better then nothing I guess.
