NEVER underestimate the usefullness of RS3. There are very few people
who I would reccomend not bothering with RS3. The only examples I can
think of are unguilded, loner druids or shaman who spend all their time
in outdoor zones and never see the inside of a dungeon.

For anyone else, it's a usually great and occasionally life saving boon.
And the fact is, so many people get it as their first AA skill that (if
you ever go on raids in indoor zones) you can quickly get left behind if
you are the only one without it and there is any long run involved. 

We've also found situations where we've been able to escape certain
doom, "oh SHIT" situations grouping in dungeons. The dungeons were
(mostly) designed with mobs built around the fact that people wouldn't
be sow'd in there. Most dungeon mobs are very slow compared to a level 8
shaman SoW. Being able to just outrun them over some short distance can
occasionally save your ass.

Even outdoors, have you never had a time when your sow ran out *just* as
you were starting to run towards that far off zone line with your
intended victim(s) angrily chasing at your heals? No time to recast or
drink another sow potion.... you die. 

Having your base run speed increase like that is well worth the time and
effort needed to just get three AA points.
