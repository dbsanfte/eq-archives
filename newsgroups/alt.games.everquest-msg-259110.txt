I see someone else posted the link for the chart at eqbl...

My experiance with pet weapons to date is much like yours. I cant
really tell (or notice) any real difference giving my BL warder
weapons.

When I play my necro I definatly notice the difference in damage
by giving my pet weapons, but not the BL pet.
