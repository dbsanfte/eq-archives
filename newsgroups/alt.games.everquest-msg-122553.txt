I hope this means "no more ice comet from a loathing lich upstairs

That's fine...I have no beef with that.

FINALLY!!!  With a 100kpp horse, it was absurd to be hit by a level 30ish
Ry'Gorr
shaman's nuke in EW after you'd run 3/4 of the way past the zone and over
some hills.

Thank God!!! Being unable to interrupt a level 20 orc medic at level 53 is
just stupid.

See my post from the other day for how I felt about this.  A Dervish
Cutthroat
should NOT be able to "Drowsy" a level 60 player with 100+ resists in normal
gear.  Ever.

To be honest, I never knew that they did.  I just figured the game cheated
and made 'em hit for full damage a lot.

Again, about freaking time already.  Shardwurms should not have access
to a 50+ spell.  Pulling in good old Sol B should not be a death sentence
for a level 52 monk.  Watching a level >20ish necro in BEFALLEN Venom
of the Snake a level 51 druid friend two days ago earned a FAST /bug
report.  I admit it was probably an anomaly, but it happened.

Again, that's good.  Watching level 30ish recusos in M. Seru AoE heal
each other when faction farming at 60 is stupid.  Especially when your
level 55 paly buddy can't buy the spell for the price of his own right leg.
:-)

Again, I have no beef with NPC's being stronger than PC's in some respects,
even outright cheating in some cases (I rethought my issues with Vox...hell,
she's an "ancient" dragon...if she's a cleric, she might have trained
herself
in a few Wizard spells or even Shadowknight spells...heck, she IS a dragon),
but only in appropriate cases.  Every frog in Sebilis should NOT be
multi-classed,
but if Tormax wants to be King of the Giants because he melees like a
bastard
and all of the sudden learned wizard nukes and Gate, he IS a boss mob.
Just don't make "a frost giant berserker" start Deathtouching and having his
level 30 doggie pal casting "Judgement" on the puller...
