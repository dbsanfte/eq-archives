Never fought Trillcor, since some damn druid for League of Levity CS'ed him
from me.  I've taken Fireclaw many times, and it's not too bad for a level
50 Paladin with LoH up.  Never had a problem with pulling her, either.  Lead
off with my DD stun, and then Flame of Light, and she's on her way alone.
Granted, it's easy as hell to single pull there, which had me in stitches
when a level 45 monk asked for my help in clearing the room.
