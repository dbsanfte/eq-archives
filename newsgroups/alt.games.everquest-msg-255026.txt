No they didnt. About 2 weeks ago a group I was in wanted to do
chests after the addy and I started to make my way out. They
didnt wait for me to get completely out and everyone was poison
gassed. They were deep in the dungeon, and I was near the exit...
so they didnt change it. It still hits everyone in the dungeon.
