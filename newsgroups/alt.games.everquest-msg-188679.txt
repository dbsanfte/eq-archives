Blue mobs have a very wide range of levels, and it gets larger as you get
higher in level. A high-end db at level 12 might be 11 or maybe 10 (but
probably not), whereas a high-end db at 65 could be as low as 60 or maybe
even 59.

The message you get when you /consider is indicative of the relative level.
I forget the exact words, but the harder a mob sounds, the harder it
generally is.

red-con : what would you like your tombstone to say?
hard yellow : would mop the floor with you
easier yellow : looks like quite a gamble
white/even con : appears to be quite formidable
hard blue : looks kind of dangerous
easier blue : looks quite risky, but worth a try
not quite light blue : you would have the upper hand
light blue : you would probably win, but it's not certain
green : looks like a reasonably safe opponent
