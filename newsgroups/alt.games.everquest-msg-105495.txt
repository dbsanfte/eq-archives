Some nights are better than others, but once you find a steady group
of decent people (they do exist) it gets less and less a problem.

I hate bad groups as much as anyone. When they pull a number on me I
occasionally find myself soloing with my supposedly retired druid
(more likely my ranger though who is also capable of soloing). But
over the long haul, the speed of the dungeon group will eclipse the
soloer killing one at a time.
