I have a ranger friend who uses a bow and arrow combination with
range so high he cannot see his targets without a vision buff.  I managed
to do the same thing with a rogue twink, using a spyglass.  You -can-
see things you couldn't see at all before (as tiny little dots) and you can

also see the things that were barely visible before, more clearly.

Most classes don't have the capability to reach out and touch something
so far away that they need something like this to use their full
capability,
but it is possible.
