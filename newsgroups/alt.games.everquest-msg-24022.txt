Lets hope so. I must admit I hunt/farm in Runnyeye a lot but I also hand out
the Black alloy to newbies as well (when I can find a non twink that is)
I of course keep any decent items for Guild or sale but since, at 45, I am
normally the lowest in the zone I rarely get a shot in on these.
The only problem with the Warrens is that once there it's hard to get a port
out and a journey thru Erudin for an evil character can be a hazardous
journey (you don't gain faction with the paladins buy hunting in the
Warrens)
