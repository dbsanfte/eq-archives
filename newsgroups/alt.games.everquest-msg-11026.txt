If the mob's fixed path takes it through the building, you have a safe
spot now away from the building.  Or is your point that right now, you
have to watch the mob go by a couple of times to figure out that its
path always goes through the building, and so the safe spot is to the
side, but if they changed it, you'd know right away the building is
safe?

If that's the problem, just make the path go through the doorway.  There
are mobs whose path takes them through the walls of buildings when the
buildings have open doorways on both sides the mobs could go through.

Heck, they even have code in there to make mobs open doors.  Look at
some of the rats in Qeynos.

I think they were just sloppy and the people who did the mob paths did
not coordinate with the people who put in decorative buildings.
