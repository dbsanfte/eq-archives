   You know what's worse than being in a guild that is in the process of
imploding?  One that many of your friends have left, as of the
disaterous guild meeting last night?  One that you are most likely going
to leave because of the juvenile politics, leaving you guildless, in an
"mixed marriage" on a roleplaying server where such things matter to a
fairly high percentage of the population?

   Having a conversation via /tell with your guild leader about it.
Confronting him on why you are angry.  Typing /1 instead of /r.  Having
serverwide.age:age as your chat channel 1 because its the only channel
you have on autojoin.  Then doing the same mistake over and over again
in the course of the converstation.

   I feel like such a retard.

Annie <----  _Really_ knows how the "SONOFABITCH" guy felt.
