I agree with 42.

The same thing happened to me in April.  I decided I was done on April 17th.
My account was billed on April 14 for three more months.  So I decided to
give it one last fling, to see if the interest I had could be rekindled (I
was somewhat like you describe yourself ... totally apathetic to signing
on).

After a month of trying to forcefeed myself EQ, I canceled my account.  It
went away this Monday.  If I hadn't have done it at the time I decided I was
done, I may well have gone on with "One more try" indefinitely.

So my suggestion would be that if you truly believe you're done, go ahead
and cancel now.  You'll still have access to your account until the term
expires, so you'll have plenty of time to say your goodbyes.  And you can
always reverse it if you change your mind in the intervening six months.

FWIW :-)
