Have you gotten the Scares of Velious expansion? I cannot say for sure as I
don't own it, but many people insist it is worth the $15-20 for the
interface improvements alone. It might be worth the expense for you based on
what is noted below ...

Well, it is clearly and explicitly against the rules. Verant has pulled
accounts for using it. It is, as one fellow on this newsgroup might say,
"using your existence outside the game to benefit your in-game existence." I
mean, isn't that using something outside of the basics the game gave you to
give an advantage to your character?  ;-)

But that being said - I'm not overly concerned about people using it until
it begins to be used for genuine cheating, like duping and such - Verant's
position is pretty much set in stone on EQMacros and other such utilities.

They say, for instance:

"EverQuest runs in full screen mode and doesn't allow task switching in
order to deter the use of third party software that may be used to modify
EverQuest gameplay."

Clearly, EQMacros does just this.

"You will not attempt to interfere with, hack into, or decipher any
transmissions to or from the servers running EverQuest."

Again, this is clearly what EQMacros does.

"You will not create, use or provide any server emulator or other site where
EverQuest may be played, and you will not post or distribute any utilities,
emulators or other software tools related to EverQuest without the express
written permission of Sony Computer Entertainment America."

And again. (all taken from the official site) On the boards, they have often
taken a strong stance on EQMacros. If I recall correctly, and I could be
wrong, I think the creator even got a cease and desist letter from their
attorneys once.

So I think Taras' point was, it is very surprising that a guy who spewed
such venom about twinking and cheating would be all for using a utility that
is, in fact, not only widely considered cheating by players, but is openly
opposed by Verant, is clearly considered cheating by Verant, violates the
rules and EULA, and circumvents basic gameplay mechanics to improve your
chances at the game. Sort of like twinking. But this really is against the
rules.

So you either have a split personality or genuinely were not aware of
Verant's stance, which has been pretty firm in the past. I am assuming it is
the latter.

Doesn't matter to me if you use it ... but you might want to be aware of
what Verant's stance is, since you pay them to play.
