While I understand generally what you are saying, I don't follow this
particular item.  If I've set up a workshop electrical system, I don't
go around and plug in every tool and turn them all on at once, then turn
the power on to the shop; I start with no load at all and turn things on
one at a time, if they all work then I eventually go around to the point
where everything is on at the same time and I'm deliberately trying to
crash the system... but I don't start that way.

Why must you have everything on at once?  Beta is a testing phase, I
don't see the point in insisting on having everything running, in fact,
even if you have everything ready, I'd start with the least I could, and
add stuff in till it breaks.

Of course, that isn't properly beta testing, its alpha testing... but I
don't think its the same thing as going back to phase II... at worst, by 
your description, its going back to phase III instead of IV.

Trouble is, EQ (and I assume EQ2) aren't designed on this sort of plan 
at all.  They are intended to evolve, constantly adding in new quests, 
new zones, new classes, new abilities.  Does EQ now resemble EQ at beta? 
  Not much.  Nor, I expect, will EQ2 five years from now.  During beta 
especially, I expect rapid changes taking place as they get things 
finished or find that in "real world" environment some things aren't 
ready for prime time, or at a minimum need to be adjusted.

This doesn't make sense to me either.   Beta, it seems to me, is the 
place to test things out to see how they work with real players.  If 
there are unintended consequences (and there almost certainly will be, 
programmers generally make horrible game testers) then now is the time 
to play around and see if you can fix them.  Killing beta and going back 
to a relatively clean slate is a drastic step at this stage, where the 
code more or less works but the vision itself and the design ideas that 
went into it are being tested.

Here I agree with you, sort of.  I don't have any problem with them 
adding features during beta (after all, they will, I expect, be adding 
them for years to come, and I don't want to wait 5 years for a game to 
be released).  But I don't see why, in addition to running an ongoing 
updating beta, they don't have an ongoing updating alpha version, and do 
simple tests like this before adding a feature to the beta.

DAOC?  Nobody is turning to that, if they want to play that they already 
are.  WoW is a concern, but its such a huge concern that they have to 
balance "not ready yet" against "we need to time things like so in order 
to compete against WoW".  12 months from Vanguard etc isn't a concern, 
if EQ2's rollout is a little sloppy it almost certainly won't be 12 
months worth of sloppy, in fact, I imagine they are busy planning an 
expansion to be timed to keep EQ2 alive when Vanguard releases.

EQ2's principle competition, as far as I can see, is EQ, with WoW a 
strong potential second place.

This is certainly not part of the EQ/EQ2 model.  Go live, thats when the 
fit really hits the shan.  Instead of 30,000 people in your beta test, 
you've got 300,000, including many who've never played a MMOG before and 
thus will be thinking of stuff so outlandishly stupid that none of your 
alpha/beta team dreamed of trying it, and many who are there to grief, 
and many who are immediately looking for get rich schemes so they can 
sell the plat for real cash and... well, lots of every stripe, nothing 
like the relatively well behaved and predictable beta players.

Further, you've already got your eye on expansion 1, maybe even 
expansion 2; these things take time to put together, and yet they help a 
MMOG game so tremendously that you have to keep putting them out there. 
  Its likely that the first EQ2 expansion is already planned and in the 
process of being coded.
