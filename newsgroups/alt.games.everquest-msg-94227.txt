Well just go to Oasis and auction 'WTB Sands of Ro' - that's all you need 
apart from shop-bought stuff. Drops off sand giants, and can sometimes be 
found on vendors there (looks like a bag of sap). Any bored high levels 
there killing the sand-giants are probably not there to farm Sands of Ro 
(or even to kill sand giants - usually they just spot one while waiting for 
the raft etc), and will often just give it to you.

It is possible to solo an SG at 31, but I wouldn't recommend attempting it 
with your current lack of gear (and hence small mana pool).

Hmm, just thought, you may be the right level to go xp on owlbears in the 
caves in hollowshade - no idea really, they were green to me when SoL came 
out and I've not been there with a lower level alt. Anyway, one named 
owlbear drops a nice 4 WIS range slot item with some AC and mana and stuff, 
a preserved owlbear eye. Good luck getting it to drop though...
