What really is starting to irk me is friends who refuse to accept an item
that I won a roll on but want to give to them.  I like rolling...it just
satisfies some weird gambling urge I have.  But I also like giving things
to friends. I swear, I have gotten into ARGUMENTS and almost "broken
up" with some friends because they wouldn't let me give them something for
free.  

Not to say I don't have my greedy moments.  If a friend had tried to roll
against me on, say, Sally, I would have ripped their eyeballs out.
