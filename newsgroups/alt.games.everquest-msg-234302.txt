I disagree. The skill set that makes for a good soloer overlaps the skill
set that makes for a good grouper, but is not the same. Agro management,
for example, is barely relevant for most soloers, but it's *crucial* in a
group. Ditching agro (DA/Jolt/Evade), stealing agro, pet mezzing, offtanking,
backstabbing, standing still to let the warrior taunt a mob off you, looting
policies, minimizing group downtime, learning other classes' strengths,
trusting other players to do their job, eating a death for the team --
these are typically not skills a strict soloer will even dream of, let
alone practice.

[It works both ways, too. A necro who only groups is much less likely to
have practiced fear kiting, for example, than one who has extensively
soloed.]

The most extreme example: a soloing wizard learns to root-nuke until about
34, then adds quad-kiting to his repertoire. He only fights in wide open
outdoor zones. His strategies for ditching unwanted agro when he's got a
couple mobs beating on him involve Gate, Fade, and running for zone. He
blows his mana bar down to 40percent or so on each mob and then does the
crossword puzzle while he meds up to full in a quiet spot. These are all
well-proven and laudable strategies for a soloing wizard. And they will
get you booted from your average xp group.

Apples and oranges. You'll learn little in PC whether you're grouping *or*
soloing, the xp flies by so quickly. All other things being equal, same
gear, same /played time, same level, same hunting grounds, etc, I'm
much less likely to have to explain simple grouping concepts to someone.
