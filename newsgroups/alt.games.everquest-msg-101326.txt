This is a bad rumor with a grain of truth.

Fungi prices haven't increased because they're going to be
made  NO DROP, they're getting more expensive because
the guy isn't dropping 'em like he used to.  They're still in the
game, still sellable, still usable on level 1 characters.

They're just worth more because they've gone from a
rare drop to an ULTRA-rare drop.

As a result, Ceremonial Iksar BP's have increased in
price, too.
