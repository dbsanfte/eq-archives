I was thinking the same thing.  First time I tried exploring Kerra Ridge
(you know, that zone were no one ever goes to?)... I used a good Erudite
(paladin), and was immediately KOS.  Tried a Barbarian rogue next, and met
with much better success...apprehensive at worst.

Me thinks some Erudites may have severe difficulties getting around Luclin
in one piece, as well......
