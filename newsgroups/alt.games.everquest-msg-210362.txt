If you can take the dillos, I don't think taking the frogs in a
straight up fight would be too difficult. The half that mitigate slow
don't hit all that hard from what I recall. 

Other spot I can think of is the golem camps in PoV badlands, static
spawns right outside the castle. I don't think I'd pull the desert
itself though, I can't pull that place w/o picking up adds. Those
spiders are hard to see and damn they hit hard! I'd stay out of CoD,
too many roamers and tight corners to pull singles reliably imo. ...
and even if you do, you'll eventually get a corrupted that's
unslowable. 

If you want to agro kite, orgres in Tactics or HoH (graveyard) seems
to work well for people and if you know what you're doing you should
be able to kite in HoH without training anyone. I've seen 3 or 4
groups agro kiting there w/o causing problems.
