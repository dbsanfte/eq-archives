Twisting like the previous poster stated is essential to a bard. I can now
twist 4 songs easily when theres little lag and a good connection. Once in a
while when soloing I can even get 5 songs..but thats not to often.
Definitely bookmark EQDiva as I used this site constantly and it will tell
you what songs stack with others and where to buy each song as well.
Good Luck!!
