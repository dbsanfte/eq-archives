He was talking about NR, not Moonfire.

And they'd damned well not expect me to heal them up so they can get
to FM and me to OOM. Now, if we were talking about a mage modrodding
in order to make more rods, that's a different matter, but as long as
I can never do the canni/torpor trick myself, things would have to be
pretty damned hairy before I'd heal a canning shaman. (Saving them
from the stupidity of low health aggro comes somewhat in under that)
