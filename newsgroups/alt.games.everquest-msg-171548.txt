I don't know about that. As I said, the first time I saw her, she
attacked me from behind when I was standing at the zone line facing
out into MM. I suppose it's possible she move past me to attack from
behind, but unlikely.

I also suppose it's possible that she merely ran out of sight of my

Maybe, but it sure didn't seem like anyone trained her. I wasn't in a
position to see it all though.

Btw, I don't recall seeing any DEs in EC lately. Did you mean WC and
