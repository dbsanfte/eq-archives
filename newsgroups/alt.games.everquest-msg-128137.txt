    Just a little thought, hmm? So why aren't all the big mobs with the best
loot being killed by everyone, again?

    There's an irregular zone edge, which (in places) could be used to send
people sideways into the zone. There's also the water, which has no pattern
relative to the shore except around the frog city (which is itself a
landmark). Getting to a specific loc inside the zone based on directions off
these would be an exercise in futility. If you really want to demonstrate to
me that this isn't so, give directions based on landmarks to the groundspawn
piece of the VP key that is there. If you need a /loc for that (snicker),
it's available at Allakhazam's under the listing for the quest.

    Have you died in any of these zones? Have you ventured off into the
middle of these zones, ever, or have you stayed close to the camp/zone/zone
wall you were at?

    Maybe you don't go to the middle of nowhere because, shockingly, there's
nothing there. Until some wingnut at VI decides that would be the perfect
place for a ground spawn.

    And you miss my point. The best games are easy to play, and difficult to
play well. The challenge comes not from the user interface, but from the
strategy. The canonical example is chess - doesn't take much to learn how to
move those pieces, but it takes significant brain power to know how to win,
consistently. Games like this become popular, and stay popular, because they
provide challenge to the dedicated player while being easy enough to play to
entice new players. Another recent example, in my opinion, would be Magic:
the Gathering (although the popularity there was also bolstered by a
collectability issue).

    There's limited appeal because nobody wants to waste their time learning
how to play a game which may or may not appeal to them once they get to know
it better. The lower the "entry cost" is for a game, the more likely it is
someone will want to spend time learning it as opposed to spending that time
on another pursuit.
