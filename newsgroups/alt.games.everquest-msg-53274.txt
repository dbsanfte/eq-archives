Personally, I would like to just once feel like I existed for a reason other
than to just kill, level, get better equip....while toys are nice, decent
exp for participating could be just as rewarding...like maybe a whole yellow
bubble for roleplaying properly or responding properly (like not killing
everything that moves).  Maybe defending freeport against an invasion of
VARIOUS size mobs, not just uber mobs, etc.  It's not really hard to come up
with ideas...look at all the roleplay computer games out there and the
myriad battles/quests within them...people buy them for a reason!
