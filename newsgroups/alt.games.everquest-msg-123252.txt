I get the feeling that selection process for Guides is way easier than it
used to be...


[Thu May 02 02:50:32 2002] You petition, 'Baxtabb just tried to Pickpocket
my SandGiant in Oasis... problem solved when I rooted it and it killed him,
this is just for the records when he tries it on someone else'

...Baxtabb was a lvl 14 Barb Rogue, so I doubt he'd have got anything
anyway, but the day before I'd had a dorf run up to 2 of my SGs and I looted
only silver/copper from both... so I was getting kinda pissed off...

[Thu May 02 02:55:42 2002] Eronion tells you, 'Greetings. Guide Eronion
here. Pickpocketing has no effect on the amount of money you loot from a
mob. :)'
