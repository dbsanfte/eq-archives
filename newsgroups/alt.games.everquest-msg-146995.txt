You will not evade me, Ed Jensen <ejensen@visi.com>:

You need to put one point into every skill you weren't born with,
meaning you'll have to put a point into dodge when you get it, into
tracking when you get it, into specializations when you get those (put
one point into all 5 and make sure to get your desired one to 50
first, as you can never pass 50 unless you've trained all of them).
You also have to put one point into channeling (my baby paladin seems
messed up - when she got channeling, I didn't put points in it and it
started rising from a skill of 27. My baby druid, otoh, had to train
the basics of channeling at level 4.).
