No, the question isn't "what can my class do" its "what can my class do
that the others can't" or even "what can it do that others can't do better?"

For example, whats better, the druid DS or the mage DS?  If it happens
to be the mage's today, then your druid's ability to cast a lesser one is
suddenly absolutely useless.  Only one caster in an entire raid is needed
to slap a DS on the MA, and its the one with the best DS.  Even if you
don't have a mage along with a better DS, there's only need for one
druid to do this job.

Another way to look at it is "what can my class do that isn't usually taken
care of by a class that -is- desired on a raid?"  Snare isn't that job...
rangers (who do more melee damage) wizards (who do more nuke damage)
and even necromancers (who were hauled along primarily as mana
generation devices) SK (capable of SA tanking quite happily) and Bards
(here's the versatility that you've been claiming for druids) can all snare
well enough to stop runners, which is what snares are for in raids.

I like druids.  Some of my best friends are druids.  One of my alts is a
druid.  I hardly go anywhere without a druid.  But I gotta tell you,
raids aren't clamoring for them, heck -groups- aren't clamoring for them,
and even I would be just as happy most times to have a wizard along,
(I'm a big fan of having one or the other Port class if possible) if it
wasn't for personalities.  Which of course goes back to the "its not what
your class can do, its what -you- can do and how much fun you are to
group with that really matters" arguement, which isn't really germane to
a discussion of class balance.
