Yes

Note also, how there is no mention of" taste in
clothing".

Yes

Perhaps by someone whose knowledge of gay culture
and behaviour is severely limited.

You do know the difference between transvestitism
and homosexuality, don't you?

You would also know that most transvestites are
not gay, wouldn't you?

Yes

They aren't, at least nowhere in the world as far
as I am aware.

If someone is attacked because they are gay, then
their clothing is irrelevant.

Make your mind up, is he being attacked because he
belongs to a group, ie homosexuals, which is a
hate crime, or is he being attacked because of the
clothes he is wearing, which is not a hate crime.
