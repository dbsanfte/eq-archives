Depends on what you mean by equal.  Necros can kill more, and faster,
solo than druids can, and with less downtime.  Druids can solo pretty
freaking good, but we just don't quite compare to Necros in shear
power.

On the plus side, druids are viewed as better for a group than necros.
This isn't necessarily always true, but it is the perception.  A well
played necro is a huge boon to a group.
