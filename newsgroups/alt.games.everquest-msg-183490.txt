    Now, I haven't played a monk, but your above example is likely to go the
monk's way, because stipulating that the SK can't cast is a bit like saying
the monk can't use mend.

    Either would probably partner very well with a shaman but my guess goes
to the SK because shaman duoing with either class means tanking and the
shaman adds a lot of DPS on his own meaning the SK's lesser dps are less of
an issue.
