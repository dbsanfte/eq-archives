Granted. I just don't think you can say you've given it a year's chance 
with only a level 4 and level 7 character to show for it. You're not even 
*able* to experience much more than poking things with a sharp stick at 
those levels.

It's no secret how immersie and captivating EQ can be if you give it a 
chance.
