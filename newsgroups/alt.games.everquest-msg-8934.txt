Anything bad... and I mean Anything that used to bother my girlfriend about
me, she blaimed it on me playing Everquest too much.  Dishes not done, yep
you guessed it, it was because I spent too much time EQ.  Tired today at
work, yep you guessed it, it was because I stayed up too late playing EQ.

But now that I hooked her on EQ, I notice how the other side feels and I
understand why it upset her.  It's annoying as hell when it's a perfect day
outside and my girlfriend wants to stay in and play EQ.  But I used to do
the same damm thing and I thought I was doing nothing wrong.  Oh well, what
goes around comes around.

Although, when she says she was tired today at work, she doesn't think it's
all that funny when I say "What's the matter honey, stay up too late playing
Everquest!"  Even though she used to say the same thing to me.  hehe
