Have you seen how much it costs to repaint a bumper? :-P

Anytime you run something (or someone) over you take a little damage.

In PS you have to constantly keep your head on a swivel. I read about
one guy who got grief points when his orbital drop pod landed on a
friendly. Talk about wrong place at the wrong time..splat! In another
incident a completely loaded drop ship (10 players, equipment and a
vehicle) was obliterated before it could take off when another
accidentally crashed into it.

I agree the game needs a lot of tweeks, but overall it is amazingly
fun and challenging.
