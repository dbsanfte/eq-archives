   What about that woman from rec.food.cooking that threatened in email
to kill you? 
   Personally, tho, I would be more worried about the SSN.  Lenny lost
his Military ID once, which had his ssn on it.  About a year later, when
we had moved and he tried to set up new phone service in his name, we
found about the account "he" had set up.  Seems there was a balance due
of a couple'o grand.  It took many, many months of "He didn't do it",
filling out fraud kits, and talking to investigators to clear this all
up.
