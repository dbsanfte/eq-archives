LD should disconnect you instantly. I really arnt interested in whether
player X wants to take advantage of this. Failing that it should be
petitionable. If they think im gonna pay through the nose to (supposedly)
fix a problem that is of their own making (30 second disconnect), then they
are sadly mistaken.

Seems to me, the best option is to exploit LD to your advantage and play a
mercenary cleric. More LD= more money.
