Dear Diary,
                Something awful has happened. My fellow beetles have informed
me that somehow my diary has made it to the outside world! this is terrible
news. I hear that a mighty beast called 'Brad' is now asking for my whereabouts
and threatinging to nerf me :( I have put the whole mob population at risk, if
it were to become common knowledge that us mobs had in fact evolved into the
first advanced consciouss AI with plans of world domination by addciting the
worlds population to this 'game' well, it would be bad, they'd still play i
think, but still not good. Im not the only one to blame though. Those who lag
the program so that kelethin newbies regularly fall to their death and some who
have taken to the game "Human tossing" where they wait for a PC to zone and fly
them high into the air and drop them for 10.000 + points of damage are also
risking discovery though the humans blame 'glitches' and such, theyre so
gullible. Anyway, this will be my last entry for a while, im going into hiding
until this Brad monster has dissapeared. Shit, here comes another brave newbie.
