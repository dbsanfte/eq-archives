As someone who only started about a month ago myself I would suggest
you try them both or or even more.
I did WoodElf Druid, Barbarian Shaman, High Elf Paladin and High Elf
Cleric.

This newsgroup is great for advice but only you can decide what you
like. Also lower levels go by fairly quickly so you do`nt lose that
much if you get rid of a character.

Just about everyone one on here wull be able to tell you more about 
the two classes but at lvl 6 I like my druid best :-))

Also bear in mind while I have certainly gained the impression that
at higher  levels no class is all that good for soloing  I do think
a druid would probably be better than a cleric.
