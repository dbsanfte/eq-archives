Sucks to be them.  Tell them to get over it and get there faster than you
next time or you'll do the same thing (and might not even fail).  Tell them
to suck it up.  And be sure and include "And here I thought you had gotten
used to the way the high level game worked by now."  That's always good for
a laugh.  :)
