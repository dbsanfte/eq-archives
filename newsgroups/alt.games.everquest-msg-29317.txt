In EQ you can have as many spells as you can *afford* and are of a suitable
level to use.  You get new, more powerful spells every four or five levels
(roughly). You can buy all the spells whenevery you want, and have the money,
but you won't be able to scribe them into your spell book, memorize them, or
cast them until you reach the minimum level for that spell.  You can have up to
eight spells memorized at any given time.  To use a different one, you'll have
to "forget" one of the eight and memorize the new one.  When you die, you
"forget" all your eight memorized spells and have to mem them again before you
can cast. You normally start your brand new first level caster with two "newbie"
spells that the game gives you for free to start with. The rest you have to save
up money and buy, or research (later on) or quest for (much later on.)
  When you die, you do not "lose everything".  However, you return to your "bind
point" and respawn there with none of your stuff on you. It's all still on your
corpse, so you have to go travel to where you died and loot all the stuff off
your corpse. (Unless of course, you get a rez from a high level cleric, in which
case you will just appear at your corpse so you can start looting it.)  Death
will also cost you an annoying amount of your experience points for that level,
particularly at higher levels. Again, a high level cleric rezzing you can cut
down on that painful experience loss.
