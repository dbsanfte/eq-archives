Hmmm See this is what FFXI did and why I find it not boring as hell... well
there is no CR, but the death penalty is pretty steep none the less. The
game is challenging... without being instant death. Travel is dangerous. The
world is huge at the speed you travel. Even the boats are dangerous (I got
killed by pirates). The only way to travel faster is by Port (similar to
velious circles, you have to go there first and get a key item to be able to
be ported there), being gated to bind, 'blood gating' (change job level 1,
go pick a fight), riding a boat, riding the airship, which is not an option
till you are in your 30-40s, as it requires a pass you get for gaining rank
5, or can buy for a measly 1 million Gil... That's a lot of gil, btw, or
riding a choboco, which is an ostrich that is transport that is a cross
between EQ's and DAoC's horses: You can't fight from it, when you get off it
it disappears, but you can control where it goes. Also it only lasts a
limited time. You must be 15th level to ride, and must reach 20th to be able
to get a choboco license.

It does. See SWG for months before they put decay in and reinstated
insurance. Heck, see SWG even now. Insurance is cheap, and decay is rather
pathetic except where it eats away your highly valuable tools.
When you had to run halfway across Tat after a death, even if you didn't
care to go back there, it was much more challenging. Big critter fights in
SWG today are 'keep the doc backed off a bit and zerg it'.

Hmm isn't 'There' big on real estate and personal creations?
I'm still not completely sold on instanced zones being the only way to go.
Yes yes, it makes all the jerks go away, but part of the game is when 3
people have been soloing an hour and decide to make a party, and competeing
with others for spawns. Yes at times it's frustrating but...

well we shall see.

Thing I hate the most about Final Fantasy. Everyone looks the same.  There
are exactly 16 different Mithra. From a distance every Mithra monk looks
just like me, until they get over the 30-40th level area and start getting
distinctive gear.  I expect to upgrade my body slot at 24, and not change
till 39th. My pants are good till 35.  Gloves and shoes don't change
appearances much. My head item is a headband that my bangs cover... that
won't change for another 10 levels either.

The biggest problem, imho, with the SWG system was not the flexibilty, but
the ease of swapping around. I mastered Smuggler, Artisan, Bio Engineer,
Droid Engineer, Bounty Hunter, Pistoleer, Carbineer, Medic, Scout,
Entertainer, and Marksman. Bounty hunter, mastered pretty much from scratch
(requiring mastering both marksman and scout), which is probably one of the
top 5 toughest professions to master, took me 7 playing days (not 24x7
hours, but 7x 3-5 hour nights.. they were scattered over about 3 weeks
though)
I really really like the Final fantasy system.. though even it needs some
improvement.
You can have two jobs (main job and support job). Support job acts at a
maximum of half the level of the main job. Only the main job gets
experience. At any time by going to home, you can switch to any job you
qualify for. (advanced jobs are 'unlocked' with quests).  I am currently an
11 warrior/ 5 monk. Monday when our group gets together I will be a 21
Monk/10 Warrior... I've also got 11 levels of Thief, 10 of Red mage, 4 of
white mage, and am a level 1 black mage. There are no experience penalties
for any of this swapping around. But leveling the jobs is hard on par with
(or perhaps beyond) EQ pre-kunark.
