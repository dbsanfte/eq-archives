What I think fucked EQ, in no particular order:

1) maps. Shut up and admit it, this game's immersion factor went to shit
when everyone started running around staring at a big grey map with a
flashing you-are-here sign instead of the actual scenery looking for
landmarks. May's well play pacman...

2) Content restriction. New expansions totally fucked the value of old
quests. New quests with new expansions consist almost solely of grinding
and/or aren't worth doing. Travel/exploring was erased by maps. Tradeskills
died in PoP (yes I know PoP added lots of recipes but look at the MARKET).
That leaves grinding, and from LDoN onwards grinding was time limited,
high-stress, zero time to interact with people except with HOTBUTTONS, etc.

3) Travel... There is now absolutely ZERO value in having been able to GET
somewhere, except for keyed places. (grinding, not travelling).

4) A combination of all the above: The conversion of EQ from EQ into a Video
Game. Yes there was a LOT wrong with the EQ concept and it needed work, but
instead of expanding on it, Sony have collapsed every facet down into a
basic medieval FPS.
