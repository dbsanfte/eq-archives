Few of my personal picks lol:
Srg. Slate... boy did he ever cause me nightmares when ec was the bazaar
zone!!

Air elementals in ec from newbie days, I still smack them when i get a
chance just for the hassle they gave me when i was a wee one lol

Cazel... bastige!

Bixie's... all over... demeted buggers still drive me nuts, not like they
are a real threat but they still have a lust for my blood and seem to have a
radar for whenever I afk in any zone they are in. Fear the bixie spam!
