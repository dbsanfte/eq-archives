That is a bit of a large first step. Basically find someone who has been
there before, and never leave that person's side. Wandering will get you
(and many others) killed. As a cleric, there really isn't all that much to
know...heal whoever is low on hitpoints. If this is your first time in a
dungeon, I'd recommend not nuking at all, the risk of hitting something
mezzed and killing an enchanter and yourself is too high.
