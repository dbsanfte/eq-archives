I would say AC is the thing you should concentrate on.  STR is very
important in the lower levels for damage output but when you get higher
becomes less and less important.

Velium, yes.I haven't played for 3 months but that was the best common item
to buy then .  I'm quite sure it is still so.

You can't make macros to change gear, but to sit and so other stuff -yes.
You woule be better off finding this info on a site as EQvault

They are very group dependent and have a hard time travelling and so on in
the early years, can be frustrating because you get killed more often and so
on.(buy a lot of SOW potions)  Having played a ranger close to level 52 I
would say warriors have a tough time in the early years.
(My ranger was very hard to kill with both sow and snare)
 but after level 50 they are the kings of melee, they are the best of
absorbing damage which is so very important when fighting dragons and stuff.
I would recommend anyone that want to play his character to level 60 and be
melee to choose a warrior but if they want a bit easier path and still want
to go melee I would choose Shadowknight.

In fact, looking back, I'd say the powergamers way to EQ would be to make a
druid or necro to earn some money and level fast. Then go back, make a
warrior and buy nice gear for him with the money you got, He will then level
twice as fast as if you initially made the warrior.
If you make a druid you can make some money on SOW and ports too.
