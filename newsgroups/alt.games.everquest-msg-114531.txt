Which is exactly how I look at it. Random sucks but everything else tends to
suck worse. Random also has the benefit of being very easy to do and fairly
fast. If you need before greed then you will end up with only people who
need something showing up. If you have nice seniority lists only the most
senior members will show up. If you have officer decided loot than the ones
the officer favors will be happy and the ones getting shit on wont be.

In the end it really does even itself out while always keeping up good
incentive to raid. The only times it gets messy is when non no drop very
valuable stuff drops. For these instances I sorta advocate officers deciding
even though officers seem to get very rich this way :)
