 I am playing EQ on a PIII850 Asus 440BX/ 762MB PC133/ Voodoo5. I had the
same problem until I wacked the partition and allowed WIN to use all the mem
it wants. I also use a cool lil' tool called "memcleaner" that clears all
the built up cache that WIN claims it cleans, but don't.
 I don't remember the site I D/L the progz from, but I would be glad to
attach it if you think it will work :-)
