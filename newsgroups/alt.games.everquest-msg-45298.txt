It hasen't affected anything. For the first few months of EQ Hacker's 
Realm there was no block, for a while I got about 400 unique visitors a 
day. I started the block, nothing has changed. If some haven't come back 
, well then good. At least they just stop visiting it on move on, unlike 
most of you whiney bastards :(
