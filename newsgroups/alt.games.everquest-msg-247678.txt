Just wondering, in your original post, you said you were in the throne
room fighting a mob when the low-level players came in.  Did they
actually start attacking the mob you were fighting?  (I think you just
said that they "without as much as a 'hello' start killing stuff").
Or did they start fighting other mobs in the area that you were not
fighting?
