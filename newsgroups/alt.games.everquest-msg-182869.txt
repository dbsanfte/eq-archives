I really don't think SOE/VI care about this too much anymore. They wont earn
any money on a closed account, but they do earn money on someone buying and
reopening an account. When EQ was really hot and they had most of the
market, yes then they could be tough, but these days they have to compete to
stay in business and now they are forced to play by the free market rules,
and those rules are set by us folks who buy their product.

The only thing that they will achieve by banning accounts on a scale like
this is loss of money and loss of players online, and SOE/VI knows it.

Why else do you think they suddenly started allowing name changes. Not to
mention character transfers, account transfers, server transfers. All these
services are aimed at the EBAY'er.
....all this when they removed the "players online" numbers and when other
competing products started popping up on the market. Coincidence? :-)
