I'm starting to rethink my position on charm.  Before, it seemed like it
would always break too soon.  But lately it's been lasting a LOT longer.  As
in several minutes longer.

It may be my higher level (57), or that my CHA is getting better (205), but
it's getting into the low end of the reliable range.  I keep meaning to head
to The Grey and really try it out.
