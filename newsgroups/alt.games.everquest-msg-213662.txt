I have solo'd a Druid to level 50 plan to make it as high as I can.  The only
"help" I get is that I have a mage summon no rent weightless bags to drop to my
druid so I can go hunt for hours and fill my bags up without having to bank or
sell.  I like the self sufficiency of my druid since I can run the Stein of
Moggok quest at will (after wolf form and faction adjustment with clurg)
nabbing 200 pp a shot for cash, a druid can really run that quest much faster
than a chanter, even with the new PoK ports.

The best reason that I have for playing my solo druid (as opposed to my solo
level 40 Mage) more is that I just love to kite.  Find some good open ground,
SoW yourself and kill some giants (starting at level 20 or so in Warslick
Woods)...snare, dot, dot, run, nuke, med, run, nuke....til dead....rinse and
repeat...
