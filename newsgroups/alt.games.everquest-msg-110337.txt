Hmm, see, reading auctions I vastly prefer 1 item to a line -
It's far easier to browse as they go by than one long line
listing many items.

I usually hotkey up the items I have to sell - tap it ONCE,
then read the other auctions for a few minutes, then tap
it again.

When I'm soloing, and reading the market channel I usually
tap the hotkey once at the beginning of downtime.  So maybe
once every 7-8 minutes.
