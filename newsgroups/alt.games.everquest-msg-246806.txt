I quit about 3 months ago, I too got tired of playing the shaman.  Guild
raid every night thing, mini's and time.  I hit 389aa's and there was
nothing else to do.  I had a good RL friend quit and sell his account for
$1200.00 (65 Wizzy, max aa's and 30 banked, 1M pp).  I said well should get
some of mine investment time out.  I sold mine for $450.  I keep looking
over the news group and waiting for the EQ2 beta.  But I will never play EQ2
like I did EQ again.
