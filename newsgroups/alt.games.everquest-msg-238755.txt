Hmm.  No warrior type.  No cleric.  No crowd control.  And a ranger as the main
tank?  I wouldn't be in a hurry to go in either.    After 10 minutes of waiting
I would have suggested leaving the mission and finding a replacement.  It's
usually easy to find *one* person to join.  I would question the motives of a
group who wouldn't agree to this.
A bad group is worse than no group.
Healea Sternstar - 58 cleric
Skila Windrunner - 57 ranger
Jennaii - 45 druid
Linni - 31 shaman
Stormfoot - 31 warrior
