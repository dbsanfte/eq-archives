The bone and ceramic look like shafts, they are sold below the parabolic on
the vendor list.

Don't try for Trueshot till you have 200 skill level.  Do you have any skill
mods?  I have tinkered fletch mod that my guildie was kind enough to make
for everyone (it's a small guild)

Aeonla's Fletch guide for all fletching advice
http://makeashorterlink.com/?C1EC256B

Gets expensive the higher your skill is.  Last stack of materials I bought
cost over 100pp and that merchant liked me....oh well, guess I gotta go over
to RM and pharm some giants.

Good luck
