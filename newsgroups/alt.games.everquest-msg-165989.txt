If you don't understand it, I can't possibly explain it to you.

Nothing, see above.

I'd love to go over each of your points, but I won't. If you want to 
take the time, a quick Google search will come up with every single 
iteration of each argument, for an against, that you could possibly wish 
for. I've been in every single discussion in a.g.e about improper names 
since the game came out, and honestly, I grow weary.
