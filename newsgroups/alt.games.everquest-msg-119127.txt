Yes, I did. I don't recall the GM communicating over guildchat.
Apparently we're both acting on memory, neither of us has proof, and
our memories are slightly different. Lacking definate evidence, what
gives you grounds to shoot at my character over something which you
gave the clear impression you aren't certain on? At least, not until I
challenged it and gave you an excuse to start in with attacks and
insults....

Actually, I don't recall that thread, sorry. Not saying the
conversation never happened, just that either the comment from me was
made in passing and the issue wasn't important enough for me to make
not of after making the comment or even return to the thread or that
it's a long-dead horse that you're digging up in your usual obsessive
way...

See my other post... You have no more solid evidence to support that
they CAN detect speed hacks server-side than I do that they can't, so
I'd advise you to clam up with the insults, jackass.

I've never seen proof that they can actively monitor /gu chatter.
You're rather quick to attack like a rabid dog when someone challenges
your assumption that lacks any proof whatsoever about how the
challenge has no proof...

The possibility that you could be wrong is just so horribly painful to
you that you resort to insane attacks at the first suggestion,
obviously. Two words: Grow up.
