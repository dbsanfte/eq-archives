Sorry, but you're just plain wrong.  Here's my source:
http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/gulfwar.asp

You can confirm that with several other reputable sites, although
Snopes should be enough for you.

Here's the relevant section of Bush Sr.'s book:

Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an
occupation of Iraq, would have violated our guideline about not
changing objectives in midstream, engaging in "mission creep," and
would have incurred incalculable human and political costs.
Apprehending him was probably impossible. We had been unable to find
Noriega in Panama, which we knew intimately. We would have been forced
to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. The coalition would
instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in anger and other
allies pulling out as well. Under the circumstances, there was no
viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our
principles. Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a
pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in
and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations'
mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response
to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion
route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power
in a bitterly hostile land. It would have been a dramatically
different -- and perhaps barren -- outcome.

You're wrong again, but this time, I'm going to have to insist you do
your own research.  Here's a hint: It's in the same book.

Your revisionist history is very creative.  You must have very bad
sources of information (Rush Limbaugh?).  I suggest you choose your
sources of information more carefully in the future.

It's just worth pointing out to spectators of this thread the kind of
smear and scare campaign the republican party is running these days.
A lot of people are going to vote for George W. Bush based on
downright false information.  Anyone who votes for George W. Bush
because otherwise "the UN will run America!!!" is terribly ignorant.

It's terribly unethical behavior, just like the "terror threat" level
being raised to damage the effect of the Democratic National
Convention a few weeks/months back.  People need to be aware that the
republican party is manipulating them and lying to them.  Their
behavior is terribly deceitful.

> They'd been allowed 6 or 12 months multiple times.

And?  If we let them go another 6 - 12 months they'd have used their
non-existant WMDs on us?  What's the rush, man?  What's the rush?
Wouldn't it have been better to get more international support first,
even if the U.S. never did get support from the UN?  Maybe get some
real evidence instead of some manufactured evidence/lies?  It's just
common sense.  George W. Bush lacks good old common sense.

Ask Saddam Hussein.  They apparently did not, in fact, have anything
to hide, maybe it was just Saddam being prideful (a glaring weakness,
I might add, that Saddam Hussein shares with George W. Bush).

Go ahead, hit me with your theories.  They're quite inventive.

How about we elect a president that seems to have at least two brain
cells to rub together to try to make hard decisions like that for us,
rather than keep on with George W. Bush, who apparently couldn't even
challenge a monkey intellectually?

Same answer.

The U.S. isn't going to start a war with China, and China isn't going
to start a war with the U.S.  China could, however, be convinced to
back the U.S. when it comes to N. Korea, although George W. Bush isn't
the man to do that.  He can't even get along with his allies, much
less anyone else.

Of course.  It's similar to the usual kinds of arguments I hear from
republicans.  Anything good that happens can be attributed to
republicans somehow, anything bad that happens can be attributed to
democrats somehow.  The republican propaganda machine has been very
good at pushing that nonsense at us for years.  A lot of people
actually believe it.

I simply don't believe in any organized religion.  I do, however,
believe in God.
