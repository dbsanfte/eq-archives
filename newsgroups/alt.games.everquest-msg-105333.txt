I had heard a lot of stories like this myself, so somewhere over a
year ago I tried dual wielding a pair of them with a 25 warrior, dex
over 100.  Got hardly any procs at all.  Around the same time I had
char who was spending some time fighting in Paw, even when NPCs had
these they were not proc'ing often against me.  Have to wonder
whether the proc rate on these was deliberately reduced, perhaps as
a "stealth nerf" of pet classes?  If I recall correctly there was
still alot of noise coming from the melee community about how
overbalanced the Mage and Necro pets were at the time, and I remember
the Lariats used to be very popular as pet weapons.
