No, some people just have a concept of the fundamental underpinnings of 
western law, even if the lawyers have long since forgotten.  -Nobody- has a 
right to access to the property of another.  The law may encroach, 
improperly, on property (ie, easements and rights of way), but that does not 
make it right.

Civil rights are misnamed.  They aren't rights unless they are applied to 
discrimination by the government.

Then your country may not have proper regard for property.  Which, in my 
opinion, does not make for a civilized nation.  Guess what, I discriminate 
on who I allow into my house.  You've got to be a friend of mine to get in. 
I offer no clear and defensible reason.  And, if you don't like it, I'll 
give you a choice, .357 or 9mm.

Oh, you're one of those idiots.  (and, for the record, I don't regard people 
who oppose Bush to be idiots, only those who can't help but bash him at any 
chance they get, whether it pertains to the topic at hand or not).  And, 
yes, there is a reason why Mr. Bush was elected.  The majority of Americans 
either liked his ideas better than the competitions, or hated them less.

> But I don't think he will. He shan't survive the next general election.

That's what we thought about Austrailia and America.
