Ok, remembering that I'm a total newbie on this PC hardware
configuration stuff, I ran dxdiag.exe to get my driver information. If
I'm giving you the wrong information, please tell me where to get the
correct driver information.  Here's what I appear to have for a "main
driver" for my video card:
nvdisp.drv
4.13.01.2185 (English)

Does that sound right?
Anyway, runs great on my system.
