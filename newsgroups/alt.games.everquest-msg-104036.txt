There is no lore version of the Centi longsword. If there was would not there be
more of those for sale than the non lore version? I have yet to see a lore
version of the Centi longsword. I know several people offering large sums of
plat just to look at a lore version and guess what! They have never seen one. It
is a misinformed rumor that is running way to rampart and making players very
angry and others very rich. =)

I am sure it is started from the fact that the Centi shortsword is lore and the
fact that Verant "mentioned" that the Centi longsword might become lore also.
