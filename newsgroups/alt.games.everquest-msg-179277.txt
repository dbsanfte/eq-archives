Exactly what does the skill up do for you?  More hitpoints per bandage?
Faster?

I just starteed to use the bandage skill, and have found that I regen my HP
back faster just sitting.in the time it takes to get 2 hp of health back for
a bangage I would have goten 4 back just sitting.  Also when my bandage is
done the health bar goes up to about 80 % and then back down to about 1%
over what it was before.  Please tell me as I skill up this actualy becomes
economical.  As a Ogre SK I don't have good Charisma and these things are
getting expensive.
