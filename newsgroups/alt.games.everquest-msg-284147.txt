	:-)  If you're doing new content then  you're probably
not geared up for it...

	Hmmm, maybe... I like the mob rheostat set at "a little
too hard for this group" because otherwise the fun-factor approaches
/yawn.  I really hate sitting around grinding away at blues while
the tank practices piercing and the cleric does her nails :-) :-)

	I both agree and disagree.  A cleric's not as good as a shaman
at off-tanking because he can't hold aggro nearly as well.  A cleric's 
much better at it than a druid is because druids are squishy and because
they don't put a lot of points into avoidance and mitigation untiil late
because they've learned not to get hit.

	But I'm not talking about off tanking.  I'm talking about being
able to toss dangerous heals knowing you can live with the consequences,
at least for a little while.  For instance, think of named pull with multiple
adds and inadequate crowd control (Terris Thule or Mithaniel Marr, or 
a bad pull in RS, or a gater).  Not only does a cleric have safe ways
of healing the whole group but he can decide to let go with a group cheal
knowing that even if he attracts attention he has good mitigation and
avoidance as well as 3 shots at invulnerability to keep him up.  If 
the cleric wants to he can fast heal the puller on his way back and still
chain quicks on the tank while things get locked down. 

	It's not needed - almost nothing in EQ is *needed* but having that
speicialized dedicated healer will help you kill bigger mobs faster.
Backup healing will help prevent mistakes or bad luck on the part of the
main healer, and you can kill more mobs faster so runes don't drop even 
more :-)

	It's suprising they can stand there at all <ducks>! :-)  Leather
is for shoes not chestplates :-) :-)
