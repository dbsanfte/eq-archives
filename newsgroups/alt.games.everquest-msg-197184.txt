Many of the maps I've downloaded are great, but I just wish that
peopel would all design them for the default texture.   On some maps,
the lines or text are unreadable at the default texture.  On other
maps, half the map is readable at the default texture, but readable if
you switch it to a very dark color, but at that very dark color, your
cross-hairs and the other half of the map becomes unreadable.  I
actually died trying to find my way to Acryllia Caverns zone-in
because I was constantly trying to fiddle with the textures to try to
figure out the way.

Also, I find that even on the GOOD maps, that the lines for the walls,
etc. are in a very dark color, easily visible at the default texture,
while the labels are in a very light color (yellow or white) which I
find totally unreadable at that texture, (plus the labels are FAR too
tiny for me to read on most of them).  For some reason I can' select
to t manipulate a label on a map unless I added that label myself
I'm not sure why that is, or if I'm doing something wrong.  What I
REALLY would want to do is to change the color and size of all the
existing labels.  

I'm not sure why, but I seem to be the only one having these
readability problems with the maps.  I'm a nearsighted guy, but my
vision isn't too bad when I wear my glasses.
