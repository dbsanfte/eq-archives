Well, sure, if you're the only 4 manaburn wizards on your server.
Just because you *can* kill a 32k dragon doesn't mean you'll find the
bastards up to kill.  Not only that, it's not like there is *that*
much great loot on Kunark dragons that a guild with 4 manaburn wizards
really needs.  Well, maybe green scales from Sev, though there are
many, many better warrior weapons than epic.

All of the classes have some seriously powerful AA points.  Casters
seem to get more than melee, but I don't think that you can say that
manaburn is anywhere NEAR as powerful as dire charm.  
With AA Verant found a way to seriously increase power without
increasing levels.  Maybe they should make Kunark dragons invunerable
to manaburn, like they made Vox & Naggy untouchable by characters over
level 52.

Excuse me?  How in the hell do you equate Kunark boss mobs to a
quarter of the game content?  A well played wizard kicks ass with or
without manaburn.  Some of the new and/or revamped zones really call
out for damage NOW or CR in 5 seconds.  Manaburn is nothing more than
a really nifty party-trick 99% of the time.  Sure, there are a handful
of mobs that can be punked by a group of manaburn wizards, but I don't
think that's much more overpowering than a rogue having the ability to
assassinate a mob.  It's rare, it's not always going to work, and it's
an ability that was earned.

The outdoor dragons may or may not be killable by 4 people.  The
indoor dragons are in no way killable by 4 manaburn wizards.  I know
that the 4 wizards could get Gorenaire, Sev, and Talendor solo and
manaburn them down, but they're not doing squat against Trakanon, and
they're not even going to be trying to do anything in VP by
themselves.
