Well, not today.  A 'raid' can take group mobs.  Not that
it couldn't be changed, of course -- but it could have been
changed in EQ as well and wasn't.

Okay.   But, like I said, you can group at level 6 into
a raid and take group content, no problem.  *shrug*

And my point was he's wrong, just as I pointed out in the
paragraph you quoted.  Not all buffs take concentration,
only long-lasting group buffs.  SoW, for instance, will be
kept up just as it was in EQ -- by casting on each player
in the group.  It's just the buffs like EQ's group-Skin lines
and KEI (mana regen) that take concentration.
