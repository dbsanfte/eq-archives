The Temple of Droga has the Shroud of Nature which is one of the best wisdom
chest items you can find.  Also there is the Mammoth Skin Cloak in
Permafrost, NightShade Wreathe in Mistmore, Mith Bracers, Plat Arms, and
GEBS all of which are extremely useful wisdom items for a druid as well as
the Charred Guardian Shield.  Most of these things and several other ones
that are even better require either a very strong group to get or a
character higher even than lvl 40 so you are best borrowing money from your
cousin going to EC and buying them.
