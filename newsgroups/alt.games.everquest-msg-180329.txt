Is it just me or do these guys only drop 20+ plat one time in 10? Rumors of
a 20pp average drop I've found to be COMPLETELY innacurate..... In an hour
or more of killing them (reckon i nailed maybe 20) I only had two 20+ drops
and ALL the rest had no more than 4pp loot, not counting fine steel and
assorted near worthless jewelery. It's actually worth taking down the
cyclopses because THEY sometimes drop 4pp and are a hell of a let easier and
less dangerous to kill!

The good news is that the level 49 shadowknight spells and pet make fear
kiting HG's an absolute laugh, which is great fun for someone who's played
the lvl 48 and below SK vs HG game as a serious source of income and exp.
(Cast darkness, cast fear, count 4-5 swings, recast fear.. interrupted or
lagged? Kiss goodbye to 300-500hp! Spend 50% of your time either lifetapping
hp back from lizards or medding up because you just wasted your last 3
bubbles of mana on lifetaps haha)

My new pet is excellent for adding damage (previous pet hardly ever hit let
alone did more than 1hp dmg, new one often belts for 22 or 28, acts like a
very nice dot), the new snare (dooming darkness) although very expensive
does significant damage and slows them RIGHT down, the new fear spell is
never resisted, hardly ever interrupted because of its very short cast time
and lasts AGES, usually enough so that only one cast of it ends the fight!
(which is handy cos it costs almost as much as the darkness to cast) And the
nukes... 390hp of nukes once or twice a fight depending on mana/need makes a
huge difference... when fear wears off ive got the option of either fearing
again or tanking through with the aid of an extra 390hp dmg which can be
applied in 2 seconds flat...

The other thing the pet is excellent for is smacking down the placeholders,
which is where I perform an excellent service both to myself and the
bone-lazy druids :P He runs after the lizards that flee, helps a lot against
giant skelleys (hes almost good enough to solo one i think but i havent
tried and is great for taking down 2 mobs at once... send pet after one and
take on the other yourself).

Looking forward to 51 where my skill caps move up a lot :) And 52 when the
new-new pet arrives (lvl 28, quads a lot?) And 54 when my nukes add up to
790hp....

Oh and one other thing...... maybe a quarter of the giants are still dark
blue! Bonus!!! Faster exp than when they were ALL dark blue at 45 - because
i can kill them SOOO much faster...

Cheers,
James
