You dont know any good enchanters then. It's not hard to see the current
target is at 25% and go cast a paci or two, then target the unpaci'd mob and
use a social to let the puller know you're ready for /assist, or that he
should just do a door check, and see if there were any mobs tucked to the
left or right of door. Better than a monk running off & losing dps on the
tail end of the mob, better by far than a monk FD'ing in the next room with
4-5 mobs on him. Also better than a tank in the wrong dungeon who cant help
but pull 3-4 at a time.

Terrible groups HAVE to have an enchanter, average groups can get by without
but risk deaths or a wipe (and thus downtime), and awesome groups dont need
an enchanter but take one anyways. Finishing in 45-50 minutes with CC is
much more fun & relaxing than finishing in 40 but having to fight 2-3 mobs
at a time (though the most fun I've had in LDON to date was when we fought 7
at once in Tak & won).
