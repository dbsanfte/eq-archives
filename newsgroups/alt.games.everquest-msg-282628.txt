Interesting.  I see they are handling name conflicts the EQ1 way: add an 'x'
to one of the names, and let that person choose a new name.

They should have done it more like the way DAoC handled it, although the
reasons for merges were different.  Because of the RvR component of DAoC,
you want a crowded server for the RvR zones, but for the PvE zones, you
don't want it to be too crowded--you want enough people to get groups, but
not so many that you fight over access to content.

So, what they did, instead of server merging, was server clustering.  They
took groups of servers, and made it so the RvR zones and the main city zones
where shared by the servers.  The PvE zones remained separate.  So, if I'm
on the Lancelot server and enter Camelot City, there will also be people
from the Pellinor, Kay, and Iseult servers there.  Same with the RvR zones.

When I zone out to Camelot Hills, I'm in the Lancelot Camelot Hills.
People from the other servers zone into the Camelot Hills from their server.

There's an NPC you can talk to in Camelot City who can switch which server's
zones you use, so if you want a group of people from different servers in
the cluster, you can talk to him and get everyone to use the same zones.
(Also handy when I was doing a quest about a minute behind someone else, and
he kept beating me to mobs on 30 minute respawn timers...so I went and did
the quest in another server's zones).

Here's how they handle names.  Suppose I'm Froboz on Lancelot, and there is
a Froboz on Pellinor.  People on Lancelot see me and can talk to me as
"Froboz", and they use "Froboz of Pellinor" to refer to that other guy
(which they can abbreviate to "Froboz of p").  People from Pellinor would
use "Froboz" for him, and "Froboz of l" for me.  People of Iseult would use
the "of" form for both of us.
