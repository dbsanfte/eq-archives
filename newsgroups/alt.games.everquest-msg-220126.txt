If it is just the /con color they want to provide, then the obvious thing to
do is make the name in the target window be that color.  Another nice thing
would be to make the names above the heads colored, so you can see the /con
color without having to target.

It should be one window with a tabbed interface, or perhaps a list on the
side of all the people you have tells from that you can click to select
whose tells are currently shown, so that if you get a lot of tells, your
screen won't get covered with tell windows.

Excellent.  This has always bugged me, because when you think about the
skills that level 1 characters already have (e.g., they can use weapons well
enought to go out and fight, casters know enough magic to handle their spell
book and cast level 1 spells, and so on), it's clear that they spend their
youth training to be adventurers.  It didn't make sense that they would have
outdoor skills poorer than the average Earth Cub Scout.  They should all
have good Sense Heading, Bandaging, and Foraging.
