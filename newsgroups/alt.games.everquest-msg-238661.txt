Unless you want to take the easy route and farm greens for tradeskill
components, it depends on whether you're tied to pickup groups or have
a regular group that you exp with and can drag to some of the more out
of the way dungeons. The spots where I got my lvl 60 spell money are
passe now, spots where I got the cash for lvl 65 spells are Droga,
Veksar and ChardokB. ChardokB probably being the best if you're after
spells since any of the lvl 60 spells can drop there (I've seen Torpor
and Sunstrike) as well as all the research words. 

Veksar (nobles/highbornes, remains or sewers) also has decent research
drops although you don't have a chance at the spells themselves.
