I'm trying to do the newbie armor quests for my Monk and my Necromancer.
Problem is, I can't find the cloth sandals for the Monk's sandals anywhere;
I have the other ingredients already, and I tried buying small cloth
sandals - It didn't work.

I'm also having a devil of a time finding gilla monster bile. I need it for
the Necromancer Robe (I already have better armor for the rest of my Necro's
body, so that's the only piece I'm going after). I've been wandering around
North Ro for several hours, and during that time I've only encountered 4
gilla monsters; none dropped the bile, but I got the skins right away.

So my questions are:

1. Where can I buy or kill something that drops cloth sandals that will work
with the combine for the Monk sandals? (I'm based out of Freeport, and
haven't done the faction quests in Shadow Haven)

2. Is gilla monster bile No Drop, or should I be able to find it on vendors
occasionally?

3. What color is the Necromancer newbie armor, anyway? (The Freeport
version, that is)

Thanx.
