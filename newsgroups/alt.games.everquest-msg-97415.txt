It doesn't change what is learned, just the amount of time the newbie
is encouraged to spend learning it.

I'm expecting that a good majority of true newbies after this patch
are going to be completely flummoxed the first few times they die
after level 10, because they won't have learned the valuable lesson of
paying careful attention to where they are to make corpse recovery
easier. "Has anybody seen my corpse?" is going to become a motto for
these people.
