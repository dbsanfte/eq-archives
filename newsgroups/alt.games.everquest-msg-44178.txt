Ithink there should be a zone connection in Kunark connecting with
Stoneburnt Mountains. I would cut down on some of the travel time but would
still allow ported to make PP porting people around. I am really tired of
the travel time. There a lot of quests that I just haven't done because it
wooould take to long to travel around for the quest.

Don't know how well trolls swim but the firepots at the bottom corner of TD
would have plopped you directly  on the Erud docks saving you from running
all the way across Antonica.

But yeah, the EQ world has gotten way too large with all of the expansions
to continue with the current player based transport mechanism. There needs
to be a way EVERYONE can cover long distances quickly and at will.
