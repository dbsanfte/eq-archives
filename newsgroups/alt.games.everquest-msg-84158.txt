I am still getting the stuttering if I turn up the sound acceleration,
so no change there, BUT now all the sounds (change clinking, swiming,
walking... pretty much everything) sound like they are coming out of
a tin can.  I double checked... and no- I'm not using a tin can to play
Eq, and I'm not sitting in one while playing either.

I've talked to a couple of people that have heard this too and I was
wondering if it effected everyone that had luclin?  Is there a way to
revert back to the old _sounds_?  All in all I am very UNimpressed with
Luclin- seems like a cobbled together undertested buggy as hell overrated
waste of $20 (on sale even), but thats just my opinion- I haven't even
gone to the moon yet.
