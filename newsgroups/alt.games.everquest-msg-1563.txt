Heh.  He probably summoned the best weapon he could.  Next time, ask
for a weapon of a type you can use better.  It may be weaker, but you
can hunt wisps with weak magic weapons if you're a decent level (8 or
so).  Just watch out.  They will get help from other wisps.  Make sure
to pull them away from the wisp spawn areas so you don't end up with 2
or 3 of them on you at once.  That's death on wheels.  Also, look
carefully at a wisp before attacking it.  Sometimes 2 or 3 of them are
very close to each other and move together, so they can look like a
single wisp if you don't look closely.
