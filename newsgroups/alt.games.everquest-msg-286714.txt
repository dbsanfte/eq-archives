	For newbies that's a twink, at 10pp each.  I'm hoping these
hypothetical new missions can be made fun yet challenging to real new
players as well as old by clever plotting rather than by cheap tricks like
see invis mobs or summoning yard trash.

	For real new players scraping up the 100 plat for enough of those
dumb potions to be safe is a stretch. (And being able to manage clicking 
them... When I first discovered them I'd have trouble navigating, watching 
for the appearing message, and finding the potion to click although that's 
easier now too...) 

	So I'd like to make the way through require...timing a pacing
guard and running by when he's not facing you...carefully picking the
way past hidden lava pits...knowing the correct combination of gems to
press on the secret door (and it could change for each mission as long as 
the hint to solve it wasn't so difficult as to frustrate children)...stuff
like that.  IMHO there's too much reliance in EQ on the afore-mentioned
cheap tricks, or just loading up the hitpoints, and so on, when there's
so much opportunity for creativity...  

	Oh, yeah, and it sucks that they don't put network status on 
the network status page..

	Lol :-)
