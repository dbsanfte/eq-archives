Never claimed it was "about me". Just didnt want to have that little bit
thrown back at me.

Now admittedly I took a rather offensive approach in my denunciation  : P

Curious here though... I Would have thoght that as a necro these changes
would have been VERY Welcome when soloing. Binding to 70% while sitting and
medding, and getting the extra hp regen seems to this VERY uninformed on
things necro person to be a huge advantage since it seems to me that hp =
mana = Exp for a necro at any level over 8.

Of course I could be all wrong about this too...
