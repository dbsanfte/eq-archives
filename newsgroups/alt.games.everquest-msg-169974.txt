they used to say it takes the same time to get to 50 as it takes to
get from 50 - 60. Was quite true in my case, took me 2 years, equally
split.
I then started to PL me a little two box partner who will probably hit
50 with about 2 weeks played time. Twinkage, simplified newby rules,
and the fact that you "know" what you're doing makes the low level
game basically irrelevant. The decisive change in the game came when I
moved from doing group level mobs to multigroup/raid only ones.  This
is when you have to show what you learned over the  last year, and
where a single failure can wipe not just you or some pick-up group but
a whole guild.  This is when you turn off the football game on TV at
the 2 minute warning with your team down 20:21 and driing at the 20
yard line - because mob XYZ is inc, and you don't have time to be
distracted.  There is so much more to the game then killing frog_8925,
get there, and you'll be surprised (I hope pleasantly).

PS: multi group encounters can be level dependend, I remember when
doing PoZs in the arena was a guild outing, not something 3 peeps did
dual boxing for exp.
