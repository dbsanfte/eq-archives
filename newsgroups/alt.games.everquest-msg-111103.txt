The best place I found for the high teens- low twenties was Paludal Caverns.
Great XP, decent money from all the bronze weapons and armor, and constant
spawns at both bandit camps. Usually fairly easy to find a group in there,
too, at least on Mith Marr. I spent most of 19 and 20 in there, and have
been back a few times until I hit 25, when almost everything started conning
green.
