Don't know why you're having a problem with faction.

I played a Human SK worshipper of Innouruk which should have pretty similar
faction. It took a lot of kobolds, and I do mean a lot. I think I spent five
levels there just killing kobolds. But, he's now amiable, and actually
getting the key was cause for much rejoicing in /ooc. I think you just need
to kill more kobolds.
