Warrior?  Perhaps the least useful class in the game.  You need one to kill
big bad mobs.  A second one standing ready in case your first goes LD
or something.  Then you'd rather have any other class for the rest of
your raid.

Paladins are more useful than warriors, and that nerf to a high end AA would
not have changed the reasons for that in the slightest.  Paladins are SA of
choice
as they can grab aggro fast when the MA dies or unmezable adds show up,
they can sponge up the damage almost as well, they can provide decent group
heals (your cleric is too busy to do that most of the time) they can stun for
caster control, root for crowd control, and are in the same damage class as
the warrior and cleric you think you are competing with (which is to say,
significant but not earth shattering).  Given the choice between a third,
fourth,
fifth warrior and a paladin, second paladin, third paladin, I'd go for the
paladins
every time.

Further, paladins can do almost all of those jobs just as well with crappy
equipment as they can in uber gear.  Warriors are entirely gear dependant,
which means you pick your best geared warrior as MA every time.  Make a
new warrior, and he's never going to get picked to do the one job a warrior
does well in any established guild, because there will always be someone
who's been a warrior far longer than you, with far better gear.

Worrying about Slay nerfs is missing the point entirely... against certain
limited
targets, a level 60 paladin with tons of AA invested in a trick can do
significant
damage while MT>  but he's not going to be MT anyway, cause that uber
geared warrior is just plain better at it.  So unless you purposefully were
trying to create the character in order to have him solo undead for AA points..
well damage output and MAing, neither of those are really in the paladin
job description!
