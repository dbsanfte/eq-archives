From what I saw, in the couple of hours I helped a friend camp the
assassin in Lower Guk before we got bored, the new mobs have replaced
the old mobs completely for the duration. I don't know if this is true
of all of them, as I really haven't been that interested in any of the
drops. The new jboots are also dropping in Najena, which has brought
back the permanent group camping dres that was so fun back in the days
before the AC quest. Have you tried the AC in OOT? I don't know if it's
been changed too but the one thing about it is if you put the time in,
you're pretty well guaranteed a pair of boots.
