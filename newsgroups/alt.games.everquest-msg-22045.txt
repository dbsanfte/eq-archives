There's a better way to do this trick.  You need to convice the other
guy to join your group somehow.  Once you do, have them wait on you to
to got the bank and  bring the phat lewts over to them.  When you're
at the bank, withdraw maybe 20 plat or so from your account, convert
it all to copper on your person, and then /split the coin off to them.
Have fun watching the little bastard decide between the delimma of
being able to move vs free coin.
