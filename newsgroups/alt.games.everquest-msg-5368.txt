My rather smallish guild needs two sponsors, no dissention (I believe;
none of the people we don't like have tried to join :) ) and has a
month probationary period during which you can't sponsor and can't
have twinks guilded. We're also not taking in new members at the time;
old members are allowed to rejoin, and twinks are taken in, but people
asking for sponsoring are told to wait.
