A few days ago sony reversed all bans on people who used EQWindow, and they
now accept it. :)  Gotta love it, i've been using it forever, it's so
helpful, not only for multiple accounts, but just for stuff like checking
web sites and e-mail and IM's and such.  Wonderful detailed answers to
Winterfury's questions, though :).  I give it a 9.5 on the
'response-o-meter'.
