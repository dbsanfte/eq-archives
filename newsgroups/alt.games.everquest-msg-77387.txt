Hola...  

I've taken this to Sony help, and so far there's no solution, so I'm taking it
to the masses to see if anyone here has faced this.

I was in Thurgadin one day, had just character hopped, and for the first time,
I had those staticy lines across my inventory and bank screens.  I decided to
zone to see if it'd fix it, but as soon as I rounded a corner, boom, right to
desktop.  Well, that happens sometimes, so I went to log back in, and I got
some note about my EAL file being missing, and it redownloaded it and some
config stuff--no idea what.

Ever since then, I can't log into EQ.  I get as far as the first splash screen
with the elf lady on it, and that's it.  If I click "connect," it freezes; I
can't even get to the login screen.  ALL other buttons on there work
fine--options, credits, account, etc.

I'm using Windows ME (no cracks), 640 meg of RAM (down to 512 at tech
suggestion), AGP Rage Fury Pro, Soundblaster PCI512, 56k connection.  I've
tried changing page files, virus checking, disabling my sound card, and
removing RAM (to get it down to that 512 mark), and nothing so far.

HELP!  It's been 3 days, I'm going nuts!
