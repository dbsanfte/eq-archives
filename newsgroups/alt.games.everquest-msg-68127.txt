Well, that depends on whether you are figuring the cost in USD or
Swiss Francs.  

If you are meaning 40 to 60 Swiss Francs the price is less than or
only slightly greater than the suggested retail of $29.99 USD here in
the USA.  Now if you are referring to $40 to $60 USD (roughly 65 to
100 CHF) then indeed the cost is much higher......

Then again, Swiss Chocolate is a lot more expensive when we import it
into the US as well=)
