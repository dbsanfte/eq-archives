Got the platinum edition yesterday. First thing I've got to say is I was 
impressed with how easily and smoothly my transition from the 30-day 
trial was. A few clicks and everything was ready to go.

Anyway, the graphics had always been the one thing I told people were 
the biggest downfall to EQ....but I didn't realize the vast difference 
between the original graphics and the current graphics. Verant is really 
doing themselves a disservices by not having the graphics update in the 
30-day trial.

For those of you that have forgotten just how far the graphics have 
come, or, for those of you on the 30day trial and not sure if you're 
going to keep playing, I offer up these two picks of my main char, in 
both pics he's wearing the *exact* *same* *armor*!

Oh, and started a Magician last night. It is AMAZING how much easier he 
is to play than a Wizard. 20% away from level 4 and my first pet. I 
can't wait!
