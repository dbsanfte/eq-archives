Ummn - never noticed that but that my do more to prove your point than
disprove it - living in an opposite time zone to the majority of other
players I tend to be the only one in zone when I have hunted there. I have
always tended to move about a bit as soloing you zip about picking up easy
singles from wherever they can be found. I suppose if such code existed it
could majorly affect a static group confined to a particular patch of turf
by other groups in the immediate area.
