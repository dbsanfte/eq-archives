Hi:

I just wanted to thank those of you that replied to my question. I did
wonder if could have been due to internal heat, but today I booted up my PC
and was greeted with a very bad screen yet again. Ironically I was able to
get a clean boot the second time and whilst I'd not had problems without
running EverQuest before, today I did. Rather than open the PC, which is
hard for me as I'm disabled I downloaded the Detonator driver as advised and
so far .. fingers-crossed, all seems to be well. I've played EverQuest for
two hours without a hitch, so maybe, just maybe the Windows driver
downloaded from Windows Update was corrupted.

I'll keep you posted on the situation .. thanks again ..

Safe hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
