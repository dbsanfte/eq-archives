While monks aren't listed as a possible class for the kitties at this time,
they *might* be by the time SoL is actually released. /pray. ;)

In any case, my main reason for replying to this post is to point out that
the monk/shaman duo is one of the best duos that's out there. A monk and his
pet shaman can take on at least some bits of nearly every zone in the game
quite effectively. Monks are considerably better than rangers at tanking
(though not at taunting, mind you :), and only slightly behind paladins. SKs
and warriors will of course blow a monk out of the water, but we knew that
anyway. :)

It *seems* as if the beastlord class is going to be sort of a hybrid between
monks and shamen. Amusingly enough, a beastlord/shaman duo might just work.
