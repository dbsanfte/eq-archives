Petition, since this was actually a quest you started with items you
DO have the right to the mob in this case. Something probably will be
done about it because they can check and see that:

1) you started the quest at X time and cyrystic looted the legs off
the mob at X time.

2) cyrystic has no drop legs while never instigating the quest

3) you never got the no drop legs.

A Gm can check all of these things and Cyrystic will likely
incriminate themselves by lying. Lying to a verant rep is bannable. As
I said above, the verant person can check all of these things. They
even have the tools to check the chain of ownership of an item, though
that is not applicable here, and to check logs about quests.

The problem you have is actually accelerating this to a GM and getting
them to bother.
