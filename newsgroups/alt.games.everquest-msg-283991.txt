Honetly, no.  Not with you.  I try to keep things civil and on topic
in these boards but from everything you've posted I would not want you
in my group.  You don't seem to understand your role, much less the
role of others.  I say this because you feel you need to just
constantly heal every stupid party member that gets a beatdown.  This
is not what a cleric should be doing.  Keeping the MT alive is the
goal of the cleric, everyone else is superfluous.  If they have to
die, they die.  Rez later.

I like to group.  EQ is about grouping.  I also like necro's, and
clerics, and berserkers, and paladins, and bards.  Two of those
classes can solo well, the others vary but not so well.  Point is,
knowing who you're grouping with is vital, and you don't seem to.

Maybe you and your husband are better off duo'ing until you have a
better grip on other classes.

Some people on this bored are tools, some are just cranky but have
good, solid advice to offer.  If you can get past their gruff
commentary.
