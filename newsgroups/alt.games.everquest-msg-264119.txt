Horizons' problems: COMMUNICATION! Even during beta, the devs were
sorely tight on communication. Completely unwilling to discuss what
was coming down the pipe for future content pushes. Sure, they'd
chit-chat with us in the chatroom, but they wouldn't give much, if
any, info on coming changes. Also: CONTENT! Listen to your players!
Don't rush for a Christmas release if the game still needs another 6+
months of development!

Shadowbane: My major issue was thus: Player conduct, aside from cases
of hacking the servers or exploiting bugs, was completely in the hands
of other players to police. This turned it into a horrid sewer of
griefers and just...gah. Once you got off newbie island into the PvP
game, it just wasn't fun unless you made friends with the griefers and
became one of them. Even then, I don't see much fun in that. But it
looks like it might have been the only way to get them to leave you
alone.
