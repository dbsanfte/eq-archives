Well, I've never been on a multi-party raid, or killed a dragon, or anything
like that. So, I think this will be pretty cool. It is a big raid.. it's the
last one my guild leader is leading in Hate, so I think he didn't want to
leave anyone out. Nothing like a zergling rush! :-)

Oh well.. off to get some more exp in 46..

Thanks everyone for the comments and advice. I'm really looking forward to
tonight..

Anita
