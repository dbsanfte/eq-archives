Depends on who makes the rules. Counting with a device is cheating
in many Casinos and will get your ass thrown out. Also, even if you have
a good memory and count 'in your head' the casino will ask you to leave
if you win too much. Also, many Casinos now use 7 and 8 deck shoes for
blackjack and shuffle when they get to half, which makes card counting
much less effective.
