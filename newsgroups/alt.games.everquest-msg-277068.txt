There are a great many games and sports like this. If you want to get to 
the top in equestrianism, you have to be able to buy the best horse. 
Similarly you can't hope to succeed in Formula One unless you can invest 
enough to have the best car. A Russian billionaire recently bought 
Chelsea Football Club, and has invested over ï¿½100 million in players, 
and they are about to win the Premiership. The Americas cup can only be 
won by a billionaire. And so on and so on.
