No, snare is still a boon, as it means you can finish off the mob when it 
is ready to run without taking damage, and without any danger of it 
bringing adds when it runs away.  Not to mention snare fear kiting of 
course, although, as a ranger, your choices in doing that are much more 
limited than an SK or Necro, or even a cleric with a clicky snare.

I will admit that slow has a much bigger impact, it does allow me to solo 
many summoning mobs that I otherwise would have no chance at taking on.
