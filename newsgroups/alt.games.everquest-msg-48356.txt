They're not all equally hard though.   The Rogue epic is a walk in the park
compared to the others, and yields one of the more useful epic weapons.   The
Shaman epic and the first half (one of the two swords) of the Ranger epics are
simple as well.   Druid epics are free with 2 box tops and a trip to Karnor's
Castle.

Whereas Warriors, Magicians and Wizards got the hard ones.   Multiple hard
raids for rare drops and contested spawns.

The Cleric one is actually middle of the road for difficulty, it's just the
most useful one so the competition for Ragefire throws it off in the end.
