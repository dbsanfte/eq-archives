They are trivially soloable by a 56+ Paladin in low cost bazaar
gear, so I can't see a 59 Druid having serious problems once you
get a feel for the place (takes a whole 5 minutes, maybe 10, heh).
Root works, and at 59 your roots should stick reasonably well.
They don't hit hard, but at least one variety procs a DoT so you
might want to get a Cleric HP buff if you like to porcupine.  The
falls really aren't a big deal unless you're seriously overweight,
keep regen up and you won't even notice them.  As somebody else
mentioned, see invis is useful if you're not fond of being stabbed
in the back (for any non-see-invis folks reading this, once you
know where the spawns are you can avoid being backstabbed just by
pausing briefly within aggro range of a spawn point while facing
it).  Oh, and the mobs don't run, so snare is only useful to cut
down on the damage you take when pulling or rerooting, might not
even be worth the bother if you're rotting singles.
