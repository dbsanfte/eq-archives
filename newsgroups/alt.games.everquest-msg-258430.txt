Dear group,

I was under the impression that there were no longer any exp bonuses and
penalties based on classes, only on races.

Therefore I was very surprised today when me and my brother decided to make
identical twin characters from scratch.

I made a gnome cleric and he made a gnome paladin.
We both helped free Arias in gloomingdeep A (the instanced pre-tutorial
zone), for which I recieved level 2 and some more, but my brother only got
95% of his first level for exactly the same actions.

Can anyone shed some lights on the cause of this please?

It struck me as very strange and I felt the need to investigate it further
=)
