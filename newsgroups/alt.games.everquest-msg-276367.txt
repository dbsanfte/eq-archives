I wouldn't go to the zones just to "level up". Take some time and explore
the other zones (there are *many*). I think that's what killed the fun for
so many people was going to a few select zones to "level". Take your time
and enjoy the game (at least the first time around). On the other hand if
you're only playing to level then by all means visit the "hot" zones.

humiliation.
