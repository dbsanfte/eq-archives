Well I have to apologize Mike because I think that was my group. Just a
bunch of guild mates hooked up tp kill some specs. However there were 3
groups pulling from the island and we only had one bad pull... Our tank had
6 on him. He ran em to zone and what we did is wait him him to zone in (3
seconds tops) then the nukers and 2 tanks would zone back through (3 more
seconds tops) bash and nuke em till they got too close then zoned back to
North Ro. Did this till 4 out of 6 were dead. Then we chased the other 2
till we found one by the orc highway and the other was by the Orc camp near
the South Ro zone. We got em all, so I dont know if we are the ones who did
it. Even if we aren't I do apologize.
