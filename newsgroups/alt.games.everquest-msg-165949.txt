Any other suggestions?  I've been to Dalnir and the only piece that
dropped was a crescent arm wrap.  In terms of AC it's actually worse
than the cured silk sleeves I had, they have some deecent stats but
not enbough to make the trip and camping time worth it.

When I say post lvl 40, I really mean post lvl 50 but with crap gear,
I'll probably get slapped by post 50 mobs.

Equipment is some Wu's, a crystal covered shroud, and a leather apron.
Those are my best pieces so far....

Thanks.
