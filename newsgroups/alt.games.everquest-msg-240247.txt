The difficulty of getting the flawless hides slows everything down. The main
source seems to be one cave in DSP that is often monopolised by a level 65
farming for the bazaar, then they are sold for 550 each (on rodcet nife), so
you are either paying real money or playing a high level character to be
able to skill up on them.

I have found baking, brewing, pottery (except for the unfired ceramic
linings not stacking), and jewelcraft to be relatively easy and largely
affordable up to 200 and I recommend brewing if you want to be able to get
one skill up to past the 200's easily.

Compare that with smithing, where, if you go via acrylia, you could be
paying 580 per temper alone... that is what I sell them for and am saving
for ornate leather pieces despite only logging on briefly every day to
tradeskill.Which reminds me, better see how the windstone market is going...
