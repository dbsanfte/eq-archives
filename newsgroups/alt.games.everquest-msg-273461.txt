Dunno about "primarily west coast" servers.. but there's a guild on
Rodcet Nife that starts raiding around 9pm PST each night.  To my
knowledge, the only on the server raiding that late.  Almost all
others are Eastern times.  Called Inner Loop.  Dunno much about 'em,
but I think they're largely elemental by now.
