I don't know what the hell is wrong with Hartz -- they had
very similar problems with a line of cat flea collars that they sold
quite a while ago (about fifteen years, IIRC), and they were
slow to withdraw the product then, too.  As I recall, the
culprit was the same ingredient.  You'd think they'd learn.

As the article says, though, the competing Frontline product
is great and very safe.  It's rather expensive, but it's
worth it.  It's extremely effective.  We live in Houston,
where the heat and humidity are a perfect incubator for
annoying insects, and whenever our six cats start acquiring
fleas we Frontline them all, and *bang*, problem solved.
Frontline also has a version for dogs, which we also use
(on our dogs, natch) with never a problem.

The worst that happens when we apply Frontline is a dirty look
from the cats.

Frontline is only available from a veterinarian, as far as I
know, but they sell it over the counter, you don't need
an office visit or a "prescription".
