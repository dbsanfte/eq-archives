Sparing you the gory details, last night I finally decided to completely
wipe my primary hard drive and reinstall Win 98 and my major
applications from scratch for a nice "clean slate".

Ran into some problems with drivers and such, but eventually got
everything else working normally as before, connection to Internet,
usual browsers, mail, smaller aps, etc. I had stored my entire Everquest
folder on my spare hard drive.

Then went on to install EQ.

What I did was this: Did the EQ installation of the first disk.
(Original plus ruins of Kunark). to my D drive. (C: is just for my
operating system and some basic stuff.) Then, I went to my backup hard
drive and copied the entire contents of my old Everquest folder over the
new folder put in by the install, figuring this would give me my latest,
up to date personalized stuff, all the latest patched zone files, etc.
For the replacement of existing files, I said "Yes to all".

Tried to start it and got this error message:

The D3D8.DLL file is linked to missing export DDRAW.DLL:dEntry18.

I also got a follow-on error message saying "A device attached to the
system is not functioning."

I had some device problems before until the drivers and such got sorted,
but now there are no more "!" marks on any devices, and I *think*
everything is there and running as it was previously.

Any ideas?

System specs: (If important to this question)
IBM Intellistation E Pro 12U
Intel P3 700
GForce MX II 400 video with 64 MB
512 MB RDRAM
Sound is the original onboard that always worked "ok" before.
Hooked up over a cable modem through a hub with one other computer.
(Still working for all things, including EQ, as per normal.)

TIA
