No, it was pure name-calling.  As you say, please try to keep up.

You'll be calling the police on women whose ankles are visible then, right?

If you don't *fully* grasp that sentence, don't bother responding, as you
aren't equipped for this discussion.  If you do, feel free.  I love to
educate people on the meaning of the word "subjective".

Then again, feel free to respond even if you don't, as I securely assume,
*fully* grasp that sentence.  Sometimes flaming is more fun than educating,
and from experience you're the type that will just keep coming back for more
beatings so I could have my lunchtime entertainment mapped out for the next
week!  :)
