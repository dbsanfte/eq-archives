Certainly, the code that manipulates the data structures has to be
changed along with the data structures (that should go without saying). 
I interpreted the patch message to mean "this is ALL we're mucking with 
at the moment -- any code changes not directly related to this are being 
delayed".

I doubt this has anything to do with EQ2. The Test Server patch 
messages from 4/11 reads:

[quote]
  Yesterday marked the first public patch of a massive set of changes
  that included a) making the existing EQ Live servers run a whole lot 
  more efficiently, b) beginning to support EQ being localized to other
  languages, as well as c) some foundation work for Planes of Power.

  We've completely reworked a number of data storage systems -
  Characters, Guilds, and pretty much everything having to do with
  NPCs and their loot.
