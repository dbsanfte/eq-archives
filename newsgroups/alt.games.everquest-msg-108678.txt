Well, I wish there was a lot to tell about my adventures there, but I 
didn't get too far in... Two Ancient Wyverns had been trained to the hub, 
and proceeded to eat me with gusto. Luckily, a raid was going on at the 
time, so I was able to run my naked ass to NK, up to Bazaar, purchase a 
coffin, run naked *again* across Western Wastes back to the Temple, and 
have my corpse summoned by a nice SK from under the feet of those 
unfriendly critters.

Unfortunately, since the raid was in full swing, and my body was summoned 
to the zone in, it looks like I will have to eat an unrezzed death in the 
zone with the greatest concentration of epic clerics in all of Norrath. 
Oh well. I did learn a few valuable lessons, and I got a ton of 
screenshots. =)

Now I'm off to buy a stack of peridots and see if I can persuade any of 
those high-level clerics to send a click my way...
