>> Well, this is has little relationship to this post, but it reminded me of
a funny story for some reason.. Alright, my 5 year old cousin was watching
me play EQ. I'm running along and we pass a dead body. She says "Why is he
 lying down?" Then I say "Oh, he died and that's his body." "He died?"
"Yep."

 And she says "Well, I'm sorry to hear that. <<

This reminds me of a funny story (this could be a new thread .....)

My 5 yr old daughter comes up and watches me play

Monica: "You tryin to kill that lion daddy?"
Me: "Sure am."
Monica: "Why don't you just hit him over the head?"
Me: "I'm trying, but he's running away."
Monica: "Yeah, Allison does that too when I try to hit her."

Allison is her 7 yr old sister.
