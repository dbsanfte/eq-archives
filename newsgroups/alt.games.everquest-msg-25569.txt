Let's see... use "mend" as often as it becomes available (6 minute refresh
time). Don't use it in fights at very low health until your skill is up
quite a bit - otherwise it's likely to fail and kill ya (or leave you with
one hitpoint). Also "bind wounds" - it's a monk staple. Even though bandages
are expensive at low levels, it's worth it. You'll be able to bind wounds to
50% and then get another 20% by using mend. Cuts downtime.
