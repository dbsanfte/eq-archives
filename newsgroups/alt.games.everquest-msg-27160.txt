Found it!

This set me  on the right path.   It took me forever to  find the 4AGP
setting in my MB,  that was because it was not listed  as such. It was
under advanced/System optimizations where  Optimal seems to 4X AGP and
Normal is 2AGP.


Ever since than I can run it again and it runs for more than 10 seconds.

Now I do get a kernel/memory dump when I try to change the resolutions
through the menu's.  (Which seems to be a  familiar problem from other
people.) But since I can set the resolution through the INI file it is
something I can live with.

Thanks again all!
