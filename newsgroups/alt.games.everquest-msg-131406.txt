Just FYI DT, I generally use the term agnostic with the intent of the
meaning to be the same as what you intend by it, that a person basically
does not know whether or not god exists, not that he believes it is
impossible to prove.  In either case, it is not my definition, it is one of
the two dictionary definitions that I have seen in more than one dictionary.

By the second, probable less accepted definition, it is still possible to
not be an Agnostic.  You just have to believe that it is possible to prove
the existance or lack thereof of god.  You don't have to believe that it has
been proven one way or the other, just that it is possible.  Admittedly, by
this definition, I would hazard a guess that 99.99+% of people are agnostic,
thereby rendering the term fairly useless by that definition.  Hence, I
generally use agnostic in the same way that you do.
