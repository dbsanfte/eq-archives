count me out then.  can't make much money between Moltor spawns in Befallen,
which is taking up my time at moment.  Or sitting in Freeport protecting
newbiew because people are killing all the guards there (Pally quest??).
money and exp are so dull after a while.

Actually, its kind of funny watching a low level char come running back to
the gate in Freeport with 2 orc pawns on their tails; and then they realise
all the guards are chasing high level chars around.  Teaches them about
zoning to loose critters however
