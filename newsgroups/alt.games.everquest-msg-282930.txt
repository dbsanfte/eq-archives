I tried it for a few days, can't say I liked it much. There appears to
be a young and angry player base, for the most part.

Also, EVERYTHING is quest driven. You cannot go to another zone and
grind (there are no other zones, except for the generated quest zones)
if you want to. To get experience you have to get a quest and FINISH
the quest to get the xp.

Given time it may become a descent game, but not now.
