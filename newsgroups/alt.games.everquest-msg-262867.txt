It's not that I can't afford them, I suppose.  I just have no real reason to
replace the ones I have.  I did put SoftSpikes in 'em, though. ;-)

It's not the dress, and I know you know that.  It's the stat bonuses that
the gear provides.

Prime example, I have a 33 SK that is dressed head to toe in Sentient.  Now,
at the time he got it (pre Pop .. shows you how long it's been since he's
been played), it was almost uber.  Now, of course, it's little more than
vendor fodder.  I'm quite sure that a brand new baby ogre SK in the Feerrott
has better gear than my SK does.

EQ is a gear driven.  It pretty much stinks, but that's the way it is.

I can have fun with the character if I choose to solo.  It's when I decide
to group that not having certain spells in the book becomes an issue.

And, since you bring it up, not having the cleric epic has gotten my cleric
passed over by a group more than once in favor of a cleric with a click
stick.

fwiw ;-)
