True but the problem is that SoE has 2 different UI: the new default
and the old style.  The old style was supposed to be supported by SoE
but it's already broken with a missing button in the guild box and
consequently I have to put up with XML error everytime I log on.

If SoE wants us to go to the new default UI, they are going to shoot
themselves in the foot.  I'd sooner force load up a 4 year old UI
that's badly broken with today's requirement than to go back to the
new UI.
