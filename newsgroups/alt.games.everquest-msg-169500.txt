I do not understand why people seem to find misspellings to convey accent so
incredibly offensive.  I don't know if you people just plain can't read but
as long as the words are more or less spelled phonetically it takes
virtually no effort to read it -- read it as it sounds and you'll understand
it as well as you would understand someone who actually *speaks* that
accent...

As far as that "a little goes a long way" crap... if you think you can
effectively present an *entire* accent simply by putting "Suh" at the end of
a sentence or two -- well all I can say is your creative writing teacher is
a complete idiot who's far too married to the English language.  While it's
correct to use proper spelling when simply presenting information, improper
spelling to show different pronunciation is also completely correct.

Do you realize *how many* completely different accents say "Suh"?  To name a
few, British, Deep South, Southwest, East Coast, African (sometimes), even
some Middle Eastern accents.  Every one of these accents when applied to a
character will present a completely different picture.  Would you like me to
say, "That's not really roleplaying, Suh (pronounced in a thick Deep South
accent)"??  Do you think that would be more natural and easily followed than
to modify a few more words to convey not just a nonstandard (notice I don't
say "incorrect") accent, but a specific accent?  I'm sorry, my friend, but
your creative writing teacher should go back to first grade.  He/she
evidently believes that creativity and richness of form should be sacrificed
in favor of strict adherence to what she believes is the standard and
"correct" way of doing things.  People like that are the reason the vast
majority of art is shit.  Only those few people who realize that to
sacrifice creativity for technique is defeating the entire purpose have
become truly great artists.

Ok, 'nuff said... (technically speaking Ok is not a word, neither is
Alright, and "'nuff" is not the correct way to spell "enough" so I suppose I
should have said "All right, enough said", except of course that would have
presented a highly correct, professorial attitude, whereas I am trying to
show that I'm discarding that attitude and am speaking casually... but
according to the wise opinions of some people in this thread, I suppose it
could have been "All right, enough said (the preceding statement is spoken
in casual speech and is meant to contrast with the former standardized
English spelling and grammar)")

Basically if you don't like the way people roleplay then ignore them and
play your own game... but don't try to justify your narrowmindedness by
claiming that their grammar is incorrect... within limits of course, but so
far none of the examples I've seen have exceeded reasonable limits of
readability.
