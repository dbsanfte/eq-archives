yeah, they get in the "leveling is everything" mode of thought. Its
not everything but instead playing your character well at its current
level is everything.

Its kinda fun, I'm the opposite of those people and have been playing
a troll sk solo and its now up to level 34. Its great experience for
future grouping thoug because I taunt every fight even though alone
and I have got feign death pulling totally down since being all alone
I often have to do it a lot. Being a troll  in good gear with high str
I also carry every type weapon and try to keep them all maxxed.
