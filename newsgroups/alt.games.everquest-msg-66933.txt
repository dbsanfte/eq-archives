Windows (and most modern operating systems) have this thing called a
swapfile.   That swapfile is used for virtual memory and Windows programs
can use more memory than the total amout of real memory installed on
the machine.   In fact Windows thinks my PC (with 256MB real memory
installed) currently has 384MB of memory.  It's also under the impression
that, if needed, it has 1365MB of memory available before it runs out.

Yeah, what you said.  Which number (real, current real/virtual, current
maximum real/virtual) are you expecting the program to use when it
"determines how much memory you have?"
