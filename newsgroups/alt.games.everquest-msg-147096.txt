Just to take this to an analytical level, when I took physics in high school
my teacher took extra effort to help us understand the importance of
expressing useful ratios and relationships. You usually want the ratio of
value/time to make understanding it more relative to everyday events.

For example:
    Kilometers-per-hour (value/time), demostrates that as the value
(kilometers) gets larger you will go further (per-hour). This makes
practical sense.
    If the ratio was inverted to "Hours-per-kilometer", then as time (Hours"
increased), you be moving forward less. So if stopped, hours would approach
infinity, thus "slower speed" yields a larger number. Needles to say, this
is hard to understand compared to it's inverse.

By keeping a value/time ratio with "damage-per-delay" as opposed to
"dealy-per-damage" it easier to apply to game mechanics.
