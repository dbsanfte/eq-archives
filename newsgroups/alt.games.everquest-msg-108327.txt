"Utility" and versatility means having many options, not being the
best at any one thing. It also doens't mean having exclusive spells
that stack with all others.

The Druids strength from 1-60 is the "utility" and versarility of all
of their combined abilities. They can fill in the gaps in any
solo/group/raid situation. That is the power of versatility, and it
makes Druids one of the MOST (if not the most) powerful classes in the
game.

The class is NOT broken post-50 as some here claim.
