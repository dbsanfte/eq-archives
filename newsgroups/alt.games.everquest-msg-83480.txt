Its not an uncommon question when talking about computer games...I know
about it because I have friends in and interests in the gaming industry
which mean that I heard about it, but the general awareness of it amongst
friends of mine outside that particualr circle is MUCH lower than EQ.

Personally i had a look at it and didnt like a number of issues, fine nice
graphical look but graphics do not a game make. At best its one game on
the market which doesnt suit my taste, at worst its a worse game than EQ.
My odds are on the first of the two options but either make Alan's email
to me claiming its much improved compared to Everquest a nonsence.
