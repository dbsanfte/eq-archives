And you think I'd Lief you alone just because the facts don't
fit?  If your name wasn't so arboreal I'd have had to go with
BamBam the Mage's DS, which is better anyway, but Happy will take
any 2 week duration buffs he can get.  How about a COE from your
ranger?  You won't mind being at 85M- for the next month or two
will you?  Happy's sure to get trained to death by Guild des
Uberville soon enough, he's holding their paladin's BMB mana
hostage since last october.

You have got druid bracketed pretty well, they heal like a
shaman, melee like a wizard, buff like a ranger, and regen mana
like a cleric.  Jack of all trades, master of nuns!
