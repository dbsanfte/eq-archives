 Last night I was in the Tower of Frozen Shadows and killed the guy who
supposedly has the key to the 2nd floor but when we killed him he didn't drop
it.  Does he just not have the key sometimes?  I've recently seen or heard
something about key rings and was wondering if anyone had more info on these? 
Do I have a key ring and if so how do I access it?  Could this key have gone
right on my key ring?  TIA.
