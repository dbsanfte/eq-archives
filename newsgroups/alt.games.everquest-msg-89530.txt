Ok, I've found that (at least in Kunark) you can get your smithing skill
to 31 just by sharpening rusty weapons. This is a Good Thing (tm) for
the impoverished leezard smith, as rusty weapons are plentiful and
cheap/free and sharpening stones are 4 copper each.

Now, I've taken the advice here and gone to read several of the
excellent smithing guides suggested online. Many paths which would
obviously work are laid out. But the thing is, they all seem to be based
on a "goal" of simply getting your smithing skill to xxx level. (Usually
rediculously high). They either reccomend the fastest or the cheapest to
do so.

I, on the other hand, don't really give a rat's ass what my smithing
skill is "by the numbers" for the forseeable future. I just want a full
suit of banded armor, as quickly/cheaply as possible. I'm looking at
starting attempts at banded pieces at around a skill of 75 (expecting
failures) and just keeping at it until I get a full suit made.

Now metal bits trivial out lower than sharpening weapons, and are not
apparently used in making banded if I'm reading everything correctly.
What I *do* need is sheets of metal. They trivial around 51(?) and
require small bricks of ore and water to make.

So, will I advance faster and spend less money in the end (on my way to
making my various pieces of banded to wear) by making something else and
selling it back at a loss to get my skill up higher, (and possibly just
*buying* the sheets of metal when ready to try banded) or by just
jumping in at some level and trying to make the sheets of metal I need
for banded and stacking them up in the bank as I go?

My three remaining brain cells are now refusing to speak to each other
over this problem.
