Actually it's illegal in australian and probably american law to say
anything rude over any means of electronic transmission (eg phone, email,
newsgroups) and you could get done if the government really wanted to I'm
sure.. it's at their discretion. So if you send an email to your partner
telling them you really want to f*ck them, then the FBI agent who reads your
emails could lodge a complain against you... hehehe!
