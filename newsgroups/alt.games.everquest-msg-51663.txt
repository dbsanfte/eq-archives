Embarrassing myself? Fucking grow up. No, little flecks of shit like
yourself will not make me change my posting name. You give yourselves way
too much credit, don't break your arm patting yourself on theback.
The only "idiots" here are the ones that feel they must respond to something
that has nothing to do with themselves. Maybe you should call yourself
"bizybody"? Always sticking your big ass where it isn't wanted or needed.
