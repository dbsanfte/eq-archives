Hi,

I started getting a problem last night where the game would lock up when
looting, trading or buying. It seems to be related to drawring the items
on the corpse / in the trade window.

For example when I loot, I get the cash split message and then get no
more chat/messages and the lag meter goes yellow / red. 

Oddly if I do a /who all or a /who all friend the problem clears and all
the items appear normally. 

I was suffering some lag at other times and /whos seemed to clear this
up too.
I tried 2 different ISPs (From the UK) and got the same problem on both.

Just wondering if any one had seen anything simmilar ?

(I died twice while looting solo, then got a group and made most of
level 18 with no deaths by not looting :-/)

Cheers,

Jim
