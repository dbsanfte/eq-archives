How long did you wait before camping?  If you camped immediately, then you
still had the theoretical 3 hours to get the rez, and you spent one of them
hunting a cleric ("Shhh!  Be vewwy quiet!  I'm hunting clewics!") (Sorry.
Couldn't resist.)

Perhaps /camp desktop doesn't halt the timer immediately, but waits a half
hour or so.  That's all it would have taken in our case.
