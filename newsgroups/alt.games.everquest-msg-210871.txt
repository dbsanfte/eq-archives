Won't work.  You zone into the hole in the same spot regardless of where 
you fall/jump in.

Standard practice is to either have a cleric rez everybody at the bottom or 
have a 60+ bard sing group DA song.  Make sure everybody is running/turning 
on zone-in or you'll all pile up and DA won't last long enough.  Nice side 
effect of having the bard there is that they can mez/lull everything down 
there :)
