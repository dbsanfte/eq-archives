    Except the Dain doesn't gate. :-) We had an even more bizarre one
happen. The guild had just assembled at the pull spot in the well when the
Dain and a dwarf or two warped on top of the raid. We apparently won, but it
was close and people were joking about it for days afterwards.

    Bizarre that it didn't aggro the rest of you. Must have been after
someone that your bard hit with AoE Mana Song. Our first attempt on High
Priest in Ssra was like that - as soon as the tanks engaged, the bards
(which had been playing AoE songs for a long time while tanks built aggro)
got summoned and mashed.
