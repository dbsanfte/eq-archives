My guess is that a US consumer would pay the VAT up front, and could claim a
refund of the taxes from the government that collected it.  This is how it
works when you travel overseas (save your receipts, boys and girls), but
there is a floor limit before you can claim a refund (usually around 200
Euro/Dollars).  Needless to say, the process for recovering looks easy up
front, until you try to find out where and how to turn in your receipts.
It's almost not worth the effort unless you spend over 1000.00.
