The description is wrong - "Gallenite's Minor Destruction" has
these characteristics

1:  Increase Spell Damage by 20% 
2:  Limit: Max Level(34) 
3:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) 
4:  Limit: Instant spells only 
5:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) 
6:  Limit: Target(AE PC v1 excluded) 
7:  Limit: Target(PB AE excluded) 
8:  Limit: Target(Targeted AE excluded) 
9:  Limit: Target(Uber Giants excluded) 

2 means it works on spells up to 34th level, you'll
note you get a new bracer summon at 44.  This means
that mages CANNOT summon an item that works on level
39 nukes until they are level 44.
  
This won't affect you because the only damage spells
you get at 39 are Expell summoned (near useless) and
a rain (excluded by line 8 above).  So, the fact
that it doesn't work on level 39 spells doesn't 
affect a mage, but does hurt wizards without an IDII
item, as they can't get a jade bracer and use it 
with their 39 nukes, they have to get a 44+ mage to
get them an Opal Bracelet.

The other thing to note is that line 1 means 
0% to 20% (random) so an average of 10% boost.

Also note, line 4 means no DoTs (so the 44th level
mage DoT is unaffected).
