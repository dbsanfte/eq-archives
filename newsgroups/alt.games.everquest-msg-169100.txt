I started this thread wanting to find out what classes are
overpowered/underpowered according to you - _generally_ - taking into
account all aspects of EQ and how important those aspects are ...

(exp. grouping, soloing, raids, pre 50, post 50, making money, I mean if you
think exp. grouping is the most important aspect of EQ and one class is
great at it etc ...)

You don't have to give the reasons behind it because then we will just get
stuck debating that.

If you think all classes are balanced then you can just say that  - even
though I highly doubt the 15 classes with so very different abilities are
all "equal".

Maybe you think the classes are unequal but because of demand/need it
balances itself in the end.  If shamans are the most overpowered class and
as a consequence there will be too many shamans for them to get a group more
easily than another class ...

Anyway - disregarding that, are there any classes that are
overpowered/underpowered ?  Just make a short list and post it, I want to
see if I can see a pattern ...

PS Don't post if you do not have any characters post 50  ...
