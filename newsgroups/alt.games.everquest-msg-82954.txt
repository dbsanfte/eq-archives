Yes,  this is correct.

First you have to get to the Ry'Gorr fort. 

You run inside the wall and then around the back of the center
building. Behind the center building is a smaller building with a door
made of iron bars (like a cell). Click on the bars to open the door.
Inside is a single room with a white "snow-ball" crystal on a
pedastal. Click on the crystal to zone into CC.

It is best to make the run with SoW and Invis the first time. It's
simple once you have done it the first time.
