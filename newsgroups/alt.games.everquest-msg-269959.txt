My favourite spot was in oasis on top of the spectre tower. But it's
been quite a while now since I visited it. Maybe I should start a new
sightseeing thread. ;)

Btw, as good looking as the new sky is I miss the old one in PoD for
instance. I did run around there lately and was like...hm something is
wrong here. One minute later it registered - a blue sky in PoD!? I
really loved the old one. :)

But since there are a lot more bugs to fix I doubt I'll ever see the
"old" sky again. It could even be that it is on Kael Drakkal only...:/
