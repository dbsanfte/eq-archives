Actually, it was AC's loot system that made me ask. AC's loot was a bit 
different than SWGs. SWGs stats are based on the quality of the item (as 
determined by the quality of the materials that make up the item) - with 
a small bit of randomness, due to experimentation, thrown in. But this 
randomness only affects how high a particular stat was. This is a bit 
different than what I'm talking about.

In AC, loot items were truly random. In other words, you'd kill creature 
X and he'd drop a magic shield. They had a random treasure generator 
that would make that magic shield have some crazy random properties. 
Sometimes it would give you fire protection, sometimes cold protection, 
etc. In my opinion, that was one of the greatest strengths of AC. It'd 
give the players a reason to keep fighting.
