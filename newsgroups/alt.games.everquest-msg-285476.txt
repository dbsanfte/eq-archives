He was trying to spring more commission, or he was thinking EQ2 and
NWN2 (which probably wouldn't be very playable on a $600 laptop
either) - the difference between a Sempron/Celeron and a Turion might
be in the 20% range (a Core Duo will be considerably faster but that
probably gets you to $800 or so), but either should run EQ and NWN1
well enough that it's not an issue.  For more modern games I think the
GPU will be more of a problem in that price range.  Even for EQ it
might be an issue if you want to run with all the modern graphics
features on, but if you disable all that, keep the clip plane fairly
low, and run original models, I doubt there is anything mainstream
that EQ won't be playable on, and the graphics card will choke long
before the CPU.

Not that I've ever used a Sempron/recent Celeron, but I can't imagine
them being slower than the XP1800+ I used to run, and that could
handle EQ easily.
