Actually, the Invisible hand has been coopted for all kind of crazy
theories. I simply am pointing out supply nd demand.

Your point is taken. Been a few years since I had done anything with
the basics, my experience is mostly applied by now. This isn't an
academic group, thank God.

You must be trolling. 

I did not say that. I was pleased to see a way to spread the word. I
made no statement what he would think. He was a very religeous man and
no doubt, the mythos of EQ would have distressed him.

Karl marx could not praise the current system in China, he is very
dead, and I think he is too preoccupied.

The most amusing part is theological.The Sony-hating people are going
through hoops to state that Verant and Sony somehow are meddling with
the Captitalism in the bazaar for some nefarious reason. The seem to
have to cast them as a devil, like the FARC in Columbia cast the
Capitalist in the role of the oppressor...
