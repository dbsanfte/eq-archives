Ok, went to Hate this weekend, downloaded all the new updates to my
maps directory.  For those of you that dont know and do Have LoY...
http://maps.eq-toolbox.com  has all the zone maps for download.

Well, I zone in... pull my map, lo and behold, Maps not useable in
this zone?!?!?

soo, we have Hate as one zone they dont work in.... what others are
there?

and, is there a way via quest / item to have maps work in these zones?
I think I recall someone mentioning a "possible" quest for that.

This character has done the Cartography quest that starts in Freeport,
and the end items is basicly a no drop compass.  Of course I did not
have the compass on me when I went to hate so I cannot disqualify this
as a possible item.

As with all things, your time and insight are appreciated.
