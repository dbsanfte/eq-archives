Two days ago was the last time I survived because of my useless shammy
buffs.  I was working on completing the fourth shawl quest, when I found the
Kromriff Death Squad.  My brave pet distracted them for a couple of seconds,
giving me time to run, or so I thought.  I am not sure if I got summoned, it
happened pretty quick, either that, or they just run faster than sow speed.
They were smacking me around good, I cast gate, channelled through it (yes,
I know, people don't seem to believe it's possible to channel through being
beat on by reds, this is the fourth time I have succeeded.  Actually, every
time I have tried, I have succeeded in gating out of danger, unfortunately,
I don't normally have gate memorized unless I know I am heading into a very
dangerous situation.), and arrived in Thurgadin with 48 hp left.  I probably
would have survived without my stamina buff, but not without Altuna.  I
would imagine that my AC buff helped out as well, but that's a lot harder to
judge.  There is absolutely no question that without Altuna I would have
been dead.

I did run back, recast my pet, and complete the fourth shawl quest after
that, using the pet guard here, and attempt to drop an item trick to find
"You stumble is too far away to trade with."  Now I have to get my tailoring
up a bit.  Cured silk mask anyone?
