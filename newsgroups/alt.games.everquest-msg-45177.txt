It stands for NT File System, which was introduced with Windows NT, of
course. It basically allows for much better security, right down to
the file level. What that means is you can specify permissions for
certain users on specific files or folders. If you don't want anyone
to look at your special list of porn sites, for example, then you can
set a password on only that file, or restrict all other users but
yourself from accessing it. It's really quite nifty.

As for 2000 not being a gaming OS, that's a bunch of hogwash. I have
never had a problem running any game that can be played in Windows on
Win2K. Now, DOS games are a different story, since Win2K doesn't have
real DOS, only an emulator executable. So Doom is out. But Win2K does
a much better job at juggling memory and resources than 9x does. I can
even minimize EQ while medding by hitting the windows key, surf around
or do other stuff, and then get right back into EQ by using Task
Manager. For that reason alone Win2K is a great system to play EQ on.
