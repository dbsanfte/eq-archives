Without exception, every experience I've had with the in-game support
people has been pleasant and positive. Of course, I treat them
respectfully, and I have reasonable expectations of what they can and
cannot do.

We have your statements about the incidents, but no actual provable
transcript of the incidents. For all we know, you were rude or abusive
in your conversations with the support staff.

The fact that the support staff is limited in what they can do doesn't
make them useless pricks - they are following the rules set down for
them, that's all. To call them names over this fact is terribly poor
form.

And finally, of course, Guides are not paid. They are volunteers.
