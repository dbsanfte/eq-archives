I'm running EQ in Win XP Beta and it worked fine on release 2462, i am
having some probs with intermittant sound/keyboard lockups under 2465 though
:( - might be because i upgraded from 2462 - 2465 though.

I have run EQ under Win 2K and it ran fine, i'd go for the clean install -
although you don't say what Graphics card you are using - some nVidia
drivers don't like XP and i would guess the same is true of Win 2K - version
6.50 was particularly unstable - i'm currently running 10.80.

Hope you get it sorted, the stability of Win 2K is amazing after Win 98/ME
:)
