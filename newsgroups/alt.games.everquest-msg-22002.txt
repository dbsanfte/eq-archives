Rangers get to pull because they have tracking, which can show
which mobs are the closest along with their /con.    That makes
for a pretty steady stream of blues/whites because the ranger
gets to run right to their intended victim and pull it, instead of
stopping and conning everything they see.

Indoors, in my experience, monks make the best pullers.  Outside,
no one can beat a ranger.   Pulling from a fixed spawn site, however,
is pretty much "inside."   The group doesn't need the ranger's
skill in finding kills, it needs the monk's skill in avoiding trains.
