If you are on a LAN with others who play EQ too you should set up a 
proxy server with transparent proxying to the EQ patch server 
(patch.everquest.com TCP port 7000). This means as soon as one client 
patches his EQ from patch.everquest.com all the rest of the LAN clients 
get their patch files from the proxy server instead. This is what I have 
done at home and it does save a lot of download time and bandwidth. I am 
not sure but I suspect that since the EQ patcher uses IE, if you set 
your proxy settings in IE then the EQ patcher *may* use them, 
eliminating the need for transparent proxying. You also need to make 
sure your proxy server is set to cache large files.
