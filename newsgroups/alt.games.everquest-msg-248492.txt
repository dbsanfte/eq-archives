No I think the problem he is having is that Sony added some code that
makes you go LD if you swim straight in to a wall for very long...to
stop people from skilling up this way.

If you can't find a suitable current to swim against, you may be able
to swim in circles indefintely.  One shortcut to autorun is to press
your walk-forward button (up arrow or whatever you use) and hit enter,
"/", or whatever to start chatting.  Release the forward-button and
you will be autorunning.  Hit enter again if you like to get the
cursor out of the chat box.  You will keep running, just as if you had
hit the capslock key.  Here's the thing, at least on my computer (this
didn't work for a friend for some reason): You can also push the
move-forward button *and* a turn-left/right button using this same
technique.  You will now autorun and autoturn.
