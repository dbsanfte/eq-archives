Uh, think we're all aware of what ALT+TAB does, that is why this guy posted
the orginal question.

Ideally, you'd use ALT+TAB to switch between applications (IM, yahoo,
e-mail, whatever), and then bounce back to EQ.

Unforunately, EQ has trapped ALT+TAB and instead of a considerate "switch",
you get dumped back to windows and kicked out of EQ, not very nice.
