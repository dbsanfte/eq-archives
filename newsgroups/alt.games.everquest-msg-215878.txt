Hell - I get in trouble enough with my spellsets.

I have 4 sets of the bottom 4 spells and 4 sets
of the top - and they're hotkeyed.

Just before entering a dungeon I bring up my
pet set in the top 4 - and invariably forget to
bring in my standard combat set after I make a pet.

Next thing you know someone asks for a mod rod, I
target, tap the 7 key and hear the appropriate summoning
sound and forget about it.  A minute later the same
person says "Mod rod please?" and I say "Already gave
you one"  "um, no"  "you sure?  Check your bags, I'm
not summoning one until I know you don't have one"
..... then I see the Belt of Magi'Kot on my cursor 
"oops, nm, incoming rod"
