Too proud to twink, but perfectly willing to beg and harass other people?

I doubt it.   IMO at least, for most of them its a game.   They enjoy seeing
how far they can go with it, and how much they can convince others to give
them.   I'm sure they pass whatever they get back to thier main, but I really
think the begging itself is what they get off on.
