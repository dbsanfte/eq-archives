So I go to buy some fire opals from Genni (is there a regular vendor
anywhere now?  Handing 55p one at a time is annoying) and I come across a
little alter thing that slides to the side if you click on it, revealing a
fake wall.

So I go down there, down, down down, check out the sights...I see an efreeti
and I hail him

"Your Temple of Sol Ro faction has decreased."

DOH!  Oh yeah, I heard something about this like 2 years ago.  I went from
at least indiff (probably better after all this time) to Apprehensive, and
Genni wouldn't sell to me anymore.  Thankfully that's NOT a problem for an
enchanter, but still!

I'm not complaining, it's pretty cool and funny...I just wish I remembered
it BEFORE hailing him. :)
