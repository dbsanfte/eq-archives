I still wonder :

What EQ race and class is the old Christmass Man with his white beard 
and wearing the well known red armour ?

Some kind of gnome ( not realy I thing he work much with gnomes but he 
isn't by itself )

Some kind of high level barbarian beastman from north Haalas ? ( sound 
good but there are no know gnome there to work with him )

Is he neutral, good neutral, good ?

Someone to guess the stats on his fantastic backpack ?

By the way I checked the fireplace at my druid guild in Kelethin and 
there was no gifts. Asked to the guild trainer and I guess I forgot to 
bring some empty boots for that special yearly quest.

These where just some rough guess.
Feel free to add yours.
