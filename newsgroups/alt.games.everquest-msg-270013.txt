Well, one obvious answer is that the boss mobs are raised, just like
the players. What, you think Urgluck Crushskull, Ogre King, doesn't
have some high level priest friends?

(From channel Ogres_r00l)
Urgluck: This suxxorz. I was doing Ogre Forest, hoping for some easy
XP against all the n00bs that spawn there, when this group of reds
ppped and killed me in like 5 seconds.

Another answer is to design content where renewal makes sense. So you
have a randomizer that produces  hundreds of names for the "orc king",
and, when one dies, another one takes his place after a reasonable
time. 

Trying to make a world truly dynamic doesn't work. It screws over new
players who might wnat to do some of the great deeds. It would also
drive the cost through the roof -- creating that much new content
requires a lot of labour, and you can't really outsource quest
creation to India. :)
