Having been in this exact same situation in Crushbone as well, I used a
different solution.  I convinced the "camp stealers" that if they let me get
the item I was looking for, I would help them lvl.  I wasn't going to get
any XP, except from Emperor Crush which wasn't much, but I did want to get
the item.   Seeing the benefit of giving up one item, they agreed.  They
lvl'd and I got my item.

As the higher lvl toon, you can have a good deal to offer in terms of
helping them out, no matter what class you are.  Or you could have even
brought back your lower lvl toon to group them.

Lower lvl toons can't really "Camp Steal" from a higher lvl toon, but a
higher lvl toon can be a better player than a newbie.
