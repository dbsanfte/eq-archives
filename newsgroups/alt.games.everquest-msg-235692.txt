Family run farms are being eaten alive by corporate economies of scale
and an inability to effectively compete. If the objective is to be
self sustaining it doesn't really matter what your neighbour is able
to afford to sell his crops for.

That's sort of the point. You need a critical mass to be
self-sustaining.

Are we happier now?... strikes, mortgages, gas prices, smog, gangs,
bankrupty, drug addiction, terrorism... yep good times.

Ah the benefits of a greater modern society. The ability to cure, and
it will only cost you everything you'll ever produce for your entire
life. That knife cuts both ways. We spent millenia as a species coping
without the local hospital. It may be luddite to turn your back on
it... that doesn't make it wrong.

Possibly. I think this would be much more likely to succeed if he
could start it on a new frontier. Doing it In the middle of America
adds a challenge at the least.
