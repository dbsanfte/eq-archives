Verant hasn't had an official presence on the newsgroup since about month 6
of public release. Too damn many posts of "***IMPORTANT*** BRAD, YOU MUST
READ THIS" and "GORDON, IF YOU READ JUST ONE POST THIS YEAR, MAKE IT THIS
ONE"...and the content would be along the lines of "I don't like the color
red you used for the hair on barbarian female face #4, please change it or
I'll cancel my account".

I'm sure one (or more) people at verant read the newsgroup (looking for
bugs/player favorable drop issues/etc that they might not find out about
otherwise), and some may even post on it as "civilians", but we haven't
seen any official responses in a long, long time.
