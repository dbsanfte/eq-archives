My advice would be to zone into Timorous Deep on either the shuttle from
Butcherblock or the raft from Oasis. If possible, cast lev on yourself
just before you get on the boat (I know you don't get it until level 16,
but you may get lucky and find a 39+ mage to give you some of those
summoned 2 charge rings of flight...), now run or swim to the firepot
room in Timorous Deep. Having lev on will ensure that you don't fall for
any damage when you enter the room (the entrance is submerged and you
will fall through the ceiling of the room on entry - expect about a
200hp or so fall if not levved). Now, invis yourself and click on the
Cabilis firepot (gold vase on the right hand side when facing south).
This will teleport you instantly to Cabilis, you'll be in West Cabilis
just inside the Lake of Ill Omen zone (out of the way of the guards, but
best to have invis on anyway). Now you have a choice - run through to
East Cabilis and out into FoB, hoping invis doesn't drop, or just get
your non-KOS Iksar to the spot in West Cabilis where your enchanter
ported to, make the trade, then gate your enchanter the hell out of
there.

This way cuts out all the running through nasty places like Dreadlands
or Firiona Vie. There is a slim possibility of being eaten by Faydedar
in Timorous Deep, but I shouldn't worry, he's a triggered spawn now and
is pretty much leapt on by high levels when he's up - I've never run
into him.

See www.eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousteleport.html for more info on the
firepot room.
