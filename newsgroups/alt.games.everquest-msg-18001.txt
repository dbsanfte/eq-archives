Excelent.

Must try harder.

The 1hb you really should improve.
The swimming could use some work.
An hour or so of practice should get divination up.
Conjuration should improve naturally.
No Dodge ? Should have got this at Level 15 
No Tracking ? You get this at 20
No trade skills ?
No Forage Should have got this at 15

As far as practice points go there is no point in using them on the
skills that you already have.

Ah the 6 levels of no training explaines the lack of dodge Forage and
tracking.
I recomend that you put some points into each of these.
People will argue different ways of learning skills.
Some say put lots of points in to "kick start" you learning.
Some say put only one point in and learn in the field.

I think that basically if you don't plan on learning a trade skill soon
then dump as many points into each as you can.
The next new skill that you get is specialise at 30.
Lots of time to save up points.

I would probably put 10 in each skill.
Im not sure how easy it is to raise Tracking (as I don't have it yet
<G>)
I do know that raising forage is a PITA.
Dodge will go up with fighting.

After you have these skill I would suggest spending some of your next
few levels points in 1hb to get it to 20 then practice with these
weapons.

I would recomend soloing for a bit. That should give you a chance to
practice dodge, defence, 1hb and conjouration.

HTH,

Jim
