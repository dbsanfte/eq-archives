As someone who played Everquest for about 5 years, played EQ2 for a
few months, and played WoW from about a month after it came out till
right now, I wonder what your basis is for this comparison that
Everquest is for the educated elite, and WoW is for "the drooling
masses".  I'm sorry, but I just don't see it, and whenever I've
challenged such a statement, I've never gotten back anything other
than "cause I say so".

Is it enormously easier to level in WoW than in EQ?  Well, that's the
popular perception... but I wonder.  I recall that when LDoN came out
in EQ, my enchanter was in his 40s.  What I found was that 2 LDoNs
(say at most 3 hours) was a level.  I can guarantee you that's faster
than my characters level in their 40s in WoW.  It did get slower to
level via LDoN as I moved up, but even at 59 it was about 10 LDoNs per
level, maybe 10 hours (at most) which is comparable to WoW.

So... is EQ more complex than WoW?  Better boss encounters?  Better
back story?  Better quests?  Better crafting? Just saying that it
appeals to lots of people so it MUST be dumb doesn't work... by that
measure, Everquest, which was the 800 lb gorilla of its time, must
have also been dumbed down.

Ok, gotta go level my rogue... may we all enjoy the game of our
choice.

By the way... if you are comparing WoW to chess, I'm impressed... WoW
would certainly be in good company in that case!
