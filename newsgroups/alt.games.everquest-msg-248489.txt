The key, which SOE hasn't learned yet, is that in order to keep things
fresh, you don't need to keep adding expansions, you need to change the
world itself, you need to keep it dynamic.  The old world is stale and
boring and the new expansions tend to obsolete the old world.  The result
is that the world grows past the ability of the population to keep it
feeling like a real, living, breathing place.  And that's why we play EQ
(or *played* EQ) instead of playing single-player games.  And when the
world grows so much, all of a sudden you find yourself needing Grand
Central Station aka Plane of Knowledge, to make travel easier, but all
that does it dumb down the game even more.  The trip from A to B might
not seem so dreary and boring if every once in a while something new
happened.  Leveling an alt wouldn't be so mundane if Crushbone wasn't
exactly the same as it has been in the last X years.  Etc.  Just my
meandering thoughts...
