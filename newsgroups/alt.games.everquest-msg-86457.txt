Not too long ago, my small guild did a mini-raid on Sol A for some quest 
items.  We're barely in there ( had just jumped through the hole in the 
wall ) and our guild leader is explaining things about Sol A to those who 
hadn't been there before.

The last thing she said before respawning at her bind point was along the 
lines of "And be careful walking in some areas, it's easy to fall in lava 
if you aren't careful in some places."

You can guess how she died a few seconds later.
