And ?

Do you REALLY have that bad a time knowing there are people out there,
recklessly playing MMORPGs ?

Why not take up something that could actually affect someone's lfe in
a meaningful way - charity work, train to be a nurse, become a
crossing guard.

Something, ANYTHING, rather than posting to newsgroups about how
they're wasting their time playing MMORPG's.

At the very least, give up trying to convince people that's they're
*not actually enjoying themselves !*.

Or go and masturbate - you'll be a lot calmer afterwards.
