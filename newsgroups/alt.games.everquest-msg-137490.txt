DSL is broadband actually - you're referring to cable. I like DSL better 
personally. Cable is faster and cheaper in my area but doesn't offer any 
personalizations such as domain forwarding (for custom domains) or static 
IPs. It's also more reliable around here, my DSL has never lag spiked or 
gotten less than full speed. Granted its full download speed isn't as fast 
as cable, but for gaming it's more than enough bandwidth and offers good 
pings :)
