 I find Kaesora fun. We had a regular group there around level 35 or so
and would do camps like library and church. The faction hits are a bit
of a discouragement to some. I don't know why the spiders (and some of
(but not all) the ghosts) in Kaesora give -VenrilSathir faction anyway.
It doesn't really make much sense but I suppose there could be some
history I don't know about.
