Easiest as a warrior would be what my level 1  - 56 characters can do
on any server; buy stuff from NPC vendors, which players sold them,
then sell such things  in the bazaar. 

Its possible to buy like 80 spiderling silks just in Neriak, tons of
bone chips, etc. At various npc vendors you can find tons of other
things that sell well such as low to high quality cat and bear hides.

I used to mainly make a neriak/east commons and freeport run, getting
enough things to sell them in the bazaar overnight and make over 400
plat easily.

Since you are a warrior, at level 25, you could also give the rapid
beatdown to such creatures in passing. Any cat/bear or
spider/spiderling you pass in the EC/WC and Nek forest area should be
killable by you in a couple hits. So while checking out vendors you
will be getting more such items in passing. I'd not bother with the
ruined hides, they are for patchwork and are too abundant on npcs.

It works best if you have a neriak friendly(dark elf city) character,
but if not the commons are still good. 

There used to be more, then none, then now I think they changed it
again to nine NPC "hidden" spots. So you buy out stacks of cheap junk
to free up another slot on the NPC vendor. Then you get out of the
trade thing with them and reopen them, showing a new item. That is how
you might find a ton of hides/silks on a vendor previously not showing
them. I've been out of the game for a bit and not quite sure if it
still works that way.
