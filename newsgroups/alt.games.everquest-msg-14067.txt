Enchanter dead, a minor critter hitting the cleric so that he keeps getting
interrupted while casting CH (I would hope he'd only try CH once, but that's
10 seconds shot), and having a bear of a time getting off something less
(don't know enough about cleric heals to venture a more specific guess).

We did that elemental in burning woods for cleric quest a few clerics.  The
cleric in our group started casting CH on our warrior (with 3200hp) the
moment he started being hit (at 90% health).  He died before the CH
completed.  Cleric still had LOTS of mana left (thank god, considering the
other warrior needed heals).
