Any dot with a debuff component won't stack - that's why bard chants
don't stack, as they have debuffs built in.

The reasons I'm sticking with my BL for my 2nd box are two-fold:

1.  Pet classes can be played in a very hands off manner:  IE without
looking at the screen.  Given an appropriate set of hotkeys he can slow,
nuke, dot, and send his pet in without me having to constantly switch
computers.  This is very effective while I'm duoing the two of them.

2.  When I'm in a standard group with a healer and tank I can switch
over to botting my mage (again pretty hands off - malo, pet kill, nukes,
DS's and rods can all be handled with hotkeys) and get down and smack
the mob around a little bit on the BL.
