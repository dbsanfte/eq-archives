  How do the racial/professional experience penalties and bonus play
out in today's EQ?

  I've seen the sites which calculate the experience needed to level
based on race and profession.  I also remember it being said that
group experience would be divided based upon the amount of experience
of each group member... a larger cut of the experience pie going to
whoever had more experience.

  In the old days, this was a major point of complaint for hybrids.  I
know, however, that Verant made changes that more or less alleviated
most of the grievances people had with the old experience system.

  I'm unclear on exactly how they did this though.

  I've been told that what they have essentially done is left the
amount of experience needed to level the same as it always has been,
but gave those professions (and races?) with penalties a bonus equal
to their penalty.  So a wood elven ranger who needs 40% more exp to
level (than say a wood elven druid) who kills something that normally
would garner them 100 exp, will instead get 140 exp.

  However, I'm a little unclear on two points.  First, I know that the
experience "bonuses" for Halflings were left in place, along with the
bonus to warriors and rogues.  Were the racial penalties removed,
however?  I can't quite remember what the producer's letter said on
this subject.

  Second, is experience still based upon the total amount of
experience a character has?  If so, it seems something is still a bit
out of whack, because then that level 35 troll shadow knight is still
taking roughly as much experience as a level 42 wood elven warrior.
Maybe that isn't a big deal, but as I recall it was the main issue
that non-hybrids had with the penalties as they stood.

  Thanks.
