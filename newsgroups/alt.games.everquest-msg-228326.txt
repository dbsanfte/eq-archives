Clerics do DPS also.

But rogues, rangers, monks, mages, necromancers, wizards do a good deal 
=more= DPS, which is why they are the "DPS classes"

If you have a druid who isn't called on to be healer, he'll do more DPS 
than a warrior.

If you have a cleric who isn't called on to be healer, he'll do more DPS 
than a warrior (only at some levels, at other levels a cleric will never 
outdamage a warrior.)

If you have an enchanter or bard who aren't called on to do CC, they'll 
do more DPS than a warrior (assumes charmable mob handy.)

Against undead, a paladin may well outdamage a warrior.

Being able to outdamage shadowknights, shamans, and paladins does not 
mean you are a "DPS Class".

Note that the above are assuming average gear; a warrior twinked out 
with 41 haste and uber weaponry will be able to outdamage many of the 
above classes if they are dawdling along in 22% haste gear and average 
weaponry (melee) or without its equivalent in focus gear and FT gear 
(casters)
