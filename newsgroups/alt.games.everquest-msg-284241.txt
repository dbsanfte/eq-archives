     I saw one "can I have your stuff" response, and one "you beat me to
it" reply.  I did see several replies that appeared to be well thought
out critiques of your starting post.  Do you equate every post that
doesn't agree with your sentiments to be a "Can I have your stuff"
reply?

   What kind of responses were you hoping for, or do believe that you
ought to have gotten?  Did you expect everyone to reply with "Hey! 
You're right.  I just now realized, the game sucks!  Thanks for pointing
that out; I'm out of here now too."

   I quit playing EQ a couple of years ago because I got burned out, and
have no desire at all to return.  Fine, that sort of thing happens,
people scatter, life goes on.  The game certainly has changed over the
years.  Some feel that most of the changes have been for the better,
some feel that very soul of EQ has been altered forever and can never be
recaptured.  But even if the devs did restore the game to the way it was
at release things could never be the same.  There are many other popular
MMORPG's now.  People have choices and  EQ will not be at the top of
everyone's list.  The player base in general is much more educated as to
the most "efficient" way to play.  And there are those that are simply
going to get burned out and leave, no matter how the game is altered.

   BTW, I really, really, _don't_ want your stuff.
