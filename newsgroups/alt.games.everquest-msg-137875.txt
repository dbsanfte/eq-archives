Actually, it is ok. If someone accidently drops their wallet and I
find it, I am not legally obligated to return it and am breaking no
law if I keep it. If I did actually find a wallet in the street, I
would probably take the cash and mail the wallet back to it's owner. I
would be happy if someone would do the same for me.

Theft is indeed theft, but this is not theft. You are correct in
saying there is no gray area. This is clearly not theft. It may be
morally questionable, but not theft.
