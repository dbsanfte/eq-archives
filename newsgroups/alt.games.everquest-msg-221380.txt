I play a level 48 Druid on Stromm, and I have often been the main healer in
my groups. It can be done.

I do admit to grabbing a clarity, and now that I am 45+, a KEI whenever
possible.

The key is making sure you have a good MT who is almost the only one getting
hit. And an enchanter or bard (who knows what they are doing!! been with
some bad ones the past couple nights) for crowd control.

One of my biggest pet peeves since ldon is sending a tell to someone to join
group, and then they respond with "Do you have a cleric"? At this point,
they get no response from me...even if we have one.
