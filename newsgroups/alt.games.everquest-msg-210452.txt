I use the Staff of Four between fights, Forceshield during if an AOE knocks
off the epic effect.  Recast time on wizard epic is too long; if a wizard's
forte is supposed to be fast damage, losing that much time means I'm not
doing my job.  Also, SotF's effect has HUGE aggro all out of proportion to
the effect; I like to click it during fights to tease my favorite SK tank
about not generating enough hate - if it goes off in the first quarter of
the mob's health, I'll pull it off him.  /chuckle  Ticks him off no end.

Enchanter epic is a fantastic peice of resist gear, like all epics; I intend
to finish my chanter's, but doubt I'll use it for anything but newb buffing.

I'm five drops away from my bard's epic, rather looking forward to it.
That's one that will get used.
