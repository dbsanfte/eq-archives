    Dachunker is the largest tank in our guild. Last night I was with
Dachunker, a shaman, a wizard, and two enchanters in Acrylia doing AoE. I
don't even want to think about how much damage he was churning out - he was
knocked linkdead after one big swing with spells on so he could log his
damage. I think he said he was doing something between 4000 and 5000 DPS
over the 31 second duration of the fight whose log is at that link.

    And yes, it was the fastest XP I'd ever seen in my life. Ping, Venerable
Delores Mulva! :-)
