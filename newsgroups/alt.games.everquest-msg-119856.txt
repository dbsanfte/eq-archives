Yeah.  You need to go up there with people doing the reavers.  I went on an
open-invite CoM raid to get mine.  When we got into the zone, there happened
to be an uber-guild up in the reavers spot, and the Wraith of Jaxion was up.

They were nice enough to CoH me up there and let me do the turn-in.  But
it's still a pain.

I got me a Robe of Dark Beguilement off Nathyn Illuminous.  Makes me look
like a necro, but I can live with that.
