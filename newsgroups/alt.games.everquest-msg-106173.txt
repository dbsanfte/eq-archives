Why worry then? The change will be that you have to be at least 50 or 
51 to get the regen (if there is a change)

Guess what that means for you?

1) you can give YOUR fungi which won't change to a twink of yours
OR sell it for 100 k plat or more.

2) you can buy the NEW level 50 plus fungi which will perform the same
for you for about 5 k plat or less.

A WINNER IS YOU!!!
