No the plat cheat was using the shared bank, this cheat was an xp
expoit that allowed you to level quickly. Two different cheats, one
affected the game massivly the other didnt, will leave to your
imgination which is which. Not sure how much plat has been duped but
one rumor puts it at almost doubling on some servers. Think Xev was
hit the hardest as it also suffered from the shark thing a while back.
Least I got out before the collapse but wouldnt wish this on anyone.
Wonder if they have any ideas how to correct this mess or not.
