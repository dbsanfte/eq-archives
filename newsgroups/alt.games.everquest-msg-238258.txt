   I know.  I'm sorry.

   See, when I posted it, I thought it would turn into an interesting discussion
on how some extremist and even moderate christians can view D&D players, any by
extension, Everquest players.  Stupidly, it did not occur to me that it would
turn into a never ending argument about God in general.  If I had known, I would
have at least marked it as OT.  But if it had gone the way I thought it
logically would, then it would have indeed been on topic.

  But yeah.  F-1, /smack!
