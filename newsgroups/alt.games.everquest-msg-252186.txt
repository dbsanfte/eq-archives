"This incident has been reported to the FBI Internet Fraud
Department, and tomorrow to the RCMP. We have compiled as much
information as possible on this person, including his name, address,
phone number, email addresses and the IPs used to log into our
site. All of this information will be turned over to the
authorities."

" NOTE: Any employees of CCP or Sony Online Entertainment (or any
  other game publisher for that matter) are encouraged to contact
  us. We know we violate your user agreement - we just want this
  behaviour to stop! It hurts everyone, *including* your paying
  clients! I know you have detailed transaction records proving
  exactly when and where those transactions were made. This
  information could help get the ball rolling. Linden Lab has worked
  with this. So can you!"

They haven't conceded defeat _against the scammer_, only against
Paypal.  Which, as far as I am concerned, is a good thing, since it is
one less seller of plat, and I do feel some schadenfreude at them
being punished for what they're doing.  But that doesn't mean I
support the scammer - I don't like vigilanteism, which is the best
this could be (in the worst[1] case, he sold the money on and made a
pretty penny, making it just plain fraud).
