As with all rules, this depends on the mood of the GM who answers the
petition. My old guild on E'Ci (SotS) was disbanded for precisely that
action - leapfrogging to get to an un-engaged mob first (Trakanon and
VS)

We never argued that is was a 'nice' thing to do, so don't bother
resurrecting that flamefest. It was rude, and apparently, enough against
the rules to disband the guild, flag the guildname to NEVER be recreated
on any server, and soulmark the officers to never be allowed officer
status in any other guild. 

The 'rules' are open to interpretation or change at any time, on the
whim of GMs, and there is zero recourse for appeal. You're in their
world now. Thankfully, when we moved to Zeb, and new GM staff, we had no
problems whatsoever, and found nothing but helpful assistance in general
from the VI staff. As with all 'human' reliance, the atitude of the
person in charge, and how they wield they power, determines the real
implementation, rather than the written word.
