Ho hum.

It was versus Klandicar and the log was from a now retired friend of
mine, my original reply was to illustrate that Rangers could (against
some raid targets) outdamage Monks *in certain circumstances*.  Not
too many believed me at the time, I guess more do now.

Monks still do far more damage toe-to-toe [tanking even] than anyone
else, Rogues can do astounding damage from the rear(ish) arc and
Rangers -- with a crapload of AA points -- can do astounding damage
from distance.  Sometimes.
