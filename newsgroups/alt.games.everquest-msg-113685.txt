I went back to play my bard last night, and as I was running through Dagnors
Cauldron, I slipped into 3rd person view.
To my surprise, and delight, I had a bongo drum under my arm and I was
playing it like a good thing! :)
Is this just since the last patch? Or was it patched a long time ago and I
just never noticed?
