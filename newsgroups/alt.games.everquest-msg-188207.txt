If you don't want to download a huge file, you can buy The Everquest Trilogy
CD. It retails for $10, comes with the game and the first 2 expansions
(Kunark + Velious), and I believe one free month. It's a pretty fair deal.
EQ is $12.95 per month after that.

I'm mostly a newbie myself (my highest is only level 13 ATM), and here's how
I see the expansions:

Here's a quick breakdown on the expansions:

Everquest (the base game) - you need this to play.

The Ruins of Kunark - adds a new continent (Kunark), and a new race (Iksar -
lizard people). Only useful for a newbie if you plan to play as an Iksar.

The Scars of Velious - adds another new continent (Velious), which is
intended for characters of levels 35+. Not useful for a newbie.

The Everquest Trilogy includes all three of the above.

The Shadows of Luclin - adds the moon (Luclin), a new race (Vah Shir - cat
people), and a new class (Beastlord). Also includes a new graphics engine
which replaces all of the character graphics, and upgrades all of the zone
textures. Most of the Luclin zones aren't too useful for a true newbie
(unless you play as a Vah Shir), but it does have the Bazaar (makes trading
with other players much easier), and you can hop continents a little easier.
The new graphics engine is also nice, but make sure you have 512 MB of RAM
and a good video card.

The Planes of Power - adds a bunch of new planes (dimensions). Intended for
players of levels 45+. Also adds the Plane of Knowledge which makes travel
much, much faster and easier. Mostly useless for a newbie - except for the
travel.

Everquest Gold includes all five of the above.

The Legacy of Ykesha - adds a few new zones, new playable race (Frogloks -
frog people), a cartography system, and some other nicknacks. The new zones
are intended for players of levels 35+. Only available via download. Most
useful if you want to play as a Froglok, but the cartography system might
help be nice too.

Personally, I only own EQ + Kunark + Luclin. I'll probably get Ykesha for
the Cartography system soon.
