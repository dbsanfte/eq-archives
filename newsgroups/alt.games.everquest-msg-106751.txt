Pleasure - getting 3 dark blue kills on one bubble of mana.

Annoyance - Fatally finding out that my new Charm spell takes too long
to cast when the mob's charging (and being too stupid to run for zone
when I figured it out).

Pulse-pounding - Sending your dark blue pet to attack a red target, it
gets one hit in, then your Charm wears off.  Beat both of them to
zone, though.

Why is it that I never see Druids using Charm, except when they
occasionally use it to KS someone?
