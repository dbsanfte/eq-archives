The Lion Paw drops off Pumas in EC and NRo. I killed a lot in NRo, and
didn't get the paw so switched to EC and got it within hours. From
conversations with other players, all who got one, got it from spawns
very close to the tunnel entrance. I'm in that category as well. I got
mine just to the left of the tunnel.....
