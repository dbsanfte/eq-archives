 No one has yet done better than the glass / vacumn thermos .
 It is the ONLY way to keep food warm .
  all other methods lose heat at much higher rates and cool
 in 20 minutes ....

 Peltier diodes are not worth it . They have  low performance
and will kill batteries quickly .
 If they had less leak .... but they dont want to add a water cooled
side on the outside .
   Even then , it would not compete with amonia absorbtion ( Dometic)
 There is nothing easier to make that cools food , but the government
has friends like Dupont et al , so they outlaw anyone to make it
 in the USA .   So the Swedes do it .
   Dupont makes 134a , their patent ran out for R12 , so they had to
cobble
 crap together to make the inferior R134a .

 IsoButane is avail everywhere , charge your system and then slowly
 add propane to bring pressure up to that of R12 , use same oil .
          50 million dollar penalty ., 20 to life .....
  Notice butane /propane are NOT CFC's !

 No govt pedals more dangerous drugs and meds than the US govt .
 No govt do mo ho than da US govt .  No govt murders more innocent
 people than the Roman Empire of the 20th century ....


  BTW Walmart is peddling $1  DVD's .
  [  Gorillas ...from the heart of darkness]  is worth 10 times that !
  If ya like Nature/ documentary / National Geo stuff .
  and

[ two worlds manatee and lion fish ]  is good also .
 DigiView entertainment , about 60 ins
