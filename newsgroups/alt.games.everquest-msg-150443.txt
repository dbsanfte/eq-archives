Yep, and they also made priest class only one handers which
are even better than that, to compensate for us not having
dual attack or a damage bonus; if I could put my 22/20 weapon
in your hands you'd be a killing machine!  Sadly,all such
weapons have been superceded by the little summoned hammer
line with the astonishing proc rate.

On the other hand, I gave up two handers some time ago because
it was impossible to find one with the stat/resist/hp/mana/AC bonuses
that a weapon plus secondary item combination would yeild.

For a knight, the same principle should apply only more so; your
class is designed to take damage, not deal it out, having two
sets of bonus should be even more important to you than to me.
Further, your class is designed to get aggro fast and hold it, when
the chips are down; show me the two hander that swings anywhere
near as fast as even a half decent one hander... I don't care
about your damage ratio for this purpose.  Two handers are for
when you really really DONT want to aggro, slower and who
needs the bonuses if you arent' getting hit.  I'd hope they would
do more damage than your best one hander, since in this mode
damage is all you are putting out anyway, and you are sacricing
stats and bash for the capability to do so.

Not saying thats how it does work... just that that is how it
-should- work IMO
