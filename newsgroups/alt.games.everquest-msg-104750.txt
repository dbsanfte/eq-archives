Ok, this is the problem I have here.  I don't think they need to give
druids anything (a lower mana, faster casting heal would be NICE, but
not necessary), but the reasons that people feel druids need to be
changed stem from the fact that people keep perpetuating the belief
that druids don't have any use in 50+ groups.  This is untrue.  

No, we don't DS as well as a Mage, but we still have a pretty damned
nice DS if a mage isn't available.

No, druids don't have all the ports that wizards have, but then again
Wizards don't have SoW or SoE either, which makes traveling once
you've gotten to your port spot MUCH easier.

No, druids don't nuke as well as wizards, but we're only second on the
list of nukers.  That's still pretty nice.

No, druids don't heal as well as clerics, but a druid can keep a MA
alive long enough for the cleric to med up for another CHeal or two.
And Chloroplast + PoN on a Necro/Shaman means they're gonna have a lot
more mana to do what then need to.

A druid bring a LOT to a group.  You just have to know what you're
doing.
