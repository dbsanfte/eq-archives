It's pretty much impossible to deal with a situation like this without
screwing some people, so the best they can do is try to make it so no one is
overly screwed.

Here's what I would do if I were in charge.  This assumes that the databases
are reasonable.

1. All servers down for emergency maintainence, to prevent further spread of
the tainted wealth.

2. Go through the database and for each character, and save a list of all NO
DROP items they have, all spells they have scribed, how much plat they have,
and whether or not they were played during the time the exploit was active.

3. Roll back from backups to a time before the exploiting (if the exploiting
has been going on a long time, then to a time before it became significant)
every character that was played during the time of exploiting.  For sake of
discussion, let's say they have to roll back 3 weeks.

4. For each character that is rolled back,

    A. Give that character an amount of XP that a typical hardcore XPing
    player of their level could earn in 3 weeks.  If this amount of XP gain
    is more than 1/2 of what it would take to get to where the character was
    in step #2, take them all the way.

    B. Give that character an amount of plat that a typical hardcore farmer
    of their level could earn in 3 weeks.  If this is more than 1/2 of the
    amount needed to take the character to where they were at #2, take them
    all the way.

    C. Compare their inventory to that saved in step #2, and restore any
    missing NO DROP items and and missing spells.

I might also save tradeskill skill levels in #2 and restore those in #4, if
there is no indication that the exploits were somehow used to boost
tradeskill values.

I might extend #4 and apply it to all characters, even those that did not
need to be rolled back, so that the people that are still screwed at least
get a windfall of XP and plat on their alts.

The basic idea here is that to fix something like this, if you don't have
the logs to just go back and undo all transactions involving the tainted
plat, you've got to do a rollback, but to make that less painful, you give
everyone rolled back (or everyone, period) some XP and plat.  If that XP and
plat grant is something that people could reasonably earn during that time,
it won't be screwing up the economy too much, and will leave *most* people
ahead of where they were before the rollback, so you won't have too
widespread a player revolt.  NO DROP can be handled specially so that people
can keep NO DROP loot they won after the rollback time.

I'd also consider while the server is down trying to put in an emergency
patch to the banking system that introduces a time delay between depositing
a large amount of plat and the availability of all that plat...kind of like
in real life, when you deposit a $2000 check via the ATM, you might only be
allowed to immediately withdraw $200, and the rest doesn't become available
until the bank verifies the funds.  Checks could then be done on deposits to
see if they are suspiciously large, and if so, GMs could be notified and
investigate during the hold period, and hopefully catch dup bugs while the
plat is still in guilty hands.
