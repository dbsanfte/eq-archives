All of the above people are wrong!!!
Get all stats to 75 minimum (this bit is correct).
Put the rest in Stamina. Sta is hard to raise with equipment and it gives
you more HP which to a tank is the second most important thing after AC. At
level 60 each of these extra STA points will give you 6hp.
Agi is also hard to raise with equipment but it's effect is more marginal.
With base 140 STR putting ANY points into it is a crime especially when
considering how easy the stat is to raise with kit (my warrior has never
chosen an item for its STR boost alone, and as a human has 180STR unbuffed).
