Sadly, no, that isn't what I'm saying.

I'm saying that I do what I am comfortable with, and what I prefer.

I could care less whether people top or bottom post (unless they post
something like "I agree" at the bottom of three pages of text...or even on
top of it.....)

Should I sermonize you on why top posting is better? Why bother? We're
obviously not going to agree on the matter, and it's a truly useless and
overdone arguement. It ranks up there with complaining about 1k messages
that were posted in html.

And in closing, as a special aside to Dark Tyger - there's this little thing
called "respect" you ill-bred, illiterate, litterbox reject.
