  Yep, the Dreadlands are a good standby, a last resort if you can't manage
to scrape up a group between your friends and guildmates, and if there
aren't any groups accepting new members in your preferred zones and it looks
like it'll stay that way.

  However, it sounds like this person is going to be setting up in the
Dreadlands as the area where he's going to be spending the majority of his
time... which would be kind of a shame, in my opinion.  The loot is pretty
lame, the zone is boring and the quality of player, generally, is probably
going to be a bit lower than what you might find in other zones.
