Go to, uh, Maiden's Eye.  If you try to go into any dungeons for the tasty
creamy goodness inside, you'll probably get yourself and others killed since
your question is commonly asked by the zombie grinders who go from 10 to 50
in Oasis/LOIO/FM/OT/DL.

However assuming you aren't a dungeon newbie who trains every 5 minutes,
Karnors castle, Velketor's Labyrinth, (on some servers) Chardok, and Sebilis
(depending on class, you may have to wait until higher).  Also Lower Guk and
Solusek B (Nagafen's Lair) are not yet green, semi-decent exp.
