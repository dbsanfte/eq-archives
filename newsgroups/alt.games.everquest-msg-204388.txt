I agree, but...

I was firmly in total agreement with you until recently.  I've
had a number of experiences that modified my view lately, while
having to be main healer as a Druid (yes I know, not identical
case because my heals are less efficient and I don't get HoTs).
- I've watched helplessly as group members died because I _had_
to save mana to heal the MT or we were gonna wipe.
- I've had an MT die because I ran out of mana (I went out and
boosted my mana pool by a heal-and-a-half as fast as I could
after this one, the MT was my guildleader).
- I've sufferred two TPWs because I ran out of mana before we
ran out of adds (I think the GL's trying to train everybody who
groups with him for raids, he basicly doesn't call for evac).

So now I hold to a modified version of your position:  So long
as your mana pool is large enough, its size doesn't matter.
The problem with just saying that it's overrated is that it can
be rather unpleasant to discover that you have underrated it.

As for specific cases, when you go dungeon diving without a
mezzer it's hard to overrate your healer's mana pool.

I'll tell you what.  If your AC is 300 lower than some Druid wearing
leather textured tissue paper you are gonna be in a world of hurt if
a mob decides to see what's inside your shiny little shell.  In a
high 30s group, fighting blue con mobs that did not hit extra hard,
I've seen a Cleric die faster than I could cast a Greater Heal.  In a
mid 50s group fighting a single mid 50s melee mob who tripled for 294
I've seen a Cleric destroyed even with a Paladin trying to save her.
Clerics that ignore AC (and HP) are less survivable and thus less
effective.
