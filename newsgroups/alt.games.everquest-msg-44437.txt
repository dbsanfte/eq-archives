    The boat passengers also regularly move around, and if you spend time on
the boats you notice them blink back in when they move, then blink out after
a while of not moving again. That's why I wonder if it's Hide and not some
simple Invis.

    I've survived that, again, by not moving at all on the trip. Gornit
never changed con to me - indifferent - whereas I've moved around before and
had him scowling.
