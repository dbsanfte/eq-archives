The enjoy the huge marketshare because they have the huge marketshare. 
Perhaps at one point it was the best feature/value/performance ratio, 
but now its just a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can't erode their 
marketshare because everything else 'needs windows'. You can't make a 
viable 'alternative to windows' because you can't make it run 3rd party 
applications, becuase those 3rd party applications are tied to 
proprietary windows interfaces and APIs.

Other than the fact that it is the de facto standard it is not 'better'. 
And being the de facto standard *is* a compelling reason to buy it, no 
matter how inferior it is.

Most corporations I've dealt with in the last few years do not choose 
Microsoft because it is the 'better OS', they choose it because they 
can't not choose it. They need it to run a specific peice of software, 
connect to a specfic piece of hardware, and in a few tragic cases were 
driven to it because the Microsoft Licensing Plan they were stuck in was 
making them purchase Windows OS licenses for the Macs onsite anyways 
(check out Microsofts licensing for Schools!!)

One positive at least... lately I've seen more and more people switching 
to Open Office, to avoid the exorbant licensing fees for Office.

And why are they doing this? We've had alternative office suites 
forever? Even if MS Office was 'the best' it wasn't 10 times better, but 
that is what it cost (vis a vis Corel Office), and most people certainly 
don't need 9)% of the features found in MS Office... EVER.

Because OpenOffice finally delivers adequate interoperability with the 
de facto MS Office standard. A large company can purchase one copy of MS 
Office for a room of computers for the odd 'tricky document that don't 
work', and deploy OpenOffice to the other 99 stations in the office, and 
save around $20,000 or more, every couple years.
