After several emails to tech support, and several useless solutions I
finally got the triuth from VI.
Below is their response to my query about bugged Velious Graphics with the
Luclin Models:

"Hello,

"We are aware of the issues with the armor and are hoping that they will
be addressed in an upcoming patch. Because of the new character models,
we were unable to include the Velious armor graphics as the unique
armors they were. The memory requirements to add these armors would have
increased the system requirements even more and would have been
unfeasible.

Adding the armors in the future is a possibility and something we are
looking at but for now, if you want to see the Velious armors as unique,
you will have to remove all Shadows of Luclin character models."
