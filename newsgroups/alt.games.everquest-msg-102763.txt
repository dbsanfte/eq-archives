Hi all-I was wondering if anyone out there knows of any faction difficulties I
may have trying to run my big arsed ogre warrior from the Grimling Forest to
the Scarlet Desert. I have to go thru Katta Castellum, and an Iksar friend was
killed as soon as he zoned in. Now I know Iksars aren't as handsome as us
ogres, and not as liked either :-),  but I want to avoid an untimely death if I
can-

Thanks in advance
