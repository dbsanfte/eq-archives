I actually liked that summary. :) Diss semantics all you want, but they're 
practically all that matters on USENET.

}No, he didn't.  Read the post we're discussing.  Remington based this post
}on the fact that Faned omitted a statement that the scammer kept the
}platinum from the original post.  Most likely since he figured it was
}understood.

No, the problem wasn't that he omitted the statement, presuming it was 
understood.  The problem was that he stated, quite specifically, that 
taking a refund was theft, regardless of any other circumstances, and that 
it therefore is not subject to the same due process that we would use to 
determine whether a killing was murder, for example.  He was specifically 
trying to justify, that in this particular instance, we can say for 
certain that a crime was committed.  Those debating with him claim that we 
cannot say for certain until the ownership issue is cleared up.  
Neglecting to mention the ownership issue at all and claiming proof then 
becomes rather suspect, doesn't it?  He's saying the ownership issue is 
irrelevant, and that any who voice support for the buyer -clearly- have no 
moral compass since they are unwilling to convict on the basis of there 
having been a refund alone.

Which is silly.  Since clearly, it all comes down to the ownership issue, 
as usual.
