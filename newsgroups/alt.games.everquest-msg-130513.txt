1/3 will help you cos they want to help, 1/3 will help cos they feel
pressured into doing so, and the other 1/3 will tell you to take a hike or
ignore you. People hate door to door salesman and telemarketers for exactly
the same reason, cos its "in your face" and it puts them under pressure.
Some people wont take no for an answer either, and get all hostile.
Personally it doesnt bother me, but unless I feel like typing, dont expect a
reply (and then accuse me of not being courteous)
