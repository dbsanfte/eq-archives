there are merchants in most (all?) starting cities, as well as PoK and
PoTranq that sell gate potions.  they cost something like 1250pp.

alternately, if they're not KoS to coldain, they can raise their pottery
skill to about 122 for about 35pp and make thurgadin gate potions for about
20pp each.  check out http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_pottery.htm
at the bottom in the "special quest recipes" section for details on that.
you can sneak behind the npc to get the 'special jar', so no faction work
should be required for a vah shir (again, unless they start out KoS).  it
ports you to the entrance of kaladim, about a 2 minute run from the PoK book
in GD.
