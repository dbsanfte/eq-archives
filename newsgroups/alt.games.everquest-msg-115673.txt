Orc toes! We don't need no stinking Orc toes!!! I'll tell ya, I killed every
type of Orc from High Pass to South Ro looking for those toes and haven't
found them yet... Thought I was close with the DeathFist Leggos in Nek.
dropping every other body part, but no toes... I did try the feet thinking
maybe that's what he wanted, but he gave me the headband and one foot back
and told asked me what he was supposed to do with these items... If someone
finds these toes, please let me know...
