    Strands rotted because you folks have farmed the living bejeezus out of
Dain, /bonk! The Codex is about the weakest item he drops, and even that I
can see going offhand on someone without a NToV shield. And people without
NToV gear can kill the Burrower.

> The stained robes is a piece of crap

    If it has FT, it's nae crap. I don't like it because it has no HPs or
+MANA, but it has fair resists, good stats otherwise, and FT. The high elf
in my guild that has one is happy with it.

    Psst, he has six drops. ;-)

    Velk isn't the sort of mob you knock over with two groups of pre-NToV
people, though, is he? The fact that there's even two items on the Burrower
that your guild would consider worthwhile should tell you how good his stuff
is.
