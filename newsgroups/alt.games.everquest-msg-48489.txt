A friend of mine who has played in several game's betas, but not EQ's,
told me that in most, they do something special on the last day or
two, just for fun.  For example, in the Asheron's Call beta (I think
that was the one), the GMs came and boosted everyone up in level and
gave them good items and stuff, so they could go try out really tough
things.

In Dark Age of Camelot (which I was in), they brought up a server
where the XP from mobs and quests was multiplied by 10, and the money
dropped by mobs that drop coin was also multiplied by 10.  (This works
out OK, because skills in DAoC are either based directly on level, or
are based on how you spend training points you earn by leveling, so
when you zoomed up at 10x speed, your skills weren't left behind).
This was extremely fun.  You could pick a class, and 30 minutes later
be high enough level to have the basic spells and skills in all the
areas that class specializes in, and get a good idea of what it is
like.  This was great for checking out things.

I know there are people in this group who played in the EQ beta.  Do
you recall what, if anything, they did special at the end of beta for
fun?
