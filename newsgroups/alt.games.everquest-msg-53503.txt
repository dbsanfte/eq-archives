Ah, now see that's what I would have suspected. But I wasn't sure if the
fact that they were swinging some non-magical rusty weapon would affect
that or not. Plus, the information on eqclasses.necro was a bit vague on
it. They list the level *12* pet as getting something called "magical
attacks" as a special thing for the higher level summoned ones.

Of course, the xp loss at level 8 or nine isn't much and it's just a
couple of bone chips, but I'd hate to attack my first wisp with my shiny
new pet and find out that I was going to be soloing it. Heh.
