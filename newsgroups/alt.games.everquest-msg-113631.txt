I would like to get an OT gate hammer, but of course everyone hates Iksar so
I'm KoS at the Venril Sathir-faction OT outpost.  The quest does require you
to be at amiable faction as I tried doing the turn-in while sneaking but the
foreman told me he wouldn't work with me, so I have a few questions on
raising the faction.

--About how many sarnak war braids will I need to turn in to become either
non-KoS or amiable?  My VS faction is still at default.
--Are there any quests other than the braid quest that can be done to raise
VS faction?
--Will wolf form raise the faction at all?  Probably not, but maybe they
hate wolf form less than Iksar.  Also, I fully realize that wolf form makes
you KoS in FV, but does anyone know for sure what it does at the OT outpost
with an evil deity?  The "evil deity" part is key because of course your
Tunare-worshipping druid is going to be KoS there in wolf form, but religion
seems rather important to VS faction (like all agnostics are not KoS by
default) so the effect could be completely different worshipping
Cazic-Thule.  Again, this is all speculation on my part and I know it's
likely that wolf form makes you auto-KoS regardless of any other factor.
--Allakhazam's lists some Kunark dragons that raise the faction e.g.
Gorenaire.  Will killing any Kunark dragon raise VS faction or just certain
ones?  How much of a faction increase do you get from killing them?  Are
there any other mobs that raise VS faction?

Advice from anyone with personal experience as an Iksar trying to raise VS
faction would be highly valued.  Thanks in advance.
