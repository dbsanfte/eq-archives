Thank you! That makes sense in a way that somehow didn't previously
penetrate. I'll continue my research as I have more questions. As a Shaman,
I've seen the list of Imbue spells available to me (appears that I can only
use Imbue Ivory as I am a follower of The Tribunal), but I've not yet scoped
out the enchantment side of things. I take it Enchanters get spells similar
to my Imbue spells and that these are cast on ingredients to the combine (I
would imagine ore or sheets).

Aye, it appears that Barbarians do not have access to any enchanted armors.
Odd, and disappointing.
