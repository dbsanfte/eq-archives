No, more like Customer service can only go so far on some things.  Same
with technical support.  It isn't a matter of not caring, but when you have
a subscriber base of 400k, and over 50 to 60 people hammering people all at
once about their problems...  I mean, look in Gen Chat.  The GM there is no
tech, yet he gets hammered with Tech Support questions, even when they
repeatedly state they don't know.  When something goes down...  You know
the first thing that comes out of a person's mouth?  "Is the server down?"
despite the fact there is a banner on the top stating the very answer.
When the servers first come up, the usual first complaint will be, "WTF?
It took me (insert time period) to get on, and I can't get onto the server,
WTF is up with that?"  Despite the fact that the banner states that the
login servers are overwhelmed at the time.

This is true..  The game worked greate before DX8.1.  It was smoother,
faster on my new system than Luclin in some areas.  In fact, it still is,
in some cases.  Thing is, they went to this new interface to entice people
to play, since some people didn't like the graphics.  If you look at Medal
of Honor: Allied Assault, it is a wonderful game, but has gotten some
criticism about how cheesy it looks.  Same with C&C Renegade.  The graphics
isn't great, but its MP is fun at times.  There are some out there who
prefer better graphics, and unfortunately, it means using a new engine.

Problem is...  They can't respond to everything.  Absor himself can say he
is the god of all creation, but he has to backup the claim.  There is only
so much he can say.  Does it mean they don't care?  No.  Problem is, not
everything is as an easy fix and it isn't ignoring their userbase, but you
also have to understand that they may have people who work on different
aspects.  Not all programmers are going to be savvy on making the graphic
information pass correctly to the graphics interpreter, versus a person who
does modelling, or a person who designs the NPC reactions to spell effect
coding.  Remember, programmers are not equal and some may not have the
knowledge in other areas you expect them.

It is like expecting a car mechanic to fix a car radio.  Yes, it is part of
the car, but for him to fix the radio when he specializes in Engines, is
like asking a drummer to play the guitar.  They are both musicians, but
doesn't mean their abilities fit the instruments, nor should you expect the
'programmers' as you lump them all into one category, to fix everything in
one fell swoop.

Read above...  When you can program across the board, you can set
priorities.  If you can only program in one area...  What do you fix?  I
know programming, I know I can't do graphical interface programming, at the
very least, not even the ones they are using.  I do know that if I was
given a scripting language for the NPCs, and time with it, I might be able
to do some of the reactions properly.  However, I am not so naive to
believe that it is a priority issue foul up, to know that I can't fix the
interface, cause I know that I may not have the knowledge to do so.  It is
possible to fix other bugs and not fix major ones such as the crashing ones
because, gasp, some of the programmers might actually have knowledge on
quashing the other bugs, but not the knowledge on API interface.  While you
think it is easy, volunteer and help them out.  If you can fix it, you got
a job with them.  But if you can't, sit down, be quiet.  It is easy to say
one thing, doing it is another.
