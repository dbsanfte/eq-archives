At what levels do each of the casters get the ability to bind others,
and to bind themselves.

Also, why does druid and cleric not count as pure casters? Druid isn't
a hybrid of anything, is it? (Since Ranger is Warrior/Druid hybrid),
and Cleric isn't a hybrid (since Pallies are Cleric/Warrior hybrids).
Am I right?
