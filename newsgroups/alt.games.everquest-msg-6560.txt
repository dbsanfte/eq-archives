There's also a nifty little program called DxWindows that lets you run
DirectX applications in windowed mode. (aka, EverQuest) Available at
www.hackersquest.gomp.ch ..

Note that DxWindows doesn't violate VI's License Agreement (maybe, but
probably not) but several of the other programs on that site DO.

DxWin is currently broken though .. VI kinda goofed 'em up with the latest
patch.
