right... so for every 100 hp the mob has he has 0 of them left. still 
adds up to a big lot of nothing.

I agree with the OP, if its at 100% it should have all its hit points, 
and if its at 0% it should be dead. If it has even 1hp... its at 1% not 
0%, and if its got 2,999,999 out of 3,000,000 its at 99% not 100%. 
Unfortunately this would require special custom rounding rules to 
implement...because there is no standard rounding function that works 
like this.

As everyone has stated its just a round off artifact.So we're dealing 
with at most <1%. (Somepeople have  asserted that its <0.5% but I 
suspect SoE may use a floor function for rounding.)
Its hardly worth getting excited about, it doesn't affect the game in 
any meaninful way that I can think of.
