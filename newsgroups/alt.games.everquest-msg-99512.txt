They've been making a fortune for several generations now smuggling
vellium weapons back to the homeland. Would you give up that kind of a
racket?
;-)

But seriously, I think an "in-story" perspective on it could be this:
They may have wanted to go home initially, but that was many, many
generations ago. The dwarves there today are in the home that they grew
up in, have built a huge empire (even if they are perpetually at war
with the giants) and would have no reason to give up all they have
worked so hard to build.

Third choice.... dorfs aint' that smart anyway, so even with all the
folks running around and the portals and such, they probably still don't
realize they're not stuck there anymore.
