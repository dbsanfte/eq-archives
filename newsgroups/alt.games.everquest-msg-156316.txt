Funny...my wife turned into one of them a few years back.  Her hotmail
account is *loaded* with porn and wants to know how to get rid of it...no
she's not actively looking for that stuff (believe me...) and I explained to
her that it's because she signs up for *every* stupid mailing list, free
offer, and contest she finds.
"But I only sign up for things on Christian sites!!!", she says.
Turns out no matter what holy-rollers run these sites, they are more than
willing to make money by selling addys to whoever is willing to pay for
them.
Imagine that.
Surprised?

Not surprised,
SEAN...

p.s. Great story Rastus.  AOL is like a modern-day hex to cast upon others.
