MGB?  Wow you are a generous soul, I always put MGB way down on my "well I'll
get around to that sometime" list.  After all, so many others have it, and it
generally only takes one person with it to take care of the raid (that being
the point and all).  I mean, sure, if I was one AA away from it, but like you
with Canni V, I'd have to do something in order to do something in order to
do something in order to be able to spend AA on MGB.

Canni V, on the other hand, from everything I hear, is the Holy Grail of
shaman mana regen, seems to me it would be on the Must Have list like a
ranger going for EQ, no brainer.

Its cannidancing where the mount is handiest.  After all, you aren't moving
(can't move while casting anyway) and are probably moving slower than even
the worst mount (cause Stoicism/Torpor won't let you run at SOW speed like it
or not).  You can dance, of course, but that means you have to spend part of
each med cycle on your butt, possibly incurring aggro you don't want, and
almost certainly slowing down the rate at which you could canni if you didn't
have to worry about the dance (I figure it at about 20% fewer canni per
minute)

Heh, I thought you were going to tell me you were 6Kpp short on purchasing a
Fungi or something.  One spell, versus a pony?  Well, I can tell you aren't a
young (62) cleric desperate to pass Trials (which is what finally forced me
to buy my first mount)
