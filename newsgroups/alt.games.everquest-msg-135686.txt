Well... In the sense of not playing him much, I guess so. In fact, I 
haven't so much as logged into EQ in the last two months or so... Low 
fifties is not a happy time for a soloing Druid. And on top of that, I'm 
amazed at how much extra time I have for myself now that I don't have a 
gaming PC. Hell, in fact, these days I'm even answering my mail. :)

On the other hand, I'm keeping my account open (the latest payment for a 
six-month period just went through), and I'll try to get in as a beta 
tester of the Mac version, and at any rate, the Mac port should come out 
next spring.

Still, I'm keeping one PC as an Internet slave (MacOSX drivers for the 
Alcatel ADSL modem are shite), and it can just about run EQ in a pinch, 
so I will perhaps just park Han in the bazaar and leave him there, 
picking out bargains.

Anyway, for the longest time now, this newsgroup has been giving me 
ninety percent of my EQ-related enjoyment (many days I spend more time 
reading and posting than playing), so you aren't getting rid of me that 
easily.  :)
