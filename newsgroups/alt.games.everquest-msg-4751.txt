Folks keep thinking that the children of "FANG" *snicker* are somehow
hurting this newsgroup.

They aren't.

The regulars...the people here helping folks interested in EQ are not going
anywhere.  When people come here they can expect good answers from both the
regulars and folks who just stop by on occasion.  Hell, I've gotten MANY of
my own questions answered in email and I'm sure that'll continue for others
as well.

I think some folks are overreacting.  In fact, I think that anyone who
starts a thread like this is overreacting. :)

If you use OE5, highlight a message title of a child and hit Alt-M, S, then
hit Enter.  Problem solved!
