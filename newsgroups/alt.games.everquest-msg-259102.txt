The other thing you would have to investigate is whether there is any
problems with the 4 x board (probably not) but my suggestion would be
to go with the 9800 Pro and in your next upgrade look at PCI Express
the new graphics option which will be with us, mainstream, very
shortly.  Then move to the flash new Nvidia or Radeon cards with that
format.

In other words for your board would probably go with the 9800 Pro for
the time being and change when you upgrade your mobo o)
