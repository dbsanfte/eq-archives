How it came to pass that some people use the phrase "doing a T" on drinal to
express, someone messed up a quest royaly:

We raced through a druid epic within a week because this guy had a nag at
getting people motivated for help. This hapened way back when NPCs wouldnt
hand wrongly traded items back to you. Well we finally killed Faydadar, the
feared gigantic water dragon . :p
The drood loots and went off to do his last handins. And what did he do?
/sigh He hands his final part to the bloody wrong treant!!!! Blamm! Ty for
trying, better luck next time. Please restart your epic.
The drood (u might have guessed his name is T) starts to curse, flame and
rant in guildchat and obviously also to the GM that got involved. He didnt
get anything back and left the guild because some people couldnt hold back
and snickered a bit and some were pissed cause he ranted at them for his
stupid mistake.
Since then messing up a quest is paraphrased as "doing a T" )

Btw i didnt used the real name of the druid. T stands for his name.
