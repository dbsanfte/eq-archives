That's what I'd expect.  The problem they are trying to address is the
relatively fixed patch times.  Since the patches end at pretty much
the same time most of the time, there is a strong advantage to being
in certain time zones when it comes to getting some mobs.

It's especially annoying for mobs on long timers, such as Vox and
Naggy.  On my server, for a long time, there was one guild that got
every Vox and Naggy, because they were the only high enough level
guild on when the servers would come up.

By randomizing the first pop, that will give others a chance to get
them first after a patch, solving the time zone problem.

Keeping them spawning like clockwork *after* that would be good,
because it will allow people to plan for them, once the first kill
after a patch happens.
