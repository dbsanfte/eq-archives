It's a side issue, but why that choice?   I'd make the obvious
assumption you have JBoots for your non-SoW toons.  SoW
and JBoots don't stack with the running speed ability, IIRC,
so you're only doing this for hunting inside.  Even naked, I
wouldn't expect you'd be traveling w/o SoW, either natively,
by a fellow guildie, or via potion.

It would *seem* that the resist buffs would be a lot more
likely choice, along with buffs to either the melee or caster
useable stats.  Then you get into the ability characteristics,
where even those are going to be more useful than some
ability to increase your running speed indoors.

At any rate, I can see spending quite a few points maxing out
stats - INT/WIS, STR, AGI, DEX, etc - as well as the resists (if
not in the reverse order, most likely) as well as getting the
useful abilities long before I'd think about running speed.  So,
why that choice?   Even with that maxxed, you're not going to
be kiting ToVN mobs...   Well, I wouldn't think so, anyway. ;)
