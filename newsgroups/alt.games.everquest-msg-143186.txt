Which specific mobs and AoE's would this apply to, so I can be ready? I
know that it doesn't apply to Talendor (the most recent dragon we took
down) as I got dispelled in random slots there. Only spent one session
in ToV thus far, and didnt' really notice then. Aside from chromodracs,
I'm trying to think what other dispelling mobs I run into regularly, but
I'm drawing a blank.
