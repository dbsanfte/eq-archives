    They do this on purpose. Part of it is initially misjudging distance for
sit aggro, part of it is a fear that if the pull catches up to them they'll
die, part of it is the joy of training someone without it being
petitionable. None of it is justified. As a cleric, I simply heal myself up
first before the puller if I'm trained like that - once the puller sees
where the first heal will go, they stop (remember that fear of death thing?)
If you aren't the healer, well, you can med without the book now - just get
out of the way!

> and an add aggros on you?

    I tank it. I'm a plate class, I should act like one. If it's a
sufficiently nasty mob, I'll start to self-heal to stay alive while casually
mentioning to the group that I'm self-healing to stay alive. Again, it's
amazing how motivated a group can become when they realize the cleric won't
be healing them until they get on the ball. If I were less sarcastic, I'd
use Stun to pause the attacks and Root to park the add. But who learns when
you do that?

    Amazingly enough, that's what a group expects an enchanter to do with an
add.

    Stun to give yourself time, back up as your spell gems are refreshing.
Only difference is now you have a single target stun, not an AoE version.
Try using Stun first - not only is it less mana, faster casting, and less
resisted, but it also won't break a mez if the enchanter lands a mez before
you land your stun.

    *cringe* I have a personal dislike of hotkeys like that. They suggest
that a cleric is incapable of standing and tanking while channeling heals
through, which usually isn't the case. They also make the tacit assumption
that the people on crowd control in the group are such airheads that they
don't notice where mobs are going and what they're doing. Time to look for
new crowd control if you need a hotkey like this. If you have to have this
hotkey, at least make it a multi-line macro with a /y somewhere in it. The
yell will tell folks exactly where you are in case things really are hectic,
so no time will be wasted looking for you.

    This is a very bad habit. If you start running around, and the mob
starts running after you, it'll be harder for a tank to taunt it off of you
because they need to hit the mob to taunt and they can't hit something out
of range. I know that you're just running from unengaged mobs, but once you
start getting into the habit of running from aggro it'll be hard to stop.
Wait for a tank to engage the mob or crowd control person to deal with it.
If a tank engages, either wait for the mob to turn away from you before
moving or slowly back away once it's been engaged. No running around like an
INT caster, it's embarassing! :-)

> At what point do you start healing in a fight?

    When someone needs a heal to avoid death, when someone needs a heal to
avoid frenzy leading to death, when someone will need healing in the future
and you're not sure you'll be able to heal them. The first one is pretty
easy to understand - enchanter is at two or three bubs and getting pounded,
you heal them at a time such that they aren't dead before the heal lands.
Second one is looking a bit into the future - if someone gets below about
30% health, other mobs nearby and the original mob will stop hitting others
and start pounding on that person until they die. So sometimes you heal to
keep folks from getting all the attention at 30%, because you might not be
able to keep them alive if that happens. The third is the most
future-looking of all, and involves a lot of judgement. Puller takes a fair
chunk of damage pulling? Make sure to "top up" their health before they
pull, usually by timing a heal to hit them just before they head out. Two
tanks are dropping health at the same rate at the same time? Might want to
put a fast heal on one of them early, so you don't get two people needing
heals at once. That last one is really a big issue when you have Complete
Heal, which takes ten seconds to cast.

    I also heal to grief warriors. Ask Jazz about that. :-)

    Until someone has played a given class, or played alongside that class
for some time, they have a poor idea of the specifics of what that class can
do. If a wizard told me they were at 30%, I'd have no idea how much damage
they could put out and still hold mana for an evac unless they told me.
Telling a caster when to cast, any caster, is silly - they know better than
you do, odds are. I have yet to tell a cleric in a group with one of my
non-clerics to heal me, so I'm doing OK in this department. :-)
