I was playing a monk and bard until last October when I started getting a
bit bored.  I tried a rogue and have barely touched the others since.

I am a master of agro management.  By the end of a fight, I (yes, I) should
have seen to it that the tank took most of the damage.  If not, it should
have been me taking instead of any of the casters.  I can pretty much decide
who gets hit and when IF I am doing my job right (and if everyone else is
doing their job (and not overnuking)).

I am a master of reconaissance.  My sneak and hide is far superior to both
Invis and IVU combined.  It never drops unexpectedly and I *always* know
when I've succeeded.  I am only vulnerable to mobs which SeeInvis and even
then Sneak, when properly used, can get me past some of those.  I recently
snuck through the lair of the arch-lich Miragul in EF, and to the depths of
Castle MM, under the belly of a great dragon (by accident!), through SkyFire
and deep into LGuk.  There is nothing like the thrill of being surrounded by
ready-to-agro reds and strolling right past them.

I am a master of damage.  When properly taunted (thank you, tanks) I can
dish out phenomenal damage.  My backstabs do approximately 30% of my damage
and is pretty much on top of all normal hits I do.  When I get into the 50s,
my disciplines will add even more damage, including *double* backstabs.  At
60th, I will get the chance (just like with a War's Crits) of doing an
ASSASSINATION of 32000 damage.  There's nothing like watching that
highlighted "..crits for 50 damage!" when you've just subtly slid in a blade
doing 200+.

I can be a better puller than a FDing monk.  With proper application of
Sneak while pulling, you can separate a camp without ever pulling them all
in the first place.  (This one I've still got to learn, but it's
awe-inspiring to see it done).


ON THE OTHER HAND,

I am easily THE most group dependant class.  I can rarely solo a blue
(though I've found a couple that I go back to when I want to up my defensive
skills), and I have *never ever* soloed an even, yellow, or red.  I have low
HP and, normally, mediocre AC.  I can dish it out, but I can't take it.
(That's class balance.)

I am almost entirely equipment dependant.  I'm as good as dead if I'm
ambushed on a corpse run.  You can't backstab if it's facing you, and you
can't stab at all without a weapon.

We are inundated with players who want to play rouges (not rogues) and never
bother to learn their skills (like that 34th Rouge the other fellow mentions
never learning to evade).
We attract losers who think that playing a rogue entitles them to rob their
groups blind, so the 'honest' rogues suffer as a result.
I can't spend 5 minutes in EC without some green rouge in better equipment
trying to compare what I've worked to get (I now go in disguise into EC with
torch and doll).


The rogue class when well played can be extremely exhilarating and fun.
There's a lot more to it than 'get behind and poke'.
