There was a lot of swapping and cache draw with 512M ram. That's why I
upgraded to 1G Monday. Undisfortunately, I've got to RMA the RAM. It died at

Thanks. as mentioned in another response, I'm looking at a Seagate 80G SATA.
To replace the WD 40meg and 30meg currently on-system.

Sounds good to me. With your comments and those of the other responces, I've
decided to go with the 80G drive and a really nice Radeon.

Thanks heaps guys!
