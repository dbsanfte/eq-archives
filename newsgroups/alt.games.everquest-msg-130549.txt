Hmmmm...if these guys are on the docks, what do KOS people do?  With the
boats, for example, we just hop off before they get to the Butcherblock dock
and swim to shore away from hostile NPCs.  To get one, we swim out to where
the boat will go as it pulls out of the dock and get scooped up.

If we have to arrive and leave from the dock itself now, that will be
annoying.
