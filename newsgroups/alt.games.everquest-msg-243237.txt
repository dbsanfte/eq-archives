I think you are massively overestimating the costs.  Was EQ profitable at
200k subscribers?  If so, it should be much more so at 430k, since some
costs (live team salaries, for instance) will be growing slower than a
linear function of subscriber base, and nothing should be growing faster
than a linear function of subscriber base (e.g., bandwidth at worst is
linear).
