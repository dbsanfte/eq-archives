Here's what the patch message said:

"Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.
This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists
and clean up your pet. "

1) The thing is, I'm sure I did group intra-zone group teleport since
then...I can't remember the zone though but I'm thinking Lava or SRo.
2) I've also group ported folks in DL to Wakening Lands and Cobalt
Scar...two zones where I don't have the key and neither time did I do any
reloading.
3) I've GATED and self-teleported myself intra-zone.

I don't remember if any of these were "evac" spells, but I think they're
probably "evac-type" spells...at least 1 & 2 should be.
