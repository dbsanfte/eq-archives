I have a radeon 9600, driver version 6.14.10.6404 and so far I havnt had a
problem targetting people on mounts. if you continue to get people saying
they cant target you ask them if they have horse models on, *and* whatever
race models you are.

I sincerely doubt there is anything wrong with the ATI cards, if you played
more games than just everquest it would be obvious to you as well.

Whats more likely is sony released product that shoulda stayed in beta for
quite some time longer to work out all the bugs, but they have a history of
moving bugged stuff to live servers so we all must deal with it.
