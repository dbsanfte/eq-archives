I don't know the details but after 80 wins and some stuff I've read, it
appears to be that points awarded are scaled to both your level AND the
average level of the group.

A LDoN group's average level determines the level of adventure it gets
(meaning the level of mobs in the adventure). However the adventures are
scaled in steps 5 levels apart. Something like: a group of players that
averages out to level 47 will get a level 40 dungeon, while a group that
averages out at 48 will get a level 45 dungeon. This is why a small change
in group lineup can make a distinct difference in difficulty of the
adventure -- and in how much experience you're earning. As a level 60 or 61
player in an adventure group that includes at least three 65s, some mobs are
white to me; if I'm one of the highest level players in a group then all
mobs are db to me and appear to be low-db at that.

The same appears true for the adv points awarded, and the differences in
points increase as you level up. In a group with several 65s, I have been
awarded as much as 44 points which is _less_ than anyone else in the group;
doing the exact same dungeon with me as the highest level player, I get
about 31 points which is _more_ than anyone else. By some quirk of this
system's arithmetic, I have never been awarded exactly 23, 24, 25, 26, or 27
points: as I levelled up through the mid/high 50s I went abruptly from
getting 22 points for a win to getting 28 points.

I decided early on not to let this sort of stuff affect my LDoN adventuring
choices, though. Life's too short and there are few things as frustrating as
an hour wasted trying to get a LDoN group together while players fuss over
the exact level range of the lineup, which camp to do, etc. The expansion
offers enough different rewards (points, exp, plat, augs+items) that it
works out fine if you just dive in and let the payoffs arrive however they
shake out.
