Thanks for the info.  Hmm, that really doesn't make it all that useful,
though... 50 points at level 200... which isn't much against a level 39
warrior or pally.  1k HP per stack.... I guess that isn't too bad, though.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
