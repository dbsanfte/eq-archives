so far having played to 18 with my druid and coming to terms with the fact
that I am bad at melee I have had little trouble getting into groups I think
mainly for the sow ability but also when camping big camp for the harmony.
I have yet to play the higher lvls though but am happy at times to solo its
just the running or waiting about while people tell you "can you spare a
sow?" sometimes get you a bit peeved but I do try to help anyone that I can
you never know when you need to return the favour.

One problem I came upon last night was the distance attacking can cause you
to lose kills to others, Last night I rooted a croc and was about to start
zapping him from afar when this warrior came up and started killing him I
said "that's mine" and was ignored so after he had finished I sent him a
tell to plz stop stealing kills and got a mouthful of abuse so he is now on
ignore and guaranteed never to get a sow from me :0)
