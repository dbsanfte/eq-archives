Many things summon, so you're probably better off elsewhere for kiting.

Dire charm is an AA, but there's no great need for it.  It has not been a
powerful ability for a long time, since it only works for level 46 or below
mobs.

Yes they do, and yes it does.  Wait, strike that.  Reverse it.

It never breaks early on it's own.  It expires after MANY hours, and it can be
dispelled.  And if you go invisible or zone, it breaks.

I'm not sure what's best for druids as far as AA progression, but I know
that DC is pretty low value.  There's no real reason to get it EVER, unless it
would be a fun toy for you when you have dozens of spare points you don't
know what to do with.

Even for enchanters, who are not limited to animals (but are still limited to
trash mobs below level 47), this is not an A-list or even B-list ability.
