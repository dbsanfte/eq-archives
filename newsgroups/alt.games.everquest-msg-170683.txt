So anyway earlier tonight i was on my way to seb  to  finihs off lvl 52,
and on the way ther eim thinking man,  you should hold out a week or two and
catch a naggy or vox raid one more time before ya lvl. So anyway im almost
to Seb and a bard /tells me Hey wanna  go to a vox raid?

        bein skepticle(sp) at first  after giving him the 3rd degree, i
decided i would do it, jus b/c  i was thinking  now 5mins before that about
how i should  kill her once more before i lvl'd too high. so i went,  and
things werent goin very good  while clearing no one was listening, i thought
it was gunna be a wipe out for sure,  so we pull vox,  im  frantically
standing next to her ass  casting stun whenever i see her begin to cast,  to
interupt the CHeals.
 and  toward the end  between stuns i was nuking,   i got the  final blow on
her  for 263points of dmg :)   then, on top of that i rolled a perfect 1000
out of 1000  on the white dragon hide :)


 all in all i had an excellent night! =)
