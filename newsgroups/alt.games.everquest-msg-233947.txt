Lately I've had some bugginess on the pull.  I'll start to sing the pull
song, turn and run, and as soon as the song lands the mob is somehow beating
on my back.  This happened several times in guk, and a few times in Mir.  I
think it is related to z axis changes, but it does not always happen pulling
downhill.  Anyone know what is going on there?  I can handle a little
beating on normal, but think they would probably snuff me if it was a hard.
