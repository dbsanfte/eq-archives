It would help if you quoted at least a little of the post you are

Interesting strategy. Try when the dragoons are out, and swim around the 
wall, you'll be able to come up by the dock, and talk to the 
translocator. No chance of getting jumped by a mob you can't see.

That said, if you are concerned just invis through butcherblock. Nothing 
sees invis on that side, at least along the route to the apprpriate dock 
that I've ever seen.
