From the shadows, the mysterious "Paul Botts"
<paulbotts@sbcglobalspam.net> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

Your best bet, believe it or not, might be to stay in nektulos.
There's no safe zone for you at that level, you won't want to be in
any close quarters place like a dungeon (unless you have some friends
you *trust*), and nek is dark and misty enough to avoid most the
trouble - and there is no tracking class available to dark elves.

However there's no guaranteed safespot. No matter what you do you may
get smoked; nay, its *likely* you will.
