You snip out integral part of my point and tell *me* to keep up? A guild, 
provided they are even qualified to *be* in these tier 2 planes, should 
be able to get a couple people flagged per week *without* requiring any 
one person to spend all their time working on getting others flagged. Who 
said it all has to happen right away?

One person gets flagged. They spent 40% of their time trying to help get 
others through. The other 60% of their time can be spent levelling 
wherever they want. That levelling will even make them *more* effective 
in helping others get flagged. Again, *less than half* of their time 
should be required here, imho.

Already have. Of course a guild splitting is a bad thing. Duh. The split 
is just not necessarily necessary or the fault of the trials.

I don't know, you seem to remain entertained by it.

Again, not having witnessed it first hand does not prevent an 
understanding. Do you still think the moon is made of cheese? Do you 
still think the earth revolves around the sun? I feel it safe to say you 
are not an astronaut.

You keep falling back on your claim that my views are uninformed when in 
fact they are not. I am informed, just not by actual experience.

Well, it's the fact that you think I'm a jackass that makes you 
unreceptive to anything I have to say at this point, so why do you 
bother?

Why don't you just go back to your fake friends and keep wondering why 
the hell they won't spend a little time helping each other out. Better 
yet, fall short in supporting each other and then blame it all on SoE. 
That's *much* easier than doing what and decent person should in the 
first place - going the extra mile where it's needed. Whatever gets you 
throught the night.
