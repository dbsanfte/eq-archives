Greetings,
My current system is a PIII 667mhz, with 256mb PC133 RAM, GeForce2mx
graphics card with the latest drivers and 64mb RAM.  I'm also running
this on DX8.1 with Windows 98.  I recently bought this card so I can
eventually play shadows of luclin.  I will eventually upgrade to 512mb
RAM.  A few days ago I was running on 96mb of RAM using a Voodoo3 with
the latest drivers from everquest's website.

I installed my new GeForce2 card with the manufacturers drivers.  It's
an Extacy(sp?) card.  I opened Everquest and started to play the game.
 Everything was great, except when I run through Greater Faydark the
trees in the distance aren't appearing as smoothe as they used to be. 
I'll be running toward Kelethin from Crushbone and it just looks like
the city isn't being "painted" properly for lack of a better term.  As
I'm running toward the orc lift, it seems like half the tree appears
for a brief second and then everything eventually comes into view as
I'm approaching Kelethin.  I have tried to adjust the clip plane but
this really didn't change too much.

Now, I install the new drivers from Nvidia as recommended on the
official everquest web site.  I load the game and now it's running
extremely slow.  I don't have the clip plane problem, but it's running
as if there are 10,000 people in greater faydark alone.

I don't think it's a problem with a lack of hardware, cause the game
was running very well with only 96mb of RAM and a Voodoo3 card with
16mb RAM.  I was running the game this way up until yesterday, so I
was playing with this configuration after the shadows of luclin game
was released.  I do not have the social animations enabled and I have
mip mapping turned off.  I'm running the game at 800x600.

Can anyone please give me ideas as to what I can do to correct either
problem?  I can't think of any more system information I can give.  I
am running on a cable modem.  Thank you.
