Dont worry about it. My monk was a non twink who only used fists. I got my
first fighting baton at level 33 with no 1hb skill. My skill was maxxed in
only a few levels. Skills go up quickly that u have neglected if u use them
all the time. Use whatever you can to get it started as suggested a cracked
staff or even a splintering club, spend about 1 bub per level fighting with
it just to work on skills.  Practice both 1hb and h2h, and 2hb too if u can.
2hb weapons do far more dmg post 50 anyway.
