Do both captains accept both types of scalp?  I thought each of
them only wanted the scalps from the type of mob (orc or gnoll)
found at that end of the pass.

Your other suggest, helping newbies in Crushbone in order to get
the faction adjustments for their kills, is excellent.  I did
that recently in Blackburrow with my monk to raise my faction with
the Qeynos monk guild.  I was all alone, slaughtering everything in
sight, until a level 8 monk showed up.  So then I "power-levelled"
him, using things like "throw stone" to tag mobs for him and let
them try to hit me until he was ready to take them off me, or just
bandaging him while he fought.  (If I was careful, I could whack a
mob just once to make it start running away, and yet leave it with
enough hp that he could run behind it and kill it and get the xp.)
And of course if he got an overpull I could help him recover.

Using a 30-something monk to PL someone was definitely a different
experience for me!
