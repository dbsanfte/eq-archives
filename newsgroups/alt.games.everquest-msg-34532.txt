Does it?  I guess I've never been put on ignore.  I thought this
was an entirely passive action, didn't know the ignored person'
got a warning about it.

Its not something I"ve done often, but I do have an ignore
list, and if you are on it, I won't ever group with, res, heal,
buff, or otherwise help you in any way.

I don't have any recollection of why any of those people
are on  the list, you see.  Spammers?  Rip me off in a trade?
Beggers?  Dunno, don't care.  I'll assume, for the sake
of arguement, that I put them there because they put
aviak droppings in my beer mug...
