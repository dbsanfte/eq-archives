    Our guild has been having a boatload of fun killing stuff. After the
main patch we nabbed Glyphed, Exiled, wiped to Cursed, got King Tormax,
Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Va'Dyn, the Ring of Slime, and a quest NPC for
someone. Yesterday we got Glyphed, Exiled, Cursed, Creator, and were just
heading to Ring of Slime when my cough forced me to go to bed early. I think
the only guild having more fun than us is the guild that got NToV for last
patch, as they've been able to claim "it didn't fully pop" and got those
first two days free. For guilds that have been cooped up in Ssra farming
keys and ore for the past few weeks, this "lewt rampage" has been VERY
welcome.
