I have a geforce 4 mmx and eq crashes, and my other ps used to have that
problem till i upped the voltage a fraction in the bios; but on this pc, i
don't have the option. It's an amd 1.4 gig processor; does anyone know of a
better motherboard for this purpose?

I contacted verant but all i got was the usual; reinstall everything , use
latest drivers, blah blah blah... done all that before talking to them.

I'm curious tho; i play morrowind on the pc that is now stable, and was
doing so before increasing the voltage a notch, and played other 3d games,
and it was only eq that crashed. Was the increased stability just a
coincidence or what? Would it really help this pc stay working?

I hate crashes. Went 'linkdead' in skyfire over and over the other day
(connection fine, i 2 box) and it was scary to think my avatar might decide
to go swimming in lava or something. I had it happen when i was in greater
wolf form just next to the nexus scion, and my body was found halfway across
the zone; apparently it decided to go walkies when i wasn't in control.
