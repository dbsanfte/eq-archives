Those are reasons it would be good... and DT was saying it was something 
he would have loved, so I'm thinking he was looking at those reasons.

However, -if- flame lick (et al, but Flame Lick is the one most people 
are likely to really care about) now uses them as expendables instead of 
as a catalyst, then this would be a major down side to the change

Not that I think its likely, I was just tweaking DT on his little joke.
