My enchanter went with alteration, and I haven't regretted it much.  Sure, 
I would have survived those long mez sessions a few more times with 
conjuration, but in a DPS LDoN group I use haste and slow, and charm when 
possible.  In the low 60s slow is 255 mana, and charm takes 400 to 500, so 
I'm very glad to have the cost reduced a bit.
