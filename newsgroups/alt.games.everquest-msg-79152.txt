Having a tradeskill book in your inventory or open while combining
items increases your chance to make the item. (False)

Harmony spell increases mana regeneration. (False)

Holding a mana vial increases mana regeneration. (False)

Getting low on stamina slows or has detrimental effect on weapon
swings/attacks. (True, only for stamina below 100, false otherwise)

How you kill a creature has an effect on what items drop from it.
Like using blunt weapons to kill an animal will allow for higher pelt quality.
(False. All items on  a mob are determined at spawn not at death
and don't change unless its from the trivial loot code.)

Pyzjn in Qeynos hills spawns only at night. (False)

Killing bixies in the commons will spawn Griffons. (Mostly false, killing any
wandering mob causes a spot to open where a Griffon MAY spawn if they
are on the same spawn table.)
