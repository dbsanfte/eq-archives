I just saw the movie with all your comments in mind, and tried
not to think about EQ as I thought of it like
"Now I have to find my own eq-comment for it, but it mustn't be
forced"...

Well - that way I didn't really think of any eq things, except when
they are in Balins tomb, and the cave troll comes in, and
Legolas shoots him an arrow right in the face, I couldn't help
myself but to think - getting the aggro off him will be
VERY tough now....

OT:
Other than that, I must say that in the german dubbed version,
some intonations were really stupid, plus, talking about the
movie - I was rather dissapointed.

Being a big Tolkien/LOTR admirer, the only characters that
seemed very well realized to me, were Legolas, Elrond
and Gandalf.

Don't get me wrong: The others appearance was also very
life-like and close to the book, but their behaviour just
didn't fit.

I hated the whining of everyone _when_ they whined,
it was just too girlish (Boromir, Samwise, Frodo)
To make Arwen appear instead of Legolas on the
way to Elronds house was simply plain crap.
Plus her crying when the Nazgul where gone and
Frodo was fading was so very un-elven-like.

To top things off: No - when Gandalf raised his voise, Tolkien
never described that an earthquake would take apart the
house - Bilbo would sound/look greedy, longing, but not become
a special-effect-monster when he had to leave the ring behind.
Neither were special effects needed to underline Galadriels
rejection of the ring.

Oh - and LOTR was never intended to be a spiderman comic:
Elven archers dont bull-ride a troll to shoot him in the head.
Ever heard this:
"Your target is too close to use a ranged weapon..."?

Legolas was cheating outrageously.

I had taken my sister along and two of her friends,
and I told them before that I thought they would love the
film, instead later I felt like I had to excuse for it,
because to a non-LOTR-fan, it was just plain boring,
most of the time.

And to a LOTR-fan the "casual" explanations of background
story in the dialogues were completely out of place.

Just my 2p, a dissapointed

     Lars (who will of course await the other two parts anxiously
nonetheless)
