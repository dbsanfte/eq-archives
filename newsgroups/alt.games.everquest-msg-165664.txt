}Well, I can't recall offhand whether Half Elves can wear any of the
}Druid wearable robes, tho isn't that white robe from Luclin all/all?

I recently invested in about a dozen of these robes so I could experiment.  
Shainai's Nightie has no graphic on Ogres or Dwarves.  As I recall, it had 
a banded graphic on Barbarians and Vah Shir.  It looked robelike on Dark 
Elf, Gnome, High Elf, Iksar.  I think it was no graphic on Wood Elf, but 
may have been banded, can't remember offhand.  Maybe I'l make a page with 
all the screenshots I took.  Sorry, I have no human or half elf 
characters, because they suck, and no trolls because I ran out of slots. :)

}Anyhow, Druids can wear a number of different robes, so Half Elves do
}have a "natural" robe wearing class.  :-p

Druids are an unnatural class no matter how you cut it. :P
