Rant with some thought provocational value and opinion solicitation:

Taking a break from my main, I decided to work on my level 10 WE
ranger on Firiona Vie yesterday. I'm running around EC killing
anything that gives me xp (and some that don't for the tradeskill
components of course) when a human SK approaches me and ask me to
group. Now, I have to say, I have a bad habit of ignoring
opportunities to group and merely living the life of a nomadic loner,
so I figured I'd give it a shot.

We tried Befallen a couple of times. For various reasons, it resulted
in a couple of CRs for me. Then he hooked up with a friend who would
TL us to the Karanas on our way to Blackburrow, where he assured me we
would find better hunting and more people with whom to group. Again, I
though what that heck and went along. After finally making it to BB,
he appeared to run me through the place inviting anyone he came across
- at that level, what's the harm, right?

Well, aside from the fact that we ended up with four different races
in the group and no one could understand what most of the others were
saying, we seemed to be mowing down everything from greens to reds,
albeit in a very unorganized manner.

What bugged me the most was the fact that the group was just flying
all over the place, not following the typical method of camping in one
spot while someone brings mobs to us. It was total chaos. There were
multiple people pulling, people loot whoring, the term /assist was
unheard of, the list goes on. After watching the same person (my
original group mate) loot four mobs in a row, I thought I would jump
in on one and looted a +2AGI earring. Would you believe that same
person asked me if I needed it, and if not, could he have it? I gave
it to him and politely asked him if he could point me in the right
direction to get out, since I was finished for the evening. What was
his response? "You'll have to find your own way out. I don't want to
lose this group."

/sigh - Luckily, it really didn't take too much effort to find my way
out.

Roaming groups: do you like them or not? I find them to be a
clusterfudge completely lacking in any sort of skill utilization,
comraderie or dependence on one another. No fun for me at all,
although, the language barrier may have been a large factor.
