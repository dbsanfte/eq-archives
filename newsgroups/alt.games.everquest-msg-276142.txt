I wouldn't know if this is the problem, but Zonealarm acts just like
this - it "knows" EQ has changed, and thus puts up a window asking
whether to allow EQ to access the net, but it pops up "under" EQ.
This is not a problem if you run EQ in "windowed" mode, as you can see
the Zonalarm prompt and tell it to allow net access, but if you
aren't, Zonealarm will sit there forever, blocking access, so to the
viewer it looks like EQ locks up.
