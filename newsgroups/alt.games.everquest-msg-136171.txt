awww Judy, don't worry...he's just upset cause black guys by genetics have
bigger penises then junior KKK members....classic story, his girl friend
dumped him for a black guy (because they are superior to people like him)

There's a few things that I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
And everything goes to hell, anyway
-Tom Waits
