Not quite.
The sleeper script is buggy as hell--ours had Kera stuck in Skyshrine
requiring our GM to "reset" the script to get it moving again.

Some servers have reported that leaving one of the other warders up
while the fourth is killed won't wake the sleeper.  Still other
servers, the moment Ventani was killed, regardless of how many other
warders were up, Kera popped and proceeded to lay waste to everything
around him.

Besides, if you have the force assembled for Ventani, you can almost
"accidentally" kill the other three given that the other three are
such incredibly gimpy mobs.
