Subject: OT: CoH Question... Sorry for posting it here...

but aohell doesn't carry the CoH ng and even though I posted this same question
to a.g.coh through Google Groups, it may take hours for an answer.  I can only
ask that you forgive me this one time...  :)

I just phoned up the local Walmart, they have one copy of CoH and they stuck it
behind the counter for me to pick up tonight!  I'm so excited!!  Everywhere has
been sold out since the game hit the shelves...

Anyway, I'm wondering about the Free Trial period.  I'm thinking from reading
the FAQ that it is for one month, like EQ.  My confusion sets in when I read
further and it talks about having a credit card on file and so forth.

Do we have to have a credit card on file to even activate the free trial?  I
ask because we (the hubby and I) had intended to use nothing but the CoH game
cards after the free trial is over.  We used our Debit card with EQ, but when
we decided to leave the game, we apparently didn't cancel our subscriptions
fast enough so of course we were charged another 3 months each.  Yup, I know
that was entirely our fault, but knowing we are boneheads, we would rather not
give another game that same info for fear of a repeat...  LOL

Anyway, again I apologize for the CoH OT post, I know some of you get very
irritated by threads involving that game being posted here...  :(
