So let me make sure I understand this. My character is level 9. 9x1.5 is
13.5 (or an increase of 4.5). However, it's been said that there is a
minimum of a 5 level differential before xp is cut off. That means I
would be able to group with characters of up to level 14 and still get
xp (9+5=14, which is greater than 13.5). This makes sense as it is
exactly what I did last night. The highest level character was a level
14 Beastlord, but as soon as a level 15 character joined the group I
stopped getting experience. The other side of the coin is that you can
only group with characters up to 2/3 of your level and still get xp.
This means the lowest level characters I can group with would be 6,
correct? Therefore, as long as I am in a group consisting of characters
of levels 6-14 I will still get experience. However, if I were to group
with a level 5 character I would not get xp, but they would, because
their upper limit for grouping is level 10. Is this how power-leveling
works? Is there anything I'm missing here?
