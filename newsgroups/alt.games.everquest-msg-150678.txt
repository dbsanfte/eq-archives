OK, that I agree is pretty questionable.  I have a lot less trouble with the
idea of debuffing a permarooted mob.  If they just changed it so that the
permarooted mob acted more like a spell rooted mob, and attacked the closest
person, it would alleviate the issue of attacking with little to no chance
of taking damage.  I would also like to see them change it so that the mob
will summon as soon as it gets agro, or, at the very least, as soon as a
spell is cast on it.
