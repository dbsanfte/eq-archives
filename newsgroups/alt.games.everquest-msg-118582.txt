It runs great with EQ. I would say that it is a toss-up between the
8500 and the GeForce3Ti200 for best value right now. Both cards are
great performers. You cannot go wrong with either card and EQ.

>I have hear it has better visual quality , what does this mean exactly ?

Sharper image and better color saturation than a GF2 or GF3. (I don't
have a GF4 to compare it to)

>I have also head its comaparable with a 4400ti , how good is that ?

The GF4Ti4200, Ti4400, and Ti4600 are faster overall, and can do *FSAA
(Full Screen Anti-Aliasing) with a much smaller performance hit. The
8500 does FSAA with a process ATI calls "Smoothvision". You can see a
godd comparison at: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1619

*FSAA cleans up the images by removing jagged edges as well as pixel
crawling and pixel pop. If you have ever run through East Commonlands
and noticed how the grass textures shimmer as you look off into the
distance, FSAA removes the shimmer.

>Are there problems with drivers or has that all been fixed ?

The current drivers for the 8500 are great. I have no problems in any
of the games I play (EQ, IL2, Jedi Knight II, Counterstrike, etc)
