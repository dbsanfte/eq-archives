Not true.  If my pattern of refusing service showed that I was excluding 
blacks, or Latinos, or Arabs, it may take the public some time to determine 
what I was doing, but that doesn't change the point.  If I was excluding 
customers based on race, you better believe that's illegal.

How on earth do you think the American desegregation of retail 
establishments was achieved if all the shop owners, hoteliers and 
restauranteurs simply had to put away their signs and instead just tell 
every brown person who showed up to get out?
