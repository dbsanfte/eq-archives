All,

I picture one of my characters as the traditional type of rogue that
excels with traps, stealth, and killing monsters with daggers when
necessary. Not evil at all, in fact, a nice guy. I'm talking about the
professional adventuring rogue. Pretty standard stuff. However, none
of the specializations seem to fit.

Dirge and Troubador are right out, as is Ranger. Frankly, so is
Brigand. I dont picture my character as a brute / thug. Assassin might
work, but they are evil. I'm not evil, I don't even want to steal from
people really. I do want to be good with knives. That leaves
Swashbuckler. YUCK! I'm not interested in cutlasses or "Argh, matey!"
or pirate stuff. Neither am I interested in the other kind of
Swashbuckler, the kind that worries about his cologne, the proper
mustache wax, or flashing a winning smile as he duels the Count for
the hand of a lady.

So ... now what? I wish "Rogue" were a final specialization of some
type, or instead of Brigand or Swashbuckler I wish they'd had "Bandit"
and "Treasure Finder".

Any advice on which will be the closest?

Lewis
