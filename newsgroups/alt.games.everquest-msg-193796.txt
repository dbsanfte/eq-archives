Role playing is really what you make it. EQ CAN be a good roleplaying
game, but the art of roleplaying is a dying art. The biggest barrier
for roleplaying is the fact that most people dont - or dont even know
what that means. Its so hard to roleplay when everyone else doesnt. I
will say however that most people make the effort (at least to some
degree) on FV. Its nice not constantly hearing the "DING!" shouts (i
dont know about anyone else, but the DING LEVEL 2!! is the most
idiodic shout).

Yeah it is cool in this way. Me and my fiance 4 box on this server
from time to time, and its tons of fun. I could see how a player
without a consistant group of friends or an active guild would have
problems grouping here tho.

One thing the OP has to realize is the one character per account
restriction. This creates a different dynamic than on other servers.
This affects many aspects of the game, mostly positive as I see it,
but I could see that the end game would get quite crowded.

The climate of this server is quite different. Ive seen far less of
the "undesirable" types here. A much better environment than most
servers. I think most of the brats and power gamers avoid this server
due to the frustrations that these restrictions impose. Generally,
most players are curteous and respect one another.

One thing, if you are just starting out on FV is plan your quests in
advance. Because of the trivial loot code, you have to be very careful
with this. It was frustrating for us, because we worked so long and
hard on our newbie quests, we couldnt finish them because of trivial
loot code. Since they sped up the progression for newbies some time
back, you fly through the lower levels, making it impossible to finish
the quests for the armor (at least that was our experience with the
dark elf quests).
