The easiest solution of all is to not bother with the
keys, period.

If your character is able to Gate, ask out in West Commons
for any "gateable" high-level character to come help you.
All they need to do is drop down the well before you do,
wipe out the monsters there (the monsters in even the lowest
level of Befallen become trivial at higher level), then once
the room is clear, you drop down and loot your corpse.  Then
you both just Gate out.

If your character is not able to Gate, then do the same thing,
but you'll have to specifically get a high-level Druid or Wizard
to help you.  Again, they drop down, clear the room, you drop
down, loot your corpse, and then join up with the Dru/Wiz
as they teleport you and themselves back out to West Commonlands.

This is a lot easier and quicker than trying to chase down all
the keys, and then work your way through the three floors to
your corpse and then back to the exit.
