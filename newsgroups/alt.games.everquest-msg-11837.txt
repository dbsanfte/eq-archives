	Actually Rangers start with mediocre DEX, and it is not flagged as a prime
attribute.  Since it also affects Archery, it should be.  Venture started with
a 75 DEX because I didn't know any of this and it's really thrown off my grove
in later levels.  You really need to break 100 DEX to get a decent proc rate
with most weapons.

	Best thing a 30-plus Ranger can do: get a Wurmslayer.  It hits like a ton
of bricks and has next to no taunt value because of its high delay.  (Best
thing a 50-plus Ranger can do is get a Swarmcaller but they're still kind of
rare.  'Course the epics are great but that's a whole 'nother ball game.)

	Jolt works fairly well, except against mobs with high MR.  I'm only L54 so
I haven't had a chance to play with Cinder Jolt yet but I expect it to work
pretty much the same way.  There have been occasions when I have had to chain
cast Jolt a few times to escape, and very rarely a mob won't break off.  

	If you are on Snare duty (and you should be), then Jolt immediately after
you Snare.  Don't look to see if you drew agro, just do it.
