I can see your point, most people are terrified (when they think of
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis) to see them from both sides of the coin.
Every one is entitled to there opinion, everyone. I absolutely despise
the racist pig personally and his terrible atricities commited on the
Jews, but there must have some intelligence somewhere in the German
military for Hitler to get as far as he did. Whether is was him, or
his generals, I have no idea.

Just my opinion
