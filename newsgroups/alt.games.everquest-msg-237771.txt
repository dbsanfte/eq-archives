No counseling needed.  Here's what helped me see my life for the shit it is,
and the real desire to change it:
I pictured myself married or in a serious relationship, and going behind my
wife's back, teasing women online, talking about "if you and I were
married...If you and I were this...If you and I were that..."

She parlayed my sympathies into a pseudo emotional/sexual outlet, coupled
with some kind of attraction for me, she then played me as her fantasy.  I
was just lonely, horny, and trapped in a quite-addictive online game, and
yeah, I helped her do it.

I acted rudely, no doubt!  But how rude is it to manipulate men and stroke
their egos online in an attempt to gain "friendsplus", because she certainly
didn't treat me as a friend.  When I attempted to consign myself to
friendship, she didn't even know how to hold a decent conversation, or she
chose not to.  I merely wanted her to come clean.  When she didn't, I came
clean for her.

Heck, maybe I made her marriage even stronger by bringing it up to her
husband.  She wore quite a few masks when she dealt with people.  I pulled
the masks off, but I revealed myself in the process.  At least _I_ will seek
to change.
