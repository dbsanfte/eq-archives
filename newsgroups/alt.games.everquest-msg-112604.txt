  The best way to master jewelcraft is to get rich. ;)  You need to be
pretty skilled to make anything that anybody wants, and it gets real
expensive real quick.  Also, it's only a really pratical skill for
enchanters, since you need to enchant the bars of metal for the recipe to
result in anything anybody would want.

  Tailoring on the other hand is a good newbie trade skill.  The patterns
aren't that expensive and a lot of the ingredients drop off low level
creatures.  If you're not a twink, tailoring is a good way to equip yourself
with your first set of armor.  You can eventually craft raw silk if you're
an enchanter, magician, wizard, necromancer or monk, and you can craft
patchwork pretty easily if you're another class.  As someone else mentioned,
eqtraders.com is a good source for information on any tradeskill.  I
recommend that you give it a visit.
