Sheesh! Do any of you people even know what nerfed means?!?

Nerfed does NOT mean weak or wimpy or underpowered. It means you used to 
be powerful and were weakened by something Verant did. Wizards always 
sucked. SKs suck less now than they used to.

Necromancers and by far the most nerfed class, given how godly they were 
when EQ was first launched. Druids are second-most nerfed since DoTs were 
weakened to reduce kiting long ago. This is pretty unarguable, if you've 
played long enough to remember.
