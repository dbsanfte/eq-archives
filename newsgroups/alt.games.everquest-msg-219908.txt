Well, what happens is you hang out in the AGE newsgroup making
lots of "I quit" posts like any alcoholic trying to paint the
whole world with their problem, then you hang out here because
its a habit, but you aren't going back mind you, then you hang
out here because its intellectually stimulating and fun to
speculate about changes to the game.

In the mean time, you try watching television... the darn thing
is limited in terms of interaction to you changing the channel,
which you do a -lot- because there's no longer anything worth
watching on it other than the "girls on trampolines" segment of
the Man Show and about half of the Daily Show; when Lewis Black
screams out about Bill Gates wanting to give everyone the same
educational opportunities he had... but Bill dropped out of
school and everyone already has THAT opportunity!

Oh, and you start worrying about what happens if you come back,
what happens to your stuff.

A couple months later they release some new patch or something
and you log on just to see what its like.

Soon you're back on the treadmill, and slightly embarassed about
all those "I quit" posts.

Bergh

ps knowing you'll be back, they keep everything.  They -say- they
only keep it for 3 months, but in practice I've never heard of
anyone who couldn't get their characters back, not even the ones
that purposefully deleted them before quitting, not even two
years after quitting.  Think about it, its only a little bit of
storage space, and the odds of you coming back are much greater
if you can have the character you are "invested" in again.
