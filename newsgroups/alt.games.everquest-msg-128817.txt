When my shammy hit 9, I bought a stack of mead. Cast SoW on myself, drank as
much as I could with an AT of 0, and ran in circles around Halas until the
effects wore off, giggling madly.

With Tiru, my cleric, every time he hit x9, someone sent him a tell asking
for a rez of that level before he had a chance to scribe it.

This weekend, Tarre, my necro, summoned most of the corpses out of COM from
behind the locked door. While I felt bad that everyone died (including me),
gosh I felt useful. I'm not just a twitch-bitch. Giggle. I'm occassionally
useful too. Oh, and just sitting down around the pixies and have the pet
work clean up is fun too.
