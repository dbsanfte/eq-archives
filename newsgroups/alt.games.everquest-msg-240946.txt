IIRC, correct me if i'm wrong, MM can root the tank. Usually you have
bard and what not with the tank being able to hit 500MR in that group
to resist it. Isn't his DD proc also resistable by the same method?

Yaaa.... but just make sure you don't say taunt isn't THAT much agro
in this newsgroup *rolls eyes*.

BoC actually isn't that hard to get if you can get time on AoW.. he
tends to drop it quite a bit and sometimes 2 and in a super rare
instance i've seen him drop 3 BoC's. Both HG and BF can be a pain to
farm with HG being easier due to XTC being 3-day IIRC. And I'm sure if
i'm wrong  i'll be corrected and keelhauled by the newsgroup.
