Are you smoking something?
Fletching is going to factor into how fast you level?!?
I can buy 3 backpacks full of arrows and not have to worry about
hitting an arrow vendor for at least 2 or 3 levels.

You're not seriously considering making bows with this skill are
you?!?  If Bow + Arrow did any significant damage at all, it might be
worth it, but as a warrior, it's nothing more than your pulling tool.
For that, anything over about a 100 feet in range is perfectly
suitable.

Yeah, at level 18, I'm certain you've experienced more than enough to
know better...
