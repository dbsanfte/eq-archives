Would you say the same thing if regular cost was $1 a month, and this was $4?
$.01 versus $.04?

The important thing isn't that it's four times as much, it's that it's $30
more, and there are lots of people for whom 30 bucks a month doesn't matter.

These are the the people VI are targetting. It's a premium service, and they're
not planning on making everyone move to this service. In fact, they're setting
an 8000 people limit so that everyone can't move to this service even if they
could.

I agree that the web page stuff is just fluff, and the new map isn't worth $30
a month, but more DM participation might be, if they're focusing on special
events and quests that are truly interesting as opposed to ways of giving ï¿½ber
stuff to munchkins.
