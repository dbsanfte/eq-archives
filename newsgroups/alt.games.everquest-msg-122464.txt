I was in EW when that announcement came over. There was an *immediate*
outcry in /ooc and in my guild chat with everyone screaming about this.
I did not hear one single comment in favor of it.  This is, IMNSHO, one
of the most fucked up of all the moneygrubbing ideas that have been
shoved our way of late.

There is no way to implement this without selling themselves out as
lying, hypocritical, grab-all-the-cash bastards, unless a tracking
mechanism is in place. If you change your name, they damne well better
make it show up upon inspecting the person, or have the information
posted and available someplace.

I can't wait to hear the justification for this one, if they even
attempt to.
