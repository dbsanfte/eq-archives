There have been some in depth discussion on www.steelwarrior.org about how
damage is dealt.  The formula comes down to more or less 3 components: Some
base damage, damage index and a random component.

From their research: DmgDealt = BaseDmg + DmgIndex*(random 1-20)

So each mob's has some minimum and maximum amount of damage they can do.  IF
the have a weapon, then that is added to the DmgIndex.

There is a similar formula for PC's too, check it out, there are some
interesting conversations that happen there.
