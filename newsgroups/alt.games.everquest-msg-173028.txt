It's a fan group, so most of the people here are inclined to overlook
the game's faults. Or at least overlook some faults in favour of others. :-)
(There are entire threads about some faults... whisper it: monk nerf.)

I can see your point - or, at least, I can see why you might see it
this way.

I can say that it's much more fun when you come into the game already
knowing some people - it gives you a social base to make the game
more interesting, and other people to ask stuff like "what the heck
does this thing do?"

But thanks for giving it a try...
