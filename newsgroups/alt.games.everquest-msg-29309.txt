OK,
I am in agreement the you should not be able to hide on the roof of a
building and nuke an NPC  without risk,
But i think the same rules should apply to the NPC's also.
Example 1) Try Levitiating in any given zone 100+ feet in the air and still
getting aggroed on? attempt to defend yourself only to recieve "your target
is to far away"

2) Go to lake of ill omen (personal experience) at the mill, you CAN be
killed by the MOB "under the world" i think is the term the GM used, can't
see it, can't target it.

3) Pick any zone, grab yourself a staff, go find a mob, (try to hit the mob
without killing it in one shot) eventually you will get "your target is too
far away" (i am using common sense i hope) Staff is about 6ft tall,
mob(insert orc) Has 4? ft Arms? but he is still hitting you?

4) Any zone yet again, I understand when a MOB is whacking the crud outta
me, i get knocked backwards,
but why, when reversed, I STILL get knocked backwards??? he stay planted,
and even advances on me?

5) take your caster (over 20 for arguments sake) and go to Greater Faydwer,
find and orc shaman/oracle, when he aggroes see how long he can cast before
running OOM?(did this myself, i ran out of mana wayyy before he did)

The GM's and Guides i have asked about these types of thing tell me that it
prevents player Exploits so the game is FAIR(underline) but somehow It does
not seem that way, these are just a handful of examples, I am sure you
people have hundreds of your own. (my personal HATE is undercons, if it is
green, it should go down like debutant on prom night.) not kick my a**.

Thus endeth my rant,
I have posted this on a few EQ forums and it has ALWAYS been removed from
the server in less than a day (we'll see)
