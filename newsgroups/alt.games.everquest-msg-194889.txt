    Most newbie zones are like this. As an example, go to the Paineel newbie
garden and start whacking skeletons. Eventually you'll find a spawn point
where three or four appear at once, then wander away. As soon as you've
killed them all, you get respawn. I imagine the "slow respawn" newbie zones
were the ones that lacked this feature.
