No stats affect skill success, period.  Skill success is based strictly on
your skill level vs the trivial level of the item you are making, period.
This has been stated by whatever his name is that works on tradeskills at
Verant.  So, unless he is either mistaken or lying, I think that answers
that question.  STR is supposed to influence your chance of getting a
skillup in Smithing, not your chance of success.  There is still some
question about there being secondary stats for any other tradeskills, as
conflicting things have been said by this guy from Verant at different Fan
Faires.  I think it has been fairly well established that STR does affect
smithing skillups, as characters with high STR and low INT/WIS have managed
to learn smithing in a reasonable time frame.  I don't believe that anyone
has been able to empiracly (sp?) prove based on lots of experimentation if
there truly is a secondary stat for any other skill.  The Speculation is
that Dex is a secondary stat for Tailoring and for Fletching.  Again, if it
is, it only affects your chance of raising your skill level, not your chance
of success doing a combine.
