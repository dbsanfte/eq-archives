    This is quite an accomplishment. Pottery at 200, when the Idols allowing
it to go over 188 were patched in a short while ago shows a lot of
dedication. Tailoring 200, given you likely have no access to cultural
products as an ENCH, also shows dedication to the trades. But given that
dragon steaks are the only known way over 162 Baking, were discovered
recently, and require dragon meat, well, I suggest you check that list of
trades again. ;-)
