EK is huge.  Put some distance between yourselves.
The guy asked Inyidd to not kill steal his mobs, and Inyidd started arguing
with him about it.   Since clearly Inyidd didn't understand "kill stealing
rooted mobs" and wanted to argue about it I might have alerted his guildleader
too.  Not to get him in trouble.  So that someone in *Inyidds own guild* could
explain how this works.
We were playing peacefully in DSP yesterday when some bard suddenly decided he
needed the area we were playing in to kite his mobs.  (Another huge zone).  
When we asked him to kite elsewhere his response was "sorry, I need alot of
space to do this".  We gave it about 20 more minutes then sent a tell to his
guildleader.  End of problem.
