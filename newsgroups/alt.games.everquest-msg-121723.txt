I don't mind sometimes using dark empathy to heal others, but I shouldn't be
the group healer.  Yesterday in N Ro, another in the group I was in kept
complaining about me not healing him and letting him get low on health.  In
some situations I don't mind, but when there is a danger if I get too low on
health, I'm not giving more to someone else, even more so if they are
constantly complaining.  There was an open spot and we could have got a real
healer, but none of the other group found that necessary, as this one guy
was the ONLY one taking significant damage (doing just as much, if not less,
than most of us).  I was acting as the main tank as well.  Fortunately I
didn't have to listen to him for long, as he finally died and got mad and
disbanded.  I think no one else in the group was disappointed at this
(pleased maybe, or just indifferent).
    He then logged on as a high LV Wizard, and proceeded to nuke, instant
kill, every spawn.  I questioned weather or not this was against the "play
nice policy" (as the group was pretty annoyed at this), and tried to get him
to admit that he was doing this only for the intention of denying EXP to
those who were trying to benefit from the spawns (he wasn't looting, and
being the derv camp, you don't gain any faction from this).  I tried to get
him to admit this for a quick /report /petition to see if my theory was
correct (that he might get yelled at for it, if not worse).  He did have a
bit of intelligence and saw what I was trying to get him to do (incriminate
himself?), and soon left (very soon).
    I did heal others in situations that were appropriate (they were low on
HP, I was full, and not in danger of taking damage faster than I could
re-gain it).  I just don't think that a Necro should be EXPECTED to heal,
the way some expect druids to SoW (he was that bad about it).  The group I
was with (I wasn't leader, someone else was) stayed for quite a while
longer, others coming and going as needed (having to log, so invite others),
never going over 5, and almost never over 4 in the group, with myself and
the leader having spent 2.5 hours & got 3 bubbles EXP, including the loss
from a total wipeout by a yellow to me {highest LV in group}, even to me,
and 2 blues, 3 of which ganged up on my (buffed) pet, resisted the others'
spells, killed my pet, let me solo the yellow while the other 2 killed the
blues and almost the even (I'd leach lifed them, as well as siphon STR them
all too).

For those who still think a Necro is the cleric (sits and heals only) when
the cleric isn't around...here are a few differences.

Clerics HEAL -- Necromancers KILL
Clerics GIVE life -- Necros TAKE life
A Cleric wouldn't let others see them summoning a skeleton pet.
A necro finds your corpse, the cleric brings it back to life.
Clerics aren't in general disliked by most NPCs (that I've heard of).
Clerics (as far as I know) aren't that good soloers (able to solo yellow
cons, one after another without clarity or any mana/HP regen).
Necros do damage, Clerics fix damage.
You'd better not be sending the Cleric in as the main tank (unless you're in
the group of healing necromancers).
Clerics get to wear plate (and we don't)!!!! =( :( :( :( :( :(

By the way, I REALLY like the stats of "flayed skin" armor, but I REALLY
don't like that it's human/erudite only.  Anyone know of any good armor for
Dark Elf Necromancers?  I'm still in the cloth that I stole from dead orcs
(half or more of them I didn't even kill).
