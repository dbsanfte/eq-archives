    You know, that's exactly the impression I got. I'd levelled my main and
my primary alt up in the KPC (King-Priest-Champ) room, and it was a great
place for XP and dropped some fair loot. Now, there's this nasty mob that's
sitting right in the middle of the place, spoiling the entire area for
level-appropriate people. Stick this back in the LDC area, and it's OK.
