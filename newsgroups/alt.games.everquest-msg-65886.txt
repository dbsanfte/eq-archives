Well, a lot of them certainly would be willing to do so. It took us at
least an hour longer than usual to muster up a proper Naggy raid force.
Most everyone else was on the moon, I guess.

Yep. <grin> We *have* to have the red scale, and if you don't get it off
of Naggy before you make 53, the other options are considerably less
appealing, so I'm feeling extremely grateful and lucky that I got mine
out of the way on a mob that's relative cake compared to the ones I have
left.

That's far down the road. There's lots of people in our guild who need
to be well ahead of me in the "help with the epic" waiting list. For
example, we have a grand total of zero click stickers.

Thanks! I know that everyone says the Jagged Blade of War is crap and
all that, better weapons all over sleepers and ToV, etc. But damnit,
it's a symbol! It's an achievement. It's an ............. epic. And I
want it, if only to say that I got it.
