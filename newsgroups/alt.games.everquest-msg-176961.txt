Shaman does not get snare (other than weak clicky snare if Inny Shaman).
Shaman does not get evac.  Shaman does not get damage shields (except
for expensive potions via alchemy).  Shaman does not get ports (still
useful even with PoP).  Shaman has nothing I've seen comparable to the
Druid Skin line.  Shaman does not get anything quivalent to shared
wolfform.  That's a few of themost obviouss differences off the top of
my head.  Shaman is a great class, so is Druid.  They are only redundant
if you choose to make them so by self-crippling them in your play.  They
are quite capable of working effectively and efficiently in concert.
Other than that, I agree with your post.  :-p
