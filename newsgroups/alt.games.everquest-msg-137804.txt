 You can't really go wrong with Monk/Shaman. For me that's really the
best combination.

 However, I don't see why Monk/Necro wouldn't work. Snare+Fear+Pet+Monk
= Fairly painless XP.

 I could see Druid working but once you get in the upper levels you're
going to have downtime because your Druid can't keep up with the damage
being done to you.

 Could work. Would be tricky though taking on mobs at 50% health all the
time (excluding when Mend has recycled).
