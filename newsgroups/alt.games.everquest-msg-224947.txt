Any idea what kind of armor / weapons your group had?
We were playing last night with a group level 52 -55, should have been just
fine.  Group played well together.  We won both missions we took - one collect
and one slaughter, but both were *down to the wire*.  They weren't fun, they
were *work*.
Group was:
Necro, druid, chanter, warrior, ranger, cleric.
The chanter and I both had KEI, and the chanter kept C2 on the necro, druid and
ranger.
I was perpetually out of mana.  Necro kept feeding me hers, and I had every
mana buff the chanter had on me all the time.  My wisdom is over 255, and I
have a lot of *mana* gear.
I was pacifying for the ranger to pull, but that doesn't take much mana.  The
warrior and ranger just weren't putting out enough damage, and the necro kept
her pet in battle all the time.  The druid was nuking, damage shielding, and
backup healing.  I was casting a complete heal *every* mob, sometimes 2. 
I never had the nerve to ask what weapons / armor our fighters had but I am
pretty sure they were wearing hand me down crap.  It's the only explanation I
could come up with.
