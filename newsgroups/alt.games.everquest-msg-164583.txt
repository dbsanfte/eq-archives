 Ever noticed that they hate me so much, they collectively make my threads
so long ?  You can tell when frustration sets in because I get the ol'
Kill'file warning. Basically, if ya gotta kill file someone, then they have
proven that a bigger abusive ass has superceded ones abilities to continue
an attack. If your not attacking, hell, ya just gotta be retreating I say
!!!!

Attackers hate being attacked for it demoralizes them and they are forced to
defend themselves. I'll break a person, a couple, or a whole group. I guess
I just set my goals high :-)
