Why cant they split the patches up based on timezones?
Every time we need a new patch it seems to happen during prime time euro 
playing hours.
They do the patching for the benefit of the US players which is stupid 
as AB is a Euro server.
With Shadowbane due for release soon Verant better buck there ideas up 
and sort all this downtime with patches or theyll lose a lot of players.
