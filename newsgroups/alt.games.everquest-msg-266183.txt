It's not a fantasy at all.
You seem to not understand the connotations of PRIVATE PROPERTY.

It's Cryptic's game, Cryptic's world, Cryptic's rules.
You are allowed in their playground as long as you follow their rules.

They are the only one who have any say in the matter, period.

Just like an American who claims he has the right to free speech.
Not in *MY* house you don't.

You have no rights in CoH except those Cryptic CHOOSES to give you.

No.

They have said that persistent _activity_ will be harassment if it's
done to another player.

One "kill steal" is NOT harassment according to the rules of CoH, and
it's not going to be no matter how many times you insist it is.

Like it or not, and you obviously don't, it's NOT considered harassment
in CoH.

It has great bearing.

Healing someone else, buffing them, etc ARE NOT CONSIDERED HARASSMENT by
most players.

That's the crux of the matter.

ANY repeated activity done to another player, harmful OR beneficial is
harassment if they don't want it.

But it's oh so relevant since it shows your consistent desire to have
CoH do things the way some other game does them.

You made suggestions for how to "fix" the kill stealing "problem" that
included things that are against the fundamental mechanics and theme of
the game.

It was dealt with professionally.

You are insisting that when a customer complains about something that is
NOT AGAINST THE RULES, that support spend extra time questioning them in
order to see if maybe they've experienced something that might possibly
be against the rules even though what they actually complained about
wasn't.

If YOU are going to make a complaint, the onus is on YOU to make sure
you have a VALID complaint and to make that complaint CLEAR.

There isn't enough support staff nor man hours for them to play 20
questions with every whiner that hasn't bothered learning THIS GAME'S
rules.

You're saying the equivalent of "The players shouldn't have to learn the
rules, the staff should accommodate their laziness and lack of knowledge
instead."

Bullshit, the players are responsible for learning the rules here, just
as you are responsible for learning the Laws in your area in the real
world.

Ignorance is no excuse, and the WILLFULLY ignorant should not be given
special attention.

You'd have to show exactly HOW person X powerleveling is ruining your
enjoyment of the game.

They have addressed concerns about various powers and changed them.
They have changed the visuals and functioning of powers like Martial
Arts and Katana in direct response to players feedback.

Yet you keep going on about them "not keeping track" as though they toss
out every bit of feedback they get.

Oh, right.  
They haven't changed things to suit YOUR definitions so they MUST have
been throwing out all the complaints and feedback on the matter.

It couldn't possibly be that you are part of a tiny, but vocal minority.

It's Cryptic's world and they have defined how their world works.

They have the only say in the matter.
You can enjoy their world, or you can leave.

Have you completely lost the ability to read?

As YOU have said, people coming from OTHER games where kill stealing is
defined differently have complained about it.
You use this as "proof" that the CoH player base holds your definition,
because they brought that definition with them from another game.

If that were true, they'd be complaining just like they do in games
where the EQ definition is VALID.

They aren't, so that means one of a few possibilities;
1. There is no widespread "kill stealing problem".
2. They _don't_ have the same definition as you do.
3. Unlike KDragon and you, they realize that what another game's rules
are has nothing to do with CoH and complaining about something that's
not against the rules of CoH is pointless.

Regardless of which they are, the MAJORITY are silent on the matter.

You on the other hand are acting just like those self named "Moral
Majority" types, asserting that your way is the only right way, and that
the majority want things your way.

Perhaps you could stop trying to redefine everything.

No you didn't, that's the whole point.
You keep claiming you have provided proof, but all you've done is said
the same thing over and over again, as though merely asserting it makes
it true.

Remember KDragon, this is a thread that run off because of KDragon's
whine about kill stealing, GM response and CS response.

YOU SAID, directly referring to the experiences of KDragon, that CS
should have done more, instead of saying "Not a customer, we can't help
you."

KDragon: I did send an email after terminating my account, explaining
the whole  episode in detail. They answered that because I had
terminated my account, they were marking the petition as having been
resolved.

You: Just shows you haw far 'closing a ticket' can get from 'customer
service'.

At that point I came into this sub-thread with.

ME: You might want to think about how much 'customer service' they
should be giving to someone who has made it perfectly clear that he's NO
LONGER A CUSTOMER.

You have been thrashing about that ever since insisting that they SHOULD
have done more.

YOU:  Ah. I see. You appear to be very naive. 

1) A business that sends off its parting customer with a final insult
only further increases the unliklihood that the customer will ever
return, to any of its products. 

2) Plus further insulting ex-customers also incites them to make 
negative posts about your product and company, affecting the buying
decisions of their friends, families, and the people at large.

Sure there will always be a couple kooks who you can't please and who
want the moon. But most customers (even the ones who aren't your
customer any longer) are generally satisfied with a little sincerity and
respect.




Not a customer = not entitled to customer support.



Point 1: that you made - KDragon quit during the free period and had
made a complaint to a GM about something that was not against the rules,
that KDragon obviously never bothered learning.
He was not insulted, just told the rules.
He didn't even bother TRYING to explain, he quit out immediately.

Point 2: You're not a customer, we can't help you is NOT an insult.
The fact that YOU think it is says quite a bit about the unreasonable
amounts of "service" you desire.
No one forced KDragon to close his account BEFORE sending the email to
CS and had he not done so, his complaint WOULD have been processed.

Reasonable people know that if you want support from Company X, you'd
better be a customer of a Company X.


Your last comment: "Sure there will always be a couple kooks who you
can't please and who want the moon."

Your insistence that your definition is the only right one.
Your dislike of the mechanics that allow other people to heal you.
Your insistence that the GMs should bend over backwards to accommodate
people complaining about things that are not against the rules.
Your insistence that CS should provide support for people who aren't
customers.
You're one of those kooks you mentioned.

At the cost of what?   
There's a limited amount of money coming in and if it's going to
increased CS staffing then it's NOT available to pay for further
development.

You know, the 2 updates we've gotten for FREE, a third one on the way.

I guess they could follow the EQ model and SELL us the updates instead.

No thanks.


You want things done your way, and someone else can pay for it.

Why don't you write to Cryptic/NCPlay and suggest that they sell premium
accounts at, oh say $25-30 a month, and the people who have those
accounts get the handholding, commiseration and extra attention you
want.

Then YOU and your ilk can pay for what YOU want.
