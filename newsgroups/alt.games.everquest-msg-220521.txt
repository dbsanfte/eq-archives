This is correct.  The /assist method of determining agro on a mezzed mob
does not work.  And it does not work for the reason stated above.  Things
used to work differently, but it was changed a good while back and this is

All you can do with a mezzed mob is determine if memblur worked, using /con.
And then only if the mob is normally not threatening to you.
