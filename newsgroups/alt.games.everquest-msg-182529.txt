Bullshit.  Race is very real.  It's significance may be minor, but the fact
is real.  You can call it a superficial concept, and I'll agree, but to call
it artificial is simply incorrect.  As an artist, I can tell you that there
are many differences in people that are strongly influenced by their race.
It may not be meaningful, other to to describe how your will generally look,
but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

artificial concept.
