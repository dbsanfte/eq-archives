I played last night and enjoyed the new look very much, I can now open more
then two backpacks etc at a time.

Went to bazaar to tryt and purchase a skinning knife the laaaaaaaaaaag was
baaaaaaad. And to make matter worse no skinning knife.

Anyone on the Rathe have one they can sell, I would try to make it but the
knife molds seem not to be in game anymore. This makes me trying to work
tailoring skills much harder.

Thank you
