As I said elsewhere, they should have expanded the market cornering, so 
that each class had its niche... instead they applied genericness to the 
classes to ensure none have a unique niche.

I'd say its more precise to say that the classes have *no role* now. 
Their role is defined by their base: Priest, or Mage, etc. 

What is a cleric's role? To heal? Druids and Shaman do that too, and 
just as well.. to heal is the role of all priests... what is a CLERICS 
unique role? Nothing. They have some unique flavour, but it really has 
no relevance to the game.

EQ1 has a dozen+ classes, and half a dozen or so different 'roles'. EQ2 
has 4 roles, and 4 classes, 1 class for each (with some flavouring). Its 
disappointing.

Yup.
