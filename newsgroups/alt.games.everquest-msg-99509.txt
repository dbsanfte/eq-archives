If this is, indeed, the case then I think it's not very bad at all.
Could have been much worse indeed. I still think there's cause for
concern about 1 to 30 curve being so oversimplified, but that's more in
terms of people being able to keep up with their skills, afford spells,
weapons, gear, etc. rather than just making the 1 to 60 run suddenly
drastically "cheaper" in terms of effort expended, etc.
