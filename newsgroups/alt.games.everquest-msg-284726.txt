I've been looking around for this information for a long time, and found 
it deep in a thread on Allakhazam.  I went in and added the SK spell 
level.  The level of a pet is important for use in "pet pulling", where 
you want the highest level pet you can make which will be green to the 
mobs you are pulling, and for proccing weapons, which won't proc unless 
the pet is high enough level for their effect.
