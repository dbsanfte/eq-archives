Focus effects and other "always on" effects work regardless of level, if 
you can equip the item at all.  Clicky items and proc weapons won't 
work, just as they won't work on items without a reccomended level... 
but at least with reccomended level items you know which level they 
-will- work at, without having to go to an out of game database.

The regen from the CIB stacks with your natural regen, any buff regen, 
and the regen from most other items (all other items, I'm tempted to 
say); I think there's a cap as to how high HP can go, but thats like the 
FT cap, higher than I've ever gone.

The reason people say it drops off in effect is that the amount of hp 
per tic you get off it is a constant.  If you are level 1 with 34 hp to 
your name, and regen 5 extra HP per tic, the effect is immense.  At 24 
with 1200 hp, 5 extra HP per tic isn't even 1% extra regen.  At 65 with 
6k hp, you're never going to notice the difference.

How much any regen affects you is based on your class, degree of 
twinkage, and your play style, as well as your level.  My shaman lived 
and breathed regen up till hitting 44, at which point despite being a 
troll, having a CIB and several other regen items, and having a Fungi 
Great Staff for better regen than he could cast, HP regen became a 
little asterisk to his play; Stoicism was so much more effective than 
any degree of normal regen that it was no longer of more than a passing 
interest.

20K seems.. silly.  I paid under 5K for one over a year ago, and 
generally old frequently dropped items like this -drop- in value, not 
appreciate.

Splendid
