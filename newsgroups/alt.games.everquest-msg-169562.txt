I'm sorry, you just lost me... explain again how that's absurd?  Is it
because nobody is worthy to emulate a genius, or are you just pointing out
that well-known [sic] fact that the things that define genuis make everybody
else stupid idiots if they do them?

You prefer to play the game as a science and highly efficient and structured
contest.  That's fine.  Others prefer to play it as their own fantasy story,
which is also fine and, IMHO, far more fascinating than your way.  You don't
like it that they're making their part of the game more creative and less
scientific.  That's fine.  What's not fine is that, instead of simply
ignoring those people and playing with the ones who play the game your way,
you come up with reasons that their way of playing the game is wrong.  I
don't consider it a discourtesy if someone in my group is roleplaying and
chatting in their character's dialect... since you do, don't party with
them, but don't try to tell anyone else how to play.  I'm not trying to
start a flame but I think everyone should be allowed to play the game their
own way without being considered "wrong", unless of course they're being
deliberately insulting or offensive.
