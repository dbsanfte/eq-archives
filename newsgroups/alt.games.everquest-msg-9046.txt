Looks like your spell checker is broken again! I'd killfile your stupid 
ass, but it is *far* too much fun to watch you make a complete ass out of 
yourself pretty much every time you put your fingers on the keyboard and 
start typing. 

Needed a laugh, so I did a search on Google to re-read some of your old 
posts to this newsgroup. Great stuff! I especially liked the gem titled: 
"eq dOESN'T FUCKING suck! tHE WORKERS DO! iT WAS MY DAMN iDEA TO MAKE A 3d 
GAME LIEK THIS IN THE FIRST PALCE!".  

It's amazing that you ever got past 3rd grade!
