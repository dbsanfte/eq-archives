Hello, 

       To whom it may concern, and actually take time to help me. I'm very new
to EQ. I played Ultima ONLINE for like 2 years, and got sick of it. So, here I
am now. I'm a level 3 warrior. I don't know where the best places to go to earn
money, kill things since I'm new, and what items to sell. Right now I'm at West
Freeport. Anything of value would help.
