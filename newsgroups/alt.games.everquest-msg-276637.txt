That's just being arrogant. I could say the same of the guy who works 
his way up from fry guy to store manager.

Quite right, if you wanted to carry over the meaning of death in an 
mmrpg, it *should* be permanent.

As it is now... death in virtual worlds like EQ is barely a deterrent 
nevermind the "end of all". As it is I will suicide a raid target just 
to gauge its melee output. I will suicide rush a deep spawn just to see 
if a target I want to kill is up. (e.g. if there's no tracker, and I 
don't feel like spending an hour fighting my way in just to find out my 
target is down). Death HAS NO MEANING; I can trivially just summon 
corpse and rez it.

It would be -nice- if death did have a meaning... then I might try to 
avoid it.

Its the *only* way to handle it.

If it was just a matter of pride, maybe. But its more than a matter of 
prestige. It is -part- of the role-playing-game ethos that you are not 
you.

Its like a masque with people who show up out of costume. Mixxing the 
two tends to ruin the party for those who took the time to make a 
costume.

Masques work best if everyone wears one. Likewise, mmrpgs for 
roleplayers (they are the the RP in mmorpg after all and should be 
catered too) work best if the roleplayers don't have to share territory 
with the ebayers. Of course that ideal may never be practically 
acheivable, but legitimizing ebayers will only worsen the situation for 
the roleplayers. Better to just let them separate and run on a server 
where ebaying is strictly disallowed... its what they -WANT-.
