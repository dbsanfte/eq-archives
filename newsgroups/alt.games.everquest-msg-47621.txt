was goin through some posts and I was shocked that no one posted about this
yet (except for a negative post on it), and I'm bored so here goes, copying
from EQVault and putting links at the bottom


Friday, October 05, 2001 is turning out to be a big day for the release of
information about the Shadows of Luclin. The EverQuest team has released two
design documents for public viewing. The first document summarizes Luclin's
Alternate Advancement System and the second document details some features
of Luclin's new Graphics Engine.

That's not all though. Brad McQuaid made a surprising announcement regarding
the retexturing of Norrath.

"We are pleased to make this surprise announcement," said Brad McQuaid,
Chief Creative Officer & Vice President, Sony Online Entertainment.
"EverQuest players will be amazed at the clarity the texture upgrade
provides and we feel the gameplay experience will be richly enhanced."

Visit the Shadows of Luclin site for a comparison of the current graphical
look, and the upcoming look featuring the new textures.

How's that for interesting stuff!
