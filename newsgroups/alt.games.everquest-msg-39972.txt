A while back I would have thought such a service was silly too.  And then my
RL wife and I "got married" in EQ, complete with a ceremony conducted by a cleric,
and friends who scared the hell out of me by blasting themselves when the service
was over to provide some fireworks.  And you know what... it actually reminded me
of my RL wedding, and it really brought a lump to my throat.  It was friends gathered
together to celebrate a life event.  

The game is just a game.  Two years from now, I'm sure most of us will have moved
on to other games.  But the people we play the game with are real.
