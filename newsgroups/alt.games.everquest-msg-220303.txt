I like the guy after working befallen said lets go to freeport for a
drink. He then hands me drink and starts with the cyber stupidity. Its
like the drink will make me RL stupid, besides, I may have female
alts, but that doesn't make me attracted to males.

I basically walked out of the bar, and headed out to commons to return
to neriak. Finally after a load of tells about how hung he was, and
why wont I kiss him I decided to /ignore this gem of a teenager.

I feel bad for the poor girl who goes to the prom with him! 

One smoooooov operator.
