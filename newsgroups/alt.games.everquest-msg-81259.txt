Which ever of the 2 is higher , i.e if your WIS is 92 and your INT is 91,
your skill increase will be based on WIS.
  If your INT is higher then WIS your skill increase will be based on INT,
  Only exception is smithing skill,, that can be based on 3 skills, STR,
INT, WIS. Skill increases and success rate are based on what ever is highest
at the time.
   Ofcourse with bindwounds there is no success rate, you heal with a
bandage what ever your level+skill is, you will always  heal , unlike
smithing skill, you could get a "fail to combine" message, there is no "you
fail to bindwounds" if you get my drift.
  Hope this helps
