Not really, if God is indeed Omniscient, then he already knows all these
things.  Given those circumstances, he can create us such that we believe we
have free will and are exercising it, but, he already knows from the get-go
how it's going to turn out.  If he does not know this, then he cannot be
Omniscient.  You can't have it both ways.  It has nothing to do with the "If
he's so perfect..." argument.  By definitions if he is omniscient, he
posesses all knowledge of everything.  If you are willing to concede that he
is not omniscient, then we can have free will.
