I'll second that recommendation for mwave.  I've used them for almost all of
my PC upgrades for the past few years.  I also check pricewatch.com to make
sure mwave is at least in the ballpark.  I feel much better ordering from
known, trusted sources.

They're what an online business *should* be: low overhead (simple, no frills
web page), focused on a specific field (none of this amazon.com "sell
everything and then some" crap), and decent prices.  I hope they're making
decent money.
