Ahh, that would be fun but ... you're encouraging a bunch of packrats here!

Mine is a slim, purple slip cover case over cheap cardboard inner box. 
Classic Microprose stuff of the era.

> MOO,

Very nice packaging, one of the early slip cover boxes with a deep, hard 
cardboard generic white box under a majestic slip cover ("Build an Empire to 
Span the Galaxy"). The box is big enough to hold the 4 floppies, patch 
disks, all the printed readme files and Emrich's strategy guide (back when a 
strategy guide was a strategy guide, remember that?), and no bulging. My 
receipt shows that I bought it at Computer City on 10/08/93, along with Joe 
Mac: Caveman (*LOL*), Wing Commander Academy and New Math Rabbit .

 > X-Com,

Another one of the thin, cheap cardboard Microprose era boxes, I've got one 
here that's still unopened. Not sure why, but I guess I knew even then that 
it would be one of *the* classics.

> speech packs,

I bought all the originals of these, but I think I went back later and 
picked up the collections and those are the only ones that survived, I don't 
seem to have the originals anymore. For example, my WC and WC2 boxes are 
both hard cardboard gift box style, and include the games and all expansions 
(Secret Missions, Special Ops, Speech Paks) in each of the two boxes. I 
think those must have been some kind of compilation, like some of today's 
Gold collections.

> SWOTL and all expansions, Kilrathi Saga, all XW/TF and
> expansions,

I have a whole shelf full of Star Wars games, including the original XWing 
and various add-ons (e.g., B-Wing) as well as the Collector's CD Edition. I 
spent more time playing XWing than any game of that era, man I *loved* that 
game. To this day, when I hear the Star Wars combat music (not the theme, 
but the combat scene music), what comes to my mind is being out on missions 
in the original XWing. Tie Fighter got more accolades and was a better game 
in many ways, but you know what they say about your first ...

Hmm, had Anachronox but neither of those others. Depends on how obscure you 
wanna get. How about Dark Legions, remember that one? One of the really 
early multiplayer games using IPX as a transport. Merchant Prince, a sweet 
multiplayer IPX game from QQP, really the precursor to Patrician. Those QQP 
guys were way ahead of the curve in multiplayer support.

Heh, I don't know about that. Technology moves so fast, they already look 
ancient. But it's fun thinking back on the good times we had playing them, 
and the nice production values that *used to* go into delivering them to the 
market.
