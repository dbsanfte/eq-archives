2hders are better than 1hders when you're either a Knight class or not
actually the Tank of the group. I found a decent 2hder will normally
outdamage 1hders of the same level but although you can actually hold aggro
with a 2hder a string of misses and an unfortunately timed heal, debuff or
slow can lose it and it'll can be a hard job getting it back again. Fast
1hders are what you should normally be using, I only ever pull out my 2hder
these days when the mob has a Damage Shield and then put it away once it's
dispelled. As a Warrior (weapons wise) you should concentrate on having the
best 1hders you can and then grab a Kunark or Velious 2hder on the cheap.

For a cheap one look out in the Bazaar for Velium Claidhmors and Battle
Axes, Felhammer (seen this for 500pp recently) or 2hb the Sarnak Warhammer
is likely under 500pp.
More expensive, the Black Acrylia Halberd looks a nice weapon (actually it
does LOOK a nice weapon but it's stats are good as well) but this will be in
the 7k region, also Bob's Axe (Doljonijiarnimorinar) and Truncheon of Doom
are worth a look. If you have a large budget then go search the Bazaar for
2hders, there are some awesome ratios out there now.
