Eh, I don't get that implication from it.  I get "this is a way". Possibly 
along with "and this is the way you will be graded on on the test".  I've 
never personally taken the fact that it's the correct answer on the test 
to mean that it is the be-all and end-all of solutions, but that could 
just be me.

Bah, those posts expired on me.  As I recall, that's one of the statements 
that was disagreed with, but not the only one, and I took the poster of 
the teacher-quote to be the least disagreeing with it, since she posted 
helpful advice rather than condemnation.
