I think a cleric healing a bard is a weak combination. Your bard is
more suited to gimic fighting (fear/kite/charm) than constant melee.

Your old combo was a tank/healer. Sounds like you are wanting to try
something new.

Necro, druid, ranger, or shaman would make an interesting combo. You
could be a wood elf couple (bard/druid or bard/ranger) or I suppose
human bard + dark elf necro. Have your bard work on getting dark-elf
like faction: dark bard + necro would be interesting.
