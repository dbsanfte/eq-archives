Same here, I never purposefully tried to stay lower level though. As a
guild we just never seemed to bother with naggy or vox when I was
around. At the time kunark had just come out and we were just getting
into fear and hate a lot, which were more for everyone rather than a
long dragon encounter you screw up on a lot at level 50 -51 to only
get like 3 things.

WW is really pretty cool. You can pull some doable outdoor dragons,
which makes everything easier, and still feel like you are killing
dragons. Honestly on a WW outting people of the appropriate level
might get more good stuff doing several wussy dragons than doing vox
or naggy (if they still could)

I'd recommend WW and just call them dragons. It looks like a dragon
so hey, its a dragon. Best part is the fodder ones are nearly always
up with no one doing them. Its a fun, lower risk and low pressure
outting without having to rush to spawns like Trak or Tov or other
ones that people try to nab ASAP.
