That rings a few bells. :ï¿½/

One of my RL friends and Guild members joined in with the attack on FV when
she appeared (on Bristlebane, although I'm not sure what zone this was, I
can't see it being GFay)
I had a go at him about this (well called him an Arse) but since he is an
Iksar SK I guess it wasn't out of character, as such. Anyway, he is KoS in
FV, as an Iksar Shadow Knight that is hardly surprising but whenever he
kills something that would give him faction in FV he gets the Message that
his faction cannot possibly get any better there, seems he's stuck as KoS
there. I hope this is due to his actions of attacking FV when she appeared
(and messing up a story line) and all the other players that joined in with
killing her suffered the same fate, from what I heard, they weren't all Evil
class/race characters.

CF
Not seen a GM event since I've been of a level where I might survive it.
