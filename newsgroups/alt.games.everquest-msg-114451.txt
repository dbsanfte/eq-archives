The only one I have available for testing is the cheapest horse.
I've done numerous timing tests on it, and it's 10% faster
than normal (unassisted) run speed.  For comparison, JBoots
are 35% faster, and the enhanced run ability that you can
earn with the Alt Advancement points (50+) are 10%, 20%, and
30% faster (for the first, second, and third advancement
levels).
