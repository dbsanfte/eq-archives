*shrug*
There appears to be no shortage of opinions on this.  Those using it
clearly intend it to be a synonym for "tips", and clearly expect to
recive "the usual" most of the time and something better once in a
while.  It's common usage.  I've never done it, but I still think your
characterization of those who do as idiots is unfair and unreasonable.
Face it biz, the game is full of idiots.  And compared to the routine
idiocy I see, this "abuse" (if you want to call it that) doesn't rate
at all...

There's got to be someting more interesting to rant about out there.
