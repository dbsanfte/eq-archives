I presume the you meant:

" It matters enough that there are zero active level 65 dark elf warriors on
my server and more ogres than you can shake a stick at."

The only benefits that ogre have over other races is that they can't be
stunned from the front and 40 odd sta more at creation. At level 56 with my
shaman, i have 255 sta buffed. You wont lose that many HP at the end and
gear can make up for (almost) anything.
