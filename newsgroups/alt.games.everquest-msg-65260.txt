I have a voodoo 3 running with Win98se, got hold of DX8.1 put that
on...ran EQ...no problems, no need to upgrade the video drivers or sound
as warned to get things to work (I have a couple of direct X8 games
already so I may have grabbed the upgrades already though).

Zoning took longer (about twice as long as normal, reducing as I put more
zones in or shuttle back and forth across one zone line [BB/QH]) but im on
a 56k, I've always had to wait a long time, and I guess theres more
detailed stuff being sent across....at least skeles look really good now.
