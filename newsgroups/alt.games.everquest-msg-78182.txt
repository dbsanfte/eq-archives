That was my one of my main problems with the movie, as well.  I mean, Liv
was easy on the eyes, but the rest of the elves seemed... not quite as fair
as I would have expected.  Of course, my cousin pointed out that Elrond may
as well be elvish, as he certainly doesn't look human ^_^;;;;;  Of course, I
forgot that he's really 49.99999999% elven.

Try a six month deployment.  They played it twice a day, twice a week.

My other really big beef with the movie was the fact that they gave away
Aragorn's lineage waaaaaaaaaay too early.  IIRC (understand, I haven't read
the books since I was fifteen... over a decade ago), they did not disclose
that Aragorn, not Borimor, was the true king until the third book (hence the
title).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
