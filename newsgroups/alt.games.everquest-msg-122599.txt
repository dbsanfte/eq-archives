I often get asked to transfer stuff for complete strangers when im in 
NFP, and of course help them if i can (ALWAYS full on backpacks, so cant 
transfer bags), and as Ken say, a reputation for a tradeskiller means a 
LOT on a server, if i would be stupid enough to steal an item from 
someone it would SERIOUSLY harm my business. Actually went LD once while 
helping someone do a transfer, luckily one of my friends play EQ too, 
and was online, so i could tell the guy i was coming right back.

Personally i dont think i would trust a non-guildie or RL friend with 
high end gear. Had a guy who needed help with a transfer, and since i 
was just sitting in NFP i didnt mind helping, and this complete stranger 
hand over 1 Fungi, 2 SoS, 2 AC 6 hp 55 rings, Footpads of the Tiger, 
some more monk armor, mainly Wu armor (before Acrylia armor). I count 
that as stupid, even IF the guy you get help from are a tradeskiller 
have a reputation, its still a BIG shitload of money to fork over to a 
stranger.
