Probably a good policy that I should adopt. Got the standard "female woodelf
begger" a couple of times on different days in Qeynos. Got me to thinking,
so for the next couple of hours I checked their level and sure enough, still
level 1.

I figure what they are doing is creating/deleting and moving around
characters who's sole purpose in the game is begging.

As far as keeping notes. I was screwing around somewhere in the Karanas and
I get a tell ~"Do you want to help a newbie fellow ranger?" First thought I
had was "WTF is a newbie ranger doing out here?" so I /w ranger and they
aren't on the list.

So eliminating the chance for near misses, I just /w all <name> and they
show up in Surefall, which begs the questions "How did they know my name to
beg 3 zones away?"

Tough one to figure for sure, but apparently the beggers are keeping a list
too. I wonder if they share names or just keep the list to themselves.
