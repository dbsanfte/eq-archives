Because the moment you give the government the
power to shut down those kinds of radio stations
or web sites, they also have the power to shut
down sites that are embarrassing to or disagree
with the people in power.

Our philosophy is that it's better to allow
a few nuts to spew garbage than it is to let
the government be in the position of deciding
what voices are "allowed" and which ones will
be banned.
