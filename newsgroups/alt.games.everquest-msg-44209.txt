What class & level is your primary character who's doing the twinking?
In case you're willing to put in the time, you don't have to be a
warrior to *do* the crafted armor quests, just to wear the stuff. If
you're twinking with a druid, necro, whatever... particularly a porting
class, you could get a full suit probably faster and cheaper by doing it
yourself. 
  I never see full suits of crafted being sold on our server. Generally
it's somebody who has finally gotten something better for *one* slot and
is selling off the old crafted piece to recoup part of the cost. And the
minimum you'll usually be charged is twice the cost of the gem(s)
required to quest the piece. And more often it's passed down to a
guildie with a lower level warrior main/twink. So there's very little of
it for sale. I know I'll be passing mine down when I start getting my
Vellious quest armor.
  You may want to just consider a quick world tour to pick up all the
items and a trip to the gem vendors for the gems, and head to SK to get
it all yourself.
