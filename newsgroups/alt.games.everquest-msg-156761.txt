**********************************
I've been following the threads here and on the Ranger's Glade about Harmony
today and wanted to give some more information on the reasoning behind the
change.

Harmony is the druid and ranger version of the lull line of spells. Several
classes get these types of spells, with enchanters, bards, and clerics being
the best at it overall. Lulls work by lowering the range at which monsters
will attack you, allowing you to pull a single monster out of a group by
lulling it's companions.

Traditionally, most lull spells haven't really worked very well. Lull had a
high resist rate and wasn't very reliable. We've recently looked at lulls
and improved the way they work to make them more useful to players. You
should find that the lull line of spells works more often than it did,
though it will still fail some of the time.

Harmony was unique in that when you cast it on an NPC, it never failed. This
essentially means that Harmony could be used for risk-free pulling every
time. All other lull spells have a resist check, allowing a monster to not
be affected by them. The fact that Harmony can't be resisted made it the
very best of the lull spells - which is an odd thing to happen to a level 5
spell.

We've had the ability for awhile now to make it so certain monsters were
totally immune to being lulled. This is especially common in higher level
outdoor zones such as Cazic-Thule, since Harmony would take any challenge
out of splitting groups of monsters. Having a such powerful game dynamic
with no risk of failure made these encounters too easy, so we were forced to
make many monsters totally lull immune to compensate. With this change to
Harmony, we'll now be able to remove the lull immunity from many monsters,
and turn this ability into a useful spell line that gives great benefits,
but with some risk that your spell may be resisted.

This week, we'll be adding an upgrade to Harmony that works on higher level
monsters. We'll also be removing the lull immunity from many higher level
monsters in outdoor zones, to accommodate the new spell. The higher level
version of Harmony will have some chance of being resisted, but will be a
fairly reliable way to split up groups of outdoor monsters. We do want this
spell line to be a useful tool for you at all levels, but as with all other
forms of crowd control there needs to be some chance that it won't always
work. Druids and rangers should get a excellent outdoor lull, but a level 5
spell probably shouldn't be the best it ever gets.

- Rich
