well, most of my exp was from 25th to 35th cazic thule.  At around 35th you
wanna hit or at least try out Lower Guk.  Even if you wanna try out all the
newest lands, you definitely wanna still get a little exp in the old lands
to get a feel for it and have the fun / exp all the old folks like me went
thru.  : )
