This is incorrect, at least in the state I live in (Minnesota).  The
various local governments have essentially no direct power, and very
little indirect influence, over the local school boards.  The members
of the school boards are elected directly by voters residing in the
reasonably accurately named Independent School Districts.  The state
government does have significant influence over the school districts,
as approximately half of the schools' funding comes from the state,
but the exercise of that influence waxes and wanes with the level of
dissatisfaction the people have with the schools.  When people are
unhappy with the performance of the schools they not only vote out
some or all of the school board members they also tend to lean on
their state legislators in the (usually mistaken) belief that somehow
a state-wide mandate is going to make things better.  Once the state-
wide initiative(s) have failed (several years and lots of tax dollars
later) public opinion shifts again and the state gets told to "keep
your hands off our schools, local problems need local solutions" (by
this time new school board members have hopefully gotten clued in),
and so the cycle continues.  Of course, if more people would just get
involved with their local schools and more parents would take an
active hand in their own children's education, we'd do a better job
of bringing our kids up and have lower tax bills besides, but too
many people just want to wave a magic wand and be done with it.
