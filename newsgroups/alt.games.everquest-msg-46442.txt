I downloaded "the Rogue Report" and found it to be a concise booklet of all
a Rogue needs.  It has Skills, Weapons, Armor, Poisons, tradeskills, Zone
locations and much more.  It even has instructions for printing in booklet
form in Word.

I downloaded it over a month ago so check the zip download with antivirus
for safety...
