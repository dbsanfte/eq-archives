Snare then root then shoot.
Keep Snare on so that when root breaks they walk instead of run.
Be just far enough away that you can re-root before they reach you.
Run to where they were when previously rooted and repeat.
So you keep swapping places with them.
And yes, it takes a LOT of arrows!

I bow-kited crazed goblins through level 35 (aka Hell no.1) it was taking
about 40-50 arrows per kill and got about 1 point in archery per kill.
