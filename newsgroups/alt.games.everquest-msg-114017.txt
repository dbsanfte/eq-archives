53 and 46. Monk and Shaman.

I was thinking about twinking an Iksar Necro to. There are still
a lot of Kunark zones I have not explored. I am starting to get my friends
into exploring Kunark more. Its great have a whole dungeon to
yourself or your group many times.

I have another one on the FV server as well but don't play it much.
Only level 21 I think.
