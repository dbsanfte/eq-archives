Um...did you actually read the article?  That is almost, but not
quite, entirely unlike anything he said.

The article talks about how newbie _players_ and the expectations they
bring from other virtual worlds can demand that the new worlds they
come to incorporate the very features that caused them to leave the
original world in the first place.  Though it discusses possible
solutions, it's entirely descriptive, not at all prescriptive.
