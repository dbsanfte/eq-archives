Surely this is what Verant wish to avoid; negative
publicity about the game.

They would also lose the monthly fee coming in
from the account.

I believe that Verant simply wish to avoid any
legal snarl-ups that may occur from buying or
selling an account, and that is the only reason
that they do not sanction the practice.

They themselves have said that they will not
enforce the rule.

They also get some brownie points from the
(relatively) hardcore brigade, who dislike the
selling and buying of accounts on the principle
that anyone joining the game should start from
zero, and do the hard (boring) work to reach a
higher level. The sort of sentiments that the
majority of people in this ng espouse.

I think, that in future MMORPG's, companies will
sell customised accounts. The more equipment you
order, or the higher level you start at, or the
more zones you have access to... then the more it
will cost you. 

Perhaps one day, it may be possible to buy items,
or upgrade your level, on demand, for real cash,
whilst actually in the game. 

The Legends server may be an early example of
this.

You understand that I am not advocating this
approach, I am simply making a forecast as to
where free enterprise may lead MMORPG's in the
future.
