Then he's being trained there, I think.  I've played an Ogre from
scratch on Test without ever seeing a Bouncer near the book.  And
characters of mine on other servers have used the Oggok (Feerrott)
book to get in and out of Rathe Mountins many times without ever
seeing a Bouncer anywhere near the book.  The Bouncers that hang
near the bridge seem to be slow to return to their posts when
trained away, I'd guess it's one of them trained to the book by a
character heading to PoK from Rathe.
