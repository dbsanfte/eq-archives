Not necessarily true, but could quite be!!!

A little while back, I as a test, setup two hotmail accounts to test my Spam
theories.

1st one was a common name account i.e.  JoeSmith@hotmail.com
2nd one was a convoluted one  i.e.  qwerty12345asdf@hotmail.com

Never posted or advertised either address over three weeks.

1st account received several  hundred spam messages, 2nd account remained
empty.

So the spammers must use generic name generators as well!!

Just to update anyone who cares.  I created two new yahoo email addresses
with all the same options about 10 days ago, I posted once with one of them
here in this newsgroup, and have not used either of them for anything else
at all since then.  So far, I have recieved 3 spam emails to the one I used
for posting, and none to the one I have not used.  I imagine that over
time, the spam will build up, it usually does, but it does appear that
email addresses do indeed get snagged from this ng in particular.
