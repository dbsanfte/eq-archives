The cleric epic is outclassed at level 56 by a summoned hammer, the 
spell for which is available in the shadowhaven cleric guild for 6pp.

6pp, or weeks spent getting epic.

By 65 your buddy should have involuntarily gotten Hammer of Damnation 
more than once while handing in spectrals, and be able to do 100 times 
the damage with it as he could hitting (well, missing) anything he's 
fighting for exp, as his low 1hb skill cap means he won't actually be 
hitting much at all, but the proc rate will remain the same, and the 
proc is unresistable.

I had at least 3 better weapons (for melee purposes) than epic  before 
they added the summoned hammer to the game, and I wasn't in anything 
close to an uber guild.

Epic goes in your bag and comes out when you want the better stats and 
promise not to have any occaision to hurt anything, or when someone 
dies, or when you want to impress the little people.

(not to say it isn't the most useful epic in the game, mind you, but if 
it -also- had FT3 or something like the wizard epic, you might see more 
clerics actually not embarassed to have the thing equipped)
