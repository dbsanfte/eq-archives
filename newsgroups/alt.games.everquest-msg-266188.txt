The term existed long before EQ as well.

It's dependant on two things.
The rules of the game.
The way the mechanics of the game handles things.

I've played games where the last blow gets all the exp, no matter who
did the most damage.

I've played games where the first person to hit it, owns it and gets all
the exp no matter who kills it.

I've played games where you are auto-teamed if you're attacking the same
critter and get equal shares.

I've played games like CoH, where your "share" of the exp is exactly
linked to how much damage you did.

and so on

Kill stealing is not, and can not be defined the same in all cases.

It's NOT a universal term and it never has been.

It's Cryptic's game, it's Cryptic's rules and they can define things in
THEIR PROPERTY any way they like.

If they want to define "Banana" as meaning "super hero", then welcome to
"City of Bananas".
