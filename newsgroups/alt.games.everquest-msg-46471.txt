Heck, I was going to recommend that duo, but wood elf druid/gnome mage
as an alternative to the ranger/wizard suggestion. You get
transportation, ghetto tracking, all the healing you'll need, a pocket
tank and nukes, in addition to having the language learning without
having to cross half of Norrath. The druid would be stuck as neutral
(not fair!) and the magician could choose to be neutral to avoid any
alignment conflicts.
