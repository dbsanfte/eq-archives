Druid illusions? :)
Maybe enchanter such....

But what your EQ said was right - they were just that: corpses...
Some (probably) high level got bored and decided to have some
fun by changing form and then dying so he could have multiple
"objects" there....

Also happens with werewolves, trees and the like.
Most funny thing so far I have ever seen was when I was decorating
the tunnel entrance with tons of silver and copper pieces, and the #
occasional gold piece, and this stupid newbie tagging along picking up
 EVERY SINGLE COIN right after I dropped them OR after he found
my trail again (I invised on him several times).
Then this chanter (who was levitated) I was grouped with just turned
 _himself_ into a coin! There, try to loot that, stupid lowbie!

Best Regards,
