Actually, you just need "a" target - you can target other players, pets,
boats that you wouldn't otherwise be able to attack and practice Instill
Doubt against them (and, last I understood, actually recieve skill points
for it). Similarly, you don't actually have to be in melee or even visual
range of the target.

Monks get Install Doubt at Level 18, if I'm not mistaken, and it's one of
the more visual and fun skills, if perhaps more limited in its actual
usability.
