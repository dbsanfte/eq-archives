You will not evade me, Obscure_Reference_29346

Remeber when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave
because I'd go berserk?

WELL

You left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see
I've gone completely out of my mind

AND

They're coming to take me away HA HA, they're coming to take me away HO HO
HEE HEE to the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be
happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats and they're
coming to take me away HA HA!

You thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you LAUGHED when I had said
that losing you would make me flip my lid.

RIGHT!?

You know you laughed, I heard you laugh. You laughed and laughed and
laughed and then you left but now you know I'm utterly mad.

AND

They're coming to take me away HA HA, they're coming to take me away HO HO
HE HE HA HA to the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds
with basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and
they're coming to take me away HA HA!

I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back
for all my kind unselfish loving deeds.

HUH!?

Well you just wait they'll find you yet and when they do they'll put you in
the ASPCA you mangy mutt.

AND

They're coming to take me away HA HA.....
