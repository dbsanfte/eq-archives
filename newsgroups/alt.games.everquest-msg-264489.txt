Ah yes, Merciless Melody is a level 14 Bard song/group buff. A recent patch 
note states that it "has had its haste enhanced", so you're right and I've 
updated my spell notes to reflect this. Don't know about the troubadour 
charm since that's a post-20 phenomenon that I haven't yet been exposed to 
(and I haven't seen more than a half-dozen bards, none over 20). I'll keep 
an eye on that one, too. Sounds thematically consistent with EQ Live bards, 
however. Thanks for the info.
