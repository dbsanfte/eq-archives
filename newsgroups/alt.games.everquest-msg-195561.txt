The Silver-plated leggings have been 500ish for around 3 years now,
and it isn't because of their stats.  Rather, I expect it is for
exactly the reason the OP wants something like them:  the female
chain graphics in EQ were apparently designed by some pasty faced
23 year old who sits for hours in his mother's basement abusing
himself while gazing rapturously at the drawings in the Heavy
Metal magazine he swiped from his big brother 11 years ago.
