I thank you for your response.  It is helpful.  What I've done is
irreversible, and I'm certain other men have been treated like that.
I went overboard, and it may be hard to understand this, but it was helpful
to me.  I'm not a misogynist, but there are a few women who think it's ok to
lead a guy on in an online game, get him to care about your RL shit, and
then ignore him when he askes WTF is going on.  I think she's one of those,
but I didn't realize it when I met her.  This wasn't a "lets get together
this Saturday and cyber sex" thing.  It was more insidious.  I got to know
her through her expository comments about her life, and my natural curiosity
from them.  She made certain I knew about her, lol.  And then she slowly
drifted away when I wouldn't run to play with this character of hers, or
that one.  I asked her what was the nature of this "relationship" and I
would get no answer.  I just wanted to end it, so I did what I did.  Sure
it's arrogant, rude, selfish, but I think I deserved a little of all that
for myself after caring WAY TOO MUCH about her in the past.
