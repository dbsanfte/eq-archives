Different strokes...I preferred (still do) to use the belts for xp, faction
and the minor cash than to sell them.  I prefer to be a level higher than to
have money...but that's me.  I've never done the DF belt quest but the CB
belts still net a few gold minimum so I think turning them in is the best
way to go (IMO).

Velium weapons are lots cheaper...they SHOULD sell for no more than fine
steel since you get the same amount of money from NPCs for either, but I
have no idea how much either actually sell for.  I used to sell FS for about
1p over what NPCs would give me (even then I heard bitching!) back in my
mid-20s when my druid was able to bind in Kelethin, pop over to Cazic Thule
and buy it for about 1p less than a vendor would give me for it (back before
Kunark).

He said something that made it sound like he was in my position at level
11...not all my level 9s were bought yet.  I was always broke until 19 or
so.
