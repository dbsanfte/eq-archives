Lance and Shane have both stated most of what I would have told you, I'll
just reinforce by stating that your life as a Shaman is definitely going to
change when you get your pet. He's an incredible addition that will be most
valuable to you from the time that you get him (34) and then for a long time
therafter (although how useful will depend on your playstyle).

As has been said, a big key to optimizing your pet's damage output is to
buff him up and then get him positioned behind the mob. This means that
someone with greater aggro will be facing the mob, and if you're soloing
that means *you*. But I would argue that you *want* to be soloing a lot
during this stage in order to build up your Defense and Dodge skills, so
that later when you're fulfilling your role in a group setting, you'll be
able to take the occasional necessary hits from root parking, Slow aggro, or
even off-tanking. It'll also help you raise your Piercing (for your Epic) or
other weapon skills. Solo, and learn to get good at it. It's a rewarding,
productive experience, thematically consistent with the Shaman's high level
of independence. Your pet will drastically re-shape this experience for you.

Learn how to use the various pet commands. A critical one is "/pet guard
here", which has the effect of parking your pup at a particular spot, to
which he will return after every fight. You can park him there and run
around the entire zone looking for pulls, otherwise his default behavior
will be to follow you around.

Another thing to keep in mind is that some of the pets have to be purchased
from a Shaman out in the Karanas and are not available at your guild. You
might want to buy up as many of the future ones as you can afford and bank
them in order to save yourself the trip later.

Good luck and have fun with your new companion!
