There is a reason the southeast of the USA is called the "bible belt".  Feel
free to try and continue your inane personal attack in hopes of coming
up with an actual point though.

And talk about semantics.  "Did" or "would if they would have read it" is a
silly distinction to latch on to.  Then again, if you've got nothing better
you work with what little you have eh?

"Palindrome" has little room to make fun of my play-on-words name.   =P

Your post?  Where you think I was claiming to be the leader of the
southeast, when actually I was just *aware* of the fact that the "bible
belt" is full of religious conservatives.  Yeah, delusional.
