I finally broke down and downloaded (and paid for) magelo.  I'm having
problems making it work though.  When I try to input my aa's it gives me a
field to imput # of unspent aa's, but no visible accept button.  If I just
press the keyboard enter key it says "security exception".  I went to the
forums but when I try to click on any forum it just takes me back to the
forum menu.  It looks like it tries to take me to the forum but doesnt
succeed.  I went to 'Settings' and noticed that the 'Rights' section has 6
unchecked boxes (rank, member, forum, news, event, and poll) and I cannot
check them.  It does acknowledge I am a 'premium' user.  I sent an email to
magelo a few days ago but havent heard back.  Any ideas what could be wrong?
