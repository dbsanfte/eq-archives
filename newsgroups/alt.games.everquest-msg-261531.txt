True.  The answer should probably include at least a sentence or two
about how you get them and what sorts of things they involve.  Mainly
because, if the answer doesn't give that info, how is a newbie supposed
to figure out that they need to talk to a Task Master?  (Well, maybe if
they notice the NPC at all they'll figure it out, but frankly I've seen
enough cluelessness not to count on it. :-)

Sorry, I didn't make my point clear.  What I was aiming for was an
answer that left room for the possibility that patches might make the
tasks more balanced.  I.e., enough wiggle room so that the answer stays
accurate over time without misleading the reader.  So what I wanted to
say was that when the tasks first got added, some people (and you're
right, I should make it clear what sort of people) felt they were too
hard, but maybe tasks have been made easier since then and the FAQ
hasn't caught up yet.  Giving a time reference gives some idea how
stale the answer might be.

Anyway, you make several good points.  I've filed them away in case I
ever do get suckered into taking over the thing. :-)
