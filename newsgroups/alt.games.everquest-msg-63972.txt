maybe this then?

I Want It Now!
I want a feast 
I want a bean feast 
Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts so good you could go nuts. 
No, now! 
I want a ball 
I want a party 
Pink macaroons and a million balloons and performing baboons and 
Give it to me now. 
I want the world, 
I want the whole world. 
I want to lock it all up in my pocket 
It's my bar of chocolate 
Give it to me now! 
I want today 
I want tomorrow 
I want to wear them like braids in my hair and I don't want to share them 
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter 
Ten thousand ton of ice cream 
And if I don't get the things I am after 
I'm going to scream! 
I want the works, 
I want the whole works! 
Presents and prizes and sweets and surprises in all shapes and sizes, 
And now! 
Don't care how I want it now! 
Don't care how I want it now!
