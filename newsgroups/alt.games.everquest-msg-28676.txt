I dunno about that...   most of Kunark and some of the more intensive
Velious zones can really spit out the poly count (Wakening Land and Warsliks
Woods come to mind...)

I tend to choke a little on nearly any kunark zone and some velious zones,
as well as having about 5 seconds of graphic lag every time i pop my head
into the EC tunnel, or any raids (saw one in Highpass, what's up with that?)
on my Voodoo 3 3000, and a friend with a GeForce 1 has nearly the same
results.  Note: this is even after fixing around with my clip plane and
(especially when those bastards are spamming sentinel in EC tunnel) spell
effects.

But yeah, for the most part
