I'm a lvl 21 Barbarian Shaman and about 3/4 of the way to 22.  Exp gain has 
really slowed down.  Currently I'm hunting crocs in South Ro Desert which are 
dark blue to me.  They give decent exp except they become really scarce at 
times and I sit around waiting.  Can I get some suggestions to other zones I 
could hunt in as I progress into the 20s?  Preferrably with lots of dark 
blues, whites, and even a few yellows here and there.  I also like to solo so 
a place where I could pull and fight one mob at a time would be even better.  
I also only own EQ Classic.  Waiting to get Evolutions pack when it comes out 
in August.
