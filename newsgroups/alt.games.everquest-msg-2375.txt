   I hear where you're coming from BUT some people like a little game of
chance in their game of adventure.  While, yes it's true, that there is a
possibility(thiough not a probability) of you gaining less than your equal
share, there is also the possibility of getting more than your share.  One
of tyhe groupps i adventure with uses this method and i gotta say i like it.
bBetter odds than the lottery.    No, there's certainly no reason why you
shouldn't be paid equally for the time and effoert exerted.  Simply bow out
graciously (as you didi) and find another group (which you also did).
