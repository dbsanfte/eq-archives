I have a question about how to get my shackle of dust again. When I created
the character, I gave Grand Master Glox the note and in return get a shackle
of dust. Not knowing anything about the shackle quests I destroyed it  once
I get a decent bracer. Now Im trying to start the shackle quest. I went
through the process of getting it back........(got the hammer of exoneration
which procs bones to be put in the mortar and pestle form the mortician,
once 8 are combined then putting them into the penance bag for the
Toilmaster along with the blood flask).
My question is ...Who do I take the Penance bag to when its full?
I took it to Glox and he said he didn't need it but took it
anyway.....(Ack..an hour or more of wasted time)
So if anyone knows the name of the NPC I take the Penance bag to It would be
of great help.
