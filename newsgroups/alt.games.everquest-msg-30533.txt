While there are several pinheads who do indeed act like this, it is not
automaticly true.

Example, a few days ago myself and a couple of friends were hunting in
Mistmoore with our lowbie characters.

Enter A_Level_60_Magician_with_Epic00.

The level 60 Magician then proceeds to summon his epic weapon pet, and then
slaughters every mob in the entrance area on his way in. (level 20 - 25).
This put a major crimp in our hunting, since all of our spawns were dead for
the next 15 - 20 minutes.     The magician eventually got to the castle, got
in over his head, and trained about 15 level 35 Gargoyles / Ancilles / Deathly
Ushers / etc...  to zone.

He zoned to escape them, then meditated to full, zoned back in, summoned
another epic pet, and repeated the process, killing every newbie mob in the
area up to the castle where he once again trained his way out with his pet
dead.

He repeated this cycle for over two hours, destroying our chance at experience
by killing all of our mobs, training the zone over ten times, and killing a
few members of our group twice (yes, we were out of the way, but we had
finally managed to start fighting one of the respawns after his pass through,
and that fight aggroed the train on us.)

At this point, I'm sure as hell not going to say "Well, shit...  that sucks,
but trains happen.   Nothing he could have done about it, and I can certainly
appreciate the singlemindedness with which he pursued his own entertainment at
the expense of everyone else in the zone."
