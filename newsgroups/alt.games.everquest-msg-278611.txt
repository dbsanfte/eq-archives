Not having played EQ2, how does the mentoring work??

In CoH, here is how it works:

Sidekicking - This is used when a higher level player wants to play with 
a lower level player. The lower level player is brought up to one level 
below the higher level player. Their base damage, accuracy, resistances, 
and whatever other powers they have are brought up to that level. Their 
hitpoints are brought up to what their hitpoints would be at that level. 
They also gain experience as if they were that level.

Exemplaring - This is when a lower level player invites a higher level 
player to play down at their level. The higher level player has his level 
lowered to that of the lower player. Any powers/abilities s/he got above 
that level are no longer available. Thier HP, base damage, resistances, 
accuracy, are all brought down to the base at that level. Any bonuses 
they have remain. In addition, they work off XP debt at twice the rate, 
and once their XP debt is all completed, they make influence ($$$) at a 
pretty decent rate.
