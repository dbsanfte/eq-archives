The NPC keeps a record of whatever is handed to them up to a certain
limit, it doesn't care who by or when.  This is maintained until the
NPC despawns, is killed or the server/zone is reset.  Some quest NPCS
(like the armour giving Giants in Kael will check the faction of
anyone handing them items and 'eat' them if it's not good enough.)

This is how it is still possible to MQ (or 'chain' on some servers)
items like J-Boots, the person to hand the final item in gets the
reward.  I've been told that to clear the record of any NPC you can
hand them a stack of food or water so that any previously failed MQ
doesn't result in a horrible disaster.

The ASBOLUTE worst example I can think of this was when some
unidentified Ranger paid a HUGE amount of platinum to have his final
piece for Earthcaller (the main hand sword of the Ranger Epics) MQ-ed
for him via a guild who had a spare Shattered Emerald of Corruption
drop during their Hate raid.  Ranger and Character X (who had looted
the SEoC for MQ) proceed to the Karanas and Character X proceeds to
hand the SEoC in expecting nothing only to receive Earthcaller before
the Ranger had a chance to hand in HIS final part because some OTHER
Ranger had somehow handed in the Refined Mithril Blade portion of the
quest and left it 'stored' in the Treants loot record.  The NPC checks
this loot record, notices Character X has given him the other part and
hands the (useless to him) weapon over.

Ugh.
