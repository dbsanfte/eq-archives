After going LD Friday night I was having big problems loading and running
EQ.  Too many different problems to list here, but something was very wrong.
I finally decided to uninstall and reinstall.

Now I am having trouble reinstalling because the patch dowload keeps timing
out.  I have been trying since yesterday at around 6:00PM and can't seem to
get the thing to complete.

Is there any other way to get this patch.  If I could download with a
program like GoZilla, it would resume if I lost connection or it stalled.
Can this be done?

Please Help!

I'm starting to twitch and I think convulsions are next.
