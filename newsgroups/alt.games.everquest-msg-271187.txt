Correct me if I am wrong but the 27 hour outtage is not the only 
downtime EQ2 has had already is it? And WoW has had more than one 
episode of downtime too has it not? Not to mention the inability of 
people to get in and play when it launched.

If EQ2 has run flawlessly since lauch and been down exactly one time so 
far, even if for 27 hours, I stand corrected then. But I also expect you 
have not seen the last unexpected outtage in a game that new although I 
doubt you'll see anything so catastrophic as this again anytime soon. At 
least I hope not.

In any case, diving into version 1.0 of any software and expecting the 
kind of reliablity it will hopefully have a year and many patches later 
just isn't realistic today and that's why I prefer to play something 
else until it's all sorted out and just skip it.
