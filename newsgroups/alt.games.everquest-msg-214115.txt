It only activates when you zone into the zone housing the dungeon.  E.g we
activated our quest in NRO, but only after zoning into Oasis does it give
you info on where to go.

Hint on finding the zonein (useful if you died after completing the quest,
and need to run back for cr) - look for the almighty lag from piles of
corpses =)

51 points was for the "normal" difficulty encounter

In Sandfall Corridors, the ground traps (sand vortex) were doing 290dmg and
a stun. Annoying but not dangerous.
Mobs were gimp.

The named of sandfall was a druid, High Preservationist Dorjan. Yellow con,
max hit 819 and min 200.
Mobs DPS was at most 160, average was more like 80

Trees suck... green con indifferent trees, 1HP or so.  Kill the hollow tree
though, An angry sapling DBlue and kos spawns and agros

With a group makeup of warr(me), monk, rogue, druid, enc, bard I was taking
1.5k damage/fight average - ridiculously easy

Didn't try anything higher - my char never got moved in time.. and their
gimp templates were very offputting.  Btw how do you beta test something for
balance/playability/etc etc, when the character templates were the most
unbalanced ridiculous piles of shit I ever saw.

The monk template was nothing short of a disgrace
