any ideas on how I can fix it without completely reinstalling and
downloading the patch again?

Here's what happened. I installed the program on an external harddrive. But
when I did it I forgot to create a folder for it. I guess I thought it would
make one, but it didn't, it just installed all the files right into the
harddrive main directory. When I realized I had done this I made a folder
for it and transferred all the files into it. I knew this would screw up my
shortcut, and hoped it wouldn't mess with some of the commands within the
program, but what it did was a lot worse.

When I booted it up to see if it would work, when the patcher did the file
check it said I had a 96 hour download. DUH!   So apparently it thinks I'm
missing TONS of files and can't find any of them. Other than putting all the
files back in my main directory does anyone here know of a way I can change
the folder the patcher checks when it looks for files?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

BTW, if I can't correct this I think I will reinstall the program instead of
moving the files into the main directory. As far as any of you know are
there any potential problems with running the program on an external drive
rather than the main harddrive? If I have to reinstall the whole thing I
want to put it in the best place.

Thanks
