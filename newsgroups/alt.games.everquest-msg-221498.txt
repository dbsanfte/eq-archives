Well, at the high end there's always exodus. There aren't many high
end exp zones these days where evac isn't efficient.

I see the problem with druid healers as twofold. First, a druid
doesn't have the tools, thus he doesn't have nearly the margin for
error that a cleric does. A good druid healer has to be on top of
things on any kind of a bad pull, be willing to heal early and often.
Stand there and risk healer agro without any way to dump it and count
on the group to keep him alive. 

The second problem is you really don't know what you're getting if you
pick up a random druid for a main healer. A lot of them have solo'd
their way to higher levels and don't know the first thing about
healing. Your odds of getting someone that knows what he's doing are
just a lot higher if you go for a cleric as main healer. And even if
the cleric does turn out ot be an idiot, at least he can rez you
afterwards <g>. 

It takes a lot of skill, attentiveness and cojones to be a good
healing druid but the good ones I know, I'd trust 'em to heal pretty
much anywhere. But I'm biased in that my groups will always have a
shaman as backup healer so I can cover the major weaknesses of a druid
(especially now that I have Quiessence).
