Excellent info - ty. I knew I needed the Box of Binding, but since I hadn't
ran up to Warder Cecilia yet, I didn't realize she wouldn't give it to me.
It must look you over for the pearl. I would have Ixxy done, but not
Overking at the point I was planning. No biggie - will do Chardok after I
get another ding or two on my cleric.

thanks much.
