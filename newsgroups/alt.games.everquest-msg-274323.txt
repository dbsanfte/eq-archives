He has the right to discuss it.  Nobody said he had the right to discuss it
with *them*... but he can still discuss it in any public forum he chooses.

The other question you asked isn't directly relevant, but it's interesting
none the less.   I don't think you have the right to force someone to
communicate with you, personally.   In a way, I believe this is actually being
litigated currently.  When the law providing for the national "Do Not Call"
list went into effect for telemarketers, one of their arguments was that it
was violating their right to free speech by forbidding them to call and
initiate that speech.  I'm not sure I've heard if a decision was made on that
part of the argument.
