ugh i remember you now... youre that annoying guy with the stupid sig.
Why are you always bashing biz? hes just... biz..... without him, this
newsgroup would be like.... boring. youre like an immature jr high kids that
always posts bullshit. you think you can really change what a couple hundred
people think about someone by posting about some song and a webaddress? Give
it up, youre just making people want to wreck your comp sooner. Oh and for
the record, that was not a threat.
