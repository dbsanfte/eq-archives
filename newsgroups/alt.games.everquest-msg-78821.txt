Along with all the other good suggestions here, go to the
Option screen (prior to the actual login screen) and turn
Texture Caching to "on".

This will dramatically speed up the amount of time
it takes the game to go from server-select to character-select.
Actually, the *first* time into the game after you set
this option won't be any faster, because it's building
and saving the cache files.  But all subsequent entries
into the game will be noticeably faster.

Now the bad news: This will eat up 100MB+ of your hard
drive.  If you're short on hard drive space, don't do it.
But otherwise, enjoy.

As for Iceclad in particular, the previously mentioned
"UseUmbra=FALSE" made *ALL* the difference for everyone
in my guild.  Zoning into Iceclad was taking several
*minutes*, long enough that we thought we had locked up.
After setting UseUmbra=FALSE, zoning into Iceclad is
just as good as it used to be pre-Luclin.
