Good Luck :(

I tried all local Game and EB Stores (if there's a point to that,
looks like they're the same company anyway, either that or they don't
mind their web sites looking almost identical!), tried online at EB,
Game, Software first, Amazon.

I'd go with mail order if I were you, and get it shipped from the US.
An in game friend went out on New Years Day (/boggle?) and bought me a
copy of Trilogy, as I only need the account number (for 2nd account).
Of course, I wanted the second account to be able to stop Rez timer
counting down on raids, and from the rumours (and ONLY rumour so far),
it looks like it's going to be a fixed 3 hours, regardless if you're
online or not. *sigh*
