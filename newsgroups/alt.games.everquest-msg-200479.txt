By all over that little area, do you mean the top of the pyramid? We
didn't really spend a lot of time up there, we'd had a group camping
4c and decided to head up after a few other friends showed up. Only
cleared the top like twice though before we had to leave. 

Your experience pretty much matches mine, although a lvl 65 bard would
do nicely for crowd control, I think. At least we had one mezzing and
charming sebilis jugs the other day on a 4 person Jumpy run. Those are
up to 58 so I assume she could also do the brown lizards. 

Rgds, Frank
