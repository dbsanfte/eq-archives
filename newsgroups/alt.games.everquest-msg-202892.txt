It always amazes me when people who are clueless to the development
process and the complexity of maintaining a complex farm of servers
can proclaim how "stupid" SOE programmers can be. If the bug you say
exists, yes - its a stupid bug, but the programmers arent stupid. If
they were, we wouldnt be here playing this game for so long.
