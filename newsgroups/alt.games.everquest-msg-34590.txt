too funny...

the fucking noob dishing out advice and ranking flames...until you can
actually come up with something other than changing a couple of consonents
to make a flame then you need to STFU junior...nice name btw...I see the
name generator slapped you with a real whopper, or did you just manage to
bash your keyboard a few times with those fat stubs you call fingers?

School yard insults...ROFL...pretty ironic coming from the people who's sole
response to everything is to call everyone a child while they stamp their
feet like a bunch of whining little girls...

please ryouseika...enlighten me with what a REAL flame would be...give me
your best shot...I soooo look forward to you gracing me with your
intelligent wit.

you're reminiscent of a schoolyard bully...only you're not the
bully...you're the little annoying sidekick dim bulb that can't keep his fat
face shut and can do nothing but repeat what the bully says like a badly
trained parrot...
