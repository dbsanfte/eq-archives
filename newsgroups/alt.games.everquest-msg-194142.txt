Well, went for the slow, black lizard that my funds would allow.
Definitely slow, hop is kinda goofy looking.  But man it looks cool =)
and the no sitting to med is a Godsend.  All in all, I love it, went
farming forest giants, drovs, frogloks in FV afterwards and the regen
of hp and mana was very noticable.  Not sure about the agro range
factor, might just be in my head, but it did seem to help.  Combat
takes a little getting used to, but all in all, I'm happy so far with
my expensive new toy.  Thanks for all the advice guys, much
appreciated.
