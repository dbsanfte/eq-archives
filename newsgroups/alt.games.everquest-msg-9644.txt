You can get your faction back, try a yahoo search on everquest.
EverQuest is a role playing game so, don't do anything unless you have a
good reason to do it, if, you're going to be concerned about faction.

As far as the frogs go, kill 'em all.

 I've killed about 10 DE Guards, Lady Shea about 20
 Times, and last night I learned that you don't kill the Frogs in the swamp,
or what else, "You Lose faction"

Is this just a Shadow Knight Thing, and can I ever regain my faction?
