I would have stayed and argued and even gotten a GM involved should it
have gone that distance. I have done that a lot back in the days when
OSI had a concern over customer relations in Ultima Online. That's why
I left that game cause the management let it go to crap and let the
little dweebe teenagers take over.

That's why I went off the deep end. I don;t want to have to deal with
that here too.
