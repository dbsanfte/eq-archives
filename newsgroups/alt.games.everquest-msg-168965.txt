 Regardless, I'd say healing aggro was a bit much in PoP. For single XP
groups it was probably in line with the Risk. But for larger raids where
you need to keep fairly beefy heals on your MT is was a bit excessive.
If someone went LD and missed a heal or something and the MT died, in
about 90% of those cases you'd probably end up losing half of your
clerics in the next 5 seconds because of how high on the list they were
from healing the MT.
