LOL! How can you not take offense of being called a complete moron?

If someone decides they want to pay the extra for that service it's upto
them. If someone can afford to spend that cash on EQ then why shouldn't if
they're going to get enjoyment out of it...people waste their money on all
sorts of things, hell you should see the money I used to spend on mice (the
PC input device not the furry kind) reading about the legends package it
does sound quite good but not enough for me to want to pay $80/mnth instead
of $20
