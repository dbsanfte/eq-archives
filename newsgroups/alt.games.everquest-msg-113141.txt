The only one making assumptions was you - you assumed you would be
called names before it happened, and so you lashed out. Hence the "a
priori". That your prediction was self-fulfilling was no one's fault
but your own.

Your problem isn't your lack of gear, or people inspecting you. Your
problem *is you*. So no, I don't have this problem.

You can leave, or kill file me, any time you like.

wishing ill on others. You weren't on the receiving end of a joke, but
you're rapidly *becoming* one.
