Well I said I was snippy, but after all, you are a top poster and so can't
expect much in the way of respect.

There are a good many camps in Fungus other than shrooms.  I'll grant you that a
51 monk is only going to break a shroom patch via sheer luck.

If its shrooms you want, then a good plan would be to get a level 60+ buddy to
come break the camp.  I can easily single pull shrooms just by tapping one on
the shoulder, bring them over for you to kill... space them out, and if you can
kill them fast enough, then you never have to split them again.  Take about 3
minutes light effort on the part of the level 60.

You buy the log in, change the credit card number on the account, and try not to
let Sony find out... which doesn't seem to be an issue, other than lip service.

You are very vulnerable on both sides of the equation; selling, you expose
yourself to the possibility that the buyer will manage to get the account put
back on your card.  Get around that via a game card instead of using credit
cards, I suppose.  As a buyer, you have the risk that the seller is lying about
the account, or will do funny things with your credit card number (after all, he
is a criminal, can you trust him?  I guess Paypal would help) or will get the
account back after you've paid for it... and that perhaps Sony cares more than
Verant did, and will cancel the account for you.

On the other hand, "Ebay" is more than an accusation, its a generic insult,
meaning that you seem to know very little about your character, whether you
really did buy it on the web or not.  Its like "AOLer"
