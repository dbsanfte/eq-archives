I agree completly.
I recently joined EQ and I work in a proffesional enviroment.  So I sought
help from those in guilds who were high levelers. Most people dont even
respond never mind give any help.
I have however found a few people who will willing drop armour to a newbie
(like me) and cast a good heel when your about die or offer advice on the
general controls and skills - dont get me wrong they dont play the game for
me just help me along a little - which to me makes the game that little bit
better.
I know little of guilds or where to go to join one as this is my first ever
game like this - I would like to see a guild that actually spends time in
helping others than themselves - I must be honest here that other players
give better advice than most GMs (no offence to them intended)
Consideration for others around you is just good manors, not just in your
guild or group remember others that are in the same zone. We all pay to play
no one deserves any abuse for making a mistake I recieved many when in an
early level group even when I told them I was new, if someone has a problem
they should discuss this sensibly even if they wish a person to leave a
group or guild there are ways and means to this unfortunatly i think that
only the more proffesional people would work this one out.

Now I have ranted I will leave!
