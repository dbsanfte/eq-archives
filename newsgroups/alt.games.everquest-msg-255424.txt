Yes! It's a fabulously fun quest!

Oh.  You mean is the -reward- worth it.

Nah.  Unless we end up needing it for epic ][ in OoW.

There's one at eq.crgaming.com/epics, I think.

>Can any of it be soloed?

Yes, about half of it can be soloed.  Most of the soloable bits are the 
most fun, too.

You can probably do 90% or more of it with those forces... Trying to think 
what the exception would be... Ah. You might need a rogue for city of mist 
part, but there's a key that drops for that door now, I think.

Purchaseable?  Nah.  The best epic replacement would be that staff from 
HoH Alekson Garn trial, or the one off manaetic prototypes in PoI.  
Grandmaster Jeweler's Eyeglass sounds out of your budget, but is 
worthwhile.  For a straight-up purchase, though, I'd go with good ol' 
stein of moggok and opal-encrusted stein.
