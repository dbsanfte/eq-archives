I wouldn't think that placing the same message in the newsgroup a few
times over the course of a week would be considered Spam, maybe if it
was cross posted. 

I see all of their advertised prices are in plat so I wonder what you
think the violation of their contract is ?

I also wonder how you could know what their contract with VI is and
why that would be of any concern to you. Are you an employee of VI ? 

When did violating a company's ELUA become a criminal act ?

I also noted that someone posted that they might of violated the
charter for this newsgroup. For my own curiosity where is this charter
located ? How often is it posted to the newsgroup ?

Again, I am not siding with them, but rather playing a bit of a devils
advocate.
