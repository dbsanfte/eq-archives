Hey thanks for all the unhelpful posts. Once upon a time, usenet was a
community filled with helpful people. I guess expansion of the
internet hasn't been a improvement in all respects.

As for the RTFM comments, give me a break. The EQ manuals are all very
high-level story-fluff and this is EQ -- just because it is in the
manual doesn't mean that it is implemented or working. Nor do the
4-page manuals say much of anything about quests.
