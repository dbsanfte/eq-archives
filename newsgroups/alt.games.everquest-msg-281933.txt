Which is why I specified GIMP instead of PC Paintbrush :) I don't
believe PC Paintbrush had alpha, multiple layer, or history support.
Could be wrong, but I don't remember it having those. Haven't used it

That's why .ext was a bad idea. Too easy to have duplicates.

Xiphos - I'll check my email tonight and send off the file to those
interested. Sorry for the delay, last night was a little hectic.
