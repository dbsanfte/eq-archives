Currently I'm making it for myself.  Insufficient cash to make it for
others.  Once I've rebuilt my cash base some, I'll probably start
making it to order.  I'm not sure how much I'll be charging for it,
but the lesser stuff (enchanted or imbued, not both) goes for multiple
thousands.  And I *still* won't pay 100 Plat for a leather padding.

A joke:  There are some people who I know want the armour, but will
have to find it from someone else; I'm not gonna make it for them.
There's a few other Dwarven cultural smiths out there who can make it
for them.
