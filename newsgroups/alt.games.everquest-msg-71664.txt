Oh, I didn't do that one. And I didn't think of more EQ spells. (I
also didn't get to toss dwarves last night, since I couldn't connect
to *anything* across the Atlantic. Feh.)

However, I sat there comparing a lot of things to EQ. I wanted the
clothes, thought about differences and similarities between Tolkien's
light, dark, grey and wood elves and assorted EQ elves, half elves
(Spoiler: Elrond's a half elf), how EQ's high and wood elves are like
Tolkien's grey elves split in two directions - notice how Rivendell
and Lothlorien blend marble finery with nature?
I also sat there listening for words I recognized in the Elven phrases
(Yes, I am such a fangirl. I can even see the different influences of
the two Tolkien artists who were used as conceptual designers),
reflecting on wizard melee :) and the different schools of magic
(Tolkien wizards have absolutely nothing to do with EQ wizards) and
different beings of power (Maiar, mostly, since Valar aren't in this
film) and how I'd love having a game like "EQ as in Middle-Earth
instead of Norrath - especially with those clothes" and junk.
