This morning I logged on early thinking to work on my twink necro a bit
but quickly got asked if I would be willing to go with my new guild and
go help one of our Druids get her Seb key. I said sure, logged on my
Troll champion and off we went. We quickly had a key (nobody much
hunting in TT) and the group leader suggested we break in her new key
with a trip into Seb. We only had a few hours since we had committed to
helping kill a few epic quest mobs later on, but we gave it a shot.

We got into Seb and found to our amazement that it was almost empty.
Disco was the only thing camped. Only six of us, so we thought we would
try guards. Made our way down there, clearing the path and set up camp
and started pulling.  I'll tell ya, I don't think I've seen my warrior's
xp bar move past that first yellow I got in two months. But today, in
only a couple hours, I got half a yellow. That would have been good
enough by itself, but the loot fell amazingly as well. 

I myself got all three of the Warrior Epic Quest gems, and in an
unbelievable stroke, we got the necro scarab and I won the roll on the
CSS. (serious upgrade, some say superior to Lammy. I need to run it
through Copelands tonight though, to see if I should equip that or my
Kunjar in the primary slot.)  In addition, other folks got nice stuff
too. Couple more diamonds fell, along with various "trash gems" (rubies
and such which were all just given to the cleric.) But FOUR BLUE
DIAMONDS dropped in that short time as well. All dropped off of scarabs.
Couple other pieces of twink armor too. No deaths and the xp was
outstanding.

I guess there's no point to this post. It was just a very good morning
and the first time I've really gotten excited about playing Jakugg in a
long time.
