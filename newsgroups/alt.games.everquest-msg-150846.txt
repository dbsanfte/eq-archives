I was partnering with a rogue in Nurga once.  Things got out of hand, I
managed to mez 2 mobs, have one as a pet and heal him up enough so that we
could take them out at our own pace.  Never listen to what anyone says on
how to play a bard, unless it's another bard.

The bane of any bard's existance, three words, and I hate them:  "Play Mana
Song."

"I am you numnut, there isn't an icon for it, and I am twisting it with
catana which has the icon of a heart.  So, shut up, sit down and med before
I decide to grab every mob I can and train them on ya to shut you up
myself."
