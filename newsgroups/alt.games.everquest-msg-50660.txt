Here's a list of things that do exist:
1) Places where a group of 6 can go for good exp and fun all the way to
level 60
2) Places where large guilds can go for organised raids and face the baddest
of bad mobs for the best items.
3) Easy, safe, convenient zones for pickup groups all the way to 60.

Here are things that don't exist:
1) Places where soloers can get the best items in the game
2) Places where pickup groups can hunt for the best items in the game
3) Giant, impressive, scarey monsters that few people will ever see yet can
be hunted by single groups.

The game never requires you to join a guild unless you really want to raid.
If you don't want to raid you can get to 60 and have all the fun you want
along the way, but you will never be as well-dressed as members of a raiding
guild.
Now, there _may_ (MAY) be a disproportionate amount of raid content in SoV
but there will be less in SoL. As is said elsewhere though, a lot of this
'Raid Content' is not exclusively for raid sized groups e.g there are
raid-level mobs in many many zones yet the rest of the zone is for single
groups. This applies from Permafrost to Dragon Necropolis. The number of
'stricly raid only no groups viable here' zones is in single figures even
counting the old Planes. And why complain about the amount of high level
content anyway, when sooner or later everyone gets to 60 and needs to find
something to do. . .

This isn't a specific rant at anyone, just some observations :)
