Nowadays in HHK you need to hold both WR and RR camps to get good
consistent action. I just levelled up a froglok cleric alt from 25 to
34 in HHK and most of people in zone were alts with good gear, so
those mobs went down fast.
In one group we pulled everything from stair down as fast as they
spawned, and that meant exp was steady and really , really good.
