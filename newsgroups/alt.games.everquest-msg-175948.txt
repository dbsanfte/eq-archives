One of the problems I am having with a new Dark Elf is that I can get
to level 4 or 5 rather quickly but because of the racial faction I
find it next to impossible to get any decent loot by level 5.

Now, I assume that I am doing something wrong but can anyone enlighten
me?   I basically need 1.5 plat to get a trader's sack and then I
reckon that I can trade some stuff to make my time worthwhile.

However, I need to get that 1.5 plat first.  Any obvious suggestions
which I have missed?
