3. Although admittedly not as well as a Monk. As for rangers, you're  crazed
if you think they cant solo. Snare, Fear, SoW and Heal spells make them very 
very capable soloers where animals are around.

Now, don't get me wrong - I'm not saying Monks suck, Rangers gods, but
you seriously underestimate the utility of the other classes if you think
Monks outclass warriors rogues and the others by as much as your post implies.


Of course, Not having to deal with that pesky Actual-Death skill like the
rest of us is nice ;)
