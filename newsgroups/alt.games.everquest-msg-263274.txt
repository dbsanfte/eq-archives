OK, good to know.

But its a slap in the face to everyone in the other thread who are 
saying that people wondering if invis breaks charm aren't able to read 
the word Summoned.  Since it -does- work on Reanimated pets, its clear 
that they don't always mean exactly what they say, after all.

Seems to me they've done this one right, if they wanted a mild boost to 
the power of pet summoners without screwing up charmers.
