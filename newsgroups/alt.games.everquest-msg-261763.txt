I was hunting the guard in felwithe just before the release of OoW.
Now I can't attack those guards.  And even though they con "ready to
attack" they won't attack me!  I've tried two different servers and
two different accounts on two different computers and the results are
the same.  On 21-Sep I happened to witness another player that had the
same problem.  I realize that not everyone would want to attack those
guards but for mid-50's  they are easy to pull, not too difficult and
drop a decent vender sale item.  Their spawn rate ain't too bad and
the zone is at hand.  In short a very nice hunting spot.  Then they
broke it.
So has anyone else had this problem?  Does anyone not have this
problem?
