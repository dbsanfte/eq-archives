Well, as a Druid (and all casters follow many of the same rules, I've 
noticed) I find that running party support is a better contribution to 
these fights. I heal, buff, and DS, none of which have any bearing on the 
mobs resist rate but will certainly contribute to its death and the 
continued existence of my party. Once you've helped your allies all you can 
with things like *digs around on eq.castersrealm.com to find a wizard spell 
list* well, damage shields, meditate so you can chain cast burn until one 
gets through if things go badly or be rested and ready for the next pull if 
things go well. Meleeing is not a bad thing, if you are at decent mana 
levels and have already DSed your tanks. You aren't likely to draw much 
aggro, and those wimpy magician hits may just help a bit, when and if they 
land. My druid occasionally steps in to relieve a tank that is faltering 
for a bit, but then again I get better armor than the INT casters...
