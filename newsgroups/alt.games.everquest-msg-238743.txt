Actually levi can get you down there. I fell in with my druid due to lag, 
but I had levi on. I found myself suspended over the gaping maw of the hole 
before going "Oh no" and zoning in. It was actually rather Wile E. Coyote-
esque. 

The funny thing is that my (then 30) druid *survived the fall*, I can only 
assume because he was not "falling" when he hit the hole. I hit ground, 
lost 3/4 of my life, and had about 5 seconds to say "Oh my god, I 
*survived*? before the hounds of hell were upon me.

That CR was accomplished by a guildies hole-drag mule(the de facto halfling 
cleric- since nerfed :( ) but I did petition and got a tell from a GM 
within half an hour. By that time the rogue was dragging for me, so the gm 
took off. This was on Drinal, about 2 years ago.

Another option is to find a friendly monk to drag your corpse and a 
friendly party to hold the drop-down area for you. The monk can drag the 
corpse to the wall, and you can drag it up the wall, loot it, and then all 
get GGed out.
