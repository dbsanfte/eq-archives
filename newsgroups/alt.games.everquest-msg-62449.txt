Well, if he visit each page and print out the map, he will see some 
banner adds, and this way help to make the site survive. The banner adds 
DO give more than what it cost in bandwidth to download that map.

If you could download all the maps in one complete file without seeig 
any banner adds, you will cost them money in bandwith that are not being 
covered by banner adds, thereby increasing the .com problem, and maybe 
even cause the page to be closed.
