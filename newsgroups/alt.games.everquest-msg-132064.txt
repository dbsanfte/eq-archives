Well I think that was the point I was trying to make.  It seems pretty
clear that there is some fixed amount of "hate" acquired for scoring a
hit at all as well as the "hate" that is in proportion to the damage
done.  Thus, dual wielded fast weapons will get/hold agro better than
a big slow 2hander that actually puts out more damage.

Also, I prefer the Jagged Blade of Mourning to the Centi (unless your
stats are so low that you need the str/sta from the Centi to get over
100), only a marginally better ratio (13/25 vs. 14/27), but it <is>
faster and I'd usually rather have 10mr/3ac (also 10dex?) than the
str/sta from the Centi.

Yeah, I need to pick one up for my warrior.  I don't have access to the
armor that the really silly twinks wear (I mean c'mon, Royal Velium on
a L20?  That's better gear than my L52 main wears) but at least I can
get his damage output up.
