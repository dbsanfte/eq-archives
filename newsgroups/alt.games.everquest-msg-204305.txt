Hi,

I have a lvl 55 necro and one yellow from 56. But where is a good place to
solo for xp? I tried BW what is easy to do but the xp isn't good there
anymore. Tried also the Grey but the problem is that i can't pull single
there so a lot of adds. Also Skyfire is hard because the many adds and the
debuffing mobs.

Any suggestions where it is good to solo?

Played also in PoN/PoJ for xp and that is very good there but as necro hard
to get a group ;-)

Thanks,

Nico
