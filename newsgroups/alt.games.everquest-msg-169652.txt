Somebody's probably used it.  Smells kinda like hubris though.  Perhaps if 
there's ever a liberal party again, they can use it.

Eh, we can apply terms wherever we want.  There's nothing all that new 
about there being change and a way things are.

Of course they are.

caught him saying something that could be interpreted as vaguely offensive 
to someone, and then blow it all out of proportion.
