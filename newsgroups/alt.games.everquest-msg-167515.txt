I posted this once before, but in a different thread that wasn't so
clearly marked.

http://pub75.ezboard.com/bagetestgroup

    We do have a yahoo newsletter set up as well, but the darned thing
is filling my mailbox, so I am promoting this.  For those that don't
know, a couple of weeks ago Jekke suggested that we some of us get
together and form a hunting group on Test Server.  This idea caught on
fire, and now many of us are in a mad dash to level up to the point
where we can hunt together.  The main idea is to set aside one day of
the week (Monday) and hunt together, preferably in a dungeon.  We want
to start when we are about 10-12 level, hopefully this coming Monday. 
We already have more than 1 full group, and are getting to the point
where we might have more than 2 (but I don't think that all the new
comers will be ready for the first hunt this coming Monday).
  
   Most of us have stated that we would like to form a guild, and we
certainly have enough bodies to do so now. We have not seriously
discussed a name, though I have asked for ideas, or decided on the guild
leader, officers, or charter.  Nor have we discussed if anyone from AGE
can join, or if there is anyone we would exclude if they asked to join. 
I have seen all of every class online except for bard, ranger, and
shaman, though Jekke says he can box a shaman, and I have a level 10 one
that I started before this project got underway.  Several people have
said that they are not sure that they will keep the characters they have
started.

Oh, and I will be fiddling with the EZboard colors later.  It's kinda
bland looking now.
