This is the only comic I read online.  This link is to yesterday's.  Read 
it and hit the "next" to read today's.

The comic's premise is a bunch of people that work at a gaming magazine 
company.  Several of them play EQ, so there are random EQ references in 
here and there.  Today's was pretty good.  The troll ( may not be in those 
2 comics ) is from UO, I believe.
