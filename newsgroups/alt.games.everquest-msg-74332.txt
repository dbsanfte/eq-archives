Hi all.

First off, let me say that I have seen some very obvious things done in 
the past to not only attempt to kill mass numbers of n00bEs (I try where 
and when I can to ward them away), but have also seen some do some very 
idiotic things.  Now I will grant you, if Verant decided to yank every 
account owned by 16-18 y/o's and forced people to go thru (a more 
complete and better prepared version of) the tutorial, some of these 
things wouldn't happen.  As it stands though... *sigh*  if they were to 
do that they'd probably loose a large share of their money base, 
nevermind the fact they'd be upholding their own rules.

Now I will grant you, naeive n00bEs, wandering around, looking for 
helpful people who know what the frell they're doing is a fact of life 
on EQ that isn't likely to go away soon, but some of these people need 
to learn to engauge the brains faster then the greed.  Case in point:

About three days ago, someone in WFP was offering twinked out armor and 
weapons to the first n00bE to meet him in the arena.  Now, granted, the 
typical n00bE wouldn't know that arenas are scarey places for n00bEs to 
be, but to everyone else in the zone, this was such a blatent attempt at 
offing n00bEs that he got called on it almost immediately by several, 
more seasoned players.  The loud protests that ensued were eventually 
squelched (by a GM?  I dunno).

Having been there myself, I can say that there are things, like 
_PATIENCE_, that can be learned in the early levels.  Unfortunately, 
most only see the piles of platinum waiting and begin down the dark 
path...  Once you start down the dark path, forever will in dominate 
your destin...  err...  Sorry.  I have this odd habit of channeling Yoda 
every now and then.

To those reading this of higher levels who delight in carnage (I count 
myself in this crowd, BTW), n00bEs aren't worth the time and effort it 
takes to trick and/or kill.  Instead, (and for a taste of your own 
medicine) I suggest you go find and wake the sleeper.  The rest of us, 
who are busy leveling ourselves and others who want/need the help, can 
be found happily ignoring those of you who think tourmenting others is fun.

One final rant, people, use /auction for auctions, /shout for shouts, 
and /ooc for out of character chat.  Some of us do visit EC for things 
other then ports, steins, armor of Wu, etc. and it is very annoying to 
have my hunting /tells interrupted by someone who doesn't have the 
courtesy to use the approiate channels.

*climbs down off the soap box.*
