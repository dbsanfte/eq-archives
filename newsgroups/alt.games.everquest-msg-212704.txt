Greetings all.

I saw a map with the hidden tunnels in Dulak and thought i'd go scope it
out.  I invised and went up the rock ramp...and fell into a net or
something.  I couldn't move.  I tried jumping, i tried ducking; all to no
avail.  I finally had to gate with the mobs trying to tan my hide.

Is this the only way to get to hidden area?  Will levitate work?  What am I
doing wrong?

Thanks,
Dea
