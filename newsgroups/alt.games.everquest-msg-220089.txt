Read it again, I didn't say it was a spinoff of DS9.  I said it
was an attempt to ride on the coattails of DS9... and there was
plenty of hype and speculation out about DS9 by the time B5 was
released, not all that long before DS9  (weeks, not seasons)

As I say elsewhere in the thread, I don't think there's any real
chance that either series was actually developed based on the
concept of the other series, they must have taken longer to
produce than that.

But the people who were making the commercials for B5... I think
they saw a clear opportunity to steal the thunder of the latter,
since they -also- had a SF space opera centered around a station
in a conflicted area.  There were a lot of dedicated ST franchise
customers out there hot for the idea by that point, and by
pushing the similarity and pushing their release date up they
figured to kidnap some of those.

Its a lot like when they released three Columbus movies in one
year, or El Dorado and The Emporer's New Groove or Antz and a
Bug's Life; for some reason several different people develop
projects that are new and different but resemble each other at
least superficially and release them at the same time.  B5 and
DS9, twin sons of different mothers?
