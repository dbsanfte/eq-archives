As someone that was in your shoes about 3 weeks ago, I'll offer the 
following:

1) Take the time to go through the tutorial. Visit every NPC in the 
tutorial and read what they tell you. Do NOT just jump straight into the 
game. It will make all the difference in the world.

2) If you're using the 30 day trial offer, DO NOT judge the game on the 
graphics. Find my thread "OK...WOW" for a screenshot comparison of my 
paladin in the 30-day trial vs. the full game.

3) Pick a class and read, read, read. Tons of sites, tons of resources.

4) once logged in, take the time to talk to your guild masters and do 
the quests they office. Interacting with the NPC is hit or miss 
sometimes, be patient and just figure it out. It is easy to get frustrated.

5) Take the game for what it is. A 5 year old MMORPG that has been 
updated as best it can be. It isn't as "slick" as the new MMORPGs but it 
is fun, it has TONS of content and it can recreate that "newness" 
feeling you first got when you logged into your first MMORPG if you let it.

I've been playing for almost a month now and have loved every minute of 
it. Just take your time and enjoy the ride.

As to your starting server, if you're on the 30-day trial, then you only 
have 2 to choose from. Just pick one, doesn't matter. If you're not on 
the trial and have the full game, try Stromm, it is a "newbie" server.

Oh, and asking questions here is always good too. I made extensive use 
of this group and got great info. :D
