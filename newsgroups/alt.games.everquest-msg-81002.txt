Hey, you *know* how fast I level when I put my mind to it. If we decide
to put any serious time into playing these characters, watch out!

Yes indeedy do. And that's the plan for both of us. However, I'm doing
my "recreate your n00b days only with fifty-some levels of knowledge
behind you" experiment..... so I'm running on an extrememly tight budget
and I'm going to get the spells that will keep us alive and leveling
first, and then get the other skill maxers second. All things in good
time. I still haven't figured out what have these fucking spells are
for! And some seem useless at low levels on bats and bugs and kobold
runts.

Bah, don't waste leveling time on it. (I know your blue bar took kind of
a beating in VP.) Talking in tells is fun enough, and frankly we're
pretty boring right now. Until I at least hit sixteen and get breeze and
a decent mezz I think I'm about as interesting and useful as tits on a
boar hog.

Besides..... I'd be embarassed to have you see me until I make some
proper armor. (Next goal........ sewing kit! Raw silk armor, here I
come! WOO HOO!)
