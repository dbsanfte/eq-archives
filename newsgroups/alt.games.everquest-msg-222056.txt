Crystalline Silk Threads are dropped by spiders in Velks, they are 
nodrop, and they are used for the shawl.

Two spiderling silks combined in a kit do yield a thread, which has 
absolutely nothing to do with what we are talking about here.  Two 
Crystalline Silks, dropped by various spiders in CC, Thurgadin mines, and 
Velks, are combined to make a Crystalline Silk Swatch.  Again, this has 
nothing to do with what we are talking about however.

Back to the No Drop Threads...

They drop off spiders in Velks, you combine five of them to make one 
Crystalline Silk Fiber, you then combine three of those fibers with one 
shardwurm bile to make the Glowing Crystalline Silk, five of the Glowing 
Crystalline Silk are then combined with your shawl 4 to make shawl 5.

I hope that clears up the confusion you seem to have about the subject.
