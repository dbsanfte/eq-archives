Yeah, I'll put in my vote for Rathe Mountains, SK or LIO...places where
dying doesn't mean 8 hours of lost xp and running back to your corpse is
annoying.

What's important to remember is if level 49 clerics have been known to hunt
in that zone there's much less chance someone will be willing to pay for a
relatively crappy rez unless they're desperate.
