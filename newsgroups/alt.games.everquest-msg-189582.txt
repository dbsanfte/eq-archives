I'll shoot you an e-mail.

Did you finish your clicker the other night after Rage fell?  Gratz, and 
thanks for the invite to the battle.  We went to EK to do the Corrupted for 
a guildmate ranger ( who had previously failed on that battle ) after Rage 
died, but the Corrupted despawned when it was about 20 health.  Very odd 
and annoying.
