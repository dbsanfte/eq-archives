Others answered it.  Just bored at work so I'll add this:  please remember
the DoT in your snare for when you're grouped with enchanters.  Druid,
ranger, wizard, bard (original) snare are fine to cast on mezzed critters.
Yours is horrible.

Of course, if you're not grouped with a mezzer, yours is very good. :)
