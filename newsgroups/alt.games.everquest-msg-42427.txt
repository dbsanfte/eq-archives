Well seeming you are a gnome you are in Steamfont, and IMHO Steamfont is one
of the best "newbie" zones in the game. You can happily stay here to level
12 or so... Firstly kill low level wildlife, then move onto Kobolds, and
then onto skeletons / elementals / harpys that spawn around the Mino Caves /
Cogs.
