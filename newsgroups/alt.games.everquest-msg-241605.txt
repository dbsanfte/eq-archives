Normally typing /log on will turn on logging for that session. I am
not sure if you have the in-game Journal turned on either, and can't
remember how to access it - ask around in-game for advice on the
journal.

Yes, you have found the correct quest giver - each of the armour
pieces have a "pattern" and require some ingredients to be combined in
that "kit" - the first ones in the list require the most common
ingredients, the ones like chest and legs are the hardest to locate.

Write it down and off you go.
