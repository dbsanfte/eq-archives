Though the free character transfer offer has concluded, those who still wish
to move to any of these three European servers may do so through our
standard transfer service. This service is similar to our traditional
Character Transfer Service, except in three ways:

     1. All characters from a single server only on your account are moved
to the new server.
     2. You keep all items and coins possessed.
     3. The Sullon Zek server, Test Server and Firiona Vie server are
excluded from this character transfer service.

The fee for transfer of all characters on a single account from a single
server only to a European server through this service is $50.
