Well all I can attest to is what I've seen, and in three trips to
Tunare with Legions of Valhalla, noone has so much as suggested using
this plan, nor has there been any substantial trouble with the "hide
the healers" plan; thats 6 silencer mob kills, two as my cleric, four
as my bard.

Further, as I mentioned, many months back I did that WW silencer
dragon, similarly using the "hide the cleric plan"

Surely if this plan was being used, I'd have been informed of it as
either a cleric (prime recipient of the silence removal) or bard (one
of two present, and given more than one group, surely they'd have
needed me to sing to one)

Not that it doesn't sond like a good plan, but its news to us.
