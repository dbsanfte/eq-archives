20 seconds.  If all you are after is frogs in OS, then you would not be 
training anyone, and would be easily close enough to the zone out to be 
able to reach it.

It has been some time since I've soloed around the entry/exit area in OS, 
but, as I recall, if you take care, you can limit adds by pulling back 
towards the zone in area.  You should get 2 at most at any time.  
Personally, I'd root the warriors, and stun and kill the casters first.  
Another thing to consider, stun is fairly effective against runners as 
well.  Don't recall off hand how many stuns paladins get, but you should 
be able to come close to stun locking a mob when it is running.
