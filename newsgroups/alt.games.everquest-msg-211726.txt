Embarased?  Steel warriors has not been updated in quite some time.  I used
to not beleive that taunting adds agro but explain to me how the following
holds up to your ill-informed statement.  If a mob has been mezzed by an
Enchanter or Bard and I just smack the mob, to awake it, it goes straight
for the mezzer.  A bard friend of mine suggested taunting the mezzed mob a
couple times before waking them up.  He explained that this would help me
get them off of him quicker or possibly prevent them from even turning
towards him.  I began trying this and I had great success.  I face the mob
that is mezzed.  Taunt, alow taunt to become available again, Taunt and if I
have the time, do one more taunt.  Then when I wake the mob up it usually
never goes after the mezzer.  Try going to KC.  In RCY there is a spot where
you can taunt mobs through the wall.  In the corner you can taunt the
decayed line of skeletons and the occasional Jailer.  Against the far right
wall you can taunt the Cursed Hand through the wall.  I just stand near the
spot and hit taunt.  Sometimes it takes 3-4 trys and others 1 is enough.  I
can pull the mob through the wall just with taunt.  So Taunt does add agro.

So, do not rely on an outdated website like steel warriors and keep your
misinformed comments to yourself.
