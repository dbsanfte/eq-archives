Well, the undead in OT con indifferent when I am on the boat, I checked that
once a long time ago, and thought, wow, I've killed enough Sarnaks finally,
got off the boat, died.  So, it is not just a hide or invis that the boat
simulates, it appears to change the con on everything to indifferent,
possibly even things that con better, not sure, haven't tested that.
