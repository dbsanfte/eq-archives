Not necessarily, no.

After *1 week* I've forgotten how to use a sword and lost 2 levels?

That would be a problem with the *rate of decay*.

I haven't spoke french daily in 20 years. Guess what... I don't speak it 
very well anymore. Its not 'gone'; it never will be completely gone and 
I'd learn it much faster the 2nd time around, but it has decayed 
significantly. And note that it took 20 years...  I didn't lose my 
ability to speak french over the Christmas  break. You seem to think the 
only way for decay to work is extremely and unrealistically quickly.

Again *rate of decay* issue.

/shrug 

As usual sony fixed a problem of degree with a solution of elimination. 
They've set that precedent a hundred times over in EQ1.
