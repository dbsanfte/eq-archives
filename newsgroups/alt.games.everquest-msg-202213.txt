Isn't this barse ackwards ?

Isn't AC a representation of how good your DMittigation and DAvoidance are  
?

Isn't it the case that things like :

Defence, dodge skill, parry etc. add to DamAvoid and thus AC
While things like Armour add to DMittigation and thus AC ?

I was under the impression that there are 2 numbers lurking under the hood 
of EQ, but that "AC" was the representation of the sum of these numbers 
shown to we poor users.
