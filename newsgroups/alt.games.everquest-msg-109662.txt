Sort of sounds like us, except that we tend to manage without invites.
The reason having to deal with more than one at a time is dangerous
has quite a bit to do with the fact that we're sometimes as few as 20,
and on my first trip there, there was a point where we were only 18.
It works for us because we have great raid leaders and usually listen
to them. (In the two nights since eating that death, I've regained
more than the lost exp and also helped kill Sev and VS, so my only
grumble is that VS didn't drop druid pants :) )
