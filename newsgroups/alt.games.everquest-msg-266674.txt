Just curious, using this post/thread as a baseline, how is crafting at
retail?  I started a thread about it, wanting information on it. So far I
have found it difficult to get into in game without going out on the web and
doing homework.

Incidentally, that has also been my take on the class system.  It works fine
from 0-9.  But the choice you are to make at 10...IMO the game does a
horrible job of giving you the information you need to make an educated
decision about which subclass is the one for you.
