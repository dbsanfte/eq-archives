Until you get Complete Healing, there's no reason to let the tank
pull down any more health than you can heal in one cast, IMO.  I'd
rather have the tank at full health when he screws up and overpulls
so that I can heal as late as possible.  If he's pulling at two red, that
means I'm going to *have* to heal him sooner.   The faster you heal
the more chance you have of drawing agro.   (Once you get Complete
Healing, it's a waste of mana to keep the tank at full health, and you
generally have a lot more feeling for how much health is safe.)

Heals get more efficient the higher you go, so there's no reason to
use a smaller heal than necessary.  By the same light, there's no
reason to use a bigger heal than necessary either.  Personally, I don't
think you need any healing choices until you get Greater Healing at
24.   Then you use GHeal on the melees and just Healing on the
casters, if you need to switch even them.   Before then switching
heals is a waste, IMO.

AC is, in part, dependant upon getting hit (your defense skill only
increases when you get hit.)  So DO make sure that you get hit
from time to time, even if that means tanking a pull for a moment
or so before letting the tank taunt it off you.

As you level you'll find that groups actually do know when the cleric
is getting pounded on, so don't get too used to screaming for help.
I created one early on, but I think I've only actually used it twice.
