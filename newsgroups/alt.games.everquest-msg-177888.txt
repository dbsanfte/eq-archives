Heh.  I actually hadn't thought about buffs either way.  I guess if I were
staging such a match as referee, I'd allow the warrior any buffs ahead of
the fight that they could get, but no outside spells (heals, buff refresh,
etc.) after the fight began.  Oh well, just an intersting thought, even if
the warrior would lose.
