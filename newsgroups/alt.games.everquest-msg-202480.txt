<Unnecessary insult snipped>

Y'know, I had a rather verbose response all typed up, then it hit me ....
you're just spoiling for a fight because someone else stole your crutch.
And there's not a thing in this whole wide world you can do about it.

You snipped the part where it was mentioned that, if your characters are 43,
you'll be unaffected by this anyway.

So what other reason is there for your response than to simply invoke an
arguement?

I tried to show you the other side of the coin.  You started throwing
insults.  If you want a fight, you'll not get one from me.  There's nothing
to fight about.

SOE made the change, not me.  I suggest you decide if you're going to deal
with it or leave.
