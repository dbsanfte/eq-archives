Still one of my best memories in EQ was being picked up by  a bard while
fleeing Slate with my SK, got an invite, accepted when I saw it was a bard
and realised what was on offer and then enjoyed EQ in Timedemo mode,
hilarious, when we zoned I expected to see an FPS figure appear :ï¿½)

Recently in Guild chat (my old guild no longer exists except for alt's)
someone made a comment about resists being reset after 232, anything over
treated as Zero, I didn't argue this (no experience to back it up) but this
would seem like a pretty serious bug not to have been dealt with. Can anyone
shed any light on this, was my guild mate talking crap or did this bug once
exist?

Sorry my post offers no answers to your question, I can count the amount of
times I have been to WL on one hand and the amount of time in minutes on
two...Joys of being in Europe when the rest of the guild are in the US, they
prepare for a raid and I, maybe, play taxi then go to bed...

(The bard in my story was low 50's and used the tamborine so I can only
guess at how fast you travel)
