Most outdoor mobs wander around and/or despawn eventually.  Aside from
some guards, there aren't a lot of places you can be running along and
run into some NPCs that will kill you and then stay at your corpse
forever.  Furthermore, in most places where that *can* happen (e.g.,
bandit camps), the mobs are usually popular hunting targets, and so it
is just a matter of waiting a while for a group to come along and clear
the camp.

Same thing in dungeons...someone will usually come along and clear the
mobs for you soon.

It's quite believable that one could reach level 36 and not have died in
one of the spots where the mobs are aggressive, static, non-despawning,
and in a place where almost no one goes to fight them.
