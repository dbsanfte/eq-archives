If I understand both what Verant and you are saying correctly, then no. The
'extra' exp that the hybrid generates only goes to the hybrid - they will
still get more of the overall exp (which doesn't change) as they are higher
level. The L13 characters would be better off grouping with another L13
(assuming they are hunting stuff a group of L13s can kill at a reasonable
rate).

The idea of the changes (as far as I can see) is that there is no longer a
penalty for grouping with a hybrid. Used to be, if you grouped with a
hybrid, everyone in the group would get less exp than if you were grouped
with a non-hybrid. It's still a better idea to group with people your own
level where possible.

Of course, I could just be misinterpreting the whole thing completely.
