Get a group and go to Warsliks woods. The giants there are good xp and
loot til 27ish, then try going for the skulking brutes at the entrance
to Dalnir - They'll get you past 30.

Just beware that the Iksar guards aren't keen on Trolls - or any other
for that matter. But you'll be able to shop and bank in The Overthere.

Good luck - Have fun
GF
