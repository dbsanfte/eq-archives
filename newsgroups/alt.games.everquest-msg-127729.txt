Sigh. Of course they'll tell you you can't pickpocket in combat, but they'll
leave you hanging as to whether you can pickpocket a bug. Oddly, I've gotten
skill increases from *begging* at bugs...

Well, I'll try Picking Pockets on the guards in Shar Vahl. They've never
helped me in a fight and, judging by their equipment, they can afford to
spare a few plat for me.

Oh well, just goes to confirm my estimation of Shar Vahl as worst newbie zone.
Shar Vahl: Even more annoying than Toxx Forest! :)
