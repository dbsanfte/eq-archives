After downloading the new patch I cannot connect to the new patcher.  I
click on everquest and the patcher starts for a second then I get an error
pop up that says...

Patch error: Could not update the patcher.  The patcher files may currently
be in use or the user does not have the proper access priveliges.  Please
check with your administrator if you believe this to be an error.

I have reinstalled all EQ and still have the problem.  After install I was
able to connect to the old patcher to get all old patches but nothing for
the new patcher.

Any suggestions would help.  Or has anyone else had this problem?
