Well... you could also try Tunare Highelf/Woodelf combos as well... that's
what I have... but I'm sure there are more.

If you can get an Enchanter of any particular religion or race, then there's
prolly also a Cleric of at least the same religion to Imbue for him (or
maybe a Shammie for Rallos Zek, a Wizzie for Sol Ro)

I got interested in the Imbued Cultural smithing... and what combinations of
classes could wear what... after my Tunare Woodelf Druid (brewing 168,
baking 142, fishing 138) got Imbue Emerald.
Now I also have a Highelf Cleric (blacksmith 192), a Highelf Enchanter (need
more levels on this guy), a Woodelf Ranger (Tailor 135... uses 4
self-tailored quivers for pharming pelts/silks) and a Highelf Paladin (also
needs levels, supposed to be getting this guy ready to hunt Mistmoore for
temper drops)

Of course, I didn't realise what a PAIN in the ass elven tempers are to get.
:o)
