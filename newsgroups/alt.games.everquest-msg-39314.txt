That's right.

Nope. Loot does not factor into the XP equation at all. The mob's
level and the ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) are all that matters.

The giants are crap for EXP because they have unusually high HP,
being giants. A level 35 hill giant in Rathe yields exactly the 
same EXP as a level 35 cactus in Overthere (assuming the ZEM for
those two zones is equal...I'm pretty sure all outdoor zones have
the same ZEM of 75). The cactus with its lower HP and lower 
damage output is easier to kill, though.

The ZEM is significantly higher in dungeons...typically 100 and
more in some cases. Hence a level 35 mob in a dungeon will yield
an extra 33% or more EXP versus a level 35 mob in an outdoor zone.
