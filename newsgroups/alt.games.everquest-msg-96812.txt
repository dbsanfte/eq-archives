    Now it'll be a smooth progression up to 51, at least. Before you'd do 45
(which is most like post-50), then forget about it for five levels.

    *puts on "bitter old man" costume* Sonny, I did 54 when we had no blue
XP line. I did 54 when we had no light blue cons. I did 54 in Karnor's, at
the front, where we'd get the odd *green*. I did 54 when tanks had Short
Swords of the Ykesha standard, and the "uberguild" tanks had Lammys, CSSs
and Jade Maces. And *you* get pains in yer arm? HA! <cough, wheeze>
