Indeed I wouldnt be surprised on that - but its still a problem that they
coded in at that point. It meant the game  fell over. Now the companies
that did the same AFTER the problems they have really really
annoyed...despite being good games a the core (Netstorm and I76 would be
there)


It might be interesting to see what people thought in MMORPGs would fall
into such a bracket...
