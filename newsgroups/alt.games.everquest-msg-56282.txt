Case in point, I just tried to log in.  Its 1:12 pm EST, assuming a
patch that started at 6am my time, thats more than an hour over
the expected 6 hour time.

Are they still patching, or is there just a huge rush of people
trying to log in?

Both are logical conclusions from what I know plus the message
I get back.  I tried to log in six times, just to be sure... and if
I'd gotten a "we are patching" message on the first try, I wouldn't
have had to do that.  If they -aren't- patching anymore, and
I knew that to be the case from the message, then I wouldn't be
here griping.
