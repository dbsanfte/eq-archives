If the group wants a warrior or SK or Pali its because they want a tank.
If the group wants a ranger, rogue or monk its because they want DPS.

The same limitation for a rogue as monk and ranger doesn't break the class

Guild_Mage lands a critical blast!(2020)
Guild_Druid lands a critical blast!(2192)
Guild_Wiz lands a critical blast!(6482)

Yeah, wizards are REALLY under-powered.

Our last VT clearing the wizzies were all logging their damage(some kind of
class dick waving), huge AC mobs with absolutly massive amounts of
hitpoints, the wizards ALL did OVER 130,000 damage EACH on TVK.

**NO** other class came even CLOSE to that damage

Why are your AA's any more useless than other classes?  I call bs

Umm.. you have become better at supporting arguments by pulling excuses out

Whats not balanced?

Yeah, and how many can land a nuke for 6k with a STANDARD nuke?

Pharmers got their manaburn "nerfed"... wizards got some awesome PoP
upgrades

The only gimp is you, whining every fucking week what a ruined class wizards
are

You have become better at not having a clue (200)

In Velious while I was doing 50dps, guild wizards would proclaim at the end
of a Doze fight, "hmm i did 130k damage that fight..", I doubt I even did
30k

In vexthal I do a few k damage to a boss, a wizard does over 130k by himself

Wizzies have incredible DPS
Wizzies have snare, root
Wizzies have self-buffed mana regen
Wizzies have self only runes for melee AND spells
Wizzies can port, TL

What exactly are they lacking?
