It would have been fine if it was finished, rather than just being "part 1"
of the next book.  Just as Jordan finished warming up and the book started
to go somewhere, he ended it with little more ado than a great big "To be

created and no longer enjoys telling that story.   That he only sticks with
writing it because it actually pays the bills.   A pretty rare thing in
professional writing.
