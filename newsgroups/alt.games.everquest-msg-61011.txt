Ok I have been slowly trudging my way through the 40's.  I was wondering
what zones that I could hunt in for both XP and loot.  I am not into the
whole Dreadlands, Overthere xp route.  Most of Norraths idiots are the ones
who level there.  They they come into a dungeon and get you killed.  I am a
43 ranger and besides soloing animals in EW and GD and soloing geonids in
CC, I am wondering what other zones I could go to for both xp and loot.  Any
ideas are most welcome.  Some of the zones I have tried are:
Lower Guk got lost on the deadside and dies
Sol B way too overcamped
Kaesora

Now I know lootwise that there is some awesome stuff that comes out of those
zones, but the problem is you need to be screwing your brothers sisters
mothers uncle to get in some of those groups.  I just want to level and have
fun, loot is secondary but is much appreciated at the end of the night.  And
outdoor zones don't cut it in terms of loot.
