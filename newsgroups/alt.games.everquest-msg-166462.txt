It's not impossible but when I read about motion sickness in games it felt
like the symptoms were more like throwing up or feeling bad while playing.
Not after one day.

But it might be another form of the same phenomenon because it definitely
has to do with games (movements, flashing lights etc) and not when looking
at plain text.
