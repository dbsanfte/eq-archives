Why would I remember "melee > bows" when for a large portion of the players
it's simply not true.  Droppable bows are far far *far* better than
droppable weapons.  Rangers can get the AAs to make good use of those long
before hitting elementals.

It's a limited window.  Under-59 and post-elemental rangers play by
different rules.  But the 59-65 pre-elemental (and even elemental until
you've been there a while) rangers are well served by archery.
