No, its nothing.  Says UP when they are in mid patch, simply because 
they have the server running for the devs to test it.  Rarely does it 
ever say DOWN.  Would it be hard to put accurate info on this page, and 
would it make my life easier if they did?  Sure.  But at the moment, 
they don't, so this is precisely what I'm complaining about.
