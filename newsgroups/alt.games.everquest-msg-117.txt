Dec 19th is PATCH DAY !

I like to play twinks after the patch - less xp to recover if the
servers crashed or a zone has becomed bugged !

Ok. Here's the patch possibilities-
1. Patch runs late.
2. Patch requires a 2nd unannounced patch (I like to think of it as the
"hidden second half of a patch")
3. Given quest gets bugged
4. Given zone gets bugged
5. Lag forces EQ down
6. Factions get messed
7. Unexplained zone crash
8. Unexplained server crash

I'm betting this time will be #1. We haven't had it in a while, and I
don't think there is major stuff getting done this time.

Anyone else ?
