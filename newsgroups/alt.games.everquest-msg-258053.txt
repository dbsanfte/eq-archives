Or, simply
/pet assist
/loot

for us beastmasters and other lesser pet classes =)

I also use the same quickloot macro in middle of fights sometimes, to
quickly get on the unmezzed mob, since my pet will be fighting it.

I always thought they should respond something funny, that I should kill
them before looting them, in the same way that I always tease groupmates who
accidentally inspect me when trying to loot. =)
