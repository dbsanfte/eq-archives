You said the one that has no way of getting mana back faster than a normal
med rate.  You are entirely, completely, devastatingly incorrect.  Breeze,
Clarity, Clarity II, KEI, Clarity 4, POTC, Spiritual Purity, Spiritual
Radiance, Mod Rods, Mod Rod 2, Flowing Thought, Meditation Bonus items... you
are rich indeed in possible ways to get mana back faster than your normal med
rate.  Oh, I forgot, bard song, necro twitch, and a funky necro "steal from
the mob and give to the group" line.

Bards, on the other hand, gain mana back at one and only one rate, dead slow.

While you don't yet have a way to increase your mana regen rate via a spell
you can cast yourself, you can freely group with others, or get others to
buff you up, preferably by trading summoned items for buffs.
