I can understand your desire to move to a new server to join a friendly
guild, but have you really considered what that will cost you? I dont mean
just the hard cash Verant will charge you to move to a new server, but also
the fact that you will lose all equipment in that move. For a level 49
cleric that must amount to some fairly reasonable items, all of which may be
quickly replaced if you manage to join the right guild, with the right
resources, but for a while at least you will be effectively "naked".

There must be at least one or two guilds on your current server that would
accept you, espcecially if you like to put in the time to help others. I
suggest it would be better for you to search out those guilds where you are
rather than move server.

If you do decide to move server then I wish you every luck, and I hope that
you don't lose your interest when having to build up your equipment all over
again.
