My favorite site is xornn's <http://members.tripod.com/xornn/>. It has
*meticulous* descriptions of enchanter strategies for soloing and grouping,
via charming, animations, etc, and detailed spell lineups. Also has quite
a bit of commentary on why the strategies work.

I'd look elsewhere for enchanter quests, hunting guides, and spell vendor
info though.
