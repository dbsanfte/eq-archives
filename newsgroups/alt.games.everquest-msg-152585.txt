 I'm not really sure I would consider filling 8 backpacks full of
bonechips 'easy'. I mean, it's not hard killing wimp skellies. But 1600
bonechips, plus all the clicking handing them to him... Sounds like
torture to me!

 As for CT, I'm not sure you can build faction with him. However, you're
a Monk so you can sneak.

 And if you're just doing faction work, I'd probably avoid Sarnaks. Who
knows, in the future you may want to do the Chardok quests.
