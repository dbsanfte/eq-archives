You can complete the quest without having passed trials, you'll just get no 
benefit from having done it until you do pass the trials.

We just got my girlfriend through trials last night, a few weeks after she 
completed her BoT key quest.  On passing the trials, her PoP charm went up 
in stats, and when she had the seer unlock memories it went up again and 
she was able to get both her "free" AAs.
