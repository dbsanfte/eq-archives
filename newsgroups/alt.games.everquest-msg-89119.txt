Recent post about trains made me think "What numbskull would train
their own wedding?" Well, actually ive always assumed weddings would
be held in pretty, quiet places.....but this is EQ and we're all chain
pulling adventuers. I thought the big open area by the Efp to Wfp zone
would always make a trashy wedding spot...hell...its Freeport after
all....might as well have it in the sewers among the drowned citizens.
Then i though high danger would be great. my picks include:

5) top of hill in Rathe Mountains where giants spawn.
4) entrance to outpost in OT where cliff golem paces back and forth
3) at the bottom of a web pit in dreadlands
2) in the tower on the island in the oasis
1) at the wizard portal in SkyFire mountains

you can tell from my selections that i havent been to a lot of good
places.
i thought maybe the worst of the worst would be a great place for a
wedding.....espcially since i expect a lot of under 10th levels to be
there. (maybe not if its planar)
