No, it was not always 30 seconds, it used to be 36 seconds.  However,
upon checking Lucy to verify, I see that the min duration limit was
changed in the 4/23 patch, not this week's patch.  I hadn't noticed,
as it was before the change that I got irritated because my lowbie
Enchanter on Test lost all benefit from affliction foci (after the
prior nerf made them no longer help with root).
