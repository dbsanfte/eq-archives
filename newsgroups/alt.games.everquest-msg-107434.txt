To say nothing of the fact that it's just possible that the original
poster was mistaken about just *who* pulled the train. =p Perhaps
Baroness Safana was simply chasing it out. I remember quite vividly
being accused of something similar in Unrest once. Here I am,
50-something druid in wolf form sitting by the pond out front; I had
just dropped in about 2 minutes earlier to throw a few buffs on my RL
cousin and his group. So, I go /afk for a minute to answer a phone call
and when I come back I am surrounded by corpses and some asshole is
berating me in tells for training him in the house. I say I'm sorry you
died; but I assure you, I didn't pull the train. I explain I am not KOS
to anything in the zone in wolf form. I explain I have only been in zone
a very short time, was /afk when the train blew through, and that I have
not been any further inside that the pond out front. I explain I could
take almost any mob in the place out with one nuke. Hell, I would have
been hard pressed to pull a train in the place if I had *tried* for
heaven's sake. He keeps on and on and on about how it's my fault he has
to make a corpse run, what a rude, inconsiderate person I am for *lying*
to him about it and how I should take responsibility for my own
mistakes. Um, yes, Skippy, I do believe in personal responsibility; I do
not, however, normally take blame for stuff I am 100% sure I didn't do.
=P I finally put the jackass on ignore when I figured he wasn't smart
enough to understand what I was telling him; but it really pissed me off
at the time. /shrug
