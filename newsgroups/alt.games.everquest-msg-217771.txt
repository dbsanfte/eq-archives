Sure feels that way, but it's not really.

Psychologicly it's a bit hard to deal with, but I can understand the
reasoning behind it.  If they used a flatter scale, then either the level
40's would be walking away from the adventure merchant with 70 AC
breastplates with Vengence III on them, or the level 65's would be plugging
away at hundreds of adventures before they were able to afford even a single
upgrade.

Giving massive points for 60+ (where you can get drops close to this) while
not giving many points at 40'ish is the only way they could accopmlish both
goals.  Making high quality equipment accessable to the high level players
without making it trivial to get for lower level twinks.

For instance... there is a mask at Tak for 996 points.  It has great stats
and Vengence II on it.   For a level 60, thats only 20'ish adventures.   A
lot, but doable.   For a level 45, thats over 100 adventures.    But thats
where they want it, because having Vengence II on a level 40 is obscenely
overpowered, compared to the "recommended" equipment for that level.

I'm actually quite happy with how it worked out.   My rogue is gaining
groups much easier than before, and leveling quickly, and at the same time
chipping away at the point values she will later need.  It may not make a
huge difference, but by the time she hits 60 she'll be 700 points closer to
the items she wants than if it had not been added.   Or if it had been "only
level 65's gain points" or some other control.
