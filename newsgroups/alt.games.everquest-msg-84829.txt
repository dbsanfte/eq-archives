Yeah but there are kind of some problems with their math. I think they
are assuming the online number of all 400,000 subscribers at anyone
time being roughly one quarter of all such subscribers at most or
perhaps similar math per the more active servers. No guaruntee that it
will translate over to this server though even if they DO get 8,000 to
do this. They may have to actually allow twice that or more to keep
this server at 2 k. 2 k is about what a medium pop server like mine,
the tribunal, averages during normal play time I'd guess.. and its not
really seeming crowded to me except for uber raiding "gank the dragon
or rare epic spawned mob" purposes.

Oh ok.. I should have read further you said the same thing as me ..
ahaha. Yeah I'm guessing average during peak too.
