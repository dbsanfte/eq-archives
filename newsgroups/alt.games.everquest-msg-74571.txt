Ya might wanna go for a GForce3 rather than an ATI, unless you want all the
TV bits that card has. Why? well the GForce range have now become so popular
nearly all apps and games work on them. At work we have a mix and match of
ATI and GForce cards. ATI always has problems, and their driver support
seems to be slow at updating and fixing bugs. They are nice cards tho with
some good features.
