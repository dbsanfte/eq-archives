I'm a 62 Shammy who has yet to get flagged, as I'm not in a large
guild (They haven't even started to think of trials).  I've gotten in
some pickup groups that ended in failing the Trial of Execution, but
it seems to me that most don't want a Shammy in a Trials group.  I do
have my area slow, but without the DPS of other classes, I guess I'm
not wanted.

I do get a dozen tells a day to come to PoV.... go figure.

With that said, where can a 62 Shammy go, both with group and solo, to
get decent experience?  Been doing Factory, Hedge, Courtyards, etc... 
I don't get a choice much of the time.

Would it be a good time to just switch to 100% AA and do the normal
Tier 1 planes zones?
Thanks
