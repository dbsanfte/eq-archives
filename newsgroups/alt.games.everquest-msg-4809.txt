Get a friend who's a druid and get them to cast harmony (or is it
harmonize?).  The fire away with a bow at a mob toward the front of the
group.  Otherwise, get a Monk FD his way back to the group with 1 or 2 mobs
following.  Warriors are great for giving/dealing punishment once the mob
gets to the fight, they have a hard time being selective about just who they
fight.
