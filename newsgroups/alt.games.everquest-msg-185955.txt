'Toons'?

No, I don't do tradeskilling.  I usually just buy better equipment, if I
can, although there seems to be quite a leap between the 4-gold-piece
useless armour and the 5,286-platinum-piece fantastic dog's-bollocks,
bee's-knees, cat's-whiskers shiny armour that's too heavy for me to carry
anyway...

Maybe I'm just crap.

Actually, strike the 'maybe'...  :o/

No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
