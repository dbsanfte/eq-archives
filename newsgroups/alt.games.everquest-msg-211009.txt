THeir are actualy 2 ways into this zone, from SOL A and from SOL B.  near
the top of sol B (forgive me sol a'ers i did not poke my head around much on
that side) From sol B, if you go up past bugs room uphill to the 0 bridge
(the bridge over lava with a big hole in the middle). Their will be lava
toyour left, if you have agro their is a SOL A zoneline right their too,
just keep going uphill.

Anyway, to your left on the 0 bridge you will see a Lavafall, you must
Jump/lev to it (it's an easy jump to the top of the Lavafall). Then you must
dispell Lev if you have it on because you will only zone in if you are in
the Lava, if you keep the lev on, you will zone to SOL A. Sol A zone is the
same way, if you zone in and you are above lava, you will go to sol B, if
you are in the lava, SOL C.

We didnt get to far, but got one drop, a 2hb 30 30 staff that was NONE/NONE
usable, had some other stats (failry nice if memory serves) Hope this staf
is just broken, and not another teaser item.

Also we noticed their is a named NPC to the left if you zone in from SOL B,
gives out a quest that we got one of the drops for already (woot). Mobs were
mostly 50 to 58 area, with one red named that judging by damage output and
such was 60 area.

Zoning in form SOL A TAKES YOU TO A DIFFRENT SPOT IN ZONE. so be careful
here.

Also the Lava here is nasty, and you got a descent swim in it no matter
which way you come from, so have 2k hp atleast, or a Divine barrier. Also of
note, Getting out is REALY tricky, because you pop out in the lava on the
SOL B side, so have a lev on you, or you got a long hot, nasty swim to land,
and a few LDC's to fight when you get their. Or just find a port.

Hope this helps.

Also the kobalds at SOL B inzone are a mix of WIzzards and shammys and
warriors (i belive, may be rogues, but we didnt see any backstabs and they
hit more like warriors)

Mystics = shammys (big shock huh?)
Bloodclaws = Warriors
Firewalker = wizzys (they do not seem to Gate BTW, but they do 650pt rain
and Ice Commit for 1150).
