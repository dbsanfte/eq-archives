As I don't have a lot of time to play (and have guildies I'm trying to
keep up with), I mostly focus on my top two-box duo and shy away from
starting over with new characters, so when I started a shaman alt it was
just to have an alchemist in my tradeskill stable.  I PLed her into the
30s to get her access to some spells that might be useful if she ever
needed to collect stuff herself, and then got started on alchemy.

Like Lance, I ended up looking up the various recipes at EQTC, but since
I wasn't trying to go adventuring I didn't care about whether stuff was
usable at my level.  I did try making some snare Suspensions for my monk,
but they always seemed to be resisted, so I gave up using them.  (The monk
has the "Ball of Burlap Yarn" snare item from Stonebrunt/Warrens for use
in emergencies anyway.)

At the higher skill levels (my Alchemy is at 271 so far) I've been using
the recipes with dropped ingredients, and have farmed some of those drops
myself, but I find I can get more DWInk and NBLily than I'll ever need at
10pp each using my Buyer in the Bazaar.  Each of those (plus about 1pp of
vendor parts) makes 5 potions, and the potions easily sell in the Bazaar
for 8-10pp and up, so even after losing ingredients on failures I can make
a modest profit while skilling up.  For some of the higher rank potions
the dropped parts (Lucidem, Curzon, Vers. Fungus, Sunshard Powder, etc.)
can often also be found cheaply on NPC merchants where players have sold
to them.

I make various pots of rank IX to XI; at skill 271 the rank XI succeeds
about 2/3 of the time, which is good enough given the return I get, but I
still mostly stick to IX and X for now.  Given my main duo, I've been
making Clarity (mana regen), Alacrity (haste), Celestial Healing (heal
over time), and Replenishment (hp regen).

The Skinspikes potions are more annoying because the recipe only makes 1
at a time.  But as Lance says, you need a "real" damage shield in order
for worn "+DS" items to kick in, so I make those also.  But a lot of the
time I'm stingy and settle for the 8-point base DS from my Coldain ring
(which alas does NOT stack with the pots).

Yes, there's a cap on how far the trophy can evolve.  Each time your skill
reaches a new multiple of 50, the trophy can evolve one more level and
will begin gaining xp again.  If you reach the next multiple of 50 before
the trophy finishes evolving that level, the trophy will evolve at about
ten times the usual rate until it catches up.

I used wisdom pots in some of my early tradeskilling (there's a trivial
quest in Rivervale that sometimes awarded a Potion of Wisdom to my druid,
who's my main tradeskiller), but at this point mostly I have an array of
+WIS gear that I hand around to whoever needs it.  Othmir Fur Cap for +6,
Misty Thicket Picnic +5, Palladium Ruby Engagement Ring +10, Bracelet of
Sense +15, Festive Doll +15, Shield of Bane Warding +20, ...  The shaman
could get to her cap of 255 wisdom without potions.  More of a pain if
you do go adventuring, though, since you need to swap lots of gear around.
