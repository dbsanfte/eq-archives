I think that if you are lucky and put all your points in pottery, that 
you may succeed (dang how do you spell that word, don't look right)

Definately look up the pottery quest at eqtraders.com on the quests link.

The pottery quest is a pain to do but worth it because you get a good 
drum out of it.  You also get another instrument later on.

Very hard to make money in Sharvahl area unless you know what sells. 
Darkclaw claws - tinkering component
HQ rockhopper hides - many tailoring uses, don't sell for less than 25 
to 30pp each, the tailor will still make money on the deal.
other quality hopper hides - Leather padding -- set your price on them, 
I've seen them go very high.
shadeling silks - make strings and sell for 4pp each, price them side by 
side with silks at 1pp and the strings will sell first every time. 
Stupid tradeskillers.  Or use all your strings to make padding.
Shade silks - again used in tailoring, not sure on suggested price

Take all the listed stuff you get down to the bazaar, set yourself up 
for a few hours, come back rich.  Might want to adjust prices for your 
server, some economies can handle higher prices than others.

Good luck
