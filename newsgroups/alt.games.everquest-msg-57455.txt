I have a lvl 40 Half Elf Warr

I understand that certain diciplines are available, but I don't  know
at what level

I was tring to set up a hot key for "resistant" and as the result of a
typo I got the following response

<Usage:/discipline
resistant|fearless|agressive|precise|defensive|evasive|furious|charge|mightystrile|fellstrike|fortitude>

(Idon't know why but for some reason I can't leave the space between
"discipline" and "resistant" in the above string.)

Is a hot key required for each of these disciplines?, Or of course,
they could be typed in individually. Hmm

It should be obvious from the above that I am clueless as to how and
when and why and where these things should/could be used, and if there
is a specific lvl where they are available. I also need to know how
often these things can be used. Every hour, 30 min, 10 min etc. I am
not even sure what they do other than the implication provided by the
verb.

Is there a DISCIPLINES 101 available somewhere?

Any help appriciaated

CML
