In most fantasies, perhaps not.  In Everquest?  Skyshrine sure looks a
lot like a city to me, and the Temple of Veeshan is also full of
dragons, so there is certainly precedence for draconic cities and
communities.  In fact Skyshrine could easily be used as the starting
city, though there is no newbie zone immediately available.

Though I guess they could have dragons start at level 50, then the
newbies could go hunt in the Wakening Land. :-)
