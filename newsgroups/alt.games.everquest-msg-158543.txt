Well, I can't say that I was going off too irrationally there. That's
my opinion. I just don't think you have given enough reason to be
upset about the new portals. Taking away the argument that you will
not be able to make money with the ease of old, you haven't given us
anything.

You basically say you want to be useful to your friends. I certainly
hope they "keep you around" for a bit more than convenient ports.

You say you like being able to provide porting service to your friends
with their own best interests in mind. Surely you don't mean you want
them to have ports available to them, just that they would have to get
them from you, do you?

I've re-read the posts, and I'm sorry, but I can't see how this takes
away anything from you (well, except the whole port whore thing, but
we've ruled that out, right?) beyond the dependence your friends had
on you before.
