Sounds like they are not sure which method they want to use.  If they try to 
modify the 1st hit rule (presumably to squelch powerleveling) then they make 
it trivial for a group to killsteal an individual.  Which is better?
1. Most damage takes all the xp.
2. First hit takes all the xp.
3. Split xp based on % damage (but total group damage/xp is split evenly)
As far as a combination of 1 and 2, I dont think anyone can even propose a 
reasonable middle ground that does not include all of the flaws of each 
combined.  In any case, they should say what the rules are and stick to 
them.  Saying it is 1st hit rule and then retarding it without telling is a 
foul game.
