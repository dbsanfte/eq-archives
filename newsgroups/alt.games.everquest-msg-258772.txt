*shrug* The quests being soloable by a different class is, in fact,
a side-effect of the stupidity we're both complaining about.  If
you're "making it difficult" for the quester by the unimaginative
and incredibly stupidly punitive approach of negating his/her class
strengths (rather than demanding those strengths AND more), then a
character with other strengths will quite likely be able to defeat
the mob with ease.

Still happens to me as a Paladin.  Most often it's an ignorant, know
it all caster making my mana bar near-useless (unimaginative control
freak Clerics are the worst).  Reading TSW you'd expect that grouping
with Warriors would be a pita (there's little love shown for Paladins
there, heh), but IME Warriors are almost always excellent groupmates
and we rarely have trouble arranging our roles unless casters butt in
and make a mess of things.  You should start getting the chance to
group more often with Warriors who have good aggro gear and a good
understanding of what they can do with their class' aggro tools.  For
me, there are few groups more fun than those where I can toss 4-8
stuns per fight and still have a Warrior taking most of the melee
damage.  Paladin is a ton of fun when you really get to go all out
with your "utility":  interrupting casters, helping with CC, patch
healing, adding your bit of damage, doing a little tanking on the
side, and pulling if there's no better class for it in the group.

Your description of the Berserker class really sounds like they're
sort of a "hybrid without a spellbook".  If I can find Warriors who
are good enough at aggro to let me go all out, I'm sure you'll be
able to find some who'll allow you to do the same.  You just can't
depend on it in any given pickup group is all.
