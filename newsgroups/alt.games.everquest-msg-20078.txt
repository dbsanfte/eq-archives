Yes, I believe the person said that the GM looked at the NPCs
inventory and read the logs to tell if the quest was completed and
rewarded.

Your right it could all be just BS, but I inferred from his post that
the n00b handed in the wrong item with all the other quest items and
wanted the GM to get that item back for him. His lack of detail about
the botched actions and items speaks volumes to either his being a
troll or he just screwed up and was looking for sympathy like many of
the GM bashers who seem to be detail light about what caused the GM to
single them out in the first place, but have managed to be quite
detailed as to the GM's actions towards them.
