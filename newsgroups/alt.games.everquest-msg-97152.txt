Then why have rules in the first place, if in the end
it's all up to the whim of the judges?

The entire purpose of rules (and laws) is to have
a clear, specific list of what is required, what is 
prohibited, and (by implication) what is allowed.

Study law sometime, then get back to us.

Courts, when run properly, rule on the letter of the law
and not the spirit of the law.  The spirit should only
be considered to the extent that it resolves arguments
over ambiguous wording.

Otherwise, the whole body of written law crumbles as
courts "go beyond" the written law and apply their own
personal views of what the "spirit" might be, and how
far it might extend.

This is the reason we have written laws, why legislatures
(and the framers of the Constitution) wrangle long and
hard over minute changes in wording for proposed
laws/treaties/amendments, why lawyers spend so much
time invoking Sec 18b(12)A3 of the penal code, and so on.

Appeals courts routinely overturn rulings which
follow the "spirit" of the law but which cannot be
supported by the letter of the law.

So what to do about cases where someone does something
that's within the letter of the law but violates the
"intent" of the law?  You don't just throw them in jail
anyway and say, "well, that's not really a violation of
the law as written, but close enough" -- that's a
prescription for a classic tyranny.  Instead, you just
amend the letter of the law to specifically include
that particular case as well.

The entire reason we have written law is so that
people can look and see, specifically, what is prohibited
and what is not.  If people can be convicted for
"whatever we wrote down, plus whatever else we forgot
to mention", the whole system breaks down.  The
written law is the only law.  No more, no less.
A chief tenet of the law is that if a specific case
isn't covered in the written law, it's not prohibited,
and in fact is implicitly allowed *because* it wasn't
covered.  In essence, "if they wanted to prohibit
that, they'd have written it into the law".

The classic description of "letter of the law"
issue was written by Supreme Court Chief Justice
John Marshall, in Sturges v. Crowninshield,
17 U.S. 122, 202-203 (1819):

   "... although the spirit of an instrument, 
   especially of a constitution, is to be respected 
   not less than its letter, yet the spirit is to be 
   collected chiefly from its words. It would be 
   dangerous in the extreme, to infer from extrinsic 
   circumstances, that a case for which the words of 
   an instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted
   from its operation. Where words conflict with each
   other, where the different clauses of an instrument 
   bear upon each other, and would be inconsistent, 
   unless the natural and common import of words be 
   varied, construction becomes necessary, and a departure 
   from the obvious meaning of words, is justifiable. 
   But if, in any case, the plain meaning of a provision, 
   not contradicted by any other provision in the same 
   instrument, is to be disregarded, because we believe 
   the framers of that instrument could not intend what 
   they say, it must be one in which the absurdity and 
   injustice of applying the provision to the case, would 
   be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, 
   unite in rejecting the application."

Lawyer Wesley Serra wrote it more succinctly in misc.legal:

  "Idealism has nothing to do with it.  If the letter 
   of the law is clear, then its spirit is, by definition, 
   contained in the letter.  In other words, if the  
   letter of the law is clear in its application to 
   a set of facts, then no discussion of "spirit" is in  
   order.  All sorts of bad episodes in this nation's history 
   have begun when the letter of the law is ignored in 
   favor of somebody's (usually a demagogue's) idea of its
   spirit."
