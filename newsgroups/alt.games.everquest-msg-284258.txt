He can spawn anywhere in the Southern half of South Karana, more or
less.  His placeholders can be any number of different mobs, literally
10-20 different names, most or all of them 'trash' mobs.  The only
thing unique factor is that these mobs spawn almost exactly 72 seconds
after the last one is killed.  For example, if you are the only one in
the zone and you kill the placeholder, 72 seconds later another will
spawn.  This is not true of any other mob in the zone, they all have
much longer respawn times.

What I did with my ranger was to make sure nothing in the entire zone
had died for a long time, so that respawns would not be consused.  If
someone else was hunting there, it wasn't worth trying to solo.  Then I
would agro as many as I could and wipe them all out at once.  With
tracksort on normal, I would see what would spawn after 72 seconds.
Track it down, kill it but nothing else and watch track again.  If I
found that a new mob was spawning every 72 seconds I knew I had found
the placeholder.  It took me a good hour or so to isolate the PHer, in
part just because of mistakes on my part and people on their way to Paw
killing this or that and screwing things up but once I had it down I
was able to keep it for several hours and ended up getting 4 or 5
cloaks.
