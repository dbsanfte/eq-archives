Yes, it does.:)

It's going to turn a lot of the EQ crowd off from the start, just by virtue
of the fact that there will be no abitrary PvP switch.

But, as with most of the MMORPG's that are currently in development, they're
designing the game around PvP and working on creating a workable system that
minimizes the effect of grief players, while allowing those that really
don't care to be involved in PvP combat to avoid it while still being able
to develop their character. With DAoC in particular, I'm pretty optimistic
that it'll succeed.


Getting away from the Fantasy genre, there's another game coming out this
summer that I'll be playing as well. If you're into History or war
simulations at all, you might check World War II Online out also:
