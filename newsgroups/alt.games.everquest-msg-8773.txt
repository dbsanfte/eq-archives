I stupidly wasn't logging this weekend, so I can't give exact quotes,
but I think I've been getting some new messages during melee and also
noticed a weird (but nice) change in the damage I'm doing.  For quite a
while I've occasionally got the "Jakugg has scored a critical hit! (87)"
message, followed by the "You slash a pickclaw guard for 87 points.."
   This weekend, I *think* only after I dinged 28, I believe I saw some
different messages during battle which referenced a "crippling blow" or
something to that effect.  And I am *positive* that the damage displayed
on the two lines was different.  IIRC, my best one said, "Jakugg has
scored a crippling blow!(153)" but then it was followed up with "You
slash a pickclaw warrior for 160 points of damage."   So it announced
one value, and then awarded me more damage each time than the original
quote.
  Is this just a bug in the system, or do you get some bonus damage on
top of whatever you "roll" on that attack?  And if so, does the bonus
increase as you go up? I'm about to break 30.(/em knocks on wood)  Is
that going to up my damage even more becasue of some additional hidden
damage cap?
  For reference, my STR is about 149 with my normal buffs/gear, and I'm
wielding a 24/49 weapon when fighting with my 2HS.
