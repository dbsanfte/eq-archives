I haven't had a lot of LDs, but have noticed problems while zoning.  It 
seems to me maybe the datarate.txt setting is being ignored.  What's 
yours set to?  If it's pretty high, try lowering it.  

Oh, and if you want to try LDoNs, go to Everfrost.  At least some of the 
time, the LDoN entrance is in the same zone, which should save you a few 
zones and increase your chances.
