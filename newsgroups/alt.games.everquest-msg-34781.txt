To elaborate on this theme... the madness caused by this person in CB
will end when he starts doing the same thing in Unrest and then
eventually again  in KC.  Some folks can't seem to make the connection

not worth playing in when some people are in them, just remember you
have the option to leave is my advice.  Easier to change location than
change ignorant minds.
