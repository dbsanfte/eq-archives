How are you using a button to move forward?
Map it to the forward arrow? Then keep repeating it?
I tried the repeat thing with a button to move backwards, and it doens't 
work quite right.

Here's more detail on my d-pad settings.

05 is the RED SHIFT configured as MOMENTARY.

dpad right - /con (C)
dpad down - attack (Q)
dpad up - ESC
dpad left - F1

REDdpad right - Invnetory (I)
REDdpad down - F9 X4 (3rd person view)
REDdpad up - F9 X1 (return to 1st person)
REDpad left - default

I configured 04 as a BLUE shift (TOGGLE), but very little there that is 
used. I'd be better off switching it back to selecting hotbank 4.

BLUESHIFT 09 - JUMP

I've tried to set up both a key, and the dpad, under the BLUE SHIFT as 
strafe, with no success.

I've also not managed to learn to hit the other 4 positions on the dpad 
reliably yet, so am only using the 4 primary directions.

Thanks for the info !
