First of all, I don't speed. It's too dangerous. Therefore, the cops
have no reason to pull me over. However, if they do pull me over they
better have a damned good reason, because they work for me. I pay their
salary. Tip: they really like being called "Civil Servant", especially
if you say it with a smug grin on your face. They are the equivalent of
a maid or a butler or a groundskeeper. You know, the hired help.
