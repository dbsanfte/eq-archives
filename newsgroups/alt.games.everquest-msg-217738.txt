Hi All

I finally got a couple of character to 20 on Bristlebane and decided to 
buy LDoN

So what is LDoN like for low level characters.

Well I now know I was wrong when I picked Bristlebane. I thought being 
near the bottom of the login list meant it was empty. Hehe, no prize 
here.

So first to 20 was my cleric.

First attempt. On with the LFG. Visited all the camps, sent a few polite 
random tells to ask if anyone was interested. 3 hours later gave up and 
logged off.

Second attempt. After 35 minutes found a group in East Common. Joined 
up, got to 6 in the group. Then 2 log without disbanding after a cryptic 
gsay of Oh! so and so is up. After a further 40 minutes we fail to find 
anyone else and drift off.

Now in both cases I did a /who all XX to find who was around at what 
level. This is where I found my error in choosing Bristlebane.

 From 20 to 27 there was an average of 14 players per level. 50% were in 
the Bazaar, 20% were in Paladual

While from 59+ the lists were always cut short.

But not being daunted. My 18 Beastlord  was told  that in Shadeweaver 
there was a camp of higher level poachers over the back of the mountains 
I thought was the zone edge.

So over I went and was amazed that I did 5 levels in 3 evenings after 
months of play to get to 18

So now with my 23 level Beastlord It was off to find a group.

Well after 2 false starts, a sorry a guildmate calling and Oh! my 57 
Paladin has been offered a group sorry.

We got a group

Beastlord 23
Ranger 2X
Cleric 23
Enchanter 26
Paladin25
Warrior 24

We got an adventure. Collect 29 items from Dreary Grotto in Mistmoore. 
Normal setting

We completed the adventure in 74 minutes cleared the dungeon of all on 
track by 1:20mins
We didn't open any boxes. Killed 89 inhabitants got 35 of the items to 
collect in total.

We got 1 aug "Cracked Green Shard of Might", 57pp each in sold loot.
I got 1 adventure point and 4 yellow bubbles of experience.
The average adventure points was 2 the highest was 3.

So now blooded it was off for my 2nd Adventure.

This time as well as the random tells I decided to try and organise a 
group as well.
After 45 mins and 1 false start.

With a party of 21 to 26. The Adventure recruiter told us our 21 was to 
low and refused to give us an adventure :(

So with apologies we lost our Rogue. We decided to try and do the 
adventure with 5.

So off  we went

Beastlord 24
Paladin 26
Bard 22
Ranger 25
Cleric 24

I choose a kill 60 inhabitants adventure in the Aisles of Blood in 
Mistmoore. Again normal setting

We completed in 73 mins killed all 64 of the inhabitants in 1:20mins and 
opened 1 chest at the end (By beating it to bits) nothing inside though

We got 5 augs "Cracked Blue Jewel of Nimbleness", "Cracked Emerald of 
Poison", "Cracked Grey Gemstone of Knowledge", "Cracked Turquoise 
Fragment of Intellect" & "Cracked Yellow Sphere of Fortitude" plus 38pp 
split in sold loot.

I got 1 adventure point again and 3.5 Yellow bubbles of experience and 
made 25 on completing the task :)

So overall. I like it though it is really hard work at getting groups 
together as most low level characters on Bristlebane are either bazaar 
mules or alts to higher characters

So is this a success. Humm! yes
