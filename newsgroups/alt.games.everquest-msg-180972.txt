I very occasionally undercut by 1pp, but usually only on cheap items.
Or when I'm too tired to figure out a reasonable margin...

Definition of stupidity:

When the "casinos" started happening, one person was offering to double your
money if you rolled over 400 (from 1000). Some poor sucker took this up
and the "casino" operator went link dead when the casino lost the roll.

Clearly they had not previously encountered the phrase "the house always
wins".

If I was into gambling, I might consider a bet where over 600 doubled my
money... but over 400 is a sucker bet, anybody with a clue will *know*
it's a scam.
