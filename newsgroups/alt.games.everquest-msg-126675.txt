I was thinking of heading to Marus Seru for tonight's session to see how I
go Charming  Zelniacs and Lightcrawlers around before trying some of the
more social animals there like Rockgrabbers and Grey Rockhoppers.

The xp is good there, no loot to speak but of prime importance, no casting
mobs* ; )

* occasionally one of the larger lightcrawlers will blind, but this is very
rare compared to dawnshroud.
