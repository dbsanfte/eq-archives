I posted about this recently -- as in, after mana numbers became visible.
I haven't been able to get any figures for INT/WIS over 200, but based on
lots of data I generated at lower stats I found these two formulas that
seem to be off by no more than 1 everywhere I've checked:

if STAT (int or wis) is under 100:

	LEVEL x (STAT + 193) / 13

if STAT is over 100 (but probably has to be under 200):

	LEVEL x (STAT + 20) x 3/16

The second formula differs slightly from the formula frequently seen on
caster web sites:

	LEVEL x (STAT + 10) / 5

which is where your "approximately L/5" per point of INT comes from.  My
formula is definitely more accurate in the 150 or so cases I checked.
