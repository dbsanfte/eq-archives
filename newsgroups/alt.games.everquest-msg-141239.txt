Since I support systems that (almost) alow end users to do direct sql
queries of huge dBs (million+ records per table over many tables) I can
imagine exactly what would happen. 

However even at it's busiest I have not seen much over 5000 items up for
sale.
Provided they set a max return (say 500 items) I cant see performance
being much worse than the grafix lag is atm <G>

Still I doubt that it would ever happen.

I did think of another upgrade that could be done for the bazaar.
Make a buyer's section.
List items and how much you will pay for them.
Make it only let you list utems up to your current bankroll.
Go afk over night and log back in to find your upgrades waiting.

This would make the economy in the bazaar much more fun <G>
Serious trades could end up being "personal shoppers" connecting the
lazy buyers (high offer) with the lazy sellers (Low price).
What fun.

The other thing I thought was how bad would it be if there was an option
to /camp trader ?
Say that it left you trading (but off line) for the next 8 hours.
Sure it would increase the number of traders, but how much really ?
Most of the people who are going to be selling are there anyway.
And how bad would a 50% increase in traders be for a zone that laggy
already.

I hate being punished for only having a 2 hour dial-up :-(
