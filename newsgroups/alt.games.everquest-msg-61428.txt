1.  Did you reinstall both your sound and video drivers after install DX8?

2.  If yes, then, make sure you get the latest video and sound drivers,
install them.

3.  If it still doesn't work, try Verant tech support.

I had trouble with DX8 and me GeForce2 card, had to go back to DX7 until a
new driver was released, now it works like a champ.
