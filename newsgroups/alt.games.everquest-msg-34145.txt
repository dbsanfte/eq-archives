I have a Level 8 Barbarian Warrior....That I think is just great....But
She cannot see
very well At night. I use big torches etc... but I was wandering and
hoping that someone could tell me of a means to get the best light at
night...I see light stones at
the "stores" and used a Light stone (still using it).... but it just
does not give the light I was hoping for...when its at the darkest time
of night.
If some folks  have some suggestions ?
thanks,

colladilli
