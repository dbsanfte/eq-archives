Druid can be subbed with Shammy for slows etc, but the best way to do Exe
trial is with heavy AoE. We had a 63 mage w/epic
pet, a 61 and modrods,  ench for slows and kei, a 61 warrior to MT, a 63
Wizzie and a 56 cleric. As soon as you get in room
all run to stage except MT who sits in middle of room. As mobs pop MT gets
aggro, others do not attack till MT has full aggro.
Then everyone who can AEs. As a 61 druid I used Fist of Karana and
Catastrophe ( Upheavel upgrade). At end of 1st fight
all (except MT, who sits in middle) go back to stage and use modrod once and
med for exactly 35 sec. Same thing for next waves
until able to use mod rod again. at end of 4th wave all run to back of room
(except MT). Cleric CHs and druid used quick heals (chloroblast - 3 sec cast
time)
to spt heal MT. If AEs are going slow and you need an insta kill to reset
clock on Exe, have mage or druid use banishment on a stone mob (elemental -
make sure you have star ruby component to cast banishment). Having two of
any one class in group could possibly make trial more difficult , I've never
played a Rogue but it seems that trying to get mobs set up so 2 Rogues can
BS can be tricky.
