I'm afraid there is not much "improvement" I could offer on the networking
side of things other than this:

Replace the ICS machine with router/hub combination.  Even then, I'm not
sure you'll see much of a performance increase.

On the issue of the hard drives, just keep in mind that each IDE channel is
single threaded; meaning an operation on one drive has to be completed
before the other drive can perform another operation.  So, avoid situations
where a hard drive and CD-ROM drive are being used on the same channel,
which it appears you have done.

Also, if you're running Windows 9X/ME, use...

Accessories->System Tools->System Monitor + Edit->Add Item->Memory Manager,
Swap File in Use

to determine how much swapping is being done on your machine.  If you are
doing more than about 10MB of swapping, get more memory.
