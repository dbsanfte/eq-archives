The issue comes up when an add is unmezzable.  You then need to switch 
targets, but, the original mob is now unmezzable as well, if it has 
darkness cast on it.  It happens, I sometimes use DoTs on mobs in xp 
groups, only to be embarrassed by being the one who is breaking the mez.  
In general, I just don't use DoTs anymore, except when soloing, or when 
there will be no mezzing anyway.
