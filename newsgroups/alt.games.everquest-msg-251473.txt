All graphics are done by the client. I don't think the server knows
anything more than your loc and orientation and those are only
periodically updated (everyone has seen the spinning player before I
am sure). The client also predicts where things are ahead of time to
present the image of constant updates without actually getting them.
Constantly updating information leads to what's known as rubberbanding
and other annoying effects caused by regular internet lag.

A few other little things are clientside as well. Most is serverside.
Anything that has a computational result is serverside. That plays to
a supercomputer's strength, I believe. All mob and world behavior (and
that includes things controlled by invisible mob-like entities like
weather, traps, death, etc) is serverside.

The PC is doing little more than running the pretty graphics. The base
game of EQ hasn't really changed, and I could run two windows of it on
my old celeron 500 until the graphics changed.
