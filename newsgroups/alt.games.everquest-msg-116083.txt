In general, I'd say the customary cost for a port is 10p. Even a low level
character can scrape together 10p... heck kill two wisps and sell the loot.
10p is high enough to say "I respect the time and mana you will have to
spend on this".

> what is considered customary for SoW?  other buffs?

Back when I was 14th (the level druids get SoW) I was happy if somone gave
me 1p for a SoW. Remember that at 14th for a non-uber-twinked Druid, Sow is
not insignificant in mana costs. Neither is 1pp. At 14th level, getting 1pp
for every SoW will get you the money you need for that level. Occasionally
someone would ask for a SoW and I would cast it on them and they'd give me
10-20pp... that made my day... and made it easier for me to accept those
that got their SoW and ran away without even a thanks.

Bah, if I cast a buff on you without you asking, I don't expect anything in
return. I commented in an earlier thread about the "secret society" of those
who can SoW and Enchanters. I'll often be sitting around doing not much and
suddenly BANG I have clarity cast on me. I always find that person and SoW
them if possible. Likewise, If I see an enchanter I'll cast SoW (or SoE) on
them. If they respond with Clarity/Breeze, that's fine... if not... that's
fine too. They didn't ask for the buff, I don't expect a reward.

> But if I am seeking a buff, what is customary to donate??

Depends upon the buff. Most lower level buffs, 1pp would be fine. If you
want a buff that would take as much mana as a port... maybe 5pp. If you want
so may buffs they run off the screen, expect to pay more.

I'm often asked while I am in freeport to cast Wolf-form upon someone who is
KoS in town so they can do a quest requiring better faction. I'm usually
glad to do this for free. On the flipside, If I'm not just goofing off and
actually doing something and someone asks me for Group Skin Like Nature,
Regeneration, Wolf-form, Levitate, and a Damage Shield... well, why should
I? That's about 1500mana I'd spend... just to Power level someone I don't
know.
