If you haven't noticed what Sony did to enchanters, you're probably
somewhat new to the game.  If you enjoy EQ as a lvl 67 Enchanter, you
must like being a traveling buff-bot.  Each their own.  I like to be a
little more active in games myself.

For more info on what Sony did to Enchanters, just check out any of
the Enchanter forums.  Or click on one of the links I have listed
below.   If you go to the Everquest forums, you'll have to change the
view options to show 1 star posts, since Sony quickly labels anything
negative with a one star rating so most people won't see them.
