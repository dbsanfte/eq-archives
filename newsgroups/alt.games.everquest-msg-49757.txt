Dark Age of Camelot is my recomendation.  EQ is a fantastic game (I don't
know about UO since I never played it), but since it was the first big name
3D MMORPG, there were a few mistakes and flaws in its design.  DAoC did an
excellent job of learning from EQ's mistakes.

I imagine that Star Wars Galaxies will be the end all be all MMORPG if you
like the genre, but that is still a long way off.  Asheron's Call is a
decent game, but it never took off like the other two, EQ and UO, and I had
a hard time relating to its unprecidented fantasy backdrop.  Stay away from
Anarchy Online at all costs.  That game turned out to be a real turd.

Best Regards
