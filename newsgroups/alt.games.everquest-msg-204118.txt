I can't find any way to reply to this :P

Actually, it's very easy to justify: run a parse of a decent 2 hander vs. 
swiftwind and a decent 1 hander.  I can tell you offhand that with SoV 
(68% haste) and an RBG (27% haste), Windblade (50/44) easily outdamages 
Swiftwind (13/21, 40% haste, but only 32% actually counts since I hit my 
haste cap at 100% or so) and a Blackened Acrylia Blade (14/22).  With 
Shaman haste (figure Celerity for argument, which is 50% haste), the gap 
gets closer, but a good 2 hander will still win.

I really found the ranger epic to be incredibly easy.  The most highly 
contested mob is VSR, and he's easily a 1 group encounter.  The only 
difficult part is getting that !@#$ing SEoC for Earthcaller, and only 
then because SOE decided to !@#$ the rangers by making it an insanely 
rare drop in a raid-only zone (is probably better with new hate).

I forgot: you're female.  This should have come as a given *ducks*

See previous comment ;)

Yeah, this pretty much explains your decision, and with this info I can 
easily see why you're choosing to go the way you are.  I still wouldn't 
buy headshot though.  Actually, instead of looking at offensive melee 
AAs, you might look into defensive AAs (combat avoidance, combat 
stability, natural durability, etc) that will turn you into more of a 
tank than a DDer for the time being.  Really, once he gets torpor, you're 
going to want to switch to bow as quickly as possibly, but the defensive 
AAs will still help you out a bit there.

Definitely have fingers crossed here.  On a side note: just how bad is 
the KSing when it comes to stormfeather?  He was up for about 5 minutes 
when I took him down, and nobody even showed up.  Did I get lucky?  Is 
Karana more well behaved than other servers?

PS: just kidding about the female/(lack of) logic thing, please don't 
hurt me!
