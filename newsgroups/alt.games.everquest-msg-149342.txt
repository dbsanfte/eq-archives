Gear is not "all important" for a monk (at least not like it is for a
warrior). I played through 53 levels as a "Ghetto Monk" (mostly cured
silk and hand-to-hand) before I retired and moved to the FV server.
You are not a "tank" so I would recommend you focus on damage output
and haste first. Especially if your plan is to group with other guild
members. Look for "old school" gear. Most of it is incredibly cheap
now. You don't have to be a "Fungi-Monk" with top-gear to have fun and
be effective. 

If I was you I would start with the following.....

Haste = FBSS, SCHW, *Silver Belt of Contention
*Similar to FBSS with stats and AC....Rare drop in Kael,. so prob not
an option

Weapons
1HB (Fighting Baton, Trance Stick, Cane of Tranquil, Jade Mace, ect)
H2H (Polished Steel Ulaks-magic 9/27 with STA and HPs, Fireclaw Tallon
(75pt DD proccess at 37), basically anything with a ratio better than
your base H2H for your level)
2HB (Adamantine Bo Stick, Bamboo Bo, etc)

Armor
Netted Kelp (decent AC and +sta on most pieces)
Wu's (Better than cured silk and fairly cheap now)
All/All pieces that are light and have good AC (Azure Sleeves for
example)

2x 6/65 rings
2x Cougar Claw or Orc Fang earrings

Check out some of the magelo profiles at www.monkly-business.com and
you will get a good idea of what monks are wearing today before you go
shopping.
