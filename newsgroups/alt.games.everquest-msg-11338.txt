I can only play the game in 640 x 480 windowed mode since last patch. If I
try to play in full screen or any other mode it drops out to desktop.I have
re-run the thorough file check, Optional patch, Kunark patch and Velious
patch and also have the latest video drivers. I have tried this on both my
PC's and have the same problem. I have also updated my virus scanners and
found no known viruses.

Any other help or advise will be appreciated as the game really sucks trying
to play in 640 x 480 mode.

My system configs are as follows:

1)    Pentium 3  933  256m ram
        Riva TNT2 card (latest drivers)

2)    Pentium 3   600    192m ram
        Voodoo 3 card (latest drivers)
