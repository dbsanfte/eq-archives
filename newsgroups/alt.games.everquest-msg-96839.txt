Yes there is...

GM Event mobs are 'regular' in that they actually /con at their real
level... I guess whoever sets the event up asks the programmers for "a bunch
of lvl 20 skellies" and that's what they get.

Normal game mobs are sometimes 'Encounter Driven' in their difficulty...
meaing that they /con at the level of experience given, which is not the
same as their 'true fighting level' As an example, most Guards are 'under
cons' to reduce their attractivness to people wanting fast XP... There's no
point soloing guards if they're fighting 5 or more levels above what they're
worth in XP. Some 'pivotal' NPCs/Mobs are also set to /con even to a lvl 20,
but actually need a group of 20s to kill them (encouraging people to group
when performing quests, etc...) and this is also supposed to discourage a
high level character that just wanders past from slapping him down for cheap
experience.

So that Werewolf in WK that regularly hands you your ass IS more dangerous
than his /con and XP reward would indicate... mainly because the loot he
drops is used in some nice mid-level quests (werewolf talon gives a nice
Monk usable glove that's better than the Gem Encrusted you can get camping
Tesh Mac Gnolls outside Splitpaw... a mid/high 20s camp)
