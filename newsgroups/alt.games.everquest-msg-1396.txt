Ya know, I got to thinking about this last night on the way home from work
(I live 50 minutes away...I think and sing a lot :) ).

Let's say a level 15 needs to kill 50 blue critters to level to 16.

That's 50 critters, whether he's hitting them fast or slow.  Tossing a haste
buff on him won't speed up his ability to gain skill...whether or not he's
hastened he's still going to have to land, say, 2000 blows.   Haste will
only make the time needed for those blows noticeably shorter than another
level 15 without haste.  Two thousand blows slow or fast...makes no
difference in skill increases.

Now, DEX and skill increases...dunno.  I don't know what increases the
chance of skill increases (I've never really cared).  If you say DEX does,
I'll take your word for it.  That's certainly a worthwhile buff if that's
the case.
