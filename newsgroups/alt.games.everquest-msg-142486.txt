Zland = weakest first brood mob.

Reason they would sell...  8 months ago my guild was doing ST, we didnt
however have many keys.
We still kill first broods now (last 1 was like 2 days ago).. in the past 8+
months we have obtained around 100 ST keys.

If you werent at the top of the list though, it meant a huge wait.  Some
people still don't have an ST key now.

Another example.. you join your servers resident uber guild, from out of
nowhere.  You miss out on things such as Cazics halo (clerics) and Sleepers
keys, because your guild has long surpassed these mobs, and won't ever go
back to them.   Unless your there as the guild is growing, these things just
don't happen
