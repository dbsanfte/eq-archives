For all the above reasons, and notwithstanding the growing consensus 
otherwise, I agree completely. LDoN is actually what pulled me back into the 
game at a time when I was trying for my third time to like the game. With 
the band of regulars that I met, and the experience and gear that I was able 
to accumulate in small, digestible chunks, I was able to take Winterfury 
from a hapless, soloing 34 Shaman to an e-flagged, time-enabled 200-AA, GoD 
fearing Elder Prophet. Not sure I would have stayed the course without that 
expansion.
