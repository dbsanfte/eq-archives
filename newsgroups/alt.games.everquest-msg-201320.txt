> Why does this spell or any spell overwrite slot 3?

    Spells only overwrite/bounce with other spells if they share the same
effect in the same slot. The effect in slot 3 for Temperance is "Increase HP
when cast by 800" according to Lucy (
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3692&source=Live ). This is an instant
effect (happens at moment of spell resolution and at no other time), and
thus cannot conflict with anything. If you ever have questions about
possible spell conflicts, a quick visit to Lucy will make some of it clear.
(Some of the stacking information on Lucy is off, like when it talks about
worn effects or comparison conditions, but by and large it's right.)

> whats in slot 3 before I cast?

    No, as the slot 3 effect doesn't conflict with anything. However,
Temperance could overwrite druid buffs or mage buffs that have useful
secondary components like HP and mana regen, so it might be wise to ask if
people want it first. Same as you have to do with Resolution or Shield of
Words now.
