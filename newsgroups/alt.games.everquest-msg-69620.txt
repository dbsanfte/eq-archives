I run (and have always run for EQ) a P3 450, TnT2 32 meg video card, and
256 megs of ram.

The moon is nearly unplayable for me. I have graphics turned down to low
resolution, I bring my clip plane in so far that I feel like I have
cataracts, and I have all models (except the vah shir, who I would turn off
if I could) on old world. In addition to the performance increase, most of
them look better.

The sad thing, is that my machine now hurts greatly even in old zones.
Zoning can take as much as 5 minutes now (it never went above 1 minute
pre-luclin unless my modem crashed) regardless of zone. I also get quite a
lot of chopiness, particularly when turning around.

One of the first things I do when I log in is open my spellbook so the game
can load THAT into memory. The first time I open the spellbook when I log
in takes a good 20 seconds. Normal after that.
