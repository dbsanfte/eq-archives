Before y'all start with the "Can I have your stuff" comments, I'm
finally going to officially throw my voice in the EQ/Verant is pissing
me off corner.  As the login server seems to be down now (4:30pm CST),
I went to the EQ website to see what was going on.  No, nothing on the
network status page about server issues, but I noticed a link I hadn't
noticed before on the navigation bar.  Rate Increase.  Apparently 4/25
they're upping the monthly cost to $12.95.

Now, I make that 3 extra dollars in about 5 minutes of work, and it
isn't going to break the bank, but considering I found out that
they're raising their rates when I went to the site to see why they
were down is enough to frustrate me.

Then again, maybe if they raise their rates they can afford whatever
is needed to keep the login server up and running.

And yes, if I do end up leaving for this, you can have my stuff. 
Gotta warn ya, though, I'm the most untwinked level 47 monk I've run
across.  I really have to quit only wearing/wielding equipment I get
myself.

Just for reference, how much is DAoC, AO, UO, and AC a month?  Do I
even have a right to balk at the price?

Thanks,

I can't remember my 30th level Cleric's name...how sad is that???
