Random rusties are hardly worth your while, make a point of buying or
looting yourself several Rusty Two Handers (or better yet Rusty
Halberds)  At under 5gp each, they turn lowbie pets into 20 damage
per swing slammers... the equivalent of a 10/30 weapon in your hands.

Better yet, hang on to the high damage crap weapons your main loots,
and twink the pets with -that-... remember, the posted delay is ignored,
your pet will act as though the weapon had a 30 delay, yet use the
damage rating of the weapon.  Course now you are looking at junk you
could sell to vendors for 15pp or so, so you might think twice about
throwing it away on a twink's pet...
