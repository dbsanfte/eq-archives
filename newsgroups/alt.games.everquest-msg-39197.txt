I think your name is *the* most important thing about your character.  It is
the only thing that you have that distinguishes you from all the other
clones.  Skills and stats can be changed and upgraded till everyone is
equal.  Almost none of the equipment you can gather will make you stand out.
But that name can show some imagination and character.
