And this assclown is exactly the reason again.  "My 3733T UbEr tOoNS' are so 
much better than joo!" attitude is what is killing EQ.  People like you and 
Dark Tyger with your incessant whining about eula's and spamming.

Asshole....I have an account I am never going to play again. I would assume 
it not go to waste. I would like someone who would enjoy playing it to have 
it, either outright, trade, or whatever.  That would be between myself and 
whoever would like it.  So piss off out of this thread, and let someone who 
would like to play a perma-parked account answer to it.  If noone does, then 
fine.

Save your bitching and whining for one of the myriad of bots that auto post 
to this group.
