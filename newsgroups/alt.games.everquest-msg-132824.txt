Definitely a lack of consensus.  I disagree completely.  I've seen some 
data, even, somewhere on eqtraders forums that showed a few diferent 
people training skills over quite long ranges, and then adding up total 
numer of successes with skill ups and failures with skill ups, and 
comparing that with total successes and failures.  The numbers were in the 
ballpark of the same ratio.  Then there were about 50 gazillion posts 
decaring the difference in ratios to be proof that it's more common one 
way or the other, or that it doesn't matter.  But -my- interpretation of 
the data is that skill up and success/failure are unrelated.

}That being said, there is no real consensus on this, so your guess is as
}good as anyone elses.

No! My guess is better! Dang it! Listen to me! :)
