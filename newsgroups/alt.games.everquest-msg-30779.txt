Good description (the whole thing, most of which I've snipped for
space reasons).

In addition, at the same time that the class exp penalties
were removed, the grouping *bonus* was increased, to the point
where a full group of six people will get 20% more exp per kill
"out of thin air" just for being grouped.  I forget the group
bonus for smaller groups, but it's there as well.
