A bug that, as of yet, hasn't been fixed.  Another bug you might notice is
that, when you change your default language from Common Language, sometimes
when you zone, the language changes to some other random one.

Another good one. Change your clipping plane to zero then restart. When you
do, it will still be set to zero, however, you will actually be at 100. You
will have to slide the bar up, then back down to get zero again.
