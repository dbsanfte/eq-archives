Have been on EQ for awhile now and thought id make a monk and try him
out..got him to 2nd level at freeport then in middle of a fight i discovered
he no longer attacks with punches only kicks..I can put     him in combat
mode standing right next to  a targetted creature and unless i kick he
doesnt punch..anyone else run into this..and is there a remedy for it..
Thanks in advance.
