We were there finishing off a guildie's heritage quest for the Bone Bladed 
Claymore (BBC). The final mob is triggered right there at the top of the 
stairs leading to the Atrium.

And you're welcome for the cure. My Cure Noxious has been pretty handy for 
curing the early manifestations of the Plague, but recent strains are 
proving more resistant and it's not working as reliably anymore. Also, it 
lasts longer now. This plague is getting worse every day ...
