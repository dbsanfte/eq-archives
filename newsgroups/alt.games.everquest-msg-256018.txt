Please!  Take a deep breath.  You sound just like my BF when a KSer shows up: 
yelling at the offender, throwing a big fit, followed by swearing at the guy,
followed by KSing him back (thereby breaking the rules himself), ending with a
horrible headache and a ruined evening.  
When *I'm* confronted by a KSer, I change zones.  End of problem.  If the
offender has a guild I most certainly send a well written e-mail to the head of
their guild.  /ignore is your friend!
Seriously, KSers suck.  Suck bad.  Everyone knows it.  It isn't fair, but
that's life.  There *are* losers playing this game.  If you let them get to you
then they win.
