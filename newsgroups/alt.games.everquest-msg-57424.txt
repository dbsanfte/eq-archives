I can't believe an orc MPC can train the Emporer to the zone, he runs
just as fast, hits hard, all the other NPC orcs will frenzy on you... thats
quite a run.  And even if you succede, you can't zone out, so you just
have to stand there and die, there's no way to ditch aggro as an MPC.
Since I was unable to get in to Crush in 100 tries, if I -did- finally get into
an interesting zone, I sure wouldn't be throwing that MPC away on
such an asinine project.

Then again, what I really enjoyed was convincing other players that
I was on their side, and fighting alongside them.

No reprisal, yes, but you sure get ganked, and since 95% of all MPC
respawns are quite lame, you are looking at a whole heap of boring
camp camp camp to get back to an interesting zone.
