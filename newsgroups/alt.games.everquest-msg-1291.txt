This is possibly a stupid question, but in perusing some of the local
uberguild websites and admiring the screenshots of mobs and locales that I
will most likely never see, I noticed that some of them have the text labels
on their hotkeys in various colors.  I've tried searching through archived
patch messages and such, but can't find out how to do this.  Someone please
enlighten me?
