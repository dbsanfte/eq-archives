STR is more important than either AGI or DEX, but for one simple reason:

STR has a direct effect on a rogue's most important stat, ATK.

DEX is ok for procs and practicing pickpocket or pick locks, but not much
else.  AGI _does_ actually have a small impact on armor class, but then
again, a rogue that is doing his job most of the time should not be getting
hit a lot.  This holds for "normal" exp grinding as well as raid situations
(I say normal because rogue/shaman is a good exp combo, but not exactly
a "normal" grind groupage).

HPS are also important, but it is hard to find many big hp items that a
rogue
can use that shouldn't end up with a warrior or sk/paly getting them first.

Get AGI/DEX over 76.  Period.  That's all you need, for an extra 5 minutes
to
learn Riposte to max skill doesn't hurt anything in the long run.

Get STA above 101.  That way you never slow down on a long fight or long
set of fights that don't offer a break in action.  STA getting higher is
also nice
for increasing hps, but then again, hp gain for rogues per point of STA
isn't
exactly mind blowing.

Get STR up as high as you can get it without sacrificing AC or another vital
stat (like lowering AGI below 75 or STA to 99, etc).  The main reason for
this
is that the ONE thing rogues do is damage, and higher STR directly effects
your ATK numbers.  You get a higher set of max damage numbers from the
RNG, as well as hitting more often in the higher range of that RNG groupage.
It also allows you to hit higher level mobs more often, as well as hitting
for
nearer-to-max damage on blue and lower mobs.

AC is king, unless you need to sacrifice AC for haste.  Or direct ATK
(although
it's easier to find good haste than anything with a direct buff to the ATK
rating).
Getting AC above 1250 even as a 60 rogue isn't worth it, but getting haste
from 21% to 41% is a big improvement on damage output.

I'd rank 'em as such:

AC*
STR/HPS (tie)
AGI
DEX
all others

*only thing to sacrifice AC for is either better haste or something with a
direct
ATK buff, and the ATK buff only if it's something that must be worn
constantly.
