A) I'd need a key, which I'm not sure I can pull off without a tracker, 
that zone is huge and mages are really bad about adds.  Most common 
solution to adds; die, come back with invis and dry loot.

B) most people of seb level don't seem to have seb keys these days; by 
now you can do POP for exp and LDoN for loot, and don't have to bother 
finding a tracker and doing the five minutes worth of work to get into 
seb.

C) I remember seb as a zone of massive overpulls, don't see how I could 
do it solo, but your list of partners makes some sense; people who can 
deal with adds.  That being the case though, why necro best?  No lull to 
pull with.  Why bard not on the list?  Has CC and lull like the chanter. 
  And shaman but not cleric?  Hows the shaman going to deal with the 
adds, root and back off right?  In which case the cleric can do the same 
plus has lull to hopefully prevent them.  Am I thinking along different 
lines here?

Tried velks, I can indeed solo the mobs here... but as you suspect, I 
have a hard time single pulling them, and can't handle two.  With my 44 
shaman partner we did pretty well here, though, as she was able to stick 
root to split, and once we had spider or gargoyle pair split they 
spawned one at a time and we didn't have to keep doing it.

POJ worked well with someone high enough level to single pull to exit, 
but exp wasn't any too good there because the pull times were long; we 
couldn't fight closer to the pull area because I was low enough to get 
lots of aggro fighting out there.  POJ death row with a power group was 
fantastic exp and loot... but its apparantly evercamped and besides, 
getting a slot in a higher level group as a mere 52 mage doesn't always 
happen.

CoM is interesting, again seems tricky without a partner to get singles, 
but with the shaman we did pretty well.  Its odd to see it changed, as 
my own shaman did several levels there getting pieces for his epic.

I don't see how I can do the Hole, although I did try several times; the 
mobs are in pairs opposite each other, and refuse to play nice and both 
go on my pet.  If I could get both to get on my pet and stay, I could 
kill one fast and the other slow, and split the pairs using tons of mana 
  to heal, then subsequently I think it would be a good camp indeed. 
Every time I tried, though, on pulling one of the pair would get on me, 
and I'd have to try and brush it off, once it wouldnt' leave me at all, 
and the other two times it turned back around after a bit and went for 
me anyway.  I either need more skill, another level, or someone to come 
help me do the initial split.
