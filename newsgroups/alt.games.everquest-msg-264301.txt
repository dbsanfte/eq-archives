Yahoo is one of them due to the incredible ease with which you can get
an account there.

It nails the yahoo servers with the spam that their policies are
helping.


I lost count of the number of SPAM reports I sent yahoo, and the _best_
you could hope for was that they would cancel
SpammingAsshole321@yahoo.com .
Of course the spammer would just make SpammingAsshole322@yahoo.com
immediately and continue on as though nothing had happened. 

While a lot of spam is sent through unsecured servers (a lot in korean
public schools), they almost always use yahoo, hotmail or one of the
other freebie anonymous mail services as the contact address.

Yahoo, hotmail etc have shown no inclination to stop this.

Yahoo in particular would reply saying "the spam wasn't sent through us,
why are you telling us about it" when the contact address the spammer
used to receive replies was at yahoo and they were CC'd the spam
complaint.

This is one of the reasons that except for specific addresses on my
whitelist, I don't accept ANY mail at all from yahoo, hotmail, lycos,
netscape, AOL or any other free-email service that sends me spam.

I filter brutally though.  
Spam gets in - blacklist that specific address and file spam report.
On the 3rd spam from the same domain - unfilter the specific addresses
and blacklist the domain.

As long as there are "free" email services that don't require actual
proof of identity, there will be spammers using them.

As long as it's LEGAL to spam, there will be spammers.
