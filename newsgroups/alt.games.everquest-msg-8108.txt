This is coming in the next expansion, IIRC.

One I'd add: We need a way to target a groupmate's pet with a
keystroke. Pets are notoriously hard to click on, especially
in combat. We have F1-F6 for targetting groupmates, why not
Alt-F1 through Alt-F6 for their pets? (Or are those keys bound
already? If so substitute Shift, Ctrl, or some combination thereof.)
