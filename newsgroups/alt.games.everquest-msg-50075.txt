Like Jazz said, your god MUST be Brell.

If your god is Brell, you will NOT be attacked by anything except ratmen,
undead, and Yael (or whatever the big guy is called).

Ratmen and undead DO NOT SEE THROUGH SNEAK/HIDE.   To sneak/hide, stand
still, wait for a successful sneak message, then wait for a successful hide
message.

Since you speak French, perhaps you misunderstand Verant's humor.  If you
get the message:
"You are as quiet as a herd of elephants" that means you have FAILED.  You
must see a message about being "as quiet as a cat stalking its prey."   I
think the hide message is not confusing at all.
