Really? So (to use an example from this very thread) you'd *say*;

EHN AY ES AY rather than "NASA"?
ES OH DOUBLE-YOO rather than "SoW"?

The very same thing you and I do on a daily basis.

>Which means they're trying to look what they think is "cool".

Go back and study logic some more, DT. Conforming to society's
standards (including your peer group) isn't necessarily done to look
"cool". By definition, if the majority were "cool", then "cool" would
lose all meaning. The more people who are "cool" in a particular way,
the less that particular mannerism etc is *cool*... time to move on to
the next "cool" thing.

Preaching? Self-righteous? You're confusing those things with reasoned
debate. Silly boy.

>against "ty"? 

I came out against "ty"? Did I really? I stated what my initial
reaction was on recieving "ty" as a means of appreciation. I then said
that I understood this was more than likely a normal expression of his
gratitude. 

I am open minded enough to understand that my opinions are not
necessarily 100% correct and when evidence comes along which doesn't
correlate to my view of the world... I change my view of the world. 

You really should try it some time.

>Which side of the debate are you on?

There is no black and white, DT, you fuckwit. There are only shades of
grey. I am not on any *side*. You are the sheep here, not I.
