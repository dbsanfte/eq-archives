I don't get what this logic has to do with anything, or at least my point 
that Sony is ponying up to the trough once again. 

If you read the post, you'd see I'm NOT buying it, not even tempted to, 
least not till I'm higher level.  And I have no problem with their right 
to do whatever they choose. 

But if you think they're interested more in improving the experience for 
the customers who've already paid large amounts of money for Everquest, 
and continue to pay for it, and not in milking every last dime they can 
out of the people who have already richly lined Sony's coffers, I've got 
a bridge I'd like to sell you.  

They have the right to do it, no doubt.  And EQ is a great game, and one 
I'll probably continue playing.  But I left the first time because I felt 
woefully out of place because I only paid $50 once, for the orginal game, 
not the two expansion packs that were out at the time. And I wouldn't 
justify paying another 30-40 dollars, especially when I was already 
paying $9.95 each month.   Looks like this will be happening again, down 
the road..
