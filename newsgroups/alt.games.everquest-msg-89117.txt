I took part in this one on the karana server.

Some gnome opened up a portal that was spawning regular zombies and skels in
the undead ring where Grimrot spawns.

Anyway, everyone was killing them, it was hilarious, I have never seen a pile
of bodies that high :)

When I looked up, I saw a mob called "A Dark Portal", so my guild leader (hey
Thorre!) and I started beating on this thing.  I got some dark mail gloves
(AC10, Dex5, Mana50) for my troubles, got my named mentioned (which was more of
a thrill for my level 20 :).

I heard there were events in FP:E, but never got there to see.
