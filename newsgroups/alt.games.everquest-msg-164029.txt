Hi, Immune to Mez tags.

Not every group needs/has/wants 2 tanks, but hey what the fuck, might as
well have an extra exp sponge because we "might" get an add.

One of my most successful regular groups doesn't even have a (PC) tank.  Me
charming a wolf in Kael for DPS, enchanter DC Klaggan Iceshard. Kael Arena
cleared, but stuff is spread out enough that I can single pull them.  We
could kill PoZ, but for the fact that we have no way of splitting them (no
thx for me kiting them around).

No warrior with half an ale stained brain cell would use aggressive in 99%
of situations, wizards don't have higher SUSTAINED DPS, the new pets I could
believe if I saw a log.
