I guess you can broadly use ethics and morals in a broad sense of the term
and apply it to everything.  Personally I wouldn't use them in such a broad
use.  Ethics should be applied to things that truly matter, like Murdering
and lying.  Maybe Ethical dating, like not stealing thy neighbor's girl
friend.  But when it comes to gaming, beyond maybe ethical killing ( no kill
stealing ), your stretching the use as far as I'm concerned.

Whether you twink or not, no one really cares all that much.  If you twink
and group with others, you actually help your group out more if your
twinked, because you become more effective, and your group earns exp faster
by you being a part of it.  All my 20th levels are twinked and proud to be
twinked, and although I know others twink more effectively, I am satisfied
with my twinking ability.  I think that it does get a bit rediculous when
you give a newbie char something a 60th level would be proud to use, but
beyond rediculous twinking I think it is definitely useful and helpful.
Many an items has been sold because someone wanted to twink.  If it helps
the economy, all the more important for twinking to be both Moral and
Respectable.
