And yet, if knights are inherently worse at tanking (all aspects of it) like
you seem to want to make us, nobody will want them in groups.
I hate to repeat what I said in a previous post but Kunark might have been a
great time for warriors/clerics/enchanters...but it wasn't much good, balance
wise, for everyone else. And your arguements seem to imply that *that* is the
sort of 'balance' SOE should be aiming for - a return to the 'Holy Trinity'

However, I get the feeling that we won't agree on this, so this'll be the last
time I make a comment like that. =)
