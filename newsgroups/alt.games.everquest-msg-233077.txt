Not actually true ... the graphics sub-system does play an important
part in the equation.  There is no doubt that the CPU and memory bus
are also major players in the mix but the graphics are important.

By looking down you are forcing less use of the memory and cpu cycles
because your system is drawing fewer pixels.  So it is quicker for some
systems to look down in memory intensive areas.  Although most modern
graphics cards have their own GPU they do draw on other system
resources.

Of course if you have a fast system anyway this is moot.  But for those
stuggling with mid to low end systems looking down will definately help.
