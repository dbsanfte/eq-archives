YAY

- Bankers no longer take items - In order to help prevent people from losing
items by giving them to their banker instead of putting them into their
bank, players can no longer attempt to trade with bankers. A message will
tell you to right-click the banker if you wish use your bank.
=======

done that a few times,  the freeport bankers seem to enjoy the look of Centi
longswords
======

- Combining Stacks of items - Attempting to combine stacked items in a
container will no longer work. The items must be separated first. This
change will prevent items from being lost due to accidentally combining with
them stacked. A dialogue will pop up, warning the player to separate the
objects.
=======
learned  my lesson  when i combined a whole stack of velium bars with 1 fire
opal =\

=====

- NPCs returning bags empty - NPCs that return items that they do not need
were returning all containers empty, regardless of what was inside the
container. NPCs that refuse unusable items will now also return bags with
their contents intact.

- NPCs returning multiple items - If a character gave an NPC multiples of
the same item, the NPC would only give back one of them if he did not want
them. We have fixed this so that now those items will be returned. Such
items will be stacked on your cursor. Just click the item that is on your
cursor into your inventory and the next one will appear on your cursor. Keep
clicking them into your inventory until you have them all back. BE WARNED
that any of these items that you have not returned to your inventory will be
lost if you zone or go linkdead before you get them back into your
inventory.

im glad to see they have fixed these finally being such  common mistake's
