First and foremost question. When you created the halfling rogue, did
you make him a Brell worshipper? If not, then delete character and start
over. That's a critical part of the formula. I have a lvl one, Brell
worshipping, halfling rogue parked in the Hole currently. I have walked
next to numerous elementals without bothering to sneak/hide. They con
scowling, but do not attack. The golems con dubious, and so also don't
attack.  The pesky fliers and ratman warriors con badly and will attack,
but they don't see through the sneak/hide. (At least they haven't on me
yet.)
