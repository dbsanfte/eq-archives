That's clever, actually. MAN, this thread is like quicksand. Much as
you try not to get involved, it just sucks you in. So, here is my 2cp
worth:

MY OPINION is that EQ is meant to be played in the spirit of RP.
Everything about it is geared to be and RPG. Therefore, I guess it
should be expected that people not use silly names (e.g. Bign Nastee,
Keebler or such). I feel that names such as those DO detract from the
game.

For slightly different reasons, I agree with the policy of not
allowing names from literature, mainly because no Legolass or
Legellaas I have seen is ever playing the role of Legolas from LoTR.
If you want to roleplay Bilbo Baggins, by all means, but don't select
that name because you aren't clever enough to think of anything else
and then run around begging, "SoW plz, I want phat l3wtz!"  That crap
SHOULD be prohibited. Problem is, how would anyone ever police that?

It's a game. Play it in the spirit in which it was created to be
played. Otherwise you're just diminishing it for others when you'd be
better served playing Sims online or something.
