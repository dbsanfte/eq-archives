I tihnk we are going to have to agree to disagree - I think the flaw was
obvious even to designers at the time (it was an immediate thought to me
at the time and I had to be convinced by game desiging friends that it was

enough about at the time to indicate this would get jumped all over - you
presumably either don't or that the effect was not significant enough...
