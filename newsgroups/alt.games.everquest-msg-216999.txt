Melee heavy groups have always been a perfectly viable method of killing
stuff in the 40's.  I've found that the best DL groups by far are 4 x
melee, 1 x slower/haster, 1 x healer.

Nothing new to this format in LDoN, it's always been good.  If you can
control the pulls then in the 40's, generally, it's one of the most
efficient methods of killing stuff there is.

Not the best, there is no 'best', just another option.
