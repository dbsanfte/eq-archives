Okay, so that makes you happy.   Why?

Now that they've given you that information, what are you going
to do with it?   Only the person being healed and the healer is
supposed to see the message, as I read the change, anyway.  Do
either the healer or healee care?

At least if it was a general broadcast (like critical damage), you
could get a feel for what other heals being done are.  (I get SO
tired of seeing "Soandso feels much better.")   Or at least show
the other warrior why he's not tanking. ;)    But if the message
is just shown to the healer and healee, I see this as just spam.
And I'm really looking forward to getting on and seeing how a
Celestial Heal spams me...
