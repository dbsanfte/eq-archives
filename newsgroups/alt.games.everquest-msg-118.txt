For my Barbarian Rogue, I just made Hide and Sneak hotbuttons and just kept
hitting them constantly, like I do my Sense Heading button, till they're
maxed.

If you successfully Hide, you have to hit the button each time to undo the
Hide, so you can click it again to attempt the skill point build-up.  You
also have to stand still to Hide, unless you are successfully Sneaking
first.  Your Hide skill point increase is based on per-attempt to Hide, not
based on how long you are Hiding.

For Sneak, it doesn't matter if you are moving or still.  But it also is a
per-attempt, not how long you're sneaking around (unlike Swimming, where the
longer you swim, the more likely your skill is to go up.)
