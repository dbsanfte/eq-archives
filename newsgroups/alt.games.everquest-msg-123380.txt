Here's how this works.  Reply to this post with a good description of
a bug you found.  Everyone who reads the replies of this thread copy
paste print (or memorize) and submit a similar (but not verbatim) bug
report at your next convenience.  The objective here is that Verant
will see more of these /bug's from many different users and hopefully
speed up repairs.



My bug report (Druzzil Ro Server):  Morton Sayer's house in QH has a
bugged door.  It refuses to open, but it does not require a key.  This
bug breaks the gnollslayer quest because the Baby Joseph Sayer Doll
which you get from Lord Elgnub must be turned into Sayer.  This is not
possible unless the door is fixed.  Thanks.
