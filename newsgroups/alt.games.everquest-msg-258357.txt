Let me just start off by saying thank you to everyone in this thread.  I am
learning a lot!  This is replying to nothing specifically, so please, pretty
please, forgive the top-posting. :)  I wrote more real text below...

In my limited experience, I'd have to say that Chuck's point is valid.  Sorry
brian/Highmark, but it seems like half the clerics I've grouped with have a
hotkey to spam "Ack!  Get it off me now!" to the rest of the group.  What's a
dumb troll beastlord supposed to think?  Duh ... Clerics must be fragile and
need protecting.  Okie dokie, offtanking...  Clearly, it seems to depend on the
player of the cleric.  Oh, but I have to read the *people* too, not just learn
good tactics for my class and the current group composition?  *grumble* :)  In
fairness, in my last group, with 2 casters, they held down adds pretty well and
didn't scream when I just stuck on the MT's target.  I *did* switch targets
once to nail the healer first, and apparently that was a good call.

For what it's worth, at level 45 on Bristlebane, most of the enchanters I've
met have been on the ball, although that hasn't been very many.  I haven't yet
noticed much of an "idiot factor" by class, but I have learned to be wary of
halflings. :)  Given that I'm the one asking for advice in this thread, you can
decide for yourself whether my opinion is worth anything...  

Slowly, I'm learning.  Lately, I've been the leader of most my my LDON groups. 
Not because I'm particularly brighter than those around me, but I'm the only
one willing to chase down 5 other warm bodies to get the job done and herd cats
to get things organized.  I had one group implode the other night because 3
separate people refused to join the three of us already there because the group
wasn't already formed and ready to go right away.  Sigh...  Anyway, after we
sort out who will be MT and puller, we play hot potato with who has to be ML
(master looter).  That's usually me, since I figure beastlord mana is probably
the least valuable.  Heck, I'm finally 45, meaning I can get KEI, but I have no
idea how I would spend it all, if I did!  I suppose I could chain-cast my
20-levels-late shaman nukes...  I've also started discussing crowd control
strategies (OK, we have 2 pallies, 2 beastlords, a druid and a necro ... I see
lots of off-tanking?  Thankfully, the pulling MT paladin in that group brought
back mostly singles.), at least in a rudimentary sense.

Hey, I'm trying!
