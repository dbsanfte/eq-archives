http://www.m-w.com/ has a definition for murder that seems to confirm
your position:

The crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice
aforethought.

Still, capital punishment seems like a dangerous game for Christians
to play: A lot of innocent people have been put to death for crimes
they didn't commit.

What does the Bible say about that scenario (if anything)?
