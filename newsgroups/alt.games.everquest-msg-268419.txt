    I define by content level. On Quellious, we have: one Anguish guild, one 
guild one raid away from Anguish, one Tacvi guild alliance, one Australian 
Txevu guild, one guild that was Time-capable but has fallen just below that, 
another guild just in Time, two elemental guilds missing Rathe/Coir, and a 
Time-level alliance that seems to have lost a lot of members. Those are all 
the guilds that I, as someone in an Anguish guild, would look at as possible 
recruitment sources. Individuals from outside those guilds could come to us 
and recruit, but I wouldn't go out looking for them because I wouldn't even 
know where to look for them.

    Below 40% in our guild and you're on loot probation; below 20% and your 
head goes on the chopping block. Our average might be higher because of 
that, but it won't be terribly higher.

    You're also top-heavy - always have been. I can still go to places like 
Dreadlands and find it semi-crowded. Makes a big difference when looking to 
recruit.

    Our recruits won't be doing one group MPG trials anytime soon. Rift 
trash is exactly that - trash. 125/130 HP gear with foci that are replaced 
by Time loot (like the pet earring in Rifts). The only good stuff in Rifts 
is the augs, because there aren't augs in Time.

    I think they're all 65, 10% decline. Even with that, they beat out Qvic 
because the person doing Time will get that focus a lot sooner than if they 
were just doing Qvic. Don't get me wrong, we'll be doing Qvic on days when 
we don't do Time - but Time is the most important place for gearing folks 
up.

> Needless to say most of the important foci
> are on qvic armour.

    No, they aren't. Look at the cleric Qvic armour: you get a healing focus 
(single target only), and two nuke foci. Mana preservation? Beneficial 
casting haste? Range? Buff/HoT extension? Group heals? All missing. Now, 
there is a mana preservation focus on one drop on a three day spawn which is 
hunted by the Australian guild, and there is a range focus on the leggings 
that half my guild still wants.....

> Haste?  you mean haste for some clerics or something? :)

    No, melee haste (although casting haste is missing, too). It's no good 
trying to upgrade folks to Qvic bracers if they're still using Earth bracers 
for haste, or Brell help us if they use weapons for haste. Time has good 
haste items in quantity. We'd like to equip people with OoW haste augments, 
but given the rarity of Discordant Scoriae that's not something we can do.

    Eye of Dreams clicky is still a sought-after clicky in my guild - most 
casters outside of clerics don't have it. Hulcror, get ready to laugh, is a 
contested spawn on Quellious due to the rarity of 69-70 spell drops - he 
dies the day he pops. The only GoD instanced zone with the +MANA clicky is 
Uqua, and doing a two to three hour raid of pain which is very weak 
time/reward just to get one chance (drops off the golem) at that clicky is 
insane. You've also skipped clickables like +mana regen, which our recruits 
aren't going to see outside of Time (remember, these guys can't beat a MPG 
one group trial) and which they'll need to compete for anyways.

    It's huge utility. Our people that have them (and who are responsible 
for slowing) keep them equipped on raids and in groups over their epic 
1.5's. That says a lot.

    With us, we'd be able to do Qvic, Txevu, Qvic repop in one night. With 
the recruit quantity we have, doing Txevu with all the clearing AND doing 
Inktu'ta in one evening would be too ambitious.

> Muramite Boots 15.00
> Muramite Helm 10.00
> Muramite Bracer 10.00
> Shroud of Corruption 14.00

    Stop. Cynosure usually isn't up for us, so this item isn't an option.

> Divine Crystal Ring 50.00

    Nor is this.

> Jewel of Focus 5.00
> Muramite Sleeves 15.00
> Ixt Bone Scepter 10.00
> Great Maul of the Mighty

    I see you crapped out on the Aneuks. =/

> Chain Wraps of the Dark Master 10.00
> Chain Wraps of the Dark Master 14.00

    Runt was up for you. He's not always up for us, although the odds are 
better these days.

> Uncut Quartz of Defence
> Wristband of Chaotic Warfare 20.00
> Muramite's Heavy Shackles 28.00
> Muramite's Heavy Shackles 24.00
> Shroud of Ceaseless Might

    Four drops from Zun. We get to see Zun once every three pops, although 
right now we don't get to see him at all since our only officers with keys 
quit.

> Jagged Blade of Ice 7.00
> Shroud of Pandemonium 28.00
> Headband of Endless Night 10.00
> Dark Chain Circlet 50.00

    Now ACM is usually up. That, we could bag easy.

> Scales of the Cragbeast Queen 16.00
> Phosphorescent Bile 28.00
> Glowing Bile Drenched Jewel

    We avoid Uqua like the hole it is, so doing CBQ is a waste of time.

    Add in another five average drops for us from Qvic.

> 23 drops, not including the shit that rotted..

    For us it would be 14 drops, plus five more from Qvic. None of the Txevu 
drops would have gone to recruits save the Sceptre and the Maul. So recruits 
would get what, 10-12 drops? Versus the 30 in a night of Time?

> Assuming you recruited from a guild who at least reached potime

    That isn't an option for us. The big three don't recruit from each 
other, the Aussie guild sticks to their own, and the Time guild is very 
tight. That leaves the fallen Time guild and the scraps from the Time 
alliance, and the fallen Time guild and its 40 raiders are in negotiations 
to be absorbed by one of the big three guilds.

> you can
> discount most phase 1-3 items

    Not on my server, and I imagine not on Monual's either. Seriously, the 
Euro servers have always been top-heavy with raiders. You don't know how few 
guilds we have that we can recruit from.

    On my server, there is no Time rotation. Talking to others, it is much 
the same elsewhere. Anyone capable of making it to Time was quickly absorbed 
into other guilds above them by predatory recruitment. That's what happened 
to the fallen Time guild - they made it to Time, got VZ to 10%, and lost 20 
raiders in a week to the big three.

    Yes, *in your guild*. Remember, we're the guild that didn't kill the 
Aneuks except when we were going after Runt, and didn't kill Ixts unless we 
were going after ACM (and then only killed one). We do as little farming as 
possible, and combined with our historical size that means stuff still 
upgrades our regulars. Like I said, we still have a significant number of 
people who will go after Qvic armour, never mind anything better.

    Which instances did you hit? That's where the fun is. Otherwise, it's 
like saying "EQ sux, you just kill rats and bats. I got bored in one day."
