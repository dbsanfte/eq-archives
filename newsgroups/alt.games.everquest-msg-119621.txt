As I was wondering around the 3rd Gate looking for someone to sell coffins
and lesser shielding (never found) I came across a dead end in the rear of
the zone. It has a boulder and a fire pot. Clicking on the fire I got the
'you don't have a key' message (or something like it). Anyone know what that
is for or where it goes? Future zone or something I can check out now?  TIA
