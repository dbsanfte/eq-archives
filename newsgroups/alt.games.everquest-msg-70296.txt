At levels below 50 *I* don't risk dying.  There's nothing that I will be
fighting (grinding on) that will have any chance of killing me unless I do
something stupid or go LD.  Fungi is entirely a downtime reducer and allows
me to take mobs a level or two higher that would be too risky without it.

If you are actually at risk of dying in the sub-50 levels, you are still at
risk even with a fungi tunic.  People that don't have one thinks it makes
you god, people that do have one realize it just makes you a little faster.
