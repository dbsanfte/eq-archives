I think most likely and assuredly NO. The reason to overhaul current
stuff is the same reason they did for Luclin, to glean as much time
out of the current dead engine as possible with advancements in planes
of power. Its doing all you can to keep a dying animal going for the
next year and a half.

Porting just can't work. If you read the info on EQ2 character types
are totally different, without stats even. They select ways to
specialize in 4 different career choices. On top of that gear decays
and tradeskills are much more important. I just can't see current EQ
characters fitting into that at all. Why bother TRYING to make them
fit into it? That 60 warrior would not transfer with a CoF anyway,
both the players and designers would not want him to. Such items are
part of Old EQ, the fact that a 60 warrior NEEDS the CoF (or a similar
haste item) Everything you read about EQ2 seems to stress character
type and choices more than gear. Any thing from old EQ would just hold
EQ2's promise and entire point back.

I imagine at sometime, probably at the official announcement in may,
this will be one of the first things the FAQ answers. In the meantime
prepare yourselves because its very likely to be a "Sorry, that is a
hard no."
