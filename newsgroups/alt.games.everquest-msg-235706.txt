Nope, you get some people who expect to be buffed just because you can,
doesnt mean you have to, if you feel like helping them, go for it, if they
already have better buffs yours will not overwrite them.

Later on some of your buffs will require a reagent to cast (various gems
ranging from about 5gp per gem (read: per cast) to 10pp per cast), so if you
buff everyone you see, this will become quite expensive.

Even in groups, generally you should only give the people who are supposed
to be hit your best buffs (armour class plus hit point buff, standalone
armour class buff, and stand alone hit point buff, the last is commonly
referred to as 'symbol'), for the rest of the group, just the AC + HP
(armour class + hit point) and stand alone AC buff will do.  Dont be afraid
to ask for some loot to cover the cost of any reagents you use.

Go to zones with players around your level (or a little higher, as you are a
cleric), and put LFG and announce in /ooc that you are looking for a group.
Let the group know, if you feel you should, that you are new to the game and
would appreciate patience and / or general playing tips.

Depends, in LDoN (dungeon expansion) there is a set time limit, which means
you can do an adventure then leave the group with no problems, generally.
For standard xping, as a cleric, you will form the core of a group as the
main healer (as can druids / shaman at lower and higher (but generally, not
middle) levels. Let the group know how long you have (I usually give 30mins
to an hour warning before leaving an exp group), look for a replacement if
you can, but in the end, it is not your responsibility to find one.

Am tired, hopefully some others here will give you some general tips :)
