I was L9 the first time I tried to cross Antonica.  4 days later the
friend I was travelling with and I were able to recover our corpses
in EK and finish the trip with the help of a L14 Druid.

Fletching was very good to me, from the time I first had it explained
to me as a newbie.  And I explained it in turn to a fair number of
other newbs (mostly Rangers, a few Warriors) all of whom were just as
happy with it as I was.  For tradeskilling in general I agree with you,
but Fletching I found worthwhile and cost effective from the beginning,
even before all the nice new cash loots they added to the newbie zones.
