I just bought this today and i'm going to take it back tomorrow. It
has to be one of the most useless pieces of trash i've seen in a
while. What moron makes the decision to not include /loc coordinates
on a map? The entire point of a map in general is that you can use it
to track movement in an area. Hell, 9 times out of 10 i use an
Eqatlas.com map in order to track my way to a corpse using the
coordinates logged just before I died. Anybody who buys this with an
expectation for anything other than pretty pictures and dull words is
fooling themselves.
