  Just wondering, but did YOU ask the druid why she wasn't casting?  At
lower levels I've often found that the group "leader" just happens to be
whatever person has been in that spot the longest, and they might not
necessarily be the most responsible or knowledgeable of all the players and
they don't really have any more "authority" over the group than anybody.

  If somebody doesn't seem to be doing their job properly in a group, I
don't think it's rude to ask them what's up.  She just might not realize yet
that her role in the group shifts up around level 20.  Up to level 19,
druids do a lot of melee, since their 14-18 nuke is lame, their 14-18 heal
is lame and the fights might not be long enough for their DoTs and damage
shields to really be much good, but their melee skills are not yet TOO far
behind that of the melee classes.  So in those levels, a druid's main
contribution may be buffs and melee.  Perhaps this druid just hasn't come to
realize yet that she has a fairly solid nuke and heal spell that she can use
and that her damage shields are now probably lasting long enough to make a
good contribution to the damage of the group.

  Don't leave it up to the group leader to educate your group... if you have
a suggestion to make to improve the functioning of the group, make it.
Don't be rude about it, but don't be too coy either.
