There you go again with the ganking. :P  Seriously, I do not think it is
THAT big of a problem.  Not to mention there are problems equally as bad in
EQ.  The new games also do not really have a strict death penalty like EQ
does on top of it.  I agree ganking does suck, but come on.  It is hardly a
reason to avoid playing a game and it is a rare occurance.  The new breed of
MMORPG's (with the exception of Shadowbane) also certainly do not seem to be
the chaotic PK death fests of ancient UO (RIP, may OSI see the light and
bring a server back with this codebase someday).  Shadowbane does not seem
to be like that at all either since guilds are basically a requirement.
There will be very little room for grief playing there.  I agree that EQ is
not going to go away in a day or a year or even two years.  It will be
gradual.  I do believe a very large percentage of EQ players will try the
new games.  Many many many will end up going back to EQ and sticking with it
but then I believe they will also try the next game to come out and so and
so down the line.  It will be a gradual filtering process, not all at once.
Something like 1000 EQ players TRY AO, 800 return to EQ.  Then 800 try DAOC
and 600 go back to EQ, etc.  This is just my opinion and what I think will
happen, please do not be offended by it :P  heh.  There is nothing to argue
about here.  It is simply people predicting how people will react to the
oncoming MMORPGs.  This is a VERY exciting time in the genre whether you are
looking forward to them or not and debate and speculation will surely run
rampant all over the place.  I see a lot of interesting things ahead and
hope I am in the middle of it all.
