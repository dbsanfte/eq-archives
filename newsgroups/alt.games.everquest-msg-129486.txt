What is the Bard sining/twisting?

If the Bard is @29 then he should not be doing just straight melee.

He should use is level 27 charm to turn adds into pets.

Chains to snare/slow (maybe stack with your slow?)

Self Haste to speed up DPS.

Hymn to augment your regen (Combine Lute from Katta to boost
performance)

Breeze song to pump mana
