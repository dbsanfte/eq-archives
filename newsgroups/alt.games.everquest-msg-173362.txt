There is a command /corpse this will summon your corpse a short distance
if you have no target, or the targetted corpse if you have multiple in
range, or another persons corpse if you target it and have consent to drag

If the corpse is close enough you may be able to summon it without
generating aggro. If not you have to set the /corpse to a hotkey (I
combine it with a /loc as well) and run through the mobs clicking the
hotkey like mad...then run to the nearest guards or zone line - the guards
kills the mobs, or you zone back in and loot the corpse.

The /loc combined hotkey is useful as if you are going to die you hit the
key and at least know where the corpse is.

Also a point to try and remember is if you are going to lose the fight get
out of the spawning area so the corpse is away from the mobs.

Other alternatives here are get the right invis spell (invis vs undead
here) cast on you and drag the corpse out under that spell - looting will
break it so make sure you are clear. Or get a suitable high level person
to dash thru and grab the corpse.

At lvl 10 and losing no xp you can essentially do the dash and run even if
you die rapidly eventually the clothed corpse will be recovered for no xp
loss....this will stop working soon.

Are you missing the snare wears off message? Once they hit the point they
run then snare should lock them down...unless they are running early in
which case it'll be a walk off. They run early if you are very tough
compared to them. If the mob runs (not walks away) then the snare has worn
off. How good is your relevant casting skill as that affects the spell.

The flick up an then down is a known visible effect...bandaging will  only
work below 50% with a few high level exceptions. The amount healed is
related to your skill in bind wound. If thats low the HP given back will
be minimal...if you intend to use this method then you need to practise it
a lot. My 36lvl ranger has bind of 150 odd and I still regularly use the
skill to heal to 50% before I start using my crappy 33 point heal...
