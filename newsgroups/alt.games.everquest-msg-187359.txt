The GMs aren't total idiots. They are able to recognize a desperate
line of bullshit, which was exactly what your "example" was. They also
know that it's not below a *lot* of players to try to fuck with people
that piss them off in such ways. They'd have to come up with something
a LOT more substantial than what you came up with to get my name
changed.

Irrelevant. Once made aware of what the name means, it's still going
to be ruled to be against the rules since it's still the name of a
popular American media figure. It's not "OK" because it's in another
language and not recognized offhand, just as a foreign word for an
obscenity isn't OK just because not many people recognize it.
