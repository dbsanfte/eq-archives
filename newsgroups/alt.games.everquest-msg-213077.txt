Oh, I see the difference. One's veiling emotion, the other isn't.

Who said anything about a conspiracy? Just that you make no secret in
the fact that you don't like me and thus late it color your response
to me, even if that means holding double-standards against me.

No, that would imply that the person I was talking to doesn't. The
fact I can see obvious assumptions doesn't mean that I solidly know
more on the topic. I still, however, wasn't the first to make claims
about their testing regime, no matter how you try to skew and
selectively quote.

That tells me only that their testing system doesn't include every
possible configuration. Nothing more.

No, you didn't cite anything that we didn't already know. You cited
symptoms, but no proof of the cause that you claim.

I will be as soon as you're done diverting and cough up proof of your
claims.

How quaint. If someone dares speak out about stupid, baseless, and/or
over-exagerrated criticism, they're a "devout fanboy"....

The point is that they can't cover every possible configuration. If
you mix and match hardware and software configurations, you'll come up
with something that doesn't work for any game. They can't make the
software work for every single configuration out there. Period. It's
either a) impossible to achieve or b) far too expensive in terms of
man hours to please far too small a portion of their market to be
worthwhile. If a company tries to please every one all the time,
they'll drive themselves bankrupt fast.
