Typical PoV group this week. Group leader (a caster) decides scrolls
are caster only. First scroll goes to a level 60 group wizard who
mentions that he's planning on getting 35 more AAs before he dings 61.
And there is a stunned pall of silence when I suggest that the roll
for the razorfiend talons (a component of some uber-ring) be melee
only.

I'm getting really sick of the smug sense of entitlement that casters
have gotten. The system is already showing signs of strain. If it
doesn't collapse soon, I may swear off pickup groups all together.
