Actually, I kept Phinny mezzed with Glamour of Kintaz (GoK...level 55ish)
for quite some time while we were recovering from pulling 6 seahorses. :p

I can Rapture (48 second mez with 24 second recast...something like
that...I'm not going to go look it up for exacts :p ) anything in Phinny's
abode at 60.

In answer to a later post; Hughes, yes, Phinny can be single-double pulled
by someone who knows what they're doing.  BUT.  There aren't that many
people who know Kedge.

After about 5 trips there, yesterday we still had 2 groups (50+) because of
those who just wanted to go.  First pull we pulled 3 horses & phinny (oops!)
due to an inexperienced (in kedge...otherwise very experienced) monk.  No
one died because we had 2 level 60 enchanters there with Rapture memmed.
