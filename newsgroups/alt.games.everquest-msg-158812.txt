We have many, many rangers in our guild.   Some handle thier aggro just
fine.  Others do not.

One of our level 60 rangers used to begin every fight by casting both of his
DoT's on whatever we were fighting, then opening up full melee.  Then he
complained bitterly about how useless jolt was, since it couldn't ditch
aggro for him....  Another one is 57 or so.  I'm not even sure he's heard of
the spell jolt, much less used it.  He certainly has no idea on subtle
concepts such as positioning and what "enrage" means, thats for sure....

Hehe... on the other end of the spectrum, one of our level 60 rangers is
almost too good about his aggro control.   He's so used to ducking aggro,
that (a friend tells me) when thier exp group asked him to tank...  he
couldn't manage to hold aggro at all.   The second she cast on a mob, it
would leave him and try to eat her alive. ; )

Rangers and Rogues have the tools to avoid thier aggro.  And some can do so
very well.   (There are good and bad players in both classes, but the rogues
seem to be better at this on average.)   Paladins and SK's do not.  If they
have a high taunt weapon like thier epics, it takes a very skilled player to
consistantly keep it on the warrior.    (or a very well equipped warrior)
