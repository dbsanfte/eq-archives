I live in Denmark, and dont really see a big problem with the POP.
www.dvdboxoffice.com
Free shipping, took 9 day delivery to denmark, around 10$ cheaper than 
the FIRST danish company had it for sale (got a store that import from 
US, usually got games before rest, but expensive).
This will requite a credit card, which you should have access to in some 
  form since youre able to pay your card bill every month.
