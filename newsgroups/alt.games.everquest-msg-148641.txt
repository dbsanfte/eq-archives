Im sorry, but monks aren't even close to comparibly equipped rogues in terms
of DPS.

We mitigate well, yeah.  Better than a warrior?  Sorry but imo its just
warrior whining because they want beefing up.

How about the cleric in my guild who has 150, the rogue who has 150+ (and
70ish on his cleric), or the SK in my guild who has 140ish.  A guildie
ranger has AM3/EQ3/whatever else he chose before those, so he's not doing
too shabby himself.

My number of aa levels is irelevant of how "overpowered" my class is, if
anything its a representation of how long, or how effectively, i exp (or how
lacking of a life i am)
