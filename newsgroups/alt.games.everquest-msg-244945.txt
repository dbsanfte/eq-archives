Indeed.   By Palindrome's logic, whenever he goes to a new group for the
first time, everyone there is automaticly a lurker, because he's never seen
any of them post there before.

For the record, Martin posts less than he used to, but a 10 second google
search shows that over the last 3 years, which you say you've been here for,
he has posted over 4,000 times. (1)

http://www.google.com/groups?safe=images&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_ugroup=alt.games.everquest&as_uauthors=%22-martin%22&as_drrb=b&as_mind=12&as_minm=5&as_miny=2000&as_maxd=25&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=2004&as_scoring=d&lr=&num=100&hl=en

If you accused him of being a troll and a lurker because you've somehow
managed to miss seeing him post, then it would appear to me that the fault
is yours for not doing your homework before opening your mouth.



(1) The search turns up 4,250 posts, but also picks up posts from Chris
Martin.   Searching for Chris Martin excludes 250 posts, leaving 4000
by -martin.
