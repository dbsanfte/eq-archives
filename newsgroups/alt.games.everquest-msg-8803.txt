Well, you need to have a good channeling skill. Last night, for instance,
some MOB hit me for 130, 130, 80, and I was knocked back a foot or two, but
kept on casting. I don't know how common it is for other casters, but it
happens pretty often for me at 45 (I hate this level).

This time is usually better spent if everyone stays on the current target,
though. Just stun/mez and you should be fine.

If I have three reds on me I'll be dead in about half a second anyway, so it
won't matter. However, if you were to survive, it might go something like:
AE stun, mez MOB #1, cleric heals enchanter, MOB #2/3 aggro cleric,
enchanter stuns MOB #2/3, mez MOB #2, tanks engage MOB #3, stun again.
