Well if we are talking about using predisposition as an excuse then I
agree, I don't like that.  I do like the idea of people recognizing
their own predispositions so they are better prepared to actively use
their free will to overcome the things which they choose.  This seems to
imply an actual higher level of self responsibility since you have no
excuse, you already know you are predisposed so you dang well better be
able to use your will to overcome them.  I have a predisposition to
chemical dependence, known that since I was a wee boy and drank my first
shot and smoked my first joint.  I made a conscious choice to stay the
hell away from heroin based on that knowledge hehe and it has served me
well in life, but if I hadn't then the blame would fall squarely on
myself, not on my predispositions.  I know you are probably speaking of
"genetic predispositions" but I don't make that distinction.  I don't
know if there are physical (genetic) reasons behind my own personal
tendencies or if they are all psychological in nature and it doesn't
matter to me, all that matters is that I see the pattern and act to
avoid repeating it if that is my choice.  You are quite right that many
would simply use such information as an excuse after the fact though as
opposed to using it to drive free will to overcome their urges.

Nope, one spine,  one heart, one soul, just two extremely diverse
minds.  Unfortunately they both are prone to extremes and so either can
lead me astray at any time.  The key I find is to let them both have
full control and to some extent they cancel each other out <G>.  Still,
if offered sanity as a replacement for that which I've known my whole
life I don't know that I would accept.  It just seems so boring from my
perspective, but I only know it from what I see so maybe sanity is nice
too <G>.
