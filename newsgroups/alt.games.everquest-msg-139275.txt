Yeah, its kind of funny the only person I saw complain about this
really was a druidess in FOH on the druid board. For like 99 percent
of the EQ population it would have been a non issue, even at 60. It
would only come into play I think when you are getting bps and things
with plus 100 mana.

Verant even explained it that way, when the cap was in there was
basically no remote way a person would get to it. Then there was
possibly with velious/luclin I guess.
