I liked it more 'back then too'... but in the big scheme of things level 
1 to 10 is and always was a heartbeat.

Things like soulbinders and portstones are a reflection of the expanded 
game today... once upon a time you couldn't go to a newbie city and 
routinely combe be unable to find someone who could bind you...now 
they're deserted ... putting the soulbinders in made a lot of 
sense...nothing sucked more than taking a 30th level pali to halas to 
bind before going into Permafrost and not being able to find anybody for 
the better part of an hour... so you head to qeynos and there isn't 
anybody there either... might as well call it a night... because hunting 
giants or ice goblins or whatever isn't a fun prospect if you are still 
bound in gfay... which would be the reality if soulbinders and 
portstones were absent. And don't say that if there were no port stones 
and soulbinders players would be fillng this niche... because in the 
luclin and velious eras I regularly had to log out because my characters 
couldn't get a bind in places like Halas or Grobb and there was no way I 
was going to go adventuring when I was bound an hour or more away.

I think it was a massive failure of the game designers to allow the old 
world to become obsolete in the first place, but having that as a fait 
accompli... putting soul binders and portstones in is only a logical move.

But regardless... the journey from 1 to 50 is much as it was 4 years 
ago, except now you have the option of equipping yourself with fabulous 
gear for minimal effort due to the player economy (which is not a game 
mechanic per se) and there is nothing SOE could have done about that 
within the original game... even with no expansions... EQ lacks item 
decay and level requirements... the longer the game goes the more stuff 
will exist and the cheaper the best stuff you can buy will get.

I agree the game is 'easier' now than it was... but as the game matured 
it was actually getting harder to get ports and binds at low levels... 
as usual SOE used a sledge hammer when a pair of tweezers was 
required... but for all that: *something* had to be done.
