If you have the Planes of Power expansion, you have a ready source of
income (and experience, too, when you're levels 1-5). Find the Bard's
guild in the tree city of Kelethin (it's pretty close to the lift).
Hail Idia, and when she speaks to you tell her you will deliver mail
to Freeport. She'll give you a package.
Now head down the lift and along the path to the east, where you'll
find a Plane of Knowledge portal. Zone to the PoK, run over to the
Freeport portal (there's a map in the back of the PoP manual), and
zone to Freeport. Head to the bard's guild in North Freeport, deliver
the mail to Felicity Starbright, and you'll get 12 gold, some
experience, and some faction. Now speak to Ton Twostrings in the same
room, tell hi you will deliver to Kelethin, and he'll give you a
package. Head through the PoK  to Kelethin, deliver the mail to Idia,
and get experience, more faction, and 9 gold. That's 2 platinum, 1
gold per round trip, and it doesn't take much longer to do it as it
does for me to type this. You can do this repeatedly and make some
decent cash, without fighting anything (which makes this a great way
to get the first level or two for a new character).
