DT, this has been debated before at considerable length. Your welcome to 
to beleive it. Several others and I were unconvinced by your arguments 
last time, and you were similiarly unconvinced by ours.

However, considering the number of people who have not only taken the 
other side on this position, but are outright incredulous that you are 
serious; its you that are being dense if you act taken aback when yet 
another person has no idea where your coming from.

The cite he is looking for is not the proof of existence of copyright 
legislation but rather, an actual, honest to goodness, relevant court 
case with a verdict, that established something even resembling what you 
are asserting.
