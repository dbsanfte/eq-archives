I can't help much with the Ghoul, he seems to hit everywhere, I've
seen him at the bandit farm closest to Qeynos Hills, on the road near
the two bandit spawn (around 11000, neg 2500 if I recall correctly),
and at the Ogre shrine. He moves fast, I think he starts south east
and heads generally west and north across the zone.

At 35 you might want to try hunting in Nagafen's Lair. Kobolds drop
3-4 pp usually, and spawn rates are pretty high so you can usually
kill at a high rate. Rangers are well liked there, it's a dungeon so
there aren't many Druids, and snaring is essential to a safe camp. The
Kobolds also drop Fine Steel weapons and medium bronze armour, with EC
so close it's actually worthwhile hauling the bronze out and
auctioning on the way to the Freeport bank. I haven't actually
counted, but I'd estimate around 40-50 pp per hour is normal.
