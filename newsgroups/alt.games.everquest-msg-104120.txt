Thanks to all who responded.

OK, wrote to my ISP and my most recent posting appeared (previous ones
haven't re-appeared). However, knowing the process that mail to them goes
through and the fact that I only did it ten minutes ago, I doubt whether it
was in response to my email, probably just a glitch that has now rectified
itself or perhaps others have complained too.
