}Bah - long post, but not worth it, so I canceled it.  Suffice it
}to say, the moment you start thowing numbers like 3 minutes around when
}it was clearly stated by WD that they waited *30* minutes at his 
}insistence, and by me that we waited 1.5 *HOURS* you lose any credibility.

That's all right.  I'm sure my standings on the credibility board are high 
enough that I can afford to take a loss. :)

My interpretation was:  WD (or whoever) said they waited 30 minutes for an 
LD, you said "gaah! I wouldn't wait at all!", I said "well, I'd wait 3 
minutes or so, maybe more if it really mattered."  But view it as you 
wish.  

And the other issue I said things like 3 minutes about, was about 
taking an adventure the -moment- someone joined a group, which is 
substantially less than 30 minutes. :)

And I admit, I missed wherever you said you waited 1.5 hours. *shrug*.  
unless you mean: 

Sean:
}The only thing I worry about in terms of win/loss is whether I'm going to 
}waste 90minutes getting lackluster XP and not get my points out of it.

Which isn't quite the same as waiting, is it?  Not to mention that it's 
a view I substantially agreed with.  Or could it be:

Sean:
}Last week I had one good sized block of playing time (5 hours, Thursday
}morning).  And due to the kind of prissy "Oh dear, we might get a boo 
}boo" attitude that this guy showed, I lost over 1/3rd of that sitting on 
}my ass.

Which I was responding to by suggesting that /disb /LFG would result, at 
my usual playtimes, in waiting at least that long.  But I definitely said 
nothing about 3 minutes to that.

Ahh well.  If you're going to impugn someone's credibility, just make sure 
you've got the facts all straight about what they said, or ya might take a 
little hit yourself.  But you're pretty high in the credibility standings 
too, so I guess that's ok.
