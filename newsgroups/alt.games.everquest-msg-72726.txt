  Browsing the Tech Support forums in an attempt to find a fix for my
horrible frame rates, I happened upon an interesting discussion about
some players speculating/deducing just exactly what the problem is.
One of the posters created this web site:http://www.t35.com/sol/ which
demonstrates one of his theories about what the problem with the new
engine is.

  If you notice, on that site, on the tests he ran, he gets MUCH
better performance when using an older version of the EQGfx_DX8.dll
(the 1.0.64 version released on 12/5) than he does with the current
engine (22 FPS vs. 8 FPS in one test).  I got this older version of
the file and decided to see if I'd have similar results, and low and
behold, so far I seem to be.  When walking through Neriak before, I'd
get what I'd call "gameplay hindering frame rates" which were bad
enough to make simple tasks like turning around and targeting a foe
difficult.  Now, when walking through Neriak, I get what I'd call "a
slightly annoying stutter" which is easily noticeable but not nearly
bad enough to cause any difficulties in most combat situations.

  The downside to running with the older 1.0.64 versions of the DLL is
that most of the text (at least on my system) is much larger than it's
supposed to be, and unless I position my chat window on the extreme
left corner of the screen, half of the text in long messages run off
it and can't be read.  A very annoying and unsightly anomaly, but
using this version of the DLL is the only way I can function in zones
like Runnyeye, Befallen, Unrest and Rivervale.

  Hopefully soon they will patch the file to fix both problems so we
can enjoy decent frame rates and proper sized text, but until then,
some of you might want to try the older DLL.  To use it, you first
have to acquire the older version of the DLL.  If you don't have it or
can't find it, email me and I'll send it to you.  If I get an
overwhelming response, I'll try to post it somewhere on the web for
download.  I can't promise I'll be able to send it to everyone.  After
you get the file, you run the patcher (with Autoplay off) and after
it's done doing the file check, move or rename the EQGfx_DX8.dll file
in your EQ directory (C:\Program Files\EverQuest by default) and copy
the 1.0.64 version of the file in to the EQ directory.  Press "Play"
and viola.

  When you close EQ, you'll have to move/rename the "current" version
of the EQGfx_DX8.dll file back to normal, and move the 1.0.64 version
out again, or else the next time you run the patcher, during the file
check it'll see you're running with an older version of the graphics
engine and patch it with the current version.

  A disclaimer... I don't know what Verant's stance on this is, but I
guess technically it could be considered violating their EULA/TOS by
modifying the client program in an unauthorized manner.  Also, realize
you're using an older version of the graphics engine and there may be
other bugs other than just the large text (this is the only bug I
encounter with it, but there may be others).  Don't expect any support
from Verant if you're using the older DLL (though the way things are
going lately, you perhaps shouldn't expect any support from them even
if you are using the most current DLL).  If this jacks your system
(doubtful) or gets you banned (doubtful also, but I wouldn't put it
past Verant), don't come crying to me.  I'm "risking" it because if
Verant does catch me doing this and does decide to ban me for it, I
don't want to be a paying customer of theirs anyway.

  Good luck.
