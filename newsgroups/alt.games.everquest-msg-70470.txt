I'm not entirely convinced of that. I think that Everquest surfaces a
problem, but that the problem is indeed the SBLive, not Everquest.

The SBLive worked wonderfully in EQ under Win98. It was only when I
upgraded to Win2k (and the appropriate SBLive drivers) that I got
crummy sound.

That was my experience with the SBLive, also. But I still don't place
the blame at the foot of Verant, because the problems appeared only
under Win2k, and because in my experience with two other sound cards,
the problems are reduced or non-existent.

And while I had no SBLive problems in any other games, I did have a
LOT of system problems for awhile that appeared out of nowhere, but
ultimately went away when I got the last SBLive related files off the
machine. Which leads to my largest gripe with the SBLive - the
uninstall does an awful job of uninstalling. I had to manually go
through the registry to get rid of all the references, and likewise
manually hunt down and delete several SBLive driver files.

Actually, I was rather surprised when I was trying to solve those
machine problems - when I first bought the SBLive card, it was
regarded with near reverence among users, which was how I felt as
well. But more recently, it seems to have lost a lot of its
popularity, largely because of the sort of systems problems I had
experienced, and partly because of the complete lack of updates for
Win2k.

I had one of the Philips Rhythmic series cards in my system briefly,
and it worked quite well with EQ under Win2k. Sound levels were
consistent and stereo imaging was correct.

Overall, though, I didn't like the card, and have replaced it with the
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz. This card also works *pretty* well, though
not perfectly, in EQ (though I haven't tested since I upgraded the
drivers again a few days ago).

Oddly, having played EQ with no sound at all for so long, I've found
that I kind of prefer it that way now.
