I got it yesterday and it's pretty fun. The game is huge and the
graphics and sound are absolutely top notch. It seems to lack the
driving story of Diablo though that would keep you going because every
quest was moderately short and somewhat interesting in Diablo. In
Dungeon Siege, some dungeons are just so long that you start losing
interest by the time you reach the exit. Maybe it's just me though. :)
I'm still pretty early in so maybe it picks up.
