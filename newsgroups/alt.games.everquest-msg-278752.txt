But when you are replaying you can zip through te early levels because you know how to min max, can buy collection quest 
items, etc. Getting every quest for a particular mob and getting 3 credits per kill will be even quicker if they bring 
out this new rule they are talking about that collection quests don't count to the total number of quests.

I think there's a few like gnoll quests, bear quests and another one where you can get 3 credits for each kill, possibly 
4 for gnolls. And killing mobs en masse is even easier than it used to be. It doesn't take much effort to get through 
the undead on the island NE of qeynos, whereas it used to be a nightmare solo.

If only they would arrange a system of quest sharing, or something to encourage people with the same quests to group. I 
love the game best when i am doing group quests. Soloing 40 of anything, especially if you are one of the classes which 
must fight them singly, is tedious solo, and easy and fast in a group. I was in a group in TS fighting tough ++ gnolls 
and we still chewed through them. Solo, it's time to make like a rabbit.
