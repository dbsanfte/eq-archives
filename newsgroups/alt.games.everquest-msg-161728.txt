How about learn to just DIE rather than kill half the fucking zone with a
huge ass train.

Its rude, its downright fucking selfish, and its straight out of karnors
type zones.

I truly wish PoP mobs summoned.  i wish people would wisen up to the fact
there are no lengthy difficult CR's, simply wait 10 mins and your corpse is
at the gy, and I wish players had some simple damn respect and decency for
others and just die rather than killing innocent people.

No, you'd rather 1-10 INNOCENT players get mowed down, lose mana, buffs and
exp, because YOU fucked up.

In PoV ive been in a wastelands group that got trained 4-5 times in a 2 hour
or less period, I've had my group trained in the castle (moving to the
camp/buffing etc) god knows how many times, I've done castle guards and had
the vessels trained on my group, I've solod by the corner of the water and
had rude bastards train me, I've zoned in and my shaman been killed the
instant I loaded, Ive had kiters come running to me every 5 mins with a mob
at less than 50%, yelling "help help!" running the mob all through my camp
(but obviously they get the solo exp cuz hes less than half)

Tell me why I should have to be inconveniened or suffer because your
incompetent at pulling, and/or because your selfish and rude?

If I went out of my way to get KEI for my soloing sessions, why should I
lose a valuable buff and my donation because of you?

If you can't get to your camp safely then
a) Get invis / an invis item
b) Get your group to meet you at a safe spot/the zoneline
c) Find a new zone

If you can't pull without getting adds in numbers that require training,
then
a) Get a puller with a clue
b) Find an easier/safer spot
c) Find an easier zone
d) Suck up the death and learn a lesson from your train

I cringe when I see 60+ players acting like the dumb fuck retards I saw at
level 50 in karnors, or level 40 in DL.

Probably more-so because I left noob pickup zones a long long time ago (or
just raided every single day) and didn't bump into them.

Call me an elitist if you want, but I dont fuck other people over, and I
dont expect it from them, least of all every 5 damn minutes.

(ps if you didnt figure it,  trains are one of my top 3 peeves)
