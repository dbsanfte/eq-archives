You certainly want to get your 1hs up to speed. You will generate more 
hate with faster 1hs weapons that a 2hs weapon, allowing you to tank more 
effectively. When you are not the main tank in a group, you will still 
want a higher dmg 2hs weapon though. My point is, keep both skills up. On 
my tank classes, I normally try and make it a point to work all weapon 
skills. You never know when you might come across a sweet weapon, and it 
is nice to know that you can be effecive with it if you do.

As others have advised, grab the fastest 1hs you can find to get your 
skill up. If you dual wield 1hs, it should go up fairly fast. You just 
need to make sure you are fighting light blue mobs or better.

Hth.
