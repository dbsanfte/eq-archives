Why do you need more then 6 people in a group anyway?  Heck you don't even
always need 6.

I've been doing a lot of grouping lately, which for the most part is 2 60
monks, and me running my cleric bot, unless the girlf is on  (she also has a
60 cleric)

We regularly kill a level 56 mob with the 2/3 of us (I mean several times a
day), and we've killed a 56,60, and redcon to 60 mob that flurries, with
just me tanking/running a bot

We play early and are doing a lot of the stuff that *NEEDS* a warrior, a
chanter, a snarer, an evacer... but we've done fine without any of that.

We did the siren house in SG (where the princess is) with me running
monk/shaman, the other monk, and a cleric.. I know a lot of people that
won't even do this without 2 full groups.

The 3 of us can do kael arena.. again, I know a lot of people who wouldn't
do this without the "essential" classes (and lots of them)....

The other monk teases us that he feels useless, cuz im puller/MA/healer more
often then not heh.

we plan to hit HS next (which will be our first time without the "essential
classes" tank/rogue/chanter/snarer/evacer) and I think not only will the 3
of us do well, the exp will probably be great.

Makes me laugh when I think back to my Sebilis days.. where I wouldn't leave
the zonein if we didn't have any form of crowd control and snarer!
