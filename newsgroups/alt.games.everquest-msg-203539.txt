Whenever I get KEI I pay 25 or 30pp and not a plat more.  Why?  Well
consider...  If I hunt solo in say BW or OOT with a 3hr KEI I generally make
around 800pp to 1.5K tops depending on how many others are on at that time.
Yes I realize some umber types farm in places like LG and make as much as 7K
on one item but I'm not one of thoes Umber types.  If I get KEI because I'm
grouping in Po? generally I don't make 100pp since I'm a caster and seldom
get to loot.  Anyway sitting tends to be a better option for a caster than
running around looting, even if one could.  So if I pay 30pp for a KEI I'm
generally contrubutaing about 3% of my pp if hunting.  Not a lot granted but
if you consider a KEI'er in Nexus at peak playing time can cast KEI around
10 times an hour and probably averages 4 customers per cast.  If one pays
20pp, one 25pp, one 30pp and one 35pp then the Chanter makes 27.5pp per cast
or 275pp an hour OR 825pp in 3 hours.  Thats just about what I'll make
hunting with their KEI and hunting is more work and has a LOT more risks
than sitting on the platform in Nexus.  Considering that about 25% of the
time I get KEI because of grouping in Po? (Its beem my experience that few
groups want a caster [except for a Claric] and even fewer want a caster
without KEI although occassionally I've found these groups) the actual
percentage I pay for the KEI is a bit higher than 3%.. probably more like 6%
or so.  Just seems to me like a fair way of determining what I pay for KEI.
I've never been turned down and if it did happen, no problem, I've hunted
without KEI before and will again!
