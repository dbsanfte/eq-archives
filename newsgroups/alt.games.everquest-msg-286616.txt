I know, SK and DPS are not synonymous.  But to whatever extent I can do 
some damage, I'd like to work in that direction.

The strategy I've adopted thus far is one of improving my lifetap 
output.  This plan is twofold; I can do more damage, and get more 
healing coming in.

TO this end, I went with the AA that give me crit DD and crit heals, and 
the ones that increase the size of my lifetap procs.

I'm using a weapon which has lifetap III, and I put a lifetap II augment 
in it.  I constantly run my best lifetap proc buff, and I have the first 
level of touch of the cursed, which gave me yet another lifetap proc, 
without eating a buff slot or an aug slot.

I also have a focus item that improves the size of magic based damage 
spells, which works on both DD (Lifetap) and DOT (Lifetap over time) but 
the latter doesn't improve the heal size of the LOT, just the damage size.

I put a +3 damage aug in the remaining slot in my weapon, but I could 
dump another lifetap aug in instead, or some sort of DD aug or something 
else.

I'm going to get my 1.5 epic shortly, and I'll see less DPS increase 
putting that +3 damage aug in it than in my current 42/30 weapon.

Another SK in my guild swears by his devotion to a DOT strategy, he's 
pumped his dot crits and so on, and runs a mana tap proc rather than a 
hp tap; I spend as little time casting as possible to increase my DPS 
from swinging weapons and my various procs, while he attempts to chain 
cast DOTS as fast as possible and could care less about his weapon based 
DPS.

Any thoughts?
