I don't recommend jewelry for anyone but an enchanter, as enchanters are the only
ones that can produce the enchanted metal bars that are need to make jewelry with
stats (for example, INT +2).  Otherwise, all you get is an expensive piece of jewelry
that doesn't do anything.  You might think that you could talk an enchanter into
enchanting metal bars for you.  You might find one, but they're probably a jeweler
themselves already, and wouldn't have a lot of motivation to help out a competitor.
Plus, enchanting metal bars can take a lot of mana, and so they'd need to med up
afterward = lots of time spent on their part.  My enchanter, when he first got level 8
(and the enchant silver spell) could only enchant about 5 bars of silver from full mana
to zero mana.  He's almost to the level where he can start enchanting gold, but won't
have enough money to practice much.  Each try is getting expensive.

Like someone else said, take up fletching.  The market is smaller for fletchers, but
with the wood elf cultural bows coming into the game, you'll be in demand once you
get to a high enough level in fletching (will require at least 2000 platinum, and
clicking till your eyes bleed to get there though).  Check out this site for starters:
