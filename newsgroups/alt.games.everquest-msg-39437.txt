Well, I dunno. :) But people are concerned with SneakyAmp, because of the
way it watches the keyboard. Basically, whatever you're doing, SneakyAmp is
watching the keyboard hoping to see something exciting, so it can control
Winamp. People are concerned that if its watching the keyboard, I could have
it send whatever you type when you log in to EQ to me. But I'm neither that
mean, or that smart - so I couldnt do that if I wanted to. :) So far no one
has asked for the source though. ::shrug::

Hrmm. Hope that made sense.
Joe
