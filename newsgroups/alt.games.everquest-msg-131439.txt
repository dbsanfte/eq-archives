If you are unhappy with their policies, you are also free to ask them to
change their policies.  If they choose not to change them, you are free to
find a different newsservice that has policies more in line with what you
want.  Much like Sanjian is free to choose to ask them to change their
policies, and if they don't, free to choose whether or not to remain a
customer of theirs.
