Do the loot rules apply to all Magic or No Drop items? Because it seems to
me that would potentially make some quests undoable once you reached a
certain level.

Now, while this might make sense for some quests, series quest like the
Coldain ring or shawl quests would become a major pain, you'd have to make
sure you started them at the right level for all the mobs that drop the junk
you need to be blue to you. For instance, you can't do step 7 of the shawl
quests (when you actually get a nice item) until you are in your 50s and the
mobs for 1-3 will all be way green by then. The rewards before step 5 at
least are frankly crap, so many people wouldn't start the quests until later
levels. Not a major issue to work around I know, but still...

Personally, I dislike the whole idea of the loot rules. Exactly which lowbie
(sub-20 or 30) dungeons are constantly camped by farmers (except maybe
Runnyeye now for BA stuff, but that's usually deserted in my experience
anyway) and for what? Even if you can't take your L50+ farmer char in, you
can take your twinked all to hell barely loot rules level compliant
character in instead and do the same thing as PLing a char (DSs, mem blur,
or simple nukes when it's below 50%). A little more effort than camping with
a high-level char, but if you really want to farm an item minor problems
like that aren't going to bother you much.
