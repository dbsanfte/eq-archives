They'll also clean your clock if the bear attacks *you* first.

I've died this way a few times by making the mistake of sitting
down to meditate at the NK druid ring.  A bear, seeing me
sitting, took me for an easy target (even at high levels), and
took a swipe at me.  The Druids then saw me "fighting" with the
Bear, even though I hadn't hit back, and all jumped me as well.
