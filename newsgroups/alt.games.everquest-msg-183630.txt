Motivation is easy, get it over.
Crippled? No not if done correctly, in fact some classes benifit from
it. Casters/Hybreds will have a very high defense skill set that they
would not have ordinarily. These are tough skills to get and
invaluable later on. Melees come out even better as they dont have to
spend time in nexus casting spells to get those skills up. So to go
against conventional wisdom I would rather have a PL char long as its
done right.
