Thats not being too cautious.   If thats what happened then your MA was a
moron :)

Hmm.. describe exactly where you fought him?  There are basically 2 spots I
know of where he is fought.
The "Safehouse" spot, and our spot (nobody else I've seen kills him where we
do), tho im sure its "our spot" to a lot of other guilds on diff servers
too.

There are very few mobs that are KOS to all (namely Vindi, AoW), everything
else is on a faction.  A Rallos Zek warrior has pretty much free-run of the
place minus behind the icewall, and beyond Tormax' ramp.. and quite frankly
i find it unlikely you'd be fighting AoW in one of those 2 locations.

Can only bind at the zonelines.  Dieing and running back to the arena really
isn't a big deal though, and takes all of 30 seconds.

No.  But he won't poof if he is agrod.  It can be highly entertaining
watching your guild monks try to stop AoW from poofing :)

In an extreme circumstance (double flurry) theres nothing you can really do
to keep your MA up.. generally speaking though his flurrys aren't common.

talking

Thats what you thought was rampage...  AoW is very sensitive to people near
him.  Each one that got hit was taking agro off the MA, gettin smacked once
or twice (to death) before he turned back to your MA.  Once you lose your
DPS your done for, you simply can't keep AoW type intensive healing going
for large amounts of time (actually the more I write this, the more I
think.. well the old AoW.. After the modrod change, AoW was turned into a
pale shadow of his former self, whilst he still hits the same and looks the
same, I think its less demanding now)

> Hmm, the friend from the higher tier guild I was talking to specifically
said

Enrage?  Of course it couldn't be that, you never got him to 10%.. hmm  I
don't know what your friend was refering to, because AoW just does not
rampage, fact.

Normal pin method.   Anyway even with defensive, unless cheals have already
started being cast on you, if you agro your dead :)

Well I dunno about that... 50% means he's as close to death as close to full
life..

Oh I know that argument well.. we had a bad run on the AoW and got some
pretty big flak on our servers boards.. 1 person in particular was in a
guild who'd killed AoW twice while we'd failed our attempts, and he was
particularly damning in his attack on us.

Of course we killed it the very next pop, went a long time unbeaten, and now
stand at something like 40-1 since the day he died

And the guy who tore us apart on the messageboards?  His guild poofed AoW
last week, didn't even get it below 60%.
We also FCFS raced them to him twice last week (server was down a lot) and
won both times, flawless kills.

Come to think of it, we've probably killed 13 of the last 15 Pops :)

I know how that is too.  We have a new rant on my servers boards that is
about my guild, 6000+ reads in 1 day, its growing at a phenoninal rate!
