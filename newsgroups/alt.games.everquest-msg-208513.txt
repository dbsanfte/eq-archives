Why not explore and find out for yourself?  A 40-ish Druid makes an
incredible explorer.  If you've already got a couple higher levels
and you're mostly interested in soloing I'd think that the idea of
being a lone wolf out to make his own way through the world would
be rather appealing.  That said, Timber Griffawns in Jaggedpine
should be decent xp and not terrificly hard to kill.  The wisps
there will be tough for you, but not unkillable, and they always
drop a GLS (9.5pp if you convert to book at gypsies in NK or Oasis).
Wolfform is a good idea in JP, some of the animals will KOS (at
least they will if you are a Human Karana Druid).  The Timber
Griffons will (very rarely) drop a 10wis range-slot item, but they
are tougher than the 'fawns and wisps.  (You probably want to avoid
melee with the wisps at your level, they proc a stun and a blind
and so can easily slaughter a L39 in leather).
