Hey Biz,

Do you understand what they're accused of?

As I read that log (and I read it all), the combat timeline ran like this:

CoH: Call of hero, player summoning spell, forces zone load (unlike a port,
for example) by design specifically to clear aggro.

Res: Ressurect, Heals 1500 pts, causes "res effects" a stat debuff and 5% slow,
also forces zone load clearing aggro

CH: Complete heal, restores all hit points, causes massive aggro.

Main tank buffed

Clerics take position out of range of AoE

Main tank attacks to build aggro to keep focus on buffed tank

Cleric CH's main tank, is summoned and dispatched. Main tank didnt have 
enough
aggro yet.

Other tanks join in, running with res effects up as res is used as a tank-timed
heal due to the request dialogue and takes precendence over an AoE used by the
warder.

Clerics CH main tank, Magicians instantly CoH clerics to clear aggro with a 
spell
designed to do precisely that.

Over the course of the fight several melee'ists die, the main tank is constantly
engaged in combat, several clerics are summoned and dispatched.

Finally Main tank dies. Everyone else is unbuffed and suffering from various 
effects
and warder proceeds to slaughter entire raid with no focus for heals from 
clerics,
etc.

Is cheat...
a) the use of CoH to clear aggro ?
b) res effects to prevent stacking of AoE ?
c) The clerics healing while out of range of the AoE ?
d) The combination of res/CoH aggro reduction keeping the hate list small 
(its an aggro clearer, rather than ar educer like jolt/evade)

I'm a bit confused ;)  I can see that b) and d) are... well.... kinda "cheesy"
 but they
dont leap out at me as exploits... someone was always in danger and 
melee combat, and as the battle demonstrates when he died it wasnt like the 
others were out of risk...

Confused,

Sui
