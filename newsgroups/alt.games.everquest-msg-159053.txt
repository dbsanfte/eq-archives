      Two of the Paineel teleports are broken:  the one from that room
to the half of town with the Cleric guild, mayor, and library, and the
one from that half of town to the other half.  Basically, going deeper
into town is a one-way trip.  /petition to get out, or, if you're below
level 10, find a way to kill yourself:  attack a guard, spell yourself
to death, or have someone else who can gate or teleport out come in and
duel you.
