Not unusual - some ISP's have crappy newsfeeds meaning they completely miss
a whole slew of articles. The one I use at work misses more than half but
when I go home on ADSL with iinet that newsfeed is good so I can catch up on
all the ones I did not see during the day. You can check Google Groups every
now and again to gauge how much you are missing out on but remember there is
a roughly 4 hour lag there between someone posting and it being viewable on
Google Groups...
