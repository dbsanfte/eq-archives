Hehe... damn that brings back memories.   Rewind 4 and a half years and that
was a scene you could see repeated nightly    Great to see the zone getting
some use again.    It's really one of the more beautiful ones they did.

The zone was always particularly trainy, especially if you're just learning
how to play in dungeons.   Probably quite a shock for the "Highkeep
basement - we're fine as long as not more than 3 people are afk at once"
crowd.
