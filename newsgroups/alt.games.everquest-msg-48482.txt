I got XP on my system and I love it.  Unfortunalty my TNT2 card won't work
with EQ if i use the new detonator drivers and the XP drivers suck bad!
It's all choppy!  Also the drivers for my SB live sound card make the music
and sound effects all blurry, but playable.  I'm sure in a few weeks when
new drivers get released for these it will be very smooth.
