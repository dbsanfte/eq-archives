There is indeed a sector who don't seem to like BC, but I suspect a
not insignificant proportion are from the kind of people who want to
press the "I Win" button and get instant gratification in a game.  The
whining section of society always seem to outnumber the happy section,
even in RL  :)  You only have to look at the "nerf this!" posts on the
(shudder) O-Boards to see this in action.
