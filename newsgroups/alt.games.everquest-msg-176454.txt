I started swarm kiting at level 40 using my level 39 charm.  I know
the level 39 one uses mana but it lasts longer.  Plus, I can swarm
kite mobs higher than level 37.  The Great Divide is a good zone to
learn how to swarm kite, right around the Nexus Spires.  Cast a DoT on
a mob and have it chase you.  A Drakkel Dire Wolf is a good mob to
practice with.  Now, find some other Drakkel Dire Wolves or Frost
Giants and run past them.  Keep doing this till you have a bunch of
mobs following you.  Whatever you do, do not switch targets.  Use the
original Drakkel Dire Wolf you DoT'd to charm.  Charm that wolf and
have it attack any mob in the pack.  Keep Selo's up and keep track of
your pet's health.  Once it get's down to around a bubble of health
break the charm, especially if you have a few Frost Giants beating on
it.  Run around in circles to keep the pack together and DoT the
nearly dead wolf to death.  Once that wolf has died, target another
mob and charm that mob.  Have that mob attack the pack.  If you happen
to charm a giant and he's beating on a wolf, slap a DoT on that wolf
so that you get full xp even if the giant kills the wolf.  DoT the
giant to death....rinse and repeat.  Unless you have SoW, remember to
keep Selo's up at all times and if you do this near the Nexus Spires
be careful not to target the Nexus Scion accidentaly and send your pet
to beat on it.  I did this once and I expected to die.  The Nexus
Scion didn't cast a spell on me but as soon as I got near her I was
punched for 1,967 points of damage.  If you accidentaly send your pet
to beat on the Scion, just zone.

I would suggest trying this swarm kiting only if you have a good
handle on regualr charm kiting.  My best swarm kite has been 3 Frost
giants and 5 drakkel dire wolves on my tail.  I beat them all without
getting hit once.  I'm sure there are other bards out there that have
had better packs to swarm kite.
