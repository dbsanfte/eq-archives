I think the point the OP was trying to make was why canni yourself when your
already FM ?

With a KEI and some basic mana managing my 28 shammy could stay almost
totally FM even when soloing.
Sure I could have not got a KEI for him, but then I would have had to wait
for my health to regen between fights, Just because someone is using all the
tools avaible to them doesnt mean they dont know how to play a class.

Would you tell a carpenter with an electric saw he didnt know his craft
because he wasnt using a hand saw ?
