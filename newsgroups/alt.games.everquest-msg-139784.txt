Oh that's what is bothering you, my choice of words intimidates you? 
Well why didn't you say so, lots of folks don't know fancy words and I
can try to keep em down to one and two syl.. err, I'll keep em short and
simple if I can so that you will be able to understand without getting
offended.  I don't know how far in the sand your head is buried today
but if you think that I have to look up the words I use, or that I would
do so for something as silly as playing whack-a-mole then you are far
more delusional than even your childish posting style would suggest. 
Rather than spending half an hour looking up words and reworking my
rough drafts till they are ready to post as you imagine, I just bang em
out, hit spell check and send.  If you are having problems understanding
all the big words  now just imagine how ugly it would be for you if I
really was doing what you accuse me of heh.


I'm sorry if the words I have used have hurt your pride since you had to
look them up, but please try to forgive me if I accidentally use similar
words in the future, as by nature I prefer to celebrate the english
language and all of its nuances in order to better make my points and
often forget that those such as you are left wondering what it all
means.  This is not to say that you don't have a point here, it is my
duty to form the words in a manner that you can understand and if you
have become as upset as you obviously have then I have failed in that
duty.  I assure you that in the future I'll make every effort to lower
the reading level required to follow my posts if you are involved in the
thread, but again I ask your forgiveness for any lapses as its been 40
years since I wrote at the kindergarten level.

th
PS:  Cute attempt at trying to co-opt my reference to you as a child,
but for it to work you really shouldn't have included a plea for me to
dumb down my posts so you could understand them.  The juxtaposition is
amusing in its irony as I'm sure you'll note once you get done looking
up juxtaposition.
