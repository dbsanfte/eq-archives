From your other post:

Now, you ruined my ramble about the Choice of the Half Elven (long
life as Elf and then nothing, or Human mortality and an Afterlife),
but you *still* got the family tree wrong. 

Luthien was child of Melian the Maya and Thingol Greymantle, leader of
the Teleri people. Thingol alone of their people had seen the Trees,
and his people became the Sindarin (grey elves) and were better than
the rest of the Moriquendi (dark elves = elves who never saw the
Trees). Beren and Luthien had a son, Dior. Dior married Nimloth,
kinswoman of Celeborn, and they had the sons Elured and Elurin and the
daughter Elwing. Elwing escaped the sack of Doriath. Tuor, son of
Huor, married Idril Celebrindal (silverfoot) of Gondolin and later
traveled with her to the West, he is alone of Men counted among the
Elder race, and he does not share in the Fate of Men (Afterlife).
Their son Earendil married Elwing and had the children Elros and
Elrond. Elros chose humanity and was the first in the line of
Numenorean kings and also ancestor of Elendil; Elrond chose elfhood.

Galadriel was daughter of Finarfin, who was the third son of Finwe,
Feanor's half-brother. She was counted amongst the greatest of the
Noldorin, and wiser than Feanor, and through her Telerin mother she
had a love of the sea. She was one of the leaders of the original
rebellion, and pride kept her from turning back or from accepting
pardon when it was given, so she stayed in Middle-Earth and thought
it'd be forever. Finally, after willingly rejecting the Ring, she
passed the last 'test' and returned to the West.
Anyway, she married Celeborn, grandson of Thingol's brother, at some
point (she met him either in Alqualonde or in Doriath) and moved east
with many Noldor, Laiquendi (or Green-elves. They were pretty damned
close to EQ wood elves: They were the elves of Ossiriand, wore lots of
green and used light armor, knew all kinds of wood lore etc. They were
the last of the elves to come to Beleriand after dawdling in the woods
around Anduin a while, and after their king fell in battle, they never
took another king, and some of their people moved to Thingol's realm
and merged with them) and Sindarin (or Grey-elves). They had the
daughter Celebrian, and she married Elrond. They had the sons Elladan
and Elrohir, and the daughter Arwen.

Aragorn and Arwen marrying merges one hell of a lot of noble lines.

See above.

Elrond's home is flavored by human influence moreso than Lothlorien,
and both places have roots in the Sindarin kingdom of Doriath (a
marbled hall if there ever was one). Lothlorien has more Green-elf
influence mixed with the Grey-elf style, in addition to the extra
Noldorin nobility.

And of course, everyone except Galadriel is a dark elf :)

UiB? I went there. I'll bet good money I know the owner of that
website, I'll have to check tonight.

As was the Balrog. The Valar were pretty much done with Middle-earth
and wanted to leave it to its own devices, and then Melkor (Morgoth)
decided to be powerhungry and keep meddling.

True. It'd be a world with lots of magic and very, very few magic
users, and HEAVY roleplay. I just happen to love that world :)

(ie. no, I am not looking for an EQ replacement...)

There's a Norwegian cartoon strip about this fantasy-obsessed, dragon
loving Goth chick. One of the strips in the Christmas album shows her
watching a TV report on the dangers of drugs and how they're so
addictive the user gets depressed when they have to return to the real
world. Final panel shows her thinking 'I know how they feel' and
clutching a copy of LOTR. I know how she feels.
