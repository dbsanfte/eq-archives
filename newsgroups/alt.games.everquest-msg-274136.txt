However it is perfectly legal to post a sign that says "we 
reserve the right to refuse service regardless of sexual 
preference, race or creed." After all, you do NOT have to tell 
someone why they are not going to get service with that wording. 
It all goes along with requiring a jacket and tie, or 'suitable 
clothes' When living in Virginia Beach, there were a fair number 
of places who would not serve you if you were in beach clothing 
[swimsuits and an oversized shirt, and sandals/flipflops, or cut 
off jeans and a tshirt] There was usually a descreet sign in the 
window saying 'proper clothing only'
