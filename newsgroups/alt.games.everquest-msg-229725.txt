Hmm these sound interesting:

Ranger Sub-class - Rangers are natural outdoorsmen and trackers, masters of
stealthy movement in the undergrowth. They use perception and cunning to
gain
the advantage over their adversaries.

(obvious this one I guess, ranger type has always been my first choice in
any rpg).

But now this sounds interesting..

Predator Class - Predators are relentless hunters who use stealth and
cunning to
stalk their prey. At home in the shadows, predators use the element of
surprise
to give their allies the upper hand.

Dont have time to go through the list properly but these are the ones I
would go for first I think :)
