And they should not impose their morals (or lack thereof) on others.  Yes,
there are filters in game (which leads to some strange results when hunting
in OT), but they are not very good (only filter correct spellings of the
naughty bits).  They don't filter emotes and other text well, at all.

I guess that you don't like No Smoking sections as that is just imposing my
need of a healthy environment on you, when I should just let you do whatever
you want, wherever you want.  Why is it that people think that just because
it's a game, they have no societal obligations to those around them (either
in RL or their in-game avatars)?
