What was your funnest day in EQ?[funnest  fun-est(adj)the most fun one can
have.ie "I have had the funnest day today!"]
Mine was at the orc mound near Kelethin.I grouped with some great
players.We fought the horde for nearly three hours before I had to leave.I
know that's sounds mundane but at 7th level it was the best.I'm 35 level now
and still look on it longingly.
