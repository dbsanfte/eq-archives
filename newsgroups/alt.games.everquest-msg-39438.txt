Um, did you miss this part of my post?

# 53 DWF PAL:  STA= 96, Swim=200, starts drowning in  68 seconds

# 1 DWF PAL:  STA= 96, Swim=  0, starts drowning in  68 seconds

# Wow, NO change in time-to-drown, despite a 200 point difference
# in swim skill, and a 52 level differential.

# Stamina is the only thing that determines time-to-drown,
# neither level nor swim skill matters in the least in
# determining time-to-drown.  QED.
