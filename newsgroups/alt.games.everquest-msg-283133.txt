Delay is a factor here.
Even though you're using Furious disc, for 2H weapons the damage is based on 
the damage of the weapon and the damage bonus--the latter is based on the 
delay.  Higher the delay, bigger the bonus, bigger the hits from ripo.

Something with shitty ratio but reasonable damage and absolutely insane 
delay would be perfect.  It should cost virtually nothing but with resolute 
and ripo, should hit like a truck.

As others posted A Weighted Axe from Kunark is a good choice.  It's 45 
damage but with a 150 delay should have pretty nasty damage bonus.
