  Ok, I know that I'm replying over and over again to this thread.  Sorry.
  Yeah, I know what you speak of here, Jekke.  I don't do the snob thing very well in
real life, and I have no intention of becoming one in Norrath.  My back story is that
while I come from a very wealthy and prestigious family in Felwithe, I got thrown out
in shame when I took up with Lenny.  I'm angry with my people for being so closed
minded, and rejecting (and trying to kill) my beloved without even attempting to
confirm my protests that Lenny actually has a good heart.  Thus, while I am by nature
and training a snob, I am actively trying to appreciate the value of all the people
of Norrath, and not hold myself as being better than they are (though I still, to a
degree, believe that I am).
   I am not a rabid roleplayer.  But I am fairly good at it.  Lenny is better at it. 
Believe it or not, I get chewed out fairly often on FV by other players for having
taken up with an Ogre.  When Lenny (the Traveling Ogre) and I are in Faydwer, he
generally raised the ire of the locals.  Many will not buy or sell to him (I'm
talking about PC's here).  Many /gasp when they see him on the path in GFay, and some
even /duel him regardless of what their level might be.
   Lenny usually replies by targeting them and /hungry /drool, which never fails to
get a reaction.  To the truly amusing people, he gives a gift of wood-elf parts we
acquired while I was working on my quest to get the  Elves of the OOT to accept my
beloved (they want to kill him, but I _know_ they will eventually come around).  This
usually results in horror, panic, and/or death threats to him.
   Fun, fun, FUN server.
