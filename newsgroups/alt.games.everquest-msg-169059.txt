I don't care for the key quests which involve camping various items,
and the more items you need the less I like them.  I have tons of
crap cluttering up my bank spaces and I'm not even sure what half of
it is, other than that its for some key quest or other.  Seb wasn't
bad, two parts both dropping in same zone, you just get a group and
camp it till everyone has the parts.  HS was a bit worse, two
annoying camps that take hours if you want to kit out a full group

Vex Thal and Veeshan's Peak, though... I ought to just go thru and
destroy all the pieces I have cause I'm not going to get the rest by
accident anymore, I dont hunt in those lowbie zones anymore!

Single group trials are interesting challenges, although they make
me wish my guild was more solid; they are better done with several
groups who can provide the full array of buffs/summons.  On the
other hand, at least they are better than an endurance test that
anyone willing to sit around doing the same things over and over
will eventually pass (leveling up, getting exp, key part camps are
all like that IMO)

Raid Force Flags: I like these the best.  Nice big event, mutual
cooperation, work together as a team, and all get the reward at the
end.  Terris Thule flagging is great fun and decent drops and exp
with a tight 3 group force.  The POI factory quest is fun too,
although I think it should have a 4 group top limit, "bring as many
as you like" takes away from the teamwork aspect and turns it into a
charity event.

Free Zone access... This tends to create empty zones and overcrowded
zones, as the "easy road" is discovered and everyone who has taken
that road all the way up continue to stay on it.  I like knowing
that most of the people in POV and POS had to work to earn entry,
had to actually perform their role in a group competantly
