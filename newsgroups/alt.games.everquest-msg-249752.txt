I always experience graphical corruption in Jaggedpine; basically the ground
isn't there, which makes hunting impossible. I'm hoping there's a texture
file/s i can delete to fix this? The check files facility doesn't help. I
sometimes have this with some of the textures in PoK. Other zones are fine.
Can anyone help?

p.s. I'm really happy with the changes Sony has made lately; I am having far
fewer DX issues.
