Just lost my first adventure since this thing started practically,
including a few hard ones). Have to admit I have seen so many combos
that have worked and was suprised that we lost this one.

As a 65 druid I get used to being the main healer, but when there are
more than two taunt/melee classes, and I am the only healer - making
it clear to them that one person needs to TAUNT, the others should
assist, and not taunt at all. Of course todays adventure included a
ranger that just got his epic and wanted to see how he did tanking (it
seemed). I kept asking him to stand aside and shoot, granted he was
only level 61, but still the crits on a bow would benefit us much more
- am I wrong here? Needless to say I was complete healing each melee
at least once per kill EACH. It was so silly, even with VoQ, and Mask
of the Forest, I was oom almost each pull. Would get to 30m then the
aggro would ping pong. Rinse Repeat.

I have had success in these without a slower even, had a group once
with 3 druids, had another with 3 monks.... I mean I thought this
would work with just about any combo, and it really does, just that
people need to know what everyone elses strengths and weaknesses are.
If I am a druid and main healer there have to be aggro rules in place
(i.e. one MT, NO OT since we can root/mez unless there is a cleric,
etc). I even have Spirit of The Wood which is kinda a group mini heal
(with DS), but even that is not enough - good in places where we get
multi-pulls.

Don't get me wrong, have run out of mana once or twice before in
these, just am not used to it, even as main healer. Just needed to get
this off my chest. Now back to EF :P
