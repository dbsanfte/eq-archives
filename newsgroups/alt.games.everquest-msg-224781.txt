Yep, Pack Shrew. I bought it at the BB camp for 36 points IIRC. The point
here for the OP is that these spells are purchased using adventure points
that are obtained doing LDoN adventures so I think he's going to want the
expansion to participate. What I don't know is whether these spells that we
buy are available through other means. I know, for example, that the Remove
Curse line can be obtained other ways.
