You can have up to 6 dots going at once, but of different types

Type 1, pre-50 fire dots:
Flame Lick
Immolate

Type 2, pre-50 magic dots (swarm line):
Stinging Swarm
Creeping Crud
Drones of Doom
Drifting Death

Type 3, post-50 fire dot:
Breath of Ro

Type 4, post-50 magic dot:
Winged Death

Type 5, epic:
Wrath of Nature

Type 6, Sporecaller:
Choking Spores

Shaman and necro dots will stack with most of these (necro dot/snares
including their epic will overwrite our epic, not sure about sporecaller
effect's stackability)
