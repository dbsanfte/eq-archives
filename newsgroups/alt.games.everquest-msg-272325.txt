I can easily solo that many oranges per hour in EQ2 at level 20/21.  I 
don't think that was the question actually though, I believe the question 
was regarding relative speed of advancement at equivalent levels between 
the two games.

When you compare the two games in that manner, I think you will find that 
they are pretty close in advancement speed at equivalent levels, at least 
in my experience thus far up to level 21.

One other consideration that is not mentioned in any of this, EQ2 has 
lots of quests which award decent amounts of xp.  When I go out soloing, 
I try to make sure I also have at least one quest to kill the mobs I am 
killing, preferably two quests.  That adds a nice bonus of several 
percent xp for killing 10 +/- of those mobs, and/or adds a nice status 
point gain.  Currently at level 20/21, I have been doing writs that 
require me to kill Steppe Beetles and Plains Snakes in Thundering 
Steppes, and, I have been doing a quest entirely located in Thundering 
Steppes that has been requiring me to kill any beetles, or any antelopes.  
So, I solo beetles, snakes, and antelope, and gain on the order of 2% xp 
per 3 or so mobs killed (con white to orange), and in addition, I get 
1700 +/- status points, as well as 5% or so xp for finishing up the local 
xp quest.  When I finish the local xp quest, I get another one, takes 
maybe 3 minutes round trip to get the new one.
