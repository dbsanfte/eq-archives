Oh, now with the insults.  Where was the incorrect assumption?  Was I wrong
in assuming that you were promoting a particular point of view, regardless
of whether you *actually* believed it or not?

Where did you claim to be debating a side?  When you entered this discussion
bringing up a particular point of view.  I would think this would be
obvious.  To tell you the truth, Rumbledor, I couldn't give a shit whether
you believe what you're saying or not.  I only look at what you're saying.
And I only respond to what you say.  If you weren't looking for a
discussion, you shouldn't have brought the point up in the first place.  And
you *especially* shouldn't have continued this discussion by responding to
me after I responded to you.

Seriously dude, who do you think you are?

I haven't acknowledged it because it doesn't make a difference.  This is
more "semantic bullshit".  No, sorry, it's just a disingenuous tactic that I
can't possibly believe that you're stupid enough to present honestly.
Again, who do you think you are?  Why should I care what you *really* think
when that's not what you're discussing here?

Again, I don't care what your opinion on this issue is.  I just care what
you post about it.  I can claim I don't care about anything here one way or
another, but frankly, I'm not so much of a chickenshit to posit that
argument when someone calls me on the perspectives I bring to the
discussion.

Debate, discussion, whatever.  You're being awfully defensive.  If it's not
even your perspective as you've so courageously mentioned two or three times
now, why do you even care if I prove that wrong?

You bring up a particular point as a perspective that should be considered
in this discussion.  I bring up an opposing perspective to show why your
point is invalid.   You try to prove me wrong, I respond, then you try to
change the parameters of the discussion, again, in an attempt to prove me
wrong.  I call you on it, using a fairly typical word used on usenet, and
you immediately start complaining that I'm not being reasonable and civil,
and later break out every single usenet cliche attack in an attempt to
discredit me.

Dude, you lost an argument.  It's not the end of the world.  And my ego?  As
if my ego's going to be affected by any discussion I have here.  Come back
to planet earth, dude.

Actually, I think you're trying to read a subtext that isn't there.  I was
simply being honest.  I don't care how you reacted to it.  I found your
response to be sad, ill-conceived and overreacting.  I hadn't noticed that
in your posts before, so consider me surprised, not pleasantly so.

Rumble, the point you were raising was being discredited, an utterly trivial
point that you yourself claimed you didn't believe, and then you got all
huffy and angry over the use of the phrase "semantic bullshit" on usenet in
response to it, and now you're getting even more huffy and angry when I
point out my utter surprise at this odd overreaction.  And you're probably
going to respond again, either even more huffy and angry, or more
pathetically, just to tell me that you think I'm a big fat jerk and that
you're going to killfile me.

Like I said, it's sad.

C

Oh, and one more thing, when you claim that efficiency in acquiring platinum
is relevant to this discussion, you've changed your parameters again.
Again, you were claiming it was the time involved in farming up silks or
platinum or whatever, but efficiency isn't time.  Efficiency is loot/time,
which isn't the same thing at all.  I hope that this helps clarify one of
the issues you so nobly discussed.  (Oh, and that last adverb isn't
sarcastic, you'll just have to take my word for it)
