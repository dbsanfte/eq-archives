Nope, you didnt read my whole post. The count is exactly the same on
http://station.sony.com , which has a link to the EQ site but thats about
all. So, that count is the number of people on the Station, not on EQ. There
are a lot of silly games on the Station, and I could see 97000 people poking
at it. Unless of course, they're publishing the EQ server data on the
Station homepage, which would make no sense at all. :) Yeah, they're
related, but not *that* related....
