Above level 10. Death means loss of equipment etc.

Suppose Im bound to Freeport, but find myslef in Rivervale.
Is it possible to offload all money, equipment etc in bank, get killed, and
re-appear in Freeport, go to bank and re-equip?
Or does the charactor also suffer loss of XP and other stats only to
re-esatblish everything by finding corpse again?

And Likewise suppose im bound to Freeport but wish to run to RV, long way
especially at night. Could i go without equipment, knowing death wouldnt
mean I have to find body somewhere in Forest or Commonlands with a non
equipped replacement charactor.
Arrive in RV and go to bank to get kitted out again?

Hope you understand my questios....
