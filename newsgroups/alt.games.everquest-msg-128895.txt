Do you have a secondary "MA" already? Your 55 War with /defensive
could hold the line longer than the Wiz if things go wrong and you are
short on tanks. Rage is one mob you don't want to lose out on.

If you have enough tanks for the raid, then play what you want (sounds
like the Wiz is your first choice). Have some fun and try something
new.

Good Luck and report back on how things go,
