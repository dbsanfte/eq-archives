They drop in the sewers, from a swirling red mass.  Don't go down there 
unless you have a serious team.  It's a nice place for a single group of 
well-played 60s, or two+ groups 57+.  We lost a 2-group team down there 
this weekend.  Once the first chanter went down there just wasn't enough 
time to recover.  The sewer camp is one of the few exp camps where I like 
having an enchanter along.  Normally I can CC just about anything, but 
there are two many mobs level 56+ there, and there generally isn't enough 
room for the cleric to root the adds away.

Hmmm, depending on how many people you're bringing, there are a number of 
decent camps.  I'm still not sure which are the best for drops, other than 
the sewers.  
I see quite a few groups setting up right as the zone-in, and I can't 
imagine why, other than just sheer ineptitude.  Nothing like zoning 
into a train pulled because a wimpy team fights like morons knowing that 
they're only 10 feet from the zone.  The two guards in the tunnel are the 
only ones you can easily pull from the zone-in, and once those are cleared 
you would do much better to move to the CY and set up by the tree.  Watch 
for respawn though, and space your kills out a bit so you don't get 
overwhelmed when a named pops and takes a bit to kill.  
There are several viable camps in the maze.  For a single group you can do 
well right at the port-in spot.  Don't overpull though, as leaving a train 
of mobs for the poor fool porting in is rather rude.  Another good camp is 
the ruins to the north of the spires.  Based on what I've seen, I would 
expect that there is room for 3-4 good groups in the maze alone.
If you have several groups you may want to try the Archon Pyrimid area to 
the north of the maze.  I scouted it with myself, a monk, and a rogue, and 
we couldn't figure out any obvious safe-spots, so I would expect you would 
need to break from the maze.  You should be able to pull the two guards at 
the end of the entrance tunnel without getting a roamer, and from there 
work your way to the west wall to set up.  Be careful, there are level 60 
mobs in there, though I hear some very nice items drop there.
A nice spot for a single, solid group is the throne room camp to the west 
of the courtyard.  You'll need to clear from the tunnel, and I recommend 
setting up in the right corner, but it's a very doable camp.  I've never 
broken it without a cleric, but I've had the cleric go LD about mid-break 
and stayed there with a shammy healing for 3-4 hours without much trouble.  
Pathing is a bit wonky here, as always, so be careful pulling from across 
the yard.
I haven't explored the Avatar Pyramid or gator pits, so I can't give you 
much info about them.  Some general info to remember is that mosquitos, 
brown lizards, and some spiders see-invis.  You can mezz most of the mobs 
here, but there are several mobs which are either unmezzable or very MR.  
Everything hits hard.  Once you break an area it's not that bad, but don't 
count on single pulls until you break.  Oh, and taunt works now, so you 
don't need an SK/Paly to tank.
