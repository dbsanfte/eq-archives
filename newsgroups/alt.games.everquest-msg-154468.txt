Honestly. If a friend of mine's in trouble with the guildleaders, it
should be up to him whether or not I know what he's in trouble for. A
guild leader trying to put a "gag order" on me if I get in trouble is
another clear sign I'm in the wrong guild. >< I understand being told
not to go blabbing about it publicly, but not being told I can't
discuss it with my friends.

Of course, I could also be reading too much into what Ryou said. ;-)
