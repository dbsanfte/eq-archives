Don't confuse the spammer with the service.

That's from an on-line poker player that has been given the ability to
recruit others with with incentives by the site. It's not a special
privelege. It's given to a huge number of folks. The method the
"affiliate" uses is up to them. The smarter ones advertise in forums
dedicated to poker. Advertising on a forum to people addicted to
another game that consumes a vast amount of time (leaving no time for
poker) is well, silly.
