	Actually, evolution is a fact.  Natural selection, punctuated equilibria,
etc. are theories intended to explain those facts, in much the same way
gravity is a fact and various theories of gravitation attempt to explain how
it works.

	That is absolutely correct.  It is, in fact, the position of every major
strain of Christianity that evolution is god's method of sculpting life.  It
is *only* the position of American fundamentalists that evolution implies
atheism.

	That is not necessary at all, and it is not even what most scientists
belive.  There is no greater statistical percentage of atheists among
scientists, even evolutionary biologists, than there is among the general
popluation.
