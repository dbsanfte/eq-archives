I've just started doing the quests for the Pine Scout armor. Ran
around Qeynos Hills all day today and have yet to find one Giant Field
Rat.

And now for some questions:

What kind of Gnolls drop the Gnoll Chain armor used for each piece? I
killed the watchers and the regular Gnolls outside of Blackburrow for
a few hours with no luck. I can clear the first floor and part of the
second floor of Blackburrow with little trouble, but I still haven't
found any pieces of the Gnoll Chain armor. With nothing but farmers
and bored high levels in there, I'm afraid to journey any deeper in
without a group and risk a potentially messy CR.

<minirant>
Has anyone else noticed that as soon as you zone into Everfrost from
Blackburrow, the tunnel is COMPLETELY BLACK!? Not even turning up the
Gamma in-game and the brightness on my monitor to max produces any
sort of guidance. I have a firebeetle eye in my offhand, but it makes
no noticable difference. Damn these human eyes if I have to run across
the continent to kill a few spiderlings, then run back to complete the
armor quests. Are there any other MOBs around the Qeynos area, other
than spiderlings, that drop spiderling silk? (Sewers, Wesk Karana,
etc...)
</minirant>

What are the stats on the armor? (if any) Would it still be viable to
purchase player-made Banded armor later on?

OT, but:
Someone in /ooc said the Gnolls in Blackburrow killed him to make
Barbarian steaks. Anyone know if recipies exist for the different
"racial meats" you can get by killing halflings, dwarves, elves,
etc...

Rock on all, and thanks in advance for any feedback.
