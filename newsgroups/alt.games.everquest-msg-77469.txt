Being that you are an Iksar I would suggest buying enough supplies (mainly
Drink as food drops) and all your level 8 spells. Get a port to Tox and hunt
in the Warrens you can be bound right out side the zone in Paineel. By the
time you are level 12 you should have enough faction to buy spells and
supplies in Paineel, and By level 16 you should have the Key to the
elevator. Warrens have plenty of mobs decent loot and good exp plus Paineel
necro guild is a heck of a lot easier to get to for trainning and spells in
the future.
PS save your Kobol Molars they build good faction once you get to a low
dubious faction.
