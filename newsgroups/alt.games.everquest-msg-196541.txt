First question is I've recently created a Froglok Shaman named Scrya
(imagine, no Fribbit-style name) and he's working through the newbie quest
in Gukta and I've gotten to the point where I need a Cracked Aquamarine.
I've killed tons of things in the zone (that a level 3 can kill at least),
Spiders, snakes, zombies and not seen a single one drop.  Wondering if
anyone else has run through this quest and knows where these things drop.
Also any websites out yet that give a walkthrough of these quests for each
of the classes?

Other question is my friend has been playing a necromancer and she is near
30.  Wondering when my Beastlord hits 39 and her Necro, 30, where would be a
good place for us to hunt.  Not looking to do this as a permanent duo, but
just for something fun to do with a friend.  Any suggestions are greatly
appreciated.
