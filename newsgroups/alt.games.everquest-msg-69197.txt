Happen to see if the level 39 mage pet spells were up there?

And I think they should have forced spell research. at least made the
spells themselves no drop. In exchange to making the words more
common.  The Concordance of Research (for practice research) was
broken for a loooong time. And ironically the quest to get it was one
of the most used quest of all time, back in the day.  /auc Buying GLS!

I'm still supriced that even up in the 50's most folks are suprised
when I damage shield them with my enchanter. "Enchanters get damage
shield? When they add that?" haha  And its a 39 spell. Tough to
reasearch, and mediocre, but its better than nothing.

At any rate, I'm despreatly looking for Words of Convocation on mith
marr. Paying entirely too much too. Take advantage of me in my moment
of weakness. :)
