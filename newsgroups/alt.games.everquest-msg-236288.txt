True PLing has always sounded boring as hell to me, and since I play the
game for the fun of it I'm not much interested in that. However what is fun
is what you might call "social powerleveling," where a high-level character
hangs around someplace like Crushbone helping a group or two of passing
newbies tear through the throne-room orcs for a couple hours. I've done that
a couple times, it's an entertaining break from the general exp grind. See
how many orc emissary corpses we can pile in one spot, see how long the
caster can be kept alive as tank, etc.
