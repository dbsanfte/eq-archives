Unless I'm missing some reason you should want to keep it, I'd toss out the
History of the Di Zok for a Stein of Moggok.  I know it's not too original
an idea, but the Stein is the cheapest item, on a platinum per Int basis,
that I know of in the game.  Runs about 200 plat for 10 int in the secondary
hand on Povar.
