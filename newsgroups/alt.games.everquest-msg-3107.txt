Being a good boy I went thru all posts in this thread to see if anyone
responded.  Amazingly not.

Yes, if you buy a stack of each of the four components needed to make
arrows and dont have any failures you will make 5 stacks of arrows
unless you are using Silver Tips to make magic or high damage arrows
which give you 10 stacks.

As to how often do I get 100%?  Granted that all arrows are Trivial to
me at 202, but I have been making about 10,000 arrows for sale each
month (often times more) an regardless of the type made (rarely more
that 4dmg 150rng are wanted - I stock 1 or 2dmg) I can make go as many
as 10 to 15 stacks without getting 1 failure.  Sometimes I can make
the 5 stacks and get 3 or 4 falures.

And you are right on one account and wrong on another.  

Yes, you basically only save one inventory slot as combining all those
ingredients would give you 5 stacks, even with a failure or 2 you
would still need that 5th slot.  Unless as I said you are making Magic
arrows in which case you are saving 6 slots.

The advantage comes in the weight and.  5 stacks of arrows weighs more
than 5 stacks of components IIRC (dont ask me how, I just give the
stats:>).  

As for the Ammo slot, that is where you are wrong.  Although you can
PUT a stack of arrows up there it will throw them back into your bags
except for 1 when you leave your equipment screen.  Then, as you fire
an arrow it just basically pulls up another one of the same type until
you run out of that type in your bags, much like I believe it does
with throwing knives and throwing stars (I am not going to try to
spell the actual name=>).
