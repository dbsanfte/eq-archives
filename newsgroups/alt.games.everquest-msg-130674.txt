Don't delete the character - the problem isn't there.

You need to make it clear to your guild that you'll be happy to port
before and after the event, but once the time for the event has
started, you're going to be *at* the event, and not playing taxi.

If your guild is worth being in, they'll understand and not try to
take advantage of you. If not, find another guild and perhaps they'll
appreciate you a bit more once you're gone.

Remember, you pay your monthly fee for *your* entertainment, first and
foremost.
