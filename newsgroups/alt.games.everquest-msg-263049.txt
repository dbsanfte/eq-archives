Oh, but there *is* a problem. EQ is a game, and its ultimate aim *as 
such* (not going into the whole "making money for SOE" thing) is to 
provide enjoyment for the players. Droppable equipment provides three-
fold enjoyment: to acquire it, to use it, and to pass it on (either for 
money, for friendship, or for twinkage). NO DROP equipment only provides 
the first two, and once obsoleted, leaves the player with a rather nasty 
feeling. Also, letting a tasty piece of gear rot because nobody can use 
it may be good for the overall economy, but it *feels bad*. 

Allowing the players to have an outlet for discarded NO DROP gear 
increases the general enjoyment of the game, and has little or no 
downside, if it's done carefully.
