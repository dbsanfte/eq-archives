One of the nastiest ones I saw recently was in Maiden's eye.  Repeated
trains of Goranguas (sp) to the zone eventually formed a group of about 15
there.  It was enough to drop any 50+ player in one round.  Unfortunately, I
was feigned there and every time someone zoned in they would be dead before
they could move.  Must have seen at least 10 people die :(
