I wish people would just drop the old old argument of:
"Warriors cant solo dark blues, but my monk can"

Well geee ummm... no kidding?! Yes, we can solo. We just have to use more
bandages. hehe. =P Second, we were not made to solo. We were made to protect
the group from dmg given by the npcs.  We were made to recieve dmg. Monks
job was made to deal dmg. Ugh, know your role that you chose at level 1
please!!

Joe Smoe saying stuff about how is monk was better at this and that warriors
and that warriors suck at pretty much everything.  Something about "Giving
dmg is more fun". Well maybe to you, but I like saving group ass and
taunting npcs. Sorry for venting guys! =)
