Ruins of kunark doesn't have very much for you right now. Unless you 
want to start an iksar.

Scars of velious has nothing for you until you hit about 30.

Shadows of luclin expansion is useful for the bazaar where you can go 
shop for gear, also it has teleporters to get you around a little. From 
qeynos you have a little bit to go to find a teleporter (either north 
karana or toxxulia forest, I would recommend the latter since you can 
get there safer). There are also a few very good exp spots from around 
say level 13 or so (paludal caverns most noteable). As soon as you get a 
little money that you want to spend on gear I'd say get luclin.

Planes of power has teleporters that can take you around the world 
safely which is a huge plus if you want to travel. Other than that 
there's not that much until you hit your upper 50s.

That said, I wouldn't recommend buying the expansions one by one, 
instead buy one of those "gold edition" packages or whatever they're 
called which include all the expansions in one.
