Certainly not.  Just pointing out that cleric is not a replacement for
either flavor of tank.  Adding some damage output to the
cleric contribution is all well and good, but if you want damage
get a damage class, if you want a sponge get a sponge class,
nice thing here is that if you were already considering a cleric,
you just got a boost.

I've often seen people say "for a real exp grind, don't get a cleric,
get a shaman" since their slow and haste combo turn a mob that
requires a cleric into one where a mere shaman can do the healing
job just fine, and they contribute a lot more damage output.  Perhaps
now a cleric will be just as desirable for an exp group at the high end.
