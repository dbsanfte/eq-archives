It was mostly amusing to see the killer croc shooting across the desert to
kill things for me, and newbies going "wtf" to seeing 2 crocs fighting each
other.

Indeed, charmed pets are great, I had a charmed soothebrine seahorse in
Kedge that held for nearly 9 minutes, of course this is right after we
killed the tainted seahorse and the corrupted poofed to somewhere halfway
across the zone, WTG VI.  Later found it in the tube near Cauldronboil that
goes up to the frenzied shark room.  Apparently the cleric who was with us
needed the crystals for her bot druid, but we wiped on the corrupted after
someones bot wizard hit supernova instead of ice comet (nice train!), I
managed to evac myself and the warrior though, anyways, we were killing the
green fish at the zone in to pass time while someone was trying to get a GM
(apparently they thought we deserved GM rezzes because the corrupt popped in
the wrong place, didn't get them, duh), I pulled one of the piranhas at the
bottom of the first tube and swim back up.  Warrior starts killing the
piranha and the corrupted seahorse starts beating the crap out of me, wtf.
I zone to clear agro and suggest that the other guys do the same (at this
point there's 54 druid - me, 60 baron warrior, 54 mage and 57+ wizard that
showed up to join us when Phinny spawned;  Anyways, we killed the corrupted
(barely, I was oom and warrior at less than 10% health when he died).
Cleric zoned in with around 6 min left on corpse, no one is saying anything
when I ask if it's ok for me to loot until about 2 minutes left when someone
(not the cleric) says go ahead, so I do.  An hour later some guy starts
talking to me "Congrats on your piece but the cleric isn't happy" (the
cleric had camped like 45 minutes earlier).  He acts like he knows me
(apparently he's the clerics RL husband), which just confuses the hell out
of me, he's like "I grouped with you before".  WOW, have a cookie!  At least
I got to see Phinigel go down like a deep fried catfish later (one death,
the other druid who tried to burn him down from 30% fast), grats to those
guys who got epic sticks, and somebody else for looting the ore with 15
seconds left on corpse, oh, and whoever took the uber chanter page 400 too
*rolls eyes*.

Sorry.  I have a tendency to ramble a lot.  And forget stuff.

Killing it off yourself, that would've been my preferable path, but I was
more concerned with using my last visible sliver of mana to gate, after
getting 3 gimpy charms in a row ( under 20 seconds each).  As low as I was
getting on health, even had I landed snare on it I couldn't outrun because
of the low health snare effect on myself.
