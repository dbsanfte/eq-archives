As others have pointed out, there isn't really an "alignment" in EQ like
there is in some MUDs.  Instead, there is "faction".  Mobs and NPCs can be
on various factions, and doing quests or killing other mobs and NPCs can
raise or lower various other factions.

For Neriak, the guards are on "Dread Guard Inner" and "Dread Guard Outer"
factions (one is the guards in Neriak, the other is the guards in Nektulos. 
I think).  There are probably other factions for the various caster guilds
and whatnot.

Also, your character, depending on race/class/religion, may already have
faction high enough to wander around in Neriak.

What spells are you trying to get?
