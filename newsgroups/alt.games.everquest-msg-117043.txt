I'll give you that back before they upgraded the graphics that night
blindness was fairly major issue.  But since the fix, my ranger very
rarely bothers with Eyes of the Cat and he has no lightsource on him
at all.

I wouldn't say humans have ho hum stats.  They have the highest
starting strength and are tied for the highest stamina.  Human rangers
have decent agi, which isn't a big deal since they get a pretty nice
agi buff at level 15.  Dex is a sore point, but as I said, there is
lots of pretty good ranger gear out there that gives dex.  Wis could
be better, but in my 46 levels of play that hasn't been an issue.  I
will concede that might be different in the high end game though.

Heh.  I'm spending quite a bit of time on the defensive here lately.
First defending my rangers race, then defending the druid class in
general in another thread.  Maybe I need to back off on the caffeine.
