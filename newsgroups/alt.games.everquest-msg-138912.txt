 In most cases. However, don't designate the Monk as puller on
everything just because they are the Monk and you think they should be
pulling. For example, Bards make better pullers in PoG than Monks. In a
lot of cases anyone can pull just as well as a Monk.

 Bad advice to immediately run back to the group unless you know for
certain that all other mobs are no longer aggro. It's sort of fun to
pull one golem in ST back to the raid only to have another one warp on
top of you 30 seconds later. A lot of the times the puller wont be
engaging in combat, instead simply pulling mobs for everyone else.

 Depends on how your other members are equipped. I'm geared for max DPS
on most raids. ie, dual-wielding fast 1handers with a proc, and main
tanks don't have problems keeping aggro. If I do get aggro I can usually
FD them off or step out of range.

 If I were coming back for a heal I'd probably get a CoH if I was far
away or FD in healing range and then ask for a heal so that I don't
transfer aggro to the cleric.

 Oh, also may want to ask bards to turn off ae songs before going out to
pull. Trust me on that one.

 Don't forget debuffs like Fixation of Ro and Ro's Smoldering
Disjunction. Also, don't damage shield the main tank unless they ask for
it. They only get 15 buff slots and those fill up fast. A lot of times
they have room for a DS, but sometimes, mostly with mobs that cast
dots/debuffs, that DS they didn't really want could prevent a Heal Over
Time from landing on them.

 I have no idea what Paladins do. As long as the Brells me, they can
stay!

 True. I can think of more than one instance where Snare (Darkness) + FD
make for some easy splits that would be hard with a Monk. Mainly in
those zones that have the anti-split code or whatever you call it, where
if they lose aggro the immediately go back to their spawn spots instead
of hanging around and going back one at a time.

 Enchanters die a lot, as well. This is often referred to Tashicide.

 Uh.. Sorry, but I'll have to disagree with most of that.

 You forgot mod rods.

 The air pet can stay but if they get an earth pet out we'll have to
hurt them.

 As a Monk who doesn't like ripostes, I'm not in the front of the mob.
It takes a bit more work at managing aggro though. If you suck at aggro
management, stay in front.

 Well even those roles aren't the same from raid to raid. You didn't
really specify which sort of raid levels you were aiming it towards.
