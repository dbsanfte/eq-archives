*shrug* And? There's only one that gives any noticeable amount of xp
that I know of. Why force necromancers to either bend to the demands
of greedy newbies or sit and farm newbie grounds - taking kills from
those who actually get xp off the mobs - to get their pet reagents.

One idea that has been proposed before has been a spell to turn a
corpse you have loot rights to into a set number of norent bone chips.
Either that, or "chunks of meat".

Why is it only skeletons drop bone chips? It's not like other
creatures don't have bones. Just gotta "dig" a bit for them...
