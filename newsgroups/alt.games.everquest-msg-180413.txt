Several ways.  The one that would impact game performance the least is one
that I've used for other games.  Have a TV card and a regular video card
with TV out, feed the TV out back into your TV card and "watch" (and record)
as you play.  Interestingly enough, this is also a way to play a game in a
window that normally doesn't have that ability.  :)

Simpler, and even less impact on performance, though more of a pain as it
adds a second (time-consuming) step, is to just "TV out" into a VCR, tape
it, then feed it back in and digitize it.

The most complex way, but what will produce the best results if you're
looking for quality video, is a direct capture of the video stream.  If you
could do this, you wouldn't have needed to ask the question anyway.
