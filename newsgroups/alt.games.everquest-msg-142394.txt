Perhaps, perhaps not. The world changes pretty fast these days, and
dinosaurs have trouble keeping up.

Don't be too sure. The act of fighting piracy is a way to stop losses,
not to earn income. And fighting piracy in the courts isn't cheap, nor
even particularly effective.

Sales of individual MP3 files. I'd be happy to spend, oh, fifty cents
per MP3 file direct from the source. Especially if I can say to myself
"I'd love to have a copy of that song", and be able to go receive a
high-quality download of it instantly without having to search all
over. I'm sure I'm not alone in that.

The RIAA could pretty much pocket all of it, less bandwidth costs and
royalties. And they wouldn't have to share those profits with
distribution middlemen, stores, or packaging companies. Make a single
MP3, stick it on a high powered web site, and take the checks to the
bank. Pretty simple business model.

And I don't think that it would kill the CD market, either. The
availability of MP3s hasn't kept me from buying CDs. I like having
master-quality recordings of an artists complete work. And many times
I've discovered songs on a CD that never received air-time, but were
far better (IMO) than the song I bought the CD for in the first place.
And again, I'm sure I'm not alone.

True, but don't discount the power of marketing on the web. Consider
the very modest example of my own web site - it gets on average 15,000
hits per month. Do you know how much marketing that required? None -
it was all word of mouth. An individual artist or small group could do
the same with their music.

Besides which, marketing via the web doesn't preclude traditional
avenues in any way.

>You can't sell lots and lots of your music if nobody knows about

From the individual artist who is relatively unknown, it's quite
possible that they'll make more money by the "underground" methods
than through being backed by large corporations. There are artists who
pull SRO audiences for live shows, due almost entirely to
word-of-mouth who you will virtually never hear on the radio.

Are they getting rich? Certainly not. But they're doing what they
love, and making a living at it. And that's enough for many artists -
to be able to support themselves the way they want.

>We'll see if they ever actually DO get bitch slapped, though.
>So far, they seem quite effective at buying the government.

Yeah, I was kind of noticing that too.
