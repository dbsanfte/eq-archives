That's not really the problem. My rogue can dish out sizable damage (backstabs
frequently in the 100-200 ranger with a crap weapon) but the main trick is
that she can keep this up indefinitely and will have virtually zero problems
with agro while doing so. In an xp grind group (which is only a single element
of the game) a melee heavy group is obviously superior.

The best group i've been in had two warriors, two rogues, cleric and shaman
and the rate at which mobs were dropping was insane. Mind you, several of
the players were good and that makes a huge difference as well.
