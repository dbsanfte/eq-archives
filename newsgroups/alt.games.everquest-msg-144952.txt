Ooooh.  I'll sign yours if you sign my "give dark elf girls hats that 
look like ribbons in their hair" petition.  I was admiring her the other 
day and thinking how a ribbon holding up some of her hair would look 
sooooooo cute, although it might look even better if they made it static 
and made it change color with the robe.  I think Verant needs some girls 
in there designing clothing as well as the guys in there making up the 
silliest hats possible (ie, that hat that wood elf rogues get that looks 
like they slapped a bird over their head - the hell?)

Hey, wanna go play Barbies?
