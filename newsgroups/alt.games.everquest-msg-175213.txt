It isn't a run-on sentence.

"Perusing" is quite funny, mind you, and "utterly atrocious" utterly
over-eggs the atrocious pudding. But it's all part of the parody: I'm
reminded of the style of a retired Lieutenant-Colonel waxing
apoplectic on the Times' letters page about the degeneracy of today's
youth.

"What really needs to be done is to recognize that rape isn't a big
deal and stop kowtowing to every fucked in the head bitch who cries
"rape!"  Stop supporting the rape industry and send them to get
regular jobs.  Make the punishment a $20 fine like a parking ticket,
about what the "crime" deserves."
   - Bob (bobx23456) advocates rape in soc.men
=====================================================================
"While Bob's position sounds extreme, he does have a point that rape
is given far more importance than it deserves. How many men would
spend their lives crying if a woman forced them to have sex with
them? Or worry about prosecuting their wife if she forced him to have
sex with her?  The rape hysteria says more about women's frigidity
and lack of respect for men's sexuality than it does about the
severity of the crime.
