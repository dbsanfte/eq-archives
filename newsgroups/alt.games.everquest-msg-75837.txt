the whole problem with adding new features to the game is the database.
Right now, the database that drives EQ is HUGE. Adding one more slot to all
bank accounts would cause such an growth that the database would crash and
burn. Adding a whole new system of housing, who owns what and where and what
is placed in them, is so far beyond that, it just isn't funny anymore.

Whenever designing new features you want put in the game you have to keep in
mind that it must not and cannot mean an increase in database. So no extra
storage room, no extra spell slot, no 10+ slot containers no player made
permanent changes to the environment (houses) and so on and so forth.

Pity really, although when looking at horses, I don't think any player could
afford even the simplest of hovels.
