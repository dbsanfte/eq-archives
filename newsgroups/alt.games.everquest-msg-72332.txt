How are critical hits calculated?  My 12 Warrior just had his first critical
hit, using a 2hs Great Sarnak Cleaver. His 2hs skill is only 23, yes I was
trying to raise last night since I was in a good group.  I have never seen a
critical hit on his main weapon a Frozen Long Sword, which has lightly
better dmg/delay stats, and his 1hs skill is in the 50's or 60's.  Was the
critical hits because I was using a 2hs, or just because of me levelly?

Thanks.
