> Power leveling.

Using a high-level character to "babysit" a low-level character, enabling
the low character to earn experience very quickly.  (In EQ1, this is
typically achieved with damage shields and frequent healing.  I don't know
what the exact tactics are in EQ2.)

> Kill stealing.

Killing a mob that someone else had already engaged, or killing a mob from
a group of mobs someone had already staked out.

> Buff bots.

A secondary character, often run from a second computer, whose only purpose
is to follow your "real" character (or group) around and hand out buffs.
