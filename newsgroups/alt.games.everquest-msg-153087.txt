Hi Kev,

You didn't say who had set up your system and how it's configured, and this is only a guess, but could be a few reasons for this.
Here's just a few causes/solutions to get you started....

If *you* installed the board the first thing I'd check, is to see if it's seated in the slot properly, if it's not seated properly,
heat expansion could slowly break contact between the card and the slot it's plugged into (You'd be astonished at how many finicky
computer problems can be cured by reseating cards, chips, etc. Heat/cold expansion/contraction can and will push cards and chips out
over time) Be sure to ground yourself to the case before touching anything inside, and of course your machine will be off when you
try this *grin*.

Next I'd try putting a great big fan in your case to blow cool air across your vid cards GPU/RAM, as the problem as you state it
gets worse with time, it could be caused by overheadted.

Last but certainly not least, go to NVidia and get the latest Detonator drivers for your vid card. The ones that come with the card
are invariably outdated.

Hope you can solve your problem....
