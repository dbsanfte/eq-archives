For me it's ATI 128 Pro series, 32MB, and "Soundblaster Live!"
WinXP / 900Mhz Athlon / 512MB / ASUS A7V

Numerous graphical problems, no gamma correction, recently I'm not even
getting textures on some characters, sound is now choppy, reverb doesn't
work right, and some sounds overpower others like when it rains that's all I
hear and I must turn my volume down.

My system works brilliantly on the latest 3D games, EA's NHL 2002 looks &
sounds awesome! Now why can't Sony/Verant do the same job with EQ? EQ
doesn't have nearly the quality of graphics of the leading 3D games. I'm not
sure why they MUST use DirectX8.1, the latest version at that!

I've never had a problem with any EA or Activision game. Is it just that
Verant has bad programmers? HMMMMMMM!
