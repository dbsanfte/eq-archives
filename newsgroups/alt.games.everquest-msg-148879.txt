And how is that different from twinks of "serious" players?
Any "serious" player who wants to level another character can
do so easily on all but the single character servers, assuming
they've already leveled up one, and can level them up to the
same level as people who have spent months getting there in
days.  And, if they know what they're doing, they can do that
AND make sure they have all their spells AND make sure they have
all their essential skills maxxed.  It's not that difficult to
raise any skill you regularly use, even if power-leveled.  And,
as familiars pointed out, even people who "worked months" didn't
always have maxxed skills in non-essential areas.

So, you already play with people who "bought" fully leveled and
trained characters, at just about any level you want to name.
They just "bought" them with knowledge of the game instead of
money.  And it sure hasn't "ruined the game" yet, has it?
