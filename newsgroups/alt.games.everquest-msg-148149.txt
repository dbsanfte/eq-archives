that's +10 dex, +10 agl,  +5wis, +5 int, +5 sta, +30hp... all without taking
an equipment slot! :o)

No... force feeding counts half... so by eating 2 back to back, all you're
doing is resetting the timer to 'x'
You'd have to force feed 4 items to set the timer to double 'x'.

Yes it is

Nobody knows for certain what 'x' is for the various grades of food or
drink... closest I have seen is here....

ic
(I know that's gonna wrap... just cut'n'paste to your browser)

Max value of 'x' would only be a guess

There are a couple of variables...
Race matters (only Vah Shir have been confirmed by Verant... other races
have annecdotal evidence)
Zone weather matters (eg, you drink more in N Ro/Oasis/S Ro)
