Ah, breakdown in communications. Sorry. My bad. I was following up on
the OP's question and wondering *whether* the new Kane Bayle server
would be split or not. My original thinking was "no" since they wanted
the Euro's to be able to *move* to a server with better lag, etc. But
since they have that with AB, I think it's possible that this one might
be fresh.

That, of course, leads to the question, how many non-Euro's will run to
start characters there if it's a fresh one. And again, I restate my
opinion that the folks who want to do it to "get away from Uberguilds"
will be disappointed because there will be at least one within a few
months anyway. (experienced powergamers would be well into Kael with a
raid force by then anyway.). But yeah, I see your point. Transferring to
a split server with ten friends could definitely make farming easier for
a while.
