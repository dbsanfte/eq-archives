The friends list is stored on your computer in a file named
<character_name>_<server_name>.ini, for example wulfbones_nameless.ini
would be for my character. It is stored in your everquest directory.
Just copy it to a floppy and copy it to the computer you want it to go
to. Each character has it'sown friends list.
