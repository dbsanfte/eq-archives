Nope, they just get to summon an animal pet at level 9.  Type of
animal depends on the race.  Cat people get a tiger.  Barbarians get
a wolf.  Ogres get a bear.  Trolls get an alligator.  Iksar get a
scaled wolf.

>How do normal animals see a BST (amiable, warmly, indifferent) ?

Normal animals mostly see beastlords as an entree.
