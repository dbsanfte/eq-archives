You're giving me very good reasons to consider a Shaman instead but
maybe I'm misrepresenting my position. My Paladin is basically a
loner. The secondary character (Cleric/Shaman/whatever) is not going
to be an adventuring character. The only time my Paladin will call
upon him is when he needs a Rez. The Paladin is my highest character
and I was going to use him for Powerleveling the newbie healer so that
said newbie healer can get to where he can be called upon in an
emergency.

Again, I don't plan on "two boxing" these characters. The only time I
would be doing this would be to level up the healer, not to use 2
characters at one time in a normal adventuring mode. Hell, I have a
hard enough time handling one character at a time, let alone two!

A Paladin's Lull spell might be helpful here to reduce aggro?

Definitely helps, though I'm not sure I want this healer to be any
more than a personal servant. :)
