I got a little list lying beside my comp for the same reason.
I mainly use the ignore list for spamming morons in NFP (the kind that 
think its fun to span "PLZ GIMME MONEY" every 5 sec). But for real 
morons, i dont add them on ignore, i have a list with their name, and 
the reason theyre on it.

So when theyll someday need a favor, i can tell them exactly why im 
gonna leave them stranded in WW place like that.
