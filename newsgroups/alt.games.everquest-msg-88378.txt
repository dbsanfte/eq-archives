Yes, it is.  Personally, I use Codewright which is highly customizable, you
can even make it act like that nasty vi editor.  Everyone has their own
personal preference, I just always hated vi, from the first time I tried it.
I have used emacs quite a bit too, but not for some time now.  Anyway, this
religious discussion has gotten way OT for EQ.
