A duo my daughter and I are having fun with is necro/mage (or necro druid at
other times). We have some very serious dps going and have a good bit of fun
trying to kill each other (I took over the necro after she trained me to
many times and fd'd at my feet... child is pure evil!) The classes damn near
seem built to duo together, we can straight out tank the mobs with mage pet
if yellow or lower cons till around 50, above 50 we started agro kiting or
fear kiting where agro was going nuts. between necro dots/taps and mage
nukes and the combo of pets mobs drop extremely fast. Never a dull moment
though playing with a 10 year old, but she's getting to be a good player
hehe :)
Seriously, we are having a great deal of fun with this combo.

Ocura- 65 human (doh) mage- 7th/Lanys
