Make your way back to the Rathe zone line. My guess is that, at level
twelve, you can't afford the coffin to summon your own corpse (it will run
you around 170pp). Politely ask if someone is willing to retrieve your
corpse for you. Explain that you're a newbie, and didn't realize that Rathe
was not a good place for a 12 to be adventuring, and that you'll be very
grateful. Be patient - more than likely, someone will come save your tail.

Now, that said, there is a risk to this method. You need to /consent whoever
agrees to do it, and there's always the rather slim possibility that they
will be mean and drag your corpse into an even more dangerous place (I've
heard of this happening, but it's exceptionally unlikely). If they do, well,
summon corpse still works.....

If you're on Povar, drop me a tell in game and I'll come get it (I can
locate it myself).
