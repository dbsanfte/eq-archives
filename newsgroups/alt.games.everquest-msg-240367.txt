Obviously you seem to have concern enough to respond with this barking.

If your no noob then 30k would be pfft, obviously it's not.

  They are a common drop that are easily attainable.

I see so your going to go score a spiked seahorse belt as a common drop,
that I would like to see.

My point was all haste belts and items in general which SOE is replacing
with easy common fabled drops is not helping the longevity of the game but
hurting it in more ways than one, but I can see how a noob wouldn't get the
whole picture.

It is, tell me were you impressed with the GoD exp. oh sorry I forgot your
still a noob and have yet to see how the promises of some quality expantion
efforts were being made for the seasoned vets.

  If he feels that way then please, don't let the door hit

Yeah and screw you too, what have you contributed to the game beside maybe a
three month pre-paid game card or thirty day free trial your still using.
