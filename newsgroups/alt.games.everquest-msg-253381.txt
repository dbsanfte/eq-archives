Originally the 'vision' was no numbers would show for *anything* but they
never got around to implementing it. Detect magic and Identify
were two spells that were part of this; beyond just using it
and seeing how well it worked detect magic would tell you if the
item was magical, identify would give you more details (higher
level spell).

Player experimentation was the way to find out what stuff did; there
were no descriptions for spells, fewer numerical values given, no
external log to parse, etc.

I kind of like that ;) But no, even in beta numbers were shown and
they even added in 'kludge' reports for things that weren't present
to allow better testing (a snake says 'hit by non-melee damage for 59 points!')
