1.  Get MGB.  No, I'm not saying don't raid without MGB, but get MGB, 
you'll love it.

Hopefully, you aren't announcing and casting buffs before the raid leader 
has said which buffs to use... that always seems to get the ball rolling 
for us.  The clerics sit there waiting for the call to either MGB symbol 
or 9/K.  Then the non-mgber's take care of latecomers (who will never be 
in the same group as each other) and people who were /afk slightly out of 
range of the MGB (who suck anyway) and people who still hadn't been 
rezzed from the previous raid mob/the accidental train/their own 
stupidity.  Oh yes, and all the paladins who insist that they want virtue 
instead of 9/K.

3 stacks of peridots later... :)

...But, an hour on my Kazad is a pretty fresh Kazad, isn't it?  And I 
ain't clickin' my 9's for your nasty nasty virtue...  I'll just eke out 
the last of that FT6, then bug a druid for more. :)

Heh.  On the other hand, this has happened to me time and again.  I log 
in, OTM has already been called, so I'm running to catch up.  I get to the 
raid, and watch all my buffs from yesterday go poof.  So I bug a cleric.  
I wat a couple minutes, then bug them again.  A minute later, I try a 
different cleric, and a couple minutes after that I hear UBERFIEND INC!! 
So I bug a -third- cleric.  Then either 3 Kazads land on me 
simultaneously, or (more often) I get to charge into battle unbuffed.  
Yaaaaa!

No point buffing the sacrificial gnome anyway, I guess... :)
