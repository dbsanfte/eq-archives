Nice work - way to put words in my mouth and totally misrepresent the
situation in a lame effort to portray a very reasonable rule in a bad
light.

Let's say I've attended 54 of the last 90 raids (60%)
Then RL interferes and I can only attend 4 of the next
10 (58 of 100, or 58%).  Given that we have 4 raids a
week, how long is it before I get back to 60%?

Quick hint - 4 straight raids and I'm there.  Am I being
screwed during those raids? No.  Why?  Because I accrue RPP
that I can spend the moment I get back to 60%.  Hell, I've
gone more than 4 raids straight without getting loot because
nothing's dropped that's worth the stinking RPP to me.  
Especially since the Rhags just gotadded to our "All hands
on deck" list, and one drops a VERY nice mage item that I
want.

I realize you left a guild because you didn't want to raid
with your cleric.  But I joined this guild knowing full well
the raid policies.  They are geared toward advancing as a guild.

Are they perfect?  No.  As we approach the end of the year it
is possible to get far enough behind to make it difficult to
get your raid percentage back over 60%.  Did the officers just
say "screw you" when this flaw was pointed out?  No, we have
a policy that allows people to go inactive while RL problems
keep them from raiding, and not lose ground.  We are also
experimenting with allowing people to buy raid attendence 
percentage points with RPP - so if I'm at 59% and something
I really want drops, I don't have to wait for my percentage
to reach 60, I can just buy the 1% attendence credit, then
bid on the item.

For those people who scream "but I have a life outside EQ!"
12 raids every 5 weeks is hardly a lot of time.  Unlike my
previous family guild we assemble on time, prep quickly and
are actively raiding very promptly.  Our weeknight raids start
at 4pm pst and rarely keep me in game past 9pm.
