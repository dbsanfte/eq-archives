Or maybe the made it, and I missed the message.
   Last night, July 24, at about 7:00 pm PST, there was a system wide
message saying that they were close to setting a record by having
100,000 people aboard all at the same time, and asking everyone to call
their friends, family and guildees to log on to push us over.  This plea
was repeated a couple to times, with various rewordings, over the course
of the next 2 hours.  I don't think they hit it.
   I thought it odd they would make the announcement at all.  Since they
took the server numbers away, they're the only ones who know how many
are on at any given time.  If they want to release advertising or
something bragging about how many are ever on, they can pull any number
they like out of the sky.... right?
   Anyways, this sorta gives a reference point to those who say that the
EQ numbers have been taking a nose-dive.  Pretty sure I saw someone say
that a while back.

Annie <--- Also pretty sure most of the < 100,000 were in the Bazaar. 
Shopping is fun!
