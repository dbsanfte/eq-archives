I just got back from seeing LoTR. And I'm going again tomorrow night! It's
been sooo long since I read the book (20 years maybe) that I was a bit lost
in following who everyone was. I have the book now, so I plan on
reading/skimming tomorrow to get the gist of what I missed.

Only one thing struck me as jarring, and that wasn't with the plot or the
screenwriting, but a cast character choice. The gentleman who plays Lord
Elrond (sp?) also played the nefarious Agent Smith in The Matrix. The entire
time I watched him, I kept expecting him to straighten his lapels, crack his
neck and adjust his sunglasses. Hmm... maybe I've seen the Matrix too many
times.

I also had a thought, while watching the fight with the orcs in the mines --
it's one of my pet peeves with EQ, but I'm **just** as guilty as the next
guy, so I'm not bitching or venting, just running my mouth... I kept
thinking "what if Gandaalf or Frodo or Striker or one of the others had to
stop and pull out a piece of paper and say something like "oh, here we go,
see, we've finished this part up to here... now, the next step is to shove
the skeleton in the well... after that, we go find the falling down bridge
and, hey Gandaalf, as our only caster, *you* have to try to kill the other
thing that comes after us, it's too high in level for us, and we can't hit
it without magical weapons anyway". Sometimes... sometimes, I really really
wish that our quests were surprises. I really really wish that we couldn't
consult the scrap of paper or have someone whisper in our ear the secret
words. I know, yes, I could do the quests without looking or asking. And I
know *damn* well that I should. But as so many others, I am weak... and
sometimes leveling or getting that next great item really -is- part of why
we play. But it would be great to have a great adventure. It made me look at
my halfling differently, though I won't play her any differently. I think I
was doing ok with her even before I saw LoTR. Though I may add a battlecry
to my socials ;).

I also think it would be really cool if chunks of cement were to fly off
when we were in a dungeon and we hit the wall with swords or axes when we
missed the mob ;->

All in all, it was a *great* movie. And I -will- go see it again.

Thanks for playing.
