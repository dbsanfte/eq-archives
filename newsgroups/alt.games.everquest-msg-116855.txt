Actually, seeing corpses with 3 hours is a big hint that Verant's timers are
fucked.  When you die, you go right to "Loading, Please Wait" state.  You
can't type commands during that time.  Even if the first thing you do upon
showing up at your bind point and gaining keyboard control is to /q, you
should use a few seconds on the timer.

While I can believe that some people get so pissed off at death that they
pull the plug on the modem or something, no way are there enough of those to
account for the number of 3 hour corpses I've seen.  3 hour corpses are very
common.
