    The workaround is hitting shift-alt-R, the same as if you were trying to
free the cursor when in windowed mode. That's assuming you're talking about
the same bug as I'm thinking of. You can see their attitude, though - if
there's an easy workaround for the user, the problem drops to the bottom of
the priority list.

    The top players are too good, and too informed, for expansions to last
long any more. An expansion is only considered "fresh" until the top content
in it has been defeated. As long as the devs give out inside information to
their friends in top guilds, and design expansions without a strong
weighting to the top-end stuff, the trend will continue. I doubt we'll ever
see another Velious, where the top content was defeated just as the next
expansion came out.
