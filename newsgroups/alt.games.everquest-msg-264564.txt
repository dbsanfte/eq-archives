    Thanks, Mary.  I'm sure your sound advice will stem the flood of
unhappy posting that the the release of this game would otherwise have
brought forth.  By the way, any idea when EQLive might be finished?

/sarcasm off

   Ok.  I think that when people plop down the $50 or whatever to buy a
game, they will expect something that is reasonably "finished".  If they
know anything about MMORPGs, and most buyers of EQII will, I imagine, they
should know new content will be added with time.  I'll even go further out
on a limb and say that they should be tolerant of light content.  But even
so, they will expect a game that is at least playable and relatively bug
free.

    If the game does not meet that expectation, they will bitch.  And you
know what?  I think they have every right to.  I plan on trying the game,
and I hope it does work when I do log in.  But if I can't play at all, and
have to wait for them to iron bugs out till I can, I might make a negative
post or too about it also.
