Let's pretent that you were talking about PoK for a sec... yep, it
still tracks. PoK was way out of whack. It shrunk the world, made the
hour-long trip from GFay to Paineel into a 2 minute run and cause
massive congestion. Of COURSE they were going to nerf it, right?

No, I refuse to play the "what value on which I might base my purchase
will SOE take away tomorrow" game. If they advertise a feature,
release that feature and people use that feature, then they should
change it only in the face of massive gameplay problems (which I agree
the tradeskill problem was, and they should have fixed THAT).

Retroactively changing the game so that people like me who got 100k
tribute by paying HARD EARNED PLAT for items that had a good ratio and
turning them in is just wrong. I thought this was what they wanted: to
get rid of the "junk" items like Weighty Polearm that were so common
that no other items even remotely in their league could retain value.
I thought I was doing what the system DEMANDED of us, but instead, my
point total will go negative next week... what I do then I haven't
decided, but I'm out a fair amount of plat and I just don't feel like
farming it back....
