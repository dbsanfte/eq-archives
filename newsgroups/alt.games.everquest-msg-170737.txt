Actually, I've found that the people who most flagrantly exhibit that kind
of behavior are people who do know how to play at higher level.  The most
chaotic group I ever was in was a group of people around level 10 in The
Warrens...every one of which had 50+ characters, who had played with each
other often, and were fully familiar with high level play.  They were just
too busy having fun with these alts to bother to play well. :-)
