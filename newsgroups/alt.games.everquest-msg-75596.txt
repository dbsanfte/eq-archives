It happens because some "kind"( Spoiling) people buff for free or will
if someone asks them to do so. Due to that people get used to playing
constantly with sow or clarity or whatever so when they don't have it
they miss it then they start asking for it. They have to be retrained
but the problem is that there are still enough people spoiling them
that their behavior is still reinforced. Begging happens for the same
reason. Its weird when both groups of people (buff and money beggars)
freak out when you just say "no".
