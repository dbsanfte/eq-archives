Actually the GD port has been there for a long time now. Be warned,
however, that both you and your customers will need a special tooth on
your person in order to be able to be ported there. You can pick it up
off the ground in the dragon ring in GD.  Respawns pretty quickly if
there's several of you going. Not far from Thurg, either. Fairly safe
area to port into. (Providing, of course, you're not on Giant faction.)
