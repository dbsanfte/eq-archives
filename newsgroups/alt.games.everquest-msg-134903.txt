Oh thanks,

After I read a bit more, thats what I thought it might mean.  I was thinking
that they had a system in place now to track spell durations.  It would be
kind of handy to know approximately when my mezz will break or when my tank
haste buffs are dropping.  Right now, I use a second computer that has a few
freeware timers on it when I need to watch that closely.
