Too hoity toity and uppety to even think of turning on AFK eh. Damn arrogant
druids ; )

I play on Xeg, got a 36 dru, and in all my time I have only ever once been
asked by a stranger for me to PL them. Get the occasional sow request, of
which I'm happy to oblige, but absolutely nothing like what Whittleberry
suggests, but then he should NOT have chosen the name Sowphorphree shoud he
; )

Cheers
