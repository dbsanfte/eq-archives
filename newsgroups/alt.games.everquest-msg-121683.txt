This is the correct answer.

Some of the throwing items since Luclin came live
DO have effects on them, as far as stat boosts.  If you
put one in the RANGE slot, you see the increases.

If you put it in AMMO (which it will fit in), you will NOT
see an increase.  Some items (TCoDN for one...I
love that almost as much as Jboots) will right-click
from ammo, but no stats will be boosted from there.
