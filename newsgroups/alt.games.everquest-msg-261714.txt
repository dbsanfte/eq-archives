So you want players to trade items, you just don't want them to trade items?
I see...

Its one of my weakest pieces of gear, yes. Although suprisingly not the
weakest.   Whats your point?    Or is that your way of saying 'Tough shit,
you should have tried harder to get an upgraded helm by now.'?     I've
already been trying to upgrade all my gear slots, helm included.

So basicly you think it won't change anything, other than being extra hoops
for me to jump through and a drain for cash I don't really have.

No thanks.

The twinks can afford to pay it.  Thats how they got all that twink gear in
the first place.   Its the players like myself who don't spend all thier
time farming and selling twink gear that would be hit hardest.
