Well, when you say "we", if that is inclusive of me, then no. If it
excludes me, and includes you, then yes. You *are* having a bit of
trouble with your reading comprehension.

>Those who "don't THINK" in Zach's post 

It wasn't Zach's post. It was a poorly attributed posting by Dan
Harmon; Verant Arse Kisser.

>are rather clearly Verant's CS employees.  

Well, it can't be that clear, otherwise you'd realise that he's
talking about people like Dan Day. 

Let's talk you through it, shall we?

>> >The conspiracy theorists are few and far between.  

Here, he's referring to people who see Verant/SOE as some dark
malevolent force out to screw over their customers.

>> >I know that Dan Day has little or no respect for Verant and/or their customer service personnel, 

Here (as per usual) DH is presumptious enough to state that he knows
how DD thinks. He reckons that DD is a Verant-knocker... because he
isn't a VAK, and of course there are no inbetweens with DH.

>> >and he's not alone. 

Here, DH makes reference to others who shamelessly have the nerve to
make so much as a single critical comment about Verant.

>> >Hell, personally I think most are probably nice in real life but they just don't THINK.

And finally, here DH sums up DD and everyone else who has little or no
respect for Verant.

Wasn't so hard was it? DH is a commited VAK. He's as likely to suggest
that Verant employees "just don't THINK" as you are of ever getting a
clue.

>It appears that you really are just another troll with an
>overlarge agro radius...

It appears that you've just contributed to my theory that those who
label me as a troll do so due to cognitive difficulties.
