You can change the color of your car, because you own it. You can't
repaint a rental car. You are effectively only "renting" EQ, and as a
player you have no control over the "color" that it comes in. You can
fill out a "comment card" (/feedback) in the hopes that the company
will change things. That is pretty much what the original poster was
doing (assuming that Sony/VI sees the post).
