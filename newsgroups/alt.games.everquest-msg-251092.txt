The playerbase is extremely annoying.  I put up with some of it but when
they start discussing Bush politics in shout I logged off and cancelled my
account.  No /ignore function at this time, and no word as to if they will
ever add it.  Other than that, the graphics are nice, the play seems
grindish.  Hard to find a group.  I only made it to L14.
