Sadly, its too late to get exp on the early portions; I'd have advised you to
start epic 15 levels ago!  Now you have days of fighting greens ahead of you
trying to spawn the rare nameds that drop what you need in LRathe and SolA.

With a decent guild (not an uber one by any means, a low 50s guild is quite
capable of this) you can complete your epic this week if you want.  Sadly, most
of that time will be spent killing greens.

If you'd worked on those parts earlier, while they were decent camps, you'd be
set to go now and could get epic in a day if you were a bit lucky.

Besides the farming greens, you'll also need to kill random mobs in SF till they
come out your ears, looking for four pearlescent shards.  This is where a good
guild can help, by setting up a bunch of exp groups spread out over the zone,
and making sure you have SOW and invis at a moments' notice so you can run to
loot the drops as they fall, you can cut the time on this little sink down to
something reasonable.

Or you can spend a week soloing them up for yourself if you'd rather.
