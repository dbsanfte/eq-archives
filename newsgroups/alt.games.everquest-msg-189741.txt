From the shadows, the mysterious "John Kievlan" <jodakim@attbi.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>SOE nerfed twinking.  Now if you equip your character with anything the game
>doesn't consider "realistic" for your level, you don't get any experience
>unless you swim to the middle of OOT, go to the bottom, bind yourself, sit

>you'll see a major change in your exp bar.
>
>Well, actually I'm not sure if you can even bind yourself underwater, or if
>you lose exp when you drown.  Doesn't matter.  You should try it anyway,
>then come back and post about it.

I remember a guildmate on Tholuxe doing this to make himself quit EQ.
