Google for a freeware program called runfirst.exe.  Put it in your
everquest directory.

Then make a batchfile to start up eq something like the following:

@echo off
cd "c:\Program Files\EverQuest"
c:
.\runfirst.exe everquest.exe

runfirst.exe will force processor affinity for the program it chains to
to the first core of the CPU.  The normal methods to set processor
affinity (through task manager) do not seem to work for EQ.
