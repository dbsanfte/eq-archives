Used to be able to scribe Tangling Weeds (also level one, but extremely fast
cast and short duration), now it's ranger only and druids can't scribe it
anymore (nor can we scribe the cleric version of Upheaval any more).  It
still blows asschunks though (I have it scribed)

Ensnare at level 29, 9 minute fixed duration.

Bonds of Tunare at 57, 1.8 minute AE snare (not sure if duration is fixed or
not)

Wrath of Nature, epic click effect has a snare component, but thankfully it
looks like they'll be removing the snare component on it next patch, it's
already changed on Test last I heard.  If you think that the snare on the
epic effect is good, you either a) don't play a druid or b) are a moron.
