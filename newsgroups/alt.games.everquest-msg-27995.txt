Ah, the ever eloquent and insightful *American* view of things, the new
world order trying to quantify and control western life *snorts*.
Pah, thou art nought but mewling kittens to the ancients!
Perhaps instead of spending your time telling others to get a life you would
be better advised to get on with living yours?
Do not seek to tell others how it is or should be, just do, and get on with
it.
If people are weak, it is because they choose to be weak, if they are gentle
it is because they choose to be gentle, all should realise there are no
victims, no coincidences and life is what you make of it, meekness is a
lie...
