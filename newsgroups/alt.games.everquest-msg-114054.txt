I think that they screwed up the drop rarity a bit.
Almost 200 kills to get the full set.
I think that that would take you over level 10 in terms of xp.
So you could spend your whole first 10 -12 levels doing this quest.

Probably what they should do is :

Rat drops :
Make ruined mossy pelt a bit less common (or keep it the same)
Make a mossy pelt much more common (Say twice as)
Make an undamaged pelt more common (say twice as)

This would reduce the number of rats required to about 50.

Large spider drops :
These seem about ok as there are quite alot of these spiders.
Plus you only need 4 drops from them.

Giant spider drops :
Make thorax less common since you only need one and it is for the tunic.
Make hairs Patella and femur more common since you need 2 of each.
I think that they stuffed up and reversed the rarity of the thorax and
the patella.

This would then reduce the number of spider kills a bit.
Should reduce the whole quest to a bit less than your first ten levels.
