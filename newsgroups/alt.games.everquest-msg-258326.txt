Well, depends what you mean by 'advantadge'.  Going below zero points 
won't help your insurance rates, nor is it even possible.  But I think you 
could probably go down to the courthouse and get a list of traffic schools 
and sign up for the classes just for a refresher course, if you really 
wanted to.  They might look at you a little funny when you don't have a 
certificate for them to sign, but I doubt they'd turn down your money. :)

Traffic Safety Taught With Humor! might even make a decent way to waste a 
Saturday.  If you're really bored. :)
