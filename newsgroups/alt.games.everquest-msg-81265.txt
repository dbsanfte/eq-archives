Much as I agree with you, I tried for some time to sell it this way
and got nothing but insulted. I finally gave in to the common cry of
"going rate for fp is 10pp per AC" and have had decent success with
it. I just use sound judgement. When I have downtime, I make pieces to
put in bank. I always try to sprinkle in a few extra attempts at
cloaks and gaunts and other more difficult pieces. Sure I've taken a
beating at the forge on occasion, but it's still working for me for
the most part.
