My 30 Berzerk won an augment in an LDoN yesterday, and put it on his 
highest level item, the one thing I imagine he'll be wearing longest 
into the future, a Metal Linked Crown picked up bargain hunting in the 
bazaar for 25pp.

The crown is reccomended level 50, but the current stats on it at level 
29 were much better than anything else available in the under 250pp 
range, and it will continue to get better as I level up; seemed like a 
great bargain.

Anyway, I put the augment on the crown (which has no Stamina on it 
normally), then looked at the stats, to find it reads +1(+2) for the 
stamina stat.  Yep, turns out the way they implement augments and 
reccomended levels, the stat on my augment (no reccomended level) was 
reduced for being on the item I'm under limit for!

Now I certainly recognize that one or two STA isn't going to make any 
real difference to my character, and I more or less put it on as a lark, 
since after all augments aren't sellable now that I'm not on FV.

But I'm curious about the process anyway; what exactly will it cost me 
now to remove that augment and put it on some other item?  How much 
would it cost me to just destroy the augment entirely?  I won't have to 
do the latter till I'm out of other places to put augments, which never 
  happened to my mage despite doing many levels of LDoN for exp... or if 
I find an even better helm and want to sell the MLC to try and recoup 
some of my massive 25pp investment

Grage, 30 Berzerk, Luclin
