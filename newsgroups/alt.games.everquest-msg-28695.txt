Far from true.  The only place this might apply is in the three original
continents.  Put enough polygons and sprites into any graphics engine and it
will bog down, which is exactly what Verant did with Kunark and Velious,
especially in zones with a massive amount of trees, and making the trees
move makes it even worse (Yes, swaying trees cause the game to slow down
regardless of what Verant says).  Try getting in a fight with 30+ people,
all effects on, and 1280x1024 resolution, framerates will be pretty bad
regardless of CPU and video card.  In Quake 3, if you've got a 1000 MHz+
processor and any GeForce 2, you will be getting playable framerates in
32-bit color with all effects on and at maximum levels all the time in
1600x1200.
