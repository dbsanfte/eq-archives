Weak. One who seeks to rape and sodomize is more sick than one who seeks 
to murder? Debatable. Worse than one who seeks to muder in the manner 
demonstrated here? Not even close. For someone who so values human life, 
you sure don't seem to look too unfavorably on those who would take it.

I'd be very surprised if you were able to find even one person who would 
honestly prefer that type of death to rape or sodomy.

Btw, the americans were reportedly doing it to intimidate and exhaust the 
prisoners to soften them up for interrogation, though some did seem to 
take some kind of sick pleasure in it. I don't approve of it for any 
reason, but it certainly wasn't "for shits and giggles". We can continue 
to discuss this if you like, but let's keep it factual.

Sawing off a screaming man's head is *far* worse than humiliation, rape, 
or sodomy.
