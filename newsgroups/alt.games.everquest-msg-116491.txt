This feature is called TargetGroupBuff. You can activate it by typing /tgb
on. once activated, anytime you cast a group buff it will affect the group
of the *target* instead of your own group. Interestingly... it works for you
too, so you can buff 7 people at once instead of 6 as long as you aren't in
the group.

Level limits and range still apply.

Also, FYI there is another feature that works well with this on raids. /RT
which I assume stands for "reply target". When someone sends you a /tell you
can type /RT and this will target whoever sent you the tell.. assuming they
are in the same zone as you and in range. So on a raid, someone needing a
buff is directed that "Mullo is handling circle buffs" they send me a sell,
I type /rt and it targets them, and I cast the group buff which buffs their
entire party.
