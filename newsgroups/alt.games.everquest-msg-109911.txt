While we're on the subject, there's a level 60 halfling druid in my
guild. She can get in on any raid easily. She is known for being
level-headed and would probably be put immediately in charge of one of
the main groups. She's known for being generous when it comes to
helping others. Not only does she not ask for money for ports, she
does everything she can to prevent people from slipping her a tip.
(Trade set to only with group, disband as soon as she lands, etc)

Just one halfling druid that totally blows the stereotype out of the
water. Then again, most of the halfing dr00ds I've met have been male
characters.
