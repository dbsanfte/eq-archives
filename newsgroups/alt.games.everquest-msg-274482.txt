They do, they're just very different from their real life counterparts. In 
real life you have considerably more "or else" backing up your authority but 
even in gaming guilds there still is some. A guild leader can make clear 
that there are certain types of behaviors that won't be tolerated and there 
will be some members who disagree with the prohibition and would choose to 
do otherwise but forgo doing so because of their desire to remain in the 
guild.

If you think that raid loot distribution is always done by consensus, then 
you haven't seen some of the loot distribution soap operas that I have lol! 
My time flagged guild from EQ survived every challenge surrounding 
unhappiness over command decisions of the loot council. I doubt that any of 
the unhappy would call the decisions "consensus", even if they abided by 
them. ;-)

Yes, but that's always the case, whether in gaming or real life. Machiavelli 
made the point 500 years ago on the topic of ruling conquered peoples and 
the cascading fall of communist governments in the modern world provides a 
more current example. All regimes, organizations, countries, and gaming 
guilds exist at the pleasure of the participants. The cost to break away 
from some is higher, but the option is always there and the direction taken 
can always be characterized as a choice. It might be a Hobson's choice, but 
it's a choice. Even a soldier can decide to go AWOL rather than fight what 
he considers an immoral war. To argue from this that all military command 
decisions are "consensus" because all soldiers who comply are are agreeing 
"tacitly" I think just strips away all meaning from the words. And anyway it 
doesn't really diminish in my mind the utility of characterizing decisions 
into these three broad categories for the purpose of deciding how best to 
approach a particular one.
