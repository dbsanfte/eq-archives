 TLC is the main reason I wont be buying Luclin. So that blows that
theory. It's not a matter of whether I would even use any of those items
that may come from "trivial" encounters. I simply have a problem with
Verant dictating how I can play the game. If TLC has any effect it's
probably the opposite.

 As far as any other online games go I'm not really interested. I have
put a lot of time into EQ. I have had fun but there comes a point when
one has to move on. I don't see myself jumping to something else that
can consume most of my freetime.
