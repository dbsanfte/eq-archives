I've heard they have faction now.  I think this is a good thing.  Some may
be mad about it but the mobs there hit HARD and when my group needed to run
to guards the wandering one was much closer than the others. Unfortunately
everytime I depended on him being there, he'd be gone because somebody had
come thru killing all the guards.
