Actually, you're getting the wrong impression. Wizards and rogues are
neck and neck for the best damage dealers in the end game. Rogues tend
to have better sustainable damage per minute, but wizards can blow
them out of the water in terms of damage per second short to medium
term.

When putting together higher-end raids (when I used to do such
things,) the first question was: do we have enough clerics, then do we
have enough rogues and wizards, then do we have enough defensive
tanks. Of course, this may have been because my guild had twelve level
60 warriors and only five 58+ rogues and wizards at the time out of
about 80 members.

In XP groups, the most common line-up is tank, cleric, chanter or
bard, wizard or druid, +2. Wizards are needed for evac and, even when
evac is already found, can still drop into the +2 slots for their
excellent damage dealing.
