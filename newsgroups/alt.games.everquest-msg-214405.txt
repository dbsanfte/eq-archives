No. EQ has 12ish different paths (classes) to take. But each one is a 
dead straight line.

Alas true. (And that was a real disappointment with AC), but within 
those 3 classes their was variation, and it was player determined where 
the skillups/points went. Your character at any point was a reflection 
of your actions and your choices. In EQ the only decision you really 
make about your characters skills is made when you selected a class at 
the beginning.

EQs tradeskill system is a model of tedium. Simply amazing is a gross 
overstatement.  Hundreds of recipes but only a handful of items worth 
making, and those only at the high skill levels. The only way to skill 
up is to tediously make useless items at a loss, with endless 
expensive/rare component consuming failures. At least with AC you could 
'hunt' your tradeskills up.

But I would agree with "neither tradeskill system is 'great'"
