It's not so bad.  It's actually from the jam one of the band members Aunt
Pearl used to make.  There are a ton of other possible explanations I've
seen over time, but actually living in Seattle and having followed (and
actually having hung out with some of the band members that this applies
to...) the Seattle band scene for the last 25 years - I think the jam notion
is much more likely. ;)
