Lore spells?

Do you mean the Ancient spells I've read about are LORE when they drop?
Might just be an anti-pharming measure.

Unless you mean that ALL spell scrolls are now LORE (and I just missed the
patch message), so that low level chars don't accidentally buy duplicate
spells when they hit level 4/5, 8/9, 12/15... and aren't sure what spells
they already bought (done that a few times over the years myself, playing an
unfamiliar caster and having to swap between 3 diff vendors, some of whom
carry some, but not all of a casters new line-up)
