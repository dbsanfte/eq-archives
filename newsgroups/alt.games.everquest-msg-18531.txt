Well, the spelling for the most part is correct.  And grammatically
speaking, you did a good job of it.  <G>  This in itself is better than 60%
of the fanfic on the web.  But you need to work on your descriptive
skills -- I must say, I tried to wade through the purple prose, but like the
unbearable over-powering force of a necromancer's Engulfing Shadow, my
progress was hindered by the overly lurid discriptions of a Norrath about
which I'm already familiar.  When I got to the part where you said, "All
other revered it so much that it was not even spoken of," I stopped dead.

If necromancy is such a vile and dispicable form of magic (which it isn't,
its just another form of power to its practioners:  but hey, its your story,
but just realize that other people have different views of Norrath than you
do), why then do they revere it?

So, I didn't have anything to say, because I didn't even get to the first
chapter -- but since you asked, I'm telling you why I stopped.  I didn't
need you telling me about the world I've been living in for over 40+ levels.
Just get on with the story and let the info-dumping happen later, you need
to hook your readers from the first paragraph, not the 10th.  Also, you had
a dangling preposition in the above sentence.
