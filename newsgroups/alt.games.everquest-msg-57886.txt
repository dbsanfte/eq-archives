Thank you,

Now please explain what "Eggs easy", "Eggs over easy" is

Perhaps a book can be compiled, "How to understand Americanisms"

English is the common language between us but I have some difficulties with
some phrases and I know a lot of my friends stateside are constantly saying
"Huh? What he say?"

Example "Anyone near Dreads for Rez, Gorenaire just twatted me"
"whats twatted?"
