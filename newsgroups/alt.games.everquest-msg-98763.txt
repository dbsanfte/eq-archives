I recently dinged 16 with my mage and headed over to the Oasis.  Fine 
when I was grouped, but logged on yesterday and had only one or two 
other folks in the zone with me.  Is there a good zone near the Oasis 
for mages to solo, or good strategy for the areas around there?  He's 
lived most of his life in and around Gfay, Steamfont and those areas 
until now.

Thanks!
