Hi.  I have created a dwarven rogue to have some fun with.  My main is a
level 50 cleric...

Anyway I've managed to PL my Rogue up to 8th level with the help of some
high level druid buffs and a donated Slime Coated Harpoon.

My rogue is pretty much naked except for the crappy armor I have looted from
goblins and orcs.

What gear (armor and jewelery) should I look for?  I want something good,
but not overly expensive.  I havent much money on my rogue OR my cleric for
that matter.

What stats are most important?  STR?  DEX? AGI? Dex for procing weapons at
higher levels right?

MR seems to be quite important..  At least I've noticed it to be valuable to
my cleric...  Even though his MR is VERY low.

Currently my rogue is using a bow and arrows for pulling...  Should I use
something else?

Any advice?  I've never really played a melee type... I've alwats been a
caster type.
