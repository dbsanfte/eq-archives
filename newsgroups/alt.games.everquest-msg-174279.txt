Starting at L29 my Druid (untwinked, using Chipped Bone Bracelet and
Serpentine Bracer for focus items) could stack:

Immolate (24/tick over 12 ticks for 80 mana),
Creeping Crud (21/tick over 12 ticks for 67 mana),
Stinging Swarm (14/tick over 9 ticks for 44 mana), and
Flame Lick (3/tick over 8 ticks for 7 mana).

This gives 62 hp damage per tick while I am (mostly) medding!  If I
were to partner with another Druid we could kill high blue to yellow
con mobs approximately one per minute with little or no down time and
it would not be difficult to coordinate (not hard to keep track of
two "ripening on the vine", so to speak).  And we could do it without
KEI.  And this continues to scale as you add DoT casters (one nice
thing about Druid for this is that their roots break less often and
their DoTs have no DD component to break the root when reapplied).

*shrug*  Not much point in grouping if you aren't going to work as a
team.

Been there, done that, don't stay in dysfunctional groups anymore.

If it's actually melee dominated (as opposed to appearing to be melee
dominated) then you are either playing with seriously twinked melees
(common) or unimaginative players (even more common), or both.  Even
in these unimaginative bash and heal groups you are generally limited
by mana supply, hardly a melee dominated situation.  And the difference
between melees without caster augmentation and melees with is like
night and day.  At L14 a Shaman already has a 30% slow, plus root, SoW,
and serviceable heals and DoTs.  At L16 (iirc) an Enchanter has his
first haste and a 48-second mez.  Clerics get very useful ac/hp buffs
to go with the best heals in the game (and can do cc with root).
Druids have SoW for the puller, DS for the MT, usable heals, a usable
ac/hp buff, stackable DoTs, Harmony, and the best Roots in the game
outside of AA.  And, well, the list goes on and on.  Skilled casters
are worth a ton to any group.  The game looks to me to be very much
caster dominated (in terms of numbers and power) at the low- to mid-
levels (in the 40s you are smack in the middle of what is now mid-
level).
