I don't mind a 45 minute timer on the ports.  What I do mind is not
knowing where in that 45 minutes you are.  They need some sort
of "train schedule" at the Luclin 'porter to let you know that you
have 15 minutes to farm poison components in S. Ro as opposed
to just sitting on your ass waiting for something to happen.

Same thing with boats.  It's all nice and good for some idiot to
shout "The Maiden's Voyage is now ready for boarding," but
when it takes 20 minutes to get the shuttles going after that,
there's a problem.

Give me an NPC with a clock in her head at the docks/on the
wizzie platform.

"Hail, Madam Portowski"
"Hail, traveller...won't be too much [longer] for the Teleporters
to come into alignment again."
"How much longer?"
"You've got 22 minutes by my calculations, friend...better make
sure your goods are in order!"

Would that be so hard?
