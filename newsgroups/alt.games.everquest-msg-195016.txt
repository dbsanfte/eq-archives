You can pay the guide pirates $14.95 or listen to me. As an aside, if
I was selling this info to you, I would make it sound like the
greatest thing since sliced bread.

It's implementation is more legendary than it is practical. It is slow
and isn't worth it IMHO. For a high level guy, you make a lot more
farming.

Make gator pickles, and sell them to the vendor, you SLOWLY make plat.
It USED to be fish rolls, but that is nerfed. If you can buy shark
meat, that also makes a vendor profit. Gator meat is available in
Shadowhaven in unlimited quantities, but I can't tell you where the
gator farm is.

Still, the Seafury Cyclops, HG and IG are the way to go. I have never
made serious money on tradeskills to vendors.

A suggestion is also to do Greater Lightstones. Before you laugh, a
stone is 10pp if you turn it into a gypsy in Oasis or the DE Smith in
South Ro, and I can get a pack full in an hour, thats 100pp an hour.
The LS are okay for 4-5pp turned into the gypsy or Smith. They give
you a book and you sell the book back to the vendor.

The Acrylia market seems pretty saturated and the dye market is hardly
worth it. Maybe try POTC trade items?
