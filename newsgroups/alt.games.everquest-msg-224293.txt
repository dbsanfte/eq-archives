Well, one would hope that by the time the mob enrages the MA has good 
agro.  If the MA is a knight class, then cast a few cheap high agro 
spells.  A warrior will have to taunt and hope, or use some right clicky 
item, or, use a slow 2 hander, and take the hits.  Honestly, I don't see 
a problem with enraged mobs turning away from the MA generally, 
regardless of class.  The MA does stop attacking, and, does what he can 
to generate additional agro, while the others either kill it so fast it 
doesn't matter, or try not to get agro, many DPS types have a way to dump 
unwanted agro.
