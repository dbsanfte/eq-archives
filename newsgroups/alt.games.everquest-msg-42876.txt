On a note Related to the original post of giving blood, according to a
friends father who works for red cross, They have more than enough
people donating blood right now, but in a month when they will need
more, they are afraid that they won't be able to get what they need
because people won't be eligible yet.  If you still want to donate blood
you might wait a few weeks, it should be easier to get through to get an
appointment then too.
