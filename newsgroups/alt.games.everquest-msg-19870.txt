There's no "getting around it".
It's not an AoE mez, it's a stun--12 second stun with a 900hp DD
attached to it.  Annoying, but the only way to "get around it" is to
just jack up your MR and resist it.

Our main problem with PD isn't the stun, it's not even her stupidly
chain casting complete heal (record is letting her get off 5 CH and
chasing her around VP), it's her gating.

Gating dragons can absolutely blow me.

Dragons usually can get one charm off before they are getting the beat
down.  I think I've only had one person charmed at a time from various
dragons we've killed.
