I remember reading somewhere that a recent patch reduced the effectiveness
of cha on charm-type spells. This seems to bring it in line with the
low-influence the other stats have on character performance. I have always
been disappointed with how little the stat boosts I get from equipment
affect my play.
In my opinion, stats should play a much bigger part in the game, they add
much more depth to creating your character, and also make you think a bit
more about buying equipment.

Has Verant ever explained the reason for reducing the role stats play in the
game?
Are they moving towards more generic characters so everyone in the same
class/race starts the same?

Facts, suggestions and speculations are all welcome.
