Lowering your standards helps too. Look in the mirror and think, "if I
were the hot females I want to date, would I looke at ME twice?" If
not, then lower your target. Statistics which I am pulling out of my
ass as I write this, sort of, say that the most successful long
lasting couplings/marriages are between people who are on the same
level of attractiveness.

One large problem for guys is that often a "hotter" guy settles which
gives many females an inflated perception of their looks. This, in
tur, makes those guys equal to them lose out. They then have to settle
for less attractive females, taking them from Jaybob the toothless.
Its kind of a vicious circle.

Something I learned is that in order to meet the right person you have
to get out there and you have to be social. It also helps to be
totally honest. You don't want to "trick" a female since they will
eventually find out what you really are. You should instead celebrate
as you weed out the ones who don't go for you, it means your search is
getting narrowed.

You can also be glad that as you age, so do any of them who are left.
Eventually they realize that the guy in the white Lexus is not going
to show up, they are now 37 like you are and that kid they got knocked
up with is 18 and going off to college, if even semi stable you start
to look like a good catch. The bonus is its very unlikely they want
more kids and you probably would not at that age either (its not a
good idea, my parents were 38 when they had me and its too big a gap,
they are also both now deceased though I am only 36, as are my
grandparents.)

Why do so many people spell it "looser?" Its "loser."  "Looser" would
be English for something not as tight, though I'm pretty sure its
improper. What you'd really say would be, "Shelly is more loose than
Jane", rather than "looser."
