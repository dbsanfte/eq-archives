Forager Froglok drops them in Trak's Teeth, my 52 druid with a 53
Necro pulling him again after each kill (he respawns after death) we
were averaging two spells an hour. None of the spells were for our
classes (Of course). Soloing however means you'll not be as lucky on
the spell drop, but I've had more dropped spells more often when
grouped in Traks on Forager, then they were dropping when I grouped in
Skyfire.
