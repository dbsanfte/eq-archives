Now what gets me is that Dick is, what, level 12, I think he said?  Compare 
that to EQ Live... the exp loss at death in the low teens there is virtually 
negligable too.  10 minutes of fighting, and you're right back to where you 
were.  Hmmm... isn't that what you said about EQII?  Doesn't that actually 
make sense in the overall context of the game?
(Hell, in EQL, there is 0 penalty below 10 any more- talk about your "no 
fear of dying").  I'm sure that in higher levels this will be adjusted so 
that there is more of a reason not to die...
What about EQL mobs and encounters?  There's nothing much out of the 
ordinary there... most people are probably in PC at that point, or in the 
older days in Crush and Blackburrow.  The mobs there are nothing fancy.  A 
group of any type of character could beat most mobs simply by hitting 
"auto-attack" and waiting.  Hell, a cleric or wizzy could "tank" there in a 
pinch as long as you weren't derailing a train.
Finding undercons?  Easy.  Hit it.  If it's light blue and kicks your ass, 
you die and it's an undercon, and you stay away for a few levels.  The EQII 
arrows just save you that "test" death.
Now compare that to the higher levels... hardly even the same game, right?
Of course it's going to start out slow, look how low you are still...  At 
this point in the game, any number of tactics will work for an encounter, 
but I'd wager that as we all progress, tactics will have to be refined in 
order to succeed.
It's hard to talk about how much a game sucks when you're so little of the 
way through it.  Sure it has it's problems, but they're working on it, and 
from where I sit, most aspects of it are getting better with each patch.
It pretty much boils down to: if you don't like it, don't play.
Personally, I have a 13 druid and a 9 fighter, and I'm having a ball... 
There are certainly things that don't work quite right, or could be better 
(which I make known on the beta board), but the game hasn't even been 
released yet, so deal.

Oh, and just so you know- around here, being a programmer?  Not that big a 
deal.  I'm a programmer too... we have tons.  You can't sneeze in here 
without hitting one...  Unless you're a programmer on EQII, you're no more 
an expert on what they are doing or what they should be doing or what they 
mean by BETA than anyone else...
