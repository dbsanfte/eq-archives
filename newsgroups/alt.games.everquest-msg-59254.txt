I have heard the Shaman called King of the Buffs which may be true but it 
does all get confusing.

I have reached level 14 with my Barbarian Shaman grouping with one or two 
which is`nt a problem but I have read on different sites about the various 
roles of the shaman in a group and it seems to me that can get confusing.

My question is this, I do`nt think I have the mana to buff everyone in a 
large group with everything never mind also dot and heal so what buffs 
should I concentrate on giving whom!?  Like Strength, Agility for a fighter
and maybe Dexterity for a caster and so on.........

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
