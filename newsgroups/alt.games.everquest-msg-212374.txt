I keep hearing about "the Trials."  Where do they take place? I know you
need a group of high levels to expect to defeat them, but what should you
expect? What are you fighting? How do you schedule to take the trials? What
do you get if you defeat the trial?  A flag? Literally?

 I am in a big guild that does them routinely, but I've never been and don;t
want to look like a total goob by asking too many questions.  So, I'll ask
them here!  :-)
