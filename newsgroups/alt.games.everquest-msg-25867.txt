    So players cannot pursue some quests that may be made for them if VI
didn't think through the quest enough, like the shaman epic. Wonderful.

    This is off the Development boards, the response part is from Absor.

"After thinking about the "Warrens Loot Code / No No Drop" idea I've decided
that I'd rather the whole thing were left alone. It's an interesting idea,
but:

1. You'll spend months having to adjust the various quests and
"who-knows-what" that adding this code would break.

2. No matter what you do, without a system to remove items from the economy
it will eventually become saturated.

3. I don't know your opinions, but frankly this game's hard. Darn hard.
Harder than many
"roleplayers" prefer as it is. By making equipment harder to acquire the
game itself gets harder. If you really want to cater to roleplayers then
your difficulty level is probably high enough as-is."

    Absor's responses, following numbers:

1. Well, more like months finding which ones are broken and fixing them. A
quest that is 'broken' by this code will probably be pretty rare. A lot of
the quests that will become unavailable for higher level characters will not
be broken just because they can't be accessed by those characters. There
will be a few quests that are intended for those higher level characters
that will certainly need to be found and altered. *And a few broken quests
will not ruin the server at all.*

    Emphasis on last line added by me.

    Looks like all the tireless bugging them to fix broken quests has been
pointless, if this is the prevailing attitude. Damnit, Absor, it's sorta
tough to suspend belief and interact with NPCs if what they tell you is
broken! If that dwarf shouts "Cannot open file guards.txt", if the gnome
mages believe they're Fire Peak goblins, if the quest giver says there will
be a quest, and there isn't - these things ANNOY people, more than not
having the most up-to-date graphics.

2. Sure. But the Warrens loot code is not a fix for any sort of economy
issues. It is designed to help keep content available for those of the
'appropriate' level for that content.

    Only issue is, you have NO idea who wants what content. That 3 INT cloak
I got last night in the Warrens - who was that aimed at, again? Who is the
Guano Harvester for, exactly? The Glowing Black Stone is for WHAT level of
character? And as for keeping folks out, well, here's how I got my cloak: a
high level paladin pulled the Prince to zone and beat it up a lot. Since I'm
a necromancer, my lifetaps land on mobs five levels higher than me without
any problems. Pally zoned, I finished the Prince with ease (despite it being
five levels above me), pally couldn't use the cloak and gave it to me. It
stops NOTHING - it just makes the person bring along the second account
mule.

3. Actually, my opinion is that the game is a little too easy. And, well,
how hard the game is isn't really related to whether or not it's a
roleplaying game. I've played relatively easy games and some extremely hard
ones (Call of Cthulu run by a truly evil GM). The 'hardness' of the game
doesn't really determine whether or not it is a roleplaying game. The
difficulties that we intend to add, like the language barriers (in a
seemingly contrary statement), are intended to encourage people to roleplay.
The thought here is that, well, the roleplayer won't really be worried that
it takes a little longer to reach level X (and, at the same time, wouldn't
be all that worried if it took a little less time either).

    More like the HOPE is roleplayers won't care if they level up fast or
not, as VI is petrified that people will hit 60 and leave the game due to
lack of content.
