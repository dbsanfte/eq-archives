< snip hostility from left field >

It is odd that you demand citation of sources for the claims of others, yet 
offer no such sources or supporting facts for your own.

I have no idea where the heapin' helpin' of hostility came from, but I'll 
just chime in with my 2cp worth. Given what kaev said and what you said, 
kaev's response was both civil and citing of non-confrontational 
viewpoints, the validity of which notwithstanding. Your response was both 
rude and unnecessarily obstinate and smacking of some sort of personal 
attack.

Who do you think will be taken more seriously and come off as more 
persuasive?
