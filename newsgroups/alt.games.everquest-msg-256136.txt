No wizards / mages? Are you taking into account spell damage, or are your
wizards and mages slacking?  Is this just the boss mob or overall dps.

Monks do far more dps than rangers given equal weapons, oh wait, we *might*
outdamage you once an hour...

Tanking? Procs are good enough for aggro these days (wa5 = anyone can be a
decent tank), though beastlords are better than both (which I also feel is
wrong).  Yes we can get snap aggro, most of the time people dont want us
to.....

Talking about rangers tanking in a raid enviroment is strange, do you ever
have rangers tanking on your raids (where the content isnt already gimp to
you).  Mention WS and I shoot you :P

"Add to that the utility, nukes,
> heals, buffs, root, snare, GOOD range damage "

Nukes = resisted by most raid mobs and usually lower dps.
Heals = hahahaha
Root = how unique
Snare = how unique
Good range damage, yep, useful for 2% (number pulled out of ass) of fights?
Harmony = how unique and resisteable (unlike FD and monk lull), has a level
cap of 65 and only usable outdoors.
Buffs = SoP and CotR, SoT to the odd one or two people.

When a TANK class outdamages a DPS class, something is wrong, especially
when that TANK, has the same or better utility than the DPS class.
