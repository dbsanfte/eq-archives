Now might be a good time to learn the joys of grouping. Solo XP sucks
at 54. It took me about 8 hours to get a yellow soloing with my necro
at that level. A well-balanced group can bring that down to 5 hours or
so.

54 is a bish. 55 is a little bit better. But, 56 feels just as slow.
And, I've heard people in 59 laugh at people who bitch about 54.
