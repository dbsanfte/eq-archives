  A couple other semi-important functions are necessarily performed client side,
namely how you "see the world".  Lighting, type of vision (infra, ultra, normal)
as well as how the world is rendered (so with the right hacks you could probably
see through walls and the like).  This is probably more difficult for the server
to detect than run speed hacks, because it seems to me that there could be some
sort of code put in place (serverside) to check your character's actual movement
vs. how fast your character should be able to move... though it might be tricky
to implement and perhaps resource intensive on Verant's side to monitor.  I've
had the DirectX timer screw up at times (usually after a patch) so animations
and my movement are faster than normal, so I doubt it's that difficult of a
hack.

  I really wish Verant would allow us to alt-tab out of EQ.  It's a perfect
example of typical Verant unyielding stubbornness.  It's a useless limitation
that serves chiefly to frustrate and annoy their customers.  I'd estimate that
at least 9 out of 10 people I've discussed the subject with say they think the
limitation should be lifted.  Even a few techs and GMs I've talked to say they
wish people could alt-tab out of the game.

  Ah well, it's just one of those things that steadily whiddles away my patience
with Verant. :)
