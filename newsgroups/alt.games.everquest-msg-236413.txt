Yeah they are a good one really. As you say its only 3 less than the
second maxxed wisdoms (dwarf/erud and dark elf, High elf is the first
highest of course) Sneak as a racial ability is great for clerics, for
the ability to have indifferent faction with an npc for a
quest/selling.

Yeah, plus as part of the snare necklace quest series a dark elf
cleric can do the quest for the one use halfling form mask any time
they are back around Nek. forest and feel like killing master whoopall
(Place holder quester dunden)  That mask was the old school way to
solve faction problems for them, before form change potions (its still
cheaper so mine still used it after that)
