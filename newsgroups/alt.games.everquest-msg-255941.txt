    Thanks for naming two.

    Basically, anywhere there the mobs hit for 900's or less would be
smack-downable, worse than that would be a challenge. As an uberguilder you
can list those zones for yourself better than I can.

    Yeah I've seen one pickup raid for progression in my time, and it was
headed for Grummus with 70 people. I turned it down because my guild was
doing Grummus (had wiped with 30). They wiped. We won with 40 a few days
later.

    So I'm one of the guys who sits back and scoffs about open raids while
they *don't* succeed, and the people don't get flags, or something.

Cheers,
James
