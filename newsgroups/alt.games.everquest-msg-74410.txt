I know that some people with "share" (heaven forbid) their accounts.
One of my guildmates... She is one of 3 sisters.. .each has their own
account.... But when Luclin came out... they started a Beaslord Cat on
one account and they have been playing that account 24x7 since
release.  (its level 49 now).
when one goes to bed.. another takes over.. someone has to go
somewhere.. another takes over...

I pesonaly dont want anyone playing my characters... I have made them
what they are.
