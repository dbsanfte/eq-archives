/ooc A friend of mine suggested I post about our Morel Thule guild
war. Of course we are a mostly Tierdal and a mostly Barbarian RP
guild.

I am Srie, a "business woman", and am well regarded in my circles
around Freeport and Neriak. This information was rejected for
publication in the "The Antonican Times". I guess they don't know the
score around here.

Tuath na Sgiath has declared war on the War Criminals of Morell Thule.
This shameless act of agression by barbarians may be laughable, but
the War Criminals will defend our interests and those of our friends.

They claim we have attacked guards in Halas and terrorized thier
friends the pale elves. They attack first in thier presence, and why
should we not enjoy other lands as we do our own?

It begs the question, why are those guards out unsupported where they
can be attacked? The poor Bandl McMarrin, how he went down over and
over again, with no one but the weak to mourn him. We couldn't
understand what passes for speech from those apes, who can, even
though I am sure it was pathetic. It almost made me cry as we looted
his corpse.

In the West Commons, they attacked us and we repelled them with heavy
losses on both sides. They could be smug in thier surprise attack
until we took the fight to the gates of Halas. In Halas we kept them
bottled up inside for days. We finally left after the smell was too
much. We tried to root one under the water but he wriggled like a
little fish and swam off.

Overall I look forward to testing a new line of blade lubricants on
them. I like it when they think I am thier mother as thier draw thier
dying breath. It's a shame I can't use thier loot. It all smells like
they do.

We are coming for you Tuath na Sgiath. We hunted you like mice in
Halas, and we will find you wherever you are.
