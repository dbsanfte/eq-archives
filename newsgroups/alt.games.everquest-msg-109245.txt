<step on soap-box>

I still have to agree in the end with the idea that this is just a game...
and that going out in RT and buying loot for your characters is cheating.
Besides all the arguments of having more money than intelligence (of which
I'm still thinking that it's nuts to be blowing that kind of cash for
equipment in EQ), I think that people that go out and buy stuff without
actually earning it cheapens the game for the rest of us. Hey, if you go out
and earn cool items and want to use them, even for a twink, go for it. You
earned them, so you have the right to use them as you see fit (not that I
like twinks, but that is a whole other argument). But I think that the point
of playing any game is getting a sense of accomplishment that you were able
to beat the bad guy, get some cool stuff, etc. If you want to cheat, then go
play a game with cheat codes so you can get the best stuff without any
effort. But then, what is the point of playing? Yes I know, sometimes it's
just cool to try the cool stuff without earning it... but in games such as
EQ, that just makes the people who spend the time to go out and get the top
of the line gear feel that their efforts are cheapened by some guy who just
bought his off someone.

We all could go on for weeks debating what is cheating and what isn't in EQ.
Is the guy giving away free uber-loot and pp at the local bank to everyone
because he is quitting EQ cheating? Is the senior guild members giving cool
stuff to juniors to give them an advantage over non-guild members cheating?
Is twinking your characters cheating? Probably not... since this is all
happening inside the game environment... and VI doesn't seem to get too bent
out of shape over these kind of activities (and it's cool as a newer
character to have some your senior take you under his wing). VI has and can
deal will some twinking issues, and probably will again in the future. But
going out in real time and spending big bucks to buy your character some
uber-loot is cheating and illegal (I'm sure VI would have some copy write
issues over it). Whether you have the money and can afford it is besides the
point. The game has changed from the most skilled or determined players
being the most successful (for the most part) to the ones willing to spend
the most money being the most successful. And that affects how everyone else
plays.

If you want to go down to the local pub to spend your cash on a few dozen
pints of beer in order to piss that much harder, hey go for it. However, if
your actions affects us... i.e., after you piss your beer away, I have to
clean you up off the street because, in your drunken stupor you thought you
could beat the snot of some guy because he is still pissing harder than you
(or other form of drunken stupidity)... then I think we all have the right
to say bullshit and form laws which make this behaviour unacceptable (i.e, a
pleasant stay in the local drunk tank for the evening). I think one of those
laws for EQ that most people who play have agreed to is that going out and
spending RT cash on EQ items is not acceptable, and should not be allowed.

But as Dennis Miller say, that's just my opinion, and I could be wrong. Or
something like that.
