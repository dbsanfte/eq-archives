/boggle

and how many jedi knights do you see out there?

We druids have all of *4* epic level encounters (5 if you count CoM reavers,
but you can buy those off other people)
Ulump Puljuk
Faydedar
VSR
Seahorse

Brownie, Seafury, EK corruptor are one-groupable.

Mammoth, HG, Gobbie, gorilla and barracuda are soloable.

We have *THE* easiest epic, bar shaman in some ways.  (shaman can actually
follow through their quest without resorting to spoiler sites every step of
the way.)

Warriors get to go to *3* planes, Chardok, kill 2 dragons, and spend a
buttload of cash on the 2 rebreathers, keg of ale, and gems for the
unjeweled hilt.

Not to mention that the only things we share with anyone other than another
druid is the rangers for VSR.
