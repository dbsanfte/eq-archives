In a discussion of LDoN Richard Pfister answered the following:

GS: Are there other EverQuest expansions in the works? Will you continue to 
produce full retail expansion packs for the original game after EverQuest 
II's release? 

RH: Absolutely. If anything, customer demand for new EverQuest expansions 
keeps rising. We are now up to two a year. You can count on another 
expansion in spring 2004. We have others planned, but marketing gets 
unhappy if we talk about things too far out. 


Obviously the Spring '04 is GoD, and they had others planned as far
back as August of last year.  As long as EQ brings in the kind of dollars
it's doing now, they will continue to develop for it.  Simply good
business.
