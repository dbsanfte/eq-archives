    Am I the only one that sees this every time the game fires up?  Along with
the message that gameplay might change during play?  Not trying to be sarcastic
here.  If I am having a persistent, realistic hallucination I think it would be
good to know.

   Are you saying this because of the Teen rating?  If so, I'd have to
disagree.  The rating is a guideline, not a legal mandate.  I believe the EULA
states that one must be an adult, or an adult must give the account to a minor
and take full responsibility for the fallout, regardless of the age of the
minor.  From this understanding, which I freely admit might be all wrong, SOE
could care less if 3 year olds play the game, as long as they don't get sued.

 The EQ Devs also try to make the game play-safe

   Eh.  For the most part, yes.  It is true that you're not given the
opportunity to kill any helpless waifs in the streets of Qeynos.  And the
youngins you can kill, such as the fungus sporling in the Innouthule Swamp,
generally aren't humanoid, to the best of my memory.  But still, if a six year
old decides he/she wants to be a troll (and plenty of six year old's I've met
would make that choice) they will see dismembered dwarves strung up about the
place.  Then there's the The Lil Honeybugger quest.  Dark elf rapes halfling,
and then gets a newbie rogue to kill the pregnant halfling to prevent the birth
of his child.  Details and some discussion about it are here
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=166# .  True, Pazin never
says the word "rape" but how else would he be able to knock up a halfling? 
Either through force or trickery, he raped her.  And now wants her dead.  Also,
if you read some of the game lore on how the dark elves were created (by
torturing a high elf King and Queen for 100 years), you can see how this might
be a bit disturbing for a 7 year old.  To be honest, though, I don't know that
that lore can actually be found in game or not.
