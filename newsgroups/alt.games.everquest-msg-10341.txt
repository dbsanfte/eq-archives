Actually, the subject was pulling, and a smart ranger/druid puller will
not just snare, An SK pulling with Darkness has the same advantage as
Darkness is Snare/DoT.  Flame lick(DoT/Debuff) will out-taunt oh, 2 or 3
DDs.  and once I've got the MOB snared, Flame lick, and bow kite back to
the group, which shouldn't be too terribly far away.  Adds suck.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
