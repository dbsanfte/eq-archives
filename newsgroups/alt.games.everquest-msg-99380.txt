I get something similar only it happens after I have been on for a
couple hours.  Then game gets choppy and I have to log or I get
kicked.  I normally have to do a restart the log back in to get
things right again for the rest of my game time if I get enough time
it is worth it for me to log back in anyway.  No other game or
program does it just EQ  =(.
