I dont think they were on Takhisis's throne... I believe what happened was
Raistlin was drawing Queen Takhisis towards the portal so he could fight her
on his own plane. He was very weak from being stabbed, bludgeoned, etc.
Caramon entered the portal, he found Lady Crysania nearly dead, decided to
take her through the portal, saw Raistlin walking towards them, told
Raistlin their whole story, Raistlin gave Caramon the Staff of Magius (not
the Magi), they walked through, the portal got closed, the end. And what the
Queen threatened to do... "You will be tortured in mind and body. At the end
of each day, you will die from the pain. At the beginning of each night, I
will bring you back to life. You will not be able to sleep, but will lie
awake in shivering anticipation of the day to come. In the morning, my face
will be the first sight you see."

Sorry about being completely off topic.
