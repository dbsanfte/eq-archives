Might I suggest jumping gently...

But seriously, nothing wrong with that amount of hitpoints at your level.  I
do suggest to enchanters to try and be a little bit rounded in their
equipment because they tend to take hits so much, but for the most part
enchanter rune takes care of that better than any mount of +HP equipment
ever could.  As long as your CHA and INT are maxed (+mana and +hp after
that, followed by AC), I wouldn't worry about it too much.
