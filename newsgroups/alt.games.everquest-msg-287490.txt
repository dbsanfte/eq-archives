you do have some rights, but you don't have the right to behave
unreasonably with regard to *any* of your property, whether it's
saying no one can use your copyrighted work in a certain way or
whether it's saying anyone who steps on your lawn has the right to get
blown away by a landmine you planted

so i did a little more research, i looked up fair use

it's the idea that no reasonable copyright holder would object to
their copyrighted work under certain circumstances,

such as:

-when the use is private and not commercial
-when there is no impact on the market of the copyrighted material

and some other scenarios you should feel free to look up

in short,

the fact that it's private and not commercial is in fact *entirely*
relevant - i was right, you were wrong

("Stop using the word private, it's irrelevant. "  -Thu, 20 Mar 2008

and that there is no impact on the market, is, in the words of supreme
court justice o'conner in the case harper & row v national enterprises
(471 us 539), "undoubtedly the single most important element of fair
use"

and he goes on to say "fair use, when properly applied, is limited to
copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability
of the work which is copied"

it's not stealing according to the supreme court


this fair use applies here regardless of whether i created a
derivative work or a parody or whatever


QED!
