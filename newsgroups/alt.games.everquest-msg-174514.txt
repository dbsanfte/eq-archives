Seeing as though I can't get to the bazaar, I read somewhere the
bandits in Karana drop good newbie swords. I've wandered around there
before and killed a couple wandering around with no trouble so I
headed off in search of some more.

Came across a couple of them on the roadway, they both conned blue to
me so I though I should be able to handle the two of them. So I opened
up with flame lick from a distance and then switched to a longbow
before they closed. It all went bad fast after that.

Next thing I know i'm getting hit with spell after spell.... 35 points
here, 25 points there, one after the other .. I just got hammered so
fast I barely had time to see what was happening before I died. And
this was just -one- of them, the other one which I didn't attack just
stood there.

Why did they con blue to me when they were obviously way out of my
league ?

Another thing I seen was this giant tree looking thing. Conned red to
me so I kept a wide berth. Not sure if it would have gone aggro on me
or not, but it was like 40 foot tall so I didn't want to find out.
Sure does look impressive seeing things this large. Would almost be
worth be killed by a giant just to see it towering over you :)
