Monks are very misunderstood.

They make excellent tanks for low blue encounters . They have a very good ac
for there level but fall behind all other tanks and semi tanks in the hp
department. In other words they work best in the tank category when the mobs
are carefully controlled and the monk is buffed.

For most other encounters they are excellant dammage producers . Regretably
they where balanced pre kunark. Kunark weapons caused all other tank classes
to receive a 50% bonous on the dammage they where doing . This rebalanced
the monks to on par with the dammage of other tanks instead of in a
superiour spot they had once held.

Eventually the monks job will be to pull inside dungeons and lay on the
ground while watching the rest of his friends fight a mob :) Monks should
soon see a minor across the board increase in combat power if " the vision"
is serious about balancing classes.
