The tougher the mob the quicker the skill gains come (I think only
level matters).  Unfortunately, at your level anything at or near
an even con is gonna hurt you badly.  Aviak Avocets in South Karana
will be dark blue cons, and don't hit as hard as Kunark or Velious
mobs.  Were I you I would find some cheap AGI gear (AGI helps
defensive melee skill-ups), seek Blessing of Aegolism or Hand of
Virtue buff from a high level cleric (lotsa HP, lasts 2-1/2 hours),
go to SK, and find an Avocet to play patty-cake with.  Don't use a
DS (except maybe the 1 hp Thorncoat if you want Offense skill-ups),
you aren't there to kill the mob, you just want a decent sparring
partner.  If you have a Shaman or Ranger friend who could drop by
to buff your AGI once in a while that could speed matters along as
well.

Oh yeah, one more thing.  When you're done sparring, kill a dozen
or two chickens just to help you feel better about getting beat on
all that time.
