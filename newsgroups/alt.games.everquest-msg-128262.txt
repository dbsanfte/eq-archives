So, I know how I think this works, but lets see how
everyone else sees it.  I think I've seen some results
that tell me it doesn't work the way I thought it did,
perhaps its changed since the last time I did this sort
of thing, or maybe I was always wrong, or perhaps
I'm wrong now and I was right all along.

First, who can group and get exp?

Highest level in a group always gets exp on any mob
that isn't green to him
Anyone in group gets exp as long as highest level
isn't more than half again his level.
At very low levels, the minimum allowable spread
is 5 levels, so a level one can group with a level
6, a two with a seven, a three with an eight..and
so forth till "half again" is posting bigger gains than
"at least five more" which happens at 12 (can
group with 18 instead of just 17)

Second, how is exp divided.

A) mobs have a set exp total, which is split
by number of participants, and then each
modifies exp relative to their level... thus
a level 50 grouped with a level 40 gets same
exp per kill as if grouped with a second level
50... and you'd expect fewer kills per hour

B) current exp total of each group member
is turned into a ratio with overall group exp
total, and exp divided up according to that
set of ratios, and -then- modified according
to the level of each relative to the mob.  Thus
our 50 in the example above gets far more exp
per kill with a 40 than with a second level 50

Also, if a mob is green to the  higher level
but not green to the lower level does the lower
level get

1) exp as if soloing the mob
2) half the exp he'd get if soloing the mob, based
on split A) above
3) based on split B) above, a tenth what
he'd get if soloing the mob?

The above questions ignore the group bonus, which
I understand to be small if existing at all, particularly
with very small groups.  If the split is 51% + 51%
for a duo, or 92% + 10%, as opposed to 50% + 50%
versus 90% + 10 % the real question is clearly in the
more significant tenths digit column.

My understanding is that B) and 1) are both correct.
However recent hunting with my bard at 39 and my druid
friend partnered up at 57 lead me to believe that perhaps
the correct answer is A) and 2)... she thinks she got less
exp than she'd have expected off dark blue to her mobs,
while my exp per kill off the also dark blue to me mobs
was fantastic considering I had a high level partner.  At the
same time, while killing some green to her blue to me mobs,
I had the impression I was getting less exp per than I did
soloing them.

A side question, at high levels, where do the green, cyan,
and blue ranges fall?  Whats the overlap?  At 40 with
1) in effect, I'd love to group with someone to whom my blues
are as high as possible while still green to my partner.  As a
bard, I can dramatically alter the kills per hour rate of pretty much
any class I"m grouped with, so the best PL strategy for me
assuming this rule is in effect might be to group with someone
who can pharm exp to me mobs in bulk with my assistance,
essentially PLing myself.  Best targets for this, of course, would
be mobs that are in the correct range and have useful to the high
level drops or need killing in order to spawn desirable rare pops...
I'd have been happy to feed someone the volumnuous exp that
all went to waste during my cleric's epic goblin camps, for
example, only one mob in ten was even cyan to me.  Similar mobs
might be rockhoppers or grimling miners....
