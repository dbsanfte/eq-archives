   Yeah, I do.  But all the hard work has been done now.  Never heard of
XML I'm afraid.  My webpage writing skills really aren't what one could
call sophisticated.  I use an older version of CuteHTML which isn't a
WYSIWYG editor... it's more like notepad with a few features that make
adding the tags a bit easier.  And what I know about turning out a page
came from "HTML 4 Dummies", no kidding.  And speaking of notepad.. that's
what the newsgroup version of the FAQ is on.  Simple works for me.

   It's all done, pretty much.  Adding stuff and doing minor updates and
corrections really isn't that difficult at all, even with the two different
versions.
