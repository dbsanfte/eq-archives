    Let me list what a hunting ground needs to be used:

a) Needs to be close to a port in. More than one zone away from a port
point, and nobody will go there because nobody wants to run to hell and gone
to find out no group openings are available.
b) Needs to have a safe zone-in when the zone is at full pop. People will go
to such a zone to get in a pickup group, the dominant form of group at all
levels of the game. They will not zone into a zone where they can get
attacked on entry with reasonably high probability.
c) Faction cannot enter into the choice of hunting ground. If it does, it
had better be a faction that can be abandoned without problems.
d) Loot that has some trade value.

    Close to a port, for most folks faction isn't an issue. I've seen pickup
action here.

>Hate, Fear

    WIZ port only, both have dangerous zone-in points. The loot is No Drop,
and at the point you'd hunt here in a single group is likely useless. Unused
except for raids.

>Sebilis

    The classic pickup group zone.

>Chardok

    Now that it's been changed, gaining popularity.

>Karnor

    A good example of an "abandonable faction" zone. Again, a strong group
zone.

>Velk

    Since changes, a strong pickup zone.

>Icewell, Kael, Skyshrine

    Factioned in a place where faction matters. I only ever see raids in
these places, and they don't exactly let any old person join up.

>Western Wastes, Siren's Grotto, Dragon Necropois.

    Much too remote. SG is the only zone that's close to a TP, and it's got
a guarded zone-in point. Empty with reason.

    So of that list we have Velk, Karnor, Chardok, Seb, and sometimes The
Hole. A good list (and if we include Karnor then include Sol B Bats and
Bugs), but there could be more. Especially since that list has to service
the entire 50 plus crowd. Compare that with the list of raid-level stuff.
Hell, even for a guild like yours that's so elite it's insane there's at
least (per week) two days worth of activity in NToV, and some short
soujourns in Kael, Skyshrine, Sleeper's, and Fear. For most other guilds
there's Kael, Skyshrine, WW, DN, SG, ToV, Kunark dragons inc. VP, Chardok
royals, Sky, and a boatload of "lesser" encounters like epic mobs.
