And if you're going to argue Christian theology, do it right.

There is no book of Revelations in the Bible.  There is a book in the New
testament called 'Revelation'.

Toward the end of Revelation you're right .. once Satan is loosed from his
prison he's just doing his job.  However, in the earlier parts of the book
he/she/it is working against man for the puropse of screwing with God for
tossing him/her/it out of paradise.
