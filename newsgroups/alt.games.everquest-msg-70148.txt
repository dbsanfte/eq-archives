I've never played a rogue/monk before, but I started a Vah Shir
beastlord (rather rare on my server, believe it or not). They get
sneak as a racial ability. I was sneaking past some Loda Kai in
Shadeweaver's Thicket. I know I was successful because I /conned a
couple and they were indiff, and I was moving really slowly. But after
I'd gotten out of the danger range (thank Tunare) some of them started
shouting so I broke sneak and ran like hell. I didn't look back to see
if they were chasing me, but I'm assuming they were as I was the only
one in the area at the time. My question is, is there any kind of
skill check after you've successfully sneaked?
