You have me mixed up with someone else, just as
your "facts" get conveniently mixed up.

I have never mentioned Rush Limbaugh in any other
post.

Why are you lying about this?

>Oooh, yeah... the oh-so-unbiased FAIR.

Sorry... I didn't have an army grunt around to ask
for an expert opinion.

FAIR didn't do the research, did they?
The research comes from " Dr. Joseph Kelaghan, who
evaluates contraceptives for the National
Institutes of Health"

Is he biased too?

I don't think that they conduct clinical trials on
the failure rate of condoms, and it is those
people that I want the facts from.

>Just how many cases of STD's do you think a typical HMC has seen?

Now you are being dishonest again, aren't you?

You weren't talking about STD's, you were talking
about HIV. 

This is what you said;

"How many know that they are only 90% effective
against HIV?  I didn't until I was told so by a
navy Hospital Corpsman in
boot camp. "

>How many WESTPACs do you think the average HM1 has gone on, where half the
>ship is lined up outside medical after a port call in Singapore?

And exactly how do HM's work out who has HIV after
a port call in Singapore, when the poor victim
will may well have no idea when and where he
picked it up?

Are you saying that anyone going ashore routinely
gets tested for HIV?

>Oh, and the statistics were from the CDC, IIRC.

So post them and stop with the bullshit.

Except its not me who says so. If I produce
statistics, then they are properly attributed, and
not from some unnamed guy I met in a park,
otherwise people (like me) would say, you are
talking out of your ass.

Remington gave some figures as well, pick one you

You're a liar.

I believe you are pushing some right wing
Christian bullshit and that you don't like the
thought of anyone having unauthorised sex, even if
the dangers were at absolute zero.
