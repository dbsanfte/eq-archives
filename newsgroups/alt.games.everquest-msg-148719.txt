You have to be actively engaged in killing the mob.  Sitting in the foyer
with no force ready is not engaged.  Sitting in front of the mob is not
engaged.  Kiting the mob around without doing any damage is not engaged.
Engaged is having a credible force there actively killing the mob.  If you can't

do at least 1% damage to the mob you really aren't credible yet.

Now most people will give you more latitude than this on most mobs, say if
you have a credible force in front of him buffing up, you will usually get
ten minutes or so to get on with it... but shouting over an open channel
trying to recruit warm bodies to help you isn't credible at all.  Using the
bazaar channel is even less so, now you are simply alerting everyone
on your server to the fact that the mob is up and you -don't- have a force.

You should have a guild to do this sort of mob.  Failing that, you should
work on building a substantial Friends list, and contact those people
to look for help.  Failing that (hopefully just to plug a couple strategic
holes in your raid force) use direct tells to LFG people in guilds you
are familiar with as honorable.  But remember, every person you
ask is one more person who may leak the presence of the mob to
his guild or a friend... and even if the person you contacted is
trustworthy, someone he tells about it may not be.

At the higher end of the game, you'll see guilds going anon when
preparing to do any FFA mob, so that other guilds don't see
their forces moving towards a given zone, make a lucky guess
as to whats up, and move in and Gank it.  Note the word "gank,"
which is similar to Kill Steal, but describes instead what we are
talking about here; taking a mob that someone else is setting up
for but has not yet engaged.  Its rude, but its not against the rules,
while actual Kill Stealing is.
