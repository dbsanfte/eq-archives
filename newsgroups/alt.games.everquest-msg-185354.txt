Lol, I finally dinged level 40 this morning.  This surely has to be one of the
slowest crawls up the level ladder in EQ.  He's my main and he's a soloing high
elf wizard.  I checked after I finally made 40 and his birth date was Aug 19th
1999 and he's been played for over 40 days.  I don't get to play much and it
almost never happens that I get more than an hour at one shot so I've mostly
had to solo.  If you can't tell, I'm pretty damn proud!!
