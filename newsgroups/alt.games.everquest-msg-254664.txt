    See, if you'd worked on your AA's, you could have insta-cast Bestow
Divine Aura on yourself while you were running and lived! ;-)

    This is the "you can't AFK" part of the raid. Works wonders for getting
people to pay attention. For those who haven't been there: everyone huddles
in a little room, with a door in front and a door behind you that you came
in. There's four keys sitting on a table at the side of the room. Once the
door you came in closes, you can begin. Every six to ten seconds or so,
everyone gets an emote about hearing grinding stone. One person in the raid,
random every time, will also get a message saying that the grinding stone is
the lock changing which key is required, but you can tell what key to use.
This person will either get the message "You need the X key", or "You need
either the X or Y key". The front door will only open if the right key is
used on it before the next emote. If the wrong key is used, three waves of
something like 4 K damage hit the raid. In addition, for every person that
dies anywhere in Uqua, a hostile mob will pop and attack until it despawns
in 20 seconds or so. So using the wrong key is pretty much a raid wiper (you
can survive with a fully extended Divine Aura cast at the right time, but
it's not easy). It sure is easy to tell how many people are not paying
attention when nobody is telling the raid what key to use after each emote.

    The AE is blocked by geometry. So depending on where you place the mobs,
there's a lot of hiding places.

    Both mobs can randomly teleport people fighting one mob to the other
mob. So if you're fighting mob A, suddenly POOF - you're with the people
fighting mob B. So if you have enough aggro, you get splatted when the MT
goes poof.

> We kill the rest of the guardians, and with that, the zonewide AE goes

    If you don't kill the prior stuff fast enough, the AE doesn't go away
until Barxt is dead and those trinkets lose the ability to block it. We've
killed him once that way, and we certainly don't want to do it again,
especially because each time the AE goes off you get a nice long emote
reminding you that you failed.

    There's one wave of adds, triggered by Barxt's health, which is pretty
nasty. I'm surprised you don't mention doing anything special with them, or
that they're even there, as they really are the toughest part of the
encounter.

    The effect on the priest Qvic arms, which everyone will get eventually,
is +45% to direct heals. That's likely why not many people went in on it.
Also be careful - that focus works only for single target heals, not for
group heals.

> I honestly have no clue what our next step in GoD progression is.

    Next zone is Inktu'ta, instanced zone off Qvic. It's tough but fun.
After that comes Txevu, where you'll see muramite legs and BPs and trash
clears that will remind you of Vex Thal all over again. Finally, after that
comes Tacvii - the end zone.
