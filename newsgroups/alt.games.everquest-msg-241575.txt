Is anyone else experiencing crashes when it rains in the zone you're in? If
I'm playing and it begins to rain, I can guarantee I'll crash...and if I log
back in, I'll continue crashing as long as the rain is falling. It gets very
annoying, especially last night hunting seafury cyclopses with Claviger and
crashing while he's at 50% health or less...

My system is a PIII 450, 320mb RAM, 32mb PCI ATI Radeon 7000 video card
(until last night - switched it out with an AGP NVidia Geforce 2 with 32mb,
but still crashed this morning in Oggok when it rained). Since I switched
out the video card, I'm pretty certain that's not the problem (and both
cards had the latest drivers). Wondering if I need to update the drivers for
anything else...

I've filed 2 bug reports, one when I was using the ATI, the second this
morning while using the NVidia. When it's not raining, I seem to be fairly
stable (which is good, because I wasn't all that stable before), but would
like to be stable even when the weather is bad. :P
