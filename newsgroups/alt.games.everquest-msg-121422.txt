I think this has been the one single thing that pisses me
off more than any of 'em.  It rarely happens, but have you ever
had a caster 40 levels below you stick Drowsy on you?

How many level 9 players could get Drowsy to stick on
the Frenzied Ghoul or on Servitor?  EVER?  Even ONCE?
Having some damn level 30 goblin wizard in Droga hitting
me for lots of damage with 100+ resists in normal gear
at level 60 just pisses me off.  Not to mention the one time
I backstabbed a goblin bloodtracer while farming Grachnist
and he hit me with a DoT AFTER being hit for 32k damage...

I agree with the changes in the NPC's AI, especially as pertains
to casting spells that are more level appropriate.  I think it
will be fun with a level 25 alt running into a goblin AoE storm
in HPH, but I do not think it's fair to run into an elemental
wizard that triples for 110+ and casts Lure based spells.
If he's gonna get smarter about his spell casting, dumb down
his melee.  Unless one of the new Cleric AA points becomes
"Defensive Discipline" or something silly like that.

Oh, and the bare-handed backstabs have GOT to go.  I don't
care if you stick a rusty dagger in their hands, I'm sick of seeing
plaguebone thieves backstab you with empty hands.  It just
pisses off the roguish part of me.
