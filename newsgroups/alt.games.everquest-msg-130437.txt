Most likely you were getting ignored because you weren't offering enough
compensation for what you wanted.  If you really want a port fast shout that
you're trading KEI or even clarity for it, shouldn't take more than 5
minutes, every porter likes more mana regen.  Of course, if you're not an
enchanter that doesn't help you, but I'd rather ignore 50 people that ask me
for a port (especially since more than 50% of those losers want to go to GD
where I crash every other time I zone in, I *never* port people to GD unless
they're either a friend, casting KEI on me or a very recent ex-groupmate)
than port them all for 50pp each and waste 2 hours of my time.

Of course, it's equally easy to ignore /shouts as /tells, but ignoring the
/tells is a bit more annoying because I'm more likely to get a followup
along the lines of "will you port me or not????? plzzzzzzzz".  (not saying
that's what you do, just that it happens)

Granted, this thread started about a bind, not a port, I'd probably never
refuse to help someone bind in a strange city where they're potentially kos
(particularly Qeynos or Freeport with their asstastic faction arrangements),
but I rarely hang out anywhere that it matters.
