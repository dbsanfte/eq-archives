Social mobs are not good news for a soloing berserker; we can 
effectively "slow" one mob by stunning it every 12 seconds, but adds do 
full damage, and we are at best relying on regen for heals during a 
fight, and bandages in between (till 45 when we can get a clicky hp buff 
that works like the famous clicky DW hat for paladins); this means 
keeping the damage down to a managable level becomes very important... 
and we have no root or other method of CCing already pulled mobs.

Finding targets that are either not social, or that are generally 
seperated by enough distance to get single, is very important to a solo 
berserker.
