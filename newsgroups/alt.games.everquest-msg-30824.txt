Un, exactly what are we supposed to defend?

Bizbee was vintage bizbee, TwoHead amused me. And there's a difference
between hitting a woman for not having dinner on the table in time,
and cursing at someone blatantly stupid enough to drive 20 miles over
the speed limit with a policecar in plain view. We're not submissive
punching bags, but we're also not porcelain dolls who'll drop dead at
the slightest criticism of our ways - at least, most of us aren't.

Is that more like the defense you wanted?
