}Insidejoke.tv makes me think this is poking a little fun, but I have seen

}system resources.  Rebooting always did the trick.

Yea, I always got that when I was trying to run 4 EQW sessions on the same 
computer at once.  Sometimes I could still get whatever it was done with 
the crappy blocky look, though. :)  Move zin near twink, tar twink, /cast
