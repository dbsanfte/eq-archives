Ran into two genuises.

Screwing around in Blackburrow, can't remember how the character introduced
himself, something like asked my chr to group or buffs or something. He was
to low to group, something like level 8 druid or so. He complained he was
having trouble gaining levels and asked if I would PL him a bit. So I stands
around watching him for a few and notice he is trying to take down stuff
using only melee.

I says; "You know you can cast spells while you melee"
He say; ~"Oh, like what?"
I says, "You want to start off with something like flamelick and cast burst
of fire"
He says "It says I am missing a fire beetle eye"

So run around getting him a fire beetle eye and making sure he has the right
spells.

After 3-4 more minutes of standing there repeatedly going "CAST BURST OF
FIRE!" he started to get it. Saw him about 2 days later and he was level 15
and never saw him again after that. I assume he went on to greener pastures.

So I tells myself, probably just some good natured 8 year old trying to
figure out the game, probably won't run into someone that inexperienced
again. That's my happy story.

So I have one of my fletcher out on a Trueshot Bow run. Passing through
Highpass on the way to homebase of Qeynos I get repeated invites to join an
Orc group by a level 16 ranger. Ok, bound to Qeynos but almost no chance of
death, poor sucker obviously moved here too soon and nobody else around.
Can't remember the first Orc pulled, something like an Orc Cleric. Guy took
forever to get into the fight and when he does, he brings two Orc warriors
with him. So it is a little 3 on 1, my fletcher being the 1. Pretty much
handling the cleric almost dead, but with 3 Orcs beating on my character I
am getting to about 1/2 life. I had my traveling spells up mostly, things
like camouflage and not a lot of DD stuff, I go with what I have.

I tell Mr. Ivanagroup "Say, do you think you could help out a bit by casting
a spell or two?"

He says "I don't have any memorized"

I zoned. I disbanded. I got called a jerk by Mr. Ivanagroup. I continued on
to Qeynos.

That's the one thing wrong with grouping; it doesn't weed out the complete
idiots. I imagine someone could make it to 30 w/o having a clue how to play
the game. The bright side is that if he does make it to 30, his casting
skills will still be in the single digits.
