Damn biz.  Haven't you ridden that "one and only post to usenet"
horse to death yet?  The guy posts a commentary on EQ in an EQ
newsgroup, *gasp* how dare he!  Oh, and he isn't the only player
who finds the game less and less interesting, especially in light
of the "Hey!  All you wannabe ubers!  Over here!  Just give your
dollars to Sony McMonkey McBean / and hop in our wondrous transfer
machine / to Maelin Starpyre where no uberguild has yet been seen"

The sole remaining question for Kaev is:   SIGAMS?
