Sure, as with all things EQ, it can be kludgy, particularly if you are 
in lag.

But it usually worked pretty well... which suggests to me that it was 
tic based, even if client and server disagreed sometimes about exactly 
when that tic actually took place.

The counterarguement is that mana actually accumulates gradually, and 
for some reason the client artificially displays it on a tic basis, but 
its lying.   My experience suggests otherwise.
