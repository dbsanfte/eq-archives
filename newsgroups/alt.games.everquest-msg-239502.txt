This has happened many times on my bard,lucky I was tracking and found the
pop near zones edge. Was killing a nightfall hill giant in WC (near undead
tower) got him to 20% health as he started to run.I went up to him (he was
running to EC) and before I could swing my swords he disappeared at 10%
health. /petition WTF blah blah blah. while my bard track still said a
nightfall hill giant is behind to the left.So I ran with selo's and found
him near kithicor zone line.Started talking in guild and found this is a
normal problem even to tank types (though it happens more rare).
