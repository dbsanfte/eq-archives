 I would STRONGLY support a decent player-notes capability,
 more than just /friend and /ignore, and preferably sharable (or selectively
sharable) across characters, friends, and guildmates.

This is something I always wanted too, or at least a note field in the 
ignore so you could remember why you stuck them on ignore. Another thing I 
thought would be neat was an adjustable con system for the players. It's 
already in the game so just change it a little, that when you target a 
player you could type /tcon idiot (foe) or /tcon ally etc. Then the next 
time you con them you see your setting for them.
