No need to worry for a good 20 levels?  I suppose so, if you don't mind
having to make up something in the neighborhood of 150-200 archery skillups.

What I've done is work on fletching, get a whole mass of cheapie arrows from
it (the sort of thing I'll never be able to sell in the bazaar) and bowkite
until they run out, at which point I move on to other things.  I've never
been more than 20 below the skillcap at any point since I started doing that
in the high teens.

Also, instead of Sergeant Slate, I'd suggest McCluskey in West Karana.
