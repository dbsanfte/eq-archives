Absolutely, and I'm all for the spirit of the law.  I believe I have stated
more than once, that the name Lokari does not bother me.  I would also add,
that most any other fantasy oriented name, whether from popular literature
or not, does not bother me either.  Stupid names bother me, but I leave
alone, offensive names bother me, and I report them.  Some people posting in
other threads on the subject have stated quite clearly that the rules must
be obeyed, and anyone who can't obey them is a childish idiot, or words to
that effect.  I think that the point has been made.
