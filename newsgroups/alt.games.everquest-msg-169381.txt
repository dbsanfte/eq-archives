Yes... because we all need to lean to think. When will people lean that
watching television is very hopless? All of you rejects just make me think
its all so hopless... [sic]

I don't mean to be a spelling Nazi, but I think someone needed to point out
the irony of your post. You are thrown into a rather infantile conniption
and begin babbling about how stupid the people that don't agree with you
are, which implies that you believe yourself to be superior. However, in
classic foot-in-mouth form, you then make a few mistakes that must surely be
below someone of your self-proclaimed intellect.

In other words, your comment is akin to "Why can't people talk good?"
