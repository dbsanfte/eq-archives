If you happen to have a Bard along, it should be possible to
walk out as well.  Played continuously, the Bard levitation
song will "pump" you higher and higher every song pulse.
There's a limit to the height you can achieve, but it should
be more than enough to get up and over the minor drop-off
on the "ramp" that usually blocks people from getting back up
to the entrance on foot.

Just about anywhere.  Other than the named mobs (various
places), the rat jail (not far inside the first "castle"),
and the undead tower (WAY deep), most of the Hole has
the same mix of mobs everywhere.

Just pick a spot you like that has a steady supply of
mobs and a good place to pull to.

As another poster mentioned go to the right of the "golem guarded
bridge" and just drop off there.  You'll take about 200 damage,
but the number of wanderers is low.  As you drop you'll encounter
0, 1, or 2 earth elementals, max, depending on your timing.

Also, chain-aggro resulting in a train is often a problem in
the Hole.  We had a bitch of a time getting past a certain
spot each time we went to do another Ranger epic mob until
we learned that level is *everything* when it comes to
pulling in the Hole.  It turned out that my (then) 58 Paladin
was a better puller there than the 54 Monk.  I could get
a single pull almost every time -- double if another mob
was too close.  I never caused a massive train.  But
the Monk, even using FD, had a hard time not getting 3-6
at a time.

The same is true of "fight aggro".  If you have sub-55
people in your group -- and since you're 52, you will --
make sure that your fight spot is far enough away from
any wanderers or static spawns, or else they'll come
running to help and you'll be swarmed.

Do *not* fight near houses, doors, etc.  Hug
the cave walls as much as possible when fighting
or tiptoeing to new territory.

Also remember that while it's an indoor zone and
Harmony is out of the question, the Cleric/Paladin
Lull line of spells has been upgraded to actually
be useful, and does a fine job of helping to
separate pulls from closely spaced mobs.
