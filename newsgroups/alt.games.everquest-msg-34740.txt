Good but not evil enough.  How about a generic zone used for all epics,
spawned independantly when a final item is turned in just like your
scenario.  Character is now teleported into this zone alone, and the
final event begins.  For some classes perhaps a single creature to be
dealt with, for others a series of creatures to be dealt with, or for
Rogues perhaps a series of creatures and traps to be avoided.  Here's
the evil part.... succeed and you receive your epic reward (note: in
this scenario assume all epic rewards are truly epic.), fail and find
yourself at lvl 25 (don't gasp, I started out thinking permanent death
<EG>).  Now having that epic in your hands means something.  You stood
alone and faced not only the encounter, but your fears.  You risked half
your life or more and came out the victor.  Yup, that would be the sort
of thing folks might stand back in awe of when they saw you approach
rather than note which guild did the job.

OK, so my idea of fun is not necessarily everyone's idea of fun hehe. 
Yes indeed, I can just see my gaming world now....
