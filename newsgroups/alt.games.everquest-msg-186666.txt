Bad examples, but the point is the same.

VP was really cleared too late to have been farmed, most, if not all guilds
were in Velious anyway when they were VP-capable.

ST was a totally different ball-game.. the first clearing of it would
destroy the zone permanently, for 2 years.

ToV(north), Vexthal and the like are how PoT will be farmed (i think!)
