I'd go with the geforce 4 ti 4200 128 meg, 4 ti 4400 128 meg or the
one  you mention 4 ti 4600 128 meg. Make sure its 128 meg AND if
you can get the 8x agp versions which are out now. In the case of the
4200 the 8x agp is just a little more than 4x. You probably don't even
have an 8x motherboard, but might upgrade to one later. Any of those
cards will be good for a few years at least with the only difference
between the three being raw frame rate. Ijust got a 4200 128 meg.

Hmm actually I see now there is not much diff between 4x and 8x agp on
the card and only the 4200 has it so far?

Unless your parents are very computer savvy, this is semi dangerous.
You may be very explicit about what you want and end up with a Geforce
4 MX 64 meg, which they saw cheaper and they are "sure is the same."
This card is outdated before you even open it and is crap.

I'd go geforce all the way. It seems to be what new game manufactuers
target the most and is the standard. Nvidia makes new drivers every
other day, supporting ALL of their cards with the same driver all the
way back to the venerable tnt 1 and beyond. I've never seen a vid card
maker do that. This means that in 7 years you could still be using
your geforce 4 4600 or whatever with the newest drivers supporting
direct x 15. You probably would not want to, but you could.

Up until a few months ago I was playing EQ/ through luclin on my p2
400 with a tnt 16 meg agp card with all luclin models enabled and I
played OK outside of raids or the bazaar. I just decided it was
finally time for an upgrade since I got that tnt about when I started
playing beta phase 3 of EQ. So the card was over three and a half
years old and still supported by full direct x 8.1 drivers.

Another bonus is that if you wever want to get into linux, nvidia
makes their OWN very nice SuSE/mandrake/red hat card driver which
also supports all their cards with 3d acceleration under linuxs. I
also don't know of anyone who does that and constantly updates them.

Geforce FX is the bomb I guess, but won't be out for a while. You
won't see it before christmas and I heard it will start at 500 bucks?
Doubtless that price will drop to half that soon though.

Go over to nvidia and there is a video you can watch of the geforce FX
demo show (somewhere in the geforce fx area) I just watched it while
making this post. It streams but the whole thing is 145 meg. Takes a
couple hours to watch it even without pauses on a cable modem. Fun
stuff. It shows real time character movements with the cloth shader
engine of everquest two characters, their dawn character, the new
command and conquer two game with a dam bursting, all in real time
using the FX. 

After showing this the guy from Sony Online said that they expect
you'll be able to have 30 to 40 of these detailed EQ people on the
screen at once, in all their glory, with no big frame rate hit.

As far as raw frame rate its about a 1/3 improvement in current day
games such as unreal 2003 or quake 3 over the geforce 4 4600 ti.
These still are not making much use of the new features of the card
though. It looks to me like we are finally getting to the point where
the graphics card is truely taking most of the 3d load on itself
meaning  the 2 ghz or so proc computer with 512 meg of memory may not
have to be upgraded every 2 years, but perhaps just the graphics card.
