Pure Blood has been in the live spells_en for a while now, no telling if
it's actually available now though.

Summon companion is vendor sold for other classes though iirc, so we should
be able to snag it and scribe now (btw, it will not work on charmed or dire
charmed pets, only on booboo.)

At least they're still holding off on implementing the 60+ charm nerfs
(enchanters need nerfing on charm somehow, everybody else's charms have
alternative balancing methods that make it stupidly stupid to nerf.)
