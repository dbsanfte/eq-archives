/report and /petition them. Then spend some time being a complete
nuisance. Things like squirming right in between them and the banker
when they attack her and jumping up and down. Keeping your character
right up in their face at all times. Emote the heck out of them. Keep
your character right in front of them wherever they go, jumping around
and being just as big an inconvenience as you can be.

Best case, you make their time unenjoyable while they wait for a
response to their *own* petition against you, with you ultimately
getting off scott-free and them getting reprimanded for zone
disruption.

Worst case, the guide shows up and slaps you both on the hand and
tells you to knock it off.

Either way, they quit killing the banker. I'd call it personal
satisfaction in either case, but, then again, I'm a grouchy vindictive
sort.  :)
