OMG, yes, because apologies are SO hard to make.  Typing out words you
might never mean or stand behind is a hard task, and that guy should be
given a lot of respect for this.

/sarcasm off

apologies?  The whole idea behind an apology is that someone BELIEVES that
you are actually ashamed/regretful.
