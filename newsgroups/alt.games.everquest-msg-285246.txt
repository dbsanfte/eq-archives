 No way to really know if they infact cancelled and how many others
might have to. If you read the stories (various website, take with a
grain of salt) EQ is losing its customer base. 400k 2 years ago when I
started to something like 250k now. It was even mentuioned that the
game would still be viable with a 50k player base. Can you say empty
zones big time.

 Basically if it floats your boat keep playing if thats your choice.
Unless theres one hell of a big change I will be walking away from it.
Wow is rather interesting. No glitches, no broken quests, no lag, good
graphics, enough of a storyline to keep me playing. Now I've only been
around 1 area, the undead section, so there might very well be a big
old bug waiting to bite me in the ass.

Oh on the downside somene tried to killsteal a named from me. Same
class but one level higher. They lost. Gotta love the looting system
(from what I've seen). No ninja looting and it seems like 50%+ rule is
there as well.
