I should point out that cleric+snarer can fear kite as well. Clerics get
a line of fear spells - we just hardly ever use them, because without snare
they're pretty useless. But cleric+ranger, for example, can fear kite.
(Hmm, have to try that some time.)

You could scale them by level or some other skill...  there are various ways
they could implement it, and the extra skills for different classes would
have to be chosen carefully.

Anyway, it's not going to happen - would require too many changes to the
game code and tuning would be next to impossible.

I agree. It's the main point I've been trying to make. Basically, at 61+,
*only* the POP zones fail to turn green, or at best light blue. Warriors
cannot get into PoP exp groups. Ergo, Warriors need to have some balancing
capability that lets them into such groups.

If they can't get into such groups, they need to be given some other way
of earning experience... which is why I keep mentioning warriors' inability
to solo.

It's not something I've ever spent time trying to observe, so I'll assume
you're right. I never personally saw that conflict in action, however, so
the net effect on the ability to get a group strikes me as small.

They're not, now, which is what several people have been saying.

I agree, Taunt would need to be adding serious aggro. It would need
considerable tuning, and allowance would need to be made for the fact
that the knights are using a consumable resource (mana) where the
tanks are not...

One other idea would be to have Taunt generate egregious amounts of
aggro, *but* the MOB always then hits for max damage for its next attack
on the tank. That takes advantage of one of the tank's main plus points
(high HP) while reducing the edge that they have over the knight classes.

The Warrior is already good enough at causing damage compared to a knight;
no reason to increase that edge.

I don't think that Warriors should erase the knights. The current
situation needs rebalancing; handing the key advantage of knights (aggro)
to warriors needs to be carefully done, hopefully in such a way that the
three classes are roughly of equal desirability as tanks.

My main concern is that Sony will pull their usual trick of balancing the
ultra-high end game, that perhaps one or two thousand people across
*all* the servers see, and ignore the effects on the other 99% of players.
Adding a weapon on the Elemental planes that generates huge aggro would
be their usual approach and help almost nobody.

Either the aggro booster should have a serious drawback (cut AC by 40% for
five seconds after use; allow MOB one attack at max damage...) or the
knights need some boosting (perhaps disc defensive lasting half as long)
if warriors are given a serious aggro boost.

I can see where you're coming from, but you don't seem to have been
grasping the extent to which warriors are currently left out of high-end
exp groups. Telling someone to start an alt fails to address the core
problem - which is that ideally, all classes should be reasonably
balanced, and currently it's not the case.
