Thats bad. But I bring at least some good news; spent something over
an hour killing all the shadowed men in west commons (dead as soon as
they spawned). I actually came away from it with 7 essense of shadows,
which isn't all that shabby.

I don't think they WANT those elementals in SF dropping much swirling
mists, since they're so low level. The problem is there's almost no
medium level elementals out there they could put them on, a few in
najena on the low side, then almost nothing until you get to the Hole.

Still, they definately need to be boosted still.
