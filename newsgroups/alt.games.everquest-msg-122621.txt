I generally say "ty" or "thanks" in the rare situation somebody gives me a
drive-by buff, as a monk I obviously can't buff them back...

But I would never *ever* scam somebody, when I was early 50's (no weapons,
ccs, fbss etc) somebody asked me to trade their fungi and RBB to their alt
char, and as he camped out he said "Thats how much I trust you!"   (I got
scammed just before that, losing my godly (and only weapon) a jade mace, so
trust was non-existant in the game for me)
