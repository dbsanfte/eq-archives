Perhaps the reason you see things that I don't is that I make an
effort to focus on a persons *actual* behavior, instead of letting
personal prejudice against them color my perceptions.

No, the *original* *poster* put it out there for everyone to see. It's
*publicly* *available* information. I'm sorry that you cannot grasp
the distinction.

>You haven't convinced me any different with your weak reply.

Drake, I've long since ceased being interested in convincing you of
anything. I think I lost that interest after the second time you
claimed to have kill filed me. 

My only interest is in pointing out idiocy where I see it. It's just
coincidence that you are such a large source of it.
