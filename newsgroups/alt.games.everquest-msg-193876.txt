Aye I have been using cast BOR on raids whenever mana permitted, and it works
on me with my Haste of Mithaniel item or people with mage summon haste items...
thing is its hard to recall that it matters more to other classes than it does
to clerics; my most important spells are Supernal Remedy (too fast to be
affected) and CHeal (never affected).  Enchanters particularly love it though.

Free and no spell slot taken up, I'm going to have to build the habit of
keeping it on lots of people all the time.  Outdoor zones I can be on my horse
while clicking it so it won't cast me any med time either, thats another plus.

More I think about it the less lame it seems.

I still miss clicky CHeal off my Donal's BP though.
