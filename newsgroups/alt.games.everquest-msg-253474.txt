From any LDoN Magus TL to Nedaria's Landing off Jaggedpine. From
Nedaria's Landing TL via Magus to either Natimbi or Abysmal Sea.
Abysmal is kind of the PoK of GoD... huge ship where you can buy
anything/do quests.

Natimbi is open zone where you could in fact solo.
From Natimbi... next zone is Qinimi.... should be able to solo here
but much harder mobs
From Qinimi you go to Barindu... Barindu is where the instanced zone
trials are. This is the zone where most of the action takes place
until you can get Kod Taz flagged.

All 3 zones... Natimbi, Qinimi, and Barindu will contain KOS mobs to
you so run through them invis and watch where you are walking. This is
also true for CR's. To CR an instanced zone you have to run through
these 3 zones invis to get back to the instanced zone line.

There are two other open zones.. Ferubi(raid or full good group 65)
and Riwwi(haven't tried this much).

>Anything else I should know about, for example the Tribute thing?

Tribute is done via the Tribute Masters in your hometown. When you get
in town just do Ctrl-F... select the tribute master and hit find. Path
leads the way and you turn in items for favor and then spend favor on
buffs. Buffs can be any focus effect along with stat enhancers.

What about them? :> Not the person to answer that.
