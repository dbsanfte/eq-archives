Can't comment on archery, but in regards to melee my DPS might be higher
because 1) at certain levels I have self-only ATK buffs and procs and 2)
with KEI I can toss in DoTs and Nukes (without worrying about aggro
too...thank you Jolt!).

I'm starting to get down-right excited about my 63+ nukes.  Since I still
haven't caught the excitement about archery, I'm going to go for casting
AA's (and ornate boots with FT3) after I get some defensive locked down,
because I had no idea how fun being a fighter-mage would be.  That's what
I think I love most about the Ranger class...from the moment you start on
your archetype AAs up until you have so many AAs that you can do
everything, you really can specialize what you are.  Ranger Tank.  
Archer. Fighter Mage.  Is it that way for other hybrids too?

Anyone remember that little fox knight (Sir Didimus) in the movie the
Labyrinth?  Little fox with a stick bouncing around yelling squeaky taunts
and generally making a nuisance of himself? He's my role model. :D  That
and Fizgig from the Dark Crystal. It's a toss-up.
