The way I play MMOGs, I will play EQ2, WoW, and any others that look
promising (haven't explored Matrix Online or Middle Earth Online, both of
which supposedly are due out this year), and I'll play my heart out while
I'm in them. I only play one at a time, so I'll likely stagger them if they
come out simultaneously. Unlike many here who have stated they will try
several and stick with one, or who keep looking for the ultimate MMOG, I
don't view MMOGs as a lifetime proposition. In all the ones I've played (UO,
EQ, AC, AO, DAoC, AC2, SWG, TSO, CoH) I've found something wonderful and
have had great adventures and stories to tell, but also have found that my
interest is never enough to warrant buying more than a 3-month plan at the
most (and more usually a month-to-month). I have not regretted this approach
and I don't expect to change with any of the new games on their way to us. I
plan to keep on dating as long as I can, no weddings for me in the
forseeable future.
