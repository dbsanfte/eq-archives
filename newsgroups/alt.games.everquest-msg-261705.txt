I make mine as follows;

/pause 30, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/cast 1

The pause command is placed at the start of the line and actually occurs
after the cast, kind of backwards but its the way it works. The pause will
have to be adjusted depending on the delay of the spell your using, takes
some trial and error.
