Not really a problem in practice...

Just keep your `shout' channel open and there'll be lots of low level 
characters screaming if either spectres or giants make it to the shore.
And in this case the best place to be is in the water, while the people
on shore lead it to the zone line.
  
It's worth it though, watching the crocs swim through the water and 
chasing them or swimming next to them is great fun. And sometimes you'll
get a lot of them in the water to play with.
