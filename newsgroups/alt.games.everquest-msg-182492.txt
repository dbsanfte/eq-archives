    Well, if I could make 300pp in 10 mins doing almost anything I'd say I'd
go for it, but then I'm not level 62 yet (nearly 51 now and surprisingly im
paying 20pp for KEI these days because I feel i've got that much to spend on
it)

    Yeah, if I personally contacted a chanter who WASN'T actively selling
KEI, even if they were in nex, I'd donate at least 50pp and more than that
if they had to come to some out fo the way zone. I paid 200pp for a rez the
other night because that was fair. But I object to paying exorbitant rates
for one cast of a spell they you dont have to move for, risk anything for,
or do anything much for... Stressful herds of kei-hungry nerds aside lol
