Hail,

(/ooc - I am seeking to start a guild following the principles of Jesu
Christus.  If you would like to join please email me at
lukewilla@bigpond.com or /tell me on Mith Marr server.  A summary of this
guilds beliefs are as follows)

Before time was there existed an eternal Being, often called the Nameless.
This Being is infinite, all-knowing, all-powerful and is the Creator of all.
He is also a Person, He has feelings, can reason, and has morals.  Because
He is the most important thing that exists His value is infinite, and in
following the wisest choice of His own counsel, the Most High One must
choose Himself above all else.  To do any less would be to cause HIs own
detriment and the detriment of all that depended upon Him.

This aspect of His Being is the basis of Truth, Love and Life.  Truth is
valuing everything according to its value in relation to the ultimate, or
the High One Himself.  Love is treating everything according to its value.
Life is living in truth and love.  The Creator values all things as they
should be, and treats all things as they should be.  HE IS the source of all
Truth, Love, and Life.  All His other attributes are based upon these
principles.  Whether He sits in the Judgment Seat or extends the Sceptre of
Mercy it is always done in Truth and Love, that is, He does it in respect to
the recipients value.

In the beginning of time the Most High created the universe with all its
worlds.  One particular world was the world of Norrath.  He populated this
world with all kinds of creatures, and everything He made was perfect and
lived in harmony.  Among the creatures He formed He also created many
rational beings - beings capable of experiencing the truth and love He
exhibits.  But they rejected His system, and each one valued themselves as
the most important things in the universe, turning away from love and
embracing selfishness.  Since the time when our anscestors rebelled all
rational beings have sought their own first, valuing themselves as the
ultimate to the detriment of the universe, throwing everything into chaos
and unleashing every imaginable horror.

To protect His creation from forever being destroyed in this rebellion He
instituted the penalty of selfishness - DEATH.  Death involved more than
breathing your last, it meant separation from the Sustainer Himself, the
source of Truth, Love, Life - forever.

But as is consistent with His nature, He did not just abandon His creation,
but sought to reconcile them back to Himself and the Way of Life.  He did
this by becoming a mortal Himself, under the name of Jesu Christus.  For a
time He walked the paths of this world, exhibiting the Truth, the Love, and
the Life.  But we still rejected Him, and hated Him all the more for
exposing our darkness.  In rage we killed Him, the Creator, the Ultimate One
of the Universe, He Who had done no wrong.

But how foolish we were, to think that Death could hold the King of Kings.
Nay, He conquered death and rose from the grave.  He gathered what followers
He could find, and through the power of His Love that He had shown by
sacrificing Himself in place of our rebellion, He transformed them into
disciples of Love - seeking to treat all things according to their eternal
value.  To such He gives Life - to be with the source of Love forever.

I am one of those disciples, I was once lost, consumed by my own
selfishness, valuing myself above all else.  But He opened my eyes to the
Truth, He taught me Love, and He gave me Life.  And now I go forth,
proclaiming the Truth, showing through His strength the power of Love, and
giving the Life -  Life Eternal.  I am, a Knight of Eternity, what is your
destiny?
