Actually, a more interesting question is exactly what is provoking this 
wave of hatred against the French from the US? That they dare to have a 
differing opinion, and dare to act on it? Among my circle of friends in 
Europe, I'm the only one who has spent a significant amount of time in 
America, and because of that, I'm used to play the devil's advocate for 
the US, but even I am at a complete loss to explain to them why, in a 
country supposedly governed by adults, members of Congress would do 
something as childish and petty as renaming the French fries in their 
menus...

Where does that complete inability to deal with any dissent come from, 
that makes adult statesmen behave like spoiled children throwing a 
tantrum? Why has the US, after winning the Cold War, turned out to be so 
painfully ungracious in victory, that even the enormous surge of 
sympathy and support worldwide after 9/11 has taken only a year to 
evaporate completely?
