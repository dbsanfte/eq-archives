I arrived at the post office one day just in time to see a young, 
probably around 18 or so, guy come bounding out of the post office and 
leap into some hot red car (looked like a porsche or something like it) 
that was taking up not one, but BOTH HANDICAPPED SPACES so his precious 
baby car wouldn't get scratched.  I tell you, I've never wished so hard 
for the ability to reverse time.  Although I would have had a hard time 
deciding on whether to call the cops, or key a few choice phrases into 
his paint job. ;p
