  Oh, I can communicate with him, just not very well.  We've been
married 17 years, you see and... wait, you're not a counselor,
are you?  Nevermind.  The thing is, I'm a better puller than
Lenny, when I play a class that can reasonably pull.  Lenny will
pull, but he considers it to be chore, not unlike doing dishes. 
I see it as a challenge, and joy.  This is the reason it took me
so long to make the decision to make my main a cleric... I was
not looking forward to giving up the fun of the pull.

  Problem is, I'd have to deal with Lenny then in RL.

/shrug.  I hear lots of things like this.  But the consensus
seems to be that charm has minimal effects for enchanters, and
presumably for cleric's lull line.  Still, I doubt that it could
hurt, and if it is true, every bit could help.

   I like James suggestion that I pull with my lowest nuke.  But
I also have questions about the summoning thing that was also
mentioned.  Say I do, oh, 20 points of damage.  I bring an Angry
Big Thing to Lenny.  He beats and taunts it off of me.  Then he
proceeds to pummel it senseless.  I heal Lenny (up to now, have
been pretty good at managing healing agro).  So it gets low on
health, remembers that 20 damage I did long ago, and invites me
over for a nice spot of tea?

Really?

Annie
