Aw, I don't bite. Not even when in wolf form :) I've even had lurkers
say hi to me twice - one was someone I was grouped with who suddenly
piped up that he read a.g.e; the other just wanted to bum a port :p

(Besides, I'd know who Halfpole was even if I didn't know your
character name. Been wondering who you are for some time now :) )
