    That's how everyone else seems to be reading it. Even if the spawn is
triggered in another zone (and the wording here suggests it isn't), what
exactly will stop someone from ganking it before the triggering cleric even
makes it to Skyfire? The one good feature here is the "no starting over"
part. But, really, this is how it looks right now:

    Six or seven spawns of Zord in Sol B per week. Clear FGs to get to him,
turn in pearl, you're done with Sol B.
    Two to three spawns of the killable Zord in Skyfire per week (same rate
of item entering game as now). No quest piece required, just off him for the
container. Need both container and pearl to get heart for final turn-ins.

    If the post by the Test cleric on EQClerics is true, that's been
confirmed to NOT be the case. And, well, think about Verant: do you really
think they'd up the rate at which new Sprinklers come into the world?
They've just made the final spawn like almost every other epic, is all -
first come, first serve.

    Here's hoping that it's even more restrictive: I want to see the box off
of Skyfire Zord be NO RENT and NO DROP, with the combined heart and pearl
being simply NO DROP. That would stop folks from farming Ragefire for the
box for a twink.

    Not quite: the Sol B part now happens six or seven times per week, so it
isn't much of a bottleneck. The real bottleneck is gacking Ragefire in
Skyfire.

    Again, assuming the combine heart isn't NO RENT. If it is, you have to
do this step AFTER the pearl is done.

    And this assumes he hasn't been upgraded. He's in the same zone as
Talendor now, not Nagafen. It would be reasonable to assume he's now as
tough as Talendor.

    I hope those other drops are gone. I really, really hope they're gone.

    What they fixed was a situation where a special rule had to be made
about who could jump a triggered spawn, and they removed an "oddball" camp
where people would stay for hours, even days, to get a mob only to watch it
pop in front of them and be taken. Now Rage is like every other contested
mob: first come, first serve. It's tough to complain about my epic being
made more like, say, the warrior epic and the race for Sev.

    If you are, the guides can deal with it quickly. "Who engaged first? The
kill was theirs to earn." It won't have the same emotion behind it as when
people would stay in the one place for two or three days solid, clearing the
fire giants ("doing all the work"), to see someone else mobilize faster than
them and take the spawn.

    I have one open question: what does this do to the servers that had
Ragefire lists?
