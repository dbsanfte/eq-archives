Iksar have nice natural AC, but they cannot wear most normal plate based
armors.  Iksars also have an XP penalty, meaning you may be frustrated when
you XP grind.  A nice thing about iksars is the natural regen, especially if
you are FD with a DoT on you.

/shrug, I think it is a matter of opinion  and how hard you are willing to
work.  Don't get me wrong, all SKs require a lot of hard work.  I play a
dark elf, and have to deal with the low str and sta everyday, heh.
