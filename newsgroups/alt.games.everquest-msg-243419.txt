I'm disappointed in my drogmors.  Got the 100k drogmor, but I need to
compare the speed to SoW and Bard speed, but it doesn't feel all that
fast.  Then I got a 30k drogmor and it was running the same speed as
Run 3.  =/
I remember when horses were first put out people were all cheering that
they got a 10k horse and I was out running them with just Run 3.
