The pro-choice position is not aided by ignorant social prejudice
that is no better than that of the fundamentalists.  If that is how
you view people who comprehend the value of concentrating on raising
their children and maintaining a household, then you have no
concept of how important that is (and have never computed what
those services are worth).

The fact is that there is no greater calling than that of 
molding, raising, and educating children.  They are the future.

The fact is that it takes a tremendous amount of talent and
effort to maintain and manage a household efficiently.

To argue a pro-choice position from this kind of bigotry
is worse than the pro-life arguments based on religious
fundamentalism.  At least religious fundamentalism contains
a self-consistent ethic, if not a self-constent reasoning.

Pro-choice positions based solely on political and social
agendas contain neither.
