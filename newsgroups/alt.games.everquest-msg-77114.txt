Hi
Before i start, this will not fix all the problems on everybodys computer, i
wish to offer some kind of help to people.

Many people have experienced really bad frames per second after the luclin
update, and after playing about with the DX8 core files, i noticed something
and posted it on a message board, now other people tried playing about with
it, and it seems there are really great effects comming from it.  My friend
with an K6-2 500Mhz, can now zone about 20 times faster than he could
before, and the cities no longer lag for him.  My load times are incredible
now on my 1.2ghz, and the frame rate in cities is so smooth............blah
blah blah

Ok first things first.  Open up the eqclient.ini file, it is inside your
everquest directory.  and add the lines in the [Defaults] section

UseUmbra=False
UseTnL=False
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16


Actually 32 bit colour is ok for me, but people are saying it gives a
massive improvement having all 3, good luck to you guys/gals, i hope this
helps.  I have only tried this in non-luclin areas, i do have luclin
installed though, and making this change in no way removes the new graphics.

Also if you dont like it then just set them back to normal, its probably
wise to make a backup of eqclient.ini before trying this.
