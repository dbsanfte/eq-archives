Not really sure ;) I play my druid when I want a break from "serious"
playing on my Warder, so I dont pay a huge amount of attention.
Running in terror from 5 cougars after meleeing 2 to death is kinda
fun and doesnt bother me.

I quad occasionally when I want to ding for new ports or to catch
a friends alt up, and I group very occasionally to help little
newbies out or to make sure I know how to play a druid in a group
situation , but... shrug

I play my recent snooglies hierophant in group occasionally while
they bodysnatch my ranger so we brush up our grouping skill sthat
way too. I've not heard any complaints so far. Its pretty similar
to rangering in terms of what the spells *do* so the only real
tricks are learning the cast times on the new heals and remembering
to med and cover aggro control from sitting down better.

Exodus kinda covers up any mistakes though ;)

... well, apart from accidentally exodus'ing I suppose ;) (But thats
where TRACK is on Suiddaru!) Not happened yet but I just bet it will :)


>Sceptre's a nice 1hb for a druid tho... beats my Springwood Club... but
>that's because it's +25mana and +10 AC extra ;o)

Yeah, I know, twinkee twinkee, but what am I gonna do? Anything I
could buy sells for 140k+ which I dont have and wouldnt want to put
the lootwhoring in to obtain, and anything less I wouldnt want....
(well, ok, maybe 50k+ but its still a lot of cash). I gave 14k to
a guildie recently who sold his horse to buy me a PSC when my moktor
BP got nerfed away as  I'd given my old armour away as well, but
thats about it.

I'm broke, my kit is fine, so when theres loot I either pass or
roll on druidy stuff for my little neko ;) Had a couple of visits
to Loremaster PizzaTalk in Chardok recently hoping for a nathsar
BP to complete her pretty purple lineup but the swine keeps just
dropping semi-uber weapons instead ;)

On that topic: Preserved Chodikai Vocal Cords (I think they were)
are fucking *awesome*. Right click voice graft for all pet classes.
Lots of fun ;)
