No these percents are Increased percents as of a certain patch... no
original numbers were discussed.  Please don't get them confused with
hard numbers because those are just a few zones that were modified at
that particular patch. They increased the ZEM there to hopefully lure
players to some under used zones.

As it stands... its a general rule of thumb.  Dungeon zones (usually
ones you cannot sow in) have a greater ZEM then outdoor zones.  Again
this is a "General" rule of thumb.  Then of course you have your PoP
zones which appear to have an even larger ZEM.
