 The importance of CHA for enchanters is still somewhat debated, but for the
most part it is not as nearly as important as you would think. It has a
marginal effect on duration of charms and such, but aside from that ultra
high CHA has no real noticable effects. Also, once CHA gets above 120 I
believe you will receive the maximum benefit from the stat as it affects
merchant prices.

You touch on it below, but the Breeze/Clarity line of spells do not increase
a caster's mana-pool. It just quickens the regen rate. An important
difference. I do agree with you about the amount of +INT items that are more
favorable than +CHA items, but I tend to look at it this way. The benefits
of high INT are clear, if I can help that stat along at the start, that
frees up the need to use +INT items in a slot if I can swap out say resist
gear at high levels. As an added bonus Enchanters get +CHA buffs. These go a
long way towards getting a decent CHA without the need to pile on items or
alter base stats.

I can only assume here that you are talking about soloing INT casters. In a
group it is quite possible for an Enc to burn all of his mana doing crowd
control and handling other ENC related tasks (Hasting tanks, etc). In
situations where a pull has gone bad, the bigger your mana pool the better.
That 1 or 2 extra casts might well be the difference between a thrilling
victory or an ignoble defeat.

My main is a 50 Enc right now and I have probably gated out of a fight less
than 5 times, this was never when I was low on mana and I usually only leave
when the tanks start to run. I would never group with a caster that did
that, especially one that is in such a critical position as an Enchanter...
