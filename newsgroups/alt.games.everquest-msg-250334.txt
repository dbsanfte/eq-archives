What is the real purpose of the penalty?  I love my Iksar Beastlord as I find 
the scaled wolf to be the coolest of all the beast pets.  He's almost lvl 41 
and doing an exp grinding session with him is like watching paint dry.  It's 
so slow it's ridiculous.  Is there a good reason why some races level so much 
slower than others and what's the point of having them level slower?
