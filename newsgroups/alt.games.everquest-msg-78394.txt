See these posts a lot.. in fact many start out that same way.. odd.

No they are a scam based on old ways of making money that are nerfed,
such as making toolboxes and other junk. You can make that much
basically though without a guide in the old mundane ways such as
buying low and selling high. One problem though now is that the new
"horse" economy has made it impossible for me at least to sell
anything, Even GOOD drops at CHEAP prices. Everyone is a huge tightwad
with their money and twinking seems to have died since they are all
saving for horsies and trying to sell stuff themselves at outrageous
prices to buy the best horse. It seems like I see the same people
trying to sell noct blades for 10 k for a week, get a clue.

The best dependable way I've found to make good money is to be a trade
item supplier and make leather padding for fine plate and cultural
plate smiths and sell the hq bear skins you get at the same time. The
hq bear skin might go for 30 plat or more while the leather padding is
like 80 - 100 plat a stack and can be made at level 5 or so quite
easily. This way to make money is really best started at 5 when the
things are XP also, but you could certainly do it at 45 quite fast
especially as a druid in say Mountains of rathe where you are not even
going to get attacked by the druids there while doing it (in fact if
they see a bear attacking you they may KS the bear from you)

www.eqtraders.com for some recipe details.

On a new char (ogre sk in fact) on a server i'd never been on I had it
merrily making these quite well with 45 leather paddings by level 7, a
whole set of leather storebought armor for itself and it regularly
bought out neriak vendors for more supplies to make the padding. You
can start nearly right away adding a couple points into tailoring and
maybe 5 into smithing ( to make the skinning knife, I failed about 4
times on that)

Every so often buying out bone chips at various newb vendors (up to
275 on one vendor is my record, great for twinking ;) ), such as the
gfay newb lift one, my 55 druid will still make quite a few leather
paddings out of the other stuff she buys out.

In fact if your druid really tried it could probably make 2 or 3 k a
week  or more just in porting people, it would just not be very fun
but none of those old ways of making 60 k a month were that fun
either. Making 100 plat an hour like you could supposedly on toolboxes
was not fun when it gave you carpal tunnel syndrome.
