Well, for a shammy, it would be a painful move to go there via Oasis !
I'd recommend to take the "non evil" route (the boat in Oasis does not
take you to Firona Vie but to the Overthere, the evil outpost).

Travel arrangements to Lake of Ill Omen for a non-evil char : 

- Take the boat in East Freeport
- Get off at Butcherblock Mountain and catch the barges on the dock
opposite of the Freeport dock's boat (they may take forever to come in
or just even to leave. Sit there and wait...).
- Get on the big boat the barges take you too.
- Get off the boat when he stops on the docks with that huge blue
flaming statue nearby. You can't miss it. This is Firona Vie.
- Ask your way to Lake of Ill Omen. Basically, you need to get out FV
and follow the beach toward a huge Iskar statue, then run up the
stream to zone into Lake of Ill Omen. But you'd be better off asking
around once there. Just don't forget camo and stay clear of the
statue.
