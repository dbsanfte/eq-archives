I can't reccomend SolA less.  I went there a couple of days ago after hitting
lvl 30 to try and get a quest item.  Of course, am now back down to 29 and am
without the item.  Maps of the area that I've seen aren't very helpful and it
is a confusing zone.  Very tough to do anything solo and I haven't been able to
find a group or partner yet.  I think I'm gonna give up and come back in a
couple more levels to try and get my quest item.
