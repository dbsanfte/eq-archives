You need to learn the limitations of your tools.  Hell, they don't even give 
you all the definitions of a word.  They give you the meanings that the 
dictionary chooses to recognize, and very limited information at that.  They 
rarely go into nuance or intonation.  Just because I have a jack hammer 
doesn't mean I'd use it to drive in nails.
