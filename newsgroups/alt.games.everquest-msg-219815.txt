Actually, in our case we're more likely to have 6 65 people than 20 55+
people.  In which case it doesn't count as a raid anymore...or does it?  
I'm not sure what the line between raid and power-group is.  I always felt
that a requirement for a "raid" was at least two groups, and we're
unlikely to have so many online at a time. 

But no, I'm not ruling anything out, never fear. :)
