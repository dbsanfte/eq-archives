What's the point in staying?  If the cleric thinks you are going to
lose, there's a pretty darn good chance you are going to lose.  He's
the one who knows how many heals he has left, and how quickly everyone
is going down.  If you succor, you lose aggro and have a chance to run
back quickly and give it another shot.  Sure, if you die you can get a
rez of some kind, but even with a cleric present that's a pain...
everyone running back from bind points etc etc.

I've been on the receiving end of this because both my wife and I have
druids.  I hold off until someone calls "evac" and I've sometimes
regretted it.  The problem is that once the main tank is down and you
are still fighting, everyone else usually falls like a deck of cards,
and the chance to evac is gone.
