    Our last attempt at the Emperor in Ssra went really well - got him to
60%, and had a bard in the main tank's group not accidentally hit DA song
(!) it would have been even better although not a victory in my opinion.
Afterwards, the people that got killed (I managed to Gate) were getting
corpses summoned. When the necromancer at zone summoned a corpse, I'd /ass
off him to target the body in the very-crowded hallway and res it. Well,
once I didn't re-target the necromancer and /assisted off the corpse....

    My target was the Emperor.

    I tried this off all the other bodies of people who had been slain by
the Emperor, and the same thing - I'd get the Emperor. Coming back to the
zone later I didn't get this result, but he does despawn so I'm not
surprised.

    So as a group project - next time someone dies, assist the corpse. Do
you target the mob that killed that person?

    James
