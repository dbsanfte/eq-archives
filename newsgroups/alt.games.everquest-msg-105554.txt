I play a level 52 druid and I can solo mobs in the Grey.  Easily.  I
can also quad kite wyverns pretty damned easily.  I've played ghetto
mezzer in the Maidens Eye and Fear on one particularly bad break.
Been a healer in ME, along with nuker and buffer.  And I regularly
supply ports for virtually all of my non-porting guildies.

But yeah, I can see how you say druids are a totally broken class.
