Given that you could level a naked Half Elf Druid to 60 as a one-trick
pony (root/rot doesn't take a very deep mana pool), without ever
learning alternative solo hunting strategies, let alone developing
good group skills, I can't imagine any serious argument being made
against that statement.  And I remain unable to comprehend how anybody
could seriously assert that Druids are hard to level (you don't know
if the horse is really dead until you've beaten it into paste).

Hmmm, I'm slightly confused here.  Were you aiming all these comments
at me or Dilly?  I've certainly given fairly free rein to my inner jerk
in this thread, but my chars are decidedly non-uber and I take care not
to behave as a jerk in-game (EQ isn't usenet after all).  And I thought
I was poking at the thin-skinned, not being so myself.  Oh well.
