I have`nt had to ask for anything as yet although I have had a lot
of spells particularly SoW caste on my druid by passing characters.
Once got myself killed at lvl3 in the Butcherblock Mountains and had 
to trek all the way from Kelethin to loot my corpse.
What I want to say though is if anyone does a bind for me all they 
are going to get is profuse thanks!, at lvl 5 I do`nt have 2pp and if
I did I would have better things to do than spend it on a bind :-)))

That is good, I had a lot of buffing from a passing higher druid when
I was set upon by two Orc cents. He just sat there meditating and 
buffing me while I whacked the hell out of them!

I had been about ten minutes wandering around my first time in the game
when someone came up to give me stuff.  I stood there like a stuffed 
cabbage, had`nt a clue what was going on!. He had to lead me by the
had through using the trade window and putting the stuff on even.
Not sure now if I ever said thank you even........
So I guess it does happen!.

I about to try Butcher Block again at lvl 6 and hope it will go
better this time.
