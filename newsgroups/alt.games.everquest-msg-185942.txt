I get the feeling that I have absolutely no choice about what I am going to
do with my life, and that I never did, and i'm going to do it for the
"wrong" reasons, and that is perfectly normal and natural for a guy to do
that and that no man really has any choice in anything, so I might as well
do what I am capable of even if I end up in a lake of fire as a result,
although I hope that a lake of fire isn't that bad.

All I've ever really wanted is a girl friend, why does that have to be such
a big deal. I hear a voice saying that I am too special to attract anyone,
only the very best and that is ridiculously expensive. Maybe after another
10 years? Yeah, basically my current plans would take about 10 years to
complete at which time I might run the world which has always been my goal,
but I don't think that I am the antichrist or the false prophet, I am the
Christ-inspired prophet that will come in the future, apparently when that
occurs I will finally get what I want and I wont spend a day in Hell as a
result because I saw what I wanted and I went for it and never gave up,
although I probably made a mistake or two in the process, but that is life.
