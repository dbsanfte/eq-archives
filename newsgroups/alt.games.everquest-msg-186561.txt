Did I say Capital gains tax?  Income tax from people with jobs created
during Clinton term in office, as opposed to all those  who have lost
their jobs under Bush's failed trickle down ideas.

You don't understand the difference between missile strikes and

Why? because they could, any nation can keep its thinktanks going
despite treaty. The US makes war plans all the time to invade allies
even though we never expect to. They took our brides and did think
tank work but no actual construction. Until Bush took over and
threatened them.

Since its on now and we know your logic is backwards. It was off till
we threatened them and then they gave two shits what we thought.

There's a difference between allies and enemies. Under Clinton the US
had Allies like russia, france, britain and germany. We also had
enemies, the have nots and dictators. Now under Bush we still have all
the old have not enemies but we also have managed to piss of most of
our allies with out bullying cowboy presidents unilateral approach.

The have nots hate us no matter what, now that Bush is president his
gung ho style is getting our allies to dislike us too.

There's the attitude that pisses people off worldwide, that smug "we
know everything and you better do what we say" attitude. The amount of
money france or germany might have got from selling stuff to iraq is
minuscule compared to their GDP's. And it's not like the US has never
sold weapons to dictators. How about having some respect for our
allies even if they have the courage to disagree with us. That's what
friends are for to tell you when your acting like an idiot in public.
I guess the Billions of people living in France, germany, China,
pakistan, Russia, etc who disagree with the US push are all retards
right who can't see the situation in the correct light? Have some
"Freedom" fries with that PC, elitist BS.

Budget surpluses, no major wars, security and faith in the country, an
attempt at a national health plan. Lets contrast this to Bush's tax
cuts during economic downturns which tend to favor the super rich.
Yeah that's gonna help joe middle class feel safe and secure. 

>Was it the Republican-supported, Democrat-opposed NAFTA?

Could have been, I'm not arguing that republicans don't have some good
ideas I'm saying Bush is a retarded puppet who has cost us immense
respect worldwide and whose economic policies reek of both favoritism
and lack of common fiscal sense. 

>Was it the Republican policy of deregulation?

Deregulation can be a good thing or not depending on what is
deregulated. Deregulated industries frequently have major bankruptcies
causing loss of many many jobs. 

>Perhaps it was the Republican welfare reform bill?

Nope definitely not. Considering that minimum wage full time provides
near the same money as welfare without any medical benefits, etc
cutting welfare time without offering any means to improve the poors
opportunities is just a way of abandoning them and transferring their
problems to the private sector.  In other words another tax.

>Maybe it was those spending cuts that Clinton fought against?

Yet strangely he had balanced budgets and surpluses.
