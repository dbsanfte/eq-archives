Hey there,

First thing I would do, is goto eqatlas.com. Print off the Padual Caverns
map. Its pretty easy once you make the trip a few times, but can be very
daunting at first.

Then, when looking at the map, the south end is generally good for 8-12.
Hunt bugs and shrooms. The fungus aliens are a little higher and tougher.
The north east end is good 12-16. Again bugs and shrooms. The aliens are
again a little tougher. Once you hit 16 start making your way to the middle
connecting caves to the north. Fight Bugs, shrooms and shiknars. this should
be good 16-20 maybe even 21 or 22.

After all that the Recondites near the Shadow Haven zone are sweet 22-26.
There are two camps, closest to the zone and at the north end of the shore.
Take em in a small group and you'll be fine.

General advice.
Invis or sneak/hide is your friend. The fungus aliens (patog fiends) will
gang up on you like mad.

Announce your trains when fleeing, especially if fleeing to Hollowshade moor
(north zone) or Shadeweavers Thicket (south Zone) there are usually lowbies
near each, and it is bad to die from unannounced train.

Other than that make sure to keep your skills up, P caverns has a dungeon
bonus and a under 30 dungeon bonus. Its easy to fall behind and out level
your fighting abilities.

Good Hunting
