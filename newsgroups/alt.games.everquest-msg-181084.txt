This is really in response to everyone who disagreed with Pulp (which is
most everyone, I think).  What is missed isn't the scammin or the spam, but
instead the interaction.  Now, when you want to buy something  you can
either look for it on auction, or run up to the Bazaar (assuming you have
Luclin) and wade through the lag looking for an item.  On some servers, this
is great.  On the older servers, items are so marked up because of the
amount of plat that is flowing around it's hard to actually find that sought
after item at a reasonable cost.

I happen to like the Bazaar.  It's a nice place to send everyone who likes
to spam auction, but it might be nice to get a group of people together and
start an open air market in EC or Gfay one or two days a week.  Just to see
how people respond to live ineraction.
