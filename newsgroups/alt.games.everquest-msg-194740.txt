I think each level is the previous one x2, but I could be wrong or bitter 
;)

That depends on the class. When I hit 51 I instantly went to 100% AA. I am 
a monk, so Run 3 was a no-brainer for me. After I got run3, I went back to 
normal leveling until I can solo for AA (prolly around 60 I will start that 
during off-peak times). Generally, though, most agree it is better to wait 
until you have a high level, as the AA bar fills at the same rate that 50-
>51 exp fills (IIRC 50-51) and a 65 can get through level 50 much better 
than a 50 can ;)
