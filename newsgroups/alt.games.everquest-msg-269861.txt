Yeah but but about half of those are now EBayed,  its not like they
know much :)

I NEVER understood this attitude?? How are those books stopping YOU
from exploring? If you are using the books, then you have only
YOURSELF to blame for exploring being ruined!!

Besides some folks are explorers and some folks leave the exploring to
others and just get directions to new places from those explorers.

Another point would be... How many times can you EXPLORE a zone before
it can't be called exploring anymore?

I have been with the came almost from the very start... 4/99, started
2 weeks after it went live. I have EXPLORED most of the zones in the
game. There are still a few I haven't been to either because I wasn't
flagged or keyed but I am fine with that.
I have explored just about EVERY square inch of Antonica, Faydwer and
Odus many times over, so when I  travel through those areas I would
prefer to take a shortcut to my destination whenever possible.

Was never a 55 as max :)

Why does that matter??  Or rather why should you care about that??
Well I can  kind of understand that, my mage was 47 when level cap was
raised from 50 to 60 and I was kind of irritated about that, but I got
over it and moved on
LOL.. when OoW came out and level went to 70, I had my mage and my bst
maxed out in level 65 so one kill levelled them both to 66 but after
that I slowed down. My mage is still  66 at the moment but worked on
my Bst and he is 68 right now, he would most likely be 70 but I went
to work on  AA's kind of heavily and was doing a lot of raiding :)

>I finished playing with 46 level character and waited for EQ2.
>Now I am enjoying it.

Although from what  I have seen of screen shots and heard about from
others in regards to EQ2, I doubt seriously I will ever play it.
I have to much time invested in EQ1 and I don't have the time and/or
money to play both games. Besides I have heard and read a few things
about EQ 2 that I definately don't like.
