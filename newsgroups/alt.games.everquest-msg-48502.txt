well, the ole joke is Lake of ill manners... and I must agree with
this statement.... but I have been hunting in the Dread Lands and have
found the Dreadlands to be just the opposite.
	The groups I have been in have been entertaining, and very
group oriented.  Maybe its just that I am comming into the Higher end
of the game.. (all if not most players in zone are above 37).
	I have met some quite charming players, and have even revamped
my friends list to add some new traveling buddies.

	not a whole bunch to say... but THANKS TO ALL IN THE
DREADLANDS!!!
