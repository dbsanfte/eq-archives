I think you know I meant '80.

Possibly.

Actually, his cutting taxes made things real rough in those first two years.
After all, he was basically changing the nature of the economy.  Things that
were done in the public sector had to be handled in the private sector, but
by cutting taxes, he made it possible for that to be done.

On the other hand, by '83, things were better than they were in '79.
Inflation was down, unemployement was down, real wages were up.  We make the
mistake, I think, in trying to compare that time to now.  Of course, things
weren't as good back then; we have had almost ten years of growth since
then, mostly based on his putting money back into the economy where I has a
chance to grow.  Compare '83 to '79, and you get a more accurate picture.
He was re-elected by a landslide in '84 based on the simple question: "Are
you better off than you were four years ago?"
