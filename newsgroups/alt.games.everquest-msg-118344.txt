It is sanctimonious shit, and you are one of the
prime purveyors of it.

Yesterday, you urged someone to step in front of a
train, and now have the gall to claim some moral
high ground, because you adhere to a EULA that not
even the makers of the game want to enforce.

You ought to stop taking the game, and more
importantly, yourself, so seriously.

Find yourself a friend that isn't inflatable.
