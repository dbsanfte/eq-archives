nope, nowhere near uber (as far as gear goes)  just a group of good friends.
level wise we were - 60 monk, 60 rogue, 59 cleric, 59 druid, 59 chanter, 57
druid.
HS mobs have few HP (which is made up for by their HT)

were gonna do HS tonight, its been a while and i love the zone.. gonna be
real fun this time.  im either gonna be playing monk (puller and MA) and the
cleric, or monk (MA and puller) and the evacer.  If i play the puller and
evacer, then the rogue will play him and his cleric (confusing hey)

we did VS over christmas, at like 5am est.. it was funny, cuz we only had
12ish people there anyway, and at least half of us were running 2 chars....
5 people LD and maybe 2 people would still be left in lol

helped in pof a few days ago, just me and the one guy above contributed
monk,rogue,wiz and cleric (we both have a cleric) got exp on something silly
like 98% of mobs in there, including exp on every demi heh :)
