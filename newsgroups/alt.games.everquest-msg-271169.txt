I should have expected this, shouldn't I? :D
I really don't care that much about this indicator. I ran around in EQ
with just the printed maps from eq atlas. And I liked it alot.

Nowadays I open the ingame map and just run. It's way simpler. But I like
the paper maps more and still use them from time to time. :)
