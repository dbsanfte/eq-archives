Thread drift, OT:

In the Lancaster PA area, the Girl Scouts changed the name of one of 
their cookie types, from Samoans to Carmel Delights.

For unrelated reasons, we were looking at the local census information 
when my wife said "hey, we have four Carmel Delights in town!"

Maybe you had to be there, but we're still laughing about it four months 
later.

Oddly, in Texas they're still marketed as Samoans

There are several guilds operating from the pacific, I used to play in a 
small guild which had a partner which was entirely Korean.  Coordinating 
raid activities was particularly difficult, compared even to European 
guilds, because we really didn't share anything even resembling a common 
language, watching their chat looked like

no go ra no si go ra

Honestly, a -lot- like that.  Fortunately, common EQ terms were used by 
default, so while we couldn't chat very well, we could get accross ideas 
like MT and Cheal Chain and so on.
