This stems from a guild discussion. What is the lowest level you know of
for a character to have completed their Epic. It would be extremely
funny to have a low level running around with one. I saw another post
here many months back about the newbie quests and set out to try and
match the feat. I managed to finish off the Felwithe newbie Cleric quest
without the alt actually ever killing anything. The only experience the
alt got was on the turn ins for the weapon and the starting note. I know
this wouldn't be possible for an Epic, but would like to see a
discussion from people who have been there to see their opinions on the
minimum possible level to obtain one.
