: yes, when it's only being split 2 ways, 60/40, it's pretty decent...but when
: split 4, 5 or 6 ways, it's significantly lower exp for the level 40 player.

Lets do some math:
(And lets do it 5 ways cause we all know the 6th one is free)

A group:

Group A) 60, 50, 50, 50, 40

60 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 = 250

Lets say the group kills a lvl 50 mob yeilding 25,000 experience points.
Divided thusly:

25,000/250 = 100

And distributed thusly,

L60 gets 100 * 60 = 6,000
L50's get 100 * 50 = 5,000
L40 get 100 * 40 = 4,000

You consider the experience needed for a level 40 to get to 41 is much
less that it is for a 50 to get to 51, the level 40 is getting a very
good deal, particularly considering that the same 50 lvl mob will be out
of reach for a group of lvl 40's. The level 50's would get the same
experience as if they were all 50's.
