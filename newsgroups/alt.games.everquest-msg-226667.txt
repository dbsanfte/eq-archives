Couldn't agree more, and you usually *are* out of luck if you're not a 
natively snaring class. My warrior had that sword (starts with a "k", 
damned if I can think of it offhand) that drops in city of mist with a 
proc necro snare effect. It's a nice little toy to be sure, and the 
snare added a bit of aggro back in the day. But if you ever counted on 
it working when you absolutely needed it to (e.g. mob about to run in a 
crowded dungeon) it never would and you were screwed.
