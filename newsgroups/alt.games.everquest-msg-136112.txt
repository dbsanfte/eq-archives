Then " inherited" was a poor choice of words

That is their problem. I have an Irish friend ( an american citizen now) who
refers to the British as "those murdering beast" and I know an Indian from
India who refers to the British as " Butchers." Now it has been a long time
since the British Empire existed and it left many good things as a legacy to
its colonies - to quote Nelson Mandela " We looked to London  - all good
things came from there". My point being, I cannot control the feelings of
others and have no intention of hitching myself to them and taking that
roller coaster ride - so if they are pissed they are pissed and that is
their problem. And if they get pissed and fly planes into buildings they are
hunted down and killed or imprisoned so they cannot do it again. As Charles
says " Fuck with the bull and do not be surprised when you get the horns."

And many, because they cannot achieve as much and never will, are simply
jealous.
