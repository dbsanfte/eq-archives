 It would seem to me the only way to be actually fair to the clerics 
would be to change that to:

" All party members who turn up without peridots get take a walk or deal 
with receiving Pinzarn (or better, NOTHING)."

 I mean, if you played this way, the cost would be shared evenly, and 
the cleric could just get 1/6th (or whatever) of the loot. 

 While your setup for allowing the Cleric extra loot actually sounds 
fair and good, somehow the overall tone still seems... I dunno, to make 
it seem like the cost problem is all the clerics fault somehow. 

 For example:

 Which drops the whole burden on the cleric again. It's find and dandy 
if they get in your group, AND if there's enough extra loot, AND if that 
extra loot actually covers their expense. 

 Again, I'd change it just a bit to be:

"Anyone who feels it is ok to allow a 25% drop in performance in the 
group by not paying for their own (or the puller's and Enchanters) 
peridots just so they can save a few plat can take a running jump."

 I fail to see why this wouldn't be both more reasonable and fair.
