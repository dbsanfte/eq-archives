  First off, all RADEON graphics cards have hardware T&L, just as all
GeForces do.  They are the only two chipset "families" that support hardware
T&L to my knowledge.  Earlier NVIDIA and ATI chispets (TNT, TNT2, Rage,
ect.) don't have T&L.

  As for what card I was suggesting for $100, I believe you can find a 64 mb
GeForce2 MX400 for that price, or, even better, a GeForce2 GTS.  Or even
better, with some shopping around (pricewatch.com, ect.) you might be able
to get a GeForce2 Pro.

  How much T&L matters for performance is difficult to gauge... for some
games and benchmarks you will notice hardly any difference if they benchmark
or game is not written to take advantage of hardware T&L.  Since Verant is
recommending their users have video cards with hardware T&L, my guess would
be that their new engine is definitely written to take advantage of it.

  Since you have both a GeForce2 and a Rage Fury at your disposal, though,
do some testing and let everyone know what your results are like.  I am just
speculating based on things I have read on hardware review web sites and
Verant's system requirements page.  :)
