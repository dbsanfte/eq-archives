No, a raid can occur anywhere. Though raid worthy targets only occur
in predefined places.

However that being said, occasionally you'll get a bunch of lowbies to
raid one of the lower level dungeons. Can be a lot of fun, when you
have like 30 or 40, 10th level characters raiding Blackburrow or
Crushbone.
