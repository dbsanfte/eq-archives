My great great grandfather had his leg amputated with a goddamn rusty saw!
Fuck all these BABIES nowadays that expect "sterile equipment" and goddman
painkillers!!  If he didn't get it why the fuck should you!!??
/sarcasm off
To echo the sentiments of some others here, it's a VIDEO GAME.  Big deal,
you've got a shload of free time and patience so you made 60.  If you're
feeling that your "hard work" is rendered pointless because someone can do
it easier, then go see a therapist.  Get over yourself, it is NOT that big a
deal.  Getting rid of the spell book and spreading out the hell level xp
isn't going to make 60 any easier anyway.  And even if it does, who the hell
cares?  I for one am secure enough to enjoy my own acclompishments
regardless of how easy it is for someone else to do the same.    My pride
isn't based on being better than others, or having a harder time.
ESPECIALLY not in a VIDEO GAME.  I for one hope all the elitists quit over
this, if there's one thing about EQ that drives me bananas it's people that
think hitting 60 is like winning the goddamn nobel prize.
I'd like to see a new "hardcore" server, where all you powergamers can move
to for free.  No changes, and nobody under level 54 allowed.  And then only
if they've played since beta.  You all can do raids against computer
controlled dragons all by yourselves, and spend all day complimenting each
toher on how hardcore you are.  Maybe add a special GM to constantly remind
you all that you are THE BEST DAMN EVERQUSET PLAYERS IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!
