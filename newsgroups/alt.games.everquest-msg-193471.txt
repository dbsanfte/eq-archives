I do hope this is the case, I shall be trying it again.
I have had exactly the same experience with stringed skill in the bazaar.
Also swimming and Tarews took the longest time to get a minor skill up. I
only got the swimming skill ups when actually moving. Left in a corner,
playing Tarews did have some effect, but again, an Overnight stint left me
waaay below max. (I know, this contradicts some aspects of the previous
post - I didn't DROWN after all)

Perhaps I am just an unlucky, dumb (Kitty = Low Int) bard?

I will be trying out some further tests to prove my point. I hope I am
wrong! If i can post any corroboprative evidence, you'll be hearing from me.

Wayil <--- off to music practice... again
