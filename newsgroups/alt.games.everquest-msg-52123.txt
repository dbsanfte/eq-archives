That's what I keep telling my wife.  She loves to work in the yard, and
I hate it.  Outdoors is no good unless my son wants to play, but he
goes to bed at 8:15 anyways.  TV holds zero interest for me these
days, except for a few quality programs like "The Man Show" on
Comedy Central.

Might as well play EQ.
