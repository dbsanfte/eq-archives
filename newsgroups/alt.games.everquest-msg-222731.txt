Yep, we use the roll once, establish order, pick your item, for the same 
reason.

The person who rolls highest gets to pick exactly what they wanted 
without having to work out what to pass on.

People are more likely to take useful stuff, rather than just pass on it 
in the hope of getting the 'best item'.

It's quick, efficient, and transparent - we use it all the time.
