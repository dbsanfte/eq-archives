Well, I am some Johnny-Come-Lately, but I wasn't attempting to repeat what's
already been done. It's simply an effort to help people. Mainly, people who
have come to this group before finding any other information about the game.

I did ask before I compiled it, if there was a newsgroup FAQ, and I was told
there wasn't one. Discussion about it went on for quite some time before the
first draft, and even longer before the final version made it to the
newsgroup.

I don't have access to r.g.c.e., which may explain why I didn't know about a
FAQ there. Even so, I don't see why it should rule out having one for this
group.
