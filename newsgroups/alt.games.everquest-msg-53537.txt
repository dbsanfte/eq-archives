 Yep... I do this all the time, hehe. Handed out a lot of blades from
Kael to the orcs in GFay a while back (like 25 of them). The noobs
started yelling "OMG!!! The Orcs are dropping UBER swords!! There's
something wrong!! Everyone hurry and get a few before they shut the 
zone down!!" A GM even showed up, hehe.
