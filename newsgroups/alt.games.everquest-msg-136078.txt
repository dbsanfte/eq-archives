Attribute:  left-handedness
Behaviour:  Writing with the left hand.

Attribute:  Gay
Behaviour:  Being attracted to members of the same sex.

Yes, there's a distinction between te two, but I hardly see why you think 
it's inportant for thepurposes of this discussion.

}> A behavior is an action which you either choose to
}> do, or which your nervous system engaged in by instinct.
}In which case you need your brain to accomplish. If you were DEAD,
}you'd still be thin/tall/curley/braces, right ??  If you were DEAD,
}would you still be "gay" ??  Think about it.

I vote yes.  You live on in the memory of your friends and family.

On the other hand, in a few months/years, you will be much, much thinner, 
and probably bald.  You might still have braces though.

}Gay is a "behavior", NOT an attribute.  You did a nice job explaining
}"behaviours" in the paragraph above here, but its noteworthy how
}you were able to cite "two" kinds of behaviours (which is good),
}concious, and instinct, but yet omit "gay" which also happens to
}be argued by two other schools of thoughts (or behavior), thoes
}who thing its "born with", vs. "learned" (the "concious" & "instinct").

It's an attribute that leads to certain behaviours.  I hardly see why you 
think that's important, though.  Nor do I see why you think it's important 
if it was nature or nurture.  Either way, the person's gay, they're 
perfecty happy being gay (for the most part), and they have no reason to 
change it just to please you.

}GeezeSUS! - stabilize thy thought process framework will ya!  You're all

}bad you're not a coder - it be easier to explain it with a Java stub.

Actions are generally the observable effect of behaviours, which are, in 
turn, determined by attributes.

}True. (that statement alone, that is)

I'm not.

}> WE need to accept that people are different 
}"different" = varying "behaviour" OR "attributes" OR "actions" !!!

Or, just possibly, all three...

Yes, that sounds about right.  Differences can result from, or cause, all 
three of the other categories.

}> Totally agree.  However, I would also like to know that Joe hasn't told

}Then Joe is "smart", and therefore affords standard acceptance/respect
}by, and "of" thoes in the standard bell curve.

}> concerning the actions which others would take against him.
}That has no value.  I'd like to know that the reason Joe hasn't told
}anyone (in his school yard setting) is because it doesn't FIT in such
}setting !!!!!  Further, sounds like ole Joe has the smarts to know about
}how society is, and social norms, and bell curves (and Darwin) etc.

By requiring Joe to be "smart" in this way, you are discriminating against 
him.  Don't ask, don't tell is all well and good until you'd just like to 
hold your lover's hand, and have to worry about what gender they are.  How 
would you feel if you could't hold your lover's hand in a pblic place 
without having to worry about being perceived as 'abnormal' somehow, and 
possibly discriminated against?  

}> I know--- its that whole warm and fuzzy thing again.  Too much time watching
}> Star Trek and all its utopian ideals while I was growing up.
}The point being is, you want to not only IGNORE the laws of nature,
}but because said gay person doesn't fit under the giant bell jar
}overtop the humans known as the bell curve, you want to just pick
}up the jar and move it over Joes way and set it back down and say:
}THERE! - Joe is NOW under the social norm bell curve.  Won't happen.

Have you ever really looked at a bell curve?  It's high in the middle, 
then it goes down to either side, and approaches the x axis, where it 
spreads out.  What you're saying here is, just because someone is under 
the little narrow bit at the ends of the curve, they are somehow not under 
the curve, which is patently false.  The whole point of the curve is that 
-everything- is under it, just more of it is toward the center.

}And speaking of ole man Darwin, gays can't reproduce, and thus
}don't fundamentally "fit" into the whole evolution thing anyways...

Questionable.  Homosexual behaviour tends to appear in any animal 
population that expands to fill its niche, or experiences overcrowding, 
much as humans are rapidly doing.  It doesn't just happen in humans, you 
know.

Now, could it be that there is an evolutionary advantage to the whole 
species in having some fraction of its membership not preoccupied with 
reproduction-oriented mating?

Since you're sure to ask for references, I'd recommend going to a search 
engine and typing in 'homosexuality' and 'animals'.  There was an 
interesting page at:

http://blue.butler.edu/~bwoodruf/alliance/misc/homosexanimals.htm

}Not being insensitive here, just pointing out that it's an "aboration"
}not a norm. (if that even matters here).

'Aberration' tends to be a very loaded term.  No, 90% of the population 
is not gay.  But aberrance includes a notion that not being in the 
majority makes you somehow bad.  This may interfere strongly with your 
claims of not being bigoted.

}But in closing, so think
}about the difference between behaviour and attribute.  And to address
}an eariler statement you made (in another post maybe), you said being
}gay DEFINES someone, or defines their personality or some such shit....
}So, to that, if a gay guy gets his nuts blown off in a war, guess what?
}according to you, hes got no more personaility.

Not at all, you've read it almost exactly backward.  If he had no nuts, 
he'd still be gay.  That's rather the point.  Nor does it define the 
entire personality, but it does have a very pervasive influence  on the 
personality, that varies widely from individual to individual.

Oh, and as for the genetic-or-not issue, here's the evidence I found for 
the pro-genetic side:

First, what I was remembeing was a book called The Science of Desire 
(Hamer & Copeland, 1994), which included a paper in the back reprinted 
from Science, which is a reputable, refereed journal.  That's the basis of 
my claim that it's objective.  There's some summaries of what's said there 
at the following links.
