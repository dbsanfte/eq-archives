Running around with an unsnared mob in an effort to mez it seems kind of
futile.  ST has a recast time, so your options as I see them are: 1. Move
out of range of others and root it.  I don't often have a spot for root, so
I rarely have it up. 2. Take the beating until ST refreshes and mez it.
This depends on your gear and the difficulty of the mobs.  I'm not sure how
hard mobs of LDoN's at this level hit, so this may or may not be an option.
At 65 in an regular, if I get a mez resist I'll just recast (I however have
a goodly amount of hp and am using a mez with no refresh time).  3. FD off
the aggro and let the mob smack someone else a time or two while you get it
mezed.

In this scenario, I would probably go with option number 3.  If you are in
charge of CC then your group members ought to trust you to get a mob under
control as best you can.  If you fd and then try to mez an add you don't
have to wprry about trying to channel your mez, so long as one of the druids
isn't going to freak out from taing a hit or two and start running around,
you'll all be ok.

Running around is generally frowned upon.  Aggro kiting is definitely a
viable technique for solo killing, and it has possibilities as a cc
technique, but when it comes down to it - aggro kiting in a dungeon isn't
socially acceptable.  In a pick up group aggro kiting for CC is more likely
to scare your groupmates and make them think you are in need of assistance,
than help your group.  If you are going to kite, let your group mates know
before hand and it probably wouldn't hurt to make a hotkey to remind them
that you don't need any help.

Get used to people thinking you are some kind of wimpy caster like the other
int classes.  I would say my getting healed when I don't need it vs my
getting healed when I do need it ratio is around 40:1.  Healers want
everyone but the MA's health bar to stay in the 90 - 100% range all the
time.  If you start to drop below this range, then they become concerned and
feel the need to heal you right away.  Sadly, there really is no solution
other than grouping with the same healers until over time they will learn
when you need a heal and when you don't.  In one particularly bad BoT group,
my entire group save me died when fighting the named bee in Lightening.
Chaining lifetaps and tanking I finished off the shaman slowed bee from 50%
and a hasted former DC pet.  You can take care of yourself if you keep your
wits about you when things get out of hand, but many other players and
classes aren't used to his level of self reliance and will feel the need to
sacrifice themselves to "save" you.  Ultimately, if you want people to think
you are a good grouping necromancer you have to conform.  No tanking mobs,
even though you can.   No kiting in dungeons, unless you don't have any
other options.  Cast MW a lot, people will think you are amazing.
