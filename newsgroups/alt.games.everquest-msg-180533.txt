Well, actually pelts sell for good money in the bazaar.  My ranger was my first
character, level 52 now.  Completely untwinked.  I often donated for a sow in
the olden days and spent *weeks* out hunting for pelts.  I loved it myself. 
Still do.  And you *do* get to *fight*, something a druid just can't do.
My druid is level 40.  You'll certainly have more options, groups and make more
money as a druid.  And you can certainly solo.  And heal much better than a
ranger.   But you'll NEVER do melee damage or use a bow.  And their tracking
ability just plain sucks in comparison to a ranger.  
Good luck whatever you decide....
