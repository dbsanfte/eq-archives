   I see this as being pretty close to done now.  If you have any objections, or
seen any spelling or grammatical problems, now would be a good time to say.

    I am still willing to make changes and add stuff, of course.  However, I
don't want to see the size increase too much more.   Still looking for more
serverwide chat channels to add, though.
