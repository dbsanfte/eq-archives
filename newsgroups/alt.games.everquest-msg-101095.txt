Well just to correct your ignorance, magicians can also debuff on a similar
line of spells to what your group shaman is casting.

Thats in addition to being the second most powerful nuker, having a
unresistable damageshield + fire resist buff in 1, AE rain spells, point
blank AE spells, dispell, they can summon focus items for the rest of the
group (increased spell damage, shorter casting times etc), weapons, armour,
100% weight loss bags, mana conversion to other players (mod rods),
levitation rings, enduring breath stones (which you can cast when you need
them, unlike the equivalent spells which are active from the moment they are
cast)

Oh and one of their 'blow-up dolls' as you so nicely put it, will quite
happily kick the living shit out of you

They are also doing a great deal more damage in a fight then you are, so how
do you quantify "not doing a lot"?

Really, I'd have never of guessed your level!

When you leave the noob zones you will start to realise a shamans mana is as
critical, if not more-so, then a clerics mana.  Slowing the mob means a LOT
less mana consumption on the clerics part, which gives the group more
options...  faster pulls because the cleric needs to med less, tougher
(named) mobs which would normally hurt too much (giving a chance for nicer
loot), or the cleric the capability to cast different spells, e.g. mark of
karn (strips mobs damage shield, and heal everybody from hitting the mob),
mark of retribution (a reverse damage shield, you cast it on the mob and
every time it hits somebody the mob takes 15 damage) both stackable with
druid/magician damage shields.. clerics can also nuke for close to 1000 now.

There are a number of faults with the mage class (mainly that they have no
real form of defence or attack if caught off guard - read, no pet at the
time, and some places pets are unusable... poh 2nd floor, DN) but your
baseless blabbing was totally off mark.
