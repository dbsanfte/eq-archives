I always figured that anyone desperate enough for cash to be sowing
for donations really needs the plat. It can't see where you could
possibly make much going that route. Someone offering low lvl buffs
for donations is about the only thing that will motivate me to  dig
through my bank spaces to see if I have any items to give away. 
... that and grouping with a low lvl that isn't twinked.
