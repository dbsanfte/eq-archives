The first dungeon group I was in the leader was very specific:
1. Do not touch the zone line until we all get buffed
2. Do not touch any boxes - we'll do them after we complete the mission if
there is time.
3. Do not loot.
4. Stay together / no wandering off
5. If you don't have 90 minutes to play please say so now. If you need a bio
break please do so now.

I'm not saying it'll help, but it can't hurt to state the obvious right up
front.
