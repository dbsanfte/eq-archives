I too have often wished there could be a direct port of DirectX to other
platforms (particularly linux and mac, since they comprise the rest of the
home desktop market.)  I'm going off of memory here...which means I'm
probably wrong.  But, so much of DirectX is built upon COM (component object
model.)  COM is an open standard microsoft created, and i *think* microsoft
has licensed COM in such away that anyone else can implement it for other
platforms.  DirectX isn't open, but COM is, and DirectX heavily uses COM.
Anyone see where I'm going with this?

However, one fact that hasn't been mentioned about DirectX yet is that it
requires special drivers from the hardware manufacturer.  The same is true
with OpenGL....need special drivers.

If another media API came along which required new drivers...how willing
would the hardware manufacturers be?  That's the big question.  Hell, look
at a company like ATI.  They have enough problems getting Direct3D drivers
to be fast enough, to say nothing of their OpenGL drivers.  If a whole new
kernel media API came along for linux, how likely would ATI or another of
the non-nVidia companies be to spend the money to hire new employees to
learn the API and write drivers for it?  Considering linux right now has a
reputation for being a network server OS and not a PC desktop OS.  In truth,
if these hardware companies would just publish the techincal specifications
of how their cards worked...other people in the public domain would write
drivers for it.  BUT, companies are too dumb to do that.  So, we the
consumers get screwed.
