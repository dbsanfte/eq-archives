Same thing I was thinking. I wish people (especially Bards) wouldn't kite in
certain zones (and OOT is one of them). Once when I was in Oasis, back when
I was running a Necromancer, a Bard (lvl 45 or 46, don't remember which)
decided to kite the Spectres there, and accidentally pulled more than he
could handle. He ended up getting half the zone killed, including himself
(and me).

(He DID give warning he was going to do it, but he fled toward North Ro,
with no train warning, instead of heading toward South Ro like most people
do when they try to fight a Spectre or SG and can't handle it)

I've been killed because of  kiters who couldn't handle their mobs on at
least half a dozen occasions, and only once was the kiter a class other than
a Bard.

As a result, if I'm in a zone soloing, and a Bard announces he's
multi-kiting something, or I see him multi-kiting, there's a good chance
I'll Gate out, unless I'm doing a quest or camping for a specific drop.

(Bards are probably my favorite class to group with, after Druids, but I
absolutely HATE solo Bards who try to kite more than one mob at a time)

My biggest problem with Bards multi-kiting (well, kiting in general, really)
is that it takes longer for them to kill mobs while doing this than it does
a Druid or Wizard, and they don't have the ability to Gate when something
goes wrong, instead of putting others at risk when they flee.

As for OOT....that is a zone where kiting should not be allowed, because its
hard to get out of the way if something goes wrong. Especially if you're a
non-caster or can't cast Gate for other reasons.
