I would agree with this.

I would also agree with this.  Nice summation.  :-]

I was referring to 65 necro pet and assumed the equivalent mage pet.
Sean points out the innate DS on the epic pet which may very well make
all the difference.  So I guess it's mage epic v. necro 65, mage epic
wins?

And you would still bet on necro even though mage can nuke for 1.4k
(this is in the case of owners helping out in duel)?
