The reason that some things, like murder, are considered almost
commonplace (there are a few examples where this is/was not true) is
that it is bad for society.  Unchecked killing in the streets does not
lend itself to a progressive way of life.

Homosexuality is still considered immoral to probably the majority of
people.  It's even legislated against in lots of places.  But it's not
BAD for a society.  One could even argue that with the way people
breed, getting a segment of people to turn to homosexuality might be a
good thing.  But it's still considered, by the majority, immoral.

See above.  Murder and theft is bad for a society.  THAT'S why they
should be legislated against.  Morality doesn't need to enter into it.

The vast majority of people find drug use to be immoral, despite the
fact that I can see no difference between getting lit and getting
drunk.  Why is getting shit faced drunk allowed, but high on marijuana
isn't?  Because drugs are immoral where alcohol is not.  So a morality
law is created, which only helps to INCREASE crime on the streets.

Yay morality.

As an aside, I don't use any kind of drugs recreationally, including
alcohol.

I'll can think of a few instances where people have been evil.
Solders in the concentration camps were, probably, evil.

True evil is a rare thing though.  Not non existent, but so rare as
that a person can go their whole life without having to experience it.
If they are lucky.
