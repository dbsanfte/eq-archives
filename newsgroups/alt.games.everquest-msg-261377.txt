Granted,I am not normally into long discussions of parsing, I 
want the bottom line of which weapon I should get, or which 
mobs/zzones for whatever character are best...but I heartily 
appreciate people willing to take the time to do the parsing.

Everybody plays for different reasons...I play for fun and to be 
with friends, I know people who are into serious raiding, and I 
know someone who has soloed almost all of his 65 levels as a SK. 
I know a casual player who has done nothing but LDoNs after level 
20, and is now a very happy 55. I have grouped, and solod, and 
raided in my time. I will continue to do so as much as possible=)
And it doesnt matter that I can play 16 hours a day because I 
cant find a job, or can only play 3 hours a night becauase I have 
a job...as long as it remains fun, I will play.
