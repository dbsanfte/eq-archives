Gears suckiness is a matter of opinion really.  Lots of places you can get
gear that is easily good enough to keep you going (it wont be uber...), from
mobs around your level.

One mans gold is another mans coal etc.

Is hard to define I guess, most people are never satisfied with their gear
and want better...but how much better it has to be varies from person to
person.

Soz for sorta derail :P
