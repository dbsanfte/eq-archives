Vendors buy items from players, as well as sell to them.  Each vendor
has his normal stock in trade, in almost every case an unlimited
supply.  In addition he has a number of slots filled with items he
has purchased.  Many vendors, however, have purchased far more
types of items than they have space to display.

When you go to a vendor hoping to buy something, and he doesn't have
it on display, it is possible to check some of his remaining spaces.
Simply buy -all- of an item that he has on display.  This could be one,
it could be a hundred... there's an upper limit but I forget what it
is.  At
any rate, this creates a new opening for display.  Hit done and then
check him again, he will have a new item at the end of his list (unless
he didn't have more types of items than he had spaces, after all.

That is called bleeding the vendor.

Its generally a fools game, unless you are rich, as the vendor probably
has 20 extra spaces worth of items and may not have the one you
want at all.  Still, it can pay off.  If you want to indulge, the trick
is to
look for affordable items, get your cha to 105 and your faction to
better
than indifferent... this way you are paying the lowest possible price.

Then take those items you bought over to a second vendor, one that you
know is out of the item you want (probably cause you already bought
them all) and sell for the highest possible price.

I find gems to be the item with the least difference between buy and
sell
prices, if that helps.

As for this being cheating, quite the reverse.  In most cases the vendor

ripped off the player by offering far less than you would voluntarily
have
paid him, and at the same time usually is selling the item for far more
than the generally agreed on "going rate" for that item.  There are some

exceptions; very often vendors pay far more than a player would for
certain items that are generally considered junk, and sometimes a
vendor sells items for far less than their percieved values (crushbone
belts for example vend for around a gold piece while players will
happily
part with a couple Platinum for them.


Hope I killed the HTML, lets find out
