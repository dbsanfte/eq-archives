Fascinating. Do you also postulate that cancer, sars, and the myriad of 
other virii and genetic defects is also the deliberate act of God, and 
"2nd guessing the master" by seeking to extinct these creations you 
degrade God's work? How does one differentiate the aberrations that must 
be fought from God's deliberate creationist endeavour?

Hmmm... looks like you do have a litmus test (see below)... but I hope 
you aren't serious...

Ergo ... Raping young children is natural. There is no right or wrong, 
no moral issue.

Come again?! Well...the application of your assumption to other premises 
gives us: If the rape of young children is happening then its natural.

If the fact of an occurance of an act is our litmus test for what is 
natural then the conclusion I deduced is incontrovertible.

Now I suggest you take a step back and rethink your argument, not your 
sentiment necessarily, as I happen to have no issue with homosexuals. I 
simply take exception to the gruesomely flawed line of reasoning you've 
taken getting there.

Bang. ;)
