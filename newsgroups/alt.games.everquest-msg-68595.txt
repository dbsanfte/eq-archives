Does anybody have experience with them? I looked at them (Scream of .. Series)
adn they look rather useless to me, totally useless I mean. One of them gives
me 0.7% more ATK (completely useless) at my current level (30). And the level
30 spell (Scream of Pain I think) gives me 6 AC. Ok it's a 'tap' so the enemy
loses 6 AC, but buffers of the same level (example: Shaman) has a shield giving
me and others 11 AC at lvl 24, or 20 AC at level 34. For a self-only melee
class spell, those 6 AC sound a bit ridiculous for a spell we get at halfway
to the top. I'd have expected it to be at least 10 AC or something that
givs you an edge. If an SK is just a less powerful warrior, we have to excel
at soemthing else in combat, not (Yes, so we can invis, IVU, HT and now
get a horse by click .. but still....). At least you'd not feel like a
redundant DOT on a raid.. :)
