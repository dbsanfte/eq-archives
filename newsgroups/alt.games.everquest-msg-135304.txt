I think your looking for something that just doesn't exist.

Makeleader adding possible CoH exploits?  gee if thats not paranoia I dunno
what is :)

Want to CoH some people from the zoneline, and your deep inside the zone?

Ok, Magician and Wizard group up. Wizard evacs to the zoneline, invites
people, mage coh's.. bingo they are with your raid.  Yes, its *that* easy.

Lets use a different example, where you can't gate or succor to... the
Statue of Rallos Zeks room in Kael is a good example.  A guild monk on his
first statue pull dropped into the room for the pull, not realising theres
no way out of the room.

No mage in his group, a problem?  Not at all.. I run to the room, get the
monk on target, run back to the raid and the magician assists me (to get the
monks target).  The mage then invites him, and CoH's him.

To make it even simpler, I make a new group with the mage, run to the
stranded monk and invite him.  The magician simply presses F3, then casts
CoH.

New exploits? What exploits?
