It's because your tailoring overall sucks. It's not odd at all.

If you can't cook beyond putting an egg in a pot with some water and
leave it on heat for a while, you shouldn't expect to get a perfect,
soft boiled egg too often.

Oh, and your skill in replying on usenet could use some skilling up as
well as your tailoring.
