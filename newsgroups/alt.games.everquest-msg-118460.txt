So you can destroy them? I honestly didn't know that, nor had I tried.
Its that I hate to destroy such pretty armour. LOL!!

I'll try that when I go back to the bank the next time. (At least I'm
not forced to carry the damn stuff around).

And I second your exasperation abour corpses laying all around. You
should've seen the docks in Oasis of Marr this morning. There were a
ton of PC corpses, but just as many NPC corpses as well. Looked like
one heck of a battle field.

Catch you later,
