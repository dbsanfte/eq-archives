I've made an Iksar monk on Ayonae Ro, and I'm now level 18.  I've had great
fun playing this character, probably more fun than any of my other
characters (Necro, Druid, Ranger) and I now have a bit of money saved up in
the bank (around 24pp, plus two HQ Cat Pelts, 2 MQ Cat Pelts, and 2
Excellent Sabertooth Tiger Hides, which I am going to sell, although I can't
figure out what to ask for them, but that's another question.  Anyway, I
have a bunch of Curscale armor and two Heavy Iron Ulaks right now but I'm
looking to buy some better armor.  I can't find any of the shops in Cabilis
that sell anything better that doesn't way a ton, and I'm wonder where a
good place for my character to go to find some better stuff.  Not looking
for anything great since I'm not that rich yet, just some kind of upgrade.
I want to feel like my money is going somewhere rather than just rotting in
the bank.  Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you in
advance.  Oh, by the way, I'm still bound in the Field of Bone, haven't
ventured much beyond Cabilis, just LOIO and FoB/Kurn's Tower.
