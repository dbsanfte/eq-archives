Well, he certainly was a bandit then. I'm not sure why you couldn't hit him
though. Maybe some of the more experienced folks here can tell you why. I
wander around lost, most of the time ;)

Last week, that stupid pet killed me *5* times in the damn water. I was
attempting to get my swimming up (didn't know it was a bad place to try to
do so) and I met up with Xytl's pet all 5 times. I finally had to ask one of
the higher lvl players in the game if they could recover my corpses for me.
A very nice lady did so, and killed Xytl's pet and Xytl, into the bargain! I
had to /kneel and thank her most profusely when she dragged out my last (and
1st) corpse! He sucks, and when I get old enough, I'm gonna kill him about
10000 times, just for the fun of it! ;) Bet your dad was pissed too, huh? :)
