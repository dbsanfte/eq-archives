I won't list my credentials behind my response since that might distract

You are aware of the differences between cracking the license code and
cracking a password of course?

You are making some assumptions here and they may be the basis for some
miscalculation in the rest of your theories.  You working on the
assumption that the password is sent in the same encrypted format every
time.  You also state that this would be the same encryption process
used to create the account initially via the account code.  The latter
is extremely doubtful as entirely different server processes are
involved running on very different sorts of servers.  The former is
obviously not the case either, else you would have seen a plethora of
cracks by now and the script kiddies would be using them w/o a clue of
how they worked.

Your postings have made for wonderful reading over morning coffee
though, thanks for the smiles.
