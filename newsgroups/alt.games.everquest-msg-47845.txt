A Few Personal Notes: 

Before I worked at the California Cafe, I worked in the electronics
industry in Santa Clara Valley. When I was layed off after seven
years-- I was even shift leader-- my supervisor said "get out of the
industry," which I took to heart. After a year off, I decided it was
time to go for a job I chose for a change, instead of one that "chose
me". The first place I applied was the California Cafe, and I was
hired. I have been cooking since I was a child and entertaining since
I was in high school, and I wish I had gotten into the business a
really long time ago. My goals are to open a delicatessen in the next
few years, and to ultimately open a B&B in eastern California. The
latter may take a little time, but I'm confident it will happen. The
deli is a bit more up in the air; I have considered a small sausage
making company, but I think a deli would be more fun, and fun is
basically why I am involved in this business in the first place!!

Personal Interests 
Although I don't really have a lot of time, in the past 10 years I
have been involved with flyfishing, backpacking, cross-country
skiing, rock climbing, photography, and homebrewing. I'm an
accomplished gardener and have maintained an orchard. I'm interested
in anything to do with food, from history to preparation. Computers
(obviously) are another strong interest. I have a high aptitude for
record keeping and mathematics, but don't particularly enjoy either.
