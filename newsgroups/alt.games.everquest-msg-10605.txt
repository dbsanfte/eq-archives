Ignore Dan's bogus advice. The very fact the mob is an "add", means it
belongs to the group who agroed it. This clearly falls within Verant's
PnP. The person (or group) to first agro the mob gain rights to kill
that mob. Any intervention after that is regarded as KSing.

The only exception is when the original person (or group) to agro the
mob releases the mob's agro. i.e. if they die or zone.

If you follow that policy, you will find yourself in very few
confrontations in the future. As originally stated... when you *do*
get in that situation again, simply apologise and move on. If they
won't let it drop, ignore them. Mistakes happen.
