There's still data for the item on my computer. Stats and graphics.
Those are all in the client software. The server holds a line on your
character saying that he/she has the item.

The item, again, exists in the client software. The server recognizes
whether or not your character has the item and adjusts your "stats"
accordingly.

Yes, the data for the item is kept. A dupe bug isn't creating new
data, it's adjusting data that always exists on your character. As far
as the server is concerned, all of your items are nothing more than
flags on your character that tell it how it should adjust your
performance.

No, you can get the STATS for a Blade of Carnage off Alla's. The data
is the information in the client software that tells the game what
it's stats are and what it looks like.

What is this "instance made" tripe. The item exists on the client
software, whether your character currently possesses one or not. The
item is always there. Trading it will never change that. All trading
an item does is gives someone else access to the item while closing
off yours until you regain it by taking the steps to gain access to
the item again ( camping/questing/crafting ). No copies/instances are
made by trading, you're just adjusting a few numbers and flags.

I still have the BoC on my system, I just can't USE it.

However, if you really want to go with the "instances" and it only
exists on the server argument, fine. That actually gives you even LESS
right to sell it, since that gives you even less argument that you
actually owned it in the first place. Kinda like going to the public
pool and charging people to use the sun chairs that the pool owns.

Would help if you understood copyright and intellectual property law
better.

They have the right to control how their intellectual property is
used. You either sell it as a whole or not at all. A BoC is a part of
the whole, so you cannot sell just the BoC.

There's also contract law. You know, that little one that hardly
anyone bothers to read that they agree to every time they play?
Clicking "I Agree" when it's the only way to play the game (without
hacking it out) is just as valid as a signature on paper. All the
signature on a paper contract does is prove that you agreed to it,
it's not relevant whether you actually read it or not. Since you MUST
go through the EULA to play EQ, the fact you've played the game proves
you agreed to that contract. (Even if you hacked it so it doesn't come
up. The unmodified game requires that you go through the EULA, thus,
it's considered "signed" when you play)

I'm not searching for anything. I KNOW it's a violation of copyright.

FBI doesn't raid for copyright infringement (Except in some
exceptionally large cases). It's civil law. Why's IGE so hard to
touch? They're not based in the US... It'd take more work and money by
far to try to get a court to agree that doing business in the US
subjects them to US copyright law, and it's not a guarantee outcome.
