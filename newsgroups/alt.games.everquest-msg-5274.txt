That sounds good for a level 30. Better than I was at 30, for sure. =)

The extra AGI will slightly increase the chance of a mob missing you when
attacking. This can be crucial during some situations .. For instance, on a
recent Naggy raid, I dodged 3 attacks in a row and got a Superior Heal off
on a Warrior who had no red in his health bar left -- It was that heal that
probably determined the outcome of that fight, as he was one of two meleers
left standing when the beast fell. =)

Np man. What server you play on, by the way?
