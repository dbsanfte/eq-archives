Ok, I'm not familiar with high end dungeons, so I've gotta ask what FFA
actually entails.  Are there zones where the player population supports
stealing a mob that's already engaged?  If so, who thought up that policy,
and what does it say about the players that condone it?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
