Of course, Runnyeye is always an option, and if you're clever, you can get
to EK with relative ease.  My Halfling did a few levels there, then went to
Qeynos, then to Odus (for The Warrens), then to Faydwer (for Unrest), then
the moon (Paludal), and is currently back in Unrest.  She'll hit 30th soon.
