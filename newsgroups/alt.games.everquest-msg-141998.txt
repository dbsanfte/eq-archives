There's not a horrible lot of fights that jboots are effective instaclicks.

And in fights that they aren't useful in, the buff slot has better uses
anyways, like tossing an 8th copy of predator on or something. (I dunno if
they fixed that or not, but a couple months ago I saw a guy's screenshot of
having 12 slots with one of the major ranger ATK buffs in it, he had over 2k
ATK;  here we go, found the pic
