I generally am paired with my wife but she doesn't play as much as
I do.   So I've channelling 80% of mine towards the alt XP to let her
get a bit closer in level with me.  Like you, I "stopped leveling" at 52
so I could still do Naggy and Vox but would have Heroism and the
new undead DoT.

I plan on putting mine on my cleric into increased WIS first (for five)
and then the other probably into STR or STA.   Both are lacking due
to the race selection I made, so that will make it a bit easier to swap
out some gear I've got for resists.

After that it'll be the higher-level abilities, which are class-related.
I'd imagine mental clarity will be first at 55, and I haven't looked at
the 59 level ones enough yet to know.   That's a ways off.
