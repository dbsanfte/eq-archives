A case can be made for EQ having more in common with a 10-year business 
plan than a game...

I'll probably fairly exceed the recommended specs by the time it comes 
out, and yet... I don't think it will be possible to recapture the 
feeling of being a newbie in a world of newbies, where nobody knows what 
to expect. I don't think I could stomach to log into EQ2 for the first 
time only to choke in the dust left by those with l33t B3tA inf0z 
rushing to be the first to level 100 or whatever.

Early EQ was a very unique experience... I don't think it will ever 
quite happen again.
