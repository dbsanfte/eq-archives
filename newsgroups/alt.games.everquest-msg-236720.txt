I seem to get skill ups fine when fighting yellow/reds. My BL (restarted
again on FV) is now level 17 and all weapons skills are maxed except 2hb
(which I will just spend points on probably) and I have been doing 90%
yellows and reds solo (gear PL'ing not second toon).
I have taken time after each new spell level to max spells as well while I
watch a DVD on the other machine. The one thing that I have seen is my
defense is maxed within the first 2 - 5 minutes of a new level, because
everything connects with me...........
