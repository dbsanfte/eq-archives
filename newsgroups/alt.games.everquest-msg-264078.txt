It's unlikely that an individual dev team gets to set it's own philosophy on
customer service.  There's a bit more leeway on game design, but the reality
is that attitudes and culture at SOE is likely to be similar, even across
different products.   This comes both from developer/designer cross-pollination
and from top-down leadership (John Smedley sets the tone and vision for the 
whole division).

It's a different product, with (mostly) different architects and coders.  It's
the same company, with the same attitudes toward customers and philosophy of
game publishing.
