I bought the half-elf lore quest.  The first page said go to Antonica
(this character is from Freeport).  The next page said go to The
Commonlands.  The next page said go to Thundering Steppes (way south).
It just ping-ponged around the two continents the whole way through the
book.  Annoying.  Then it directed me to The Feerrot (I think that's
where it was).  I stopped it then because I wasn't high enough level to
get there.
