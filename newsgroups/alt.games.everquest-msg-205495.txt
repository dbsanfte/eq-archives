A lot will depend on the levels of the shamans in question.  Shaman get 
their best single target slow at level 51, it maxxes out it's slow effect 
at level 60.  As for debuffs, we do get two unresistable general debuffs, 
Malo at 60, and Malos at 65.  Those can be invaluable in getting a better 
debuff and other spells to stick.  It's faster if you have one shaman 
casting Malo/Malos, and a second casting slow, as well as reducing the 
agro generated by the slower.  Realistically though, I have found that we 
don't stack very well.  Two is usually quite sufficient, and gives you 
backup in case slow is resisted and the first one goes down.  As far as 
buffs go, we do tend to split them, based on who has the best, and where 
equal, the lower shaman handles those buffs.
