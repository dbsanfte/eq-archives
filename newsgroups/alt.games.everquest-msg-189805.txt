Aha.. Ok. That leads me to my next question then. Mind you Im not
questioning your answer, just trying to understand the reason behind it. Why
in the heck would a Ranger, who already has a whole plethora of spells that
can raise his/her DPS be on a damage table that will, all things being
equal, have him/her outdamage the Poor little warrior, even without the
additional perks of Nukes, DOTs, and ATK Raising spells ?

Color me confused....
