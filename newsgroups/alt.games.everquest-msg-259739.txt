Yeah, this is basically the approach I used in City of Heroes to get duo 
Task Forces with my wife. I'd recruit a full group to do a Task Force, and 
then once we had it, thank them for their cooperation and let them leave 
while we finished off the event.  It was much more feasible in that game 
because of the way they dynamically scaled encounters to the size and level 
of the group. I'm not sure how solo-able most LDoNs would be for my Shaman 
character since they do not scale and I never tried it, but I'd love to hear 
from others have.
