I do use "alt" sometimes, though that is a pretty recent "slangation".  They
were just "twinks" for years, now they're "alts".  =)

Camps are nuts.  Just using Sebilis as an example, as it's been discussed on
this newsgroup plenty, the camps were UZO, LZO, jail, guard, disco, chef,
crypt, juggs, king.  Other than chef and disco, which seem pretty standard
across servers, I've seen those camps called all kinds of things.
