Inner Fire is your first HP buff, it is level 1, it is also your most 
efficient heal spell mana wise at low levels.  Don't waste mana on 
keeping the anemic DEX, STR, and AGI buffs on the MA.  The amount that 
they buff is minimal, and their effect is negligable.  Save your mana for 
healing if you are the primary healer.

At higher levels, you can get a very fast DoT, 7 ticks, or just over 1 
minute duration, so keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to 
DoT.

Mages get essentially the same line of debuff spells, with just one or 
two differences at higher levels as I recall.
