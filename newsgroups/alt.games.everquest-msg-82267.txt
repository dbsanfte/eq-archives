    Keep the guildies in the random. Then get them to give it to you. :-)

    On our server, stuff is randomed as it drops. Some groups like to keep
track of who has won something in the past, and not let them win again until
everyone has something, but what I find is with items that just encourages
them to leave after they win. I want LESS group flux, not more.

    My Sebilis luck was absurdly bad. I can't tell you how many Heiro
Cloaks, Fungi Tunics, RBGs, Lammys, and other nice items I lost out on. And
I won almost nothing. Moving to Velk's and winning rolls again was a
pleasant change. :-)

    Master looting? No master looting on OUR server. Nobody trusts anyone
enough for that. So you get what you loot. Must be nice on Prexus! Even
then, though, with cash loots only you're looking at a cleric having to get
60 pp in cash per 45 minutes or so to keep up with expenses. It's hardly a
"sure thing" then. And people who get Pinzarn and not Naltron whine and
complain....

    Again, must be nice. All classes that can use roll, anyone with SS/Kael
in that slot drops out (they can't claim need).

    Yes, it would likely be an upgrade for many people's cloaks. But calling
NBG in an area where two items of interest to a cleric drop out of the
twelve drops, then making sure everyone else there is rolling on the cleric
items, pretty much ensures the cleric isn't getting a thing. I came out of
Crypt more than a few times in a *negative* cash position for the night
(boo, crappy rolls) - not many other classes can say that adventuring makes
them lose money.

    The pp drops are fair (Crypt) to awful ('Shroom King), and you're still
sharing those with the group. Not enough to replace gem costs - I've been
there, I've done the math. And that cleric has the exact same chance of
winning a Fungi as the monk beside him who isn't paying one copper piece to
be there. Well, he's eating his food and drink. :-( So saying "You could win
Fungi, so stop whining about gem costs" isn't fair - I lose cash on gems ON
TOP OF anything we make back.

    NM saves you a ton of cash. I'd guesstimate that I've made back the 10 K
pp I paid for my copy of the spell in reduced reagent costs.
