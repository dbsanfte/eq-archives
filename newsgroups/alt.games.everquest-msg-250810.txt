I think your last point is probably the most important. EQ is just old,
and not drawing new players at anywhere near the rate it did when it was
new. This has a huge disincentive to travel, as especially while low
level, travel is extremely dangerous solo. Other than Paludal caverns,
there is no place I know of that rising newbies can congregate in a
healthy enough level to readily find groups.
