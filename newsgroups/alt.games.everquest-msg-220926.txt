	It's much harder to med between kills in Overthere, especially
at night, without drawing aggro from some wandering mob.  It can be
difficult to sit for root & rot because of adds, and except for 
stonegazers there's almost no loot at all.  They may have fewer HP
but not enough to matter at my level:  I can kill 2 blue OT mobs and have
_almost_ enough mana for a third, or I can kill two giants and have
not enough for a third...

	BTW some of the Sarnaks are casters.

	I'd agree with nerfing their drops down to 5p and some fine steel.
Although it is sort of fun to hit the Hill Giant Lottery :-)
