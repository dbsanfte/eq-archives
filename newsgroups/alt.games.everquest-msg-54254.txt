Uhh... One trip through the stein of moggok quest, followed by a quick 
sale in ec, should give you double that.  Only spells you really need are 
illusion: Dark Elf and Alliance... Gate makes it go a lot quicker, though. 
:)

And if you need that much money before you can do the stein quest?  Take 
up fletching and do trueshot bows.  At fletching (80) which cost almost 
nothing to get since you're selling the arrows back instead of using them 
all, I finally managed to successfully make a Trueshot on the 5th try.  
It was some work, but it sold for my spell money and plenty of change.

Thank goodness microservos drop off runaway clockworks... :)
