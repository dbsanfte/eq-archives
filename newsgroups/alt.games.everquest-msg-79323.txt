They could get someones help, to drag their corpse to a
safe place to loot it, or they could get an invis spell by someone.

You bet - best thing is you decide early with which people you
want to make friends: Easiest if West Freeport, as you will be
dubiously (i.e. not kill on sight) right from the start, then you
can turn in orc belts in the militia house to further increase your faction
and do some rogue quest to get the merchants to like you.

The other way (my way) is to turn in milk (about 35 stacks, 4 at a time)
to a guy at the lake in west commons and get kill on sight to
freeport militia but become well liked in north freeport, where
the bank is and also a lot of merchants are.

The other faction quite easy (but far away) is queynos:
Kill about 300 gnolls (I think I killed that many in an hour last
time there) in Blackburrow, max level is maybe 15, and you will at
least be dubious to the guards, so they will not attack you
anymore in the Queynos Hills or when you enter the city zone.

Later in the game you will be able get through north ro,
oasis, south ro and innothule swamp to grobb (small city,
trolls) and onwards through feerott to oggok,
where you are also liked (ogre faction).

Then there is the evil outpost in the Overthere (Kunark), and you will
be able to get faction with Paineel, one of the Erudite
cities, maybe even Erudin.

If you have the Velious expansion, then (at level 35 upwards) you can
shop in Thurgadin by default, and then either go for Thurgadin faction
by killing giants, or Kael Drakkel (giant) faction by killing dwarves.

Then there is also Luclin, but I don't have that yet, so that's for someone
else to tell you...

In all the other places I know of (Cabilis, Kelethin, Kaladim,
Firiona Vie outpost, Rivervale...) you will be pretty much hated
all your lifetime.

You _can_, however, make friends with the druids in Surefall,
also by killing gnolls, though that will probably take ages.
