I'll second that suggestion heartily. Both my human necro and my wife's
DE necro had faction issues with the merchants in the FP area initially.
Learn your way around the tunnels and find the two quest mobs for the
Janem and Rebby quest. I did it over and over for one play session and
could trade with everyone. Later, I still did it every time I came back
into town for supplies, new spells, training, etc. I have a necro who is
loved all over all three FP zones now through various hunting and
questing activities. The xp isn't bad at low levels either and the
quest's are quick and easy, only one zone apart. Once you have bind and
gate, you can REALLY do them fast.
