You know I always wondered about that.  With any of the characters I played,
if they went for a swim, engaged in melee, etc., starting way back over 2
years ago, I'd notice that even when the yellow bar was empty I could still
run, swim, and melee.  So when I started my first melee (a Rogue) about a
year ago I just ignored the Sta bar.  Now most likely it was my imagination
but occassionally when hasted and out of Sta I thought I would see a tiny
slowing in my melee and a little less dmg but that was only when hasted.
Like they say... better late than never but my suspissons have been
confirmed.
