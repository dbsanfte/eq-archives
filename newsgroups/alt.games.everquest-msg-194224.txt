	Welcome to the Wonderful World of Jury Nullification.

	"Jury nullification" is the principle stating that a jury has the power to
acquit on the grounds that justice would not be served by a conviction; that
the law simply does not apply in this particular case.  It is one of the most
hotly contested principles in American jurisprudence.  While a federal appeals
court ruled in (IIRC) the late 60s that juries have an unconditional right to
acquit, in general lawyers (defense attorneys and prosecutors), judges and
politicians ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE the idea of jury nullification.  They
don't like anything that might give people silly ideas like, say, that a trial
should be about justice and the merits of the cases for and against instead of
blindly following the sacred texts, or even worse, the idea that the law
belongs to the people and not to the priests who write those texts and claim
the sole right of interpreting them.

	AFAIK, in most if not all jurisdictions, it is not permitted for the
defense to incite to nullify, in spite of the aforementioned federal court
decision.  (The issue has never made it to the Supreme Court AFAIK.)  There
was a minor flap recently out in California when a doctor was arrested for
giving marijuana to his patients in violation of local law but in accordance
with federal law, and the judge not only didn't inform the jury of the
contravening federal law, but blocked an defense attempt to incite to nullify,
telling the jury that they had no choice but to enforce the law as he
interpreted it to them.
