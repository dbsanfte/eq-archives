A similar thing happened to me a while back.

I was going thru the tunnel in EC to N Ro.  When I got to where the zone
line was ....nothing happened ...I just kept on going.  Eventually I came to
the end of the tunnel that opened on to nothing but sky!

I was afraid to go thru it so I camped and came back right at the zone line.
Everything was fine after that.  *shrug*
