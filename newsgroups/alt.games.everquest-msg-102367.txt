What planet do you live on?

It has been a federal felony for any "nut" (or anyone previously
convicted of *any* kind of felony, no matter how non-violent or minor)
to buy (or even *hold*) a firearm, or for *anyone* to knowingly sell 
to one, since 1968.

Did this make the anti-gun nuts happy?  No, it didn't, they went
on to lobby for things like the 1977 Washington DC law that
effectively made it impossible for *any* civilian to own a
handgun, period, and the (failed) Russo bill in New Jersey which
would have outlawed all handgun sales and transfers.  (Incidentally,
firearm homicides almost *tripled* in DC after the ban was passed.)
And then the same groups that fought hard for those laws swore up 
and down that they do not actually support outlawing civilian 
ownership of handguns ("Handgun Control, Inc., [snip]
works to enact stronger federal, state, and local gun control 
laws, but does not seek to ban handguns").  Yeah, right, we
believe them...

In 1993, they got your "do a background check or lose your
license" wet dream.  Sarah Brady called it, and I quote,
"[It's] everything on my wish list that I've been wishing for at
a federal level."  A short time later, she was calling it
"a good first step", and the very next year was pushing for
federal laws outlawing of single-shot, medium-caliber rifles,
and the incredibly draconian "Brady II" bill which would have,
for example, made owning two boxes of .22 ammunition a felony
without a very expensive federal "arsenal license".

Did the anti-gun nuts retire when they got their "do background
checks or lose your license"?  No, in the past couple years they've
banded together to push multiple frivolous lawsuits that attempt
to totally bankrupt firearm manufacturers (including those who
manufacture the most popular police sidearms) by trying to
sue them for every dollar of damages caused by every single
criminal misuse of any firearm anywhere.  I am not making this
up.

These nuts are not after "reasonable" laws to limit criminal
use.  They are after the complete destruction of firearm ownership
in this country.
