He is saying you are attacking 40% more often than you were with no
haste. Why he would say damage and not number of attacks is beyond me.

I know, that's almost how it reads, but I am pretty sure he actually
meant number of attacks. Besides, it really is number of attacks
increased, and his own examples show that.
