PALUDAL CAVERNS just off of Shadowhaven on the moon.    Best exp I have seen
in the game for that level.   I got my chanter from 14 to 26 in 3
nights.......not uncommon to get 5 or 6 levels in a night.    I have put
several friend on it and they cant believe the exp.  Also you can bind in SH
and easy access to vendors.  I give it 5 stars.
Good Luck.
