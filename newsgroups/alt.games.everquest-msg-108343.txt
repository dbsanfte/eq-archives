Sorry, I followed that link, but it must have been the wrong one. (I may
have cut and pasted improperly.) You are saying you had a tank doing
5000 DPS which is 300,000 DD per minute, or nearly a million damage in
one minute. I'm not seeing it from that log. Could you please point me
to the correct thread?
