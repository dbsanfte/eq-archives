Yelinak (maybe), Sontalaak, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Lendinaria.

Also Vindi, Statue, Tormax, AoW and some other mobs have a *chance* of
dropping a key.

Don't die.  Nothing earth-shattering to figure out.

Couple hours on yard trash.  That can be an issue, but you have to be moving
*real* slow for it to be a problem.  No real clue on boss mobs, just did
them when I found them up.

Nothing that can't be figured out by whoever is the tactician in your guild. 
If you don't have a tactician in your guild expect a few wipes until someone
steps up to be the tactician.  :)

> safe spots?

Yeah, at the zonein.  Actually lots of safe spots, but that doesn't matter
much.  Adds are never an issue unless adds are an issue.  And if adds are an
issue you aren't going to avoid them in a safe spot.  :)
