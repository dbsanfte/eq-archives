I agree that is is quite redundant to ask someone to send you a tell
but unfortunatly a lot of people dont send tells, they just reply in
OOC. I wonder how many of them really DO need that pst at the end of a
shout for group. Heres a common situation and in a crowded zone it can
scroll by fast.

player 1 shouts "22nd Ranger LFG"
player 2 shouts "PC on Zizzumflop"
player 3 shouts "Incoming Skeleton to mill.....plz heal me!"
player 4 shouts "19th enchanter LFG"
player 5 shouts "Ledge group needs one more....pst"
player 6 shouts "Come to gobbie tunnels"
player 1 shouts "OMW"
player 4 sends tell to player 6 "OMW"
player 7 shouts "25th druid LFG"
player 8 shouts "Come to ledge"
player 7 shouts "Who me?"
player 9 shouts "Trading SoW for breeze at mill"

and this all scrolls by in a matter of seconds.
sending tells is preferable.....and hopefully they dont have a screwed
up name that is hard to type. and hopefully again, one would think you
wouldnt HAVE to add a dumb "pst" to the end of your line.
