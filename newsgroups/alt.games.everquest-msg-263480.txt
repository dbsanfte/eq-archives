    I dont think it's no mana.

    If you cast and its rejected with "your spell would not have taken
hold", the cast is interrupted and you spend no mana.

    If you cast and "your spell did not take hold" than I think your mana is
spent. If not, im surprised. Why should you get a refund for that?

    Either yeah, they should ditch the agro from it (in which case
shadowknights below 67 lose the ability to hold agro), or it should NOT be
refunding your mana.

    Gonna leave that one alone in the interests of not constantly whining
about my class ;)
