Getting married within the game, or quiting a Guild/Clan that has
taken the same surname has been used in the past to convince GMs to
delete/remove. You maybe able to convince a GM that you name is too
long, but that is completely subjective. You would have to rely on the
mood and inclination of the GM at the time.

In your case, just have a friend (or several- preferrably not in your
guild) petition your surname as a violation. "Lane Splitting" is a
reference to driving a motorcyle between cars that are stacked up on a
congested freeway. When/If you are contacted by a GM be polite,
apologize for the violation, and allow the GM to remove the name.
