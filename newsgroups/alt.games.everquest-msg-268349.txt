I'm brand new to both after having been with EQ since Kunark days. Thus far WoW
seems far too cartoonish and the toons too carelessly drawn as is the scenery.
At least that's the way it seems to me. EQ2 seems generations more
sophisticated  in all respects and at the default settings, runs fine on my HP
a450n, 512 megs RAM  (I'll be upgrading to two gig soon) and the Nvidea 
GeForce 5200.  Oh it clocks at 3.2 gigs

I'll give Wow  more time but thus far I'm not particularly impressed with it.

Just my opinion of course.
