It suddenly occurs to me that this would mean you should get into one of those
"former hell levels" and then slide the AA button to full.  Getting twice as much
experience as you should be, to compensate for the level being twice as large as
it should be, would mean quite a lot when just doing AA; an AA is locked at the
price of level 51.

And if the other levels are penalized a bit to also help even things out, then
you'd be getting -more- than twice as much AA exp as in the other levels.

Probably doesn't work that way, but if it does, the ideal AA level would be 59,
not the 60 that many people shoot for.

6 levels too high to take advantage of this if its true!
