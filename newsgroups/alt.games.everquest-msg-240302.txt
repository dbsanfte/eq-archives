Actually, IIRC, in one of the recent patches they specifically added
better mitigation for warriors over knights and other classes. But
that's what pocket developers do for us warriors. At the same time, HP
for a warrior in similar level gear has always been significantly
greater for a Warrior than for a Knight and we normally get our HP
AA(ND3, PD3, PE) sooner. At the same time, Warriors were tossed a bone
in the new expansion. There is a GoD AA with 5 levels that when
maxxed(at the fucked up total of 60AA), that gives a total of 500hp
extra, 100 per rank. That having been said, a group is deaf, dumb, and
stupid to take a warrior with zip for defensive AA(LR/ID) over a
pally/SK with defensive or vice versa. LR/ID really seperates a tank
from not regardless of class.

Raid level mobs, the disparity is even more so. You just don't look
for a pally or SK to tank the big dogs either as the main guy or even
in the tank order because on tank transition a Warrior will dust a
Knight seven ways from sunday with the new melee changes. I'm still
surprised Knights never shit their pants over the fact that Warriors
basically can now do a 12-second DA without compromising defensive,
but ignorance is cool. It used to be you'd lose a few tanks on
elemental level mobs if the MT went down, now its just
furious/AT/incite/and defensive when furious drops. If your CH chain
can't get on the new tank in the 12 seconds he's not getting hit, they
need to be fired.

As stated, equally outfitted warrior brings more hp absorbtion wise,
Knight brings better agro-wise. Still, the difference between having
defensive AA and not is such that you go with the defensive AA
regardless of class.
