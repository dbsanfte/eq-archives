I'll go with Alexa's vote. You can solo a shammy well enough (though not
as good as some others) and shammies will be welcome in groups and guild
raids at every level to the end of the game far more than any of the
other soloable classes.

Druids solo extrememly well, but even with their incomlete heal, are
probably one of the least "needed" raid classes to this day. (Much
better than previously though, when they were often in the "dont bother
applying" category for many guilds.) Necros are probably in a tie for
the best soloing class in the game, but their raid function is fairly
limited, (and not much fun if you talk to the necros) so many high end
guilds aren't looking for a whole bunch of them.) Mages are good
soloers, nearly up there with necros at many levels, and are also highly
desired in guilds.

If you're really masochistic, wizards *can* be solo'd up to the end
game, and if you make it all the way to the ubah levels, are still
fairly sought after by raiding guilds.
