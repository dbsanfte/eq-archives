I only ask because there don't seem to be many posts about the new areas/new
MOBs/phat lewts.

Oh and I thought you might like this exchange from guildchat last night.....

"So, what you're saying is that the game runs okay as long as you turn off
all the new models, turn down the texture resolution and don't try to visit
Luclin zones"
"Yeah"
"Bet you're glad you bought it then"
"Hmmmm"

Made me laugh anyway.
