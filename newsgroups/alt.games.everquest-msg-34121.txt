Not sure how it works in EQ of course, but I remember when I used to be an
IMMORTAL on a MUD I had a lot of powers at my fingers.  I could manipulate
zones, create new lands, summon items into being, kill things with a single
meteor swarm, etc.  That was as a designer, when  I would log on to do
adminastrative stuff, if there was a dispute or something I could LITERALLY do
a command called SNOOP (Playername) and it would show me everything that
(Playername) was doing.  
   If for example (Playername) was lost, I could use that command and then
possess their bodies and move them to a safe zone, if I felt like being nice to
them and all.  
    Now I would imagine that Everquest coding works no different, the GM's and
possibly guides have a way to SNOOP through your eyes and see what's going on
in the world around you.  Or, I suppose they could just put their nifty Invis
spell on and stand their watching, but it would probably help them more to
watch the text that's going on in your chat box, which I can pretty much
guarentee they can do.
    As far as Possession, I don't know how they would go about doing that in
everquest, but if there is a way to SNOOP I can bet there is a way to Possess
as well. It just seems logical that the game designers would give their
Administrators these powers.
