My honest opinion is that you should have stayed to the bitter end, but I
don't know enough about the situation to form a firm opinion.  What was the
fighter's health at and how far away was the zone line?  If you and the
wizzie have gate memmed, you both have a far easier means of leaving the
situation than the fighter (and if the wizzie had an evac spell and didn't
have it memmed or didn't use it - grrrrr!).  It's one thing for you to say
"Run" and click a button, it's another for the fighter, probably low on
health, to turn his back  and try to run to the zone line.  Was it
reasonable to believe that if he turned his back on the mobs and ran that he
had any hope of making the zone line?  If not, you should have stayed and
died as a group.  If he did have the chance to run, then I would say what
you did was acceptable, but I still would have stayed even if the fighter
was being stupid.  I have been in this same type of situation, when the
situation was obviously hopeless (usually due to the puller biting off more
than the group could chew) and I could have gated but decided to fall on my
sword.  I remember one time in S. Karana the puller ran out and came back
with about 8 aviaks in tow, including two Avocets (which we could only
handle one at a time as a group).  No one broke and ran, we all died, but I
thought it was great that everybody fought together until the end (but we
all gave the puller a piece of our minds afterwards).
