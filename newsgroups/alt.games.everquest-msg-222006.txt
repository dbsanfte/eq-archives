59 druid as main healer for a ranger tank in HOH, no slower. FT7, POTC,
horse, kei. Given that was fine and my experience of ldon is that ldon
mobs (normal) are trivial compared to pop mobs I see no reason at all
a druid shouldnt be main healer.

>> Is this a case of druids really can't be main healers? Is it their way of

It probably depends on your tank, slows, and druid though. In this case
the druid was twinked (is FT7 unusual?) and the ranger was elementally
geared with maximal defensive AA's. I dont see why an untwinked druid
with an enchanter/beastlord/bard on slows shouldnt be able to heal a 'real' 
tank though.

The cleric thing is more interesting though... unless people are willing
to take pallie rezzes its a pain, or expensive. I've done a mission with
 a necro rezzing for speed and I ended up subbing all the rezzes (I
could afford it, at the time), costing about 2000pp. Was a laugh though ;)
The group was utterly 'suboptimal' ;)
