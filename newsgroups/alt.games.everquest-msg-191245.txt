Heck, even if he were not on a ship, he'd probably be OK.  Look at the
number of casualties compared to the number of people fighting...and it's
nothing like what we used to think of as war.  The Gulf War had something
like 150 deaths on our side, over about 40 days.  Figure the rate is about
1500 per year.  That was with about 500k, so that gives a death rate of
around 300 per 100k per year.  That's only about 3 times the death rate of
that age group at home in peacetime.

Does anyone else find that totally amazing?  Sometimes I think that that
episode of the original Star Trek, where the two planets had made war clean
enough that they didn't bother to end it, and so fought for centuries, was
not as farfetched as it seemed when I first saw it!
