I prefer EQ far and away above DAOC . A few things I liked about DAOC
though. The quest mobs where done oh so much better. If 15 people needed a
quest piece it did not take 6 monthes to get it ,all it took was a battle.
This is so right where EQ does this so wrong.

The downtime never gets ridiculous in DAOC, In EQ it was entirely possible
for it to take a full 30 minutes to completely recover. Nothing like being a
caster without any manarate increasers and having to completely rebuff
yourself 8/ And if you where trying to regen as a tank just forget it. I
think 5 minutes should have been the absolute moist time anyone should ever
have to spend. Reading a book and playing a game at the same time is crazy.

The specialist to generalist ratio was right on . You could be a 50 in one
skill or a 40 in 2. The biggest problems in class balancing in EQ was they
completely forgot this. Specialists are always in high demand when you do
something with many people but with just a few people the generalist should
be prefered. For a long time the semis where completely destroyed by this,
druids and necros still are.
