Pickle.
I would stay away from anything that had MX in the name if you are a high end gamer.
Not sure what your budget is but my Geforce 3 ti200 will get pretty close to the Geforce 4 4200 (non MX) that my brother has so you might find one of them about as cheap as an MX.
My Geforce 3 ti200 would smoke his Geforce 4 MX440 SE (which just blew up a few months ago)

Look at www.newegg.com
or www.pricewatch.com

The Gainward Geforce 4 ti4200 Golden Sample 64 meg DDR is $105 with free shipping.
The Gainward Geforce 3 ti200 Golden Sample 128 meg DDR is $88 with $5 shipping.
(Golden samples rock.. made to overclock from the factory)
Can't go wrong with Newegg either.

Hope this helps.

Jack
