His issue is that it is looking like it is going to take him longer, post
patch, to get to 50 or 51 from where he currently is than it would have
prepatch.  I don't know if this is the case or not, but that is what it is
looking like to him at the moment.  The fact that if he had gotten to 50
prepatch, then started a new character and leveled that character to 50 and
it took the same amount of xp/effort for both is immaterial.  The issue is
whether it is harder for him to finish getting to 50 from where he is now
than it would have been prepatch.
