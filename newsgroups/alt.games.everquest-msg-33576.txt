TWINK?  BWAHHAHA!  I _still_ have 3 pieces of raw silk and 
3 pieces of CLOTH!  It's odd, I didn't think this was atypical,
beleive me, I've died ALOT (probably over 100 times now).
A druid friend of mine hit 30 in 11 days, non twinked, etc, so
this seems to be a fairly good guess at progres rates.
Also, I should note that I haven't been doing any skills or
extra long quests/camps.  Strictly XP grind.  

My personal opinion-
Druids are great, maybe even a little unbalanced (ports, snare,
sow, AND heals???).  But nothing can beat the versatiity of a
Necro.  I have been in groups where I was the healer, enchanter,
nuker, and snare/dotter.  Granted, I can be bested by any cleric,
enchanter, or nuker in those fields, but you see my point.
