Imagine if the LDoN plan was applied to everything.  Its really
sort of a DKP system thats administered by the SOE instead of
your guild, after all.  Instead of worrying about some of the
many problems of DKP though, the loot you want is available
whenever you can afford it, and everyone earns points based on
what they do without having to worry about someone else
outpointing them or outbidding them or getting preferential
treatment from their guild officers... or about rare drop rates.

To make this interesting, you'd want to include lots more sorts
of targets than the 5 that are currently in place, of course. 
But whats to prevent that, heck, make a type of target for every
dungeon or even for every named if you like.  Want Adamantite
Epaulets?  Get in a group that kills the Ghoul Cavalier, and you
are good to go.  Don't want to buy any of his drops?  Its ok, you
can apply those points to buying the Light Burlap Sack, assuming
you've killed the Ghoul Supplier at least once.

I dunno, maybe its not immersive enough, but it seems to me it
would sure take care of a lot of the irritations in the game;
everyone would always be benefitting in loot terms from
everything they do, like they theoretically do for raid time
assuming their guild system is reasonably well run.  And leave a
guild, no problem, your LDoN style points come with you.  New
member to a guild?  No worries, people won't all be outbidding
you because you have the same points as always.
