I have to open a door to enter the local Inn, why shouldn't a mob? Blah, 
blah, yeah I know, possible exploits. How about your entry into the 
structure being refused if you are on a hate list?

As far as any concern about it being a "safe spot" in that scenario goes, 
there are plenty of safe spots in, say, West Commons as it is if I want 
one. Why not make the structures behave as a structure should?

Bah, just one of the many little things that don't make a lot of sense to 
me about EQ.

While I'm on the subject of EQ silliness, how about the fact that the 
newbie armor quests - I'm guessing implemented to throw that new player a 
bone by giving them the opportunity to own gear better than tattered 
leather - are *ridiculously* tedius. They picked one component required for 
a few different pieces of the quest armor and made it an extremely rare 
drop. If they wanted to make things easier on the new player base, they 
failed. Those quests are more likely to turn a new player off on EQ than 
give them a boost. My ranger was able to manage it, but for my untwinked 
warrior, I finally had to bring my second account back for a month just to 
roll up a ranger to track for him. This is all not to mention the fact that 
by the time I have all the quest items I need, I'm camping green mobs to 
get them.

Just a long day of tedium on my day off. Where's the chocolate...and 
beer...in that order, of course. ;)
