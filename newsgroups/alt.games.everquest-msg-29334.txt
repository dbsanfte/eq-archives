To prevent you from being 100+ feet in the air and nuking the mob to 
death without it hitting you. Look at it this way, if he looks up he can 
see you right? Yes, I've gotten the "your target is too far away", but 
he didn't hit me (I knew he was aggrod because he was chasing me). Did 
it hit you?

It's happened to me too.. usually under the bridge in EK. I just move to 
a point where I CAN see it. Why does it happen? I don't know I'm not a 
programmer. Do I think it's a "cheat"? Sure, but I'd rather that than 
the alternative. Did the GM deny you a res on that?

NPCs and characters have what is (I believe) a "hit zone" around them. 
It's kinda like a box for targeting. If you're in the box (or vice 
versa) you can hit. Also, check the range on the weapon. The shorter the 
range the closer you have to be. The "range" on their arms <might> be 
longer than your weapons range.

Get higher and level and it DOES get reversed. I believe it depends on 
whether the mob can be stunned. I'm probably wrong on this. Just my 
theory.

Nope, they DO have a limit on their mana. It may be larger than yours 
but they DEFINATELY have a limit. I've powerleveled some friends against 
the raiders in NK. Eventually the casters DID run out of mana and were 
meleeing exclusively.

Green is an issue of level. It is NOT an issue of power. If nothinge 
else LEARN THAT. Put it this way, some planes mobs are green to level 
60s. Yet one on one those 60s (with a few exceptions) will be a red 
stain on the floor if they attacked them.
