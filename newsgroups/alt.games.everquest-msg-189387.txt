Well, sold those silks.  Had 850 pp burning a hole in my pocket.  Bought
several items.  Unfortunately, I was not very careful.

ALWAYS CHECK FOR DEITY REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING!!!!

I'm now the proud owner of two "Tunare Deity" items that I can't equip.
Spent 400 pp on them.  Sigh ... They are for sale at a slight discount.
After work, the discount will be made less slight, if they have not yet
sold.

Now ... a question.

What is the difference between required equip level and a recommended equip
level?  I realize I cannot equip certain items if they have a required equip
level higher than mine, but what does the "recommended" level mean?

I'm guessing that it means I only get part of the value until I reach the
recommended level, but I don't really know.

TIA
Cheers,
Eric
