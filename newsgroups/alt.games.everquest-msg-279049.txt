Excuse me ,are you really that naive?
Are you really thinking they care about this?
We are talking about the company who released EQ2,well knowing
that would make lots of players switch from EQ1 to EQ2,thus making
it a lot of harder to find groups.

I read with delight  in a German news magazine,that Sony's overall
market share in consumer electronics has diminished from 15% to
10% in the last year,exactly what one would expect from a company
which decides its a good idea to replace 1 great game by 2 average
games.
