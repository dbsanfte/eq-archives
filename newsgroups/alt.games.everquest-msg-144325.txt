Lol.  If only there were any programs besides EQ I ran, where an 
equivalent isn't just as good, that ran on Windows... In many cases, you 
would find that the 'equivalent' on another OS is actually better in some 
finicky technical way you never would have expected to matter.  But then, 
I obsess about these things too much. :)  Fortunately, I have access to a 
variety of different computers, so I can always move the file to where the 
really spiffy file-manipulation tool is. :)

Skip Mac, though.  This keyboard bites.  Been using it nigh on 3 months 
now, and it still screws me up.  And the mouse doesn't have enough 
buttons, and the menu bars are all in the wrong place. :)
