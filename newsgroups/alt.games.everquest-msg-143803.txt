Find a RL friend who plays EQ and has the SOL expansion.
Go over to his house, log on your character, and go to the
bazaar.

The bazaar is far far better than auctions ever was, and it
has killed auction zones off to near nonexistance.

It would also be possible to hire someone to go shopping for
you... or get a friend to do it, more likely, since you need someone
you can trust and who is willing to go out of his way for you.

You could also try the auction channel on your server, since
MQs and containers and services can't be put in bazaar mode,
they do still survive.  If you auction to buy things you might
find enterprising people willing to pick them up in bazaar
and bring them to you for a markup...
