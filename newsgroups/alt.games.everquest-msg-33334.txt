I know my guild around 1 year ago made a fun event on one of the PvP servers.
Someone had a druid with porting capability, and then everyone in guild made a
new char on that server, or used the one they already had, then mass-ported to
BB, ran to GFay and all got bound there, and then charged Kelethin, and had
great fun with 20 newbie trolls running around in the newbie area and batteling
wood elves.
