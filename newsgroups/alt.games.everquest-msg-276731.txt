If (exercise equipment exists to make someone a great goalie) then (person
who uses equip should be allowed to compete).

Unfortunately said equipment does not and can not exist, because it's not
exercise that makes a great goalie, although great goalies have to exercise.
So the argument falls down at that point. Money doesn't buy you skill, and
if it is used so that the rules of the game are altered, then that is called
corruption. The equivalent in your analogy would be bribing the ref so he
pretends the "great goalie" really can deflect a ball, despite all evidence
to the contrary.
