Why on earth does it matter where the port is to if you are being paid to do
the port.  It takes no more time for you to port someone to WC from Freeport
than it does to port them to GD or CS.  If you are willing to port for a
fee, what difference does it make if the port is a short hop, or across the
world?  If you are not willing to port for a fee, then, again, what
difference does it make, you aren't doing it anyway.
