Med rate is a constant mana points per tic, based
on several factors:

Are you sitting or standing at the instant the tic hits?

Your meditation skill

Nothing, Breeze, Clarity, or Clarity 2?  (or Death Pact
or Allure of Death or Lich or... I forget)

Nothing, Flowing Thought 1, Flowing Thought 2?

If your fatigue bar is at zero your mana replentishment will drop -waaaay- off

Thats it.

Manasong, by the way, does -not- effect meditation.  Instead, each time
the song pulses, you get a boost to your current mana.  You can have up
to five bards all hitting you with manasong, along with flowing thought 2,
clarity 2, and a maxed out meditation skill... hmm, and you could be a
shaman, and be using cannabalize III, which also runs independantly of
meditation.  Oh, and you could also be eating Mod Rods, although I'm
not sure that would make sense if you had cannabalize.  And of course
any number of necros up to whatever level would crash the zone could
be pumping mana into you.
