Oh my,casting a spell so as to practice a casting skill and get kill 
credit while being PLed?  Gosh, I wish I'd thought of that cunning 
plan.  No need to cast Choke, though, how about Shallow Breath, which is 
cheaper and works your alteration skill just as well per cast (better, 
less fizzles).  Or Chaotic Feedback, which would work evocation.  Or 
just turn melee on and cast whatever you like, swinging weapon in 
between to do damage.

Point is, while you are being PLed you do indeed need to do at least one 
point of damage per mob, but other than that, your time is pretty much 
available to chain cast low level crap to raise skills instead of going 
to POK to do it like a non PL'ed chanter will probably have to.

Choke cast time 2.25.  Chaotic Feedback cast time 2.1.  Hmm, even if 
there was a significant difference in these two cast times that would 
make a massive difference in your ability to get them out while being 
beat on... the shorter cast time item is the nuke!  Now thats a bit of a 
clay pigeon, since I already advised using Shallow Breath instead, this 
has a cast time of only 1.5.  I don't think you'll see much difference 
in ability to channel a 1.5 versus a 2.1 either, but at least it leans 
the direction you were thinking of.  However the biggest difference is 
between choke and shallow breath, and -you- voted in favor of choke, 
meaning you weren't really favoring quick cast time all that much anyway.

Also, I already noted that evocation is probably the least important of 
chanter skills, so working on it would be the lowest priority item.

But it would also be counterproductive, the point of porcupining is to 
get hit, so slowing or stunning the mob just extends its life span and 
lessens the efficiency of the DS.  Remember too that the PLers in 
question are only 24ish themselves as far as I can see, so mana 
efficiency becomes a significant question as the PL victim approaches 
their level; keeping DS and heals going on the chanter while she speed 
levels is a non trivial exercise and having the chanter slow things down 
isn't going to endear them to whoever is giving the advice.

Who me?  The guy who takes every character to GD and EW at level 24 to 
see how they stack up against the red but killable targets there?  The 
guy who heard nothing but complaints about going into POP zones at 46 
instead of waiting till 56?  I don't push? 

If you line up the nearest ten guys against the wall and shoot the ones 
that won't take risks in the head, I bet I'm the first to die... because 
I rushed the fire team and tried to kill them with my shoelace rather 
than stand passively against the wall hoping I'd be counted a risk taker.

Mez is an amusing toy for the under 20 set, since the players can be 
relied on to refuse to use assist or stop trying to pull mobs off you.  
Soloing, its also an amusing toy, since single pulling mobs that you can 
kill is a trivial exercise... in particular, the fact that the Lull line 
is now functional (and doesn't my cleric just roll over in his grave 
every time he sees it work, thinking how useful it would have been in 
-his- early career).  Mez doesn't become vital until you stop pulling 
for yourself and let the people who are bad at it do the work, which 
results in overpulls.  When should you do this?  When the damage you'll 
take from the pulls starts to add up to significant risk or heal time.  
When's that?  Over 20!

To date (level 30) I've yet to see any use for the 48 second mez, the 
low level one casts faster for less mana and given only 8 slots, picking 
a second mez means the AE one which gives me massively better chances of 
controlling overpulls in a hurry.  I can recast the short mez easily 
enough if there's a mob or two that needs parking, recast the AE one if 
there's a cluster that needs parking.  Plus Root works well for belt and 
suspenders CC, while having 3 mezzes memmed doesn't; its better to have 
things set up so if mez breaks the mob is rooted and if root breaks the 
mob is mezed, if it has to sit for a bit.  Eventually I'll have to move 
to longer mez because fights tend to get longer and longer, and I'll 
need to park mobs for longer periods without having to keep standing up 
and recasting; thats still rare enough currently that I don't worry 
about it.

Mind you, thats level 30 fighting with a group of 40 to 45 in DL.  So 
don't tell me its cause I'm going after low blues that are easy to 
control or that die ultra fast.

If I want the mob slowed ASAP, I pull with... wait for it.... slow.  
Just as if I'm hungry, I eat instead of planting the seeds and waiting 
for the corn to grow.  I said 24+ because its roughly at that point that 
yellow mobs start resisting on more than a couple times per hour rate.  
I also said if you are grouping with higher level friends... because if 
you are 12 but grouped with 18s and killing stuff thats quite red to 
you, yes, you are indeed going to end up using the tash line earlier.

Pull with a DOT or nuke?  I can't imagine why you'd want to do that, 
pull with something that causes more adds, doesn't have any relevance to 
the important task of getting the mobs slowed, and in the case of the 
DOT prevents mez if you really screwed up?  Or the nuke, as we discussed 
earlier, your least important spell line and your worst damage per mana 
ratio in one shot?

Mmm.  Its because unlike chanters, shaman have excellent mana flow and 
can easily afford to haste everything that moves.  Your druid vaguely 
resembles a ranger, ranger need haste, rather than bother checking your 
class, what the heck, haste you too.  Chanter, on the other hand, 
watches to see who is meleeing and who isnt', and strongly considers 
memming a cheaper haste for the less effective melee'rs, or heck, 
skipping the puller entirely if he's spending more time pulling while 
the others kill than not, because mana is at a premium... at least till 
29, at which point longer duration haste, clarity, and the lack of 
anything useful to do means he too can haste everything without thinking 
about it, but by now he's learned mana discipline on hastes so he doesn't.

Your theory is a good one too, though, assuming you are in your high 50s 
or better so you actually finally have a better heal than the shaman 
does (I was jealous too until yesterday, when I looked it up and 
discovered you have the same heals as a shaman at the same levels thru 
at least 51... maybe they just haven't done the research and -thought- 
you had 1337 healing powahz?)

While there is a secret united front of clerics and enchanters, paladins 
thus far don't seem to be in on the skinny.  That said, there's a 
paucity of grouping opportunities of any sort for the under 50 set these 
days, many of the people you see those levels are in guild groups or 
teamed up with friends or PLing themselves with bots, the "free range" 
lowbies are in shorter and shorter supply, one reason I end up 
gravitating to the classic "sweet spots" for play is that despite the 
fact that I've "been there done that", if I want to explore grouping 
instead of soloing, best odds by far say I go to those zones.  Even 
there, my groups -often- are decidedly nonstandard, lacking a real tank, 
or a real healer, or real DPS or...well whatever I'm not playing, 
there's a good chance we won't find someone available in that role for 
quite a while.

As you see from responses to your post here, Whirl is an interesting 
toy.  At low levels, I found it quite useful in holding mobs still like 
a real stun while my pet killed them.  The breakable nature of the spell 
means that as you level up it becomes less and less useful for that 
purpose, but even now I still find it handy for stopping runners while 
soloing; oddly, runners don't seem to break it nearly as easily as 
fighting mobs, despite the lack of any change in melee composition (yep, 
just my hasted pet same as before)

But while Whirl is a toy, the PB AE Stuns are highly useful, if 
situational, tools for soloing and grouping, for one target or six, for 
overpulls and deliberate pulls, for interrupting spells and for creating 
additional slow like effects to save healing mana (or when tanking for 
your pet, just to save HP).  Learning the range, cycle time, cast time, 
and duration of these spells is another strong arguement for -not- PLing 
up really fast; like Slow, this would be a line where you might want to 
take a break from PL and learn on easier mobs.

Assuming you mean that the group of 5 who are currently 24 and want the 
newbie to join them aren't friends because they might want to do that 
instead of all starting over at level 1... I suppose you may have a 
point, but as you know, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the 
one.  These people each have more time and dedication invested in their 
current mains than does the newbie, plus you have to add them all 
together.  Say it takes two weeks to level her up "honestly".  You are 
asking for 10 man/weeks of play time out of the friends, versus five man 
days if they all participate in the PLing effort (and really, more like 
one man/day, since I don't think it would actually take a full day if 
you had all 5 helping)

I'm trying to take that into consideration.  Note that I said 90% were 
as useless as a PLed-to-24 chanter, and yet only 70% were more clueless 
than the people I used to play with...

What amazes me is that so many of the people out there now are 
twinks/alts like me, so I expect them to be applying lessons learned in 
past lives, but no, give them a different class and they to revert 
almost entirely to their default cluelessness.
