Wow I never knew how much damage the pet's DS did! I never use the fire 
pet due to it having the least HP of all the pets, and it doing the same 
damage as the water pet anyway. I do have the level 39 and 44 fire pets 
though plus I've done all the pet focus item quests so with the focus 
item I can summon a fire pet with the same HP as the air pet without the 
focus item.

Yes I always pull with malise, and if they resist I cast it until it 
sticks, then DD away. Usually after a malise they don't resist.

I found that taking on the lower blue cons was less efficient because I 
still used a lot of mana, but gained a lot less XP. Perhaps using the 
fire pet I won't have to use as much mana since the pet's DS is doing so 
much more damage. I'll give it a try. Thanks for the tip.
