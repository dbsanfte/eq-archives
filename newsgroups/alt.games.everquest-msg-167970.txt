A simple partial refutation:

1) Your sample rules would be horribly unfair except where all classes
were totally balanced for solo PvP.
2) Even if you did manage to balance dissimilar classes, if a
patch/update caused a balance issue it would be hugely exploited.
3) Extending your example to a multi-player environment with multiple
groups and individuals involved in overlapping combat would be, to say
the least, a nightmare.

I really don't see how anything even remotely similar to what you
suggest could be made workable for a class-based ruleset.  And I'm
not at all confident that you could do it in a classless system
unless there were only a very few mutually exclusive factions.
