I'm just thinking from the viewpoint that we've got plenty of idea

Usenet, I'm just trying to plant the seeds of creativity and

Re: "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
EXACTLY!  The "timed spell" approach is so deeply integrated
into so many games that considering a fresh approach is, at
worst, an interesting intellectual exercise!  It's such a shame
to short-circuit it before it even gets started.

: Yes I saw that one, interesting in a way, but doesn't handle the
: LD part,

I think I would handle LD like zoning and drop the buffs (or convert
the spells to timed spells).  Raid folks can always just go straight
for the timed ones to avoid LD problems.

Okay, this is more of a problem...and a very good point!  Now...
How might this be fixed?  Time to be constructive!

Here's some space for your ideas on getting around that problem:






(evil grin)

: You didn't NOT suggest it either.  But a duplicate line of spells
: would go a long way to alleviating some of the drawbacks of your

<agree> :) </agree>

: Sure it is, you don't know in advance that they are going to LD. 
: But your suggesting of them reverting to the timed version would
: take care of that to some extent; then you wouldn't have to know
: in advance after all.

<agree> :) </agree>

: Utility would be much higher if you could click them off
: individually.  But now thats another 18+ slot window, with icons
: and names for each slot (DS on Ralph, Regen on Ralph, Regen on
: Bearash, etc.)

Hmmm....perhaps have a single "target buff" window that changes when
you select a different target?  That would reduce the UI real estate
necessary quite a bit....

Any other ideas on that one?  It's a sticky UI issue...  there must
be some solutions...

: No no, its err drastically on the side of the players, leave it
: that way for a week, then patch it drastically in the opposite
: direction so its pretty much worthless for all intents and
: purposes, leave it that way for a year, patch back to too good to
: be true, leave up for two hours, patch back to worse than ever,
: leave up for 6 weeks... clearly you don't work in the gaming

LOL!

That reminds me of the plight of the poor monks......still nerfed
beyond any good sense.......or so my monk friends tell me.  It
seems all they really have going for them these days is Feign Death.

: I did make several suggestions already, such as the Off Switch
: idea, the "limit to group" idea, the fact that you could just run
: a bard if you want things to work that way...

I like your suggestions.  I bet most of those were off the top of
your head too.  I bet you could conjure up some real gold if you
put your mind to it.  (Transparent psychological manipulation but
what the hey.)

Bards though.....way too much work.  Blechy-poo.  Where's my "level
my character to 45" button anyway???  :)

: But here's another for you.  Make it so bards don't have to
: overlap and constantly twist songs, just have 5 slots that they
: can leave running at the same time, or click off to change song
: or retarget.  Leaves out the Carpal Tunnel balancing plan, of
: course, but it would be pretty close to what you seem to be
: describing at this point.

I would be the first in line to try the bard class if SOE did that!
