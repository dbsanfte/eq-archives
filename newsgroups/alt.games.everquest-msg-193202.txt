You used it in a specific context that is far different from the
"generally known".  But hey, if you don't feel that you have to
provide any useful information content in your posts that's your
business.

rofl.  In other words you're saying:  "Hey I'm just spewing bullshit,
it's up to the reader to invent any meaning to be attached to my
words, because I sure as hell can't be bothered to actually say
anything intelligent or meaningful."

If you had stopped at "i don't think" you would have actually provided
useful information there, although I will admit that it's not difficult
to infer that from your post taken as a whole.
