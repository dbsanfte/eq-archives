No she didn't. I'll take a stab at it, however.  Matt puts "go away 
moron" into a lot of his posts.  Personally, I find it annoying as 
hell.  But its part of a post, and usually a response to something.  
This doesn't make it enjoyable in the least.  Don't get me wrong.  
However, its not spamming.  He can make "go away moron" his sig. (Dear 
God, I never said that Matt) 

What "what's his name" was doing was JUST spamming. "Dark Tygar is an 
idiot" was the entirety of every post.  It really wouldn't have made a 
difference if he was posting a reply in every thread that said "Milk 
is good for your teeth".

I don't know there Sword.  Tattling in itself is not always bad.  If 
someone breaks into my house, if I call the cops am I tattling?  I do 
agree with the second part of your statement there though.  The whole 
bragging about getting a spammers plug pulled thing... is so ick.
