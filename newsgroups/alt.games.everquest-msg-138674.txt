But the pelts are easier to come by than the runner's pouch.  Yes,
neither is completely trivial, but I'd go more in the direction of
400pp pelt, 600pp pouch (assuming you could sell pouch)

Too, Kpp is just silly for something this easy to get.  Realistically,
it should be valued at 400pp, or around 150 for the pelt, 200
for the pouch, and 100 for doing the leg work.  Somehow that
seems low for something this nice, though.
