Yup - me too. My system used to be the picture of stability, but now I keep
getting this "do you want to report" screen popping up under the game and
within 30 seconds the game crashing. I would bet by left nut this new report
screen is what is causing the crash in the first place. Who can remember
that crappy Nortons program: "Crashguard" that used to be popular. Put it on
a stable system then it starts bitching at you every half hour about how it
saved you from a crash - and  locks up whatever program you are using in the
process...
