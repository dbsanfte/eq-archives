Ahh, but that's precisely the point i was trying to make.  The whistling
actually *was* offensive to a small degree, but the passerby was willing
to ignore it once.

Xocyll, however, claims that the behavior-formerly-known-as-killstealing
is completely acceptable; that it is not offensive in the least.  And if
that is the case, I don't understand how merely repeating it a few times
puts in in the category of "harassment."

Unless just following someone around is the real harassment, and the
killstealing was irrelevant.
