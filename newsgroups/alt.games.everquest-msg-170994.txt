	I bowkited.  You can bowkite in the teens, though you'll probably want to
bum a SoW.

	I did spend a long time at level 22 in WC, taking time out of levelling to
hunt spiders for silks for Tailoring.  During that time I tracked and bowkited
more Werewolves than I care to remember, which is where I picked up a lot of
Archery points.  The skill didn't cap (pre-50) until level 45.  Past 50 I
didn't have much trouble keeping it capped.
