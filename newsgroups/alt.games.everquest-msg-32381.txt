<snip lots of good info>
in response, i write :

the guy you're referring to, myself, did in fact take your adivce,
nail-on-the-head as it was, and fix the file . . .

however, when i started getting parsing errors with my logs again 2 weeks
ago, i checked the logs and found everything peachy-keen



yet, i can't parse !


i restarted fresh .txt files and named them identically to the originals
(and moved the originals to a far-off folder ) . . .

yet, i can't parse !


the best part is that my main, a char fighting in kunark (doubt that
matters) can parse fine ( so no rush, i mean . . . corrupt files are ranger
[ why the hell would i play a ranger anyway? hybrids ROT] and a wizard [who
cares what skills are at, i only do evocation], so i'm not really feeling
the pressure to fix anything)

thanks

(reply other ideas, or i'll just send a zipped wizard log file for your
entertainment)
