My bard got gunned down by zombie guards while trying to cross kithicor
during the day (while "haloween" was going on). I couldnt get to the body
with either my bard or my druid, and eventually ended up doing a cr with my
necro. Happened to be night time when I did it, but it didnt matter realy. I
must have got in agro range of at least 10 undead doing that cr, but none of
them saw through ivu.

Last time I crossed kithicor during the day, I couldnt track any of those
undead, so it must have been a special haloween event in kithicor. (thanks
verant for a totally pointless death)

Having said that, there are things in kithicor that will agro you with ivu.
"Dire wolves" (i think thats the spelling) dont count as undead and are
quite nasty. Theres also a lot of rather nasty dark elves (red at 55), but
stick to the zone walls and you will avoid them (they dont wander)

The whole idea of making kithicor dangerous would sit a lot beter with me if
you could "go around" kithicor, but with the zone system this means feroot
and RM whih is just plain stupid. Verant have basically used a limitation of
their software (zones) as a tool to make things hard for us. Then theres all
the buffs that drop when you zone, and specific debuffs like levi in the
hole. Sad, truly sad.
