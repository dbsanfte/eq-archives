If you don't go to the moon there's no need to upgrade.
If you do go but have most models turned off, and social animations turned
off, there's no rush to upgrade.

I upgraded from a GF2MX400 to a GF4-4200-128 and found that I could have all
models on...social animations on...except in the worst zones (bazaar, shar
vahl).  I still had to kill particle density during raids though...and I
still do, even with the new effects (though "far" works ok so far).
