I suggest Kaesora.  Easy to get there via the Cab book.  Go in and clear 
the east side of the dungeon and down the the Library, then head down to 
Xalgoz, then fight your way out.  If you have a ton of people there, it 
will be trivial, but if you are talking 6-10 people, it will be a good 
training ground without a lot of danger.  If you happen to pull all of 
Xalgoz's temple at once, be prepared to do some crowd control.  If none of 
you know the dungeon, then it's a fun place to explore.  There are a couple 
class-specific drops that are pretty much considered crap these days, but 
they aren't that bad.  There's also a caster book that drops in the 
library.  One of the bard coins drops here, too.

You can also try City of Mist.  It's a little harder, level-wise.  If you 
have a rogue with 200+ pick lock, it can even be more fun by taking on a 
Black Reaver or 2.  There seem to be a lot of Shammy quest drops in this 
zone, and a few rare weapons drops that aren't too bad.  If you do take on 
the Black Reavers, make sure you all have Evac because you may start a 
chain that you will eventually not be able to handle, and running to the 
zone isn't trivial if it has all repopped behind you.  There's also another 
bard coin drop here.

I've only been to Chardok once, but the stuff near the front was blue to me 
at 50 ( as opposed to Red further in near the Royals ).  Maybe that is a 
good place and will give you a hint of the zone for when you start epic 
hunting.

If you want to clear a dungeon for the fun of it, go to Dalnir.  For the 
30's, I think they will see light blues to red.  I think it's a blast to go 
into a dungeon and clear it from the front to the back.  If you do Dalnir, 
then Kaesora, then CoM, it will give your lowers ( 30+ ) chars information 
on good EXP places.

I'm not big on outside zones, but I'm sure there are a lot that will suit 
you, but they just aren't as fun.  It's no fun to have a "Raid" where all 
you do is sit in the outdoors and have your puller pull mobs to the mass of 
players.  It's more fun learning a zone you've never been to and that 
others can EXP in later.

How about Kithicor at night?  Break your raid up into groups of mixed 
levels and as soon as the nighttime mobs start popping, see which group can 
kill the most undead before they are all gone - as long as they are undead, 
they count, except for their pets.  When the day comes, have a drunken 
Bixie hunt and see who can collect the most wings, honeycombs, etc.

I'm just making shit up now, so I'll stop.
