It's a driver problem. If you are using any of the catalyst drivers
except the 2.4 you will have problems. The 2.5 catalyst drivers are
screwed (I had to uninstall them). The 2.4 Catalyst works OK for me
(knock on wood) but I may just be lucky.

If push comes to shove go back to pre-catalyst drivers (one's dated in
apr or may like 9031 or something) and that should fix your problem.
