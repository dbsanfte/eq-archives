I bet all your friends just love how you are a Mr. Know It All, lol.  I am
indeed a 53 Druid and not a twink or an ebayer.  Go count how many times as
a Druid I "had" to go to FV to get a spell.  I don't like Kunark and I don't
like the Luclin zones (gonna have to learn to love Umbral soon though - want
that elysian stuff badly).  But even dropping the moon and Kunark left me
plenty of places to go.  Let me ask you Mr. Know It All - How is your CoV
faction?  Do you have the Coldain Prayer Shawl #7 yet?  I am Amiable to to
CoV and yes I have the seventh shawl.  Bah, I sneer at Kunark.

BTW, I ran to FV last night bougt the 51 to 55 spells from the NPC - was
indeed easy.  I wont be back to FV again until level 55 or later if the 55
spells don't set me on fire.
