No, they last longer than that. I seem to recall way back when I first
went to 60 I went there after Skyfire, which would have been around
53, and they were all dark blue, or very close to it. Granted that was
before light blue even entered the game, but I don't think light blue
covers THAT much.

Stayed there until 57, other than groups in Sebilis.

At 47 I think I was doing a certain ruin in BW, that was good exp.
