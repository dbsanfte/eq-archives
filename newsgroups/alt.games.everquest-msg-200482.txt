Wait till you get to level 39.  The charm upgrade makes charm kiting
significantly easier because it lasts a minute.

Bard's charm has been one of the most reliable songs for me.  At level
34 I was able to use the level 27 charm on mobs that conned yellow and
red.  It was not resisted often.  Charm kiting with the level 27 song
is much more difficult than the level 39 song.
