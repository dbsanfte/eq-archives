The trigger is the first mino slaver that spawns in the tunnel (right at the
first small turn) .. random chance that when you kill him, the Hero will
spawn on the mountain across from the tunnel entrance (can just barely see
him from the tunnel .. he runs towards the big gears) ..

He's kinda fast, around level 35, and hits for 90's i think. Not too many
hps, though.
