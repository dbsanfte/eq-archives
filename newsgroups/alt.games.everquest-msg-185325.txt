I have a Lvl 50  Human Enchanter and apparently we are as different as
Erudites and Human.  I think decided upon a spell line up depends greatly on
who you are hunting with and what you are hunting.  My main partner is a 46
Necromancer, so my usual line up goes something like this:

Slot 1:  Discordant Mind..Love the power of that one.

Slot 2: Dazzle

Slot 3: Mesmersation

Slot 4: Tash

Slots 5-7 Swaps..Usually keep my variety of debuffs/buffs here

Slot 8: Clarity..swap out for Brilliance and Gift of Magic.

Also, I have be known to keep me gate spell memmed in there somewhere..I
call it my Enchanter Evac.  While a necromancer can feign death, I have no
other option to get out of a fight gone bad other than to gate out.  It has
saved my chanter backside many times.  Also, it is always in there when I am
soloing.

In a group, I will keep my Grasping Embrace in slot 3.  In my normal guild
group, it is almost the only fight spell I have to cast.  If a mob is a
little tougher than usually, I will just nuke them with Discordant Mind.

Just my 2pp worth..I live in an inflated world.
