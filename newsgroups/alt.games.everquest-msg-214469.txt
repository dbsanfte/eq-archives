EQ actually is quite a lot more diverse than AC for character development.
In the long run in AC there are just 3 classes, Melee ( regardless of weapon
your using ), Mage, and Archer.  In the Highend game effective mages ( those
that can effectively group or Solo in places like VoD ) are going to either
be Battle Mages ( Life/War Specc'd ), with a few other next to meaningless
skills such as healing or lockpikc, or leadership, or Battle Og's (
Life/War/Critter Spec'd ) with fewer meaningless skills. Archers are almost
cookie cutter now. You MUST spec Archery, you must at least Train Melee D,
and you must at least train Life magic, or preferrably Spec it to be
effective at the high end. Melee's are much the same. There are some Minor
Variations but they really arent significant.
So the diversity factor really isnt an issue comparing AC to EQ.

As far as things to do OTHER than kill/loot/sell/repeat EQ has got that in
spades over AC. The whole tradeskill system is simply amazing. Tradeskills
that produce REAL USEFULL items as opposed to the mildly usefull Hearty
Healing Hot Kimchi, or other cooking novelties that I found were the only
real usefull tradeskill items in AC.

The list goes on and on for me on why EQ is a better, richer game than AC at
this time, but Ill not bore you with a long droawn out post. If you have
specific questions or areas that you want to compare I'd be happy to answer
them here for you.

Oh... and this isnt coming from a "never played AC" person either. PLayed AC
since 1 week after retail up until about 3 months ago. Have several
character that were up into thier 90's. In the end budget constraints forced
me to pick one game or ther other, and I picked EQ, and havent regretted it
once.
