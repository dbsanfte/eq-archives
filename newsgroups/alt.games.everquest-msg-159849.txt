QUOTE

"Multiplayer online role-playing games have taken the US by storm and they
are about to hit Europe."

There was a joke about the Soviets being so far behind the west that they
were dancing to the Beegees disco music well into the mid nineties. The BBC
seems to be just as out-of-date. On the EQLoft forums a great many European
players claimed to have been playing for 1-3 years already. Other MMORPG's
have already hit Europe. The BBC spends too much time developing period
dramas set 80-200 years ago, and not enough time developing decent progammes
about the Video/Computer games business.

"My Impression of the BBC was that is was a typical state owned quango short
on accountability and creativity, long on excess and stuffed with 'yes'
people who were unfettered by the need to make an honest profit." Patrick
Augustus.  Quoted from an article in the Daily Mail.
