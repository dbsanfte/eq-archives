Lets take a look at this, the early days Verant creates the Manastone after
awhile they discover the players can drain health for mana and cast a heal
or be healed results Manastone is too powerful Nerfed Manastone.

Rubicite Armor at its time very good looks awesome and regen abilities Wow,
results Cazic-Thule over camped KSing Armor causing problems Nerfed Rubicite
Armor.

Allowing someone to loot your corpse when given consent results players
being ripped off Nerf can only drag Corpse ( no complaint should have been
done from the start ).

Call of the Hero spell to summon a Group member to your location results
players are using this to bypass mobs to get to camp sites, Nerf spell will
not work in higher level zones

Summon Corpse spell summons corpse to your location, results player dies has
corpse dragged to the camp site gets rezzed to bypass mobs Nerf in higher
zones you can only summon corpse to entrance.

Manaburn does a very large amount of damage in one irresistible blast with
low to no Agro results 6 Wizards group and can take down any mob in the game
in 10 seconds Nerf mob can only be hit once a minute with manaburn.

You would think the people that come up with this stuff should at least play
the game and think past their nose on what going to be done. How much
intelligents does it take to think what's going to be done with an Item or
Spell. They give you something then Nerf it because the players are using
it.
