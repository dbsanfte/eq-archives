Aye, because of the policies -- or lack thereof, of the selfish pukesome
morons "in charge" in their worse - off nations. Warmongering common
bandits, who care for nothing save killing weaker people and taking what
they have no right to take; and paranoid fools who convinced themselves that
condoms were bwana's way of committing genocide on them. And so they commit
genocide upon themselves. Let them die; then hopefully someone with some
sense can go in and save the children that are left.
