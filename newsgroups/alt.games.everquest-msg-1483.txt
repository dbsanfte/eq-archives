Buying spells for a necro can be a tricky thing, as we are KOS to so
many things. My necro is a DE and I can buy things in the Freeport
sewers as well as in neriak, the ogre and troll cities. Sometimes I
have had to have friends buy me other spells if I couldnt find them.
Other races are sometimes the only way, besides research skill, to
find some spells, i.e. the Banshee aura spell sells in the overthere
in kunark and the 20th level pet I bought from the Ogre Shadowknights
guild. Best advice is to either make some friends or create a
character that is not KOS to the guild you need to buy from. I have a
level 1 Human enchanter with high charisma just for that purpose.
As to your other questions, the vendors selection is basically the
same with the exception if someone sells something to the vendors it
will often show up to sell to someone else. I bought the gate spell
from the mages guild in freeport with my enchanter. You can also 'con'
outside of the agro range of most creatures.
Good Luck
