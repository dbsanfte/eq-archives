That's the thing that most of these posters overlook. They are disappointed 
that they can't create pristine on demand, but if you ask them how they're 
using their buffs they'll usually say "Huh"? As a level 24 Alchemist, I have 
all 9 of my chemistry buffs up all the time and I know what each of them 
does and how to use them in the various situations that arise. It doesn't 
guarantee me pristines 100% of the time, but enough of it to know that my 
skill as a crafter is a significant part of my competitive advantage. It's a 
challenging system and I like it just fine that way.
