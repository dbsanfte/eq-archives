Except that for rescue you can track the target from start (or as soon as
you get within tracking distance) so you dont make any wrong turns.  Cant do
that with assassinate so you do lose some time if you are forced to guess
which path he will be on and guess wrong.  Maps have target marked but are
wrong as often as they are right since boss mob spawn point is not always
the same spot.
