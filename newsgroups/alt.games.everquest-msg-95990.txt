It is done the same way that you move macros to the hotkey bank.  Move the 
pointer over the gem or item/armor slot, then click and hold.  The icon 
will appear on your cursor, move it to the hotkey bank and drop it in.  
For spells it gives you the ability to use a single keystroke to cast that 
spell.  In this case the SK can cast the first spell (looks like a debuff) 
by just hitting 1.  He can cast his second spell (str steal or something) 
by hitting 2.  He can hit his third spell (probably a lifetap of some 
sort) by hitting 3.  He can HT by hitting 4.  He probably has a 
right-click effect on his arm-piece, and by hitting 5 he triggers it.  The 
taunt key is pretty obvious.  :) 
Really, it's just about not having to use the mouse or any 2-key 
combination to cast spells or use the right-click effect of armor and 
gear.
Oh, one other reason to have equipment (and inventory slots) hotkeyed is 
to make swapping gear out much easier.  This is generally only used by 
bards (and tanks with procing weapons).
