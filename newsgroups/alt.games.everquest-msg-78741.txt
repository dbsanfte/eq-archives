=)  I'm a Gnome underneath that ugly robe, although some people make me 
turn evil with their actions.  I do switch to DE form to confuse people 
sometimes when I slaughter a few wandering guards in Nek.

Along those lines, I conned the Merchants in S. Ro last night.  Dubious.  I 
switch to DE form.  Dubious.  I cast benevolence on them.  Dubious.

They wouldn't deal with me =(
