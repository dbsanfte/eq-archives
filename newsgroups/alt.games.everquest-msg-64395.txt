  Actually, it looks like the picture that is emerging that it may not be
patch server congestion afterall (or, at least, that the congestion isn't
the ONLY problem).  See:
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/009396.html ... he
seems to be under the impression that we're having problems because we've
got dated video cards and aren't using DX8.1.  Why my video card and DX
version would matter when running what should be a relatively undemanding
patching program is beyond me, but that's part of what Verant apparently
suspects is the problem.

  And obviously, somebody (Verant) didn't expect this magnitude of
"clogging" (if that indeed is what the problem is) or else they would've
preemptively purchased those new servers instead of scrambling to bring them
up today.
