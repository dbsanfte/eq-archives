I have an odd yen to get a pet skunk.  Actually I used to live
part of each year in a sort of camping cabin which had skunks in
it, and found them amazingly friendly and fun to hang out with...
but they weren't pets, they were wild and they weren't living in
my house, I was in theirs (they lived there all year round, I was
only there for 2 months a year).  And the one year that a dog
tried to get in and messed with them, they defended the place a
little more thoroughly than I would have liked...

At any rate, I've avoided the urge to get one because I thought
pet skunks were captured wild.. and also because I didn't want to
de-scent them, similar to wanting to not declaw cats and so
forth.  

Just recently, though, I saw something on Animal Planet and they
showed a lady who owns several pet skunks, apparantly they are
bred and raised in captivity, de-scented shortly after birth and
so forth.  

Now I'm in a quandry, are they being mistreated by being
descented, or is it just a norm of domestication, that all pet
skunks are descented and so were their parents and their parents
parents?
