If you divide these up, it makes it quite a bit easier to read.

Anyways, yes, the haste is constant.   FBSS is 21% haste, IIRC.

Item haste will stack with spell haste (enchanter/shaman buffs and bard song)
but will not stack with other haste items.


Also, there is an upper limit for the total amount of haste a character can
have at one time.   I don't remember exactly what it is though.
