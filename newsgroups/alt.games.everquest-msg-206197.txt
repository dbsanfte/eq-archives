Given that this page includes the line "I still need information on levels above
50" and doesn't list what mobs are cyan as opposed to blue, its clearly pretty
desperately out of date.  The requested chart is there, right up top, so its a
decent reference I guess, but personally I'd have snipped out the relevant chart
instead:

+4, ally
+3, warmly
+2, kindly
+1, amiably
0, indifferently
-1, apprehensively
-2, dubiously
-3, threateningly
-4, ready to attack
