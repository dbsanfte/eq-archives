It wasn't Graem actually, it was Geaefaxe (Did iI spell that right?). 
And how can you say that? He's against people being able to defend
themselves. He implied that when he stated that he's opposed to the
SINGLE most effective means of self defense. If a 6'2" 250 lb man came
into his mother's house with intent to rape her, how could she fight
him off? The police can take up to 30 minutes to respond to a 911
call, and that's assuming she could get to the phone before he got
ahold of her. She isn't going to be able to fend him off. Even if
she's a blackbelf in Tai Kwan Do, her chances are still a little less
than even, just because of the size/weight issue. And if she has a
baseball bat or a knife, he's most likely going to take it away from
her and use it on her. These are statistic FACTS. The FACT is that a
woman defending herself with a firearm is 2.5 times less likely to be
harmed than one who's passive. A woman defending herself by ANY OTHER
MEANS is 4 times MORE likely to be harmed than if she's passive. (John
Lott)

By definition, a law abiding citizen becomes a criminal when he uses
force against another for anything other than self defense. Doesn't
happen very often. And if those around him are armed, he's far less
likely to be able to inflict damage. 

Do you have any idea how easy it is to get a gun? A criminal can get a
gun in Gunfree england in a matter of a day or so, and will pay less
money than I did over here for the same gun! ANYONE who has $200 can
have a gun, no questions asked. But you have to do 1 thing. Break the
law.

But climbing steadily. Not a large gang culture up there, and farr
less overpopulation. Yet their murder rate and violent crimes rate has
been climbing steadily since the gunlaws were enacted. Same with
England.

Actually READ some of this snd clear the Michael Moore lies from your
head.

Wrong again. 

>Watch 'Bowling for Columbine' its a nice documentary/movie on the 

No, it;s a piece of shit written by a known liar. Michael Moore is one
of the most demented people known to man. I didn't realize I was
speaking to someone who was so morally bankrupt as to bring that sad
little commuinist up.

Check it out and feel free to argue any assertations with citeable
FACT. bet you can't.

http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20031016b.html
Here's a quote from this website:
"Michael Moore makes at least 17 factual errors or misrepresentations
in his latest book, Dude, Where's My Country?, ranging from stating
disputed information as fact to repeating a media myth to twisting his
own sources. As a companion to our article about Moore's mistakes in
Dude and his history of such distortions, here is a list of all the
errors that we found in the book:"

http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html

This one is probably the best one to look at the Lies of Bowling for
Columbine. It's a point by point refutation of Your hero. If you have
ANY intellectual honesty, you'll read it.

While I'm sure you're clutching your dolly. No, I don;t have to clutch
my gun under my pillow. But I DO have a plan of actiion for when the
SHTF. Do you? it's probably to hide under your covers and wet
yourself.

>Face it... 'an armed population' in the US has not reduced violent crime 

In every county of every state in the United states that has enacted
Shall-issue Concealed carry, the rate of violent crime has gone down
since the law was enacted. In every state that lacks Shall-issue,
violent crime has gone up. Please explain why Virginia, just across
the river from DC has an extremely low violent crime rate, yet has
Concelaed carry, while DC is the murder capitol of the US and has a
gunban.

Your logic is flawed.

If you REALLY want to look at an in-depth study of the facts from
someone who started the study as a gun contro advocate but was
convinced otherwise by FACTS, check this out.
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0226493636/t/103-3348824-6404620

It's pretty dry reading, but the guy's an economist & a statistician,
so it would be. But his facts have YET to be disproven by anyone.

Really?
http://www.tsra.com/Lott54.htm

England actually has surpassed the US in every category except Murder,
and theyr're catching up. And like i said earlier, if you take out
gang on gang crime, the murder rate in the US is lower than most of
Europe.
