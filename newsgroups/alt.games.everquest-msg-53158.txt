Cool thx.
I dont fail heals or many of my spells at all. I was slightly twinked in the
beginning but I have been concentrating on skills since I started. I
especially love going into Unrest and just using Ward Undead to kill
stuff...   If I skeleton walking around in WC, EC, WFp, etc I blow it away
hehe

Anyways, I just joined the Dragon Ring Guild and a few of us were working in
Unrest last night...  too many trains to stay very long... We were camping
the first section of the house.. killed a few things... 2 morons ran in and
down the hall... we told each other to be ready for train and sure enough
here comes an amtrak....

Going to Sol A today...

Thanks for the advice,
Kaelgrim
