    As a Shadow Knight, would you want to have to solo your way to the
Crusaders at any point when Darkforge would be a wearable armour for you?
(Ignore the Epic uses of DF for now.) SKs, in my admittedly limited
experience, solo best in the exact same places a Necromancer does: low-add
environments. Necro has Screaming Terror, SK can just Feign off stuff
without worrying about recasting a pet, but both are real pains in the butt.
I can't imagine a Shadow Knight starting in the courtyard and cutting his
way through all of Tae Temple to get to the Crusader up top. Not unless he
was pretty well kitted out, and if that's the case why camp DF?
