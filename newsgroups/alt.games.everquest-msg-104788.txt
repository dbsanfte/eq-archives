Orcs won't give Militia faction (guards in WFP and EFP) it will only help
with the NFP guards (Knights of Truth)
Fikus is not always present (think he wanders in the Militia halls) in my
experience but still aggro's my 52nd Warrior when I invis'd past a short
while ago.

Yes, if you kill the right mobs for faction you are welcome anywhere (My
Dark Elf can now walk around Kelethin safely, as long as I avoid the Bards)
and I have seen Iksar safely wlak thru both Nrth and West freeports.

There are not many decent methods for gaining Militia faction, Gnoll and Orc
scalps in High Pass and Goblin Ears in High Keep will, not really looked
into the faction much for the militia, waste of time as I enjoy killing
Slate too much.
