Heh, I'm not sure which mage pet you think can take that kind of 
punishment, my Vocerate earth only has 2600hps (give or take).
Now, when I hit 52, I've already got my big pet heal, I might 
be able to keep up long enough to go oom - maybe 3k more hp in
healing?  still - wouldn't take more than 30seconds if his dps
is really that high (against a max level 45 - barely blue to him -
pet, the numbers might be skewed high as well)
