I decided to make a new character last night, it's been a long long time
since I was a "noob"

Started off with a gnome wizard, jumped down the ramp in Akanon to die (damn
fall for 34! hehe) and spawned outside in SF, result.

Ported with my druid to WC, and ran to FP.  The only gear i had was that
nodrop 5/2000 dagger, or whatever it is, zero spells, zero other items, a
complete noob (more so, seens as I didn't hand in my letter to get my robe)

Result, 35mins killing = ding level 5.
I got bored at this point and logged.. but that kind of exp outside of a
dungeon seems incredible...

1-52 inside a week of pleveling?  (I don't see a wizard as being all that
easy to plevel)

I even had somebody try to beg from me, which was quite amusing as i was
probably the worst geared person in FP.. and the /shout will somebody kill a
guard for me please  repeated 50 times, and the /shout SOW/BIND PLZ!
scrolling and scrolling
