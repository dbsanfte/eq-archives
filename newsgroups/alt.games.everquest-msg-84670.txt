The Cazic Thule server was down for most of 1/31/02 and part of the day 
before.  I'm surprised no one here mentioned it, but I searched and 
haven't found anything.

A GM said in chat that Cazic had a RAID failure (hardware problems with 
disk drives) and that they spent the entire day working on it.  He said 
the first shift hardware guys were staying late.

The status went from DOWN to LOCKED when the server came back up but 
they weren't allowing people back in yet.  As of a few hours ago (2/1/02 
11am EDT) Cazic was back up.

Rumors were going around that Cazic would have to be restored from a 
backup to where things were 2 days earlier.  It appears this has not 
happened.

I checked briefly and my character doesn't appear to have lost anything. 
  There was no message of the day nor any information on the Sony web 
pages that I can see.
