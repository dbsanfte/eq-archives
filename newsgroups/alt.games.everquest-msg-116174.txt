The GPL has been described as viral in nature. In essence the source code 
is must be available to anyone who has received a copy of the program. Not 
everyone, just anyone to whom you have distributed the binaries. They are 
then free to do what ever they want with it, including giving it away to 
others for free. This is why you can download most anything GPL from the 
Internet. HOWEVER if you use any GPLed code in your program, you *must* 
license your program under the GPL. (You implicitly agree to this when you 
use the code in your program. It is part of the GPL license.) Therefore if 
Apple used GPLed code in OS X they would be required to release the source 
code to the affected portions of OS X. This is not something Apple would 
really want to do.

This is probably why they chose BSD over Linux. Both are good operating 
systems, but with BSD any modifications they make remain solely their 
property.

If I'm not mistaken the Windows TCP/IP protocol is also based on BSD.
