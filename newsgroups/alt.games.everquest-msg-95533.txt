When I first started EQ I had never played the game before...I had a hard
time making my character walk in the right direction and learning how to
communicate...there was a very kind 49 wizard who spent a few hours
patiently helping me along till I understood what the hell I was doing.
     Now that I am higher in level and able to gift new folks with goodies
and plat, I look for people who exibit those kind of newbie signs.  Anyone
who knows their way from Felwithe to Kelethin on their own at level one has
played this game before and most likely has an alt or two.
