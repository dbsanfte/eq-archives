Many have found this, looking for EQ but better, sorry, it's not that. It's
a game of it's own and although it may take many ideas in the it looks from
EQ the similarities seem to end there. The game is all geared towards RvR
play and until you have been involved in such you can't fairly judge the
game, it'd be like solo'ing a necro to 50 and never having grouped then
judging EQ.
I did not renew my subscribtion to Dark Age, I'm sure I will eventually but
I have not reached EQ burn out yet and have no room to play it, actually I
prolly would if it was still free but I was playing DAoC maybe twice a week
for a few hours rather than EQ 3 or 4 times a week and often entire
afternoons (and sometimes even the evenings) at weekends.

CF
I get my moneys worth from EQ, I wouldn't have done from Dark Age, yet.
