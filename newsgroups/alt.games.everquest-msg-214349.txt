SK would be the better choice.  Monks have no taunting abilities other than
beating the crap out of a mob.  Fear kiting a mob that has a Shaman DOT on
it is far better than just having a monk beat on it.  SKs FD is very
inferior to a Monks.  After playing a Monk it seemed like the SK FD took for
hours.  Only a few seconds to cast but still seemed awfully longer than a
monks.
