LOL,  OK I understand EQ "was" the forerunner of online gaming but it
really has no future. Lets put it this way, EQ is an old man in a
hospital bed, he's had his time and he has quite a few things wrong
with him that would take way to much time and money to fix , but we
can keep him stable for a while longer if we keep him hooked up to
life support. which is what they are doing. That's not a future , it's
not getting better. In some ways he's getting worst.
While in the Maternity Ward we have a few new arrivals waiting to
leave the hospital.

Thats what i mean by future, you can last 10 year more but if your not
advancing  you are only just bidding time till dead.
