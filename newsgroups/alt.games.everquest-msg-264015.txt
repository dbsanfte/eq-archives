No kidding.  Where's the sense of adventure?  Of wonder?  I mean, I can be 
sympathetic to the idea that you may want to grind out your levels in a few 
specific areas, but do people really lack the curiosity and interest in the 
game they're playing that they don't even want to *see* anything other than 
LDoNs or the other XP highway?  With all the zones there are in the game? 
Why are they playing?
