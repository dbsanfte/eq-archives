Actually while were on the subject of strange things agroing... My enchanter
got agrod last night by the freeport guards on the way to oot. Really wierd.
All I did was take the POK->FP stone, and run i through the gate, in high
elf form. Oh well. zoned out and back, and they are all apprehensive.
Wandered around, but nothing agrod me again. Wierd. I think they all con
green too, tho some green mobs will still attack.
