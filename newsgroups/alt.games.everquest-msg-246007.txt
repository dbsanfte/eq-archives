Even though the LDoN experience "only normal risk collection" quickly turns
into a routine grind, I still think it requires slightly more skill and
knowledge of your class than doing the same levels in the old grind style.
EC->Oasis->Loio->OT->DL.

What is this "real world", and where would be a better place than ldon to
prepare for it?


Also, now that I have a lot of leadership points, so people want to toss me
group leadership, I love to "shock" my group by not choosing
collect/slaughter missions.
Assassinations are my favorite.
