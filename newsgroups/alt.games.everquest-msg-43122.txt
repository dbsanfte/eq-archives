Heheh, no kidding.

At 47, I have 180 wis (plus a few decent +mana items).  To cap it at 200 wis
would yield me, roughly, another 10% in mana... nice, sure, but only an
additional half bubble of mana.  That is pretty much NEVER the difference
between life and death.  Except for 1 gift from a guildie, it's all equipment
I bought/quested for/looted by myself or my group, and I never camp items.
(If the mob I want isn't up, I will NEVER just sit there waiting for it.
Ever.  I have better things to do, thanks.)

I chose a Half Elf druid to be slightly different, and didn't put all my
points into wis (so I started with a base of 90).  Can't say I've had a hard
time of it, and I both group and solo.
