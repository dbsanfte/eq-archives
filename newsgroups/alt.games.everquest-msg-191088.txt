I got in on the final beta.

Downloaded it, patched it

Created a few different chars here and there.

Tried to get into it. Tried very hard to get into it and not give up.

Deleted it

Imagine you are in Qeynos and want to get exp, the nearest exp spot is the
aviak village in SK so you run there. Nothing in the way, same scenery over
and over.... and all the way at a run speed as if you are -1000 encumbered.


Slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwww /snore
