    Stop. The results are already out of whack because of the player being
there in the first place, if the player is exploiting. If the player is not
exploiting, there's *no reason to remove them*. The best course of action is
to leave them in, let the results be whatever they'll be, but not award
final prizes until the outcome of possible exploitation charges is known. If
there was NO DOUBT that the player was exploiting, I agree with removing
them. But when there's doubt, you don't DQ people based on hunches. As can
be seen in the player's rant, this was one of the things that steamed him:
the assumption of guilt on the part of the GM.

    Well, we both fault the diplomacy, at least. :-)
