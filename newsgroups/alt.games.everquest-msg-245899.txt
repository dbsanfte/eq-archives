Well.. i've heard references to 'dumbing down' concerning putting a
book out there. The thing most RPG companies are figuring out, and EQ
did with Planes of Power, is that a zone's popularity is inversely
propotional to the difficulty in getting there. Its like putting a 5
star hotel out in the middle of the Mojave off of a 5 mile dirt road
and just expecting tons of people to show up. It isn't going to
happen. The ZEM modifiers are a good way of giving people an incentive
to make the trek, a PoK book in Stonebrunt would do a lot to help it
along.

The only reason the books are there is to facilitate and enhance
transportation within Norrath. And I have no quibble with their
solution whatsoever. If some fanboy wants to masturbate to the fact
that he took 30 minute trips with 0 xp to get to his favorite zone
'back in the day', more power to him. But the transportation system
has done a lot to enhance zones people normally would not have taken
the trouble to go to. Call it 'dumbing down' if that makes your ego
happy, but it really did have to happen and should be a standard part
of pretty much every MMORPG.
