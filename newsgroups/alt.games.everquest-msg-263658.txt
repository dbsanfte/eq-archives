I can't speak for it's performance in EQ2 in particular, but, in general, 
the 6800 is significantly superior in performance to the 9800 Pro.  It's 
performance is around the same order of magnitude as the ATI X800.  
Depending on the application and settings, the numbers I have seen are 
anywhere from 30% to 100% performance improvement from the 9800 Pro to 
any of the 6800s.  The various 6800s are equivalent in performance to the 
various X800s, with the best X800 coming out somewhat on top of the best 
6800.
