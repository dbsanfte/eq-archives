those are the high DPS classes.

Bard with charmed pet
Enchanter with charmed pet

are also very high DPS, probably higher than most of the above... but 
these classes usually dont' run charmed pets in groups because they are 
busy and charmed pets can be hazardous

Druid can be a high DPS class, although lower than most of that list, if 
allowed to concentrate on producing damage... probably highest DPS on 
the whole list if they can run a charmed pet and still do their normal 
damage output (which happens more often when they get Dire Charm AA) but 
that requires animal mobs... and again, usually in groups you don't see 
druids running charmed pets.

Shaman can be decent dps if the mobs live long enough for DOTs, and 
again if allowed to concentrate on damage instead of slows and heals; 
they have a pretty good pet which means they are at least medium DPS at 
all times... but without adding in DOTs or at least nukes, they may do 
less damage than paladins.

Paladins are distinctly second teir: they compare with warriors, and 
shadowknights.

Third tier would be enchanters, shaman, druids, bards,  who aren't 
working the DPS tricks I mention above...and clerics.  But even clerics 
may be able to out DPS paladins in the narrow 56-60 range in certain 
circumstances, if allowed free rein to do damage instead of holding back 
much of their potential in order to play healers; pet plus melee with 
lots of unresistable procs plus MOR plus nukes that aren't inefficient, 
just slow to cast and recast.

One of the problems paladins have in doing damage is that they are 
normally MT in a group, this costs them roughly 15% of their damage 
output because of the mob dodge, parry, block, and riposte, not to 
mention mob stunning the MT (no ogre paladins).  That second paladin 
will at least not suffer this problem, but 15% more DPS still isn't 
going to make him competitive with the real DPS classes.

Paladins can also pull up into the high DPS range if their targets are 
undead (of course clerics also can be decent DPS here... but paladins 
improve more than clerics).  SO if this group went to the undead heavy 
LDoN missions it would be better off, just as a group with lots of pets 
and access to mage weapons is better off on the missions with lots of 
summoned mobs.

If you want an example of the difference in High DPS and medium DPS, my 
mage went LD the other day in an LDoN group, and when I logged back on I 
was getting some ribbing from my group, so I made a pet, caught back up 
to them, and didn't hit follow.  They were already working on a kill, 
had it to 80%.  I sicced my pet, nuked twice (and I was nuking either 
once or twice every mob in that group), and got the exp for the kill.  I 
outdamaged the group of 4 doing less than I normally do (normally the 
pet would engage by 95%).  Shadowknight, Rogue, plus an enchanter and 
cleric who weren't doing any DPS work at all.  Show me a paladin who can 
walk up to a similar group and pull off the same stunt.
