    Was there...
    Saw that...
    Put the brakes on it...

    While I was train proof in BB at the time, but the five or six guys that
stood and fought (bravest or stupidest people I have EVER seen... you decide
which) weren't.
    I don't know which was more fun... seeing the train... or fighting it.

I'm reminded of a cadance song:

Out jumpped a Wizard from the edge of the zone...
He was a bad mamba jamba, you could tell by his robe.
It was No Drop Lore with some stuff from the planes...
He was screaming, "Train, O'Train... Yeah! Bring it my way!"
Lined all the gnolls up against the wall...
Made a 2 copper bet, he could kill them all...
Nuked 98 till there was no more blue...
Then he unpacked his stick and he beat the other two
.

.
hundred.
