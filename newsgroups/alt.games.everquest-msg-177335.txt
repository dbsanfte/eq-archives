    It wasnt ALL like that..... i was doing that 90% of the time with a
group of my RL friends, and the chat and silliness between pops made it
worth it at times, and I remember one time the place had an almost party
atmosphere for some reason, people running from one group  to another
buffing each other for no better reason than to spread the vibe... why
couldnt it always be like that?

    As to somewhere else... it was my first toon and despite everythign else
that was the fastest experience I found anywhere... didnt have any
expansions and on other peoples advice that was the only place to be. Might
not be totally true but was definitely Good Advice since it got us all to
lvl 30 in our first month of playing and away from the lonely, empty zones.

    Mind you the most fun ive ever had in the game was when we were lvl 12
or so (dunno how accurate that is) and our tiny little group went into
Befallen alone..... we wiped twice down there and had to be resuced by lvl
60 demigods (they were gods to us i can tell you, awesome to see them in
action) but it was incredibly entertaining. We almost never saw anyone else
in there tho, and never another group.

    I still think they should adjust the spawn rate of gobbies somehow to
the population of the zone. I know that would cause new problems but they'd
be more interesting ones than bored people pissing each other off for
something to do.
