Nice. And you didn't even bother to tell him to unplug his speakers
before he does that.  The music in that town will quickly drive ANYONE
over the fucking edge and send them looking for a chainsaw and a pack of
girlscouts to turn it on, while the neighbor's dog barks encouraging
commands from over the fence.  Sheesh. I played there for about five
minutes and fully understood where the asslings get their terrible
reputation. And it's nothing to do with being a druid, either. They were
just forced to listen to the gawdsawful music for ten or fifteen levels
and just snapped.
