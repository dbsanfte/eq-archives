Assuming there's a group or two there (is there ever NOT a group?), simply
ask them if they mind if you take a swing at each critter.

That's all you have to do...you can even remove your weapon and try to PUNCH
it.  I'd leave the pet at home...it's hard to trust the word of a DE necro
with a pet, and your pet doesn't need faction work. :)
