their long cast times don't cost any med time, and comperable mana 
regen, and clerics can do quite well on the damage per hour scale by 
nuking at several different level breaks (shortly after getting their 
next nuke, while other classes don't have their next higher efficiency 
nuke yet)

Splendid
