If you're talking about the regular gators waddling around there (swamp
gators, I believe?) they are factionless and non social. You can gank
all you want without getting swarmed or taking faction hits.
  The fungusmen are both social and have faction, which you will trash
and become KOS after you whack a few. I *believe* they are on the
froggies' faction, but can't swear to it without my references.
