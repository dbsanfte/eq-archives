Looong ago, when the servers were relatively young and my main 
character had clawed his way up to level 5 after several days 
of work (this was back when dying at level 5 would lose you exp, and 
since I started out with no friends or guild in the game, I was 
entirely on my own), and had acquired what was for me at the time 
some reasonably decent gear, I was fighting around Kelethin when 
someone ooc'ed, "porting from the wizard spire to NK".

I had recently read that Misty Thicket was a good zone
for someone of my level, and after getting beat up in GFay
and BB I decided to go "see the world".  I noted on my
maps that NK was a lot closer to Misty Thicket than GFay,
so I hiked to the wizard spires and hitched a ride.  As
it turned out he expected a hefty (to me in those days)
fee, but when I said that I didn't have the enormous
sum of 10p, he offered to take me for free, which I
appreciated.

The Wizard ported his passengers to NK, then gated out.

I poked around the "guardhouse" there, then did an /ooc
saying, "Level 5 Paladin newly arrived to this zone,
what should I do while I'm here?"

I swear, I got five replies all saying, "RUN!"

After /conning a few distant mobs and finding them
all blood red to me, I realized the error of my ways,
and the unlikelihood of hiking safely across the plains
of Karana.

While pondering my next move, I explored the guardhouse
some more, and climbed up the stairs to the top of the
guardhouse to admire the view.

Where I promptly fell to my death.

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  You have entered Greater Faydark.
Naked.

Panic.

Now I had to figure out how to bum a free port back to my
corpse to retrieve my gear, and then back again to a zone
safe for a level 5 Paladin.

I sent out a call for a port, explaining my predicament
and asking for some kind soul to do me a freebie favor.

Eventually someone in wolf form showed up (at the time,
still a novelty) and asked me where my corpse was.  I told
him, and he said that if I /consented him, he could go there,
loot my corpse, and bring my stuff back to me (this was in
the days when that was still possible).  I wondered why
he couldn't just take me there and back, but I figured
beggars couldn't be choosers, so I /consented him.  He
vanished, and I sat for a few minutes wondering if maybe
he was running off with my stuff, but eventually he
returned and handed me everything I had owned.
(Looking back, he may have been low enough level that
he had the self-port NK spell but not the group-port yet.)

I thanked him, and asked him how I could possibly
repay his kindness.  He responded, "a lot of people
have a bad opinion of Druids.  The next time someone
tells you that, just remember that there are some
good ones out there."

I've never forgotten.
