    Not many people seem to understand how much members in a group rely on
one another. There seems to be an underlying "I'll suffer your presence, but
I could do just as well without you". I find people in the crowd control and
healing classes tend to get it, but inexperienced tanks and solo classes do
not.

    In a game with near-mandatory grouping, the friend that knows their role
and plays as much as you do is gold.

    A lot of people are competitive, and the low mental age of some EQ
players doesn't help matters.

    This is a VERY limiting action. People will remember that you abandoned
them, and will not group with you again. They WILL tell any
friends/guildmates about what you did, and you can be sure your side of the
story will not enter into what's said. Now, there's a ton of people out
there, so grouping won't be impossible - just harder. And in a game where
waiting for a group is the worst part, minimizing the wait is a good thing.

    Also, try to think about the entire group. Did EVERYONE abuse you, or
just the one person? When you gated, who got hurt - that one person, or the
entire group? I was in a Sol B Pool group with an alt, and our moron monk
puller went and killed the last mob a 60 cleric's alt needed to ding. Total
KS job. The 60 cleric logged on his main, came up to our camp, and declared
that he was sick of garbage like this, that this guy wasn't getting any XP
and we'd boot him if we knew what's good for us. At this point I identified
my main, and asked the cleric if he really wanted to upset four people, who
had who knows who as mains and who had done nothing wrong to him, over one
moron and one mob. He got the point.

    It never changes. It's like native treaty claims in British Columbia -
if you add up all the land the different bands are claiming, it accounts for
over 100% of the total land area of the province. If you add up what each
person thinks is "their fair share", it always comes out to be more than
what there is.

    I understand. It STINKS when you have a bad experience with someone, or
several someones. I have a friend who is less patient than me, who runs into
at least one person a day like this. I try to take the long view, as I
really enjoy the underlying game and want to keep playing it as long as
possible.

    Anyone that argues about loot looks like a money-grubber, at first.
Unless you argue for something that's really fair to everyone - then people
will like you.

    Fairest system I know for cash items requires you to have one person
that's trustworthy - master looting. One person loots all mob, and only that
person. They can pay you one plat per Symbol cast, then /split the rest of
the cash. As gems and what not drop, if they aren't valuable enough to be
rolled on they go to the players in a very specific order (like alpha, or
the order you appear in the master looter's group list). If you get
something less valuable than someone else - well, luck of the draw.

    Brell Serilis is the god of the underground, and my cleric's god in
particular.

    The first buff you can stop casting in cases like this is your AC buff.
HPs save lives - the effect of an extra 15 to 25 AC over the length of the
buff is debatable. Normally, I'd assume that the spell was playtested to be
worth the mana cost over the course of the buff's duration - but given the
playtesters involved, I wouldn't be so sure. Look at the shaman buffs. :-(
