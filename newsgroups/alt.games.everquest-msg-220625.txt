    Information like that (which isn't gathered using ShowEQ) comes from
people with tracking, though. Without tracking, you never learn things like
that.

    The easiest example I have of how invaluable tracking is would be
checking mobs. Let's say my guild wants to see if Xegony is up. We can't
just rely on previous kill time, as the Australian guild is capable of
taking her out. We can zone in a rogue, have them wander all the way through
the zone to the top (dodging the various see-SoS wanderers along the way),
and assuming they're keyed, have them visually check the spawn. Or, we can
zone in a ranger and have them hit that "Tracking" button. Which wastes the
least time of the 60-odd people waiting to do something?
