Probably not... but warm up by fighting Servitor, and if you have trouble,
don't move on to Grieg.

Vaniki is a named level 63 chetari, drops Willsapper.  (13/20 1h piercer 9
ac 35 hp, procs a ~35% slow)
Flurrys, gates, doesn't rampage.

MA of the pharm club on Tarew Marr is paying over 90k for loot rights on
one, heh, bastard has a screenshot of himself with over 1,700,000 pp.

That's rather bad.  Go nerf some dorf faction in Icewell and get him a Royal
Velium BP, or go to Hate for Indicolite, or PoG for Berserkers.
Particularly Icewell, just clear in to the Royal guards, kill them, if no
BP, leave and go fix faction and try to get some Kael armor.  Hate, just
port up, fight to safe spot, pull all the Kiraikuei, whatever other people
want to kill, and leave.

And for the love of god merit the first BP in whatever of those places you
go to to your MA.
