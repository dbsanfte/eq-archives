Yep.  OTOH I've yet to see or hear of a Paladin equipable 1H
Piercer that would be interesting to a char over L20 or so.
Not saying they don't exist, but nary a one has come to my
attention.  Keep in mind that Paladin and Shadowknight don't
get dual wield, so the standard for an "interesting" 1H
weapon is higher for them than for WAR/MNK/RNG.
