I have put in a Feature Request several times- "Even if there is no 
animation, make 'D' break a cast while mounted". My current modus is to 
type /dism, then d d. 

The /dism will usually 'soft interrupt' a spell, meaning the spell takes 
full cast time and then says it's been interrupted. The two d's break the 
spell instantly, which is handy since I play a cleric and if I have to 
break a spell it's usually because I don't have time to wait for it to land 
and I need to spam out some fast heals.
