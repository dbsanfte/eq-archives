No you are a caster with the ability to kite him, you don't have to stand
there and there toe2to2 with him hitting for quad 100's
Slate is actually no tougher than any newbie guard out there at the same
level. Nash and Leopold, in Qeynos Hills (who are only 35th, I believe) both
hit for the same damage as Slate (a lot less health on them, tho) The Inn
guards in N Ro are a Harder task than Slate as they seem to have far more
Magic Resist.
You are right Slate is nothing special for a 42nd level uber buffed guard
but saying that it takes a Warrior some 10 levels (and more) Higher than
Slate to Solo him, not sure about a Hybrid, I think a 47th or so SK might be
able to take him solo...

CF
Wonder how many 42nd level Warriors (No healing) working as a team, it would
take to kill Slate.
