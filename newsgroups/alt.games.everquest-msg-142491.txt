The dot in now valid with the dot damage changes and this is what I
think most people call kiting.

> SNARE + DD/DOT + ROOT = Root Kiting

You are the only person I know who would call this kiting. This is
root/dotting or rotting. But generally you dont stick a DD in there as
it breaks root. The only time I use a DD when rotting is if the dots
have worn off and the Mob has a sliver of health left.

If you are AE kiting why would you dot or use single target DD until the
kite is over (i.e. most mobs are dead or are running in place, but
spread out) In any case single taarget DD and DOTs are not an integral
part of AE, the mobs could be finished in any manner.


I notice that the mention of rain spells has gone <G>

This generally describes kiting.
Note that it is called kiting because it is like you are running around
pulling a kite (Mob) on a string.

This is rotting not kiting.
If this is kiting then your kite has crashed and you are Charlie Brown.

Shame that from my experience no one elese thinks this.

I really dont think that we could.
By your definition a mage with a pet is kiting, because the mage does
not get hit.

While a necro using darkness + Fear + Pet is fear kiting (I have seen
this called reverse kiting since the mob is pulling the pet)

I hope that I have explained as well as you explained wht you thought.

It just that the difference between kiting and rotting seems to be seen
fairly universally, and what you were saying went against that.

HTH,
