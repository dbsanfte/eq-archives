The final part isn't that hard, you can do it with 2 groups. The most hard
part of the epic is the overking in Chardock, for that you need at least 3
groups of 55+ players( Some told me they did it with one group but I thinnk
you need very well equiped level 65 players for that), but if you are lucky
this part is also possible to MQ. I used this link for my epic
http://www.planeteq.com/clerics/cleric_epic.htm

What you can do when you have a couple of players online is hunting the 4
shards in Skyfire so that you have them when you are ready for the final
part. Its very fustrating when you did all but dont have the 4 shards yet
( Like I did ). The dropping rate is about 1% of all mobs there so you need
to kill appx 400 mobs in Skyfire to obtain the shards )
