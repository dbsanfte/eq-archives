In my experience warriors are very poor at maintaining agro compared to
other tank (any really) classes, almost any other class can take agro
from them *if they want*.  Paladins are the best of the heavy tanks at
gaining & maintaining agro, unfortunately only weaker races can be
paladins so they aren't anywhere near as good at taking the beating,
have lower hp and not as much damage mittigating skills.  Warriors are
also probably the last class for dealing damage on the pile, with
clerics possibly being the contender.  What warriors do better than any
other class is mitigate and absorb damage.  They will have more HP than
any other class and will take less damage than any other due to armor
and skills.

If you want to be able to take a beating better than any other class
then warrior is for you.  That's thier area of expertise.  If you want
to be the best at this ogre is unfortunately the only race for this due
to stun immunity & highest stamina, with troll being a distant second
with regen and 2nd highest stamina, and all others being much farther
behind.
