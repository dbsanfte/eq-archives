}when there are 4 mobs, all on top of each other, all called "a cutthroat
}dervish" all the same race, all conning yellow, with each animation
}interfering with each other, pray tell how you detect which one is not
}attacking you? Since I had about 350 hit points at the time, and had 3 or 4
}mobs attacking for 30-40 damage a time, I can't stop fighting for a couple
}of rounds of hits, to see which one is not attacking me.

As soon as you see the mez message, back up three paces and hit F8.

Your enchanter will love you dearly for it.
