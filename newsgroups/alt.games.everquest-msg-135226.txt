Yes, my mistake, mine should have read as the
Magician being 12.

This is the GD system of attribution, there are
many more.

Mercury (Hermes, also Lucifer the Light Bringer)
as the morning star has no light of its own. Its
light is reflected (or brought from) the Sun
(Apollo).

The colour associated with the Sun is yellow

Book T is online here, along with many other GD

Ok, we'll mark that one down as a definite.
