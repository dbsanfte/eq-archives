    well, if I read what they were going to do , the C-heal that druids
would get will not do a complete heal, only about 75%.  I imagine a name
change to teh spell will be in place.

I think the changes to the cleric class will make them even more desirable
in a group.  If i read right, you would need LESS clerics than you normally
would.  IN that case, the druid makes an excellent back, and provide the
Succor escape if the group gets in trouble.  Besides teh port, thats what
the druid brings to the table.  soem buffs, some DS, but Port in and a
succor out if needed, along with a back up heal, nuke, snare, root, etc.

Be interesting to see how the cleric, along with the rest of the priest
class, pan out before they bring out Planes of Power.
