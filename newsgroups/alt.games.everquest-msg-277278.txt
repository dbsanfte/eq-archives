:-)  One of my abilities did that for me too when I was betraying.  I
think that your brawling went down when you went past 100% because it
goes up steadily as you gain experience and should be 90 at level 18.
It will come back to you as soon as you finish your betrayal quest.  I
reported it but it looks like they haven't fixed it.
