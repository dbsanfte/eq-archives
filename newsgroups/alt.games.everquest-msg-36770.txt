By my count that is a minimum of 10,000 mouse clicks. Oh my karate pinky.

On the same note I had a friend that knows I am a tailor
say he would pay me to make a set of Wu's armor for him
and I said only if you bring me all the ingredients.

Him "But can't you just do it?"
Me "Nope"
Him "why not?"
Me "Because I am sick of hunting spiders and I don't
want to mouse click 500+ times to make the Heady kiolas, or
spend umpteen minutes enchanting the mana to make
your character armor"
Him "Ok I'll pay you"
Me "You don't have enough, trust me"
Him "sheesh is it really that tough?"
Me "I'll do it. All you have to do is bring me about
25 silk swatches, 50 or so heady Kiolas and about 15
mana vials(some extra to account for failure)."
Him "ok np"

2 weeks later

Him "Hey I finally got all that stuff for the monk armor"
Him "OMG you weren't kidding this stuff is a pain in the
ass"

Me "=)"
