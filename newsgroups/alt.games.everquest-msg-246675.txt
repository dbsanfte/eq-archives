Friday I log on and find the guild MOTD talking of a proposal. Guild chat
soon informs me what it is: Acropolis, one of the older, more respected
guilds on Tholuxe Paells, has proposed a merger.

  This sounds interesting. Acropolis is currently doing PoP backflagging and
raids in VT, so Adas would leap forward in her development. But wait: it
turns out not te be a merger of equals, where both guilds are disbanded and
reform together under a new name, with the usual GM approval lag. Nor is it
an acquisition, with KR disbanding and all members who wish going to
Acropolis with relaxed entry restrictions (normally, Acropolis accepts only
level 65 with many AA's; for us, they will take level 60, no AA's). No, this
is simply an invitation
extended to the higher level KR members who are tired of not being able to
get enough attendance for raids.

  The raiders have become the raided.

  I find myself in a difficult position. At the age of 36, this is the first
time perhaps in my whole life when I have a cadre of truly good friends, and
they are splitting up. I must choose between them. I do not feel espescially
worried or despairing: this is such a novel situation I don't feel much of
anything. But...

  In the end, there is no choice for me. Acropolis requires 4 nights a week
of raiding during their hours...when I am at work. I can't change shifts so
easily, and won't give up RL friends just to advance Adas. She's in PoV
outer much of the time now, and just dinged 61; she will be in BoT soon, and
should have no problem levelling at the normal pace. She will stay with KR.

  That is, if KR remains a going concern. The officers who left had plans of
making it a mandatory-raid guild, a hard-charging, Quarm-or-bust guild, but
now they are gone. There has been some speculation that KR will have a new
purpose: to be oa stepping stone, a starter guild to help lower level
characters level up and get keys, flags, and other preparedness for the
uber-guilds like Acropolis. There is still a desire to do some raiding, but
we may need a partner. I would hope at least we will be better able to get
guild groups together.

  So...off to kite in PoV again.
