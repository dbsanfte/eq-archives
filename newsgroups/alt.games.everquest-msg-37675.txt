Any time you throw a brick wall, especially one that makes no game
world sense, in front of an innate ability to do something that a
character has in a game like this it makes no sense. Things have stuff
to drop, the thing does not care who is killing it. Do you think that
the panda or whatever sees my more uber druid and turns its back to me
while sweating and rapidly destroys any loot it has? That hardly makes
sense. What you have here is a band-aid solution to the real problem
of too much staticness. You also have something else, you have the
solution being applied to zones where it will make absolutly no
difference in 2 months or so when stonebrunt is empty as warrens was
empty before stonebrunt was added. People get in these areas RIGHT
after they go up and go "ooooh 56 people ooh trvial combat code good..
ooohhh!!" they don't come back though in 3 months when my druid is the
only person in the zone and thinks its pretty darn stupid that I can't
mess around and kill a couple things and do some drop item quests for 
faction or whatever.

Yeah. One other thing is that these zones are in no way "power loot
camping/farming" zones. Stonebrunt has some boots that are like 0.1
weight and 8 str, 6 ac and monk and beastlord as basically the only
thing worth even getting there. That item might seem to kind of be
okay for a monk now before it has better, but I don't see one item as
ruining the entire zone for lower levels. Also I believe that item
comes off something which is blue to a pretty high level. I heard one
thing there is blue up to level 59.

Ahaha yes, my 37 cleric went there and could not do a damn thing. My
32 sk could probably do a lot more alone and ironically would have a 
better chance at getting a group. When my cleric was there it was
"tank wanted" for groups late 20's early 30's which was being called
out. I saw some groups and it was funny because they were mostly
druids. Think about why they would mostly be druids or druid heavy for
a moment or perhaps wizard ... yep, exactly, toxula port. Tanks are
going to have the hardest time there since they can only be bound in
paineel I believe.

And if I really wanted it my druid would just have some low levels
help me kill them so I'd get the drop. I'd then have no trouble with
the ToFS part either. Also that is not cheating. Cheating is when you
have a card up your sleeve or crib notes during a test. Cheating is
not when you just do what the game engine allows in response to a
stupid rule.

He must be dead a lot cause my druid never saw anything with that name
or that was blue to her (55) I will keep my eyes open though since it
is blue. I heard one thing there was blue to a 59 even.. maybe that
was him? What else would be blue to a 59? My other lower char did hear
someone mention the boots once, as though they had looted them.

No, actually they don't care. As I said above this is more or less of
a code test and a "we care so much and are so forward thinking" bunch
of pr propaganda. The thing is, this actually fools many players. Many
lower players actually thinks this makes a difference, I heard them
saying so in the zone. Yeah, watch out, if that code was not in my
druid would have been KSing them like mad for some 28 spd 6 dam magic
POS. Verant, however, does not care that it makes no difference. They
only care that some people THINK it does and that they can claim it as
a "verant cares" piece of propaganda. 

See, if verant gives a CNET interview and they talk about stuff like
that the CNET reporter will go "Verant is so forward thinking as to 
put in a trivial combat code to solve higher level farming problems..
blah blah blah" The CNET or whatver person is never going to bother to
investigate this claim themselves or even with a flunky who possibly
even plays Everquest though. The CNET person is never going to
investigate such a claim at all, but instead as often is done in the
mainstream media when reporting about video games is just going to
report what the maker said. You won't ever hear such a reporter say, 

"But in actuallity this loot code is nothing more than a pat on the
back for themselves from Verant and accomplishes JACK CRAP in a zone
that will be empty in 2 months anway due to its remoteness and being
over in the toxula vortex of SUCK unless you happen to be in a high
level guild doing a hole raid for some specific items. "

Ahaha kitties, ball of yarn, ahaha.

Exactly. Once some people find the items there other people decide
whether or not to bother with getting around the stupid useless code.

AAHHA what I was talking about above only I think I said 8 damage.
Yeah, exactly. See many of those quests I would not bother to do
anyway, or might do for faction when no one else is ever there just
for the heck of it.

I saw another error there in text quest giving. One kitty talks about
stuff and if you ask it the further bracketed items, it speels out the
same stuff as originally you saw those bracketed items in. So in other
words its kind of a loop with no end. Evidently its not quite finished
(ooooh surprise...)
