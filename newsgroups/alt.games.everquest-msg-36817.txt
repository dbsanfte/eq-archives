Biggest train i ever seen was on Kerra Isle, before i found out WHY the Kerrans
didnt like me. Tried to enter in wolf form, and they get a little pissed over
that.
So i invissed up, and went to see M-something (the NPC for the Paw of Opolla
quest), shes around halfway into the zone. Then mi invis broke, and all Kerrans
join into a train, even the greenies, and since they have a lot of guards posted
everywhere i got at least 20 on my ass, didnt feel like turning around and
checking, was more interested in coming out alive.
