Sorry to argue, but YOU are wrong.

Glide was always the preferred 3D standard when the 3d accelerator wars
started.  It's smaller, and faster - although the textures are a little blurry.
 Also, because it is designed for a particular piece of hardware, the
compatibility is FAR better than direct3d.

Glide got bumped in Luclin because of the move to DirectX 8.1.  There is no
reason why glide still coudln't be used, but because 3DFX is out of business,
there is little desire to take the time to port the game to glide.
