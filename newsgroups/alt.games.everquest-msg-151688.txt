oddly, serverwide means "accross all servers" for some reason, thus
the channel
serverwide.age:(password you have to figure out yourself)
works for alt.games.everquest participants from all the servers out there.
A channel
serverwide.auction
would be pretty useless, except I suppose for those people who keep
auctioning "will trade 100Kpp in goods on Drinal for 50Kpp on
Morell Thule"

For Morell Thule, its auctions, and has a password

/join auctions:auctions

will work, while
/join auction
will get you in a channel all alone or with the couple other
people who joined the wrong thing (auctions probably
has upwards of 50 people any time night or day)
