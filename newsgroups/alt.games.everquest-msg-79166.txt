You don't understand dual-wield (even if you can spell it better than I 
can) and you don't understand probability.  Please stop spreading 
incorrect information.

Bullshit.  You don't understand probability, and you don't seem 
interesting in learning, so this is probably wasted breath.  Do you agree 
that if you have a 50% chance of it working, then it will fire 1/2 the 
time on average?  So take two weapons, 5/10 and 20/40.  Every 1 second the 
first weapon has a 50% chance of swinging and every 4 seconds the second 
weapon has a 50% chance of swinging.  It averages out to once every 2 
seconds for the first weapon and once every 8 seconds for the second 
weapon.  The first weapon swings 4 times as often.
However, each hit with the second weapon averages 4 times as much damage 
as a hit with the first weapon.  So you either hit ever 2 seconds for x 
damage or every 8 seconds for 4x damage.  It's the exact same amount of 
damage.

Failures are a PERCENTAGE.  If I flip a coin 100 times it should come up 
heads 50% of the time.  If I flip a coin 1000 times it should come up 
heads 50% of the time.  If I flip a coin 1,000,000 times it should come up 
heads 50% of the time.  It doesn't matter.

You are wrong.  Unless you are trying to get dual-wield skill increases, 
delay has NO EFFECT ON OFF HAND DAMAGE.  (OK, unless you are killing the 
mobs so fast that you don't have time for dual-weild to fire.)
