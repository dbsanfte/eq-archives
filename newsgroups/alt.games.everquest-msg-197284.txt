Well, speaking as someone who's played Enchanters only at low levels
(never higher than 17), I found that Fear sucked for exactly that
reason.  And a Stun or a Mez makes a much better aid to running away.
I tried to find a use for Fear and finally gave it up as a total
waste of mana for a lowbie Enchanter.

Especially at low level, bandaging to 50% when you start out with
total crap for HP doesn't do a whole lot.

If he isn't running around with KEI, Fear still sucks.  It's a very
short duration mana hog at low levels.  There are lots better things
to do with a lowbie Enchanter's mana than casting Fear, IMO.
