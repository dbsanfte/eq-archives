Bonk the dumb cleric fast. have the group leader tell them to do their 
job and if they still dont, bail on the adventure or ungroup the cleric 
and hope you can finish if you are near enough the end....but after 3 
deaths, i would just get the tank  rezzes and take the failure. As a 
responsible cleric, i have no trouble if it is a bad pull or there is a 
serious problem in asking my druid or shammy to lend a quick hand with a 
heal or two.

Anything that gets the job done works for me. I have no problem in 
letting people know where things stand. If i need someone to do a couple 
heals for me, or to hold a pull for just a second, i ask. if someone 
needs something from me, i have no problem in helping out.
