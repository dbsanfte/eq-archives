So basically, if you wipe 3 hours into a raid, you think that to get XP
back, you should have to be able to redo the raid to that point again in 3
hours, except this time you do it naked?

Corpse recovery has always seemed cruel to me in EQ.  You've died.  That
means there is something there that you were unable to handle.  So...make
you go back there again naked?
