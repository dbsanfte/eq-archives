I have seen a total of ONE Yew leaf as ground spawn. Were inside druid 
ring and happened to look at the ground when i were waiting for people.
As for getting them, it will wiht 99% certanity be easier to get a 
forager there and forage them for you, should get 1 a hour or so wiht 
200 skill, should be a LOT more than if you try to run around invis in a 
45+ zone with frame lag (at least on my comp, stupid trees) looking at 
the ground.
