I've played in Forgotten Halls for various level characters, usually
the rat room.  The bats and rats have never social aggroed, at level
21 or at level 55 or at level 65 or at level 70.  However, I think
there is a room that is mixed bats and rats and they may social aggro
(I've never bothered to try as I cannot keep the rat room clear).
Anyway, it's strange ppl are getting different experiences regarding
aggro there.  


Another strange thing about Forgotten Hall is that if you have more
than one person in a group, it's unpredicatable what level the mobs
will be.  With 2 ppl, the average level seems to be taken and the
dungeon spawns based on that number.  With 3 ppl (one level 58 and two
level 65), the mobs were all light-blue or green to the level 65s.
