Personally, I like grouping with: wizard, shaman, enchie, necro, and a 
tank (preference: monks).  Wizard for the nukes, shaman for the buffs, 
enchies for the slows and breeze/clarities, necro for the heals and 
fears, and monk for mend, and because I like monks.  Specifically, lizzy 
monks. :)  A'course I'm probably missing some of what each class does 
since I haven't played em myself, or at most have played them only to a 
very low level.  But still.  That's how I like it.
