I would put it:
AC (a dead rogue does no damage)
Weapons (rogues are, after all, all about damage)
HPs (see #1)
Resists (moves up once you start raiding)

This is independant of twinking.  This was, and is, my priorities as a
primary rogue.

Actually, I would say that *ratio* is far more important than raw speed.
Once a damage bonus kicks in, most rogues will prefer a 8/16 weapon to a
16/32 weapon in their mainhand.  Offhand is *strictly* about ratio since it
never gets a damage bonus.
Primary needs to always be piercing for backstabs, but there's nothing wrong
with having a decent 1HS or 1HB offhand.

I'm not sure how BA compares to the old BI but BI was *heavy*.  You might
look into RyGorr since its been dropping in price a lot lately.  BP can be
gotten for 500-750ish.

I'm generally fairly anti-twink but not against starting things out with a
bit of banded or what not.  Since you can't swing a dead cat without hitting
a twink rogue lately, and rogue being my *only* class for the last year,
it's a subject I'm 'involved' with.  As you twink your rogue, do take the
time to read a well written post I copied from a friend at the Safehouse.  I
felt he summed it up well how many of us feel:
