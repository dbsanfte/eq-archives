The PvP in DAoC is different. It's team-based, but unlike EQ
team-based PvP, the team's homelands are geographically seperate and
independant. If you never leave your homeland, you may never see PvP.
The PvP occurs in disputed border areas.

There are two ladders in DAoC: the usual xp for PvE and a title system
earned through PvP.

PvE in the PvP zones is unclear at this time although there is demand
for it. PvP in the PvE zones is possible; however, Mythic claims it
will be very difficult to enter another realms PvE areas. Whether that
holds true or not, you cannot bind in enemy territory so grief players
shouldn't be a big problem.

Most likely.
