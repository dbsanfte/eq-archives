Nice job!

Its always much much easier after that first kill...  I remember when AoW
used to kick our butts, when we finally killed him, we went like 10 straight
wins in a row (something like 17-1 wins/losses since then)

You should go try Vindi again now, if your raid has a 60 shaman+OOS bard
(what level is occlusion?) you should pull statue too.

If you get statue slowed, hes a much much easier fight than Vindi

Velk is even easier than Vindi, and his robe/spellbook would probably be a
huge upgrade for you (his robe is a right click nuke, you will NEVER destroy
that robe)

Or you could just pharm trak and get yourself a manna robe!
