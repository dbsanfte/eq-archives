Actually you can tell your pet to sit down, and then tell it to guard
here, it will be in the guard mode, while sitting and getting more hp
back.  I use guard here often as i usually pull to my pet when not
hunting static spawn.  Such as when i was in Steamfont and pulling
skeletons from about 4 different spots, as well as the doorway mino
slaver.  The other useful thing about guard here is it will track the
closest mob.  I found that especially useful on sister island, where
they were off in the distance somewhat and harder to see.
