Its safe enough, but probably faster (for a druid) to run down ot the
firepot room in the sw corner of TD and take the cabilis pot (west one on
south from memory, but u better check that if u want to use it). Make sure
you have camo up before you use it, youll be KOS in cabilis. Its right next
to the zoneline and quite safe so long as your camo doesnt come down in the
first 20 sec.
