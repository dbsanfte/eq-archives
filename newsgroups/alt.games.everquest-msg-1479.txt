: For us non-rogues, that's good to know.  :)

Just for further clarification (this is getting messy, hehe):  By non-rogue,
I don't mean people who aren't rogues.  I mean people who have a rogue
because they awant to be l337 damagers and "get wit' da 'm4d sklz',yo." not
because they like the idea of *being* a rogue. (this may have been clear
before, jsut wanted to make sure ^_^)

The rogue community is really different from any other class in EQ, IMO.  To
my knowlege, no other group of players identifies with their class like the
hardcore rogues do (or at least in such numbers).  Cyriex made a good post
on the Safehouse about "Having a rogue versus *being* a rogue."  It's a HUGE
difference for most of us.

Okay, enough of my roguish prattling, I've attracted enough attention to
myself.
