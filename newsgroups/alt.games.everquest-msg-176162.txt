Jazz, my L26 Warrior on Test has an AC in the 600s.  Low 20s mobs
(dark blue to him) do less than 4 DPS to him.  It takes my Shaman
roughly 5 seconds per cast to chain Inner Fire (20hp buff/heal),
and it actually gets cast less often than that because I swap
between the characters so I can Kick/Slam.  The weaker mobs I pull
(the low twenties stuff) cannot damage him as fast as the Shaman
heals him.  Less than 4 DPS is hardly "WAY" more than the 2.5 HPS
regen of a Fungi.  The tougher mobs do more damage of course, but
that's because his AC isn't high enough to reach the softcap for
their better ATK bonus.  If this twink's other armor is anywhere
near the relative cost of the Fungi (keeping in mind that BPs cost
a lot more than most other slots) he's above the softcap for any
mob he can hit reliably at his level.

Not unless his other gear is a whole lot poorer than the Fungi would
imply.  You did say he was L24/25, right?  You don't need a 1200 AC
to softcap sub-30 mobs.

It's situational.  :)  The higher the twink's level the stronger
your argument becomes.  It scales with the ATK of the mobs he's
tanking.  By L45 he'll be able to have 2k-ish HP, Clerics he groups
with will have CHeal, mobs he'll tank hurt you bad unless your AC
is high (I recall getting slapped around some with an 850-ish AC,
I watched Rangers get creamed with 750-ish ACs), and he'll be able
to get full benefit from player-made and Kunark armors.
