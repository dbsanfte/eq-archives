Nope; but bards did a long time ago!
A *monk* can offer great pulling on a raid, but what about the others?  It
doesn't take 4,3, nor even 2 monks to pull the toughest GoD stuff.

We have 4 active monks, 2 to "pull", and 2 to get in the way of rogues
fighting for a spot on the mobs ass.
The second pulling monk could be (and often is) an SK, a bard, a warrior..
basically somebody with a range ability to tag a mob and not get owned by it

Basically no new discs were added (99% true)
But dics were "unbound" as you know..

Previously a warrior could go invuln, or he could go defensive. 1 or the
other, and if he chose the first he had an hour wait till he could again.

Now he can invuln for 12 seconds, and then go instantly into defensive.  I
can see why some  would consider it "weaponshield", but its not really as
good. Shorter duration, less agro built up etc would still make WS the
prefered choice (which needs its reuse time cut in half, heh)

We still use rangers for positioning mobs in Potime before engage, and even
with a ranger on rampage as opposed to a warrior, its still a better deal i
think.  I can see why rangers would think it eats into their "area" though
(but oh my, shouldn't they be glad?!  Rangers used to groan about sacrifical
WS positioning afterall =d )

Well.. bard, cleric, enc lull all still beats monk lull hands down.
20 second duration, 24 reuse means you can never lull more than 1 mob, and
you can never keep a mob perma "locked" (ie lull before the last one fades
to stop an agro)

Id love harmony =)
Monk lull is a good tool in Ldon hard (which i don't do Zzzzzz)
But as a raid tool.. it has very limited use.  Everything in yxtta is
immune, everything in uqua is too high, and mobs it does land on in ikkinz..
well, its a room of 5 mobs stood together. Lull 1 and you still chain 4, so
not really much point

Was this back when the 4damage aug was 1hand usable?
We have rogues with said ikkinz poker, and for the short time that a 4damage
aug could be put in it... well DPS was understandable out of this world, and
out of control.

It got nerfed to 1dmg now.. f rogues

We had a guild arena war last weekend (2v2).. 1 of my fights was against a
necro/ranger combo (heh)
The ranger was main healer in that combo (as obviously i went for the necro
first!)
Sylvian light (or whatever) isnt actually THAT bad of a spell.. =)

As for mana having purpose.. if all rangers didn' cry about the new AA arrow
abilities (which drained mana per shot), you would have just that!
