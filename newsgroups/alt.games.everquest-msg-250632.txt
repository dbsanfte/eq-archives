I second the saving points for poisons idea.  You will thank yourself over
and over when you don't have to farm green mobs for 8 hours just to get a
few skill ups.

Backstab will go up on it's own if you group all the time.  You could save a
few points to top it off if it seems to lag in skill.

Generally, don't use the points on combat skills unless something important
is really lagging behind.
