As a cleric, your skill in melee weapons is capped at your level * 4.

This means that when you hit level 12, your skill should start going up 
again, until it reaches 48.

I could be wrong, though, its possible that your skill cap is your level 
*4+4, in which case you should be able to get to 48 while still level 11.

You must attack blue, white, yellow, or red con mobs to get skill ups 
(Cyan mobs will also give skill ups but very rarely, and I'm not sure at 
11 you even see any cyan mobs)
