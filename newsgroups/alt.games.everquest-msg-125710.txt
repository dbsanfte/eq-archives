Ok, ok, maybe some people have been raised mormons and don't know any
better...sheesh

What I couldn't get past in reading it was at the very beginning, there's
all these letters attesting to the veracity and divinity of the writer of
the book...but the signators on the letters were close family members of the
person they were talking about.  Come on, my mom would write a letter for me
saying everything I write is the gospel truth if I asked her to.

The more I find out about mormons the less I like the religion.  The main
reason they do all the geneaology research is so they can make sure all
their ancestors are 'married into' the faith posthumously.  I'd be pretty
upset if my future grandchildren decided I was deluded and that I should be
'made a proper mormon' 10 years after I die.  Hey, I've reincarnated once
already, I'll do it again just to prevent something like that.  (found out
I'm reincarnation of my grandmother who died 20 years before I was born,
long story)
