That's about a third of what it costs to play EQ per month, not
counting ISP charges. And you can still reach most things, you just
have to do a few workarounds.

Sometimes I get the feeling I am the only one who read why he pays
6000 dollars for bandwidth instead of 600 dollars. Hint: It has to do
with all the database stuff, which has now turned into pay-per-use.
Not being able to get item lists per zone is going to bum me, but I am
capable of working around it.
I agree that the code could be better written (I actually wish he'd go
back to frames!) but I have found useful information in the 'bullshit
comments', such as how to make the coldain shawls before they got
their own listing, the problems with the shardwurm broodmother, broken
quests...
