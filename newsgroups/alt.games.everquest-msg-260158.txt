Not in Realm play, those are 100% Blizzard servers and still they get hacked 
and exploited because, frankly, Blizzard doesn't really do a good enough job 
of securing all the holes and entry points. I'm not really knocking them 
here, I've loved Blizzard games as long as you have (I was battle.net 
account #2005 on Jan 3, 1997) and I've been a big fan of theirs. That's one 
reason I was so excited about this game. But the truth is, as good as they 
are at most of the basic gameplay dynamics, they just don't have a lot of 
real-world server security experience and they've made what amount to a lot 
of noob mistakes. You're a programmer, you know the deal. A popular consumer 
game company decides suddenly to go into the secure online transactions 
business. They were noobs when they created battle.net, and it showed. 
They've come a ways since then, but in order to really address the 
architectural issues that left their systems vulnerable, they would first 
have to have stopped counting all the money that was rolling in. They chose 
not to (hard to blame them from a short-term cost/benefit standpoint) and so 
they earned their reputation of not really caring about the issues.

Understatement of the decade. WoW will be *the* target of all the battle.net 
hackers who have reigned supreme in that world. But yes, I believe that WoW 
will be harder to hack than Realm-based D2, but only because I'm *assuming* 
that they've learned something since that time and are implementing what 
they've learned, now having the opportunity to build something from the 
ground up.

Yep, let's be thankful there are choices now. ;-)
