I've really been enjoying coming here to read what people have to say 
regarding EverQuest, happenings with other MMORPGs, the notes from the 
intrepid explorers who've been playing Anarchy Online and many other 
conversations I've been reading. This newsgroup is great. I often find 
threads that are informative and I often find threads that are entertaining.
