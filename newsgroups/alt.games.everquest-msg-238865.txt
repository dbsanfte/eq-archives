After getting to login screen I actually made a High Elf, I figured I didnt
want to do alot of fighting with my Cleric just healing and HE had the most
WIS, I didn't want to run out of mana in a longer fight ;p.  I believe I am
having some STR issues at the moment but I think I will mix some Sandblasted
and Gothic steel to fix that.  I put 25 points in WIS and 5 in Dex starting
off, I know the five in dex maybe have been a bad move but dex was only 70
and I wanted to bump it up to 75.  My base WIS right now is 130.
