Clerics can't solo worth a damn, but a bard solos better and faster than 
any other class.  If your wrists can take the strain, that is.

I solo a lot.  My preferences are:

Bard: hands down the best and fastest soloer.  Once you can charm kite, 
it's off to the races.  You'll die often, but who cares since you'll 
make the xp up faster than you can believe.  Almost anything that 
doesn't summon can be eventually killed by a bard.

Necros: Other than a bard, this is the solo class of choice.  They can 
do everything.

Beastlords: Not as fast as a bard or necro, but a very capable soloer. 
I've soloed one to 64 with zero difficulty.

Wizards: Limited by mana regen, but can quadkite with the best of them. 
  Excellent soloer, but limited on how they solo.

Magician: Very capable soloers from 1-65.  After that, it slows down 
quite a bit.  They have almost no tools to solo with other than pure 
dps, but if they pick their solo spots well, they'll do great.  One of 
the few classes that can solo summoning mobs.

Enchanter: someone else who can do almost anything, but dies a lot as 
well :-)

Druids: jack of all trades, master of none.  One of the original "solo 
classes".

Shamans: Slow at soloing, but very capable.  Slow+healing+tankage = XP.

Shadowknights: if it can be feared, it can be soloed.
