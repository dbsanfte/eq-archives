True, a cleric could buy it or quest for it. However, in neither case
is he subjected to such a severe penalty for his mistake. If he
purchased it, he can sell it. If he quested for it, he can sell it,
or, if no-drop, just destroy it.

Also, for those quested items that require a bit of plat in required
material contributions, they inherently require a bit more forethought
and planning. Once you've made the initial misconception that the item
is usable by you, there are still many points along the way where you
have the opportunity to reconsider or have someone else bring the
mistake to your attentino for you.

My point is that I wish catastrophic mistakes were NOT so easy to make
due to interface quirks.
