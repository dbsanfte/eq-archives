/two thumbs up

I see the effects of informal shit-lists all the time.  In our
guild we have recruitment policy where all FT members vote at
the end of the 30 day probation.  *1* no vote means the person
doesn't get in.  A particularly problematic person from a past
guild tried to get in recently, and was guild-removed after 1
day and a slew of posts from us about his past.
