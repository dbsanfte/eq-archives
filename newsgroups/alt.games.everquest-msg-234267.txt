Had a similar problem went on tech support and was told to delete
three files eqmain / eqgfx / eq.dll. When I relogged it updated the
files everything was fine dont quote me on the file names as I am not
at my pc but if you need them I could get the correct ones if you need
them let me know. Apparently the files had become corrupt (my pc not
update of course!!!!!)
