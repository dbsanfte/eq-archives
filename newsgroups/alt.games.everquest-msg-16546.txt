I disagree ( just tossing in my 2 cents ).
If you have a relatively large guild, you can not keep track of it even by the
old pencil and paper  method.  How are you going to know who dropped out of the
guild?  I meet friends on here and lose track of them for months because they
are playing in a different part of the EQ world.  A guild leader would have to
constantly search for and bug members to know who is and is not still on.  Not
plutting a little more energy into helping people run guilds sounds counter
Verant's obvious desire to have people group.  

To the original poster, I'd highly suggest you have as one of your rules that
guild members e-mail you at least once a month.  You could have weekly guild
role calls, and if a person doesn't show within a month, you toss them from the
guild assuming they are still in the guild.  Who knows, eh?
