Thanks for the post, Lance.  I saved it in my "stuff to study as I get
older" folder.  And I have been working on my defensive skill...  Right
now at level 29 I have it 145, (same as offense), which I think is max
for my level.  At least I can't seem to get it get any higher, and I've
been letting alot of stuff beat on me.  It's nice having a pet ogre that
thinks it's important to have a well rounded master, so is willing to
watch me swing repeatedly at a bogling as it smacks me around, sometimes
for close to ten minutes at a time.  Very tedious, but I trust it will
prove useful in the future.
