Yep. Verant (back when they were still Verant) change the /con system on the
Zeks a while back to make pvp easier (white con = in range, anything else =
go look for a white con) and also to dissuade people from going around and
hunting green cons that were still in pvp range.

An additional benefit is that is all but stop the whines, post-pvp, of "U
onyl killd me bcoz UR higha lvl!!!1111111"
