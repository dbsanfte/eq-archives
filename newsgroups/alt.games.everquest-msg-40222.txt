This I have already answered many, many times.  OK, you don't agree,
fine.

Why do you question whether they will be?  We're positing a lower
level player getting access to a given item.  What, above all else,
does the lower level have less of than the higher level?  Plat, I
would submit.  If anything, I would expect *more* of the item to be
for sale, since there will be fewer people farming it to immediately
take out of circulation by giving it to an alt.

I might as well say here again that I am in total agreement that No
Drop and/or quest items should NOT be included in Warrens loot rules.

Except that many other games don't allow you to do this and no one
squawks.  And, yes, there may be no *roleplaying* reason, but there
may very well be practical ones.

VI has to balance your concern about whether this is fair to *you*
with whether this is fair to new subscribers.

I've been both places for both those things.

You are unfortunately correct.  Prior to Kunark, those people you're
talking about often crammed into South Karana and, Lord, the fights
over aviaks.  But I still remember with great fondness being level 21
or something and sitting in Runnyeye camping a BIBS, for pity's sake.
And then later being in Sol A, getting an overpull and running like
mad for the Sol B zone, only to get clobbered by kobolds.  Great times
:)

The Omen crowd doesn't know what they're missing.

I would like to see people drawn back to the dungeons, and I suspect
the people who designed them would too.  Not to be elitist, but there
will always be the vast majority who want the safest, easiest way to
level up.  But if we can entice a small percentage of the remainder
back to the dungeons, I think it might well be worth trying.
