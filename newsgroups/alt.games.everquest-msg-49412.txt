I guess I dont' even understand what your question means in this part.
There are definitely places where a single group of six can hunt well
into the fifties (Skyfire, Cobalt Scar, and Sol B come to mind) and
obviously other places where you'll want a raid force. (ToV, et. al.) As
to being "forced" to join guilds, I dont' think "forced" is the right
word, but yes, it's a multiplayer game and the guild system was built
into it for a reason.

Again, you've lost/confused me. I did 40 to 51 playing almost
continuously in a single group that rarely even had six. Usually three
or four. We found lots of places to hunt, but dungeons and outdoors. If
you are facing a zone/mob that needs more, why do you need a larger
group limit. If you need eight people, make two groups of four. What's
the big deal?
  I *will* agree that better communications are needed for multigroup
efforts, and Verant has indicated their intentions to add a "raid
channe" to the speech selections. Hopefully we'll get it soon. (With SoL
maybe?)

The big dogs get the most meat. Sorry. That's how it goes. The
uberguilds that put in the work and get organized, etc. will be the ones
to primarily get a crack at the high end content and loot most often.
Guild alliances are nothing new, and happen all the time. Our midlevel
guild is in an alliance with two others and we've managed some fair
mid-range raids. Friends of ours in a 45 to 60, but new/small guild have
allied with some other high level groups/allies to raid stuff like Kael
arena, Sirens Grotto, etc. It can and is done. You just have to get out
there and forge those types of relationships. If you are totally
unguilded and have no interest/ability to get into a guild, there's just
certain things that you're never going to do, or see, or obtain.
