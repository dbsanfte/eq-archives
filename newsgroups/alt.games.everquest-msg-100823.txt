Jazz, 
	Thanks for the insight... as on most occasions I appreciate
your input.
	 I have an OT question for your specifically....  It appears
that when you respond to a thread it starts a new one?  It has the
same title in subject.... but does not group it in the same thread....
This time is only one example, but I have seen where your response on
several occasions will start a new one..

Very weird... I'm using Agent, and don't feel the issue is being
caused by my usenet reader (but I could be wrong... been there before)

Thanks.
