Oh, thanks for bringing that up, the I'll say  F*** and S*** and B****,
etc whenever I want in public channels, there's nothing wrong with that,
there's a filter after all, and people can turn it off. Of course, you
left out the part about the filter being a piece of crap, and the
EULA(legal or ray will flame me for this) prohibits offensive or obscene
speech.  And when you were pointed in that direction, continued on your
rant about how you would speak as you wished on whichever channels you
wished.
