In EK, my druid hasn't died yet, and I was very nervous taking him in
there on Friday night. Ended up spending all weekend in there. My
enchanter died once, only because we got trained, and then added by some
high reds that resisted everything we threw at them while the cleric was
lagged to Link Death. A very fast TPW. (I sometimes think there's an invis
mob named Murphy running the zone, looking for groups in this particular
situation... talk about your WORST timing)

So Larry, if you're dieing too much, change your tactics, because
obviously you're doing something wrong. Or leave the event - no one's
making you try and participate.
