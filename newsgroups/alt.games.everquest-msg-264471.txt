That's exactly what I was just thinking.

I got into the beta on Thursday night.  I've got to say the game is a blast 
to play, but there are some significant enough problems still that I do not 
see how SOE can consider it as ready for gold.  Though to be fair, they 
haven't announced the release date yet (but it does seem telling that a 
number of retailers all just 'coincidentally' moved up their advertised 
release date by a week, all on the same day).
