I just started EQ and have a L3 bard and some questions. First, I still
haven't equipped any armor. Last time on, I tried purcasing a cloth cap and
equipping it, but it wouldn't let me. Said something about that my
class/race/deity would not allow me to. But all online resources say cloth
caps can be used by all. My character is a half-elf under the god of
pleasure/mischeif deity. The same happened when I tried to equip some cloth
pants. Is there something I am overlooking? I get the message when I open my
inventory and attempt to drag the equipment into the appropriate slot (cap
to head or pants to legs).

Also, is 'twisting' just alternating between multiple songs so that all the
effects stick at once for a prolonged period of time? So then you just keep
cycling?

Thanks!
