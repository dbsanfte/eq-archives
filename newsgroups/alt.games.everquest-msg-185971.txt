I think if you searched hard enough, youd find that titles are against the
naming conventions. Othewise youll get smartasses calling themselves "Lord",
"Saint" and even sillier and more confusing things such as "Guard",
"Bouncer", Dragoon" etc etc. "Squire" I admit is pretty harmless, but the
line has to be drawn somewhere. You could always get someone to petition
"Smire" for you... doesnt it mean something obscene in some obscure
language? ;)
