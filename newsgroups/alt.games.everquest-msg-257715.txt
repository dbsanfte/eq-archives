The interesting thing is that all of the cards giving problems with fog
in game are not capable of running DX9.  THat being the case you should
be looking at Radeon cards from 9500 up and Nvidia cards from 5200 up.
Obviously the higher cards have best performance and the lower cards
can best be described as slugs.

There are good deals at the moment starting to appear on the less than
high end cards because both makers have just put out new high ends.

Value for money would probably be the Radeon 9800 Pro card atm.
