"When  asked  if  he  takes  into  account  consumer input Flock is
dismissive,  relying instead on the expertise of his staff. 'No, we
never talk to consumers - they just f--- us up. Someone asked for a
copy  of  our market research which made us take the decision to do
EverQuest.  I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done,
the game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers
don't  know  what  they  want.  We just want to know if they have a
valid credit card.'"

Pretty substantial for something that "never happened."  :)
