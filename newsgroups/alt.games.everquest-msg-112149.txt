Okay, taking my newbie warrior derv hunting in NRo. It's an old
stand-by, but it works. I do the LFG thing and eventually get a tell
asking if I want to start a wall group from a necro my level (12). We
meet up and start looking out for a healer to hook up with us so we
can get going. Eventually, we decide to risk the pull. He feared away
two while I tanked down one at a time best I could. I survived this
barely, but the camp was broken. Now a healer comes along and hooks
up, so we should be good to go, right? We were for a while.

Things started going south. Healer went off to sell. Little
inconvenient, but no biggies since the camp was broken. Then a thug
pops. I sit down and tell my group it's red. After a minute, necro
says "ill dot and fear it we can take it." I think for a moment and
decide what the heck. "Mmkay, you ready for it?" The necro's reply is
"inc" as he pulls it. Well, it started out okay, he had it darknessed
and feared. Then fear wore off. As I was wearing down on HP expecting
another fear, I notice the necro isn't even trying to cast anything.
I'm at half a bubble, he finally casts......lifetap. Then I found
myself naked at my bind point.

A basic run down of the conversation to follow:

Me: Refreshing fear would have been good.
Him: it's red it resists a lot
Me: You didn't even attempt. Only thing you cast was lifetap right
before I died, that didn't do me any good.
Him: if u were wise you would have backed up and let my pet tank when
u low hp and let my pet tank. its not like i could heal u
Me: If you were wise, you would have at least tried to keep it feared
like you said you were going to.
Him: u wanted to pull it dont blame ur death on me. learn to play
Me: ME learn to play? You're the one who didn't do what you said you
were going to.
Him: i said id dot and fear it i didnt say continuous
Me: How convenient. Moron.

...../disband. /ignore necro. Go loot my corpse then /camp
