Recently I aquiered my friends account with a lvl 30 chanter on it.. The account or atleast the characters on it are of no use to me. I would like to transfer one of my characters from my main account to the newly aquiered account. I updated all the expansions on both accounts. Did my app on EQ's website and a few days later got a reply from Customer service telling em that it can't be done. The reason is that I was not the original owner of the new account. I sent them a reply informing them that it was my friends and I had all the information they needed. even my friend said he would e-mail them and give thme any information needed to make this happen but still couldn't get it done.

Anyways basicly what i'm trying to ask is how can I get my charcter from one account to the other if the second account I'm trying to transfer to didn't originally belong to me. 

Thanks in advance and excuse the spelling/grammer.
