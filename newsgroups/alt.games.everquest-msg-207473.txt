In a word, yes.

I'm a warrior, so it's arrows only, and I don't have any of the special
tricks like harmony, pacify or FD that others get.   But at the same time, I
would pull a lot for our little group, and I got so that I was pretty good,
if I do say so myself.  My warrior could pull better than some monks I know,
and many rangers.

It's not something I can really put into words, although I'll try.   If
you'll forgive a little pretension, it's almost more of an artform than a
skill.  After a while you get a sense for what your aggro range is.  You
learn exactly how far you can stand from a mob without it aggroing, you get
a sense for how far apart a mob has to be from it's fellows to not chain
aggro to them.   Where to position yourself so that  you're only close to
the mob that you're shooting at, and at maximum distance from every other
mob in the camp.   How to shoot and then get further out of range before the
arrow strikes home.  How the mob will path to get to you, which one has the
least amount of time running near the unpulled mobs of that camp.

And still, every so often you end up running back to the group with all 6 on
your tail, typing "inc FUN".   At which point theres not much you can do
besides shrug and say "I had to do it!  Mynar was looking bored!"  (the
enchanter)

Yes.  I can't remember the last time I fought a truly non-social mob.

Yes, the first door is two way (and only unlocked because you're not
supposed to be able to get up to it.)   But the room it leads to is very
small.   You might be able to get away with fighting in the center of it at
60, but when we were there (usually with at least 1 mid 50's in group)
fighting in the center would bring anything that got left behind on the
pull.  All four mobs at once.   Only fighting at the back part would avoid
that.   And the back part might be off limits to you due to the mortiforous
on the other side of the one way (not sure if he'll aggro on a room fight or
not, he was always dead before we cleared that room.)

We always had a druid.  Our usual group was a Druid, Enchanter, Warrior.
Generally with a Rogue and Paladin.   For the sixth it was sometimes a
shaman, sometimes a cleric, and sometimes a second rogue.   (For HS we
almost always waited for the rogue to be on.  You can do the key corpse
thing, but it gets old real fast.)

Thats pretty much what I was thinking.   If they fixed it so HS was a good
exp zone again, it's really easy to suggest that the group work it's way in
to X location, "as long as we're here." ... well, depending on how competent
they are. ; )    Even if Sony left the zone at the current levels though,
you won't get down to Drusilla with just the two of you.



Hmm....  I just realized you were talking about going for quest drops other
than Drusilla.    I guess with your other post about the angry goblin, I
just assumed you would be after her for the final part of the Chardok quest.
What you're doing is much easier.   We destroyed so many of those iksar
skull thingies that I can't even come close to remembering them all.

If you added a rogue and enchanter / bard, the four of you could easily do
south wing until you got it.
