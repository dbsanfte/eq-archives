For now: Don't DoT adds.  Always assist the tank.  /assist off.  Always 
snare everything (without pulling aggro).  Don't root mezzed mobs, you'll 
break the mez with the damage your root does.

For later: Don't load your stun procs unless you're tanking.  Always be 
aware of everything that's about to come into your LOS when shooting 
arrows; if your target is moving around a lot and there are mezzed mobs 
nearby, switch to melee.  Don't be afraid to load jolting blades if your 
tank's aggro sucks; better to lose a little DPS from your procs than run 
the cleric OOM throwing you heals.
