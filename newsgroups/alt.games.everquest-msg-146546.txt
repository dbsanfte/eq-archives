Some time ago, in an age long gone, we had real toys. We had guns
which shot often semi pointed projectiles, we had an EXCELLENT toy
called the "Creepy crawler factory" which was essentially a VERY hot
plate with some rubber goop and molds, we had woodburning sets, we had
a cool series of Mr. Potato head figures with actual bodies (mr
pepper, mr cucumber, etc) Kids learned responsibility partially from
the danger factor of these toys, which mirrored the danger of real
life. Though they had very clear age markings, sometimes some not very
swift kid would injure his eye or burn himself or something, or
swallow or lodge the small parts of the Mr. Potato Heads in their
throat or nose. The bandage or patch told the other kids to stay the
heck away from this kid because he was stupid. No plastic bags had "Do
not put this on your head and suffocate yourself, you stupid ass
moron!", because we were either smart enough not to or had parents to
teach us that. Some idiots got injured or died but this is called
evolution, their gene pool was obliterated which is a good thing.

Eventually parents got the bright idea that they no longer needed to
be parents, they let the schools raise their kids and both had full
time jobs. This made the idiot kids multiply and eventually you had
some law suits. The creepy crawler was removed and replaced by a half
assed one that had a light bulb with less toxic goop, but I think some
kid still managed to set something on fire with that because it also
disappeared. Fun guns and slingshots disappeared, along with anything
that was semi toxic if ingested. 

This ushered in a very bleak period for those who played with toys.
Toys became uber safe and boring as hell. Even such mundane things as
hard footballs and baseballs were under the gun. This is when someone
got a bright idea and "Nerf" was born.

Nerf was a series of toys, beginning with a sponge ball and a heavier
sponge football aI think, which were soft and designed so that idiots
could not injure themselves or others as easily while parents could be
off working or getting drunk. Since they were not taken out of the
game early, or learned a lesson, these idiot kids grew up to instead
kill people in drunk driving accidents or impale themselves on farm
machinery. 

Eventually people waxed nostaligic for projectile launcher toys so
nerf reinvented those also, with some big sponge projectile. These are
actually pretty fun though while nearly impossible to injure yourself
on. In the future I think all children will be enclosed for 24 hours a
day in some large nerf ball, totally safe from all danger. They will
be "weaned" at the age of 18 from the ball enviornment and unleashed
upon the world having no idea how to function in it.
