Im a level 10 ranger and new to everquest. This is my first week playing and
im trying to level. I am looting in black burrow and cant venture far by
myself. I am killing, selling, going back, and killing more to get better
weapons and armour. I watch some hit gnolls for 30 and 40 damage, one guy
for 110 points of damage. I am whacking away for 13 and a kick for 8. In 2
days ive accumilated 22 plat. I think I am missing something, does anyone
have any idea what I can do better?
