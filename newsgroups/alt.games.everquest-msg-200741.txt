And they'll quickly level out of it to an appropriate level
where KEI isn't that big of an advantage.  So what's the
problem?  Just because it's not how you want to play
doesn't mean it is wrong.  I'd think you'd be happy to
have them move on as fast as possible.

I'll also point out that a good group of experienced players
playing alts can routinely take higher-level mobs simply
because they understand game mechanics and their roles.
Is your next argument going to be that it's "unfair for any
experienced player to play an alt?"
