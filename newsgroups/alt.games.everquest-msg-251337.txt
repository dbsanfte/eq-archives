I dont see it as so easy.  For example the normal going price for a Winblade
is 30k.  Now this is a weapon with a lot of hype.  And maybe the hype is
justifyed and maybe its not.  Now im probably not going to ever get a
Winblade for 10k or less so I have to ask my self is it realy worth it?
Maybe it is but how do I realy know unless I buy one.  It would be real
disapointing if it wasnt as hot as the hype and i found that the Winblade
compared to the Argent Protector was only marginaly better and I had spent
30k to find out.  So the issue realy is how can i find out?  In the real
world I can test drive a car before I buy it.  I have 30 days to return my
laptop to Circuit City if I dont like it.  And then there are service
agreements and warrenties. But in eq there is no way to do the same.
Someone isnt going to tell you hey try this winblade out for a month and if
you dont like it just bring it back for a full refund.  Ya right.  So a site
showing the weapon in actual performance, that is to say Actual parsed logs
and calculated dps from those logs would be a great help to me and everyone
else to make that decision and thus helping to control price inflation.  And
when some Joker starts telling me that his weapon is greater than it realy
is I can say sry bud check the performance posts on this thing its only
marginaly better than this other one thats alot less and so on.  After a
while the performance posts would become the oficial facts of a weapon and
would stabalize price inflation  This is how real life works so why wouldnt
it work in eq?
