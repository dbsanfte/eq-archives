At least it wasn't completely wasted. What if you decided to roleplay
a great general and threw it all into int or cha?

For the record, my first long term main was a warrior, and I put all
her points that I could into Agi. This was in summer of 1999 when we
knew far less about stats and their effects, of course. I don't so
much regret that as I do spending so much time accumulating gear that
focused on stats, especially str, dex, and agi, over AC or hp. I wore
two of those serpentine bracers from LG for god's sake... and they
were considered valuable! I whined because we went something like
fourteen Skarlon kills between mithril leg drops and I wanted to
complete my set. Oh yes, mithril armor was uber back then. All that
agi on the bp... yum!

Oh, in case you think I was just a dumb newbie who didn't know
better... I was in the top guild on the server at the time and there
were only two or three warriors who got to 50 earlier. :-p We *all*
thought that way at the time. We would wisen up soon enough.

Ironically, my very very first character, at release, was a paladin...
and he put everything into Sta. And was told I should have put it all
into Str. So I could handle the weight of the store bought steel plate
armor.

Prehistoric EQ!

Just imagine a time machine that would allow you to take a character
from today back in time to the summer of 1999. Even one of my current
active twinks, a ranger sitting at L51, would be viewed as a god among
children.
