It can be multiquested, btw. Might try asking around to see if anyone
else has the missing piece. That person doesn't even have to be in the
group getting flagged, whichever group turns in the last piece gets
flagged. Also, Each of the 4 Daiku seem to have exactly one spawn
point (PH) so make sure you're hunting in the right part of the desert
for the one that you're missing. ... Ignore me if I'm stating the
obvious here <g>. 

... did I mention that Tactics actually has loot? :p It's rare but
comes at 15k a drop for highly polished gems.

I don't think I've done any serious soloing for exp since 60th lvl.
I'll occasionally solo for loot or just to see if I can take a mob but
it just hasn't seemed like efficient exp for quite a while. Plus, once
you hit 100AAs, why bother? Handy info to have though, I'll check the
place out. I do often hunt in a duo or trio and sometimes it's nice to
know a couple of easy spots for groups like that.
