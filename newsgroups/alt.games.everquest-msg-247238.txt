Well.. assuming an untwinked specimen.. .sure. If your fighting for
your gear then yeah LDoN's are the place to go. For the twinked(pretty
much most), you do yourself a lot of benefit just blowing through the
levels at the ZEM spots, especially when the gear you really want
drops in the later easies, is usually pretty reasonably priced due to
drop rate, and usually has decent stats for recommended items starting
in the 50-55 range. Do you get less pp? sure.. but it'll take you
much, MUCH less time to level up. I'm still not sold on the fact that
xp in ldon's is faster then traditional xp, especially given the down
time, and i would be shocked if that were the case. And for classes
that can solo i'm sure we can agree it isn't the case.

But for the first time player, starting from scratch.. yeah.. have fun
in the ldon's and take your time in general levelling up.
