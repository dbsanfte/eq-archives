Really, what the hell's the difference? If the mob's standing, it's
alive. If it's not, it's dead. Why do you need to see 1% hp to know
it's alive?

It's not rounded down until the mob drops below 0.5% anyway. Now
you're just nitpicking because your stupid nitpick got slapped in the
face. Give it up.
