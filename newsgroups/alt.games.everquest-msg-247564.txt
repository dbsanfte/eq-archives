Common courtesy is taking one of the most popular low level camps all for
yourself with a high level, to "twink" your low level alt? Nice
rationalizing there sir. Fact is you were an egocentric bastard for not
helping them killing mobs and getting exp in exchange for the rare drop, or
joining them with your low level alt. Coming here to get support for being a
lamer is just pathetic. Killfiling people who don't agree even more so. I
hope you killfile me too, would prove my point.
