Thoe only "attack" on muslims, is from un-informed ignorant persons.  In
the USA, we have "freedom to practice our respective religions".  As a
part of that, the USA DoD provides Religious services for very nearly
any religious group who requests it.  That includes Islam.  Therefore,
at this moment, the Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Airmen who are
preparing to prosecute this action include Muslims.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
