How are the drop rates though?  My (giant faction) guild has been farming 
ToV for the quest armor and I see 7 plate BPs in the past 4.5 months.  
Every time you kill Trak, even spawned Trak for bard epic, he drops at 
least one BP.  We've probably received 20 BPs from Trak in the time we 
received those 7 chain BPs.

Well, I wouldn't say that.  You make a Trak run, you know he'll drop a BP 
or two, if he doesn't drop you first.  From my experience, the drop rates 
for the Velious quest armor componants are terribly slow.  We're probably 
dropping 30+ mobs a night in ToV and we just don't see many BPs.  We have 
several Trak BPs sitting in the bank.
As to the toughness of Trak, he's not a pushover, but he's not bad for a 
big dragon.  Need to get your PR up to good levels, but it's not like he 
gives people fits or anything.  
The Overking is tough, just because Chardok is an unforgiving zone.  You 
need a very good puller.  Once you break into the Library though, you're 
pretty much set.  The royals respawn in two hours, so you can set up and 
farm.  I wouldn't want to do King with 2 groups, but 3-4 groups shouldn't 
be a big problem.
