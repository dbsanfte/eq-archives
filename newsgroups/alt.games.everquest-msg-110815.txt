Have had no troubles installing and running XP since December of last year when
I first installed EQ trilogy and Luclin.  Now, all of a sudden, it no longer
runs - crashes to desktop when trying to enter the game with a character.  I
tried doing a full file scan and that didn't help.  I uninstalled it and tried
reinstalling and now it won't even install.  It either just terminates with some
odd error with no description, or when reading from the cd it says file crc
mismatch and won't continue.  I have two copies of each and both get the same
results.  Any ideas?  Is my mobo ide controller fried or something?  Anyone else
have this happen all of a sudden under XP?
