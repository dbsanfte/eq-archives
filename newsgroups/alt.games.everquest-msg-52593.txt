Noticed a new DE wandering around aimlessly in SRO today too named
Izera N'Kar. When hailed she fingers her dagger and says something 
like "Ah! High Elf, good for you I don't need any of that today!".
She doesn't agro, is easily snared, my biggest nuke of 1200 damage
hardly scratches her and she doesn't attack back at all. 
 
 Weird stuff going on lately. I better go buy one of those new
newspapers.
