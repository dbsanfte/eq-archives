anyone ever seent his guy before in Befallen?
i _think_ he's a dwarf cleric. he spawns in priest amaiz's room. he's
lying on the floor pretending to be dead, if you hail him he calls you
slimey and says to go away. when you kuill him you get a message along
the lines of "lino jinglebell's body is whicked away to a different
plane of existance" the body doesnt decay so u can have multiple dead
bodies on the ground. you have to kill/taunt him real fast when he
respawns or he just falls down, doesn't drop anything atall.
 my friend and i have been in befallen before and haven't seen this
npc before, anyone out there can fill me in on him?
btw, i forgot to write his name down so "lino jinglebell" might not be
exact :)
