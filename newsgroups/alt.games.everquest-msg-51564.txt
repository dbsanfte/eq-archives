Actually you can get more damage for your mana out of thorns than its
possible to get out of dot. healing can be soaked up for little cost using
treeform, and the odd regen. You dont have to root to make your dots work at
full effect.
If you have the armor to make it work, I think you can make it quicker than
just snare/root/dot. I wasnt twinked, but I bought cheap armor class items,
and It worked for me. After I passed level 35 I couldnt handle the damage
from any blue mobs i could find tho.

Now, at 55, I have 2 basic options for solo... root kiting and quad kiting.
