-I am definitely upgrading to a P4 1.7 and 512 ram...but I think what they
-consider the minimum requirements to be are higher than what is listed.

You would prolly get a faster machine and spend less money if you go for 
an AMD Athlon. Get the new board that supports DDR RAM. 
I used to insist on Intel CPUs too, but after setting up a pc for a 
friend with Athlon, I'm completely sold on AMD. My AMD1700 (which 
actually clocks at about 1.56 GHz) is as fast as a P4-2000, but costs a 
lot less, and DDR is cheaper than RDRAM too.
