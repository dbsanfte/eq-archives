which translates to being able to main slower -- a vital role

they beat the hell out of rangers for offtanking, heh....anyone who can take
hits is useful, and beasts do it very very well

so he can be a tank with good dps (a rare thing to see)

for a hybrid, beasts can nuke very well .. . it's kind of just a side thing,
no one goes "ooh dont take that ranger, take the beast - for his NUKES!"
(they take the beast because of everything else <g> )

having a class-specific buff (that everyone wants) is a sure way to get a

everyone loves haste/crack...beastlords, on the other hand, are basically a
pocket shaman

pocket shaman!
