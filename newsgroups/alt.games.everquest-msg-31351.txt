Holy crap, surely you're not serious! You can't be that stupid, can
you? You're citing Arpanet RFCs in support of your claim that spoofing
is illegal?

You don't even know what "spoofing" means!

"Spoof - To capture, alter, and retransmit a communication stream in a
way that misleads the recipient. As used by hackers, refers especially
to altering TCP/IP packet source addresses or other packet-header data
in order to masquerade as a trusted machine. This term has become very
widespread and is borderline techspeak."

"lokari@_nospam_lokari.net" doesn't even come close to qualifying as
spoofing, nor does an RFC come close to a statement of law.

Here's some news for you - you're really really bad at this game, and
the longer you play, the dumber you look.
