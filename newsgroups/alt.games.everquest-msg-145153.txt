Good day EQ'ers :) Can anyone recommend something for this set up?
I use
2X Orc Fang Earrings
Spider Fur Collar
Kobold Jesters Crown
Enshrouded Veil
Spider Fur cloak
Acrylia reinforced tunic
Acrylia reinforced sleeves
Seahorse spine bracelet
Flowing Black Silk Sash
Drovarg Mantle
Serpentine Bracer
Shissar scaled gauntlets
Velium fire wedding ring X2
Gatorscale Leggings
Footpads of the tiger
Goranga Idol

I use an Imbued Fighters Staff

My stats (with gear) is
STR= 135
STA= 107
AGI= 116
DEX= 93
WIS= 94
INT= 52
CHA= 115

Im sure i must have some mistakes in my current gear. I have about 6k to
spend but dont really fancy blowing it all on 1 item... does anyone have any
suggestions? Also, is it better to use my IFS or to dual wield a Jade Mace
and Knuckle dusters?

p.s. dont point me toward Mangelo profiles or anything as for some reason i
cannot view the site... comes up with boxes all over the screen :(

Many Thanks,
