From what I understand this does sound good for lower levels 
(If you do _all_ of the maths)

I saw a comment on here a few weeks ago that there was an xp cap applied
too
The post was vague about how the cap was applied it was either :

1) That there is a multiplyer applied to the xp based on the difference
between the highest person in the group's level and the Mobs level. So
that if the Mob is blue to the High level person then a 0.75 multiplier
is applied first. Thus meaning that the lowest level person gets "less"
xp that they would have in a group of lower level characters.

2) That there is a cap to the amount of xp that a PC can get from one
mob. So that if the group was 40/60 and took out a mob of level 55
(unlikely I know). The level 40 PC would only get xp as if the mob was a
"high red to him" level (e.g. 45/6/7). And then would only get 40% of
that.

Like I say I can NOT confirm any of this.
Has any one else heard anything to either of these effect ?
Do they make any sense ?
Or can you blow them out of the water ?

If anyone knows anything or can refute these please post.

Cheers,

Jim
