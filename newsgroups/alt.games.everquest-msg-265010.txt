I played a rogue in EQ1 up to 46 and used the usual weapons. I'm looking at
going down the Scout route in EQ2 but I have a weapon question.

I saw via the official site what weapons (at least some) that a Scout can
use. I've also seen via videos from various places that Scouts seem to be
dual wielding this and that. My question is are you locked into "most
effective" weapon choices like EQ1. For instance will my Scout be just as
effective in combat if he used a staff versus going with a dual wielding EQ1
Ranger/Rogue combo.

I'm asking because now that the EQ2 info floodgates have opened I am having
a tough time deciding what to play. As stated above the Scout route seemed
interesting with the goal being Ranger and I was thinking a Bow/Staff combo
would be nice. Any handicap in this?

So bottomline are there "EQ1-like" weapon restrictions in EQ2? For instance
you'd never see a Rogue or Ranger in EQ1 using a staff even though if
would've been neat.

Thanks.
