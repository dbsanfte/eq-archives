Not much oppurtunities to swim in FoB,Kurns,Maru Seru
and Ldon.
After 5 years online playing,training mindlessly skills
doesnt appeal to me anymore,can you say boring?
Last attempt on raising swimming on my Ranger 65,125
swimming,I gave up after 15 minutes without skillgain,
wondering what I was doing here and if this is entertaining.

And I am not the kind of person who plays afk.  :)

Meldore 53 Paladin (0 swimming)
Meldur 	55 Druid     (22 swimming)
Uland	65 Hunter  (127 swimming)
