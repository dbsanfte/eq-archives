 I just got into Wow (14 day trial) and am just learning the mechanics
(talent builds and the like) so the changes shouldn't both me much as
I'll probally die just as much as I did before. :)

 Its pissed off the veterans of Wow just like some of Soe's decisions
with EQ vets.

 Its a pity companies can't leave what works alone and fix whats
broken. Of course that means no $$$ brought in for the newest
expansion.
