There is nothing cranially challenged about interpreting the message: 
"It looks pretty even, you might win", as a suggestion that you've got 
over all the creatures that con this way a 50/50 shot at taking them solo.

Working as intended? How do you know? Who seriously beleives the 
'intent' was to display inaccurate messages that would lead new players 
to die pointlessly while they learned to ignore the semantics of the 
messages and just take the various messages as an additional clue to 
relative level. The reality is that blues can be 'small', 'medium', or 
'large', etc, and from the text you can discern what they are. But we'd 
get the same amount of information without the confusion if the message 
was just 'small', 'medium', or 'large'...
