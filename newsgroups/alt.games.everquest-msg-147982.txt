All of the TS rogue quests are not worth the time.  There is
not a single piece that is better than a combination of
Ry'Gorr and/or Ravenscale, even the non-visible pieces.

And the weapon is a piece of poop.  Burning Rapier/EBW
is a much better combo, and getting the EBW at level
30ish or so is a decent "sneak in" quest if you have the
components.
