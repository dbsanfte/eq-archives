If the warrior paid another player to cast them on him, then, yes.  The
warrior is using the means at his disposal, platinum, to purchase a service
within the game from another player.

For that matter, even if he didn't pay for it, it's still soloing, just with
some serious buffage.

At what point do you draw the line?

Can a person only use the items he has looted to still be considered
soloing?

Is it OK if he just buys/is given items that are level appropriate?

Is it OK if he is buffed with level appropriate spells only?

In the end, who really cares?  The enchanter gets what he wants out of the
transaction, namely cash, the persion with KEI gets what he wants out of it,
an awesome buff that will help him both in soloing and grouping.

And, just to add to this, I do not turn down lower level enchanters for a
group just because I already have KEI going, they are still extremely handy
to have around for other purposes, such as crowd control.  Not to mention,
the sooner I get another enchanter up to 60, the more likely there is to be
another enchanter out there to cast KEI.  :b
