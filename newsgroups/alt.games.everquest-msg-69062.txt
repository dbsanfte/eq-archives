  What you pay to play has nothing to do with it.  Everybody on
Firiona Vie has to play by the same ruleset as you.  Complaining that
you don't get to loot things because of TLC on Firiona Vie despite
paying as much to play on somebody on another server, would be like
complaining that you can't kill other PCs on blue servers despite the
fact that players on PvP servers can kill each other and pay than you.

  Also, it's not as if TLC is something to be taken as a personal
affront.  Just because there's a camera in a convenience store doesn't
mean that the store management is treating you like you "might be a
criminal".  It's just an impersonal, evenly enforced way of detering
people from behavior that has been deemed potentially harmful to the
environment.

  I'm not the hugest fan of TLC, and wouldn't be too sad to see it
gone on FV, but I do like the fact that virtually no items are NO
DROP.  Afterall, the concept of an item being NO DROP doesn't make any
more sense from an "in game" perspective than TLC.  I'm willing to
give the ruleset a chance.  If it does turn out to be an effective
measure against farming, I think I can tolerate the downsides it has,
especially if Verant will adjust certain quests so some of them can be
a bit more realistically completed on FV.  If it turns out being
ineffective against farming, I say get rid of it.

  Well, you could be a half-elf, or better yet, a half-elf rogue.
Then you could communicate with 90% of the people in your newbie area,
and probably more than 50% of the people you encounter elsewhere.  I
wouldn't have implemented the language barrier had I been in Verant's
shoes, but it's something you can get around with a little persistance
and ingenuity most of the time.  And learning languages on FV is still
practical, it's just more time consuming.  After a roughly hour long
training session, my erudite could speak Dark Elven well enough that I
can understand everything dark elves say and it seems they can pretty
much flawlessly understand me as well.
