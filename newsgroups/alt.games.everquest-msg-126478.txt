The character select screen is all new. Perhaps some people don't care
for the spinning. There must have been a need for it or it probably
wouldn't have been added. They also added a 'Explore' button which lets
you run around in the mini-zone you're in. No real point but kinda
interesting. I think the new character selection/creation screens are
nicely done.

Maybe not enough. But more than we had. I have no complaints about that.
