Where is a good place to hunt for mob dropped monk gear?  My monk is
just now 65 but the last time I played him was well over a year ago
(maybe 2).  His gear is nowhere near what today's 65 monk is wearing.

I have a small group that can help me but no raid level gear is
possible for me atm.  I've talked to a few monks and it looks like my
gear is comparable to low-50's monks today.  Any suggestions?

Thanks.
