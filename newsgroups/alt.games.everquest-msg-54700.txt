 I waited until after level 30. At that point I went to Velious, and
travelled back to Kunark at 35 to get riposte. There are several good
reasons for waiting this long. By the time you get to level 30 you'll be
able to soak up enough damage to be able to feign in time when you have a
little KOS "misunderstanding". You'll also have gotten your increase in
weight you can carry, so you'll be better able to equip yourself for travel
(and to get loot) when you are far from a friendly bank (Velious is nice
because it has two that you can use right from the start, one in Thurgadin
and one at the bottom of Crystal Caverns...which is where you should head
after you hit thirty. Get a bind in Thurgadin first though).
 There is good hunting in Kunark. Once you hit 25 you should be living in
Dalnir, hoping to get some batons and maybe picking up some crescent armor
(I got lucky and a high level paladin let me loot some off his kills...it's
monk only no drop, so this happens quite a bit)
 Post 35 is when you're really free. You'll have all your skills, so you'll
be free to wander Norrath laying the scaley smack-down on whatever you wish.
