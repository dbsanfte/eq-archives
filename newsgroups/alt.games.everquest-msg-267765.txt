Find a blue group single up arrow creature that you can kill solo and
camp them for a few days. You should be able to get 2-3% per mob
(since it's group) and a good shot and some loot chests. You should be
able to get a few books for brokering and several pieces of armor
which go for multiple silver each. :)

Quests are overrated, IMO. I suggest only doing the ones that result
in armor/weaponry that you can actually use, and just doing the xp
grind the rest of the time. No wasted time loading the same areas over
and over.

I'd offer a few suggestions for mob campsites, but I'm from Qeynos.
