    I'll go with "quite a long time depending on the person playing the
toon". I've posted the exact names of people on my server that have
E-Bay'ed, including characters with Best of the Best titles. They aren't
banned. Think about it: if I went to Playerauctions right now and posted
your account for sale (using your Magelo for details), at the same time as
you switched ISPs, how could Verant distinguish that from an actual account
sale?
