It would amount to the same thing, since classes all gain meditation at the
same rate. Some classes get it at higher or lower levels than others, but
once they DO get it, the caps are identical. The only way a skill level of
meditation requirement would be any different from a level requirement is
if the skill level was VERY low, so the wizard who starts medding at 4 will
lose the book at 7th, where the shaman/druid (who get the meditate skill at
level 8) will need to wait until it gets to the same point value as the
wizard (since they have a level 8 cap, and the book goes away at level 7,
as soon as they get the skill, they are eligable to lose the book...just
need the patience to wait for the skill to increase sufficiently).
