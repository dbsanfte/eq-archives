Ok, I'll grant you that.  A Fighter/Rogue (or Ranger/Rogue) seems to be
pretty much the ultimate solo char.  With fairly even level split you
can get into anywhere and, depending on your gear, fight anything.  But,
in a server vault campaign built by somebody intelligent enough to
understand this, it is very easily controlled by (1) strictly limiting
the availability of scrolls/wands, and (2) making very liberal use of
alignment restrictions on all items, and (3) making +CHA items very rare
(warn the players, Sorcerors/Bards and to some degree Paladins/Clerics
ought to know that they won't easily overcome a low CHA via items).  If
If you move firmly away from the solo-RPG worldview where any char can
trivially become an overwhelmingly powerful generalist via item use
you'll see people forming parties of varied classes.  But I don't see
how any amount of "class balancing" could ever overcome the horribly
deep flaws of NWN's local vault server model.
