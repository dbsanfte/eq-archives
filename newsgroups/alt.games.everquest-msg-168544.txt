If you take my views, twist them 90 degrees to adjust for the fact that, by
"Conservative" I am referring to the views of the conservative movement in
America, and by "Liberal" I am referring to the views of the leftist
movement in America, do they make more sense?

Consider that the left has abandoned it's libertarian heritage and no longer
supports a free-market policies, you could say that American politics has
almost exactly flip-flopped in it's basic views from those of the founding
fathers.  What Adams and Hamilton would call "liberal" is no conservative,
and vice versa.
