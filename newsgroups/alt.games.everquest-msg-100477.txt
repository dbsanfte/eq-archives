Well put.  I think the bottom line though, is if Verant would be nice enough
to put a mana bar in the group health bar area, maybe non-casters could get
an idea of how much snares/nukes/heals/ use in mana, plus clear up the
confusion over pulls.  Can you imagine how hard a job the healer had if you
had to wait for the tanks to /gsay 15% health.  HELP!

Still dreaming of a group mana bar,
SEAN...

Oh yeah.  I find groups without a hitch and never heard anyone bitch about
me not knowing how to play.  In fact, I hear quite the opposite.  Not too
bad for a newbie.
