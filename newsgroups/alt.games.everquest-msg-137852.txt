Oh man it was the funniest shit i've seen in so long, i was laughing so hard
i was getting a headache.

Guildie_01 hoaxes the message, "You have gained experience"  (yellow text,
on a new line etc, as it should be)
Guildie_02 says, "WTF?!  I just logged in the bazaar and got exp for no
reason"
We say, "Yeah its a new bug.. people are getting some exp every time they
log in
Guildie_02 says "wow, im gonna relog a few times! I could do with a few more
aa levels"
Queue hysterical laughter

Then Guildie_01 sends a hoax message (not sure to people in kael, to the
whole guild)
The Avater of War executes a FLURRY of attacks on Guildie_02's corpse!
Guildie_02 says, "What the fuck!!! the AoW did NOT just kill me!!!!"

Some guildies were exping in Kael, and just about crapped their pants when
they saw that,  classic :)

Fake GM messages, "bla bla all zones coming down for 20 minutes".

My personal favourite, "LeadGM_whoever says Well folks, after a marvelous 3
years... EQ is finally coming to an end at 04:00cst hours.   It has been a
fantastic success and we look forward to seeing you in the next adventure!
Thank you for playing Everquest and making it what it was, see you in part
2!"

The bazaar was in absolute disarray at that point... kinda evil I know, but
by god was it funny.

Guildies who hadn't caught onto it were getting freaked out, we were almost
crying with laugter

"King Tormax goes on a RAMPAGE"  in red text, in Dreadlands.. hehe, fake
/guildsay gay admissions from our wizards etc.. I've never laughed so much
in all my time of EQ.

It obviously had a very malicious side to it.. and you could also LD people
and crash zones with it.  One person did a spoof /shout in the Bazaar, and
sent 200 people link dead LOL.

Glad to see it fixed though.
