Sites To Know:
www.eqatlas.com - Maps
www.allakhazam.com - Treasure and Monsters
eq.castersrealm.com - Class info, spell lists

What class are you playing?

There is at least 1 good website for class info for each individual class 
in the game.

home. I just gave up after a while. I figure if I want to talk
to me, I'll just have to do it in person.)" -Walker
