Try this in the bazaar.  Go into the middle building and face toward
the pile of players that are always bunched up near the bank.  Even
though there's a wall between you and the pile, you will still get
frame rate reduction.   Now face the wall directly opposite the
opening in the building (the one that connects the Nexus and SH
entrances).  You will notice a large improvement in the frame rate
because there are no or few players in that direction.

That said, the clip plane definitely helps, as many of the pixels
beyond the plane will not be drawn.

Basically, the current engine renders everything between your current
viewing angle, and the clip plane.  Sort of a pyramid shaped volume
with your eye being at the apex.

What they need to do is implement a sort of "dynamic clip plane" where
pixels nearer to the eye occlude the farther pixels.  This can be done
with sorting by depth, but that requires quite a lot of overhead too.

From my understanding, the new graphics engine removes the texture
maps for many surfaces and replaces them with functions that generate
the textures.  It's supposed to be faster, and consume less memory.  I
don't know if they are going to do anything about the occlusion
problem, though.  Maybe with the faster texturing, that will be enough
to increase the frame rate beyond "slideshow" mode in the bazaar for
most players.
