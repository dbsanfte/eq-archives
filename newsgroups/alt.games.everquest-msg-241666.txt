I'd say no... EQ runs a lot smoother on my machine than Galaxies these days,
though that may be a detail thing (you can count the freckles on someone in
SWG... it's sad really, because it turns my 2+ghz machine into a slideshow
in certain areas). I never had any serious rain problems. I do have the
'frozen rain' if I shuttle or clone while raining, but rain seems to work ok
for the most part... I miss the moving storms though (At one point in beta
you could listen to the storm in the distance, it would rain on you, then
the weather would move on and you could listen to the thunder of the storm
that's passed by...)
I've not gotten a good look at the sky... I'll let you know if it looks the
same to me.
