Since most posts at this point are for EQ2, perhaps EQ1 posts should 
have EQ1: in the subject.

On the other hand, I do like your guerilla style solution to the 
problem; respond to every post that doesn't have EQ2 in the title as 
though it were about EQ1.  The sheer bulk of disinformation we could 
generate would be enormous!

Whenever someone gets snippy and points out that its obvious from the 
text which game is being discussed, you can just respond with a stock 
"default topic is EQ1, if they don't like it they can put EQ2: in the 
subject like they are supposed to."

Maybe even put it in your sig file to save time.
