Well, ok, so its a troll.

But I did enjoy the "rangers suck" discussion, even if most of it
turned around the "no they dont'" side of the arguement.

How bout them magicians?

OK, so here's a class with no CC, almost no healing, no way of
single pulling, almost no useful buffs to cast on others or their
own pets, no slow, a haste that works Only on their own pets.

They can summon a variety of items which give the critically
important focus effects... but most sensible casters have
permanent versions of those items already.  They can summon up
weapons, but the weapons they summon are hopelessly crappy for
anyone even close to their level.  Arrows?  Good for a puller
who's too cheap to bring his own, or someone training archery,
but since we only summon basic ones that don't get any better as
we level up, well, ick.  Some toys such as coldstones,
waterstones, etc, that basically duplicate buffs from other
classes or items you can buy in the bazaar. Oh and Mod Rods, the
once vastly powerful mana tool thats now a mild caffeine to the
serious spellcaster.

They are practically immune to twinking, so mudflation means
other classes get more powerful but they don't, balance continues
to slip further and further from their grasp.  This wouldn't be
true if FT items were available in anything approaching
affordability, as they could save all the cash other classes dump
into focus gear and blow it all on a few FT items; but unlike
Regen items, there really aren't affordable FT items out there,
even a lousy FT I item, the solstice earring, runs many thousands
of PP, and anything else runs ten times that or more.  Since this
is true, the only other focus item worth getting is a Improved
Healing focus, for some reason mages don't get an IH summon.

If mages had even a marginally useful CC or single pull
capability they might be soloing monsters, but as it stands they
have to work almost entirely on mobs that are easily and reliably
single pulled, very limiting.  And with no slow, gradually they
become less and less powerful anyway, as mobs at the higher end
of the game are designed with slow in mind.

Now that said, mages do seem to group reasonably well; given
someone else who can provide single targets, they have a decent
tank and DPS pet, and can dramatically increase burst DPS by a
series of reasonably good nukes; unlike a wizard, though, they
don't have to rely on that burst DPS as their only contribution
to the damage output of a group; I can happily face mob after mob
unloading only one or two nukes per kill, staying almost FM all
the time, until an overpull requires dropping adds quickly, or we
pull a high level named who needs a lot of added DPS to take
down, then I have 90% of a mana bar I can dump fairly quickly...
and we can even go right back to normal pulls right away and my
pet is still available for normal DPS production.

So far my 28 mage feels like a 28 mage from 2 years ago, in a
world where the other level 28 characters are equal to level 33
characters from the same era.. .and thats the untwinked ones who
merely have taken advantage of the Mudflation in the bazaar;
twinked out melee classes are more like level 40 characters from
the same era!

Splendid One, one level short of the next spell range blues, 28
seasoning Gnomage, Firiona (no twinking server) Vie
