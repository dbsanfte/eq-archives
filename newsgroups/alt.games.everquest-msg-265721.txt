Thing to remember is that - release may be 2 weeks after EQ2, but
open beta is supposed to start after 5-7 days of the final stress
test.  Which means, of course, that you have the choice of buying
EQ2 on Tuesday, and starting a character that you can keep working
on, or downloading 2.6 GB of WoW and playing for free for 2 weeks
on characters you may not (better not IMO) be able to keep in live.

In the meantime, there is still one huge patch coming down the
pipes (final PvP honor system/rewards, Paladin/Hunter talents,
high-level warlock pets, first raid zone open to testing (Onyxia (sp)
a dragon).

If they get that in this weekend (hoping for Saturday - I have to work
:) then that gives them 2 weeks to play-balance those changes.

In the meantime - I'm having a blast so far.  I like the graphic
style (not getting into better/worse than the competition, merely
that I think they work well), and it has the advantage of running
very smoothly on my aged machine.  Some of the quests are excellent,
others are so-so (need 2 murloc eyes for one that I've had for two
levels - it just turned yellow.  Killed 20 of them and got one eye
:(  )  The tradeskill system isn't as involved as EQ2's, but still
more fun (by far) than EQ's, and more fun than I remember DAoC's
being.  Combat with my pally has some options now, even w/o talents
and the promised pally love coming - especially against a group
of even cons or 1 +2 or +3 levels.
