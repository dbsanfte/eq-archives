Yep, I had one of those, and they are one of the leveling items, if you 
get your skills up (they are skill based, not level based like the 
Omni/Clan newcommer armor) you can push them up a ways.  But I only got 
mine up to 4 NCU, and a 9 NCU belt still only got me to 13.  I even had 
a couple other pieces that gave me another couple NCU... but 15 NCU 
still only let me use half my own nano buffs, much less accepting anyone 
else's.  Discovering I could buy an NCU unit in the subway that brought 
that up to 25 made a huge difference, since it fit in deck slot 2.  I 
need a better belt, so I can fill all five deck slots, then maybe I'd be 
able to get some real buffs running!
