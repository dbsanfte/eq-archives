   Really?  I gave up trying after the time I got a 2nd degree sunburn. 
It was so bad that my shoulders cracked and bled, and I had scars for
years.  Since then, I have learned to contain my jealousy towards those
of our kind who can produce melanin, and be at peace with my pasty,
corpse-white self.
