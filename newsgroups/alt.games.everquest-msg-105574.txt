My guild has a high level iksar sk. He's worked on his Greenmist
forever. He is stuck on the green metal shard from Chardok - the mob
is more fond of carrying its uber rare drop than the shard when he's
around. It reminds me of my trouble with black reavers.

And, I would not say your wife is half way there yet.
