Don't get me started on this.  What kind of moron 'fixes' the boat 
problem by throwing in a TPer whose favorite habit is to wander off to 
god-knows-where while a level 6 stands on the dock at Sister Island and 
has the pleasure of remembering the boat JUST leaving as she popped in 
from being TP'd from BB, knowing that the boat will now travel to BB, 
Freeport, then back before taking her BACK to BB where she started from?
