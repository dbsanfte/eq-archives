I know i'm double posting but oh well here goes...

Back many years ago when I used to play a human mage on Ayonae Ro
(This was just before Kunark).  My level 12 mage decided to hop on the
boat from Qeynos and see what was around the bend.

I passed eruds crossing, then zoned into erudin, and took a walk
through tox forrest.

I walked into what looked like the entrance to Erudin, and not paying
attention promptly fell into a HUGE hole in the ground.

Yep folks I had found Paineel, and passed right into it into THE HOLE.

Unding! You are now lvl 11 AHH SH!T!

Ok so now I've gotta go get my corpse, get on boat, run through erudin
and tox, go into other entrance.  And have a look a round.

I assumed there was just some stairs or something that I had missed so
I walked all around the BIG hole, seeing a place where it dipped down
a little, I figured it must be a switch back trail, and walked every
so carefully around the inside edge of this huge crater.

I lost my footing and fell head first into the hole yet again.

All of my money was on my corpse, as was all my kewl gear I had
accumulated in my 12 seasons bye bye
