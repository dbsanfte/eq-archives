Because most groups aren't very good at managing their distance to the 
mob.

The rogue doesn't have to 'move in' to backstab.

Using root to control aggro is an effective tactic in a competent group. 
Its not great in pickup groups, where you have little control of the 
'flexibility' of the other members to adapt to tactics. But in my 
regular groups we often use root for emergency aggro management, to let 
dps classes go all out without worrying about aggro, to let lower level 
enchanters get their pets involved, and several other tactics.
