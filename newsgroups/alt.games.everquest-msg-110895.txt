Hey Biz, a Question.

You know by now I find your posts funny as all fuck.  But one question I was
always meaning to ask ya....
What is with all the <word highlights> or <sentence highlignts> on your
posts? I <could> probably  still gather your meaning (and) decifer what
you're really trying to 'relay' to the 'reader' without all of these
<annoying> word 'highlights' implying that the word 'means' something
'other' than what the reader 'reads' or that the reader should 'read' the
emphasis and 'determine' that you're relaying 'sarcasm' or just plain old
fashioned 'self' 'imagined' 'intellectual' 'superiority'.

All those marks make you sound like an arrogant, condescending prick.

capiche?

Other then that, keep up the great work... lol

..lol..waiting for Bizbee's sidekick to show up..
