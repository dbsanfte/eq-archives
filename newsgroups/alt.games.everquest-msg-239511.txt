Most mages don't think they suck - they think they have issues
that need to be addressed.  Apparently we were pretty convincing,
considering the number of small changes for mages on test (increased
pet mitigation, a lower level version of Siphon, tweaks to TPP and
XPG and, of interest to Necros and Bst's too, pet foci now boost the
level of the pet (DPoC +1, GoDS +2, SoAS +3, GoD foci +4 etc.))
