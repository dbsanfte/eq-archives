    I wish something like this had started just about the time I quit
EQ.  I'd have joined up in heartbeat.  Now, I think it's much too late
for me.  The whole idea of going back to EQ is just so "meh" to me.  I
miss the friends I'd made, I miss you guys.  But I don't miss the game
itself at all.  I do wish you good luck with this endeavor.  I just wish
is still sounded like fun to me.
