Yes it would be a huge PITA to re-equip, but think of the
challenge.....Some of my most memorable moments have been naked corpse
runs across several zones killing mobs and re-equiping as I went :).
Sure a rusty short sword sucks at level 30+, but it wouldn't take long
to upgrade. 

You can't win EQ. It would be just one more challenge on the
never-ending road in Norrath.

Cheers
