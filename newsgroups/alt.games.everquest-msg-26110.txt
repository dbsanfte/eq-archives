I can see why people are tempted to by characters of lvl 40 or so, coz
it cuts out a lot of the tedium of the early game, if you perceive it
in that way, but you'd still have much to achieve. But a lvl 60
character? What the hell is the point? It'd be like paying someone for
a save game file for a single player rpg, saved just before
completion.
