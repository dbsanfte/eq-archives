I like that...playing my monk (yes, I do have other classes
behind my rogues...just for giggles ;-)  ) one of the worst things
about going LD while soloing is finding yourself dead.

Why doesn't the stupid server just FD and be done with it?
Heck, I FD if I just have to answer the phone or wipe my nose
or take a bite of chilli or write a novel or  mastur...
Um...did I mention that if you keep FD'ing you'll go blind?
