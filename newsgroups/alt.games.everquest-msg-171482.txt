Rogues are THE worst solo class in EQ. The fact that you cannot
"backstab" from in front of a mob should clue you in to that fact.

I highly suggest a soloing class.

Try a Beastlord. They are primarily a melee class with a really nice
line-up of spells and they can summon a pet (thier greatest strength).
It would be the perfect class for your play style and schedule.
