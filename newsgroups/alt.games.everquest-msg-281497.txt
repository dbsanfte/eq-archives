Oh come on, knock knock jokes still ammuse.  Ranger-gate jokes are no
different...

But seriously, at the onset of the group I identify the tank, let
everyone know that he's the priority no matter what, and that the only
way the group survives is if, in order, the tank/cleric/slower
survive.  There are exceptions of course but generally that's the
lowdown.

Usually I HoT the puller as he goes, after that it's a real gamble on
his part if he gets healed again.  Twice in MPG I had to let the
puller die just to keep the tank up until slow landed.  The way it
goes sometimes.

If there's a patch healer in the group though the rules change.
