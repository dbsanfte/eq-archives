need some advice guys-i have a 43 dwf clr-i have been wearing  the
-bloodstained tunic, ac13, +4 wis&agi, wt 6.5- my wis ends up being
192, with about 40 more in mana from other stuff- I just recently got
a Ry'gorr Battle mail ( fun fight)-AC18, +10 str, 20 mana, +5 poisen,
wt 1.0-my delema is that while the ry'gorr has better 'other stats',
as a cleric-i need the highest mana pool possible---at my level,
whats better 4 wis or 20 mana, and as i advance?-i know there is some
sort of formula, but i dont really know it-any advice
appreciated-wearing the ry'gor now, but fearing i'm taking a hit on
mana pool-thanks in advance :) Ironeyes-43 season clr, Rathe,
