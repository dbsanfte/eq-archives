As opposed to now where it has the 2nd highest pre-51 xp cost?  
It is still a HUGE jump in from 50 to 51, and making 50 20% harder
than it is now isn't going to do much to alleviate the pain.

I got to low 40s with hybrid xp penalty, and didn't mind the penalty
as much as the way that hybrids were shunned from groups because of
how they at exp.  Hmmm, would you rather have a troll SK or a halfling
warrior as your tank.  Especially when when takes twice the exp of the
other.

Early CR was certainly exciting.  Of course starting in Kelethin makes
it even more so, with a sense heading skill of 1, no idea that the
rocket scientists at Verant have the x-asis swapped, and the ever
present danger of falling off the lifts.  Remember when the lifts were
bugged and you could lag a bit and fall to your death?
