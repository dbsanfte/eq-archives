 Correct. So you still get the benefit of greater enchanter haste plus
the atk/ac effect of your epic. This would not be the case if the monk
epic was spell based. Which is really what I was trying to clarify in my
top post. So I'm not really sure what you meant by "For purposes of
stacking, it works the same way" since it technically doesn't.

 Anyway, I'd rather have it how it was a few patches ago where it
stacked with ATK buffs and not haste spells.
