}There are three types of haste: Item haste, Spell haste, and *Song haste.
}*song haste is a special category, most haste songs fall in the "spell haste"
}category,
}and do not stack with chanter/shaman hastes.
}Item haste+Spell haste has a cap.
}Song haste does not apply towards that cap, nor is it limited by the cap.

Song haste has been suggested to 'amplify' other haste, so rahter than 
adding a set percentage, it takes however much haste you already have and 
multiplies it by 1.05, say.  I haven't seen definitive parses either way, 
and lucy only lists percentages.  Otherwise, good summary, Lance.

}Items which proc haste are not proccing "item haste" they are proccing either
}"spell haste" or "song haste".
}I'm not certain what happens with "whistling fists" but I'm willing to 
}bet it is "song haste" (ie same line as Melody of E. and Battlecry of Vah 
}Shir etc.). This would mean it would stack with chanter/shaman/beastlord 
}hastes, and with normal bard haste.

Nope.  RotWF procs Jonthan's Whistling Warsong, a Bard song that is spell 
haste.  It has non-haste components, though, so it is frequently seen to 
stack, ie, you have JWW and Alacrity up at the same time, but only get the 
haste from Alacrity.  The haste components do -not- stack.

}I don't know anything about slow stacking.

Yeah, me either.  Maybe once my Haste and Focus Items pages are all caught 
up from PoP I'll tackle that next. :)
