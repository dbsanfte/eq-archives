Oh, I don't know...I played a warrior as my main for awhile and it was a lot
more work than any other class I've played so far.  It's not the fighting
part that's a challenge, it's that people expect you to do the pulling.  So
while most people get to glance around at health bars and target/cast on
mobs now and then (or sitting while I bring something), I find myself always
glued to my screen staring hard, running around, then luring stuff back,
fighting, leaving to get more, ad nauseum.  It's not rocket science, but
it's a LOT more work than any other class I've played...very tedious.
