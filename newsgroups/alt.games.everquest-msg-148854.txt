Agreed with everything you said Codeguru,

Maybe Sony could just email the Account owner of an impending
character wipe. At least that warns the Character Deletion before it
happens, so they could reactivate if they wanted too.

What is disturbing is that people who bashed me don't see the possible
future trend of all this.  Sims Online, StarWars, DAOC, AC2, EQ,
Shadowbane, EQ2 etc...

A lot of games coming out that I will enjoy- but can only
realistically pay for one account consistently to maintain character
state.  Leaves little room to enjoy the others "long term".  A tough
choice to make especially when you get turned off from a game due to a
Character Nerf, or Bugs introduced, or just wanting to take a break
etc...

Bah- I'm done complaining...thanks to everyone who read this thread
and replied constructively.  To the folk who bashed me...that's cool
too- if it adds to your enjoyment of Life...more power to ya!

:)
