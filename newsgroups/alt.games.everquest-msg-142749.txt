*giggle* I'm obsessed over Legolas.  Well, I *was* until I saw him in 
real life and wept over the goofy clothing and the hair cut from hell.  
Fashion sense needs to slap that boy around a bit.  But I didn't cuss 
out any poor slob killing guards in the commons (although I do RP some 
rather nasty glares at anyone killing my Nek/Neriak guards ::eyes a 
certain white bear::)

In fact, a friend and I--err I mean, some weird chicks I know wrote a 
short fic based on the stupid clothing he wears.  Not Legolas-fic as 
much as Orlando-fic.  I don't really go *looking* for slash-fic.  It 
usually finds me through other people sending it, and, well, the Orlando 
one we wrote just got silly :D
