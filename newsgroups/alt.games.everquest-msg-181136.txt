I miss seeing Sergent Slate attacking the evil races in the tunnel.  I
would get offended seeing trolls & ogre's mingling with the good
people of Norrath, like the Wood Elves and Humans.  I used to notify
Sergent Slate of what was going on at the East Commonland tunnel and
he would follow me to validate my claims.  How I miss hearing his
battle cry, "that's it swine, you're outta here!"

Those were the days.  It's better with the bazaar, even though the
people in Shadowhaven are more tolerant than the fine people of East
Commonlands.
