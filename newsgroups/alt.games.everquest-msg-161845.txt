    I don't expect other people to eat a death and waste their time just to
avoid the possibility of training me. I do expect them to avoid mowing me
down on purpose, though. That means not detouring from the most direct route
to zone-out to drag mobs through my camp. That means if I'm in your way on
that direct route, either detour around me, kite in a circle while /telling
me "move dumbass", or /shout "TRAIN TO ZONE".

> I truly wish PoP mobs summoned.

    The indoors ones do. ;-) There's XP zones that are quite nice because of
that, too.

    Were you on the landing of the castle, heading out to the glasslands?
All trains, even if the person jumps off the cliff at the side, path through
the castle and will path back through it afterwards. I used to set up groups
on the far side, by the lever to get into Aerin'Dar's chamber, for just that
reason.

    Again, stuff coming back from a train will path through the castle. I
consider the area a place to run through, not a place to set up shop.

    God, people must hate you. If you're talking the corner where the two
planarians spawn, on the same river as the razor caves, that's deliberate.

    If people always came to the graveyard from the same direction, opposite
where the zone-in was, this wouldn't be a problem. Sadly, people don't think
ahead. =/

    LOL, did you /bye to them? If the mobs aren't native KOS you can always
Atone with the cleric, and say "I saved you!" Of course as soon as you Atone
they start to regen like mad, making it impossible for the moron to get the
kill. THEN they stay away from you.

    In my case it's the members of other "top guilds" that are acting like
morons. One other guild just killed Grummus for their CoD flag - I'm really
not looking forward to having them in my new favourite XP spot. Especially
since I hear the horror stories from HoH (I'm not HoH flagged, but part of
the guild and most of the other guild is). Time to push onwards to the next
XP zone!
