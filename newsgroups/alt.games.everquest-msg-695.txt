Okay, I've done some reading (apparently, not enough) and still can't
quite get a handle on this critical hit thing.

I was just wondering.  I've got a level 6 Ranger that I started and was
just curious if I'll ever see crits.  I think I'll see them some day from
my bow, I hope.

I think remember seeing that Wizzies get crits on some spells too, right?

Anyway, who gets crits and on what?  Is it based off of a melee skill
or level?
