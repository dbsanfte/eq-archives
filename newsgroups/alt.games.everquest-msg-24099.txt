Wuoshi has a huge aggressive range from what I've heard.  All the way from the
WL circle most of the way out of that little valley.   I don't think the KDS
does.   But thats negated by the fact that if you get them, they spawn *right
freaking on top of you*.

Wuoshi is a she.   And I don't think she gets trained.   Unless it was a
failed raid, I don't think anybody would live long enough to make the zone
line. ; )

*nod*  Depends where he's going, he wasn't too specific I don't think.   If
he's going to the tunare tower, mostly west.   If he's going to Skyshrine, I
prefer to go northwest and follow the wall, so as not to miss it.
