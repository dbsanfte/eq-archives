That's all well and good for people with level 65+ characters and
level 50+ alts.  But if you're trying to do a quest with your main
while the quest is still anywhere near level-appropriate (so that
the reward will be only somewhat disappointing instead of totally
useless :-), you're not likely to have an alt tough enough to check
some of these camps.

And since we're talking about a monk quest, binding nearby doesn't
do a lot except make CRs more exciting!

My monk 42 is also trying to get the Robe of the Lost Circle; it
would still actually be an upgrade for me.  I have all the sashes
and headbands and now need the parts that require interminable camps.
I can probably get a group together that would let me clear to the
camps and take out the named, but I doubt I can convince a group to
sit there for hours with me.  I guess I can bind an alt nearby, use
invis to check for the named (and hope invis doesn't drop at awkward
times like it usually does), and if I spot it then hope I can pull
together a group and get there before it despawns.  I've been putting
it off a while since the concept isn't real appealing, but I guess I
should just start trying for it and see if I'm one of the lucky ones
or if I get to join the ranks of the EverCampers.
