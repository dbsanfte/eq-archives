You know it's funny.  But the piece of siht in charge of that board
*already* "sold" it to the community for two and a half grand last year.
Of course he reneged on his promise to hand over control and now he's
sold it again.

It's quite funny over there at the moment.  Threads and posts being
deleted constnantly, posters banned, it just goes to show what a fucking
stupid idea moderated web boards are compared to the pure, uncensored
and free nature of Usenet.
