I recently turned off luclin models, and have become reaquainted with the
joy that is Velious graphics.  I discovered that
worked/reinforced/heavy/etc. dragon armor, while tinted blue-green, has a
unique velious graphic I have never seen before.  It isn't ry'gorr,
ulthork, crystal chitin, or netted kelp base graphic...it is a chain-like
look that I've never seen before.

Does anyone know what velious armor has this graphic but untinted?  I'm
fairly sure that all SS/Kael/Thurg quest armors are based on
ry'gorr/ulthork/CC graphics, so I'm fairly sure it ain't those.

Thanks a bunch in advance.
