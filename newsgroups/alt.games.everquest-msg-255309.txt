Can't say I've ever actually seen a chest spawn spiders. Traps do, but
in all the time my rogue opened chests, and failed occasionally, I never
saw spiders from a chest. Traps on the other hand, I saw set off by
accidental ae's, even a area stun from an enchanter will set a trap off,
and the ones that can spawn spiders (mistmoore? been ages since I did an
ldon) has a 1 in 4 chance from what I remember in beta.

A trick I used on my rogue that really seemed to help was never inspect
a chest, go straight to disarm trap. It will tell you if it's trapped
when you try to disarm it and with maxed disarm the chance of failure is
very minimal.

After a while I stopped bothering anyway. Dispite the tales of decent
drops from chests I never saw one and no one in my guild ever did
either.
