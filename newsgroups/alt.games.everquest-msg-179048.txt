Fascinating.  You are claiming that were there observing when I
encountered these assholes?  There's definitely the smell of
bullshit here, but I think you're looking in the wrong place for
the source.

Most Druids I've seen there will at least kill the easy PHs (lizardmen).
I have never seen a Bard kill a PH there, not one.  I've never seen an
Enchanter solo there, so no data.

Nah, not jealous, just venting an old annoyance.  At least for the time
I was there all the Bards were assholes, while other classes just had
the usual mix of behavior (except that I only ran into one asshole
Necro, which seemed odd, and zero asshole Mages, but then I've yet to
encounter an asshole of a Mage).
