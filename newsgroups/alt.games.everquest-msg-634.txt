Hehe... welcome to the Commons ! A lvl 19 wizzy took me there to show
me around when I was lvl 4... I ended dying so much that I would just
let my corpse rot ! Not a fun place at your level, but in a while,
you'll call it home !

You must be talking about the tunnel that connects East Commons and
North Ro. This is just a convenient way to go from one to another. And
a nice meeting place in the middle, with a few vendors.
