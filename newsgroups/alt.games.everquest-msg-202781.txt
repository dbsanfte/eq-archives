I think it's ridiculous to lay all the blame on the players for all
this. Was it not Sony's fault for letting the problem persist for so
long that it created a culture of people who simply required it as
play? If it was NOT an intended feature, why did they not fix it
earlier, when the backlash would have been minimal at most?

Just something to think about.
