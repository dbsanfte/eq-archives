It might be that A hates B.  I know there's a few people I'll never group
with in a dungeon again.  One of them, because he's scum.  A certain Paladin
because he's an idiot.  A particular Beastmaster because she's a thief.  And
a Cleric who I know to be a nitwit.  If that Cleric was available, I still
wouldn't take her.

I know the feeling.  I'm currently working in Everfrost.  I go in, I put up
LFG, I announce once over /ooc that a 46 Necro's looking for a group, and
then I go and start making life miserable for the ice giants.  So far, so
good.

I then watch out of curiosity as the various shouts and oocs are announced.
I will see people calling for "members for such-and-so" who are looking for
my level range.  I don't respond.  Why?  Because if they're too stupid to
check the LFGs, then they're too dangerous to work with.  (Personal opinion,
obviously.)

Does it cost me anything?  Yes, it costs me possibly-acquired dungeon
points.  On the other hand, 3 hours on the ice giants last night got me from
36% to 75% and over 800 Plat.

Over the weekend in BB I got annoyed at the groups grabbing only "the best"
that I responded to one group, grabbed an Enchanter who was sitting also
LFG, and convinced them to go in with our sub-optimal 5-man group
immediately.  We killed that dungeon, then lost our Warrior, gained a
Paladin and Ranger, and killed another dungeon, both in about 4 hours.  (2
dungeons, and we got one lousy set of gloves; not a single Augment.)

Got a comment at the end of it from the Enchanter.  He said that it was the
most fun he'd had with his character in a long time.
