Howling Stones is a bring your own group zone. Very good exp for early to
mid 50's and a fun dungeon to play in. On zone in there are two wanderers,
either skeles, bile golems or toothy sperm things. From there are 4 locked
doors that a rogue can pick to go into the wings or you can drop off to the
basement and kill there.
