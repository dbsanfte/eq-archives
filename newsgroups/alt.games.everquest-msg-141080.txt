}And on a side side note, he did ask if there was any reason to keep his

Probably.  Yes, definitely.  But you should have told him also that he can 
Slam instead of Bash, and hence doesn't ever never really need a shield.

}Oh, and I just about killed him when he went and bought some BP he 
}wanted that had 20AC and -4agi for 200pp when he could have had a 
}something chitin for 20AC with *no* negative stats for 50pp if he'd done 
}a simple search.  I'm fairly certain it was a woman playing the warrior

Woman player?  That sounds like stereotypical male clothes shopping:  Walk 
into store looking for a shirt, find the big pile of shirts, grab one that 
says it's the right size (if you're lucky, he'll doublecheck to make sure 
it isn't paisley) take it up to the counter, pay, and leave.  Elapsed 
time: 2.7 minutes.

I get looks of wonderment from women I shop with when I actually head for 
the dressing room without prodding.
