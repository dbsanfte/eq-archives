You may find it hard to believe, but it's true. I don't remember the actual
numbers or the name of the quoted reference, but I read a report a few
months ago that said in 1999 (the most recent year they had numbers for)
more children under 5 years of age were killed by drowning in 5 gallon
buckets than by the accidental discharge of firearms. The occasional
accidental shooting makes for splashy news, and fits the mindset of the
reporters (guns are evil!) so they are much more widely reported. In spite
of that, I can't remember reading a single report of an accidental gunshot
death in my area of Southern California in the 8 years I have lived here,
but there have been several drownings in swimming pools.
