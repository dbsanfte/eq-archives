To quote from our Charter:

"Regia Antiquus is an EverQuest guild on the Erollisi Marr server aimed at
providing a home for European based players, arranging raids and events at
reasonable European times.

Regia Antiquus is primarily a guild for players whose main character is
above level 40.
We also aim to also offer a home to lower level European players, and
therefore we will entertain membership applications from mature recruits as
low as level 20, whom we feel will grow into the Guild as effective and
valuable members."
