Hmm about 3 days ago on my server when I logged on I noticed I was running
everywhere at SoE speed. Sorta weird for a gnome rogue. But then I noticed
everyone else was running at the same speed too, and the mobs were running
faster?? I thought it was just some error with the client/server
communication and would get back in synch but I noticed that I was getting
from point a to point b alot faster than normal.
