I would be amazed too if they did that.  But they didn't,
so I'm not.   They made *group* mobs melee better
because they were trivial to level-appropriate *groups.*
If a *solo* player can reliably kill *group* mobs,
that means they're EASY for *groups.*

If you want to solo, solo *solo* mobs.  Duh.  There's
plenty out there.   They do have the same loot tables,
it'll just take more kills.   Which is appropriate -- after
all, there's six people looking for loot in a group
supposedly.  More *solo* quests will be added
with the big patch -- 30 or 40 or so from what I've
seen.
