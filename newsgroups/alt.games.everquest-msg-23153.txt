Where, for a lvl 16 Shadow Knight, wanting to solo without dying 2 or
3 times per night, and having to race every other player to a mob, are
these areas?

I understand that there is limited space in the world, and with 2200
people logged on a server at many times, there will be some conjested
areas.  I try to hunt in the Oasis, but every time i try to go after a
croc that is blue/white, some other person attacks it.  I got a
warning placed on me by a GM last year for KSing something and quit,
so I don't want to do it again, so I basically just stand around
looking ugly and scaring small children.

Thank you for any information.
