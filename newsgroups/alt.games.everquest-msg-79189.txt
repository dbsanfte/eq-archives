Actually its probably more of a safety feature in a way for
circumstances like this (that high ledge walk in katta.) What would
happen if Player B who was graphically lagged kept up with Player A
who was not? I'll tell you what would happen, player b would die, a
lot. The problem in EQ would be, as with this circumstance or as I
mentioned being graphically lagged and passed up by people in my group
with MY sow in Eastern Wastes, that to the graphically lagged person
they would NOT be at the danger point yet while if the server
ESTIMATED where they'd be (as in FPS games) they WOULD be and they'd
die not knowing it. Examples would not just be running off the ledge
in katta when to the graphically lagged person it appeared that they
were a ways away from it, but running into a monster or something.

FPS games estimate player location so a person with a worse connection
is not crippled. Usually its right in the better ones but it can cause
warping to both parties. The difference is that in such FPS games over
a modem usually the danger is not falling or running into a monster
but is instead other players shooting you which would be more likely
to happen if you kept getting lagged and slowing/stopping. In EQ,
however, placement estimations by the server would be downright
dangerous and would lead to death in many circumstances. What happens
in EQ when you die in such circumstances? You petition a gm and it
becomes a customer service nightmare for you AND for verant. So its
not really "poor" coding.
