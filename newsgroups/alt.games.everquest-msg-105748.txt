Ok... I gotta know... Vaslin is that you?

my impression was the cap on how much you can gain is a hard cap period... 
ie, on a kill you might get 2% of a level, but with zone bonus of say 35% 
you'd get 2.7%... whereas if you got 9% base, with a 35% bonus, you'd 
still only get 11% (not the 12.15% the bonus would seem to entitle you 
to).
