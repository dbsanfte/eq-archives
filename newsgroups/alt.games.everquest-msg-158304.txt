It's one of those things that are hard to explain... Haste increases the
amount of swings per minute. So with a weapon with a moderate proc-rate, as
you swing faster you increase the amount of attacks - which means chances to
proc.

If you have a weapon that swings 10 times per minute, your chances of
procing per minute are higher than with a weapon that swings 5 times per
minute.

More attacks = more chances to proc.

The only thing I can think of the skew the results is that Instrument of
Nife is a buff that randomly procs (like a SK's Vampiric Embrace/Shroud of
Death). So the buff may take weapon delay into consideration.

Just imagine the damage of Instrument of Nife with a Mosscovered Twig...
(well, if it fit in the primary slot - damn nerf)
