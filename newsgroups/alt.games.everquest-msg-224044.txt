Man that really sucks so easy to fix yet no one willing to help. Thank
those who mantain stopping any form of "cheating" is more important
than the time and effort of honest players. EQ is full of this kind of
thing then we hear of sharks dropping fortunes to a "lucky" few who
cause honest vendors to lose plat and items to correct while many of
the looters simply sat on the plat till the issue died down, talk
about inconsistant. Justice can never be a seperate issue from honesty
and SoE has always been very heavy handed with players. But they will
never get another dime of my money and if you are still paying them
shame on you.
