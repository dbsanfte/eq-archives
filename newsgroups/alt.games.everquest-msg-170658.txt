Their support has been going down hill for the last two years, it's still
better than most in the industry.

Not bad. I'd go with a little more memory, more hard drive space, and
windows 2k, but I like doing many many things(and will shortly be able to
have 15 programs open at once playing eq), am a data packrat, and dislike
XP.
Good on web places to get a pre built 'gaming class' machine:
Falcon Northwest http://www.falcon-nw.com/
Alienware http://www.alienware.com
Both will run you a premium price, but they are generally premium machines.
I've worked on an Alienware Area 51 (the guy wanted us to replace his hard
drives with 2 larger ones, and upgrade his video card to the latest and
greatest.) and it was vary well done. All the cables were tied down, tucked
neatly out of the way of air flow, the cards were spaced as optimally as
they could get, it was very good.
