War Ensemble
Find this song on Sheet music, CD
(Music: Hanneman / Lyrics: Araya & Hanneman)
Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the siege
The pendulum it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid

Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The number[s] that are dead

(Chorus:)
Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's a massacre [sings "really massacre" 1st time,
"really survival" 2nd]
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Solo: Hanneman

(Chorus)

Be dead fiend from above
When darkness falls
Descend onto my sights
Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground
Regime prophetic age
Old in its time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine
Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
(era forever more... war)

Solo: King

Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining by the night
In blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat

Sport the war, war support
The sport is [war,] total war
When victory's a massacre [doesn't sing this]
When victory is survival [or this!]
When this end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
