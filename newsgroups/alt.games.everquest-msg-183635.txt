I don't know if my rogue counts as "extreme powerleveling", he is level 54,
4 days /played, max ally to CoV

Stats:
Defence is maxed
1hs/piercing is maxed
BS is 206
Offence is maxed
Riposte is maxed
Dodge (or is that parry.. whatever) is maxed
Sense heading is maxed
Swimming is maxed

Where he lacks somewhat -
Pickpocket - 169
Sense trap - 79
Disarm - 49
Sneak - 140
Hide - 140
ID - 0
Disarm - 0
Poison - 0

How does that compare to a non-pleveled rogue?  Well.. I'm pretty certain my
rogues defensive skills are much higher than a non-PL rogue.  What kind of
group is going to let a rogue keep getting agro to be hit/raise defence?

BS isn't maxed, but its close enough, and by the time I hit 60 will be maxed
without doubt, i wouldnt be surprised if I hit the cap at 55

Sneak and Hide are lagging behind, my lazyness.. hasn't made a difference
yet and both easy to raise

ID.. Disarm.. I worked these upto max on my monk, I know how useless they
are.

My motives...  I have a rogue, who with very minimul work, is now in the
level range that I enjoy.. the levels where I do "real" damage (ohhh big
number!), more importantly, at the level range that all my friends are...  I
can group with my monk friends (my real friends)

My second wizzie was PL'd, hes level 4...x (46? shrug) and has maxed
defence.   Jazz - what is you're level 60 Wizzies defence?   I know my
non-PL'd magicians defence is pathetic.. of course it is - if he got hit in
groups he was a) a massive mana drain   b) dead

What have I missed out on by PLing?   Other than being in retard zones such
as Ill omen, karners etc?
