Thought I would get everyones opinion on something that crossed my mind
today. Whenever I am in the East Commonlands there are lots of people who
are asking for price checks on items. I am one of the lucky people who have
two computers and can look up prices. I basically have a few questions:

1. Would it be wrong/unethical to offer a service where I will price check
items for people? Say .. 1PP per price check?

2. Give or take .. how accurate is www.eqprices.com ?

3. Would you use such a service?

Maybe something like this has no place in EQ but I thought I would throw it
out there and see what people say.
