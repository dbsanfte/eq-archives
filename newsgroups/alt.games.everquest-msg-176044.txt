I thought it looked wierd too at first, but theres actually a reason 
behind the wierd prices like that.
I could take myself as example. One of our guild chanters need KEI, and 
borrow 30K from me to buy it. Shell have to pay it back when she get the 
money, but since were not playing on same time zone, it can be hard to 
find each other online.
So instead of spending a few weeks looking for each other, i just set a 
fishing grub for sale in bazaar for 30K. Then when she get the money, 
she goes and buy that fishing grub, and everyone is happy again.
