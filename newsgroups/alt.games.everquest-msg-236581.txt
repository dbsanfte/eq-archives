As long as the pet class knows how to control the pet, then banning
them from using them will only be hurting yourselves. If the BSTs were
high level and didn't have pet discipline yet, tell them to get their
asses out and grind AAXP until they have it before doing any serious
raiding. >< Even without it, use that damn /pet back off hotkey if the
pet starts running after something before you're ready. But, if the
pets aggroed, that means either it or the master got attacked. It
won't pull aggro itself if it's not attacking anything...
