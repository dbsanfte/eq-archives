    You have DSL? Ok, look in the Datarate.txt file in your EQ directory.
This number controls how much data you can receive, and if set incorrectly
can cause exactly the sort of problem you listed. My first experience with
datarate.txt being set wrong was also an AoW raid. ;-) It should be set to
9.0 for a cable modem, so I'm guessing it should also be 9.0 for DSL
(someone like Ben Wilson will know this for certain, I'm guessing). Why
Verant doesn't have anything in the manual about this, one of the most
important things to change once you make the transition to the raiding game,
is beyond me.
