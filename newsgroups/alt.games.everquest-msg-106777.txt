Guessing you are looking for Items to sell instead of major coinage. Inside
Sol A easy stuff to kill and most all drop fine steel weapons and vendors to
sell to I have done as much as 400p an hour no exp though.

Little tougher mobs and good coin drops is HGs in Rathe Mts but you will be
running to the gem merchant constantly. (My Monk buys gems to cut weight)

Geoids in Waking Lands is another good spot for gems
