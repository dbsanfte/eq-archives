Another thing i am thinking now is that i has something to do with
people in the zone?  I was just in there now, and was getting the nice
4-5pp loot.  There were only like 6 other people in there.  The other
night when there wasnt crap for loot, and it was a friday night, with
20+ people in the zone.  just another observation.

noticed while pullin trogs for me and my SK partner to bash on, the
king was up.  On his own, he doesnt hit much harder than the other
trogs.  But he had a good strong core of about 3 other trogs around
him, and we managed to kil em so it was just him and another.  after
one failed attempt in which we both died, we took him down.  He
dropped the shaman / beastlord legs, and that was it.  

I also saw in there a flint hammer rottin away, so i looted it.  Any
idea if there is a market for these?  no one arond the nexus will buy
flint weapons or the netherbian chitin from my experience, but if i
take this stuff down to norrath think i woudl have better luck?
