I am sure I read somewhere that Sony had relaxed the rules on transferring
characters from accounts that you didn't originally own, but reading the
terms just now it seems that the condition still applies. Can anyone
confirm? A friend of mine has been given an account by a buddy who has
retired from game, and although he cannot afford to pay two accounts he
would like to keep one of the chars from it ....
