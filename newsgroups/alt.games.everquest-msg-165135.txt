I cannot be arsed reading back but good luck finding any dark blue at
62 mobs to bowkite anywhere outside PoP.  Western Wastes perhaps but I
guarantee most AM3/EQ Rangers have trashed CoV faction so again, good

If you seriously think that all xp mobs have the same amount of HPs
you're more of a lost cause than I took you for originally.
