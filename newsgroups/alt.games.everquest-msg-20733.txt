Ooh, good idea.  That fits with something I've long wanted in the
game, a way to tag certain players with "notes", which would
pop up when you encounter those PC's again.

[The game says]:  "Hark, yonder approaches the adventurer
                  dubbed by thee, 'the most incompetent Cleric
                  I've ever seen'"
