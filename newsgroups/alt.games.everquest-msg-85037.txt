They are going about this teh wrong way.  They should make the
websites and their costs a separate add on for EQ players.  I would
pay a small fee, say $3 a month to have a character site and another
bunch for a guild site.  This is a good idea but not making me move to
other servers to do it.  I could see them doing a whole bunch of
services that would be tailored for the EQ community and only charge a
nominal fee.  They could take all the services offered by PHP-Nuke,
EZboard, Maglo, EQatlas and put them all together or as a separate
service.  Perhaps hire some artists to do character portraits.  I see
a whole bunch of different services...
