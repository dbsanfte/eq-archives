Those aren't progress markers, they are loot.  A progress marker
would be an item you can wield, but that you will later hand in
as part of the ongoing quest.

Further, the items you are thinking of as progress markers aren't
reliable anyway, since they are random drop off a loot table; you
can't say "he doesn't have Infuse, he can't be far along yet" since
Infuse may never drop.

Lastly, I have the blazing boots, helmet, and breastplate off
Ragefire, and hope to collect the whole set.  Course thats not
from MY ragefire kill, but I'm happy to keep helping out... and
I'm seriously considering getting another shimmering pearl so
we can farm RF for his drops.
