From the shadows, the mysterious jaZZmanian Devil <jshaw@stny.rr.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Just for the record, went back this afternoon, and the revenant
(actually two of them wandering) was still there. One revenant didn't
come close enough to aggro, but the other one wandered RIGHT to the
water's edge. My guess is this is a new spawn meant to discourage
entrance campers, not a bug.

I couldn't solo it. :/ It was blasting for over 500 and that's just
too much moxy for Lori to handle.

That eliminates the Hole from my list of potential spots. At least,
for a good long while it does. And Jaggedpine's framerate is just too
damn annoying, so I can't go there either.

If I am stuck in highkeep I'm going to go batshit. :-p
