Humm!

I haven't been able to play in a while. All short characters and old 
computer. Hehe! worst all the combinations for bugs

So I have only been logging in after patches to see if there has been 
any improvement for the last couple of months.

So far PoK on Bristlebane has gone from an average 220+  in zone. The 
highest I ever saw was 287 that was all before  the opening of PoK to 
everyone!

Now I have seen the lowest at 85 and an average of about 150.

This could be related to the PoK crash problem though.

But is still not a good sign
Yours
