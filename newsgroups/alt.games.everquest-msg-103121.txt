At least one officer that I know of was there.

I think one person claims the guild leader was there on another character.

Several people have already deguilded themselves from OOR, exactly as they
said they would if it was ever done.

I'm not going to speculate about what's going to happen to OOR or the 
people who did it.  I'm curious to see what becomes of it though.

I believe every believes the good faith in general by Members of OOR that 
it was not the guild's decision to wake the SLeeper, but that a rogue few 
went and stealth killed Nanz.
