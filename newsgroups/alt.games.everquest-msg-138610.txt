Well, on the one hand, I sympathize with the list people.  Its not
GM mandated, but the EQ community has never been one to
abide by PNP, the lamest camp control policy out there.  Its
up to each server to decide how they want to run camps like
Ragefire, and a list is one way that gets done.  Question is,
does your server actually agree to the list?  GMs are not ever
going to support it.

Given that the list -isn't- really how your server is handling Rage,
and particularly given the grief they were giving you, unsolicited,
regarding the obvious impossibility of it being GM mandated
(thats a Ledgends thing) I can certainly see deciding to bust it.

There is no real need to have a cleric with a pearl ready to
do this.  The cleric epic is blindingly easy to get, the first three
steps can be soloed, the third takes a couple people (maybe
soloable but probably not soloable by a cleric) and the next
one would be doable by a group or two, the Chardok one
a small raid that kills king and queen repeatedly for some
nice drops and oh, by the way epic piece for any clerics and
(is it warriors) attending.

Then there is Ragefire, -also- doable single group, but he's
slow to pop and so there's a backlog of 50 plus clerics who
all want him.  On any server, the method for dealing with
this problem sucks.  Lists suck.  FFA sucks.  Heck, if it
was me, I'd say all clerics in the zone with their pearl come
fight each time he pops, and we random for it.  People
tend to hate random, though, oh well.

At any rate, my point is, given you have at least 11 high level
friends interested in having a cleric they know with his
clicky stick, you could -start- with the ragefire drop, and
do the rest in a week, much better than the NINE MONTHS
I expect  to wait for my water sprinkler.
