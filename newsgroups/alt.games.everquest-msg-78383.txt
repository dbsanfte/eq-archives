pretty uncommon in High Keep I think.   but if you have the money that is a
good place to buy it, as there seems to always be a group in there.

When I was doing the XP grind there, a Dwarf would drop in the same time
every night and auction to buy ore at twice the merchent price.  pretty soon
everyone was hording whatever ore they could until he came in.
