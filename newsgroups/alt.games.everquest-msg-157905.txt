Where did you get the foolish notion that the rules of chess have never 
changed?  Just compare it with its Chinese cousin, Shiang-chi, and you'll see 
that it has evolved rather a lot since its inception.

And there's plenty of variants still popular today.  Generally referred to as 
'faerie chess' by purists.  But someday, the original will be the off-brand, 
and it will have changed again.
