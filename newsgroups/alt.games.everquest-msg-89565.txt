Keep in mind that for combat skills, it is 5*LVL+5, so at lvl11, your max
skill will be 60.
To help you raise your skill more quickly, you want weapons with lower
delay. The faster
you can hit, the more chances you have to raise your skill. Sure you prob
won't do as much
damage, but if you are looking to raise skill, you want to strike more
times.
