my lvl 70 BL pet normally hits for 99's ... with minion of eternity, it hits 
for 102 ... but it DOES regen a whopping bit more

even so,

i would expect you to have equal or better results if you use a focus item


so....getting one ....

i'm going to read into your post a whole lot because i know you're on FV - 
it's really hard to find a focus item for sale that isn't frighteningly 
overpriced, but we do make out better than other servers ... the cheapest 
thing, which doesn't work if you're soloing, is to just borrow someone's 
while you summon your pet ... i know that sounds crazy, but really, you 
could borrow a focus item from anyone who will loan it to you (got 
collateral? got friends? this part isn't meant to be the hurdle) and summon 
pet, then so long as pet doesn't die, you're good to go for a while

i realize how insane that sounds, don't worry =)

bit of a sidebar: some advice for you that no one gave me = minion of 
darkness is NOTHING ... it does not work ... it looks perfect but it doesn't 
exist...also, when a focus effect does focus your pet, there is *no* emote 
to let you know...you'll have to watch the damage to be sure (it's really 
weird, taking something from sony on faith)

anyway....

on FV you can buy a MoE focus item (pyrique's belt, for example) for maybe 
30k ... that ranges up to over 100k for some fancy gear that you'll use all 
the time and not swap out (i would imagine the mage boards have a thread 
like the one on beastlords.org =  http://tinyurl.com/ln7nn )

and the diamond prism of companionship, the single jewel of LDoN (for pet 
classes...priests have their own and everyone else gets the shaft!), is also 
for sale, but it's usually priced ridiculously around 40k


see you in game ^_^
