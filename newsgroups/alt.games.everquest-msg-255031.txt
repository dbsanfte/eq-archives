Sorry, you're incorrect.  Understandable, since you don't seem to have

It's not your decision either to tell us not to open our chests.  It's our
indivudal groups decision.    On that run we decided to open them.  There
was little to no danger of someone actually dying from it, and zero chance
we would lose the adventure, even if someone did.
