So. Wizard port then?  I am honestly, seriously not sure I'm getting 
this right.  If 'ranger gate' just means finding a wizard to gate you, 
then I don't understand how it became 'ranger gate' instead of, oh, 
'rogue gate' or whatever.  If it's something else, then no, I don't get 
it.

No.  What is a cleric COTH?  I know what COTH is, but it's a mage spell.  
So no, I don't know where the cleric comes in.

1) Guild is virtually dead, and most of em are around my level.
2) VERY rarely bother with newsgroup when I'm EQing, or vice versa.
3) I've found /oocing any question ends up in six different answers, and 
one idiot /shouting "what, you don't know? har har, n00b".

The one thing I can think of that you MAY be talking about is what I've 
always heard of as a 'warrior's port'- strip and put stuff in bank, die 
by guard, be ported to bind.  Cleric COTH would, of course, be a rez.  
IF that's what you're talking about, then yes, I get it.  If not, then 
no, I'm sorry, I still don't.

I'm sorry I asked for a clarification about EQ in an EQ newsgroup, 
though.
