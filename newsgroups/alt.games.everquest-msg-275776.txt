Why not? The crafted gear is also attunable. The reasoning is that by using
it you're wearing it off. Other schemes could have been applied to simulate
this, but there's no good reason why you should both have the benefit of
using an item until you outgrow it and then get a good price for it on the
market.

Everything crafted and quested must eventually disappear from the game.
Otherwise, quest rewards and crafted items become worthless at some point,
which is bad for crafters and adventurers alike.

Probably, but I don't think you would like those either because what's
annoying you seems to be that they've taken away the privilege of using
items at no cost. And they just had to do that. It's so obvious that one
wonders why they didn't figure that out from the beginning.

>New fuel?? Why?

They wanted to still make it an advantage for classes to work together, and
they have done that by requiring twice the amount of fuel from
non-specialists. For that scheme to have an effect on higher levels, they
had introduce high-level fuel components. 6c or 12c makes no difference to a
lvl29 weaponsmith, but 58c or 1s16c per component might. My feeling is that
few people will go through all the trouble of getting in touch, meeting and
swapping stuff to save this coin, so I don't think it'll be long before we
see the next adjustments to this balance between solo crafting and
partnership crafting.

Anyway, it's not as difficult to find your fuel as it first appears, because
you quickly learn which price corresponds to which base level. Merchants
could use a filter mechanism in their sell windows, though.

Agree 100%. Life as a crafter is easier now, but also less profitable and
more boring. In addition to balancing the classes, they could have done
something to make it easier to find business partners. Surely, SOE must soon
realize that the requirement to be logged in while selling (but not
necessarily present) only serves to speed up global warming.
