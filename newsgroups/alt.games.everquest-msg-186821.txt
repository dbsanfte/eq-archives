Well, I was going to toss out that physical stats don't really matter for
much, and, in any case, are easy to increase - especially with Paladin
class-specific armor.  Then I realized that someone rolling their first
character would have no understanding of that, and anyone rolling an alt
would know better than to play a Paladin, especially a half-elf one.

I'm not sure I can agree that we look cool.  Granted, my half-elf paladin
has a much better figure than my human bard (boy, I sure know how to pick
races for my class, don't I?), but I still can't get long hair for Precia,
my plate greaves have a thong, and our helms look like condoms.

Although, I will fully agree that we look better than Dwarves.  And we don't
get asked "A dwarf with a sword???  I didn't know clerics could carry
those..."
