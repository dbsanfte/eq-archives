The 2 don't have to be mutually exclusive.  I always keep autosplit
on.  And I don't group with ninja looters.  I have a problem with just
taking turns, cause some people then get screwed out of good stuff (or
even average stuff).

Sure someone who loots many empty corpses comes up a few coins ahead.
But if you only get a coin or 2 on your loot, you're missing out on the
good stuff.  So, I prefer alpha loot, loot until you get something
other than coins.  As you go up in levels, some items start to not
count against this, and the really good stuff is either evenly split or
rolled for.

No, it's not perfect.  But it's more fair than not getting any loot
because your corpse was bare.
