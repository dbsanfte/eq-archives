I was walking through North Qeynos and later Qeynos Hills while on one of my
alts a few days ago, and in one of those zones, I came up the corpse of a
dead NPC named Yollis Jenkins (I'm sure the last name is spelled right; I
may have the first name spelled wrong, though). No one was around, and I
waited until the corpse had 30 seconds until decay to loot, just in case.

I looted his head from the corpse, but I cannot find out what do with it;
the Beastiary site linked to Allakhazam's doesn't have this NPC listed, and
neither does Everlore (which is almost useless nowadays, in my opinion).

Does anyone know where I can find info on this quest? (I assume its for evil
characters)
