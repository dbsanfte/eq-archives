I started studying Calculus while I med.  May not be good for stuff like
this, but it's definatly something to do when you're medding.  I figure
since EQ is replacing going to college, I may as well get a little of that
in, too.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
