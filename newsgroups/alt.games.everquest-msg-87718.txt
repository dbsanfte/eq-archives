So you make it look like an *accident*. . .   /grins evilly  

Intentional training is very difficult to prove unless you make threats
first and you won't get warned/suspended/banned unless they can prove
you did it on purpose; otherwise, well, you *had* to pull the very
furthest mob because the problem group was hogging all the spawns below,
you thought they had cleared all the others. (BTW, GMs frown on that
sort of behavior (hogging all the spawns in an area) as well, play nice
policy and all that; they'd have to have brass balls to report you.) Or
your camo/invis broke at the worst possible time. Gee, you're sorry; too
bad they all died like that. . .  =P
