Sung bellow hits on the tic, or roughly every 6 seconds.  With most songs
this is perfectly adequate, since they last three tics, so if you (for some
reason)
wanted to leave one running, it wouldn't make any difference whether you
did start stops or just left it on.  With DD songs like Bellow, though,
if you start the song, stop the instant it goes off, then start again, you get a

hit every 4 seconds instead of one every 6 seconds.  So as with every other
bardic ability, the lazy bard has a significantly lower output than the hard
working, rythmically tuned up, nimble on the mouse bard.
