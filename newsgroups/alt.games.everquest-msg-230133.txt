Ok - new data that support your thesis.  (Either things have changed
since I did a lot of pet healing, or there are other factors).

Today I was using my BL pet to off tank adds in a 4 person group.
We got 4 in the PoI Factory and, even though I knew we were dead, I
peeled one off with the pets (mage and BL pet - bl pet can consistently
take aggro from the air pet on mobs its proc lands on) - tossed
a pet heal at the warder and got the 2 unhit adds on me, and away  
from the warrior, just as though I were a healer and had healed a PC.

So:

Datum 1:  With a cleric/mage duo, cleric CH'ing pet, mage nuking
moderately - the cleric could sit immediately and not get hit.

Datum 2:  With a warrior, cleric, BL, mage group - warrior actively
tanking one mob, pet actively tanking another - BL pet heal pulled
aggro on the untanked mobs.

Questions - Have the rules changed since I used to do 1?  (A long time
ago, because in PoP a mage has to chain to have a prayer of holding
a mob off)  Or are these two situations not mutually exclusive?
