I've read all the replys(so far) to this and at first glance it would appear as
if you were a little trigger happy. However I believe theres more to it than
that. There seems to be a general consensus in this newsgroup that most newbies
are clueless and rude. 
I had the same thing happen to me after starting another character but instead
of thinking 'oh its only a snake no great loss' I found myself thinking
'Fucking dumb KSing newbie, these are the people that everybody bitches about
in my newsgroup' instead of giving the guy the benefit of the doubt. And as for
the 'dont do it again' reply, in another thread where a druid, telling a story
about similar misbehaviour from another player and this was his exact response
and yet nobody thought it was innapropriate then.
I think if you subscribe to this newsgroup there is a fair to good chance you
will become a little biased in your opinion of newbies.
