Not so much, I'm an optimist myself, but heavily tempered by realism.

As far as history goes... in very broad strokes...

As our ability to control, exploit, and/or destroy larger chunks of 
population we have done so.

Communism works well at the community level, and breaks down shortly 
thereafter.

I suppose we must. However the 'Federation' we saw is almost a purely 
military arm, noble to be sure, and I actually do buy into it on some 
level; with the right leaders its possible to have the Federation 
militray. The mass of civilian humanity lives in some sort of 
incomprehensible state where they all appear to work at their chosen 
career/hobby, have their needs provided for, and enjoy life... details 
like who aspires to be the janitors and sewage technicians is glossed 
over...

Even the military still had court martials, rogue officers, etc etc 
etc... which suggests that they really aren't that different or evolved 
from us, and that there is corruption, greed, and ambition... all of 
which will undermine a communism... just as in Animal Farm.

Not sure what you mean. The original trilogy of 3, the extended 
'trilogy' of 5. Typically, I view the 'ones that came after' as the ones 
'authorized by the estate of Asimov' and written entirely by somone 
else... and which I have little to no interest in reading myself.

The final 2 books in the first trilogy cleverly tied together with the 
Robots novels (Caves of Steel, Robots of Dawn, The Naked Sun, Robots and 
Empire, etc) and even the galactic novels (The Stars Like Dust, Currents 
of Space, and Pebble in the Sky) to a much lesser degree. If you haven't 
read the previous series, particularly the Robot novels then the final 2 
foundation novels would indeed appear to dive into left field. Perhaps 
that's the issue??

On the contrary, I think the unique instances of in which shades of 
white interact make for a very thought provoking show,


Moreover...

Better still. I think this one area which B5 really got it right. In B5 
the elder races were the 'black' and 'white', but it wasn't good vs 
evil... it was order vs chaos... neither of which is truly better, and 
both of which were prepared to commit atrocities to prevail. That 
epiphany was a neat eye-opener for the series.
