Greetings!


   First of all, this is not a "ARGH I HATE VERANT NO PHAT LEWT I'M
QUITTING!!!" post.

   I've just got into Jumpgate and it's probably a temporary thing.  I
want to reduce cost, so I'm going to put my EQ account on hold for a
couple of months.

   Does anyone have any advice?  I've heard that it is sometimes a
good idea to sell equipment in this situation?  Any other precautions
I should take etc etc?

   Thanks.
