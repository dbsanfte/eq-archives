OK so by cahnging the data rate to a higher number 7,8,9 i should see
improvements to my game, given that I am on a very fast cable modem
(5mbps -1mbps).  I have read here, and on many boards that 9.0 is the
highest you can go without it just going back to the default 5.0.

My question is what hapens if you set it to 7.5 or 8.7?

I set it to 9 lastnight, but couldn't get it to boot up to the character
screen, so i brought it back to 7.  I am going to try other settings
tonight..

Thanks

Omiin
