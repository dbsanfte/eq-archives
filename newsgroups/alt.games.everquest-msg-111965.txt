Souns like it's bogus indeed.. A speed hack could be possible (maybe).
Player position is mostly done by the client, and if the difference is
not TOO big, the server could be fouled into thinking it is caused by
lag. But the program also claims to increase money. I'm pretty sure
thats all server side, so that wouldn't be possible..
