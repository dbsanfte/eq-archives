Perhaps the scale of the ninja looting played a part...but about two
months ago I took an alt on a Naggy raid where some piece of human
trash ninja'ed everything off the dragon's corpse and of course, went
LD.  The GM appeared within 10-15 minutes and logged the offender back
in.  He then handed over all the ill gotten loot to the raid leader
for us to roll on.  After that, the GM also gave us the name, class,
level, and race of his level 55 alt.

I would say that was justice.

I witnessed all of this.  Also, within a day I heard a report that the
alt was stripped after the GM reviewed his account and saw that it was
already flagged for previous altercations.  This may or may not be
true of course.

FYI, because it is possible to transfer servers, and because he may
not be smart enough to change names, watch out for anyone named
"Sidburn" (The alt) or "Arocus" (the SK).  (Sidburnx or Arocusx?)
