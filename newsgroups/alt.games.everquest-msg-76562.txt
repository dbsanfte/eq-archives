To answer the question you have 3 different things here :
1) Best way to level
2) Fastest way to level
3) Have fun with the game.

For most people (1) and (3) will be similar
For some people (2) and (3) will be similar
Almost never are (1) and (2) even close.

(3) is the easiest to answer. Just have fun. Ask for information here or
from players in game. Try to follow Jazz's rules below. Enjoy the
different classes races zones etc. and look forward to visiting lots
more.

For me (1) is much like (3) if you are having fun, and learning then you
are leveling the best way. Make friends and group. Find new hunting
spots. Learn new tacktics. This will help to make you a better player
and your character a more rounded one.

(2) is generally frowned on, especially for a first char. You could (RL)
pay or beg for power leveling, but this takes the chalange and thus the
fun out of the game and leaves you with a worse char in the end (Skills
not maxed games skills not learned)

To add to this (or perhaps replace a couple) :
x) do not expect to make money or useful items from trade skills with
your first character. It is _possible_ but blooming hard
x.1) Try to keep all your skills up, if you a melee class work on all
weapon skills bit. If you are a caster work on all your spell skills a
bit.
x.2) Expect to be very poor for a _long_ time. Your first char will live
hand to mouth for the first 20+ levels.
x.3) Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
x.4) Remember to spend training points on your new skills as you get
them. Rember to check when you get them. If you get taunt put a point
into that. (better safe than sorry)
x.5) Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.

HTH,

Jim
