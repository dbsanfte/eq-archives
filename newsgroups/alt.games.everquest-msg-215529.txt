It was the one there were the most reviews written of in recent computer 
mags.  I don't think SB Live or SB Live Value ever caught up with the 
sheer huge number of SB16's in circulation, though.  But that's largely a 
wild-assed guess.  I did a lot of research before plunking for the value 
version.  I remember hundreds of reviews saying yes, it was a very 
powerful card that would enhance my gaming experience, blah blah blah.  
But most of the reviews also, at some point, mentioned that the card 
itself seemed to have problems with certain software.

It came as very little suprise to me when it had serious issues with 
everquest.  I pulled it out and shoved in some cheap, generic card from a 
box with all Japanese writing on it, installed the default drivers that 
came with it, and haven't had a sound problem since, barring running more 
than three copies of EQ on the same machine at the same time with sound on 
in more than one.

As to the makeup of Sony's 1337 suite of test machines... I know the 
components of my machine are well represented.  How do I know?  I play on 
the test server from time to time.  Duh.  When I find bugs, I report bugs.  
The test server probably gets a fairly good cross section of the kinds of 
machines out there playing EQ connected to it, and it's actually a 
remarkably clever way to test the code, in my opinion.  That's how I know 
the code is also tested on Athlons, since I've been running those since 
Velious came out.

I've seen various problems that people were quick to attribute to "ohhh, 
it must be because you have an Athlon CPU!"  But I've yet to have such a 
problem that didn't turn out to be something else entirely.  I'm not sure 
of this 'Umbra' problem you're talking about, the only umbra problem I 
remember was related to having a graphics card that didn't support umbra 
when they turned it on as the default for everyone, and they -told- people 
you have to go edit the line in the eqclient.ini, and nobody listened.
But I don't see what that has to do with whether your CPU's an Athlon.  I 
don't see that at all.  Sorry.

Oh hmm.  I forgot to flame DT, and that's usually fun.  Bah, I'll save it 
up for some time when he's actually wrong.  It's more fun then.
