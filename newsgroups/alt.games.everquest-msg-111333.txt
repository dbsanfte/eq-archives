Well, not particularly "fun," but it's a toy....  Chardok is a great place
for toys.  So far all the items I saw have a few points of AC, and around 25
or 35 Mana/HP plus effect.  Not great, but not too bad, either!  My druid
friend has a fairly decent stat earring that also has the right-click effect
of  Scale of Wolf.  Usually that spell isn't worth casting, but when you
don't have to take up a spell slot and you're doing a lot of running, it's a
nice little item.

My enchanter has an earring with enc damage shield (11hp), and a Illusion:
High Elf ring (handy sometimes when you play a gnome, despite it being an
uglier than sin race illusion...I'd much prefer troll or iksar) (btw, my
gnome is a racist and damned proud of it :) ).

My mage has a Everfount ring (or maybe earring, I forget...I have to get him
up to 42 before I can use it <g> ).
