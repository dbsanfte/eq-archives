You don't? You mean the security of Ireland is maintained without
people? You don't have police there? I am painfully aware of the
troubles in Ireland, and I have my opinions about them, but besides
that, do you maintain the peace some what I am not aware of? How do
you keep people from robbing your banks?

If you play EQ the military population is pretty high. Odds are you
do.

I don't know about you, but most here join the services in a mutually
beneficial relationship. Most don't join to kill others.

I am glad you live there. That is a pretty selfish attitude. There is
little to gain politically or economically except the preservation of
the freedom to trade in that part of the world. The left trades on
this accusation daily, and they have more to gain from that than
anything the US will win.

The US has interests there, and the hue and cry of the liberal
governments to leave Sadaam alone may be viewed the same as the early
appeasement of Hitler.

But I digress, my OP dealt purely with the human aspect of this war.
