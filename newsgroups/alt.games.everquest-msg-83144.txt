You've heard lots of things; all, unfortunately, wrong.

I have reported 2 dupe bugs.  One of them, I duped every single item
on me, cash and gear.  What I got was a chance to sit on my butt for 5
hours waiting for a GM, as the Guide said he could do nothing and that
I'd have to wait for him.  Due to the circumstances, I didn't dare
fight or log off.
