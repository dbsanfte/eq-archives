Hello,

I just started playing EQ three days ago.  So far I have only been
playing solo, but I would like to group up with some other players.  I
am a level 5 half-elf warrior, based out of Freeport.  How do I go
about finding other players to group with?  What would be good classes
to look for to group with?  Is it too early in my game for me to even
be thinking about finding other people to play with?

Thanks for your help.

Paul
