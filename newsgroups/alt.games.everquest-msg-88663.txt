One of our Leezards moved his bind point to the bazaar just after Luclin
came out for convenience, banking, porting, etc. No problems reported in
those areas. Out in the "big" zones, Catta, etc. you may have problems,
but I haven't tested this myself. I know Trolls are "unwelcome" in a
couple of those spots. But the stuff under the surface near where you
zone in you should be fine for.
