I tried out the texture caching, and the results
are very good.

On a 500MhZ Celeron w/512MB RAM:

  Without texture caching (average of 3 runs):

    Server-select to character-select:  2 minutes, 44 seconds.
    Character-select to in-game:        1 minute,  15 seconds.

  With texture caching:

    Server-select to character-select:  0 minutes, 51 seconds.
    Character-select to in-game:        0 minute,  58 seconds.

So that's a 69% reduction in time for the initial game load,
and a 22% reduction in time for bringing a character into
the game.  VERY nice.

I didn't test zoning times, but they should be considerably
accelerated as well, since I noticed that the game also
caches textures on a per-zone basis (any zone you pass
through gets cached the first time you hit it, then the
cache is used when entering the zone thereafter).

And the amount of disk space used wasn't as bad as
the patch message would have you believe.  I had
*all* new character models and animations loaded, and
those plus all global textures plus a few really big
Luclin zones (including Katta Castellum) took only
80MB of cache file size.  (Cache files are saved in
your EQ directory as xxxx.TXC).  On the other hand,
I have my texture quality set to "Low", so your
mileage may vary.

Overall, a great improvement, bravo.  I no longer
have to go make a sandwich to help pass the time when
loading the game.  It's quite snappy, perhaps even
faster than the pre-Luclin game.
