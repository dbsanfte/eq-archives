Freedom of speech means I can say whatever I want, to whomever I want, about
whatever I want, whenever I want.  I fought for the freedom you take for
granted.  Can you say the same, or are you one of those tree-hugging
activists who thinks the military that provides the blanket of protection
you sleep under should be downsized?

Hypocrite.

And since I called you that a total of 5 times now, go ahead and contact my
ISP.  Make sure you tell them that you got this information from a video
game newsgroup and that you're a thin-skinned hypocritical (there I go
again) puss.
