Interesting idea, though it doesn't do anything for SKs.  How would you code
them, 50-50?

I play a Wizard as my primary, an Enchanter as a secondary, a Bard as my
third, a Mage as my fourth.  Paladin comes in around six or so; and I don't
play a warrior at all.  I spend my time RELYING on a tank, not being one.
Nerfing knight-class taunt down to the point where they can't keep aggro
better than a warrior will not make warriors more desired, it merely makes
all tanks LESS desirable.  Should I give gentle lovetaps to a mob so I won't
taunt it off a tank, or should I go find a group with no melees at all where
I can open up with full effectiveness?  Ever hear of mezz-bombing?  Ever
hear of a group of five pet classes going into LDON and *destroying* the
zone?  (Did it with my mage.  WHEEE fun!)  And don't get me started with
PBAOE.  If Sony breaks the knight classes, all that does is encourage me to
find a better way.

The answer isn't to break knights, it's to fix warriors.  But don't count on
Furor (who is and always has been a troll of the worst sort) to find a good
way to do it; all he's really concerned with is getting attention for
himself.
