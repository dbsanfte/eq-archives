Not a voodoo. For the life of me I can't recall the name, but it's the
default choice that comes with IBM's black boxes. And as mentioned in a
different follw-up post, it was because I was playing a tall troll. Too
tall for the game to handle yet apparently. The motion framerate for the
human sized characters was pretty much fine.

Keyboard. And yes, "sensitive" is putting it mildly. ;-)
