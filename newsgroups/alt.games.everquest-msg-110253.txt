I am with BTopenworld and have not noticed any particular down turn in
service since the price dropped. Past couple of days the lagometer has been
stuttering a bit and was dropped at one point but not much real change over
the BT shite service.

I think Freeserve or Demon would be the better options and I will probably
sign with these once my BTopenworld year is up as these two ISPs have much
better routing that BT. e.g. I play at work on Freeserve anytime dial up on
56.6 modem and get better consistency on the lagometer
