Combined with the new taunt failure message, this is actually better
IMO than "just fixing taunt".  A plan, BTW, which does nothing to
address the lack of utility of other pure melee in the group/raid.

Here's how - Warrior successfully taunts and now is at the top of
the hate list by 1 point over the person previously at the top.  If
that person out aggros the warrior before taunt comes up again, he's
getting pasted until it cycles - then has to take the chance it 
will fail.

With the new system - Warrior taunts successfully (and knows it thanks
to the new message) and immediately hits his no-opening aggro increaser.

Bam - He's not only at the top of the hate list, he has breathing room
at the top of the hate list.

Don't count on it actually working out that way.  They tried to set
the raiding casters apart from their non-raiding counterparts a long while
back with the Ancient lines of spells - a total flop, they didn't 
continue it and it's a complete non-starter.

Seperate timers will do - give some folks a reason to hotkey more than
one disc.

Did you miss the line about the ability to tie those buttons to the
keyboard?

I think with the relative smallness of the gap in HP between Knight
and Warrior, 4% might be a little low (that's what people are parsing).

Or a ranger - they have it even worse.  With his current bow my buddy
has to hit a key every 1.5 seconds to make maximum use of his DPS.

Which they said in the initial press release - then a ton of monks,
rogues and warriors went apeshit about hybrids getting them.  Guess 
reading comprehension wasn't their strong suit.

If you greatly increase their taunt and beef up their damage soaking 
abilities - there is no longer a need for knights - just like it used to
be.

The problem with a 50 warrior not getting a mob off a 40 ranger is simple-
stupid ranger.

He pretty cleary said they scale around delay - the number of openings per
unit time will stay (nearly) constant.  Low delay weapons do not give much
more in the way of openings.

If anyone tells you to taunt more, ask them if they know how taunt works.

Now, it's possible that, even if the mob is beating on you, you're not at
the top of the hate list (range modifiers) and taunting continually is 
actually raising your hate.  But if you are at the top of the hate list,
taunting does nothing.

Why grrr?  ".... a new skill that doesn't require an opening."

That's a hate increaser - something TOTALLY different from taunt, more
along the lines of pally stuns and sk/ranger snares/dots - something that
adds X amount of hate.  This is a good thing; it's that ability to keep
adding hate at will that sets them apart from warriors.
