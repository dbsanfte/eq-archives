    I've cut out one intermediate poster's comments, and corrected your
bizarre "middle-posting". Now, read what I've written: "I think the
bottleneck is BS, too. But I understand why Verant feels it has to be
there." Tell me what part of that represents uberguild jealousy. I want them
to enter the game world as fast as other useful epics do, too. VI doesn't
want it, because it'll let people fly through content VI wants them to slog
through. Capiche? And for the record: if some guild wants to take mobs down
by cheerfully de-levelling themselves, they have my full support.
