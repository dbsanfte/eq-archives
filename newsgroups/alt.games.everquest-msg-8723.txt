I would venture to say you haven't played a troll very much, or you're the
luckiest bastard in Norrath. After playing my troll for nearly 30 levels now, I
can tell you with complete confidence and accuracy that Trolls *can be* and
*are* stunned from the front with annoying frequency.  Last night in the warrior
room in HHK we had the spawn broken up nicely so that we were most always
fighting only one mob at a time and I was still stunned on several occasions.
And no, I didn't have my back to him. I was tanking.
