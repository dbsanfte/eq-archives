Recently I took a pickup-group with me to Nadox romaing from one end
of the dungeon to the other for hours,comments were although
the xp "sucks" they never had  that much fun in EQ before.
Grieg's End is another example of another dungeon which requires
roaming,and is quite busy on my server.
Veksar,Droga,HS,Chardok etc  dont make much sense too to sit in one
spot with a group.Since OoW BoT has become a zone too,where you
can roam nicely,killing the placeholders all over the place and hoping
for named respawn is fun.
So I wouldnt agree with your statement of "become the norm",maybe
at higher levels it is true,note that my 55,26 Ranger gets more
playtime than my 67,230 Ranger,I really hate sit-at-home groups,and
people I find in this spots are mostly not fun to play with,especially
those with the double xp reaward turned on screaming for faster pulls
makes me leave those spots fast,I like the level 60 slowers with no
AAs in WoS too.  :p

Sorry to say this, cause I have more Warrior friends than other tank
classes,but especially at lower levels you should be careful if the
tank is a Warrior,he has a harder time to get the aggro away from the
puller than knights(Stuns,Clinging darkness line).

No more "nasty" corpse recoveries since DoN.

Let me add "very long range pulling" with bow,depending on zone you
can shoot in a crowd of mobs from the furthest possible distance away
and only one will come.
Well,I know this is a questionable strategy,just like pet pulling,more
an exploit,and making use of bad coding.

Let me add,there are 2 outstanding classes for pulling,Monk and Bard,
I would never do a hard Ldon without one of these.

My 67 Ranger with only 2 levels of combat agility for defense AAs can
tank in WoS,and I tank all the time in HF and Unrest instances.
Recently when playing my 65 Cleric ,I had a Ranger tanking in The
Ascent,and had no problems staying fm as usual.
My 55 Ranger tanks much better than my 67 Ranger in the appropriate
zones,pointless to split the role of puller and tank with him in a
group,he draws too much aggro with 1350 attack and 2 weapons with
2 damage procs each.
I am not an advocat of Ranger tanking,much more prefere a real tank
in group(who can hold aggro :)  ).
So for the "every day xp grind" group a Ranger can do fine tanking.
I see Bsts and Monks tanking too with not too much problems.
Game has changed drastically with regard to tanking abilities,very
good gear available for cheap,the effect is most noticable on below
level 60 game,saw an Ornate Chain Tunic pattern for 10k lately,going
price is around 20k,and at 55 when you can wear it is "uber".
True tanks are needed for nameds and on raids,although
I sometimes may tank the boss too until Weaponshield wores off.  :p

Hm,could solo tank-melee-nuke throughtout my entire career with my now
65 Cleric,again its the cheap gear available now,and clerics are
somewhat different from other caster classes,being plate wearers.
My (retired) 45 Enchanter was tanking for pet in Dulak,no outside hp
buffs.

Additinally it creates huge aggro,my Rangers love Tangling Weeds when
tanking.

Very good point.

Charm does wonders for Enchanter dps,every Vxed or Tipt trial I did
was with an Enchanter using a charmed mob.(wasnt much fun for my 
Ranger reduced to the roll of a snarer *sigh*)
