Don't think that would hold water... You go play EQ while your friend uses
your SW Galaxies account to play  simultaneously.  Unless servers across
games were linked, this would go undetected.

Also, they would go out of business.  They have staff, equipment, production
costs of a new game, yet not making any more money off of it then the
initial fee.  This would be a bad business plan.

Besides, this is capatilism... Companies strive to make the most money they
can.
