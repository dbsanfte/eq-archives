That entriely depends on what the Wizard is doing. Generally in groups
you'll have plenty of gems, but when soloing, I'd have a hard time
with 7 slots.

Here's what the basic wiz spell requirement looks like:
-Big/Mana efficient nuke
-Medium/Hard to resist nuke
-Snare
-Root
-Concussion (group) or damage shield (solo)
-Harvest
-Stun
-Evac

I can think of several options for the 9th. For soloing, I'd probably
opt for a second stun, or invisibiliy, depending on what I'm doing.
