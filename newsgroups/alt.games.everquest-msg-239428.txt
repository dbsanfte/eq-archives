LOL! i write this post just cuz i'm mad at some newb and come back two days
later to find out that it has become a discossion on Hitler! LOL! LOL! LOL!
anywho, my response to the whole Hitler thing is this:
i think that it is wrong to desciminate against someone simply because they
say Hitler is "smart."  after all, can you not admire someone who is evil,
not because they are evil, but because they are smart?  it is a hard concept
for some to grasp.  they see the world as good & evil, yin & yang, black &
white; they do not see the "gray" areas inbetween.  an observer can disagree
with what someone stands for, but still admire that person, or even a single
atribute that that particular person had.  for instance, Hitler was one of
the greatest speakers in history (you'd have to be to get an entire nation
to do what they did) who has even been compared to Jesus.  does this mean
what he was saying was right?  no, it doesn't.  so, i can say that Hitler
was a great speaker without agreeing with what he spoke about.  get it?  so
when Scott said that Hitler was "smart," he was simply pointing out a skill
at which Hitler excelled, not necessaraly agreeing with what he used this
skill to do.  so simply because one is against Hitler, it does not mean that
he has to say Hitler had no skills and was a mere blob of human flesh who
never amounted to anything.
