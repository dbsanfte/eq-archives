I was fooling around with a barb shaman last night (levelled to 5 very
quickly BTW). If I casr Sicken on myself I am hit for something like
5pts of damage. In addition my HP counter turns red and my natural
base regen does not increase my HP as long as the spell is in effect
and I am standing. Very similar to having Rabies.

Cheers
