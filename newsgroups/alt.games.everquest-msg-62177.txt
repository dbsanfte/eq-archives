No.  The Tom's Hardware article indicates that SDRAM is the slowest. BUT the
MX400 which can use DDR, doesn't allow for enough data lines to let the DDR
work as designed, i.e. it's crippled.  So the affect (this is an MX400
issue) is DDR and SDRam have the same throughput, hence manufacturers use
the cheaper one.  With the Pro and Ti GeForce2 cards and GeForce3, this
limitation is gone so if someone is using SDRam then you're getting an
inferior product.

RDRAM is similar to DDR in performance (but not cost) so it's fine.  This
ram of course is for the MB where as the above discussion is on the video
card itself.
