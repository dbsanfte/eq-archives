You didn't imply that... I brought up the question.  And I don't know 
that the answer is yes; I've just sort of assumed it was.

I -think- for the most part that player made items cost more to make 
than current bazaar price on comperable dropped items.

But I haven't done any research to support that in the past 4 years or 
so since giving up on smithing in disgust, its possible that my 
impression is very outdated.

Ah, see, I didn't know those were player made.  Aye they are quite nice, 
and if I don't get my epic I'll be interested in getting one, sadly they 
aren't usuable under level 60 so thus far they aren't actually something 
I'm shopping for.  But I also have to say that they definately aren't 
available at 11kpp, is that cost to make?  If so, and if there are no 
drops involved beyond that cost, then some GM smiths are making a pretty 
penny.

My somewhat casually equipped (no raid gear, no LDoN gear) 53 berserk is 
at 41 standing HP regen with no AA.  My 65 cleric is at 2 FT (also, 
admittedly, with no AA in it).  Thats a 20 to 1 ratio.  So thats about 
equal... which would be fine if every spell in the game was as efficient 
as CHeal, and if a 65 should be in about the same gear as a 53.

I think most spells cost out at about 4 hp per mana, either in terms of 
damage healed or damage done.  Slows and Hastes and DS might be as 
efficient as CHeal.

Well then the benefit is smaller than I think... but its still there

Only for someone standing in front of the mob, or working on a mob with 
DS up.  As a former cleric I have almost no sympathy for anyone hitting 
a mob with DS in the mid to high end of the game; clerics remove DS with 
laserlike precision... besides which, having done that job, I'm aware 
how very few exp/small group mobs have any DS at all, heck, not many 
raid mobs have one.

As for Riposte, the trick is to not stand in front of the mob.  Since 
this trick also increases your DPS by an estimated 15%, I like riposte a 
lot, it encourages the non MT people to go where they -should- go.

But in either case, looking at a specific mob and deciding to swap out 
the one handers for a two hander would be an example of tactical 
thinking; responding to your situation.  Making it so there's no penalty 
for using one style over the other just dumbs down the game, IMO.

Would depend on the proc, many of the ones I'm interested in I'm in no 
hurry for; DS, Primal, Snare.  Clearly damage procs are out, same to a 
slightly lesser extent for a couple other ones I'd like to get, Slow and 
Jolt.

I'm not as aware of available melee weapons as I might be, having mostly 
avoided melee characters, and even now being stuck with the much more 
limited selection of two handers (and BER usable ones at that).    So 
I'm generalizing from what I have seen others use, and from the couple 
items I have played with; primal, snare, tash, and DD weapons on my 
cleric, DS proc weapon on my zerker.

Soloing melee or melee in groups without slowers.  I've been in quite a 
few of those, and seen quite a few groups where a proc was the slow in 
use.  I'll admit, I wouldn't offhand the slow... but I certainly would 
swap it out when it stuck, and yet the main weapon would have to be a 
LOT better not to prefer slow weapon till proc happens on any mob thats 
more than a sneeze to knock down.
