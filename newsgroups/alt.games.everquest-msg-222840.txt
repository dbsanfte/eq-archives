Looking forward to any reports on this. I'll check Halas tonight.

Huh? Does this mean there will be some bonus loot on the final drop? What
exactly does this mean? Whatever it is, I sure like the sound of it!

I realize these two are controversial. I don't find them surprising at all,
having just returned to the game from 8 months of Star Wars Galaxies. Maybe
some of the same code was used, it worked quite effectively there and I
always wondered why it wasn't done in EQ. More importantly, the targeting
ring is a long overdue fix to an old problem. It'll now be much easier to
distinguish one elusive cryptrobber from the other two that are engaged.
Yea, I know /assist is supposed to facilitate that now, but I can think of
many instances in which I've wished that the additional graphical input was
available (above and beyond the flashing name text, which I always found
took too long to visually parse).

LOL! Now that's optimism!
