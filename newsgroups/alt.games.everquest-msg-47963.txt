Quite possibly true in theory, but not really parsable without removing
the bonus from each primary attack. What it comes down it is fast
primary = more damage as long as the weapons are comparable. You can
take an extreme like 2/15 primary, 25/25 secondary, and obviously the
above won't hold true, but for realistic comparisons it's a good
guideline
