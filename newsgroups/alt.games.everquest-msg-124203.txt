That's not right either.

That is not the only difference between a hub and a router. You may be
thinking of a switch, but that assumption is still not correct.
A switch has a backplane size (usually in Megabits or some in Gigabits), and
that bandwidth is shared across all the ports.

Also:
Hub = Unintellegent (just splits bandwidth)
Switch = Intelligent - Layer 2 (routes MAC hardware address)
Router = More Intelligent - Layer 3 (routes information based on IP
addresses)
