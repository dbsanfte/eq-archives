Maybe I'm not understanding how Taunt works properly, but if I am this
seems to be a bad plan.  As I understand it, a successful Taunt will
raise your "hate" to be one greater than whoever is at the top of the
list.  Top of the list is <not> the same as who currently has agro,
Root, proximity, sitting, and extreme low health all affect which
target the mob trys to beat on.  [Example:  I was pseudo-PLing my
Shaman by 2boxing my Warrior.  The Warrior was using H2H primary and
a Gnoll-hide Lariat secondary to hold the mob's attention without
KSing the Shaman.  At first, when I would sit the Shaman down to med
after DoTing and Slowing a mob I would get instant agro, even when I
waited a while before sitting so the Warrior could build more hate.
Then I tried having the Warrior Taunt twice after I cast on the mob
(figuring he was likely to succeed one out of two tries) and the
problem evaporated.  I know that the Shaman had more hate than the
Warrior after casting because when I wanted to work on his melee
skills I would just use the Warrior to get single pulls and hold the
mob in place while I stuck my afflictions on it, the mob would always
turn on the Shaman as soon as he got within melee range (thereby
gaining a proximity modifier similar to the Warrior's).]  So, to
return to why it seems to me that constant mashing of the Taunt button
is a bad plan for an MT, if you're already at the top of the hate list
a successful Taunt will either do nothing, or much worse, could reduce
your hate if they implemented it without a check to see whether you
were already on top (assuming my understanding of Taunt is correct).
Also, if somebody manages to draw agro (like the CLeric who's healing
all that damage you're taking) and you've just hit your button, you
can't do a thing about it until Taunt recycles.

just my $.02
