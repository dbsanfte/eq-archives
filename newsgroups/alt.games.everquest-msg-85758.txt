Actually, while the Barbarians *were* the first creations of the Marr
twins, they spent more time imspiring enlightenment in some of the
raging hordes. These were the ancestors of the Humans and, it seems,
the Combine Empire. Hence,

Marr twins --> Humans 

The current Barbarians are the children the Marr twins 'forgot', and
instead of doing grunt work for the socalled enlightened Humans, they
went their own ways and followed their own ideas.

Heck, whoever created the Vah Shiir is never worshipped by them and
you don't see that deity complaining (other than when Tunare
wrongfully gets credit on the non-agnostic servers :) )
