Yes, I'm not particularly fond of the Pledge (my allegience goes to
my fellow americans and the Constitution that defines the basis for
our republic, not to some bits colored cloth sewn together).  But,
IMO, adding the phrase "under God" to it was short-sighted and should
have long since been reversed.

Substituting "pandering to single-issue" for "reaching out to" and
"as" for "looking like" would raise your score from 98% to 100%.

[foolishly attempting a guess at what goes on in Sanjian's mind:]
I think it's more like he does take occasional objective looks at
"what the conservative horn's been saying" and, breathing a sigh
of relief at finding nothing so odious that it makes him start
gagging instantly, he quickly looks away and resumes tooting.
At least that's how I've seen others reconcile thoughtfulness
with partisanship.

I don't know if you read his campfire metaphor elsewhere in this(?)
thread, but I think there's quite a fair bit of truth in it.  And
I sometimes find it annoying that all of the nice warm spots are
taken by people that I simply cannot bring myself to associate with.
