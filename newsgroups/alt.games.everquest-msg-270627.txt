Notice the 'friends,' regardless of how good people they are, aren't
exactly being friends.  They're just people you know, maybe like, but
who run in different circles from you.

I call those 'aquaintances,' not friends.

Why bend them?  That would just make you both a bad friend and a bad
person.

Better would be to seek out folks who already have similar goals, than
to force either yourself or your 'friends' to bend from what they seem
to enjoy.  Hence, get better friends.
