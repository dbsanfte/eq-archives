Ahh.. like Baseball? Football? Soccer? Hockey? Ya.. the idea that
sports and games in general.. whether they be online computer games or
not, is JUST a game went out of style years ago.

Since Monopoly is a game designed not to be able to transfer items
into and out of the game it doesn't apply. MMORPG's are a different
beast because they actually design player-based economies into their
game. They have facilities where you can buy and sell the various
items. You don't think the one in Everquest showed up by chance do
you? Tying those economies into real-world economies is not only the
logical next step, but quite a few people are doing it allready
anyways. 

Even for Monopoly, the huge benefit though is in being able to backend
the account payments through your isolated Gaming Account. No more
credit cards and what not over the net, and the money is federally
insured and drawing interest. So you can sign up for online Monopoly
using your Gaming Account by just using public-key encryption from a
storage device you keep in your wallet to verify your identity with
the bank through the game and thereby transfer the funds needed to get
it started.

In fact, a game company.. once your identity is verified through the
bank.. that you have an account there with the money to play.. need
not ever ask you a single question concerning your identity. Should
you engage in any tomfoolery in game they simply report you to the
authorities with a complaint, suspend the account, and have the
authorities subpeona the bank records as part of their criminal
investigation into the complaint. It makes things loads simpler for
the game companies when dealing with online content.
