The general formula is (level plus one) times five, but there are exceptions:
clerics, shaman, and druids, are limited to (level plus one) times four for
weapon skills, while Enchanters, Mages, Necromancers, and Wizards
are limited to (level plus one) times three.  There appear to be other
spot differences, for example my rogue seems to be limited to (level plus
one) time 6 for dual weild, and my monk to (level plus one) time seven
for the same!

I'd like to point you towards a good compilation of these limits, but
I have no idea where you'd find it.
