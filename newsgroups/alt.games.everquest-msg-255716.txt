No, this is true, it's not soccer.  But we (mostly) also played soccer 
after school.  So it was what happens when a bunch of soccer players solo.  
So during that time, there -was- such a thing as a solo soccer player.

Similarly, in EQ, you could argue that people who solo are not playing 
Group EQ.  That doesn't mean there's no such thing as a soloing EQ 
player...

Zackly.

But then, what do I know.  I raid.  Admittedly, I am pretty casual about 
it. :)

I notice those defending the gear disparities are quick to point out how 
'uber' the LDoN stuff is... Personally, as a somewhat Elemental class 
player, I've yet to see anything on an LDoN merchant chart I'd wear.  On 
the whole, it looks roughly comparable to Ornate, at best.  And I'm behind 
the fully-elemental people, the Time people, and whatever matters in GoD 
people.

Some folks are failing to appreciate that the LDoN stuff -is- 5th or 6th 
best.  Some of the folks in this thread -are- just whining about how 
elemental-class gear should be handed to them on a silver platter, no 
doubt.  But others have what looks to me like a legitimate gripe.  If 
you're in a family-style guild that can field two groups, LDoN stuff is 
about the best you can reasonably ever hope to get, no matter how many 
zillions of hours you sink into it, and it's still pretty low on the totem 
pole.  All they're really asking for is content that doesn't require a 
-massive- raid, and results at some point in something approaching what I 
have.  Stuff like maybe the Coldain Shawl.  No sane raider would argue, I 
don't think, that a casual, generally soloer-type should be forbidden to 
get the shawl because it's -really- pretty comparable with elemental 
loot... And the last fight can be single grouped pretty readily.  A family 
guild might need two groups, but still, doable.

Unfortunately, the shawl is a fairly isolated example.  It sounds like 
there may be some good stuff in GoD that fits this bill... I don't know 
GoD well enough to say, yet.

The debate about GoD velium crafted weapons amuses me, though.  Someone 
says 'gosh, they aren't even as good as top-end Luclin stuff' and someone 
follows up showing that they are nearly, but not quite, as good as top-end 
Luclin...  Very good, but the point, I thought, was that Luclin was -four- 
expansions ago...
