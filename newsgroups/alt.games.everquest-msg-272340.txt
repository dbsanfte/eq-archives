IIRC, there's some rumor the EQ2 cap is eventually supposed
to be 200.   I've no idea at to that rumor's accuracy, but it's
not all that unrealistic, either.

Bottom line:  there's no reason to believe an EQ level is the
same as an EQ2 level -- any more than an EQ level from
64-65 is the same as an EQ level from 21-22.

But:  for what it's worth -- EQ2 advancement seems to be
roughly equal to EQ advancement, with the mid-levels
beginning earlier.   Strictly on a numeric basis, anyway.
