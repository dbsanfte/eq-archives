Ouch!

A couple of months ago, in halas, I gave my wife a Bloodforge Hammer and a
+3 str neck thingy to hold for me.  I brought up my druid and asked for them
back.  She was doing pottery and her mind was elsewhere. She handed them
back to me and quickly hit the button so she could go back to her skills.  I
was standing next to an npc.  She never noticed it was a give screen and not
a trade screen.  Maybe that was why she offered the 30pp this time. hehe

C'est la vie
