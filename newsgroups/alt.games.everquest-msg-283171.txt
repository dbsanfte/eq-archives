still could be your card, could be any number of factors that can be 
tweaked in-game(clip plane being the biggest culprit there) or could be 
your connection or a thousand different other things.  

you may not have as much trouble in the rest of the game except for the 
city-zones.  it'll probably still be laggy in spots no matter what you 
do especially considering that you are using a laptop.  EQ and EQ2 have 
never been very good on laptops.

you can try the official forums but i'm not sure if you'll be able to 
post there before you have a paid account.
