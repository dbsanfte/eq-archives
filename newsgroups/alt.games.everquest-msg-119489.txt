In order to solo effectively, its often necessary to deal with Adds.
You
cant rely on a chanter on mez duty to do so, and you may not
have the option of harmony.  Lull simply sucks as long as it stays
"broken as intended."

Something I've seen done successfully, though, is to root or
snare your intended target, then run the rest of the mobs to
guards (basically anything that isn't KOS to you but is to
your followers.

Something I've wondered about just now, though, is charm.  If
you bring a charmed mob in that those "guards" will normally
be KOS to, will they attack it?  Or will they react as they
would to you, instead  (since the mob is your pet)

What if you charm a mob that the guards are busily killing?  Do
they now hate you too?  Or do they leave off killing it?  If the
latter this would be a fantastic tool, as the guards could be
relied on to do most of the work, then you could swipe the
mob out from under them and go take it somewhere to finish
it off in private.  I've done something similar as a cleric, using
the coldain to help me kill Drakkal Wolves and giants in
GD, then rooting the guards when the mob starts to run, followed
with a quick atone on the guard so he forgives me for rooting him.

Anyone else have guard related tactics to share?
