Hi All

A friend of mine had his map window set to open up in the top right of
his game window, and now, because of the Atlas patch, the bar to move
the window around is off the top of the screen.

He has changed resolution, can then move the window to a different
place, but on changing back to the resolution he likes to use, the map
window is back at the place where it was prior to the rez change.

Any way to force the map window back into full view?  We saw a post in
a forum that said /resetwindows would move the GUI's windows back to
default, but this is not the case.

Thanks in advance  :)
