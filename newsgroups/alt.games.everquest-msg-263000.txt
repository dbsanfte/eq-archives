Just a few days ago we had a hell of a time keeping a 65 warrior alive
in WoS.  He had something around 6k HP.  He knew his gear sucked and
he made sure we knew it when he joined.  I was afraid to pull even the
field 1 named, the way his HP dropped on the trash.  He would grab
agro on a regular Chimera or Feran and the first round would drop his
HP 20% to 30%.  No one thought he was a bad player--just wasnt geared
for it.

And this was just the trash and easy named.  Imagine a group wanting
to do some of the tougher named in WoS--the ones that hit for 1.4k or
whatever the hell they hit for.  Can a 6k tank handle that?  No.  Can
a cleric with no FT handle that?  Almost definitely.  I don't know if
this is unfair or the facts of life but its definitely true that the
gear does a lot more a warrior than it does for some other characters.

Now that said, I would never ask your HP and AC before inviting to a
group.  I just know why it is important and why it is still tempting
to ask...

It's also not just the tank.  It used to be quite common that someone
would ask if my ranger had eq/am3 before getting an invite.  Also,
people will remember bad experiences.  If the mobs are dying slow, its
not always obvious to everyone that the rogue is using a fine steel
sabre, or the wizard is casting ice comet at level 70.  Even when the
Cleric is constantly OOM because he has a 2k mana pool, or no FT, or
whatever, the blame will end up being placed on others.  (Stop taking
agro, you're not slowing fast enough, the tank doesnt have enough HP,
etc...)  It is painfully obvious though, when the warrior's HP are
dropping too fast.
