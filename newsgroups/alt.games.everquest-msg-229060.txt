Try the bazaar now, bags are sellable via tokens.

Augments drop in LDoN adventures, and can also be purchased with points 
earned in LDoN adventures.  AFAIK there is no other way to get augments 
at this time.

Augments are combined with the item in question in a bird bath looking 
thing that is located near each wayfarer camp.  The augment slot type 
must be compatible with a slot type available on the item you are putting 
it on.

Paludal caverns, if what you want is xp.
