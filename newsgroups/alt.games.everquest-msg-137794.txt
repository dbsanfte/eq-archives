They are no different however they do NOT enjoy the same rights as the
"rest of us." Tiny example: they can choose to spend their entire
lives in a relationship with a partner, but if that partner passes
away, 99 times out of 100 the partner's family will suddenly appear
out of nowhere to claim all his assets, leaving the survivor not only
alone but broke as well. Against the wishes of the deceased, no less.
It's absolute bullshit and it needs to stop.

Now, you're still going to sit there and say it shouldn't be an issue,
right? It's not "special" rights, it's just *rights.*
