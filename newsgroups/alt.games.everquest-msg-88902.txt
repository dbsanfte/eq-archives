Yup, that is "4-door".  Is this name really unique to Bristlebane?
Interesting...

I suspect the name comes from the "old days" of early Kunark, when it
would be quite a challenge for a group of low 50's to hold this camp.
They were there mainly for the 4 named behind these doors, and didn't
even try to kill the other spawns in the area (back towards Emperor).
Just sitting there holding that room and killing wanderers.  Perhaps
your puller pulled from the surrounding areas, but everybody else just
sat there totally focused on the "4 doors", waiting for their Heiro
Cloak.  After sitting there for hours staring at those 4-doors, what
else to call it? ;-P

In answer to some other message I didn't quote, I have never seen
anybody just call Emperor, but I guess if you are in 4-door and also
doing Emperor, you call out "4-door/Emp" just to disuade anybody from
coming down to try to share that area with you (if Seb was really
crowded, for instance).  I don't ever recall seeing two groups in
there past that locked door, though.
