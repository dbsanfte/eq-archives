I did actually start out doing that cast it over and over again, but, well,
my interest waned after a couple hundred casts, and maybe 2 skill ups on the
specialization.  So, I went out and played instead, knowing, worst case, I
can always fix it anyway.  As it turns out, I am quite happy with Alteration
anyway, most buffs and heals are Alteration based, as well as my slow line
of spells.
