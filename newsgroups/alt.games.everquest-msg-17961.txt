I think its just lazy ass players, not doing a /w, as was said before,
either that or too young to be playing or just plain stupid.  Always getting
people saying what lvl u? What class u? ... My response, "try a /w "my name"
all and find out, I am not anon"

Doing a bit of trading the other night in EC tunnel, somehow ended up with a
Messenger of the Queen, so I thought... I'll start a Pally, got a full set
of banded in the bank, should be a good laugh....by the time he was lvl 6,
he had been asked for SoW, heal, buffs, pp's, you name it....Grrrrr
