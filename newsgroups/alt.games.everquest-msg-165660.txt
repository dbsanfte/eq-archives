I guess we are agreed on most everything then.

What I see as one of the differences between the
two, was that the British seemed to have little or
no guilt about their Empire. They just adopted an
air of superiority, and ignored any criticism. 

People were either British or foreigners , and
they still are that way for many Brits.

Americans seem surprised when other cultures make
their dislike of them known.
