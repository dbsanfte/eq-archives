Precisely.  If the guild were not a raiding guild, I could probably 
prevail upon folks to do the 10th ring, but, as it stands, I don't see 
that as being likely.  So far, I have one ring that is better, and one 
that is marginally worse than the 10th ring.  The 115hp one you spoke of 
is not wearable by casters as I recall, so not an option for me.  I do 
expect to upgrade my current ring in the not too distant future to 
something better than ring 10 anyway, so, I have not really worried about 
it that much, it's just one of those quests that I have worked on that is 
still hanging out there, and that's what bugs me.  :b
