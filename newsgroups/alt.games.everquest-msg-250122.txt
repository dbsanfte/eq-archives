I'm not sure I understand you. You have 2 attacks buttons. One if
attack with your melee weapons, and a second to attack with ranged
weapons. When you hit Ranged, you will throw or shoot what you have
currently occupied in your ranged (unless it cannot be thrown). When
the mob gets close, you have to hit your autoattack key and that will
trigger your melee weapons. No need to swap here since the bow and
melee weapons occupy different slots.
