Think positive, moriarty....  Remember, some people actually WANT more
aggro gear, like... Oh... Tanks who play the Main Assist.  There might be
even things like mana reduction or agro reducing gear that people could
use, like that over used Druid when there are no clerics, or that
overworked Shaman trying to keep the rest of you ampped up on your multiple
pulls.

Not really...  The game is not balanced if people become too stagnant in
how things are handled.  Yes...  A mob that has the ability to cast a stun
spell isn't going to just blindly sit there and try to disease your butt
while you are casting the nuke, a smart mob would think about stunning you
just as you would stun a mob trying to do a Complete Heal on itself.  This
might suggest changing tactics in a lot of things, and drop the ever
popular line of the ever changing world.

Well, the other problems that were created by pets was they suffered
pathing issues, much like NPCs when it came to manuevering them around in
some places, thus creating trains from hell that made such classes
undesirable in such situations.  The other situation was worrying about
crowd control.  Playing an Enchanter, I sometimes dread being with a mage
or having a pet up due to the way mobs that attack anything, it was almost
impossible to do crowd control because once I mezzed a mob, the pet would
wig out on the wrong mob and practically make it pointless to try.  At the
same time, trying to convince the other players to back off another mob and
work on the one the pet was wiggin on, is as much helpful as trying to
convince multiple players to stop wigging out on everything and concentrate
on the one mob.

Believe it or not...  In the cases of Enchanters, their animations are, by
far, the worse pet class out there.  You can't control them, they only agro
when you get your butt hit, and they suck HP/AC wise, even if you try and
buff the hell out of them.  I should know, I still can't solo too well with
them on blues closer to my level.  Necros have played without groups long
before that and they are fairly active, and they have to be active with
their pets to just keep them alive.  Same with Mages.  Also, as an
Enchanter, the biggest worry among groups is the feeling that the pet will
soak up the XP that the group should be getting, even though the pet could
be the greatest asset to the entire group (Like a mostly caster filled
group)  While you may think this will discourage having tanks...  From my
point of view, some areas, it is hard to FIND tanks, or other types of
classes.  When a group gets together, they are often times trying to find
other classes to round it out, and finding there is none.  This should
allow a bit more of the 'well, we can't really do this, cause we don't have
this...' feeling to go away.

You should REALLY understand what you are asking here.  Dire Charm turns a
mob into a pet...  without much of a time limit.  Also, in majority of the
cases, pets summoned by Mages, Necros and Enchanters, rarely are close to
the level of the summoner.  Furthermore, Mage Monster summoning, from what
I have seen, does not summon casting npcs or npcs that could, in essense,
frenzy like some of the mobs in some of the higher level zones.  From what
I have seen...  Even the summoned npcs tend to do damage about the same
level if not less than most buffed up, well equipped PC players.  I think
the point of this is, "Just cause you can charm one of the more uber NPCs
to do your bidding, does not mean your group gets off easily."  I mean,
seriously, If I could Dire Charm a Gnoll while I was 29...  The mob that
hits for 53 to 65 points of damage by himself and throw him against his own
kind, some of the players who could barely get that with their 2hs buffed
up the wahoo would probably be sitting back or putting in a hit or two
while letting the gnoll do all the work, and with higher levels who do get
Dire Charm...  Getting that 40 or 50th level mob that can whack out the 75
to 120 point hit and taking the brunt of all the damage is probably more
preferable than having your main assist do so and healing him a lot more,
when the dired mob has more hit points than most of the group combined.

Hey, as an enchanter, I use reclaim energy to help work up my Conjuring
skill by summoning my 1st level pet and reclaiming him.  Do you have any
idea how much of an asset it is to be able to practice conjuring is for an
Enchanter when it comes to pets and mezzing.  Trying to do that in the
field and fizzling up the wahoo, EVEN WITH INT SUPERIORITY, is almost
suicidal.

Just cause you only seen one person with a horse, doesn't mean some of the
older servers with a lot of uber, really rich players, don't have horses
themselves.
