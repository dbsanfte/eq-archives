Agreed, plus about 1 percent of the players of EQ actually bother to
come here or even post on the official message boards. Many only
bother when an issue like this price change comes up.

I don't think the problem is people leaving over this price change but
rather it being the last straw for some people on the fence. Currently
there is really no other choice for an mmorpg besides EQ since the
rest are even worse. Everyone I know who went to DAOC is back, it just
hasn't got the staying power of EQ. What this price hike will do is
make it so when real competition pops up like City of Heroes, Star
Wars Galaxies, Vaporshadowbane that people will jump ship in droves
(if the products are actually better, SWG really can't be worse
though) SWG will especially be the killer, it will probably be the
very best design and content of EQ and it will make more sense to
people to pay a new larger price for something new than a new larger
price for something 3 years old.

Its nothing to do with being able to afford it, its just the bad taste
it leaves in your mouth. People said this same leaving stuff about
competition with Daoc and AO, but both cost more per month and both
ended up being mediocre. I just keep thinking that its only a matter
of time though, then that price hike will be the final deciding factor
for many people and the final coffin for EQ. 

Its not going to be "Oh $12.95 is horrible!!", but rather its going to
be "Hmm Star wars Galaxies costs $15.95 per month and is star wars and
all shiney and new and I play it and have continual orgasms. This
$15.95 per month is not bad on its own but if I figure the $12.95 on
top of it for continuing this other game its a bit much so EQ has to
go. This is a shame because I would have possibly kept my level 60
character in EQ at $9.89 but the $3 price hike felt like such an
insult to me at this late point, like the saying goes I like to be
kissed when I'm fucked."  I doubt if everyone will sasy it just like
that (especially that last phrase) but this will be something like
they will be thinking. Its what I was thinking before the price hike
(maybe I'll keep EQ around at $9.89 though SWG will be the big thing)

So I'm thinking its more likely that a time like that will cause more
ebaying/player auctionsing, not the price hike alone. Of course when 
everyone is trying to auction their characters because SWG makes them
spunk, it will be a bit too late then. Anyone with the revenue to buy
them in EQ would also be interested in SWG instead.
