Still no graphic for them.

My half elf rogue has one....if she puts it on, weird graphical glitches
pop up...not the least has been seeing her go completely topless
(yes, COMPLETELY).

But if she casts Erudite, Iksar, Dark Elf, High Elf, or Gnome
Illusion, she becomes a white-robed gal.  And it looks almost
exactly like the Nexus Scions' robes.

I've been /bugged as a non-responsive NPC before, too...
