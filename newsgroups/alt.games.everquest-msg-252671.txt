I have searched the web and found a few things about DKP, nothing really
specific, so I thought I would ask here.

My guild is currentley considering DKP over 'morale' /randoms.

A system with no item prices would be prefereable due to the work I think is
inherent with systems which use item prices.

Zero sum would be nice also.

Can anyone point me to some working dkp systems with those and these
thoughts in mind?

Main priority is fairness, the more you do with the guild the more likely
you will win loot on raids.

Second priority is ease of maintenance, no one wants to spend 2 hours each
night doing DKP calculations.

Third priority is consideration to the more casual raider (which maybe
conflicts with the main one).

Fourth priority is speed of handing out loot.

Thanks for any links or information :)
