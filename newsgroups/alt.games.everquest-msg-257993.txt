That's an interesting question. I'd have to say it's a spectrum.  The 
traffic laws that say that if I'm the cause of an accident, I have to take 
responsibility for the consequences, no, that's not big brother, that's 
common freakin' sense.  The ones that say I would have to pay $200 for 
running a red light at 3AM when I looked, and nobody's around for 3 blocks 
except some stupid camera attached to the stoplight... that's a bit more 
big brothery.

Parking violations are, on average, just a somewhat retarded form of 
taxation.  Even speeding tickets can be seen that way, situationally...  
On freeways near me, the speed limit is 65, and the average vehicle speed 
(barring heavy traffic) is closer to 75-80.  So the guy who gets pulled 
over?  It was just his turn to pay the officer's salary and keep 'Traffic 
Safety Taught by Muppets!' in business this week.

But yeah, basically I agree, it's a very hazy line.
