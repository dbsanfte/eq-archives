Bullshit.
In case you might have misunderstood me... Bullshit.
In a depressed industry the bean counters take over and strive
desperately to reduce costs with little thought for anything else.
This means that an awful lot of the most productive people find
themselves out of work and unable to find work because their
employer shrank (or even folded) and prospective employers would
rather hire some kid for half the salary, never mind that he'll
not come close to being half as productive for years.  This is,
of course, if the prospective employer is hiring at all rather
than planning their own layoffs.  It has nothing to do with the
competence of the technical people and everything to do with
market conditions and the ill-informed guesswork of desperate
executives doing everything they can to stop the ship from
sinking before their howling shareholders dump them out in the
cold with the employees they've just terminated.
