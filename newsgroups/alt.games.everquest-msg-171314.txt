i was farming/hunting Hill Giants the other dat in Rathe and saw the blue
dude zoom by me with three of them on him. i thought it was a glitch with my
video... this little blue dude zipped by my in , oh maybe 2 frames, then the
giants followed, much later...

i followed them all in an effort to help a bit, i think he was more
interested in the corrupt giant so i nailed one of the normal HG's. i watch
him as he aipped around... even in wolf form i don't even come close to his
speed...

so what spell did he have or what might he ave been wearing that makes his
movement rate so freakin fast ?
