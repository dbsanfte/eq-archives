I just started my halfling ranger on the test server and I have a few
things, nothing special though.  But I was just looking online at the Pine
Scout Equipment that you can get from the quests in JaggedPine.  That
stuff is great for being obtainable at level 5.  The only problem is that
it does not appear that it is available to halflings.  My question is
though.  Is this accurate?  If so, does anyone know of any comparable
armor available at the level to halflings?
