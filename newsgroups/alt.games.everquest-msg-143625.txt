And everybody knows that "the whole exp per unit time thingy" is
absolutely the be-all/end-all of EQ.  This is especially true when
the lost med time equals approximately 0.002% of your total.
I was always left with the distinct impression that the casters
liked things this way since it required no thought, little effort,
and no quasi-courteous bitching on their part.

You grouped with people who didn't give pages/words/runes to the
appropriate caster automaticly?  Good grief, even pickup groups
in LOIO used to do this when I hung out there with my warrior.
