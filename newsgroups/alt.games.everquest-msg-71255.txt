Hi all.  I play Asheron's Call currently, but I am thinking of switching to
a new online RPG.  Can any of you who might have experience tell me the
differences and similarites between the two games?

Also, can anyone tell me (without bias please) about the game of EQ?  Is it
fun?  Generally, how is gameplay compared to the other online RPGs.

I have experience in AC and UO, so references to the 2 games I can
understand.  Thanks in advance!
