I want to make a note to all looking for the flying monky camp.  This
seems to be a lower lvl camp and all, but getting to it will be a
dragon named woushi, do not follow the wall to the left from kael
unless you want to spend most of your day getting your corpse back.
shoot straight up the middle of the zone for about 45 to 60 secs via
running with sow then ver to the left.  note there are cougars, forget
their named that cast invis onthemselves and will sneak up on you, be
sure you have see invis and that you are invisible when going here for
your lvl 39 spells.
