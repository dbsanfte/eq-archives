Many druids who are hunting regularly drop sow/soe for wolf form.

ANY druid who has SOE up most of the time has to forget SOE, mem sow, cast
sow, forget sow, and mem SOE it any time they decide to give of themselves
to a player who is under level 42.

My 57 enchanter has the same inconvenience with people who ask for clarity.

But regardless, anyone who thinks that a druid should cast sow on someone
JUST BECAUSE they ask politely is damned rude.  Personally, I'll SoW polite
requesters unless they're at a druid ring or EC tunnel, but I absolutely
refuse to give up my right to deny them my time and mana without being
called rude.
