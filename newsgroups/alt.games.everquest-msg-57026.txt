  Not all necromancers worship Innoruuk.  It's true that not all druids
worship Tunare, but it's not exactly outlandish that a druid guild that is
really in to Tunare worship might be influenced by poor faction with Tunare.

  It does seem as if something fishy might be going on here, though.  I have
no problem with characters getting faction hits with various guilds for
going on plane raids, but there shouldn't be "stealth" faction hits if that
is indeed what is occuring here.

  Sure there is: common sense.  Also, it's a new zone, and precedents that
were set in old zones should not be automatically presumed to apply to all
modern zones.
