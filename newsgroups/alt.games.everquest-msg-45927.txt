So?  If the LD behaviour were an approximation of what a normal player
would be doing anyway, then it doesn't matter if it is a real LD or
you turned off your system.  It only matters if there is some
advantage to LD.

Here are some things they could do that would greatly improve things
for people who go LD without opening any serious exploits.

1. If you go LD and are group leader, group leadership should change
to someone else.  (They should also do this if the group leader is not
LD but has been idle for 15 minutes if not under /afk.  I've watched
someone fall asleep(!) in a place with hostile mobs, and then their
party had to stay for several hours protecting them until they woke
up.  The sleeping person was group leader, so they couldn't invite a
wizard or druid in and port out).

2. If you go LD and someone casts a translocate on you, you do not
have to confirm it.

3. If you are LD and get attacked, you should automatically defend
yourself. (Currently, if you are fighting, you keep fighting, but if
you are not fighting and get attacked, you don't do anything).

4. If you die while LD, when you log back in you should be given the
/loc of your corpse.
