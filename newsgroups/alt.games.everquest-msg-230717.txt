I had the most fun I've had for years in EQ by getting my 56 druid to thorn
up, and just run about the floors in HHK, gathering goblins, then wedging
himself in a corner and chain healing himself ; my cleric then runs up and
casts PBAE as many times as mana/interrupts allow!

 He's now 32 and we had to move on (it's hard to find that zone free, and it
gets lame fast that people ignore "camp check", and camp rooms in absentia
(plaguebones are another good powerlevelling beast; little lag in zone, and
there are no adds, and the mobs don't run). It's a good memory to hold onto
though.
