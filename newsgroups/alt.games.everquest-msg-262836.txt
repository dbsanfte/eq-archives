Um... if I get invited to a group, it's as a tank.   Ben's delusions not
withstanding, I have still never had my warrior invited to a group to fill a
DPS slot.

There are no higher level warriors.  And I'm not talking about insane mobs.
As I said before, if it was for something like Vxed / Tpit trials, I
wouldn't really mind.   But this isn't. This is for invites to your average
run of the mill exp group, in places like Wall of Slaughter or Plane of
Earth / Fire.

I don't know, perhaps this kind of discrimination has always existed, only
it's done by guildtags on most servers.   People only invite uberguild
warriors who are looking for group, because they know it's a certain level
of tank that they'll be getting.    Perhaps needing to ask to determine
equipment level is just an E'ci phenomenon, since the most advanced group on
the server is a public raiding force, made up of 50+ smaller guilds and a
fair amount of completely unguilded people.  Not a single guild.   So if you
invite someone without a guildtag, it could be anyone from a 14k warrior who
raids Qvic all the time, to a 6k fresh out of BoT warrior.
