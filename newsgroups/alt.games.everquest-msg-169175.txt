I had a similar thing happen with my Barbarian Warrior.  I was in Oasis in
/roleplay mode waiting on the docks.  Someone walks up to me and _TELLS_
me to give them a SoW.  I go one to explain (in roleplay mode) that "Me no
have the majiks." (I roleplay my guy really dumb as, well, he is)  He goes
on to yell at me saying that he KNOWS I am a shaman and that I should stop
my "gay-ass" roleplaying and give him a SoW.  I nicely explain that "Me a
wareer, seez the swords?".  Somehow he still did not believe me, and
proceeded to berate be further, shouting to the zone that I am an asshole
and that I refused to SoW him for some reason blah blah blah.  Most of the
people there told him to shut up and that he was wrong, "he is dual
wielding swords you moron" they would say, and then he realized he was
wrong.  A few minutes later I get a tell from him apologizing for thinking
that I was a Shaman, but that us "stupid" roleplayers were making the game
harder for those that are not because they cannot tell what class we are.

<sigh>
