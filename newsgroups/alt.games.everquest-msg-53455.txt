Thats why I've become cold and bitter towards beggars. however, I
still feel sorry for level 1 casters and will give them a couple plats
to buy first spells, as I know how it is.  But I'll never ever give

I have been know to randomly give out some junk items that I pick up
along the way.  Sheer bone mask, tower guard blade, etc
