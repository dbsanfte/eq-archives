Sad smile.  Bear in mind a great number of EQ players weren't born when this
fateful trip was made.  (My age is showing here...)
The Challenger's brief space flight / disaster was 17 years ago, it seems like
last year to me.  Christa McAuliffe was my hero.  She's *still* one of my
heroes.  Our triumphs in space are not without tragedy.  
My thoughts are with the families of our astronauts, and those of Ilan Roman,
the Israeli astronaut who joined them for their short adventure.   Yes, they
were doing something they loved.  No doubt.  It wasn't a job - it WAS an
adventure.  No better way to go, than to go doing something you love.
But it does not dampen the hurt or sorrow of their loved ones.
Words of advice:  NOTHING is quite comparable than the stress people feel over
death.  Just say "I'm sorry for your loss, I'm there for you if you need me." 
It may sound lame, but it's consoling, and simple.  Sometimes thats the best
way to go.
