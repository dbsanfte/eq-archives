Sony/Verant have improved the game a few months ago so that one
needn't pull up a book to improve one's mana regneration.   Just
sitting will do the trick now.   The same for healing, though whipping
out those bandanges is a tad faster.

There are rumours that if one is intoxicated that one's mana
regeneration is faster.  This is disputed by most people and some
reckon that, really, mana regeneration when drunk ought to stop.  But
this is another thread for another time.
