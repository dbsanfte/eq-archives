First shot - standing normal
Second shot - on horseback, without having moved an inch
Third shot - what your groupmates will see ;)

If you have the money for it, I highly recommend a horse.  As a cleric you
spend a lot of time on your butt, which just ups your already-high agro, and
horses are *wonderful* because you med constantly with no sitting agro.
You'll be primarily targeting your groupmates, but even if you're casting
just /assist.  I ditch mine 50% of the time when I go into mezzing mode
(mine is on my Enchanter), but it's fine elsewise.  It's the most expensive
thing I've ever bought in-game, but I don't regret a copper.  Better have
someone else master loot though; they're a bitch to loot from.
