In normal exp groups, MAYBE in some zones.

I know that I have guildies with AthlonXP 1900+, 1GB of RAM, GeForce3
and RAID 0 Cheetahs who do not run with all models on during raids
because the game lags too much for them.

50 Luclin model + AoEing mobs + traditionally laggy zones ==
Forgettaboutit.

My "main" machine (1.4Ghz, 1GB RAM, GeForce3) which I use during raids
is set with all Luclin models turned off.

My secondary machine which I only use for my twinkies and non-raid
groups, I have the "default" Luclin models turned on (the
configuartion which turns on all models except for the shorties).

The secondary machine is comparable to the first in configuration.
The difference in performance when I get both characters in the same
zone is VERY noticable.
