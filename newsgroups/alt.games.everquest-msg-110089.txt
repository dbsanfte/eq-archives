Yeah, that kind of bugs me too. It seems pretty likely that we won't
be able to move our characters over, and I'm not sure how keen I am on
starting from scratch.

On the other hand, everyone would be starting from scratch, and there
is a certain appeal to that.

Nor do I. The EQ2 announcement, though, has convinced me to hold off
on buying a new video card. My GeForce2 can limp along another year or
two, and hopefully by the time EQ2 is released, there will be cards
far superior to the GeForce3 minimum they're currently stating.

I suspect that a lot of the design of EQ is so horribly out of date as
to make this almost impossible. Verant / SOE has learned a *lot* about
MMORPG games, so I can understand why they would want to start over
with fresh ideas. But it really seems a shame to essentially throw
away all the existing content.

>As for me, I will continue to play EQ1 and hope for the best.

For the next year or two, so will I :)

(Damn glad I didn't just buy a two-year subscription to EQ1 though!)
