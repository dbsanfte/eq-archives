    Short answer: yes.

    Long answer: clerics are usually stuck in med mode because of the
demands placed on their mana. You've likely been in those groups where if
the cleric has a lot of mana, people start pulling faster. A good puller
will start pulling just fast enough that you can barely keep up. And that
means a lot of ass time.

    Will you do other things? From time to time, yes. Some places you'll go,
the puller won't be able to find enough to keep you sitting and you'll be
able to do other things. Other places will demand that you help with what
few utility spells you have, like stuns, nukes, roots or fears. You'll be
asked to exercise your judgement as to what you can do and still have enough
mana to heal when it's required. Good judgement and fast reaction time are
the two most important assets for a cleric to posess, in my opinion. I also
think a good cleric must be upbeat and have a good sense of humour - you act
as the morale officer of a party in a way, keeping spirits high (since you
have the most time to type).

    Personally, I think these challenges are more than sufficient to provide
for exciting, fun gameplay. But I'm also an accountant (comptroller to be
exact). Other people don't get satisfaction unless they see themselves
actively killing the monsters. You'll need to figure out for yourself if you
can handle not being the big badass that lays low all she sees. But I will
take one jab at those people: a lot of the fighting types like big numbers,
the bigger the better. "I backstabbed for double 400s!" "I Cleansed for
5000!" "I got a crit manaburn for 19000!" I have yet to hear of any other
class that can get a crit for 21420 - that's me critting a Complete Heal. If
you want to get the biggest number in the end, there it is. ;-)

> Annie <--- Knows not to specialize in Evocation.

    Yeah, alteration all the way. At max specialization you'll be saving
roughly 11% on your spell costs, while the other areas will only be saving
3% once your specialization caps at 50. There are clerics that do specialize
in Evocation and solo their way up, but it's slow and lonely and once you
hit high level you have to do that silly Temple of Solusek Ro quest to reset
your specialization.
