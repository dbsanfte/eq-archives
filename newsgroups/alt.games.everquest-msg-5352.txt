Well, everyone said this was the place to be, so my Troll SK decided to
leave Oasis and make the trip.  Took the uneventful boat ride (fun for the
first time, boring thereafter)... and landed in Overthere.  Got a bind from
a 50+ spellcaster and he was nice enough to give me a buff I had never heard
of called "Dead Man Walking", which among other things allowed me to
levitate.

As I was going to War Woods, I was having fun with my levitation and
accidently stepped off the cliff in the middle of OT into the Scorpikas (sp)
temple.  No problem I thought, I'll just levitate out.  Well having never
been levitated, I slowly floated to the gorge's floor, but couldn't get out.
Then I saw these huge scorpian/Iksars creatures which almost made me wet my
pants.  To my incredible luck they were indiff and I could walk amongst them
(A CR in here would have been impossible).  I wandered around until I found
the exit.  Of course the 2 scorps by the exit were not indiff and promptly
crushed me.

Got my corpse back without event and made it to War Woods.  My goal was to
go to Lake via the tunnels.  Little did I know what was in the tunnels.
Made it to the tunnels and got chased by a ton of Iksar outcasts, but I
finally made the zone to lake.  Just my luck I am in another set of tunnels.
Quick /ooc only to find out I'm in the goblin tunnels (funny my map didn't
indicate this).  I figure I'll give it a shot, but first gob I see is red.
Don't want to die here, so I go back to War Woods.

SOW is blinking (oh no!!!!).  Worst feeling in the world I tell you.  I run
very fast thru Iksar tunnels with a few on my butt.  Make it out and lose
SOW, but nothing is chasing me (phew).

Back to OT and decide to go the Frontier Mts. route. with a friend who
happened to be in the zone.  We run very very very fast and manage to make
it to the Lake (YES!!!!)

Hey, this was much more fun than hunting crocs in Oasis hehe
