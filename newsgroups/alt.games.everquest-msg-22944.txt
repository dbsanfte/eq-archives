 I'm not saying it doesn't suck but I'm fairly sure this was mentioned
in the patch message when this change took place. It should also be in
the supplement manual file. 

 I don't have all the patch messages so I can't check. I also don't have
the manual supplement nearby either. If it's wasn't mentioned in both of
those places then I'd say Verant dropped the ball.
