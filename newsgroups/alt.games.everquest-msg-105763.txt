This group has tremendous resorces of knowledge I have learned
much and answered much in the 3 years I have been reading this group.
However, the regulars here do not suffer fools lightly and will not hesitate
to let anyone (newbies are not spared) that trolls and morons wont be
tolerated.

Well it seems you know about usenet and its many forms of behavior
then why get your feathers ruffled at this? Methinks your righteous
indignation is a little too transparent.

Quote of the day: "Arguing with someone on Usenet is like running
in a race in the Special Olympics, Even if you win you are STILL
a retard."
