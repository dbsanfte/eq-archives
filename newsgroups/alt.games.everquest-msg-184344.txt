Since the version recently put on test killed EQW for me (probably
just an accident on their part, don't panic) I had a chance to try out
playing two windows of EQ on one computer at the same time using the
in game version (alt enter) instead. Here's a comparison, and for
clarity's sake the computer I am doing this is quite low end:
basically if I can be doing it anyone can be:

What EQW does better: 

1. Switching fast. I have to hit alt-enter, alt-tab, alt enter to
actually switch between two characters using EQ default mode. That
takes a couple seconds, but in an emergency that could be too much.
EQW is a simple alt-tab.

2. Default switching strangeness. Somehow when switching the character
I switched from has had attack turned off or their target changed
while I am on the other character. I'm not sure how that happened, and
it wasn't consistent, but it was worrying.

What default switching does better:

1. Load times. It takes me eight minutes or so to load up the second
account when using EQW. Not fatal but really annoying. There's no real
slowdown with defaut switching.

2. Zoning. Like loading, zoning is slower using EQW.

3. Framerate. Sometimes there's some stuttering framerate problems
when using EQW, they didn't appear to be there when default switching.


This jive with what other people have found?
