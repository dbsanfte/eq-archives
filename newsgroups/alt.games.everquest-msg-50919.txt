No, I think you're too stupid to see what I was really saying:
EVERYONE who waltzes into this newsgroup and starts telling us how the
game should be has been "Playing since Beta" or "playing since just
after Beta" and claims to have several high level characters. *shrug*
This is the same assanine idiot who was saying the "majority" of
players think EQ should give us more than 8 spell slots. Anyone who's
been "playing since just after Beta" or even more than a few months
and has halfway followed any discussion on the topic knows that's a
load of bullshit. A few speak out supporting more slots when the
subject comes up, but FAR more say it's fine as it is and adding even
one more would throw off balance...

Far's I'm concerned, he's blowing smoke by parading his "experience".
I could easily tell you that I've been playing since Beta, and you'd
have know way to prove or disprove the statement. I could tell you I
have 4 lvl 60 characters with the same result. I'm going by how he
presents himself with what he's said... He presents himself as a
know-it-all newbie who thinks his opinion is the only right one and
should be idolized as the "one true way" EQ should be...
