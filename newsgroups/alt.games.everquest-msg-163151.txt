Hi all

I looted a Staff of the Dreaded Gaze off Xalgoz the other night.
I checked allakhazams and such, and it seems to be a fairly desireable item
for the ultimate doers of evil, but when I asked some of my guild's necros,
they said it wasnt that great at all.

Does anyone know anything about this item, such as how useful it is to
necros, what level it can be used at, rough PC etc?

Thanks in advance.
