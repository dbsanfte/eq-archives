I completely agree with number one. Regarding number two, I would be
perfectly fine dungeon crawling, where everyone performed their roles.
That would be fun and interesting. What we were doing could not be
construed as "crawling" by any stretch of the imagination. It was
haphazardly flying through the zone with no collective purpose. It
drove me nuts, so I bailed.

I *will* say that giving up the +2 AGI earring was well worth it for
the name of a player with whom I'll know not to group in the future.
