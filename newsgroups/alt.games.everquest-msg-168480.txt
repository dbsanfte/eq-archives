They stand more to lose than you do.  IMHO, the trust should be on your
shoulders.  If someone doesn't pay afterwards, you are out some mana and
about 30 seconds of your time.  If you port and leave them behind, they are
lose platinum, which is harder to replace than mana.

I've tried it your way (negotiation and demanding payment up front).  I
found out a long time ago that I make a hell of alot more plat by being
trusting and accepting donations whenever the person decides to.  The amount
lost by those that take off without payment is insignificant compared to
what I make by simply trusting the person to make a reasonable donation.

There's just too many porters out there offering their services for
donations.  Most people needing a port don't have to haggle over the price
or deal with someone demanding up front payment unless they are desparate
for a ride.
