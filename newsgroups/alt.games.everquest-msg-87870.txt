Oh My Max Power (name for a person with major ego issues, must feel and be
small and effiminate in order to have such a macho name.) is a born IDIOT.
I wonder if his family had any children that lived?

If I were his family I would lock him in the basement and kept on lithium
and thorizine to prevent him from embarrasing the whole family ever again in
public.

Ok, Maxie to register you NEED A CREDIT CARD!!
It is very simple, maybe too simple for someone such as your self.

So go back to playing or even being ms. pacman and leave the adults (or what
passes for mostly mature players here) alone

Btw, Yeah I'm fat but I have a life, a wife and my own home. What do you
have except a your room in your Mama's house and flicking boogers on the
ceiling trying to make a sculpture?
