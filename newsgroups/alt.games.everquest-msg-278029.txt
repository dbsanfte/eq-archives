My main is a level 60 ranger. When I started out, I didn't get in a
guild until I was over level 30. Other than just to check things out,
I rarely left Qeynos/Qeynos Hills/The Karanas until about that level.
I didn't even go into the bazaar until I was in my 20's and even then
it was just to buy a weapon. I did all of the newbie armor quests and 
wore that *forever*. I joined my guild in my early 30's and started 
learning about things like tradeskills and started doing them. I
ended up getting my pottery and brewing skills up high enough that
I could make prismatic dyes to sell in the bazaar. Started selling
those and researching other tradeskill items that would sell. I
worked on fletching to get it up high enough to make elemental bows
and started selling them.

I had over 100K in the bank before I started upgrading my armor in
any significant way. And I did it slowly. I also spent long hours
doing quests for some of the things that I wear. All of the time,
I would hear and watch people spending 10K here and 20K there and
then listen to them complain because they never had any money and
they'd ask how I was able to have a bankroll. Of course, they didn't
want to hear that I had spent 6 months farming acrylia to get my
fletching up high enough to make elemental bows. Or the 3 or 4
hours a week doing the combines for the dyes to sell in the bazaar.
Or the five or six levels that my druid spent in Stonebrunt levelling
because she could also forage bamboo shoots while there. Or that
I believe that spending 20K on an item that gives me a one or two
point upgrade in a stat isn't worth it. They want to know how they
can make 100K *today* and that I don't know how to do. :P
