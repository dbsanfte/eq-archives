Hunt mammoths in everfrost.  There are usually people there hunting them
as well so getting a group should not be that hard.  The tusks they drop
sell for a few pp at vendors.  If you head out to the towers there are
usually tons of them out there.  If you get a full good group you could
also do icy orcs.  Plus its your home turf :)
