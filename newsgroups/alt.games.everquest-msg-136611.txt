I got a golden black sapphire earring for 25pp poor guy forgot to add a 0 he
was afk... I sent him a tell and had to log half hour later.I bet he was mad
when he realized it. I bought a ring of frost spiders for 50pp I sold a
Lodizal Shield and was able to twink my mage with some "phat lewts"
I like the bazaar it's much easier than ec... It does have some flaws as
with all things but I really think verant got one right or at least the
beginnings of getting something right.
