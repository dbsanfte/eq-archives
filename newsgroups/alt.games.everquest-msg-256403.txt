To give you a few alternatives:

The Great Old One. If you've played it before, it's familier, but a 
different experience today. A lot of commands feel very Mud like. Most 
Mudders relate well to this world. You can get a free 30 day trial in 
the basic world right now iirc. You can buy the game and all expansions 
for like $40.

The best of the more Player verses Player'ish games. Main part is PvE, 
but endgame is PvP.
Has a 7 day free trial available for download through fileplanet. Don't 
know how much the full game runs.

Blocky graphics, but the game goes on and on and on. Good storyline was 
going last I looked at it (updates monthly).  As I understand, it's 
cheap to get into atm (~$15 for a downloaded version)
Everyone I know that played AC2, the sequel, say it absolutly sucked.

Final Fantasy meets the online world. Interface sucks. Graphics purty. 
Auto Translator (sorta, actually a phrase book type thingie) for mixing 
with the Japanese players. You can't hardly sneeze without knocking a 
cat girl down.
If you might like something non-fantasy:

Lots of character customization, spandex clad cartoon heros.
Many oldtimers have felt this a refreshing, if somewhat shallow from the 
gameplay department, change of pace from the grind state of mind of most 
of the other games.
The last two you have to get off the shelf for around $50 atm I'm 
afraid. FF comes with an expansion bundled, and has another coming 
within a couple of months.

All of these have the advantage over WoW and EQ 2 of being actually 
available to purchase, and also mature enough to have a lot of the 
glaring problems taken care of. None of them are perfect, but they're 
good. CoH is much younger than the others, but benefits from it's 
somewhat shallow model (not a take down, just a fact). Its gameplay is 
simpler, therefore its problems are in general going to be simpler to 
deal with. I will leave a discussion of their relative merits to others 
(though mention I lost interest in CoH in 3 hours, couldn't stand AC, 
felt DAoC was just a clone of EQ that 'fixed' things that didn't need 
fixing, and broke things that didn't need breaking, played EQ for 3-4 
years, and given my offline game preferences, couldn't have not played 
Final Fantasy under any circumstances.
Currently playing FF, and having a good time.

Unfortunatly, you've missed EQ2's and WoW's beta signup periods, so you 
will likely have to wait (or get a friend in beta) to get into the game 
until release.
