After an extremely frustrating few days playing a human shadowknight
based in and around Freeport -- a certain gnome NPC is apparently
HUNTING ME through North Freeport and killing me almost instantly --
I've decided to go the easy route with my second character and pick a
race/class combo that fits in with its home base better.

Some thoughts are:

* A gnome wizard staying close to home and working on
tinkering/fishing/swimming while I explore the nearby mines;
* A halfling warrior staying close to home;
* A half-elf bard based in Freeport (if possible);
* A wood elf ranger;
* A dark-elf shadowknight.

Not that I need things to be a walk in the park, but are any of these
destined to be more fun to play than the others? Anything I should know
about any of the above choices?

And at what level does travelling between cities become a viable
option? A cleric and I -- both just under fifth level -- tried to go
from Freeport to Rivervale, but ended up getting beaten with a stick
repeatedly in the forests west of Freeport, which I'd naively hoped
would border on Rivervale's newbie zone and thus not be super-deadly. A
few lions, bears and griffons -- along with sightings of BIG spiders --
proved otherwise.

And what's that big mountain west of Freeport with the tunnels through
it? Is there a dungeon in there, or is it just a freaky old ruin with
some evil traders?

Thanks.
