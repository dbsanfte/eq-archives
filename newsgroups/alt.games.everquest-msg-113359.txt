Ahh, but if he doesn't know who the Player is, how can he like him more.

Slight reword :

An NPC hears footsteps approach, but sees no one.  Several items float out
of nowhere and are placed in the NPC's hand. The NPC responds, "I know not
who you are, unseen stranger, but I thank you for bringing me the items I
have longed sought after."  Then the figure removes his invisiblity,and loe
it is an enemy.  Torn by the desire to slaughter his enemy and his
thankfulness for the gift, the NPC considers that he may have misjudged this
one.  Perhaps.
