OK, here's what I know about coffins:

The level 12 spell uses Black Ceremonial Coffins. They are giant items, can
fint in a container, cost ~2.5pp and can be found on any starting city's bag
merchant. Also found in ShadowHaven and POK.

The level 39 Summon Corpse spell is hunted in the depths of Split Paw. EQ
Atlas has reasonable directions, but there are better descriptions out
there. This uses the container coffins called Jade Inlaid coffins, and are
closer to 200pp in cost. You can buy these in POK, Plane of Sky (old Air),
Neriak, Paineel and the Bazaar. That's it. This spell does not affect
corpses over level 60.

The level 58 Conjure Corpse spell does not drop off specific mobs, but is
common enough in Sebilis. If you can't get in a group that is lucky enough
to have it drop, it's cheap in Bazaar. If you are lucky, you can get a robe
(like I do) with the right click mana-free effect of Conjure Corpse- and
yes, it still costs the component. These robes are the Velious quest robes
(thurg, Kael and SS) and Plane of Growth robe. The coffins this spell uses
is Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin found on all the same merchants that sell the
other Jade Inlaid Coffine. The major benefit is they cost ~80pp and are
stackable and fit in tiny containers.

Hope this helps.
