But answering your point, it IS all about loot, not combat...that's why I
couldn't think what the middle "C" stood for.  I mean, EQ has ALWAYS had
TCC...you kill a critter too far below you, you get no xp.  But since it is
ALL about loot I think calling it "TCC" is kinda silly (though "TLC" isn't
all that hot, either <g> (translation for the non-English visitors, "TLC" is
most known as an abbreviation for Tender Loving Care).
