Excellent observation.  Though I hadn't noticed this myself with EQ, this is
about the 3rd program I've seen to do this in the last 5 or 6 years.  The
last one that did this trashed MANY pictures I had taken at my son's 4th
birthday party, never to be recovered again.  Those of you who are parents
will know how awful that could be (many sweet little smiles lost forever).
I keep my /temp folder on a whole different partition as a result.  No, you
SHOULD NOT have to do this, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

Sean...
