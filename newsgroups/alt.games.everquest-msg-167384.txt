jaZZ md,

Right, I seem to be the one who can't post to the group without bizbee
stalking *me*.  Not the other way around.   Every time I try and post
anything at all bizbee comes out of the woodwork and attacks me.

Then a few people, like yourself, start fanning the flames...  I'm a
stalker?  WTF, is wrong with you? All I did was try and post on topic
and here comes bizbee on the attack.  He hardly even posts to the
group anymore, except to attack people, or haven't you noticed?

Get a clue and give me a break.
