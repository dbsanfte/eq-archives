Thats very true, but I think the exception may very well be Tailoring.  The
problem with Tailoring is that you have to gather the materials your self,
you just can't buy 10,000 of some item and combine them until your a master
of what ever.  This means spending hundreds of hours getting to a level that
you can make the nicer items.  While eventually there will be more 200+
Tailors, the barriers of entry on this skill are high enough to ensure that
the market isn't completely flooded.  Although I suspect the days of 10K
tailored items will end.
