They really don't care about that kind of stuff, unless you start rubbing
their noses in it.  CS resources are stretched far enough as it is, going

"If a group of children are already playing and a child arrives later and
wishes to join them, there are differences in the ways popular and unpopular
children gain entry to the group.  The popular child seeks entry and then
adapts his or her behavior to the group flow; the child who is likely to be
rejected barges in and imposes him or herself on the other children, with
little regard for what the others are already doing."
