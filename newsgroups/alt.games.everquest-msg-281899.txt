First EQ, now EQ2. Neither game can manage gamma levels. In EQ, any time I 
go from windowed to full-screen mode or vice versa, the gamma setting drops 
to the point where I can barely see. All I have to do it nudge the gamma 
slider a little and back, and it corrects itself.

Now in EQ2, I thought I'd adjust the size of the letterbox and as soon as I 
do, there goes the gamma levels.

This has been this way through a couple of different graphics cards on my 
part (though both were ATI). I've /bug'ed it several times. I just don't 
understand why they can't figure this one out.
