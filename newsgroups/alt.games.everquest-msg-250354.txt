I saw a discovery science channel program on that and other items
from the 1950s. They couldn't get approval for thousands of
free-flying aircars. But they could get it for the autopilot bit.

Ah. No, not a complaint. I was trying to figure out how to do it

Nah, only one caffeine drink per day. My acid reflux and my doctor
prefer it that way. I do 12 hour shifts of computer tech support for
other employees... some of whom apparently do not know what that
thing called electricty might be.
