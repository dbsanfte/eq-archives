My recommendation: Dark Elf Enchanter, agnostic. I've never really wanted
anything that had 'innoruuk' on it, except maybe the imbued enchanted teir
dal chain, and I imagine you won't bother with anything like that.
Gear: HP, HP, Focus, and did I mention HP?
If you are going to be charming pick up some cheap CHR gear, you can get 100
points of charisma easy.
There are some quite cheap int items, you may want to pick them up, but
don't work to hard. As you have said, it's not the size of the mana pool,
it's the flow of mana through it.
