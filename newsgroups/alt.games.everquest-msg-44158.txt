    Due to something of a fluke, my cleric obtained a set of Corroded Plate
Greaves, needed for the cleric velium armor quest in Thurgadin.  My cleric
is currently 36th level. I've done the faction work necessary (gotten to
kindly) and Loremaster Dorinan well give my cleric the quest.  I don't have
the gems, but a friend has a set in the bank he's willing to give me.  The
question is, can I do this quest at my level?  Some people I play with seem
to be of the opinion that this quest can't be completed before level 50, or
at least 45.  (I believe the Word of Health effect on the greaves won't proc
till level 45.)

    It seems logical to assume that if the NPC will tell me about the quest,
I ought to be able to complete it.  Still, I don't want to risk it if
there's a big chance it won't work.  I'm probably going to petition to have
a GM standing by when I attempt it (advice from other friends).  Still, I
wondered: has anyone else here done any of the Thurgadin armor quests at a
similar level or lower?  It would be nice to know for sure that it's been
done.

    Thanks for any helpful replies.
