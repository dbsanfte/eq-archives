Its all variable, to a certain degree. I have a 65 warrior. I usually get
groups because I can hold reliable agro, and deal out a good amount of
damage while taking a good deal as well. I have great agro weapons, max
taunt :P, and anger2 on both my weapons. Some nights the RNG hates me and no
matter what I do, I get no taunt. Its few and far between, but it happens to
the best of us. Thats why the whole issue is before us.
