Man I wish people wouldnt put quotes first.  And its especially bad if
the quotes are lengthy.  Cause, frankly, I havent read half the
responses.

All this talk about SWG.  Sorry guys, no new ground invented there.
SWG is really wonderful in many ways, but...  you will not enjoy
combat or casting (shooting stuff).  Neither are part of the SWG
paradigm.

SWG is sort of amorphous.  You spread into your world.  You take on
skills as your id suggests.  And you sort of enjoy the result.

Regarding EQ2, I have a horrible suspicion it will go the way of SWG. 
There are techniques now for random everything.  And that means a huge
decrease in developers time.  We see that with SWG;  EQ2 will be the
same.  Random mobs, random terrain, random quests.  The EQ2 devs have
been careful to say, EQ2 is not an advance for EQ, it is an
alternative. Hopefully people are listening. Because what you will get
is the random number generator in spades.
