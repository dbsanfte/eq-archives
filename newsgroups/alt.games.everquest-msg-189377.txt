Background:
-----------
I started playing EQ again sometime in October and had the problem with my 
LinkSys 4-port router that everyone else who flashed theirs had.  I had 3 
machines hanging off the device.  I used the triggering technique to get past 
the problem and all was good.

Sometime in January ( I think ), immediately after an EQ patch, I started going 
LD about once an hour or once every 2 hours.  This happened whether I was 
running one account on that machine or both accounts on that machine.  I dealt 
with it for a few days, hoping for another patch, but none came.  I flashed the 
router to the December ( most current, even now ) BIOS, but that didn't help.

I had a friend who needed a router, so I gave him my 4-port and bought an 8-
port ( LinkSys again ).  It has the December BIOS on it and I have the same 
exact problem when using it - random disconnects, sometimes 1 or 2 a night, 
sometimes 6 or more times in 4 hours.

If I don't use the router and have my PC connected to the cable modem, I have 
no problems at all - I never disconnect.  If I put the router back into the 
equation, the disconnects start again.  Cycling the power on the router 
immediately fixes the problem... until the next disconnect.  When I get 
disconnected, it's permanent until I cycle the LinkSys.

I have tried port the port triggering approach that fixed the 15-20 minute 
disconnects back in October and that doesn't help.  I have made my machine a 
DMZ, and that doesn't help.

I just started playing my second account on another PC, so I'm going to do some 
more testing to narrow the source of the problem down some, but until I get it 
nailed down, I'm looking for any solution(s) you guys may have.  I'm going to 
take all the other machines off of the network and just play on the #2 machine 
to make sure it isn't a specific machine that is possibly taking the router 
down, among other tests.  A friend has a NetGear that I'm going to borrow to 
see if that helps.  Buying another router at this point is the last thing I 
want to do unless I have to.  I do not want to use ICS ( or a non-Microsoft 
masquerading product ), but probably will before I buy a new router.  I may 
even slap together some parts into a basic Linux box to do the masquerading for 
me if it doesn't take my wife faction down any lower...

Questions:
----------
Is anyone else getting a lot of LDs with a LinkSys still?  I can't find 
anything on Google or on Sony's boards that address this issue; I only find 
info for the issue from last year.  Does anyone have an old BIOS for the 4-port 
or 8-port LinkSys?  I don't mind downgrading my BIOS to one that was before the 
original disconnect problem.
