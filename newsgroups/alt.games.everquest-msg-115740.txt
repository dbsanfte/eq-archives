Damn I'm good, in a side post I guessed fungi tunic (he might mean iksar bp,
but it's close enough, not something that a normal L30 is going to have),
trak tooth/bloodpoint/locustlure in main hand, was going to add probably a
lot of Mrylokars, but I'm not too good with rogue armors so left it out at
risk of being wrong
