That is correct, sir!  3rd ( and last ) of my Controllers.  I ended up
teaming up with an EQ friend and doing a few missions of mine and one of
hers.  Controller and Defender do rather well together.

Made the tough call at level 6 of not getting hover and going with . . . um.
. . deceive or something.  Whatever the Mind Control charm is.

I have yet to look at any web pages or fan sites on this game, yet, and am
having a lot of fun learning as I go.  I haven't even made another class -
I've only made controllers.

Someone should make a quick list of people ( well, their chars ) that are
playing on Protector and putting them all in one post.
