My Character, a 37 Barbarian Warrior:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=470347

I am going to try and get a Liutenants Helm for my head and either a
Cougarskin Mask or a Validus Custodus Plate Visor or my face.  I try to
keep my dex at 125, because as I understand it, you get more crits that
way, which is really nice with the wurmy (though if I am mistaken, please
set me straight, and/or if it really is not worth it, let me know as well
:)  The only thing I probably wont change (for now at least) is my FBSS,
that extra haste is pretty nice.

Anything glaring? Hints? Suggestions? Thoughts?

Thanks in advance.
