I lived it.  Your experiences may differ, but in mine, it does teach the
innocent nothing.

I guess I am not military material, although I did get more than my share of
decorations during my time.  I remember, some time into my stint in the
front leaning rest position with my fellow soldiers, thinking, "Fuck you,
Major soandso.  You are going to punish me for the deeds of people I do not
know, so why in hell should I try to do right.  I'll be punished either
way."  And I ceased to care about anything more than my ETS date.

Collective punishment is the sign of a weak leader.  I have my own
leadership duties as a civilian, more so than I had in the military.  You
bet your ass I am not afraid to make a person responsible for his or her own
actions.
