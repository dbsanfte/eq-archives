Apparently there are no longer boats that go to and from Qeynos and
Erudin; instead, they have translocators.  I found the translocator at
the Qeynos docks and she says something about how the boats aren't
working and how she will be happy to translocate me to Erud's Crossing
and then her assistant there will translocate me from there.  I got
translocated to the dock over on Kerra Island but I don't see a
translocator there.  Where is the other translocator to take me from
Kerra Island to Erudin?

Thanks in advance,
