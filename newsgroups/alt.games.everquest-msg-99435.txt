Cool beans! But given that our two highest wizards are 54 and 49, and
our highest bards are 52 and 50, do you think you and four of the
wizards from MoM could do a quick character transfer before 8 pm tonight
and pop by to help out? ;-)
(I can't pony up the fifty bucks each way for you, but I will buy you a
case of rolling rock. Heh he he)

One serious question on that, though. (Given that I know nothing of the
mechanics of those spells and songs in that line) Back when I played my
pathetic cleric, I seem to recall that while DA lasted, you couldn't
cast anything else, or attack, or basically do anything but RUN FOR YOU
LIFE! How does it work with a bard song DA? Can the wizards still nuke
and the MA still attack and taunt while the DA song is in effect? Not
that we can do it now, but I've always got my ears perked for future
strategy tips.
