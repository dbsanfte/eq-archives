F10 just switches between 3 video modes.  Normal with the display in a 
center window, with all the control buttons arranged outside the display 
window; full-screen mode which has the controls as transparant overlays 
over the display; and pretty screenshot mode which just shows the view, 
with no control or chat or anything else visable.


Arolpin
ours go to F11
