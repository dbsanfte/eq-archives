Emulators are not illegal so long as they use no propriatary code in
the emulator itself. This was tested in court against some early UO
emulators.

Connecting to the emulator, however, violates your EULA, so
technically if you connect to an EMU, you should discontinue your
subscription and destroy your disks.

But, what liklihood is it for Sony to demand that users quit sending
them money?

There are two working EQ emulators out there, if you are curious.
Closed development: Ethernalquest at www.ethernalquest.org
Opne development:   EQEMU at www.eqemu.net

I have ran an EQEMU server for LAN parties, and having the EQ world
fully customizable makes for some fun play on a LAN. We had 5 players
and me.
 
I had a dungeon crawl:
Start in Crushbone, populated with humans and elves. 2 zone lines,
normal one zones to Blackburrow, and a custom zone line in the
Slaver's tunnel leads to SolB.
SolB leads to Nurga mines.
Nurga leads to Najeena, which leads to Nektulos.
Nektulos leads out to LGuk, which leads to UGuk.
Uguk leads back to Blackburrow.

Populated throughout with what I can use out of the global files, with
some specifics for the zones. Mostly named "an undead whatever" or "a
shambling corpse". Some underdark type creatures and monsters tossed
around to keep it 'lively'.

We had a blast, I DM'd as a Server GM, posessed creatures as needed,
and lead them on quite the adventure.

Note: this took about a month of prep work to make it all fit right.
As the designer, I was almost sick of the zones by the time it was
working. Took 3 servers running Windows 2000  on each. Didn't really
need that strong a machine, and graphics were not needed at all.
PIII/600 with 768Mb RAM
PII/450 with 386Mb RAM
Dual PIII/1G with 1G RAM(doubled as GM machine, so it had a Geforce2)
