Question is, does someone who is running an illegitimate operation 
deserve to be scammed out of their money?

I mean, stop me if I'm wrong, but isn't selling in game cash (at least, 
EQ in game cash) a violation of the agreement you endorse every time you 
play?

What did this guy do?  He got some people to provide him with illegal 
goods, and then didn't pay them.

Talking about what someone running a legit operation deserves is beside 
the point.

Personally, I don't think someone running an quasi legal operation like 
this deserves to be defrauded like this, either.  But it did make me 
think for a second,and I have to admit that one of the things I thought 
was "good, maybe this will catch on and the copycats will descend on the 
people selling cash and items in game for real world cash will get put 
out of business"

Legal efforts to stop them seem to have ground to a halt, I mean, there 
is no bigger, clearer target than Yantis out there today, I don't see 
how he at least isn't having actions brought against him to serve as an 
example (which would only drive sales like this underground...)
