Yeah, it's the same long journey that a druid makes when
he gives someone a port, that person donates 8gp, and the
druid insults him, right?

Or is there some difference in your mind between "can
someone rez me?" and "can someone port me?"  Oh, yeah,
the difference is no one NEEDS a port, right?  Well, no
one NEEDS a rez, either.  You getting *your* XP back has
exactly the same relevance to me as *my* getting to a
fighting zone faster so I can get XP does to you:  zip.

Oh, yeah, *your* time at level 30 is more important than
*my* time at 56.  After all, it'll take you longer to level
at 30 than it will me to level at 56, right?

> a druid (or wizard) that's the same level as this cleric

Yeah, but most people will still *offer* to donate and
won't ask for a port knowing they don't have the plat or
won't donate.  Always get the price set up-front, I'd say.
And if you're not going to donate enough to make it worth
my time (and that of my group if we're fighting), find
someone else, 'cause I sure won't do it.  Any my time at
56+ is a LOT more valuable than a 34 druid's...

(Then you get the "thanks, and now you can f'in walk
back"-types who forget that clerics can Gate.  Those
are always very amusing.  /smirk /bye /cast 8  ;)

So now that *you* don't need the money, no one else does
either, right?  Well, of course you earned that money
then so you don't need it now.  I guess that the idea
that someone else didn't earn it then and does need it
now never crosses your mind, right?

And the difference between getting to the next zone (so
you can get to a certain XP level faster) and getting a
rez (so you can get to a certain XP level faster) is
what again?

The *only* thing you're saving with either is your time.
If you want ports, start a druid/wizard or pay for them.
If you want a rez, start a cleric/pally or pay for them.

/shrug

That's why I've got a cleric and a wizard on my account
and my wife has a mage and druid on hers.  Not to mention
being in a guild where quite a few of the members have
port mules.  Now we just have to PL a chanter up for
Clarity...
