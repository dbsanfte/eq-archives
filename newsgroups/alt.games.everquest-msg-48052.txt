No, august/september of this year.

I know that personally, my patience for ship-now-patch-later has ended. I'm
sure I'm not the only one. There will be people who will boot up the game,
see that it isn't working properly, and will not put up with the first 2
weeks of daily patches, and return it. Eventually, one of these major
releases will fail utterly because of it, that company will go OUT OF
BUSINESS, and (with the benevolance of a merciful deity) the other
developers will say "hmm, I want to keep my job, so maybe we'll test this a
little more before we release it".

The real problem with the DAoC need for beta is that ALL of the beta still
needed is in their PvP, which is the entire endgame.
