Something that may be fun as part of a recruiting process is to make up your
own guild quest for prospective new members.

It should be a quest that reflects your guild's goals and values.  The
reward could be a specific piece of enchanter-made jewelry that your guild
members could wear as a token or badge of their membership, or something
along those lines.
