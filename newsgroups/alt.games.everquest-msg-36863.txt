It's only irrelevant if it flew over your head and you totally missed
the point.

The original poster said:

" Frankly, no matter how strongly you feel about this particular subject,
you must admit that the fact that you have been playing (and, hopefully,
enjoying) the game for this long is an indicator that the Verant game
designers are anything but stupid ".

This quote equates the length of time a player has been paying Verant 
to the intelligence of the game designers. 

The tax response illustrated perfectly the idiocy in such a correlation.
