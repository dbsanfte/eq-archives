Heart Flutter got resisted about one in three times, so they can
certainly have a high resist rate. I didn't try fearing them, nor will I
likely (unless I really need time to gate/camp or something) but I did
read on a necro board that they could be feared.

The more common alternate method to tanking seems to be to druid kite
them. (i.e. cast snare, get massive aggro, /pet no taunt, and run around
the base of the island with them chasing you and the pet beating them.)
However, given the nature of the terrain around the shoreline, I'd
probably die from falling damage before Jabober could gank them. Heh.

Allegedly, though, it can be done. Some 16/17 necros posted that they
solo'd there in that fashion when they didn't have the mana/HP to go toe
to toe. I know that my 4th level darkness snare was almost *never*
resisted, which is a very good thing. The downside to that is when you
get an overpull and FD. Then you forget that clinging darkness is also a
*DOT* as well as snare, so you stand up and on the next DOT pulse they
come charging after you again.
*sigh*
This type of lesson, my friends, is how we curb stupidity, even though
it can never be truly cured.
