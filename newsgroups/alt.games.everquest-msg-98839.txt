<cough> <sputter> <choke>

Take a look at the logs Georg posted from her new gnome SK last night.
Number of mobs required to kill to finish level 3 was less than 33% of a
pre-patch newbie. That doesn't even get into the other easiness factors
of free gates to town, zero corpse runs, etc. etc. etc.

I played one too. (Pally, though.) Frankly, I got so bored I gave up.
