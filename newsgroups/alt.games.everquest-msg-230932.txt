Which is where it matters.  At the high end, it's relatively easy to max
stats.  Below 50, most people are struggling to get to 200 of their prime
stat (unless twinked).  100hp at level 65 for a chanter reallyt makes very
little difference if they are on the dinner plate, but an additional 50 mana
at level 30 can make a difference between casting one more root just in
time.
