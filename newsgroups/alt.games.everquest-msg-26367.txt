Here is a cut and paste from Joe D's post including the link to the
original comment from Absor.

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000240.html

Absor sez:
Yes, we were prompted to change this by what we saw on Sullon Zek.
Discovering that people could fund blacksmithing fine plate within three
days of the server opening using this one baking recipe exclusively was
what
brought it to our attention. But we would have changed it no matter how
it
was brought to our attention. The prices were not in line with the goals
we
have for trade skills.
