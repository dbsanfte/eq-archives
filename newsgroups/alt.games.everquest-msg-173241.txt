First:  PR and caring about the rest of the world are two different things.
It is quite possible to do what you can to improve the world while to giving
a flying fuck what other people think of you.  Unless you're one of those
people who think that the only worthwhile goal is to be popular.

Second:  I want to get something straight before I blast you -- you seem to
be implying that the only reason the US doesn't nuke the hell out of
everyone within missile range is because we're afraid people won't like
us... is that right?
