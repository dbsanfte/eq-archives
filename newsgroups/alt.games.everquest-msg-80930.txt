Set a hot key up for taunt and use it on every blue mob to raise your skill. 
Even if you are fighting alone.
Of course when grouping you WON'T want to use it if there are REAL tanks ....
your armor class is worse than theirs and you'll suck the healers mana trying
to keep you healthy.
But you'll have your skill up when it's needed.
