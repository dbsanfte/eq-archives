It's a cheesy implementation.  They won't light a terrain polygon at all
unless your light is "big enough", so when you move to where your light
covers part of a poly that's too big for it you get nothing.  This means
that the POS newbie candle can't even light your way thru the tunnel out
of Surefall, a fire beetle eye only works about half the time moving
thru it, and a GLS works great there.  Light equivalent to GLS works
well in most underground areas, but out-of-doors it can be spotty (watch
yourself in third person running thru WK or SK at night sometime).

To the OP:  Greater lightsource (GLS or equivalent) has always worked
well for me in Neth. Lair and Paludal.  The other player who mentioned
having a weak lightsource override a stronger one probably has the right
idea.  I've never tried to figure out what the "lightsource priority" is
for all slots, but the primary weapon slot seems to override everything
and both range and secondary seem to override face.  Good luck.
