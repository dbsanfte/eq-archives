Egress rocks, I ended up buying it for 200, same for Upheaval, since every
turn in that I did I just got more copies of Call and Glamour.

4 more blue and I can use Glamour, wheeeeeeeee.

If you're having issues with exp in 52, I'd suggest going to CoM and soloing
the temple area (it's called the temple on the eqatlas map), nothing is
social in the zone except army behemoths (rare spawn inside the temple and a
couple other places) and Black Reavers, skeletons always see invis, golems
never do, ghosts it's about a 1/5 chance of seeing (shadows don't, the other
types can), I've never had anything resist Breath of Ro more than once and
you should be able to root/dot in the open area in front of the temple, as
well as pull the ledges, inside the temple, and if you run a little short on
spawns, the upper "gazebo" part.  To get to this area easy, zone in, camo
up, jump in the water and theres a tunnel at the bottom in the far left, go
through there and take the first right and follow the right hand wall,
you'll pop up in the water in front of the temple.  You'll have to figure
out the slightly funky pathing, but suffice to say, keep egress or gate up
(if gate, bind at the zone line), and if things go bad, swim over to the
other side of the temple and you should have enough time to gate (things
path THROUGH the temple rather than over the slightly broken bridge in
front, but as I said, nearly nothing is social).  If the temple is camped,
you can also do the 'apartment building' (my name for it) to the right of
the goo temple/arena, or the spawns on the path behind it as you head
towards the first reaver.

If dungeon soloing isn't your thing, seafuries aren't bad either, about
5khp, 4 Breath/drones sets finish them off for me, the money isn't bad, and
you can gank Gornit to increase the cash influx (but he should be green/cyan
entirely, whereas normal seafuries might be cyan 1/5 to 1/10 of the time,
just don't pull the cyan ones, and watch out for Quag and the
tainted/corrupted)
