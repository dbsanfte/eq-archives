Just because Ive been incredibley vocal against soe and thier latest
patch they refuse to let me post now.  Only once have a I used any
words that would be deemed out of line.  I see lots of people using
language that would be deemed bad and they can stil post.

Why have I been singled out? Dont like the fact that I speak the truth
about your policies and the game itself?  

In your attempts to control the ecnomy you have ruined this game,
beyond that theres no more point in saying anything else excpet this:

Soon as I get paid Im moving on to wow or ANYTHING else besides one of
your games. Neve again will I play a game made by soe.  I have been
playing online computer games since the days of Meridian 69 and the
only time I put up with this was when UO came out. That was 7 years
ago. With your expieince with Eq1 there is no reason for us to be
playing a betta this buged!
