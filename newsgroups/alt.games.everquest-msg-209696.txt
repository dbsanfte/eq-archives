Another solution that might have made the SK feel less terrible but still
rewarded her for the work of triggering the mob would be to give her some
kind of bonus on rolling.  E.g., everyone else rolls 0-100.  She rolls
0-120, or she rolls 0-100 and adds 10, or she rolls twice, or something like
that.

For this particular mob, since you need four bones to turn in, and assuming
that this is MQable, perhaps give everyone who provides a bone +5 per bone
to add to their roll, or something like that.
