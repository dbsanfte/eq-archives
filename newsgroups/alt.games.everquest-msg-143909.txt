Yes.  And no.  Depends who you run into, really.  There _is_ a strong
roleplaying community on FV, and several guilds that support/demand
roleplaying from their members (I'm in one of those, and it is a
blast).  I've had evil characters refuse a rez from my lightie cleric. 
Others won't group or sell to/from characters of opposite alignment.
   But several people don't.  I hear "heal plz dude" from time to time,
and well as the occasional dude-speak demand for PLing.  But not as much
as on a normal bluebie.  There isn't too much ooc chatter (no ooc
channel at all, in fact).  That said, I had to endure a conversation in
/shout the other day that consisted of Monty Python lines going back and
forth.  I never enjoyed this sort of thing on Drinal, and it was
particularly annoying on FV.

No.  Sparse, but most zones I go to have a least a couple of players
in.  People can twink with a second account, or from re-rolls (which are
fairly common).  What really turns people off, I think, it the TLC.  It
does odd things to the economy, also.  But I think it is worth putting
up with to avoid the population crunches you see on other servers. 

> 3) Any tips from players on FV

Make an enchanter, get him/her to 30ish, then group with Lenny and I. 
We'd rule the world!  Seriously.
   Other advice, hmmm.  Join a good roleplaying guild.  I like mine, but
there are others a well that are also serviceable.  Having a network of
friends is more important on FV than on other servers, since finding a
Pick up group can be tough, most of the time.  Be mindful of your
reputation.  FV has a pretty close knit community.  We have enough
druids and rangers.  
  Want more information?  Go to our community board.
