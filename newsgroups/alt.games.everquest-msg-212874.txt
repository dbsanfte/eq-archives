    Thanks for the suggestions... have done remains twice now but haven't
had either of our warriors on hand to loot the sword, which hasn't dropped
anyway ;(

    From another post... where in kael is the "plate cycle"? I'm assuming
its a cycle of spawns *somewhere* on that little map... Gearing up our
warriors with thurg quest armour sounds like a plan, although I've noticed
that the SK thurg gear is a waste of gems these days.

Cheers,
James
