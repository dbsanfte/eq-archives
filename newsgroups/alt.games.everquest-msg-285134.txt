Sorry bud, anyone under level 10 that has been inactive for more than
6 months are deleted.  You could try to petition for lost character
but don't expect sympathic GM or reimbursed items.

No.  Maybe the newest expansion TSS as it does have "new" newbie zones
and such but other than that, anything above Luclin would be high end
zone.  PoP starts at 46 and some higher PoP zones requires raid to get
flagged or keyed and that is usually 60+

LDoN is probably OK but very few play these zones nowday and you need
minimum of 3 to start any adventure.

LoY is more of mid range zone (45+) and all other expansions from GoD
to PoR is high level.

On Maelin (one of the top 2 populated server post merger) I still had
some trouble finding group for under 20 unless I was on weekday
evening or weekend.

As long as you can get to PoK, you can get to guild lobby (used to be
DoN required but it was opened to all a few months ago) so if you died
in hard to reach spot.  You'd only need to buy a summons tone in the
lobby suitable for your level (higher level = more expensive, max
about 200pp with low CHA) and you can summon ALL corpses at once.
Then you can get a rez there since cleric usually hangs around there
for easy money.

Vet AA is based on how long your paid subscribtion has been.  First
year paid (including a 1 or 2 year(s) payment on new account) you get
vet AA.  It is permanet but you can't reassign them so if you delete
your character, you won't get the option to choose another to claim
vet aa's.

First year AA is double XP for 30 minutes or until you get killed.
Rule for this one: never announce you popped the xp aa because you
will die in less than 5 minutes. EQ is like this at times.

Other AA's are useful or useless.  Like 3rd year AA is the jester but
it's so unpopular that my guild banned jester in raid and will boot
anyone from raid until the person logs out to kill the jester.

North Freeport is gone.  It is now part of the new East/West Freeport
and there is now a separate sewer zone.

Oasis is still there, it is part of new South Ro.  The 2 zones were
made shorter and joined together.

Nektulos Forest have been redone twice, the version 2 was very
unpopular version that looks like Play-Doh version.  Current version 3
has similiar layout to original forest but with very nice graphics.

Lavastorm was also revamped with the release of DoN.

And Highpass Keep was revamped last month when SOE added new zones for
TSS expansion.

The boats have been MIA for a few years but they got the boat in
Nedaria-Abysmal Sea-Natimbi route working last I checked.  They were
trying to get other boats working but they will probably leave the
gnome TL'ers for those who don't want to wait.

Better to ask what wasn't changed with the UI.  So much has been
changed you should consider doing the tutorial just to figure out the
new interface.

I have used keyboard almost exclusively so it is possible but you may
need to learn the new commands that changed, keyboard layout that may
have changed since you last played, etc.  Like I said, do the tutorial
and stick there until you can get a handle on keyboard and can play
well with your older characters.

Many spells are still a pain in the ass to get.  My main was short
almost 20 spells, all of them from high end OOW, DoDH, and PoR zones
plus a couple LDoN spells (now researchable I think) and OoW/DoDH
ancient and glowing rune spells. Level 70 spells from DoDH/OoW is
somewhat rare and my dice keeps blowing. :(  My kitty beastlord wants
that level 70 slow spell. 

Actually level 1 spells will be the hardest to get if your old
character started before SOE allowed level 1 spells in tutorial or if
you skipped tutorial because once you're level 11+, there is no way to
get it.
