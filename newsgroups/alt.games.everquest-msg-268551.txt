Run? Yes.

My brother started playing on a computer with slightly less stats than
yours.  He's since upgraded his memory, which improves so many things
(lag, load times, etc).

The game won't look as pretty as the pictures with that vid card, but
try it and see how much you can push it.  I'd get more memory though.
