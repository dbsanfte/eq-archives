Can you explain to me how the existence of an active directory would
in anyway affect the network in question?

Since you seem to think dcpromo-ing a Win2K machine would
automagically cause the subsequent LAN to "become" a Win2K network.

Similarly, how is the network affected by the WinNT authenticating
instead of against it's local SAM database, it authenicates against
the DC's SAM?
