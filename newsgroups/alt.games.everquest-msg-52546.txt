No he's claimed to be i think 22, and he likes gay teens, hates retards
cause they get to go ahead of him in line at six flags, has claimed to
be gay, etc.  I think it's a combination he is a troll from the shallow
end of the gene pool.  I think he is hoping to make a guild of gay teens
so he can start soliciting them for sex.  Which if I am not mistaken
given that they are teenagers, would be considered a crime.  Mayhaps we
should gather some posts of his, and forward them to the FBI?
