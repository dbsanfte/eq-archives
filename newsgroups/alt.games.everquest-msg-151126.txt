As my new character in the bazaar, as Trader class,  shops for supplies good
deals he turns away from the cluster**** and bys elsewhere. I then hear
traders moan and groan they never sell anything. No kidding I shop at the
back. Many tradeskills suppliers have permanent spots I now just run to
without the bazaar search.

Trader merchant level >300K plat and inventory in 3 weeks. Starting level
2K. Yes most of the plat will be clicked away on skillups.....

I wonder what the Trader class in EQ will be like.
