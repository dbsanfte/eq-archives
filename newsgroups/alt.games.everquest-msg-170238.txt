Regular KEI...Extended KEI...really, when push comes to shove there's no
difference.  Sure as hell somehow in the 30 minutes after it's cast on you
you'll either die or get dispelled. :)

I've gotten to the point of blessing enchanters that are auctioning it in
Nexus...it means I won't be bugged too much and might be able to leave /role
off a little longer.

I've long ago gotten to the point where I ignore people who send me tells
asking if I'm whoring myself out (even if they're polite about it).  I
figure that my rudeness equals theirs (for sending a buff beg tell to a
stranger), so it's all good.
