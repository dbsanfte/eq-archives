And I will stick firm to the fact that you don't know what you're talking
about.

I went out tonight, in fact, with a person who, in the FANG, I had a heated
rivalry with.  It seems that his brother met with some misfortune, which
brought my rival to the area in which I live.  We went out, had a few beers,
talked in depth about how stupid it really was to have had such an intense
rivalry on a video game newsgroup, buried the proverbial hatchet and shook
hands at the end.  It seems to me that if anyone takes it so seriously that
they're going to get bunched up over it, they need to reassess what reality
actually is.
