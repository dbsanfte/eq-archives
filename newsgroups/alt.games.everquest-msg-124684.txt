Hrmm.... Call of Earth, Strength of Nature, Greater Wolf form,
Mark of the Predator, Chloroplast, Feet like cat, Shield of
thorns, Bramblecoat, call of fire.... damn.... damn... must be 
1 more I'm forgetting... hrmm..

However... Thats a fair old whack of AC, HP, damage shield
, ATK and regen. Rangers DO get a lot of useful buffs that
significantly affect combat performance. Its stupid to run
at full buffs though... not just for heals over time, but the
first DOT that hits you is going to wipe out a buff and it might
be an important one like POTG or KEI ;)

Certainly ask if he's running thorns and feet like cat - they can
both be the first to go.

FWIW:
Call of Earth:      AC & damage shield
Strength of nature: HP & ATK
GWolf:              Ultravision, Speed, ATK
MOP:                Pure ATK
Chloroplast:        Regen
Feet like cat:      +AGI (who careS?)
Shield of thorns:   Pure Damage shield
Bramblecoat:        AC, DS, HP(?)
Call of Fire/Jolti: Proc a 65dd stun, or jolt (Aggro reducer)

If he's not meant to be tanking you can yelp to drop the AC/DS
components I suppose... Jolting blades will be important. If
he IS tanking they're all pretty good, but feet like cat can be
lost.

Never underestimate the power of pure ATK buffs either, you
should be getting all your melee buffed with them.

Melee stats (for non MA's) go something like this in my opinion:

ATK -> Haste -> HP -> AC/Resists/Regen -> Everything else
