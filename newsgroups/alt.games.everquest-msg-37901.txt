For some odd reason I read "cleric" into what you were responding to.  I can
certainly see why a cleric would have only a few hundred plat at 50,
especially if they don't stand up for their rights to be reimbursed off the
top for their reagent cost.

Anyway, yeah, 100 in 4 hours is certainly doable in LIO solo, though I
disagree with the death comment for grouping.  I think I've died there only
once in pick-up groups.
