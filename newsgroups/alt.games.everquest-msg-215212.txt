Well, I must say that's a shock.  Next you're gonna tell me that the
first toon to ding 60 (some Ranger on Tunare server) after Kunark came
out did it by using 4 other accounts to PL the character 24x7 killing
dwarves in Butcherblock [*] (obviously several players were required to
keep him killing until he hit 60).

[*] I might be slightly off in the details, but that one kinda stuck
in my mind as a shining example of why there is no meaning to any sort
of "individual" competition in EQ.
