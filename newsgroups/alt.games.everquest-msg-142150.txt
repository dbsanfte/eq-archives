I poped in last night.
However trying to keep up with 3 chanels lead to me being run over by a
griffin.
Not nice for my 19 chanter.
By the time I realised I had about 50hp left.
When mes stuck I had 7 :-/

Next time Im skilling up jewlery I will join again, but out in hunting
zones I think that my limited amout of attention will cause me problems
:-(

On a ligher note I did ding 20 later on <G>

Oh and I dropped Teapray a tell to join age, but got no reply :-(

Jim
