Picked up a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate Sunday morning while camping the
TT hunter/forager cycle for rares, waiting for a raid to start. I've
looked it over and debated, but it's obviously a useless chest slot item
to a 54 warrior who never solos and is 95% either MA or SA on raids and
xp/loot grind groups, and who most always has anywhere from one to a
dozen healers of various sorts watching his health bar.

I may be making a discount deal with a guildie on this, but if not and
I'm forced to auction in Greater FeyMart, what's it going for on your
servers these days? Eqprices.com listed it at 8200 Plat, and Alakhslap
showed it around 6700, but those numbers are generally even more
worthless than usual since Luclin came out. While /auctioning for
something else in Gfey this weekend, I saw one guy offering 4K and
another one offering a couple K and a stack of items, so I'm thinking
they are in demand. (This was before I picked mine up.)  So what's
normal for them in these latter mudflation days?
