Wow, again I have the bad luck. I hunted Misty until level 10 and not once have
I found anything like that. I'm not complaining or anything but how come so
very few people on Quellious are so generous? 

But hey, this gives me a few reasons to hunt greens. 
1)to hopefully find a weapon or armor
2)build up tailoring skill
3)rase faction
