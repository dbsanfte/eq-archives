I along with 3 other friends will be starting up EQ on the RP server
and I'm looking for some advice for a good 4-person group (we'll be
doing everything ourselves, and untwinked). I'm definitely adding a
Shaman as one for debuff, buff, and slow. What should I do with the
other 3? We're pretty much open to play any class (they've all played
several classes). I'm thinking we're going to need at least someone
who can ress, and at least one person who can play main tank. Ports I
don't think is going to be a necessity (we're all going to have PoP)
and having a Shaman around to SoW is fine.

1) Shaman
2) ?
3) ?
4) ?
