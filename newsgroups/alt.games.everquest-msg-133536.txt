Master loot works but I prefer this modification.

Master looter takes all his cash out. Turns split off. At the end os
the session session, he uses /split plats gold silver copper for all
his money.

Each looted item gets distributed either alpha or random until all get
one item, then you go for seconds. Things like Giant toes or heads,
succulent sap, herbs, runes or pages go to interested parties equally.
(Two rogues want sap they each get them as they drop) (three members
want Frost Giant toes, they get them) (One enchanter gets grimore
pages they share) (Now wizards in party but two members wants runes
they share)

Most of the time it works, and with a predetermined split time you
dont have people booking.

One of the worst raids I went on was a TOFS raid. Three parties. The
first party got all the EXP, the second got all the loots, and the
third got nothing. We healed and claritied. I gated from the third
floor and went home. No (Clarity) Soup for you! BTW there was no loot
plan, another person who stayed in the third group got 15pp for a
nights work, no exp, no keys, no gnomeskin, no nothing else. Bad loot
policies make me shy away from that guilds activities.
