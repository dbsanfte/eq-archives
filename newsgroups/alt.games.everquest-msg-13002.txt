My shaman was offering free SoWs at Qeynos gates earlier tonight when a
warrior ran up and asked me what SoW was exactly...

I could have wept for joy that there was still such naievety in the world of
Norrath...

After telling him the full name and effect I cast it on him and kept getting
tells for the next 5 minutes saying "This is really cool." and "Hey it works
for swimming too!". Absolutely made my day.

Just hope I haven't created a "SoW whore"! :o)
