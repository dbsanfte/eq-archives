I see multiple enchanters all oocing that they are casting for donations in 
the nexus all the time, what's to stop one from leaving, or another from 
adding their voice to it?

Sure it is, if people won't pay the price being asked, the enchanter can 
either lower the price, or not sell.  If people are willing to pay the 
price, well, then there is no issue.  Personally, I find that the current 
accepted normal price is well worth it to me, so I pay it.  If, I found it 
to be too high, I would do without.

On EMarr at least, I have yet to see anyone do anything but offer KEI for 
donations, some say not required, some don't, but never a price.  Virtue 
and Aego I see clerics putting a price on, but then, there is an actual 
direct cost in plat to them to cast it that is over and above the "cost" of 
sitting around selling buffs vs. going out and killing and looting.
