The GM went down to Surefall
He was lookin' for a song to steal 
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind 
and he was willin' to make a deal 

When he came across this young bard 
sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot 
And the GM jumped up on a hickory stump and said, 
"Bard, let me tell you what. 

"I guess you didn't know it 
but I'm a fiddle player, too. 
And if you'd care to take a dare, 
I'll make a bet with you. 

"Now, you play pretty good fiddle, boy, but
give Verant its due. 
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your song, 
'cause I think I'm better than you." 

The bard said, "My name's Fansy, 
and it might be a sin, 
but I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret,
'cause I'm the best that's ever been."

 Fansy, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard, 
  'cause cshome's broke loose in Norrath and the GM deals the cards. 
 And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
  But if you lose, the GM nerfs your song...

The GM started up his twist
and he said, "I'll start this show." 
And fire flew from his fingertips 
as he rosined up his bow.

And he pulled the bow across the strings 
and it made an evil hiss. 
Then a band of demons joined in 
and it sounded somethin' like this.

When the GM finished, Fansy said, 
"Well, you're pretty good, old son, 
but /sit down in that chair right there 
and let me show you how it's done."

 Selos on the mountain. Run, boys, run. 
  The GM's in the Zone of the Rising Sun. 
 Cheese in the frying pan pickin' out dough. 
  Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.

{insert very impressive mp3 fiddle solo}

The GM /bowed his head 
because he knew that he'd been beat. 
And he laid that golden fiddle
on the ground at Fansy's feet. 

Fansy said, "GM, just come on back 
if you ever want to try again. 
'Cause I told you once, you son of a gun, 
I'm the best that's ever been."

{With apologies to the Charlie Daniels Band}
