I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but with the new
pet buff icon window, I got to wondering if charmed pets showed
that box too.

Got to wondering it real hard, in fact.

Because, you see, I was busily killing Snow Griffins trying to
gather some eggs for a friend.  Long ago when I was doing this
for my cleric, we determined that they had either 5 or 6 buffs,
and that the buff order was random; in order to be sure of
killing the SOW you needed to remove all the buffs, which I could
do in three casts.

Well, today I'm a little 40 mage, and that means I have only
Cancel Magic to work with.  Casting Cancel Magic 6 times in a row
is a lot of time spent not healing pet or nuking.

So I logged out, logged in my 57 bard on Morel Thule, and ran him
over to the zone.  Found a griff very easily (funny how track and
blinding selos speed will get you a mob right away, while the
mage finds maybe one every ten minutes at best) and charmed it. 
Sure enough, buff icon window.  Showed only 4 buffs, plus a red
icon which was my charm song.

Skin like Rock, Riftwind's Protection, Firefist, and Spirit of
Wolf, in that order.

A) thats great news, I only have to take out four buffs, not six.

B) by taking them all out, I'm reducing HP, AC, Attack, removing
the DS, and of course the mission critical part, killing the
excessive run speed. 

Now to be really sure I'd have to repeat the experiment several
times to see if all the griffs have the same buffs up in the same
order. And it would be handy to see which order they are removed
in; there's a good chance if I was removing the SOW first cast
every time I wouldn't bother with the others.

How many other mobs can we get buff information on this way, or
is there a resource out there somewhere where this information is
already known?
