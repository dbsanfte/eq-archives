Pre-60, if the tank is dropping so fast that the shammy has to go
to spam healing to save him - it's time for an evac.  We always
had a core trio of Ranger, Druid, Mage that we added people to.
With a shammy the druid rarely had to take over healing so we could
keep up pulls.  With a cleric we often had them go LoM and the
druid would take over while they medded.

Remember that mid-50's rangers don't have enough HP to truly
make CH effective.

When we added another account and were deciding on what class
(shaman or cleric) it was a close race, but the res turned the tide.
If res weren't an issue, we'd have chosen to make a shaman to
box with our party.
