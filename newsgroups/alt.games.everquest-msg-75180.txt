I disagree, TW is a great emergency snare for if  you loose sow and the
mob's snare wears off it is great to reach out and grab the mob. The stats
are wrong, the cast time is 1sec not 2 and that is all the difference. My
druid is only lvl14 and he is still doing a lot of melee. At higher lvls
where you do not want the mob to be able to run this is equally as valuable
as a backup for ER and Snare jsut because of it's near instant cast time.

IMHO
