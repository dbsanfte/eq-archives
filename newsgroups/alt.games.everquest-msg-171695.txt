I can tell u what works for me,
I have similar set up, 2 comps, connected to cable, 2nd comp connected
through network hub.

Quit to desktop and reload EQ, ( if eq already hasnt dumped u to
desktop ) P.

Log in and go to chat room
type /q

quit game and reboot PC(s)

U should now be able to load, normally

It works for me every time, a pain, but at least i dont get active
char message.

Hope it helps
