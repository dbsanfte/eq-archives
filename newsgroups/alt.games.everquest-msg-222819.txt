If you're a necro or SK, you can pretty much explore the place at
will. It's divided into live and undead areas so you need IVU and
regular invis to more around at will. There might be one area in deep
that has both undead and regular mobs, not sure if the the hands are
undead or not? 

If that isn't an option, you really need to take a good group in at
least once to get a feel for the place. The first half of the dungeon
is a linear design with a couple of side rooms but you can't really
take any wrong turns till you get to the Golems. At that point is
spreads out a bit but once you get used to the place it's pretty
trivial to get people in deep. If you get to the theater, don't cross
the wooden bridge at the top, you will die pulling the building on the
other side if you go in that way. Nothing else really to watch out
for. 

Named are all static spawns with placeholders, pulling is easy, loot
is excellent (probably a must-camp dungeon for chain classes unless
you can afford ornate) but exp isn't that great. Highest level mobs
you'll run across are around 63rd lvl except for one named and a
triggered event, not many casters once you get past the goblins except
for SKs that love to harmtouch and fear you.
