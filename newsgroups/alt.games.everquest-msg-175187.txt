They've made it way to easy to 'misclick' and order the expansion.  On
another note.. is the server STILL not up yet?  On the days I don't have
class, I have work, and this is the only day of classes that I don't have
them all day, so not being able to play since noon is a bit annoying on my
only day off.  Expected, but annoying ;).
