I thought that I needed to reformat because no matter what I did, including
buying a new video card and installing it--which made the situation even
worse (I went from going LD every 30 minutes to every 3 seconds) and having
read and tweaked based on suggestions from nvidia, 3dGuru, et al.  No matter
what, I still cant get system to run EQ--most of time I freeze up on
character selection screen now which never happened before.  I had a system
with voodoo 3, got hit with lightening, saved the material from hard disk,
put it on new machince with voodoo 5 and started seeing LD some and then it
started getting worse (over period of 9 months) to the point of a dozen
lockups in 3 hours.  Since voodoo didnt seem to be supported any more, I
went to nvidia and now, it is worse than ever.  Cant seem to think or find
anything else to do, so am going to smoke the hard disk and start over.

Please explain what you meant by renaming "windows" and " program files" as
a way to avoid reformatting?  Or, please send me to a reference.  I would
very much appreciate.

Where might this be available?  Is it a commercial product that is available
out her in the country?  Is it downloadable?

That sucked :-)  Hope you recovered fine!
