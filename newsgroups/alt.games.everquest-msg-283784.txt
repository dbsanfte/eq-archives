Necro's are a dps class.

They can additionally, 

slow
pull
mezz
snare
nuke
succor (self only)
rez
heal
debuff
+more

But they are primarily a dps class.

You don't say what your class is - so it's hard to know - but if a necro
gives up all their mana (with a very inefficient spell) and the mob lives
longer as a result, some classes will use more mana than they would have
benefitted from anyway.

Necro's get a group wrack later on which gives 300 mana to everyone at the
cost of 600.  But until then, their single target mana givers are very
inefficient.  Many necro's HATE their mana spells.  You found one.

Necro's are not there to feed mana to other characters, they are there to
have fun like everyone else.
