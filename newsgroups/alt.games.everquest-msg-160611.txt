Well, see, before, we *could* take our warders across zone borders... that's
really how it's different.  The point is, it's annoying... I summon my
warder (incidentally using mana, though not all that much mana) and buff him
up (using some more of my mana) to kill a few NPCs on my way to wherever I
happen to be going... then I cross a zone border, still on my way to where
I'm going, and my warder goes away... so I have to resummon if I need him
for any killing (incidentally using a bit *more* mana) and since when I lose
my warder, he loses his buffs, I have to buff him up again (using still more
of my dwindling supply of mana), and if he's hurt at all fighting and
there's more fighting to do but I don't want to wait for him to heal, I have
to use still *more* mana to heal him... then I cross yet another zone
border, again have to summon, buff, and perhaps heal, etc., etc.  Now of
course I can either not summon my warder and just run through the zone
without his protection, or not buff him, or sit and wait for my mana to come
back, but the first two can be dangerous, depending on where I'm at, and the
last option takes a bit of time... it was *so* much simpler when all I had
to do was summon and buff, and he'd follow me wherever I went...
