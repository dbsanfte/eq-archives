40 percent is the break point. If you are below that, you will go bezerk, if
you are above it you will no longer be bezerk.

It looks like it begins lower and ends later, due to how the game works.
The game does not constantly update bezerk status, but instead does it every
few seconds.   So if you dip below 40 just for a second, you may not go
bezerk at all.    Against a hard hitting mob, you may be down to 25 percent
before it checks (although if it's hitting that hard you're probaly not
going to be bezerk for long...)  The other side is that it also does not
take it off immediately. You can be Complete healed, and still get a
crippling blow a second or two after it lands.

Crippling blows do 3x nomral damage, not 4x.   Using Frostreaver, my highest
normal hits are around 250 or 260. (don't pay that much attention)    My
highest critical hit to date is around 440.    My highest crippling blow to
date is around 775.
