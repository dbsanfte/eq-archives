I agree with you. Our setups must be somewhat similar as my chatbox also
sits on top of my viewport. Background colors can and often do cause
text to blend together with that background. It just goes to show that
there probably never will be a perfect solution to this, which is why
options for both text color and background shades in tandem would be
better than no flexibility at all in one area.

I'm happy for you. I know my eyes are not the norm and I don't expect
solutions tailored just for me. What I would like are options. I have
never seen this mentioned before, so while it must have been difficult
for many people to read the dark blue against a dark background,
difficult is still better than not being able to differentiate them at
all.
