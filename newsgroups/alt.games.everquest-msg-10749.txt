What the cultural armor basically misses out on is the stamina of
Umbral. I'm already saving up to buy my druid some elven chainmail
(mainly a fashion thing, but the tunic and sleeves are better than my
current even if the legs are not) and it seems I'll also have to save
up to buy my SK some teir'dal armor one day in the remote future :)
