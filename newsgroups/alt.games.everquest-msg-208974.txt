"Out of melee range" is very loosely defined for some mobs.  Ssra mobs in
particular have an annoying habit of summoning me when I'm right in their
face to a spot where I can no longer hit them.  I'd guess it's related to
hit boxes, as Ssra mobs also have an odd hit box (and I ran into the same
thing yesterday fighting a named dog in BoT with a particularly weird hit
box).
