People can give them back to you.

Here you go Bob, hold this.

Here you go, Razer, hold this
Here you go, Endo, hold this

Guys, drop the rods on the ground, I need
mana -stat-

Course thats a waste, everyone knows those rods are
really for the (insert your class here)... but it -could- happen
that way.  Point is, you make rods when FM and nothing
on the horizon, mana in the bank for later when someone
needs it.

Met more than one mage in his high 40s who never bothered
picking up this spell, yet it is hands down the most important
spell any mage over 44 has in his book when it comes raid
time.
