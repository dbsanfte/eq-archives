I have to say, I think LDoN is the best expansion ever.  This is definitely
unique content that can be done with single groups that yield decent XP and
the chance to accumulate points to get good loot.  It's a godsend for the
casual player and a change of pace for the full-time raider.

I like some other subtle things, like the fact that two-boxing is extremely
unlikely to work.  You need flesh-and-blood behind every toon or you simply
won't finish in time.  My guild has a six-boxer who tried to take on an LDoN
dungeon and got owned.

I like the fact that they made it easy to get to the dungeons, easy to move
between camps, easy to bind close by in case of a wipe.

I like the dungeon designs.  I like the new mob models.  Just overall, I
like the new art, even given the limitations of the EQ engine.  Outstanding
job.

Big thumbs-up to Sony; this expansion all by itself will keep EQ viable for
at least a couple of years to come.
