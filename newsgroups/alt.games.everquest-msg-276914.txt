Wow. OK, yeah, that's a good stroy, too. I think this is the experience
I hear from most people I knew in person.

Just out of curiosity: you mention you started the game not really
knowing what you were doing.  Did you come in with any previous
experience to RPG's (paper-and-dice, computer, live action, etc), was
this initially just another fps for you, or something else?

Xiphos - Working hypothesis: MMO's seem to bring together three very
divergent groups: FPSers, paper-n-dicers, and hack-n-slashers; often
with (disasterous|humerous) results.
