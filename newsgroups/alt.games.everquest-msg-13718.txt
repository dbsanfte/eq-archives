My problem is, I keep getting disconnected.  My cable connection will 
suddenly die, and zooooooom goes the lag bar.  "You have been 
disconnected" is becoming an allllllll too regular sight.  I called my 
ISP to complain the first time, as I got booted 3 times in an hour (and 
this was with my SK with pets - I prefer *not* to lose perfectly good - 
well okay, fairly lame - pets, thank you very much) - then I noticed that 
when I logged off, nothing ever happened - I could be online for hours 
and it didn't happen.  I haven't *proven* anything yet mind you - but 
neither have I yet experienced a disconnection while *not* connected to 
EQ.
