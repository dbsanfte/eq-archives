Generally, it appears to be kinda hard to die in Luclin unless doing
something dumb at least until you hit the tougher zones.

The Deep, Ssra Temple, Akheva Ruins, Umbral, Grieg's, etc...

Those places you can die REAL fast without really trying.

Ok, one exception:  If you lag so freaking hard that you can't move,
dying can be pretty easy.
