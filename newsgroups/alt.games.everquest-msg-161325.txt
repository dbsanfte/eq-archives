Also do the Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap quest.

Gather charisma gear asap. It's cheap and it will help to avoid the halfling
price penalty when you buy and sell to npc vendors.

And for money, start making leather padding as soon as possible. Sell it in
the Bazaar. You will be amazed at the selling price.

Keep all the acorns that you forage. You can only get them in Misty Thicket
and there is pretty much no incentive to go back there at higher levels.
They are used for cultural armor. Sell them high or keep them for your own
tradeskilling.
