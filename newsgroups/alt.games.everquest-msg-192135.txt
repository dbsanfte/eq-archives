Armor class has no effect over a certain number that is mob and zone
dependant. Monks where able to reach this number with good gear. Warriors
complained that a 1800 AC warrior was tanking only slightly better than a
1300 Ac monk. They where right in that something was broken , the fix as is
normal for soe was completely fucked up.

They hard coded leather armor classes to take double dammage from combat.
Since monks are pure melee and where on the low end of balance anyway ,and
hand to hand combat only has 2 factors ,offense and defense, this pretty
much destroyed them. While it was amusing that rogues where tanking better
and doing more dammage than monks it was becomming apparent  that monk
accounts where getting cancelled ,so after a mere 6 monthes they said oops
we might possibly have sorta screwed the pooch again and might have possibly
fixed it. It is probable that they did not fix it completely so that monks
will still be underpowered. It is likely that they also did not fix the
underlying problem of a hard capped AC. It is certain that they broke 3 or
more things in the process.
