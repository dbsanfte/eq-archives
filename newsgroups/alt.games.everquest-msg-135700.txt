I wonder what will happen the first time they target a system
physically outside the US.  There is already plenty of opposition to
the way US laws are affecting those in other countries, and I could
see someone making a big stink over this one.   This at a time where
the US is already under scrutiny over the word court issue, the
Canadian soldiers killed by a US pilot, and the hundreds of civilian
deaths in Afghanistan.
