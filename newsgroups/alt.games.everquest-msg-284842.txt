Tried Overthere for a few minutes with my 17th Ogre shammy. The next
lowest toon was 24th. I took on a Kunark Rhino, yellow, a Sarnak
conscript, yellow, and a Sarnak flunkie. Iwasclose enough, I made
18th level out of it.

I noticed the cliff golem protecting the evil bridgehead. I don't
know if I'll take my 34 ranger to OT or not.

I've done a /who from time to time in PC and noted anywhere from 1
to 25 other toons. Most of the time recently I've seen 10-15 other
toons. I guess they are going after recondite bandits. The various
beetles and sensate rieshies max out rather quickly. Thats on Stromm
and Xegony, with Stromm being the version of PC that has the most
toons on a regular basis.

Oh, if anyone is interested, I have a better Forgotten Halls set of
screen dumps (how to get there and a few tips) than I saw a few
months ago online at:
