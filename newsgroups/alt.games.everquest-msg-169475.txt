A few weeks ago, I noticed that about 90% of the mobs in Kunark were
replaced by the default human model. I noticed it first in Overthere, and
didn't think much of it until zoning into Warsliks and noticing the same
thing. A shout to zone revealed that this was my problem, and not an EQ
thing.

I did some investigating, and found out the following:

This only applies to the Kunark zones, every Kunark zone I visited had
default humans (with no name above their head) as mobs.

Not every mob was a default human, the PB thieves in DL and the drakes in SS
were the correct mobs, as well as the iksar slaves in Nurga (and a few
others ... very few)

I've already tried doing a complete file check, as well as repair, modify,
and uninstall/reinstall from disk (I have the disk with both EQ and Kunark
on it)

I looked in the EQ folder, and noticed that every zone has between 5 - 7
files related to it. Every zone except the Kunark zones. The Kunark zones
have 2 files (.s3d and obj_s3d)

When I went to advanced on the startup screen, I noticed something else I
never noticed before ... there were places to check for automatic file
updates for SoV, Luclin, PoP ... but no Kunark.

Can anybody help me stop looking at all these bald humans?
