May I recommend a better-organized guild? If you start raids on time,
focus on your goals, and make sure that everyone is informed enough to
avoid potential TPWs and recover quickly from the inevitible ones,
you'll find that you get a lot more sleep.

The two raids I've stayed up the latest for were an open Hate raid
with 70+ people and a Ragefire raid where he spawned at 3 AM as we
were logging off from a very successful XP group and it took 2 hours
to get the people together to kill him.

Other than that, I've never had a raid finish later than 3 AM with 95%
done by midnight.
