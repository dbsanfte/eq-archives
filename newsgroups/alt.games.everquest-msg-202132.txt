Well considering the guy is posting from the UK...I would say it was a
justified response.
If he'd been posting from Europe or Asia I would agree with you but I recon
Graefaxe also noticed the location of the poster.

Believe it or not, the people who don't speak English as a first language
are very easy to spot. Those that do and just can't be bothered to use
anything resembling proper grammar or punctuation are generally treated with
a special kind of contempt.
