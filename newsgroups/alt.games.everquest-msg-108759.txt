Ok I just started playing a Barbarian beastlord, and everyone is
right.
They do level like a rocket!
However I have noticed a couple of things that seem strange and I
would like some clarification.

I almost completed the quest where I get the special field priests
claw.
I also have a rusty Ulak.
What happens if put them both on?
I see no reason why I couldn't.
Both use my hand to hand skill and eventually I do get dual wield.
But since both use the same skill (Hand to Hand) and I have one in
each hand.
Wouldn't that give me the equivalent of dual wield?
So if each hits for 5 then I would actually do 20 dmg each tick?
Could someone please tell me if I am correct and if not then why?
Thanks Sincerely
Barut 6lvl BeastLord Karana
