Yes. As with everything in EQ "buying all the [related] AAs" makes a 
significant difference. Any one or two of them though... barely 
registers.

DC is 9 iirc, so it costs as much as a couple others. But -if- you get 
it while its level appropriate, it makes a big difference for a number 
of levels.

Depends on your playstyle i guess... if your just on a mad dash to 70 
skip it... if you want to stop and smell the roses on the way its a 
pretty sweet rose.

More useful in the long run without a doubt.
