I've not played a bard but I would guess start out with something like
banded (about 1pp/AC from player smiths on most servers - a full suit
should be under 100pp) or bronze (mob drop, slightly higher AC than
banded but *very* heavy). Replace that with Lambent armour (bard quest
armour) as and when you can afford to. You need lambent gems (drop off
Hill giants and Griffons) and various mob drops for that, so you are
looking at 30s or so to actually quest for it, although you can always
just buy it.

Also, try doing a search on the equipment database on
