  Replying to myself here.  Reviewing the thread I see what you mean by
"losing his temper".  With this I can agree, unless a Guide is really
mucking things up, you should try to keep your patience with them, for
reasons both polite and pragmatic.  I don't particularly care for the canned
responses myself, but I think it's more conducive to my goal of having my
issue resolved to keep my feelings of frustration in check when
communicating with the Guide.  If the first thing I do is lash out of them
for the canned greeting, I doubt if that Guide is going to feel compelled to
go out of his or her way to help me, especially if they're having a long
night.  I try to keep my Guides happy and treat them with respect, working
with the assumption that they're the "good guy" who really does want to help
me in any way they can... which most of them probably are.  The problems
with the level of service they provide likely stem mostly from the way
they've been trained by Verant, their lack of empowerment/authority and the
fact that many of the most common/annoying problems can't be quickly or
easily verified.
