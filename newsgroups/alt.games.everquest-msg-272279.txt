This is just not true at all.  Sellable loot does not need to come from
chests.  The loot that you are likely to sell to players does only drop
from chests but the vendor sellable loot drops from the corpse.  They
are a lot less value than the chest contents but they drop more
frequently and do add up quite quickly (IMO).  The other thing wrong
here is the statement that chests don't drop from solo encounters.
They do.  At level 22 and 23 I have been soloing the cackling cadavers
and motley kodiaks in Nektulos and I have seen plenty of chests drop.
They don't drop as often as group encounters but then you get every one
instead of one in six for a full group.

As I said before I have been soloing the cackling cadavers in Nek.  At
22 I tried to pick out the yellow cons that were one level above me.
They are challenging but they would give almost 0.5% exps.  That would
mean that about 250 of these would get me to level 23.  I would
probably have to run away from 1 in 5 of these perhaps a bit less.
They can stun you and if they do that a couple of times early on in the
fight then you are in trouble.

I haven't tried soloing group encounters since the increase in damage
but it could be argued that you shouldn't have been able to take on
group encounters on your own in the first place.

Again, solo mobs do drop chests and you get vendor trash loot from the
corpse instead of coins.
