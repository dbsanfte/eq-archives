I looked in the shaman guild several times, even running round some weird system
of ladders for a while.  Didn't think to check the necromancer grotto at all.  I
was missing Flash of Light for quite a while as its on the vendor with the level
24 spells. A friend had a friend who swore he bought Sicken in the Shaman
guild.. well after looking three times I gave up and made the POP run to
Everfrost.  After picking around at that for a bit and deciding I couldn't get
there without Invis, I made an alt.

Solution in hand its real hard to check every vendor for another way.
