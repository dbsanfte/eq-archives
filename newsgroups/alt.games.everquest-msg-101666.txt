I will reply to your original post when I get chance, but to clarify what I
meant with "theres a mage pet that can kick the shit out of you"

A 60 warrior duelled an epic magician pet (not even a level 50+ npc) and the
warrior lost.

Of course there are various things that come into it (resisting the pets
stuns/ice attack thing), regen for the warrior, and most importantly 1hs or
2hs...

but when your hitting something with a 50point damage shield and 3k HP, if
your using 2 fast weapons (lamy, or even something godly like a SoD, Primal
13/18 and 13/20 i think - i dont use slashing weaps) your going to end up
just killing yourself

if for no other reason, because of the damage shield

In a real duel, you wouldn't even waste time on the pet... you would go
straight for the mage, and aim to chop him up in 3 or 4 swings heh
