Kinda depends on what type of a guild you want to get into.
Bristlebane's got a pretty wide selection of guilds ranging from uber
raiding guilds down to the very casual ones that have trouble
completing epic fights that a lot of us can do in a single group these
days.  

Give us some idea of what you're after. ... or send me a tell ingame
if you see me on Bristlbane. Shaman's name is Thurdar. 

Rgds, Frank
