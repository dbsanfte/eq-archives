Have your character custom created in 3D or in pen & paper!  My art
has appeared several times on both EQVault and PlanetEverquest.

I can create a custom designed depiction of your Everquest character
and I can send it to you in JPG or BMP form. OR I can print it out on
glossy paper for framing or create a custom Mousepad or best of all, I
can create a custom T-Shirt with your character on it!  Great for
those EQ get-togethers!

Check out my artwork at:

Happy Adventuring!
