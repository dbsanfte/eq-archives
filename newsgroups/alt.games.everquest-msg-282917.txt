Actually I think they only go from I to V.  Eqtraders says they differ
in how much speed boost they give, sort of like having the SoW cast by
people at different levels (which is why all the potions describe their
effects as just "Spirit of Wolf").  The speeds range from +35% to +55%.

Gate potions are also renamed, to Philter of Major Translocation.

I should add these to the "FAQ" hotkeys on my bazaar mules, to go with
things like where to buy Trader Satchels and what to do with bag tokens. :-)

Oh, and like all the new potions, these no longer come in multiple-dose
forms, because the basic potions stack.
