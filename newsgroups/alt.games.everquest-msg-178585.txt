Help!  My trader crashes to desktop at random intervals since the latest patch!  Havn't seen anything on CR or EQLive - the only reason why I don't think it's just me is that a) it happens on 3 machines and never used to happen on any of them, and b) some other people grumbling about it in the Bazaar.  What's up with this?  It's very annoying, especially when /trader mode is most convenient when you will NOT be there to reconnect in the event of a crash to desktop.

Thanks,
