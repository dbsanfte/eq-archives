I certainly wouldn't say that a bard is generall better at
crowd-control than an enchanter, but I know that I can do better
crowd-control that quite a few of the enchanters I meet in pick up
groups.  I'm suprised that you never group with bards, where do you
hunt?  I can't go into a pick-up dungeon (other than maybe Velks)
without seeing probably a bard in every other group.  Bards are a very
good enchanter substitute for exp grinds, but I wouldn't want to try
to work my way deep into a full-spawn dungeon with a bard as CC (well,
other than myself of course).
