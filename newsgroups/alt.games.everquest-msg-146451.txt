Heh, used to be, used to be.  Since its now a significant
DPS machine (heck it always was) that doesn't cost much
(Big change) particularly with a Summon Efficiency III
item (Come to think of it clerics are now the class
for which this focus makes the most sense) this would
now be the Grand prize in that quest!

If clerics are sensible but not well informed, you should
be able to make a lot of pp by doing the quest and then
selling copies of the hot new "cleric DOT" at high prices.
Sadly, I'm not sure most clerics who are capable of
seeing the benefit of such a spell won't already know
just how to get it.
