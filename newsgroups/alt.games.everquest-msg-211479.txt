The point is, neither you nor me nor self-appointed "minority leaders" 
get to pick whether it's okey or not, it's down to those with whom the 
term is used.

I don't see where we disagree. It's entirely up to the individual to 
decide whether to take offense or not depending on who uses the

even if a *white* guy used the term in a friendly way, if they so choose.
