But its not.

That there's some patching thats gone on at some point since you last 
logged in, yes, thats pretty easy to tell.

But you can't tell if that patch is ongoing, or long over with; the 
files (or at least quite a few) are usually there within an hour of 
start of patch, and from that point on until you can actually log in, 
there's often no further files added.

So, try to log on at, say 7am EST, patch under way, no files loaded yet 
though.  Try again at 7:30, same.  Try again at 8:30, get bunch of 
files, can't log in.  Try again at 10, no files loaded (because you 
already loaded them), still can't log in.  Lets say for the sake of 
arguement that this particular patch is finished at noon.  Try to log in 
at 12:30, though, you might not be able to because the login server may 
be overcrowded.  Log in at 1:30, you get in... but other people have 
been on for an hour and a half, and have already taken advantage of the 
various rare spawns that pop on server refresh.

Alternately, you can believe their posted patch time... which probably 
said they'd finish at 11, and try every 5 minutes from 11 to noon... 
plus several more 5 minutes apart tries because due to the login server 
thing you still can't get in or even tell when its open but you're 
getting crowded out.

Since you've been playing for more years than I have, I'm sure you've 
noticed this... so I'll assume the comment was rhetorical.
