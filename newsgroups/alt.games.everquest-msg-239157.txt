The buildings are basically right beside each other. I used that too.
After I maxed that I started making quenos afternoon teas and kaladim
constitutionals for my own use to max it. I think I did one run of mino
hero brews just for the heck of it but I found for me it was more
incentive to be getting a nice supply of drinks I'd actually use built
up while skilling up. Neither is very expensive to make, though if you
don't have access to a character that can forage tea I suppose the
quenos teas would be. Kaladim constitutionals are just a matter of
sitting around picking mushrooms. I started a dwarf berserker and killed
rats between mushroom spawns for something to do and got a few backpacks
full over the course of a few days of sporadic play. Whether the dwarf
ever gets past L5 remains to be seen.
