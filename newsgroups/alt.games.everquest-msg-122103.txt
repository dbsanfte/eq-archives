Jazz recently asked about upgrading his wizzie, and we
also discussed how int over 200 worked. There was some speculation
each point over 200 was for a fixed amount regardless of level.

Note that currently I'm wearing some non obvious gear because of
the focus effects (Serp bracer is affliction endurance II, Green
drape is affliction haste II, Runed cowl undead pet efficiency III,
Wolf slippers spell haste I, Teachers syllabus enhancement endurance
II, etc, etc...) but I generally have or can obtain better pure
int stuff for the test.

As I said I can go get a +int umbral bracer pretty easily too if you
think that'd help. Ok, what methodology do you think I should use?

Also, my main (I pass on loot a lot so I'm not terrible 00ber):

Hmm. Looking pretty needs updating. I've spent our last 4 TOV raids
in gnomeskin arms, legs and tunic with a mage summoned damage bracer ;)
