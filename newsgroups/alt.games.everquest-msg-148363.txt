    In general: if a spell does multiple things, it has multiple spell
checks (or did previously - this could have changed in the new resist
system). So a DoT with an initial DD component, or a debuff effect, would be
more resisted than a DoT without these things assuming they're both of the
same resist type and both as difficult to resist (no modifiers). Spells with
multiple checks also are either completely resisted, or land for full
because if one component is resisted the spell fails. The cleric DD-stuns
are an example of this - the DD portion never lands for partial damage, it's
all-or-nothing.
