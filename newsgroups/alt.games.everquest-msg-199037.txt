Originally i went to OT for a while and then to DL. But now that i've
explored mopre and made more characters. I'd suggest going to CC. Orcs
would be ok for a start and geos for cash when you can. That'll keep
you busy for a few levels. If you get bored around mid 40s go to BW
and hit the giant fort. As to blunt weapons. i've had a staff of
writhing for ever. Has always been a good weapon for me.
