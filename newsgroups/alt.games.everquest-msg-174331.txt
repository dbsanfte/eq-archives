It seems like since the patch for POP I have been going link dead several
times an hour.  I never had this problem before.  I am connected through DSL
and just purchased a cadillac of a computer.  Any thoughts on the problem?
I did change the number in my eq client files from 5 to 9, per online peer.
Thanks for any info!!  It is driving me crazy.
Jill
