I totaly aggre there are many things that make an item of value to one
person but not to another person and everything inbetween.

But I dont think that takes away from what I said.  The free market economy
in eq is a wonderfull aspect to the game that I wouldnt want to do without.
It just needs to be evened out with hype control.  Hype is a real problem
with many items.  The way to control hype is to provide knowledge about an
item that people want to know before they buy.  I cant say for sure if the
Winblade is hugly better than the AP till i see the thing in action and all
I have to go on is the stats of the weapon.  The numbers are not that much
higher and that is all i have to go on except the huge popularity of the
weapon.  But a web site where real time performance of the weapon is
recorded would save me alot of money in finding out.  Infact untill I see
the real time stats im never going to pay 30k for the weapon because thats
alot of duks.
