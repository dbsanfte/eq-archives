"Bob" is a guildmate of mine.  He sent me a tell yesterday asking me to do a
/who on him, and it gave me the ranger information...even tagged into a
different guild.  He's understandably a little miffed but has been told that
only a GM can help him.

I'm assuming that that's correct.

I first told him that it was just a name bug, that it happened to "Aly" but
that was BEFORE I found out that he really was sending me a tell from the
body of a half elf ranger, with all the ranger's gear.

A new bug?
