I gave my ginger-haired wood elf warrior the red ponytail. I wanted
her to stay redhead and couldn't bear the lighter shades of orange,
and figure it doesn't matter too much anyway since her helmet
completely covers her hair in Luclin graphics. I gave my druid the
white ponytail since the shade of dark brown was too boring. I've been
switching it around from time to time, but a guild enchanter is
threatening with violence if she ever sees me without the white
ponytail again : )

Haven't looked at their models at all. All still shorthaired, eh? At
least the few screenshots I've seen of half elves showed them to look
better than the human female short hair - when even ogres have better
haircuts, you know it's bad!

Probably, and that's probably also the reason the hair colors are so
limited. It seems they have 5 or 6 chunks of hair color specters, and
each model gets a selection of those.
