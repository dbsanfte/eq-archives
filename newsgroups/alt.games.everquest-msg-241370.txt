Hm, I have a seriously stripped level 9 iksar SK, and a virgin level 1 
zerk on FV...about the only thing we could do together is buff me <grin>

Though if you want to roll something up on Sol Ro, I have a level 5 bard 
in addition to my main Aruvqan.

I do try to be helpful, even though I have only been playing 2 years, 
but I love doing quests, and am an avid tradeskiller [250 jeweler, 200 
everything except smithing 188, and tailoring 180] and I spend a lot of 
time researcing on Allah's, eqtrader and some class specific boards.
