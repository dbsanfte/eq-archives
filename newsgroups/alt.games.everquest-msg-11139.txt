Which is why having this discussion, in this forum is significantly more
productive than in one of the alt.religion/soc.religion Heirarchies. 
Its definitely OT, but we have no reason to turn to ranting and raving

recognizing that very little productive discussion occurs in those
groups.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
