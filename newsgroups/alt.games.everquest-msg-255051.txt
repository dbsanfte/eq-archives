Not true. There are NO directional AEs in the game. What there are is
targeted AEs with small ranges, which mimic directional AEs in that the
radius is generally smaller than the hit box of the mob. Ixibilat Fer in
Burning Woods for the cleric epic for example. His AE is Efreeti Fire, which
a lot of peole think is directional. It is not.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=985 Its targeted, and
the AE radius is only 30. 30 is smaller than the size of Ixi, so if you're
on the back of him and he AEs the main tank, you won't get hit.
