Welcome to EQ, and welcome to the newsgroup!

Relax and enjoy the ride. You will never "Win" at EQ. The fun in EQ is
the journey not the destination. The fastest way to level is to find
some people you enjoy grouping with, and that play durring the same
times that you do. The levels will come. Don't be in such a rush to
get them. he world of Norrath is huge. Take some time to see the sites
and smell the roses.

Cheers
