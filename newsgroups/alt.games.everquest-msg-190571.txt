    PHP is excellent at sql queries, and uses the same library as C
programs. However, that's a bit beside the point. Most  posters have said
"its too hard" which I think 90% of them are quite unqualified to say, but
most people have also said "I don't give a fuck" which is fine by me. If
nobody cares why should sony do anything about it?

    Last 10 sold should give accurate enough data to notice when a bat wing
goes for 10,000 plat.

    The above are ideas. I know they don't log everything everybody says. If
they did that I'm pretty sure they couldn't be setting up european servers
due to privacy laws...

    Do get most of that funcionality you don't have to log content of
messages, just who has spoken to who. No contact whatsoever and a 10k
exchange is a bit of a giveaway. But this is all moot if nobody give a fuck.

    Add at most a few things to logs and write a short analysis program
shouldn't equal a "large upfront cost" for a company that spends millions a
week. But..... I'm guessing the reason sony isn't doing anything about it is
that the playerbase doesn't care.
