Nothing in Toxx gives any cash to speak of. Get thyself into a lowbie group
in the warrens when you hit 7 or so... you should be able to handle the zone
entrance by then. Myself and a friend make up to 10 -16 pp apiece on  a good
night off the bronze and the clothing that drops in there from lvl 8 on up.

It's a dangerous zone though... frequent trains and a large variety of con
levels in a  small area, and since everything will be blue or above (mostly
above!) to you at lvl 7, a group is pretty much required. If no one else is
in the zone to help clear out the guards nearest the zone entrance it's
damned near impossible to solo in there at 7,  because you can't pull just
one of anything, and you probably won't be able to beat 2 of what you pull.
This is speaking from a young Wizards perspective though.... believe me, I
know :)
