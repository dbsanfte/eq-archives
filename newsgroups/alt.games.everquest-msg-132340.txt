Today, I've been e-mailing a friend back and forth at work.  Well, I
thought of something I wanted to tell him, so I hit "R".

Then, of course, this morning I was looking for my keys and I thought,
"lemme check my inventory."

~sigh~  Last night went badly, had 2 different guildies offer to PL me. 
Both times it ended up with me dead.  I would have been better off
sticking in a grind group.  I still think I might be able to pull it off
though.  I've got 48 hours from when I get off work to get 2 yellows and
5 levels.  If I can pull off a yellow an hour that gives me time to
catch up on sleep before the raid.


Thanks for all the advice guys. I just need to learn to follow it.
