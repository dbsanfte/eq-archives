"Am / Frenzy / Sage"

When a soloing pharmer replies with the above, can we ask them to give up
one of the camps so that another soloing pharmer or group can take it?

Can we ask this only if there are no other camps left in the zone? Or, can
we ask them to let one go even if, say, the supp camp spot is open, but we
fancy one of the Am / Frenzy / Sage?

Not to interested in hearing Verant's official rules on the matter. Just
would like to know what the unofficial "gentlemanly" rules state.

Thanks
