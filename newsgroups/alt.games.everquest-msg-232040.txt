i think it's fair to say that the proc frequency is shared between the
effect and the delay of the weapon, so the question of how often it procs
would mostly be answered by the weapon -- the guard II 1HB (blazing wand or
something or other) has a delay of 26 (boo) but still procs a good amount

it does seem like the guard proc is worth it for tanks, because it seems
like it stacks with regular mitigation (how / why couldn't it?)

i haven't tested this at high levels....the big question would be if it
stacks with the cleric's damage mitigation spells, because those seem
wonderful and guard is certainly not as good as that

and the 5% is nothing grand, but when you add in the 4% from natural warrior
mitigation, it seems to to make a difference .......i assume that with AA
mitigation added in (none of my chars have CS, so i can't test this) it
would really be something

supporting it,
