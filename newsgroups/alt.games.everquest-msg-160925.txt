}What's wrong with posting in HTML?

When you post in HTML, people with HTML-endabled newsreaders will see all 
your fancy HTML stuff.  Not all newsreaders are HTML enabled or even 
enableable, so everyone else will see a page full of gobbledygook.

Plus, it makes messages bigger, increasing bandwidth consumption for those 
who pay for such things.

Plus, it's a violation of local etiquette. It even says so in the FAQ, which 
I assume you read before posting.  Right?  No, then you would have noticed 
that it said not to top-post either.
