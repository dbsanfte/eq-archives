Interesting article and very easy to fix if Sony gave a damn.

1. All accounts to use credit cards.

2. Sony go onto the plat sales site and "buy" some platinum.  Turn up
in game to collect it and ban the account of the seller.

3. Trace back in the logs to see who gave that person the money to
trade.  Ban them or at very least watch them.

4. Do not let any credit card registerred to that person be used to
create new accounts.

5. Start logging any trades of cash for nothing or too much cash for
the item bought.

If they don't do something about this it will only get worse and be
exactly the same on EQ2.

Just my 2 cents.
