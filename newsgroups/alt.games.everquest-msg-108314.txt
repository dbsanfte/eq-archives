The flaw in his whole debate however is that he assumes every post prior to the
one being made is quoted but about 99% of the time there is only one prior post
quoted. That being the case then there is absolutely nothing wrong with top
posting except that it brings out all the anal retentive people that insist on
forcing their views and opinions on others rather than making a simple comment
expressing their opinion. I have no preference either way and have no trouble at
all following any thread. Some people I guess are a little slower than others or
need to have their world in perfect order. Hmmm that seems to be the definition
of anal retentive. =)
