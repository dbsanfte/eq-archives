But sadly, I play the game to have fun, and spending 90 minutes telling
other people how to play is not fun.

And I'm not even talking about me having an ego the size of Luclin and my
head stuck up my arse.  These were simple things - no one using /assist,
cleric getting hit, not being able to heal, but not saying anything at all
so no one else picked up healing or helped out, not waiting for me to calm
undead mobs before pulling rooms full of them, switching targets, running
around, etc.  Basic grouping stuff.

I didn't feel obliged to stick out the 90 minutes with them.  I left.  I
don't care about the 'leader board' (too much of an arcade game concept for
my liking) so I'm not worried about succeeding or failing missions, I just
want to enjoy attempting to succeed.
