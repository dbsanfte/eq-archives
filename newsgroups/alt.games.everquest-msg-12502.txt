Somebody else here posted something about not being able to imagine
playing EQ without all the maps and other web available information.  I
often think about what the game must have been like for the first
intrepid explorers who ventured out across Norrath for the first time. I
know we have people here who were around in the dark ages. he he he.
  Here's one that I really got to wondering about.  The freaking
werewolf talon that you need for the crafted armor BP......... once that
quest was discovered, I'm trying to imagine how many warriors were
camped out in WC and WK killing every poor werewolf that spawned, until
one day some Druid in Mistmoore kills a gypsy and /shouts "Anybody know
what this stupid werewolf talon is for?"
  Instantly you hear the thud of hundreds of warriors fainting dead away
and cursing Verant as they go down.
  I'm sure there were countless other massively frustrating examples of
quests that were almost unsolvable for some idiotic reason, or mobs that
you just couldn't seem to kill, or zones you just couldn't master.  Any
of you old timers care to share?
