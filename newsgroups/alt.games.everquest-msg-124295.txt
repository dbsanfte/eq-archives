Yep. A bit late. hehe

I thought it was just delay divided by damage for the ratio.

Thanks for the info.  One more question, though.

This is my first (highest) melee character.  I had heard that damage was
capped at 20 until level 20 but I'm hitting for 22 now.  When I hit 20, do I
get a good bonus?  I mean instead of hitting for twice+1 max will I hit for
like 3 times + 1?  Is there a good website I can read about this?  I'm a
member of Allakazam but haven't really seen good melee info.

Again, thanks.  I like having the AGI just cause I like seeing it so high. )
I just traded an agi+2 earring for a Tear of Karana (or Karana's tear)
STA+5.  Now my stats are STR 108, STA 100, AGI 125, DEX 95, WIS 62, INT 75
and CHA 75(I think).  I'm a half-elf also. I seem to do alright with the new
weapon.  At least I can hold my own against even cons again.
