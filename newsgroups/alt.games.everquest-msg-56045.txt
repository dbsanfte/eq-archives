Subject says it all. I think I can collect a bunch of that stuff myself
with my troll, and my necro is already tailoring away like mad, so
making the shadowsilk isn't out of the question. Those are three nice
items that others have reccomended, but if I can't MQ them, it's going
to be a Loooooong time before I can do those quests.
