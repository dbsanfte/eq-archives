This is not entirely accurate.

Cleric pets kill themselves whenever they don't have a target.  Thats 
"working as intended".  Cleric pets -get- targets in two ways; 1) 
whatever target cleric has when they are cast, 2) if a mob hits the 
cleric while pet is alive, pet will add that to target list, and get 
around to attacking it when their current target is dead (or next target 
  and so on if several mobs hit cleric)

1) is broken.  Thus, when cast cleric pets have no target selected
2) however, is working still.

Since it takes a cleric pet a few moments to figure out that it should 
kill itself, IF you can arrange to get hit after the cast finishes but 
before pet kills himself, then he'll acquire target and go to work.

Thus, its still possible to solo with the little buggers, with a little 
luck, but its really difficult to use them in groups as intended.

By the way, wizards have a similar pet, which is similarly broken (or so 
I hear) and mages have a similar pet, Rage of Zomm, which I can confirm 
is similarly broken.  Since the odds of a mage using a disposable pet 
instead of a perfectly good summoned one are vanishingly small, and 
wizards generally get more milage out of nukes than from this pet, its 
really only clerics who are suffering, and only clerics 54 to 60 at that.

Not a priority.

Splendid
