The bottom line is that firearm availability has a minor effect on
crime.  Prospective studies almost invariably show that increased gun
ownership is associated with decreased violent crime in local areas.
Broad retrospective studies have been mixed, but show decreasing effect
either way as the study groups become more closely matched in
demographics.  A classic example of the latter are the studies
comparing Canada and the US, where dramatic differences in violent
crime between Vancouver, BC and Vancouver, WA essentially disappeared
when matched between identical demographic cohorts.  Similarly, studies
comparing similar areas on the border between Canada and the US find no
relationship between gun ownership and crime rate.

The reason for this is that gun ownership has little to do with the
overall crime rate.  Britain's crime rate fell during the 90s, just as
did crime in the US because of age- and income-related demographic
effects.  Britain's crime rate has been rising, just as it has and will
in the US because of the same effects a mini-spike in young adult
demographics and economic woes.

Gun ownership *does* clearly affect *local* crime rates, as is shown by
Lott's work and other experiments of nature.  However, these effects
are generally overwhelmed in national statistics by events that have
nothing to do with gun ownership.

A good comparison between Britain and the US has been written 
by Jeremy Rabkin "Guns in the US and UK" in "The Public Interest,"
a review of "Guns and Violence: The English Experience" by Joyce
Lee Malcolm.
