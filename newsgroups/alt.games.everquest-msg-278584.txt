The "within reason" clause there is the killer.   I've seen
level 40 clerics sitting in Velks (pre-Luclin) at upper spiders
simply because CHeal was so overpowering.   I sure didn't
see level 40 shaman or druids there as the *only* healer in
the group.

Then again, I'm not aware of a game where everything is
balanced to the last point of hp healed or damage done.
It's certainly not in EQ2; not even close, except at the
lower levels where all the primary classes are using what
amounts to the same spells.   The branching doesn't really
begin to become pronounced until late 20's.
