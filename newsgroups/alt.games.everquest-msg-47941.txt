Im pretty convinced certain spells only drop in certain zones. Could be
wrong but that's my gut feeling :) Ive only ever seen certain mid-50s wizard
nukes drop in Howling Stones. Chardok seems awash with decent druid drops
that are hard to come by. Deep Sebilis is indeed best for high-50s drops
etc.
