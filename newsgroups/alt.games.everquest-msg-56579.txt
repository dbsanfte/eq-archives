He's got a program called EQhotkeys that will allow offline editing.
 Beware - editing my socials works fine for me, but if I then put that
social into a hotkey, I freeze up in-game when I use it.  So, try it once,
if it fails, do all your social editing offline, and position them into the
hotkey banks online.
