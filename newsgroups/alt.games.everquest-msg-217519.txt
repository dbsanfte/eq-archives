I'm nowhere near top of the line.  In fact I'm about as far away from
it as you can get and still play the game:

Celeron 333, Voodoo 3, 128MB RAM, no sound.

I don't even bother extending the clip plane that far out even in
old-world outdoor zones.  But it doesn't make the game unplayable.
The rounded surfaces and realism in some of the newer zones puts the
angular Old-world and Kunark zones to shame.  It feels like two
different games.
