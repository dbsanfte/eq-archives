Well, actually, I might have a spare... The shipping charge would be 
_insane_, though.  It exceeds my lifting capacity, and I don't give up 
easy. :) Your best bet is to go to the nearest University and find out 
what they do with old, out of date computers.  At my U, they have a place 
called the bargain barn.  These things tend to turn up there eventually.

If you can, get an Alpha, of course.  And just remember... Nothing sucks 
like a VAX. :)
