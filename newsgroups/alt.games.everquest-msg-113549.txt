Not everybody is like it though - I was once just unable to save a character
as I hit lag while trying to cast a heal spell on them, and when they came
and got their corpse they thanked me for trying to help - so I buffed and
sowed them and even helped them power level for a time then I sent them on
their way, but on the other hand I have been sitting down medding and people
have still expected me to jump up and save them getting rather ratty that I
just sat there and didn't heal (even though I have tried to explain to them
that I would have healed but I was OOM). The problem is that there have been
many of the moaning players and few of the grateful ones.
