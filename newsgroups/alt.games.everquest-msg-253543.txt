Aye, melee can bind in Arena, so can I.

BUT Arena is out on the far end of LRathe, so I'd gate there, then run 
back across the lake, zone in to RM, then run to the inn and sell, then 
run back to HG.

I bet that would take me longer than running from HG to the inn and 
back, and it wouldnt' kill my ability to leave when I wanted by gating 
to POK.

Its also probably the same distance as gating to POK to sell, then using 
book to Ogguk (Feerrot) running to RM and then to HG.

Splendid
