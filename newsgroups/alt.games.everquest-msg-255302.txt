I don't think you need an actual trap to practice this skill.  (Caveat, 
its been a long time, and I could be remembering wrong or this may have 
been changed)  I'm pretty sure my bard just tied the skills to his turn 
arrows so they would go off every time they cycled, and got plenty of 
skill ups that way with absolutely no effort (this is the same trick we 
all used to use to cap out Sense Heading, and that my monk used to cap 
out Mend, and so on)

I find the LDoN traps to be a nuisance, and deadly sometimes when I've 
died and am running a caster back in naked to rejoin the group; trip a 
trap that was a chuckle when buffed and geared and near the healers, and 
its suddenly a race to get to the group before I die... a race my mage 
lost on more than one occaision.
