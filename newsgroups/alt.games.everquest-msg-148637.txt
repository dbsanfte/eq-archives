Okay, my little wizard, she's now 31 (whee!).

She specialized in Evocation, but it is still twinged on 50.  It has not
gone up.

Of the Specialization, Evocation is the ONLY one she trained in.

In order for Evocation to go up, do I have to train her in the other four
fields as well or ??

TIA,
  -- Chari, XEV

PS:  Darn research!  How do I find the right runes for what I need? (more
searching for runes she doesn't have)
