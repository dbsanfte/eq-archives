Not bad.  Hadn't thought of that one.

Nah.  Sit is more taunt than proximity.  The reason sitting doesn't help
though, as you pointed out below, is that the second you stand up again the
sit aggro goes away.  And trying to tank something by repeatedly sitting is
about the stupidest thing I can imagine.  Every hit on a sitting person
lands, and lands for the mob's max melee damage.  Against anything that
needs a tank, you'd die quickly.
