Wow, I just made a bard on my second account and didn't even know there was
an icon.

The stupid part is I play next to my buddy who has a lvl 54 bard.  He's
kinda coaching me and I never even once thought to ask him if there was an
icon.

I *do* have my song spells window closed... does it perhaps filter into
there?
