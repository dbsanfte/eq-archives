Yes haste works from level 1. This is what sets this weapon above all the
other 2hders in the 1k and under bracket.

This has never been proved (that I know of) but I believe it does. When the
Mith finally fell from grace and dropped under 2k I picked up one for my
warrior (high 30's) and one for my SK (low 20's) I wanted to find out the
actual delay so I started timing swings with a stop watch (yup, anal..I
know) anyway, while my warrior appeared to be wielding a 21/31 weapon (which
most will tell you it is with the haste effect) my SK seemed to be wielding
a 21/36 weapon. This wasn't just lag or my reactions as I did this over and
over with the same results. I believe that the full effect doesn't come in
till 30th but this is my experience alone and I have never heard anyone else
say anything similar about the sword.

The mith 2hder cost me 1500 for my warrior (1k for my SK's) the next upgrade
was 8k for Felhammer, I wouldn't bother with any other 2hder after the Mith
until you are looking at something around 30dam 40del range (or better) and
about 6 times the price of a Mith 2hder.

CF
Basically, damage wise, you'll not want another 2hder for at least 12
levels, prolly more.
