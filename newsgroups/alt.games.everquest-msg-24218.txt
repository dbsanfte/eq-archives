No, it has nothing to do with uber.
It has to do with Velious.  Verant fucked up royally.  Which would you
rather have as a druid:

Verm Tunic:  15 AC, +9 Str, +9 Sta, +13 Wis, +35 HP

Or 

Crystal Chitin Chestguard:  25 AC, +7 Agi, +10 Wis, +7 Cha, +10 Mana

Or

Rowly's Chestguard of Nature:  20 AC, +5 Str, +14 Wis, +4 Cha, +7
vsMg, +5 vsCold, +5 vsDis, +30 HP, +80 Mana.

Ask me which is "harder" to get.

Two groups can farm Kael arena.
Broodmother can be done with one group, two if they are under level
55.

Rarity, looks and stats makes the Verm Tunic absolute shit.

The same thing is happening for each class.  Anyone that goes to Fear
for armor drop needs to get their heads examined.  The drop rate
stinks, the time commitment required is sick and the resulting item IF
you're very lucky is subpar to anything you can obtain with 1/4 the
effort and time in Velious.

Look at the stats of the above.
Then look at what is required to kill each.  Go and determine on your
own which is worth your time and which isn't.

I cannot imagine any druid that would actually want to wear the Verm
tunic over the other two.

Actually, given the ridiculously overpowered weapons that are being
found in Velious, places like Fear/Hate because of the relative
scarcity of dipshits forming train, you can get more exp per hour than
other zones.

Back when the best tank weapon was a SSoY (8/24) and 1000AC was very
rare to break, Fear mobs had "too many" hitpoints.  When a freaking
*TWINK* can run around with Lamentations (9/19) and RFV while main
tanks are weilding 12/18 weapons and can trivially hit 1200AC, Fear
mobs are "gimpy".
