What a completely immoral position to take.  George W. Bush makes a
big, giant, disasterous mess in Iraq, and you think we should just
abandon the country now?

I like Kerry's position better: it was a mistake to approach Iraq the
way we did, but now that the mess is made, we've got to clean it up.
George W. Bush is demonstrating that he doesn't know how to clean it
up.  He has no fresh ideas except "more of the same".  We've seen how
good "more of the same" is working...  It's NOT working.

Personally, I support our troops, and don't want them to keep dying
needlessly because our current president is a simpleton.  In my
opinion, you logically can't support our troops and George W. Bush at
the same time: they're mutually exclusive.
