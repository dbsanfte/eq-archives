you must be joking, or you are tuned in to some vastly
different dwarf model than the one I'm looking at.

No, wait, I remember when I first logged in, in my underwear
since I'd been unable to get a boat out to OOT to loot up.
Yep, as I recall, male dwarf didn't look half bad.

On the other hand, my admittedly missmash armor looks
abyssimal on me.  Froglock chestplate?  Used to be a
handsome deep green "muscle Tshirt" look, now its aquamarine
and prompted my wife, looking over my shoulder, to comment
"nice dress..."  and we are renaissance workers, the idea
of a tunic isn't lost on us!  Donals arms jut out about three times
my bicep size, overall I look like some Games Workshop nightmare
dwarf model painted by a blue/green colorblind ten year old
wargamer.

I was not at all naked when I was dead.  Male Dwarf, that is,
certainly had pants, shirt, even boots on.  Vah Shir characters,
male and female, are both also sporting a solid set of sportswear
when actually naked... as anyone who's been hanging out in
Shar Val can tell you, the place is swarming with them.  I bought
myself a full set of Padded Leather, and I think I was the only
dressed cat in the whole zone yesterday.

Every time I zone or log out, one or another piece of my character
model changes... hair color, beard color, hairstyle... I don't even
look to see if my eyes and face are remaining stable, just try to hang
on to the long red hair and matching beard.

I suppose those are the "social animations?"  SInce I have 'only'
384 megs of memory, the system reccomended I turn em off.  Since
I bought this bloody machine about a month ago, I imagine I'll be
able to slip a "need" to upgrade past my wife by about the year
2004...

First person I've heard from that prefered the new skeletons. Wolves,
now, seem to be prefered 3 to 1.
