    You wanted something they feel should be limited in numbers on all
servers. That was your crime.

    What gets me is, McQuaid reads the newsgroup. I imagine he might even
cruise server-specific boards if he gets time. He KNOWS the horror stories.
He KNOWS how brutal this is, not just for the cleric, but for the cleric's
friends and the cleric's guild. Every server has at least one story of
massive conflict that extends well after the Ragefire incident, or massive
tragedy (our server, where Ragefire fell INTO THE WALL after a 60 hour
camp - so sorry, start over). And yet they still cling to the idea that the
number of res sticks should be limited or the game will be horribly broken.

    The game is broken with them, but not in the way VI thinks. The
sprinkler is a REQUIREMENT for membership in top guilds - try and tell a
guild that you intend to never get yours, and see what they say in response.
The number of people backlogged will NEVER decrease - with two coming into
being per week, and with roughly one in seven high-level players having to
be clerics, the number of new epic-capable clerics is outpacing the number
of clerics leaving the queue. The conflicts this quest is causing are
customer service nightmares - on my server, /who all son of a bitch returns
the guild that had Rage fall into the wall, they tellbombed the GM so badly.
On other servers, Rage conflicts have led to training after training in an
effort to "get even". The sprinkler has caused about as much high-end
conflict as Venril Sathir ever did.

    Change it. Make Rage a standard turn-in triggered spawn, and change
something else to compensate. Make Rage tougher than the General. Make other
steps tougher. Nerf the right-click res to the level 49 spell. Make the
sprinkler unable to be activated until level 56. Something. Anything.
Please.

    James
