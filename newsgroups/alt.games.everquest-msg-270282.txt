About the consensus here? I haven't seen it. As for the website, given
some obscure site I've never heard of, I'm not going to take its word.
Seriously, takes more than one website and rantings in some newsgroups
to be able to make such a declarative statement about soloability of a
game. Usenet and web forums both tend to attract...well, very vocal
complainers. You'll hear more from those who have issues with a game
than from those who are content with it, even if the ones with
problems are in the minority.

I don't have personal experience beyond 20, so I can't comment on the
soloability. I do hear of people soloing just fine after 20, though.

Going by forum/newsgroup consensus, my SG-mates in CoH are an
impossibility... a Mind Controller and an Earth/Storm Controller who
have both soloed into their upper 30's so far, in spite of claims of
these two builds being un-soloable beyond newbie levels.
