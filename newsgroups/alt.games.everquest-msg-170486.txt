    You were outside both aggro radius, and assist radius. The kobold you
were fighting was in the awareness radius of the shaman, though, and in
healing range so it got healed. Awareness radius is an odd thing - it
measures whether a mob knows you're there. Normally, it's used for mobs
buffing other mobs. Sometimes it's a bit more sinister - Cazic Thule has an
awareness radius that covers all of Fear. So if he gained aggro on you
(passed on from another mob), since Death Touch has enough range to hit
anything in PoF, he would death touch you (back when he had DT). You can see
awareness at work when mobs turn to look at you when you haven't done
anything to aggro them - that shows they're aware of you.
