If you want to make the best money, hunt non-xp stuff (like spiders & cats &
bears, oh my!) and sell that stuff in bazaar.

But for a decent amount of both xp and loot, SolA (Solusek's Eye), SolB
(Nagafen's Lair) off of Lavastorm (if you zone in and everything is non-KOS
that would be Temple of Sol Ro...you DO NOT want to hunt there <g> ) are
both good bets.

SolA: goblins drop fine steel.  There's also some very nice loot in the zone
if you know where it is.  However, at 34 you're not going to be able to solo
anything except maybe the Bartender.  You'll want the southern end of the
zone.  Proceed with caution but you should be able to do pretty well.

SolB: kobolds also drop fine steel.  The cash isn't too bad either.
Experience is VERY GOOD.  You'll need to hunt by a zone line (I believe
there are 5) because it's easy to get overwhelmed unless you're seriously
twinked (and even then!).  What I usually did to break a room was aggro them
all, run just next to the zone line and snare one once he gets near the zone
line.  Zone out, heal, then zone back in and the one you snared should be
right there all alone.  Obviously you'll want root memmed. :)

Upper Guk:  you'll want to hunt pretty deep to get the dark blue froggies
which means that you'll need to know the zone.  I wouldn't recommend it if
you don't.

Lower Guk:  similar tactics to SolB but much harder to get to unless you
know Upper Guk.

Droga: have lesser evac ready and be prepared to eat xp losses when you die.
This zone is in the NW area of Frontier Mountains.  Experience is excellent,
and so are the drops.  Keep the Mt Death Mineral Salts and Green Goblin
Skins (I think that's what the skins are called).  You should be able to
make a mint selling these in Bazaar to people who want to get Chardok
faction up.  Opals drop with some regularity, as does fine steel, decent
cash, and occasional good loot.  DO NOT GET COCKY...this zone is deadly if
you do.  It's very safe if you play it safe but if you get impatient....

Good news is that nothing from the zone in to the zone out sees through
invis.  Bad news is that I've yet to find a good map and once you drop
through the fake floor near the zone in, the only ways out are gate, die, or
run about 2 minutes (a long time) to the zone out.  Good news is that once
you know how to get to the zone out you shouldn't have any trouble finding
it again. :)
