  If you gave Anarchy Online a chance you might discover the actual play 
of the game is good and fun. And if you did, you could then perhaps feel 
it worthwhile to spring for the expansions which as far as I know bring 
the graphics up to date. Of course then you'd have to pay the monthly 
fee but it would be worth it if you discovered you liked the game. I'd 
suggest giving it a try and realizing that how it looks for free is not 
the same as how it looks if you like it enought to pay for it.

I know EverQuest doesn't look nearly so good as EverQuest II but the 
game is so much fun to play I really don't care and it isn't like it 
looks horrible by any stretch. And at least I can log in and play 
anytime. And by the way, it may not always be true but in my experience 
when the servers were down for scheduled maintainence, which was never 
during primetime hours, I could always log into the test server, make a 
toon, testbuff them to level 25 with level appropriate gear and go LDoN 
with them or something. It's a pretty fun way to try out a class you 
know nothing about a few levels up and see what they play like. Of 
course, a good number of the other 25s don't know what they are doing 
either but it's all good fun when the regular world isn't available.
