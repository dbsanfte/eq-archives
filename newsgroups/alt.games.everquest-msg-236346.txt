A gm, if he witnessed it, would probably issue a warning on your
account. However, if you're smart, you wouldn't do it long enough for a
gm to show up to witness it and you wouldn't send any tells that could
be /reported. As getting a gm to respond is probably going to take at
least an hour, you're probably safe dispelling the mobs for a good 30-45
min which might be enough time to convince the morons to move someplace
else.

Not that I'd do it or anything.
