All,

   I have been using NetZero Platinum and it kicks me off of EverQuest
every 3 hours.  I think the everquest packets are pretty consistent
and so NetZero improperly sees me as idle?  So, is there an idle bot
that I can use that alters my signature to NetZero and does not cause
significant distrubtion to the game.  I do not want to use a bot that
fires every 10 min and causes horrible EQ lag.  A Bot that fires every
2 hours and 45 minutes and only causes minimal traffic and lag would
be great.  If there is no bot out there can some high speed programmer
out there make one?  Thanks in advance.

Todd DeLong
