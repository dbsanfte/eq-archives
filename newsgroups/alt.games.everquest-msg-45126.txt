>>>SNIP<<<
>>What do people think is to be accomplished by this... that maybe... just
<maybe> THEY will be the level 44 to kill Firiona and go down in history or
something?<<

Knowing the mentality of most "l33t d00ds" , their thought process probably
goes like this:

1) Fironia is a GM character
2) GM characters have xtreme uber loot. It's like a law or sumthin.
3) Kill Fironia, get xtreme uber loot.

I think that's the same reason that one guild killed Tunare - Gods must have
xtreme uber loot, right?
