I can honestly say that it ISNT stupid.  It isnt for me to judge what
is important to others.  I honestly know people who have had as much
as $5,000 sunk into an entertainment center  yet have minimal
furniture (yes, Milk Crates and plywood for a coffee table) as a
result and take the bus to work because the money they are spending
for the payments on the EC keep them from affording a car and
insurance.

It is about what is important to you.  For some, it will be worth it
to save every penny to get a horse.  Just to HAVE a horse.  The
enchantress I mentioned would want one even if there were NO special
abilities.  And would still save the 8k it will cost her.  Just
because she WANTS a horse.

Me?  I have the money and could care less about one=)
