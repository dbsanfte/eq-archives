I wanted to be sure on this point, because my understanding was that a
pet's delay was always 30, regardless of what weapon you give them.
Therefore, it was my understanding that it was beneficial to always
give them a 2h weapon for the higher damage rating. For that reason,
though I am still new at the pet classes, I always make it a point to
try and give Mr. Bones a 2h weapon.
