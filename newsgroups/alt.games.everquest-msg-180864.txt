    Sony will do nothing. Yantis has been selling plat for a long time now,
in easy-to-trace amounts, and nothing has happened to him. Who do you think
sells him all the plat he sells? He doesn't farm it himself. It's from
people like the guild leaders of TR, and they don't get busted either.

    Here's how ineffectual the whole EULA is. I petitioned a fellow player
as being purchased on E-Bay recently. I provided the GMs with the
approximate date of the transaction (the fellow changed the last name of the
new character to that of his old character shortly after the purchase). I
gave them the full RL name of both the original owner of the account, and
the full RL name and address of the new owner so they could double-check the
change of account info. I told them the name of a character on the new
owner's old account, so they could verify the IP switch on the transaction
date. When asked how I knew about the switch, I told them how I had members
of the original owner's guild in my guild. How the original had posted to a
public board about the transaction. How the new owner had posted both to a
server board and to his own guild board about the transaction, and his name
and address were obtained from the whois on his guild's board (he had posted
in another thread there about owning the board). The GMs had every piece of
information necessary to justify looking at IP records and account info to
prove the assertion and get the account yanked.

    Nothing's happened. An account that by everything in the EULA should be
*banned* is still being played.

    You know what the sad part is? I told the GM-Admin that I was talking
to, "If I see that action can be taken when specific information is provided
I'll help you root out more E-Bay'ed accounts." And it's quite true. I could
tell them the player names of at least three accounts listed on
Playerauctions right now, so they could catch them as soon as they sold. I'd
be surprised if I couldn't give them info on at least a dozen accounts that
have changed hands, info good enough to pinpoint the transaction dates and
verify the change of account info/IP that is the sign of a sold account.
Hell, I bet I could trace plat sales on my server right to the source if
they asked me to look into it. But they don't care, because getting rid of
these people doesn't make them money and wastes their time. If they won't
act on information provided by someone with a spotless CS record AND a
soulmark for helping the GMs locate and stop the exploitation of a "safe
spot", what does it take?

    Dark Tyger - you're perhaps the most ardent defender of VI, SOE and the
EULA on this board. You defend them to the point that I've wondered at times
if you work for them! How much importance do you think the GMs place on the
EULA now? What's more hypocritical: the player that ignores the agreement to
which he clicks "YES" when he sells his account, or the people who have said
they'll enforce that agreement and do not do so?

    James
