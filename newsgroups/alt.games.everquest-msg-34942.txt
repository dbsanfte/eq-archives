Sign up with SWBell/SWHell DS(hel)L services and you wont have to worry
about NOT being charged for services you DO have.  Its actually the other
way around.  You won't have to worry about being charged for services you
don't have because that's just a given fact that you will.  Don't worry
though, they'll get it corrected....tomorrow.  After October 2000-June 2001
being charged and credited back all months (well, charged all months,
credited back most of them) they finally quit charging me for DSL.  I got my
July 2001 phone bill and I was right, no DSL charges....4 dialup ISP charges
at $21.95 each for the same account for the same month (actually was one
single charge worth the normal amount followed by another single charge
worth 3 times the amount).  After speaking to a supervisor (again) I "think"
I have finally got it fixed.  They did tell me they killed the account this
time (they just "forgot" to back in October).  One month I was charged for 2
DSL lines at the same time.  So according to the information I've read on
how DSL works, I was using 196% of the possible bandwidth that the phone
line has the ability to carry, and I was doing this by using 6 of the 4
existing wires in the line.
    Now I've been using COX cable since (hey, cable modem is twice upload
and download ability anyway, and I've actually watched myself using a news
reader and downloading from binaries news groups from a server that doesn't
cap speeds (it may at about a T-1 or higher but the cap what ever or if it
is happens to be high enough for cable modem users not to notice).  One
point I maxed out my hardware's abilities.  Was just slightly over 3.00
Mbits/sec.  Only problem I've had with COX is when I moved they had to make
me a new account, and caused a minor problem there.  Yes billing problems,
but not with charges or payments.  They've threatened me with cutting off
services on that disconnected account.  I didn't mind at first (just seeing
how obviously a computer is the only thing looking at this picture here, any
human or thing with any form of intelligence would see the problem with
cutting off disconnected services).  The time I had to speak to a supervisor
was when they threatened to send me to their collections department for not
paying the $0.00 due on that account.  Turned out that it was being looked
at as something like I have an active account, and that other account hasn't
received a payment in a few months, and because the one account is active it
must be too right?
    Isn't artificial intelligence a wonderful thing?  Without it we'd have
allot less stupid things to laugh at.

(go ahead, ignore that I'm being a good customer and not having payment
problems with my active account...cut off services on that disconnected
account...then tell your collections department that I need to pay up on
that $0.00 amount due.)
