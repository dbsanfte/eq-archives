I don't recall you ever making any statements that implied you
beleived it was all about context. All I recall is you coming up with
some half-assed stupid reach for how one of my characters' names could
be against the rules.

Someone *ELSE* can't change the context of *MY* name. There is nothing
about my character to imply that any referrence to terrorism was
intended.

I didn't say "Charles Monsoon, Chuck Manson", etc. I said "Charles".
Period. Your arguments about my name are no stronger than a character
simply named "Charles" being against the rules.

Now that I know what it means, it's not "OK" to me. The name is a
direct, exact referrence to the character in another language that is
one of the most widely known aside from English in the US, not a
desperate stretch like your arguments about mine were.
