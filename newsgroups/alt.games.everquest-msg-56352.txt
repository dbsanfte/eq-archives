I think thats a very good point.  Excluding my guilds 60 warriors, the next
highest tanks are 2 56 warriors, and neither can hold agro from me.  (I know
this isn't level for level...) but Im sure my AC is higher,  my skills
(dodge, riposte, block) are a damn sight higher too, and as long as my
clerics chealing me and not trying to divine light me every 5 seconds, mana
is rarely a problem.

I did a group in DN back at 59, was an interesting combo. 59 monk, 52monk,
60 druid, 58 druid, 57 chanter, 60 rogue.  No tank (i was MA) no cleric (1
druid on heals, other epicing and stuff) and we kicked ass with the (i
forgot the ashbone drakes names in DN..) and spiders/rats etc.
