If you want to try and dig it up, there's an old thread on the
crucible with some parses and links to other boards that also did
testing. 

Basically what it came down to is that CA3 gave you a 10% reduction in
hits, LR5 only brought it up to 15%. In other words, if you normally
get hit 60% of the time by a mob, CA3 would drop that to 54% and LR5
would drop it to 51%. 

CS/ID had the same affect on average damage taken. CA3 dropped it by
10% and ID5 increased that to 15%. Max damage stayed the same in both
cases, just your average was reduced. 

From what I recall, CA3 had a hidden advantage over CS3 in that a mob
will only proc on a hit so CA3 also reduced a mob's proc rate while
CS3 didn't affect that.
