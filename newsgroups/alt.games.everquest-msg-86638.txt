I wanted to see the Fairy city in Lesser Fay when I was a young
chanter, and I came across a interesting thing.

"Hail, A Brownie Scout!"  

Root! Boom! Sizzle!

I'd only been playing for a few weeks. I lost two more corpses on CR.
I just went out and bought a new robe.

Later, I had no problem finding the brownie city where I had to buy to
Mana thickening spells. I knew where it was.

Officially those wern't my last words, I had a words I spoke after
that but couldn't type over "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT"
