Speaking as a roleplayer, I find every time I junk a character and start 
a new one, I identify with the new one less.  Your first character, poor 
choices and all, makes the best "roleplay" IMO, because life doesn't let 
you go back and change everything about yourself; you have to work 
forward instead.

If I were a rabid roleplayer planning on being a rabid EQ2 player, I'd 
be wanting to start on day one of release and keep that character forever.

Of course I'm not -that- much of a roleplayer, more RP lite, and my 
first EQ character, a level 4 gnome wizard, was abandoned after just a 
couple days play when I figured out that wizards suck in EQ... and now 
I'm on my what, 27th character?

One thing still nags me though, and its entirely possible that if I do 
start playin EQ again, it will be as Pente, gnome wizard, and as close 
as I can recall to the original's stats.  Poor guy, unfinished business 
you know.

Grage, ne Pente
