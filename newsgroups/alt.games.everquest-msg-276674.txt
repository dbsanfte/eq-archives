One other thing, my new PC will have a gig of ram and maybe running two 
instances of EQ and switching windows would be doable on it. It's got a fast 
video card and is a P4 3.2 so it might perform well enough to multitask two 
instances of EQ. Maybe that is the simplest solution if it works well. Any 
thoughts on doing that anyone? The video card is a ATI Radeon X800-XL with 
256 MB RAM and in performance testing I have seen on Tom's hardware and 
elsewhere appears to me to basically a second tier down from the top end of 
cards today. But it is much, much faster than the NVidia FX-5600 in the P4 
2.2 box with 512 MB RAM I have now and am upgrading from.
