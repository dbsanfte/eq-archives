not entirely true - snakes on mobile phones is now a dying fad, but when
mobile first peaked *everyone* was playing it - and it certainly wasn't
coz the graphics were really cool...


pong is just as playable now as it has always been, only a few games
have ever rivaled the hecticness of missile command, many people
consider mario kart on the snes to be far better than mario kart on the
n64, golden sun on the gba is doing brilliantly despite not being able
to rival the graphics of something like FFX...


graphics are just as way or portraying the medium of the gameplay - it
don't matter if you use complex 3D models or simple 4 colour icons, the
game underneath is the same...
