<jshaw@stny.rr.com> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

I'm sorry you decided to run rather than debate, Jazz. I think if you
could actually answer the questions with an open mind you would
finally see my argument. Well there's always the other post.

Ignoring the points doesn't make them go away, Jazz.

Ah yes, the huge mass of others. Numbering three people. Two of which
probably just havent come online yet. Your idea that you are supported
by the massees, Jazz, is not born out by the evidence. Actually, Jazz,
you'll find most people in this thread disagreed with you, if that
actually meant anything.


>a) incapable of accepting any opinion other than your own

Incorrect, Jazz, since I am perfectly capable of accepting others'
opinions.


>b) and egomaniac beyond the dreams of most, since the *only* things you

>(opinion, stated as fact)

That is not my opinion, that is the opinion of the vast majority of
MMORPG players, Jazz. Of course you can ask if I've counted them, and
know I'll say no, but you know it, and I know it, and everyone here
knows it.

I will challange you to find one post (besides this thread) that has
ever shown the spellbook in a positive light. Please, show me this
person and their reasoning. You have all of google at your disposal.
I'm eagerly waiting, Jazz.

>(proclamation that "rites of passage" have no value because Ben doesn't
>believe in them.)

No, because you didn't support it with any positives, Jazz. You just
declared your opinion and then used it as evidence of the patch being
bad. I'm sorry if you don't understand how debates work, Jazz, but
one's opinion is only as good as the evidence used to defend it, and
you don't defend yours at all. Besides "I had to do it, so should
others to be in my league", of course.

Irrelevant, Jazz, because the amount of experience for the set of
levels hasn't changed.

You make it sound like people quitting is a good thing, Jazz. /sigh


>c) incapable of reading what's actually read and responding to it,
>instead of responding to something that you wish had been said.

Incorrect, Jazz, I am perfectly capable of reading what's actually
said, as this thread shows.

No, its not, Jazz. I'll remind you that you began the insulting first.
If you can't take the heat, don't crank the thermostat.

This is all just yet more evidence that you don't understand the
argument. Ignorance is not a valid excuse to dismiss an argument,
Jazz.

Did you enjoy having the spellbook with your lowbies, Jazz? Did it add
more to the game than not having it would?

I note you refused to answer that question, Jazz. I am not surprised.


> Your faint, child-like cries of

If I was such a poor debate partner, Jazz, you wouldn't be running
with your tail between your legs.

An invariable truth - the one who feels the need to diss the other
person's debating skills is the one who just got whipped. Not that I
care to do so, but I *do* find it amusing when someone tries one of
the oldest flames on usenet. :-)
