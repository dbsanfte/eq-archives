Hi, does anyone know what ports DAOC uses ? I ask this because I
connect to my ISP via a proxyserver and it blocks all ports under
1024. I would really like to try out this game, but it is a bit insane
to order it now in the US (I live in Belgium) as long as I haven't got
this info.
I play EQ and Asheron's Call (quit AC long tile ago, still play EQ,
but i need something new)  fine with my ISP, but Anarchy Online (I
didn't tried it myself) gave problems because port 80 was used i
believe. So if anyone can provide me with the info I would be very
grateful. I cannot call to the US help-/infodesk of DAOC myself
because my parents would kill me lol. I emailed them, but haven't
received any info yet.
If someone can make a local call to the helpdesk with this question
would be even more wonderful. I don't ask any of you to spend money on
a call, i dont even know if it is a pay number. I dont know the phone
system in the US.

Anyway thanks in advance, and please excuse me for my English. I speak
Dutch at home and can't wait to try out this game.

sincerely

Vumuur
