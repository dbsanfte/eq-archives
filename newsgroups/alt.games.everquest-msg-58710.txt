  I know next to nothing about DAoC, but don't dismiss all PvP games because
the way one game you've played in the past poorly handled PvP.  :)  That
would be like giving up RPGs in general because the first one you ever
played was lousy.

  The idea of PvP itself doesn't turn me off, but if a game isn't designed
for PvP and the ruleset is particularly open to abuse, it can be a recipe
for disaster.
