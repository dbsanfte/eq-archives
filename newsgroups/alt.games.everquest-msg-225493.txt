Not only did I die and one other... two groups died, about 8 people, as 
the other 4 were high level and got summoned out to the lavastorm 
entrance when Naggy spotted them.  We had a giantclear chat channel and 
much of the chatter about that incedent went on there, as opposed to in 
raid.  I was gratified to see nobody complaining about the deaths, just 
took it in stride; this is the hallmark of a mature player... on a raid, 
expect deaths.

Sitting down to mem a spell would probably have been a mistake, after 
multiple resists there's every chance this would have pissed Naggy off 
enough for him to turn and make a snack out of you.  While thats all 
well and good, death is frequently your reward for going on a raid, it 
would also mean moving him around, disrupting the tanking effort, 
healing effort, nuking effort (the tiny little casting box moving 
around) and the melee dps effort, particularly the rogue part, as the 
"back" area moves around.  Not that a dozen other people didn't get 
aggro when they shouldn't, but here's a chance to learn from something 
you didn't get around to doing but meant to!

With all the misery of a raid, when you take down a big target for the 
first time, there's nothing to beat the rush.  The problem, for me, 
comes when you do a target over and over, and he becomes dead easy, 
routine.  Then all the misery and wasted time magnifies in your head, 
while the heady thrill of defeating the big bugaboo shrinks.  Naggy and 
Vox are unique targets for me because I doubt I'll ever do them more 
than once, if that often, and because for most people in the raid, its 
their first time.. .which means it can be the worst sort of raid ever 
with people who don't know their place, don't understand when the buffs 
are coming, don't know what to do or how to do it... and all this 
challenge just makes victory the sweeter.

IF at 65 you are ever in a raid with people acting this badly, you'll be 
tearing your hair out.  Here...well they did better than I've ever seen 
this done, outside of a regular guild vox killing effort where we did 
the lady almost nightly getting drops for epics (back during a run of 
patch days)
