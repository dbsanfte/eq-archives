I currently made an iksar shammy to compliment my iksar monk on my other
account after recommendations for this newsgroup and it's been awesome.
They shammy has some nice slows and debuffs, as well as sow, agi, dex buffs
for the monk which just kicks a$$ =)

Anyway, the shammy is almost naked.  He is currently 20 and my monk just
dinged 30.  I like the Jaundice Bone gear for shammys but IIRC Iksars cannot
wear this plate armor =(  Any other recommendations for some shammys out
there?  If you have a Magelo profile that would be awesome too.

TIA, Danny
