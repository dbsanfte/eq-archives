There's no such item unless Naggy's loot table changed while I wasn't
paying attention.

The stats are that of Mith Torque--a neck slot item.  Pretty crappy
even for a neck piece unless you're a WIS caster.  I'm almost certain
it's not usable by a cleric.  I think the default choice on these USED
to be paladins/rangers/SKs and bards.

These days the default choice is "BANK" class followed closely by the
"ROT" class.

Any warrior that actually uses this today with Velious loot available,
needs to get his head examined.  Both the rygor and spider fur is much
better than this and probably easier to obtain now that Velk is LGuk
part 3.
