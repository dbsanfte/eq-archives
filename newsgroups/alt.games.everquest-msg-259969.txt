In the eternal game of "let's copy what other mmorpgs did that people
like" EQ1 has a "task" system similar to WoW quests in the next
expansion, with some differences that make them play differently (for
one thing as far as I can tell there's a *lot* of them, which means
you won't run out of "tasks" in an area like you do with WoW quests,
however the drawback is they aren't as integrated with the world as
WoW's are, mainly because EQ1 stopped trying to be a world back at
Luclin). If EQ1 can do it, EQ2 will be able to do it as well.

Seems to me that level range is fairly forgiving, judging from the
people I've seen in the troll caves and other minidungeons.
