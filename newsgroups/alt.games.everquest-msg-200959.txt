Just because you are able to find differences, does not make my analogy 
is incorrect. According to your way of thinking, stealing a tomato from 
my garden would not be comparable to stealing a candy bar from the 
grocery store. After all, one is a garden, one is a store. One is a 
vegetable, one is junk food. You're right. What was *I* thinking.

Furthermore, it was more a point of reference than an analogy in this 
case. I was referring to another post where I used pirating MP3's and 
such as an analogy. Here, I am merely pointing out a point of fact 
supported by my own observations. As I said, the pro-KEI-for-lower-levels 
crowd is comprised largely of people who have no trouble doing something 
in their own interests regardless of the ramifications on the bigger 
picture.

Say what you want. I see that attitude all over. It's a fucking epidemic.
