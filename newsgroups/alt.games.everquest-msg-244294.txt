All poison is player made. If you go to the component vendors in PoK,
you can often find poison that people made and then sold back to the
vendors.

It's probably something you can wait a while on. My rogue was level 62
before I bothered making a serious effort at it.

OTOH, you can plan your hunting grounds based on where poison
components drop in order to make progress as you go.

You need a piercer in your main hand to backstab. In the later game,
good piercers are few, far between, and expensive. You're not too late
to put a fast, decent 1hs in your off-hand and start skilling up. You
should max out somewhere around level 47 if you do that.
