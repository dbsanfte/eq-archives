    Assumed level 60 for calculations. Assumed STA not at cap with
Brute/Boar. MANA calculation done for the case where WIS isn't capped, but
is over 200 (when you don't have KEI).

    HP difference between Aegis and Shroud: 12x3 + 90 = 126 HPs.
    MANA difference between Aegis and Shroud: 90 - (10-8)x2 = 78 MANA.

    That's about as massive an improvement as one piece of gear can give
you, short of useful secondary properties (Flowing Thought, focus effects,
light source, etc.) A mild upgrade?!? I'm in a guild that doesn't touch Ssra
because we're "past" it, and I'd love to have a cloak like that! And for
reference, here's what I look like:

    The Circled Toe Bones should actually be a Shadel Bandit Ring, since I'm
STA-capped with Brute, but since I'm in a competition with a fellow shaman
for "most HPs, caster" I put the CTB on my profile (one or two more HPs,
woo-hoo!) I'm going to finally move it off Delores soon so I can get more of
them when they drop in CoD - it's a really common drop, and they sell well.
