I doubt it. There are a number of things in EQ that defy real life
events and phsyics.

No, but I do want a flying car. The Avro Car came close, but no
cookie. And the personal jet pack, only 30 seconds.., almost close,
but no cookie.

It is a game, its not real life. I didn't like Donkey Kong. Played
it only once.

If another game can setup the hotkeys so a weapon swap can occur
with one click, so can this game.

Yes, I just want the ability to easily swap weapons. Other games can
do it, so it should be possible in EQ as well.

From the comments, its not possible. So a simple answer, 'its not
possible' was all that was needed. Of course, I've been on usenet
enough years to know that if umbrage can be taken it will be. Or
silly tangents will sprout wings.

I didn't specify an amount of time for the weapon change. Where you
decided I meant one second, is beyond me.

In NWN, the monsters get an attack of oppurtunity for weapon
changes.
