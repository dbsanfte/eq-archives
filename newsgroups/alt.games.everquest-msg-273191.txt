I read in one of the bazillion forums I scan (and now I can't find it) that 
there is a slash command that lets you open your bank from anywhere - you 
can't interact with it, but you can at least see what's in there.  There was 
also one for merchants, so you could see if the booty you just picked up had 
any value.

Anyone else heard about this or know what the commands are?
