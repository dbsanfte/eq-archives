My understanding is that he was already that at creation. :-P

My first "main" was Half-Elf Druid. Screwed up my starting stats and
had a base Wis of 85. Levelled that bad boy up Pre-Kunark. Having a
"kiddie-pool" for mana was challenging back then.

Damn, now I am starting to re-think my choice. Perhaps I should do the
Half-Elf thing again...He would have plenty of reason to get drunk.
:-P
