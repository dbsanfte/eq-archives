    I once had to lead a fellow guildmate (Dwarf paladin) from Kaladim to
Kelethin on auto-follow because he was so hammered in real life. Before that
we'd called him "Dark Knight of Kaladim" because of his full
Bloodforge/Blackened Iron armour; after that, "Drunk Knight of Kaladim". He
also managed to max out Alcohol Tolerance first of all of us....
