It's fairly common for guilds (at least those of 40+) to have access
to an account with a high-level cleric/wizard/druid and a low-level
Brell rogue and Rallos Zek troll warrior when the owner(s) aren't online.
(The rogue is used for corpse retrieval in the Hole.  The warrior is
used for dragging corpses in Kael.   A cleric means always having
one available for a rez.   And the wizard and druid provide ports.)
Add in an account used for mules and the guild bank, too.

If I shared my account so the guild could use it (I don't, and I
wouldn't), I'd sure expect the guild to PL me up on a new account
if VI banned the one I shared.   Sang here says he has access to
more than 10 accounts in his guild, for instance.  I'd wager he'd do
his best to PL and equip a new one up if the owner got banned.

At any rate, I wouldn't see that as anything but *expected* behavior,
providing the account was being shared for guild purposes.
