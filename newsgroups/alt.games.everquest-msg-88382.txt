Snipped good advice

Thanks (and thanks to all the expressed their opions). Like I said all
seemed well after I did this and I explained to the person that sent
me the tell I plain and simple didn't know. He even offered to advise
me on other aspects of the game when it became known that I'm a new
comer, nice of him.

Yeah, I've been trying to get a good rep, I throw buffs out alot, when
I deal in pelts I make sure they get top price (at least top price
that I'm willing to pay) even if they don't ask for that much, use
snare alot for those fighting mobs fleet of foot, hang out in newbie
areas buffing and watching over them (to a degree, sometimes hard
knocks is the only way to learn things well), etc.

Some times I'm just having a bad day emotionaly in real life and it
kinda blends in with my game play. I'll get over it. My only other
experience with camping to any degree was Orc Hill in Greater Faydark
and this is why this didn't seem right to me. Of course alot more
spawns to go around in Faydark. I'll quit making exscuses now ;-)

Now I should say that what happened did surprise me some and this is
why. When I snared out of a camp before only the orc I snared came out
of the camp, dispatched and repeated until camp was cleaned. When I
did it at the camped orc area, every orc in the camp came running at
me. There were different type orcs in the group with one conning light
blue to me and he was the one I snared, was this the difference? In
other words why did I get different results using the same method.
