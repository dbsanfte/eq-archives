That doesn't really matter in this case.  If you were to create a
temporary character with the same name as you and it succeeds then you
can just leave it there and it'll have an X appended to its name and
the character you want would be fine.  (assuming that you don't play
the temporary character more than you've ever played the character you
want to keep)
