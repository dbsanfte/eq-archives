had a friend who hunted in the plane of growth; bad move for a tunare
worshipping ranger! Apparently he needs servant of tunare faction restored.
He thinks he heard of a quest for this. I suspect he's thinking of the
muffins for pandos quest, which won't help in this situation. Anyone heard
of anything?

He thinks the quest is in plane of knowledge.
