Good luck (seriously). I just finished cancelling my 3 SWG accounts and
returned to EQ after 7 months as a Master Weaponsmith. I led a pretty
privileged life with far more money than I would ever have been able to
spend in my character's lifetime, producing the best pistols ever seen on my
Galaxy (my FWG5 was 77-457 1.4). Although I still think it's the best
crafting system I've ever seen implemented, there just wasn't enough else to
do to keep me interested and eventually the game just ran out of gas. This
might change after a year or two with some attention paid to content and
fixing some of the egregious defects that still remain. By then, however,
I'm expecting to be making my way through EQ2. Choices, choices!

Good luck!
