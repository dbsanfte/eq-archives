I, for one, really like the idea. It's the first time I can recall ever 
seeing even the slightest emphasis placed on extra effort during the actual 
crafting process paying off in a crafting system.

I wonder how much affect this will actually have on the number of people 
willing to put in the time necessary to achieve the higher levels. EQ's 
crafting system was extremely tedius, though also extremely simple, and 
there has been no shortage of those willing to stick it out there.
