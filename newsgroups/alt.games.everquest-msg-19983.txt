You will not evade me, Marc Fuller <katoran@mindspring.com>:

Just wondering - are you talking about Katha Firespinner? My DE can
shop with her just fine... she cons indifferent and I never had to
kill orcs for her.

You'd think paladins would have better manners, wouldn't you? I
recently had fun goading an Erollisi worshipping paladin friend about
how he should give in to hate (was playing my SK). He told me Erollisi
cared about even scum like me, so I went on about how him calling me
dark elf scum showed his inner devotion to hate and that he was too
weak to freely follow the hatred within him :)

> And then he offered to duel me.

You gotta wonder what possesses people to issue stupid /duels, whether
it be to someone way above or way below them.
