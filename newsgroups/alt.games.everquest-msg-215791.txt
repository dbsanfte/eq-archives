Sadly, this doesn't work as well as it should.  You see, you get one or two
item summons per spell level, even though a complete set is 6 items deep.
Working up to 20, you spend a good deal of time not yet able to summon the
equivalents of level I focus items.  There are a couple anomolous ones that
work on spells 24 or under, but at 29, your next spell level, you suddenly have
exactly one item that applies to your current spells.  At 34 you get another...
but this still leaves you several items short of a full set, which you'll have
the spells for by just about the time where you need the level III focus items.

Were it I, I'd give you the first set of summons at level one, the second set
at 24, the third set at 44, and the last at 61; the levels at which the
previous sets become obsolete.  Doesn't work that way, though, if you rely on
summons instead of buying "real" focus items, you end up not having an average
of half the focus items you hypothetically can summon.

To add injury to insult, in some cases the summoned items appear to be less
effective than "real" focus items.

And then to really twist the knife in your gut, there's no Improved Heal focus
summon at all; we get Burning Affliction, when we have no DOTs, and DOTs are
largely irrelevant in groups anyway; but no IH when we actually use heals on
our pets, and in groups there's almost always a healer, but often there's no IH
item as they tend to be prohibatively expensive.

Fun, eh?
