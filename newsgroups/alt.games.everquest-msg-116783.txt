I usually sow people that ask for it, though nowadays I prefer if they
are high enough level to cast SoE on so I don't have to go digging in
my spellbook. 
Those who sow plz'ed me last night while I was smithing were an
exception: I was having a bad time with the random number generator
while I was making banded (Jazz, if you read this, your skewer rant
came to mind), and did not feel like closing down what I was doing to
sit down, mem sow and look for random_person_07, or having someone
thinking 1 pp would be the same as covering the component costs for
the banded shoulders he wanted and didn't get.
I ended up going anon and then running off to bind a dark elf outside
the gate, and making someone (who *did* run off and get the
components) a filleting knife.
I am thinking about strip mining my alts for spiderling silks and
pelts and doing a little fine plate tonight, if I get the time >:)

(I non sequitur my rants a lot, don't I?)
