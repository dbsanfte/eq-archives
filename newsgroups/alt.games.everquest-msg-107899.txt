Odd, I always hear how fast necros are at levelling because they can often
take on yellow mobs.

I have friend who levelled his bard really fast using AoE kiting and swarm kiting
... taking down  groups of mobs (AoE)  or mob after mob (swarm),  though it does
take a while, and takes quite a lot of practice.  And he did this all with an untwinked
bard, on a PvP server no less.
