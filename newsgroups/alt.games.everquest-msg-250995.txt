Its quite likely.  BUT, like Betamax was arguably the finest videotape 
format, I'm happy enough, because far more people made the same bad 
choice with me, and IBM/DOS/Windows is by far the most popular, and well 
supported machine of all time.

Fat lot of good it would do me to sit around with my vintage '82 betamax 
machine and my collection of tapes produced in the early 80s, gloating 
that the vast majority of movie watchers are idiots.

I have no direct experience with the amiga, but I'd say C64 was better 
than MacIntosh, and MacIntosh was (and probably still is) better than 
DOS/Windows... but despite being at best third choice, DOS/Windows has 
turned out to be the best choice.

Sadly, applying the same logic today would suggest that I should run out 
and get a Playstation or something, rather than continue to use a 
computer of any sort for gaming.  Electronics Boutique in the local mall 
has now shrunk its PC games section down to a single floor to ceiling 
wall section roughly 4 feet wide, a sad reduction when PC games once 
occupied 3/4ths the store (and even Mac had twice the square footage 
that the entire computer games section now occupies)
