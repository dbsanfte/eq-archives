    Why is that? The system doesn't depend on people being there or not. If
you're not there, you don't get a share of the points. Same as now, really -
people who aren't at a raid don't get points for it. This just changes how
the points are handed out to the people who do go.

    They do have other features that might not work without strict
attendance requirements. For example, if that guild attempts a mob they've
never killed and fails, then the people present get a "we tried" bonus equal
to half the lowest number of points that mob could give out (they
pre-determine drop values). The total number of "we tried" points handed out
are added up, and at the end of the week every guild member loses points
equal to the "we tried" divided by the total number of guild members. So
it's a small bonus for the people who went, and a small points loss for
those who didn't attend. That might not go over well in many guilds.
