Well, yes. However, in my experience most of the backpacks I've sold
have been used for the purpose of additional bank storage. Now there
are cheap ten slot solutions with no danger of accidental combining,
the market for bank-use backpacks is essentially dead. It was a big
market.

The 10% weight reduction alleviates this slightly, but there are a
number of looted options that have better reduction, and can be had as
cheaply.

I really don't see that your average character will want more than two
tailored backpacks, where before they would want potentially ten.


Of course, on the flip side of the coin, it was already starting to
seem to me that the market on existing servers was getting saturated,
so sales were already slowing.
