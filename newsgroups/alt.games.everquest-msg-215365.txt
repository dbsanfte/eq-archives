Ive fought for quite a while as a ranger using Call of Sky on a Venomous
Axe of the Velium Brood....Ive not yet seent he two procs go off on a
single hit....its a bit difficult to say precisely because Ive seen dual
wield and double attack go off together and seen both the axe proc and the
spell proc go off immediately below and there I cant seperate the two as
two which hit or weapon the Call of Sky went on nd the number of single
hits where the dual wield and the double attack both fail but I still get
a proc is pretty small....
