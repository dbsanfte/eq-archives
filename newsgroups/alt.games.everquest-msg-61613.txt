I thought I had a handle on this, but I'm now a bit confused. At level
47, my rogue seems to quad-hit quite regularly, easy to see because 1
have a piercer in main and a 1hs in secondary. Sometimes, however, I
will see her fire out a flurry of four or five slash hits in a row
with no pierce hits or misses in between and no visible pause. This
usually happens in "full sewing machine" mode-8/17 piercer, 12/24 1hs,
FBSS, and haste from a level 55 enchanter, but I'm still not sure how
it happens.
