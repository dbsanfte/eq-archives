Yeah, I noticed that! ;) Was planning on selling at least 2, and I guess at
least 4, since they're warrior only.

Not outrageously twinked, and *always* grouped before this with ex's necro,
and *not* looking to group in the future.

Well, I hated the warrior when I didn't group, and since ex is off playing
DAoC, I doubt I'll group again (I'm kinda a solitary person to begin with).
I have an enchanter and a druid (she rocks!), never had a ranger or a rogue,
but I already have a shaman (not too thrilled with her either :( ). So necro
or beastlord to solo maybe? Tried a necro *once* for about 20 minutes and
couldn't get out of that damned city of theirs (though I know my way now,
from helping a friend play!). Necros seem to be ok, but I think I would hate
their KOS status. I'd have to do lots of farming just to go to other
zones/cities, it seems. Is it worth it? Are necros that good? I've heard
lots of people say they are, hands down, the best solo class in the game.

thanks for the input!
