You don't really need to buy any new armor and you don't need to buy
every spell every time you get new spells.  I have 42 Druid with a lot
of Patch Work and just started going back to buy spells like endure
magic and that 29 level sow.  Just level up and you will soon get
stuff.  The time it takes to buy stuff you could be using to progress
to a higher level.  When you hit 29 you will be able to make money
porting. 

Go to East Karanas and hunt hounds with your full buffs and Damage
shields, and then do the same in South Karanas.  SK will give you a
chance to get some cheap Paw equipment that I am also wearing.  Once
you are done in SK go to Overthere and get in a group.  Write back
when you are done with Overthere and I will tell you your next step
for exciting low risk casual EQing
