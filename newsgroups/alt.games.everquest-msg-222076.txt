The Iksar and the Vah Shir don't even have class-designed newbie armor 
quests.  :/  The Vah Shir have the Shadeweaver's Thicket quests, though I 
hear the BP is very difficult to get the drops for.  The Iksar have 
curscale, which doesn't even have a graphic, and the necros can't wear it.  
Oh, monks have sparring armor, but each piece requires getting broken slave 
shackles, and of all the time I've spent in the Swamp of No Hope, I've only 
ever seen ONE escaped froglok slave.  And never a "Froglok Escort" (just 
the minor "a froglok escort" ones).

My scaley monk spent her lowest levels in the Qeynos newbie zone and used 
the plat to buy several pieces of Wu's Fighting Armor.  Much better, but 
less satisfying somehow.

Time to start my shackle quest series, I think.
