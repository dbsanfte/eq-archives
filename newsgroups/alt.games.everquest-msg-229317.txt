the following is not my idea im not Anonimous Clerique, 65 cleric.
===========================================================================
How about a real EQ gambling game, done the only way ANYTHING in EQ is done
properly - by players.

Based on a local lottery structure, I'm willing to try to organize and track
lottery wagers (just like state/province lotteries in RL) if people are up
for it. Below is a long description of how it would work. Read what you
can/want, but please post if you'd consider playing

----------------------------------------------------------
The structure looks like this:


"Tickets" would cost 100pp each. I'll put in 10,000pp of my own to generate
some interest.

45% of sales go to the Prize Fund (minimum = 4500)
55% of sales go to the Pool Fund (minimum = 5500)


Each wagerer chooses 4 numbers, from 1-49 inclusive with no repetitions.
Each week there would be a /random in-game (would do [/random 1 49] until 4
different numbers come up). Payout would look like this:

Match 4/4 - 60% of the Pool Fund
Match 3/4 - 25% of the Pool Fund
Match 2/4 - 15% of the Pool Fund
Match 1/4 - All winners evenly split the Prize Fund


*A winning "ticket" will get you the prize from only one of these categories

*If there is more than one winning ticket in a category, the prize any such
category will be shared

*All sales collected and not given out carry over to the following week

----------------------------------------------------------

The hard part with this is taking wagers ("selling tickets" and recording
the numbers people pick). The best way I can think of doing this involves
three simple things:

1. Have a merchant set-up in The Bazaar selling "tickets" (any item one can
carry in quantity, like a water flask) for a certain amount. The person
running the lottery logs chat and trader sales (automatic).

2. People buy a "ticket", then send a tell to the merchant with their four
numbers (no repetitions).

3. Each day the person running the lottery would bring the merchant down, go
through the chat and vendor logs and list the people who purchased "tickets"
and their chosen numbers. After this the merchant can go back up with a full
stack of new tickets. At the end of the week the lottery would end and
winners would be posted here. People could then collect their winnings
in-game.

----------------------------------------------------------

Boring safety/security stuff:

1. The item that the merchant character sells as a ticket is meaningless -
this is just the best way to take wagers from people over a long period of
time (leave the merchant up and afk with logs on).

2. There are two reasons for logging both chat and vendor sales in (2)
above: (a) the tells from wagerers record their chosen numbers for their
ticket, and (b) the log of merchant "ticket" sales records who actually paid
for a ticket (so people can't send tells with numbers trying to mize a
"ticket" without paying).

3. The logs will be easy to compare by using the Find command in any basic
program. The person would scroll down the merchant sales log and then do a
search in the chat log once for each "ticket" purchase shown from the
merchant log.

4. The use of logs makes this possible even if The Bazaar crashes - each
transation is saved immediately and there's virtually no risk of ticket
purchase information being lost. The ONLY risk is that someone will buy a
ticket and the server will crash before they send the merchant a tell with
their numbers (like I said, very small chance).

5. An Excel spreadsheet can organize players and their chosen numbers (each
"ticket" for a player would have it's own row, with the columns being
"Player" and "Ticket #s"). This spreadsheet can be thrown on a webpage and
viewed by everybody (only after all wagers for the week are in, of course)
for peace of mind.

5. The problem. Everybody who participates has to trust the person running
the lottery. This will only work if you believe that the person running the
lottery will not embezzle or otherwise fuck shit up on purpose.

6. Why? I can do this, it doesn't seem that hard. At the very least I'd like
to give it one shot and then if it's hard screw future lotteries  Another
why - why play? Because it will (hopefully) be a lot of money - and there
will be multiple winners virtually guaranteed (unlike the Casino). Why 100pp
a ticket? Because if it's too small a cost, people will have to buy huge
amounts of tickets, which makes organizing the logs very tedious.

7. THE REAL WHY. Why should you trust me? I've been playing here a long time
and I'm damn honest when it comes to this sort of thing; both in-game for
the past 3 years and in real life. I welcome anybody who thinks I've done
anything dishonest to post here. Ask around if you want.
