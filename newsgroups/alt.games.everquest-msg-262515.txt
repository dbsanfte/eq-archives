Of course, if Satan wanted to infiltrate and seduce the world, he'd not 
be constrained to the letters a,a,n,s, & t. He'd be free to pick a name 
like Ernie, Bert, or Elmo.

Perhaps more importantly, with the number of names and languages out 
there, the fact that of the satan-santa anagram is about us unremarkable 
as the fact that 9/11 was a Tuesday, named for the Norse God of War.

Of course the people that actually perpetrated the attack don't call it 
Tuesday... and the people that the attack was perpetrated on by and 
large don't actually know that...

Still... its ominous right... ooOOOoooOOOOo.... 

Nah... the real significance of 9/11 was really to send a message to a 
certain Porsche owner... He knows who he is.
