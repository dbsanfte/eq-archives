I think she meant "broke" as in no money, not messed up/useless.
Anyway, as far as wizards go, try telling a 50+ wiz quad kiting in CS that
his class is broken. Im sure he'd find it quite amusing.
here are some canditates Id have for broken classes:
Druid (post 50)
Bard (Post 50)
Ranger (post 50)

Why? well just try playing one and getting in a group. Bard is cool you say?
Compare a bard usefullness with a chanter and they suddenly arnt that cool
at all. Just consider the % of time a bard has to devote to keeping tanks
hasted/casters cleritied, compared to an enchanter. For clarity its 100% for
the bard and maybe 10% for the enchanter. For speed its 33% for the bard,
and maybe 5% (less) for the enchanter. Add in that bard mez sucks, and
almost every group will take a chanter over a bard.
Druid only gets in a group for snares or evacs, and rangers for snare and
meleeing, cos they arnt ideal tanks.
