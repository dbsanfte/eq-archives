I notice that Fire Beetle eyes tend to overwrite just about every other
light that I've had, a Large Lantern, Coldlight stone (level 1 necro
summon), the paineel newbie key, a regular LS, a GLS, a small lantern, but
not a split paw mask, unless the mask bugs and stops being a light. (note:
SP mask seems to be more powerful than a GLS in my experience)
