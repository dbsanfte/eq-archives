Ahh the tinfoil hat brigade has arrived.

I have only had one virus in over 15 years of computing from nothing more
than having common sense. No neurotic security measures, no faraday cages
around the PC, no firewalls on firewalls, just good old fashioned common
sense. The one virus I got was MSblaster as it managed to get me on a fresh
W2K install before I finished the patching process.

As per usual, I am running IE, security set to default "medium". I use
Outlook Express for email and newsgroups, the only security consideration is
turning off the preview pane as getting emailed virii is a daily occurence
for me (I get just under 100 spams a day since my email address is over 5
years old). I am running no software firewall or AV program. Adaware is the
only security application I keep installed. This machine is on 24/7 on
1500/256 adsl connection so is a nice fat target as well, but the router's
built in firewall takes care of that.

Occasionally I download a AV program, update and run it just to be sure it's
still clean. Just pure common sense and a bit of computer literacy is all it
takes.

If you think merely running IE is a security risk for you, then maybe your
right. Running any web browser or email program without enough computer
literacy and common sense to simply not do dumb shit is a security risk.
Maybe you AREN'T clued up enough to do it, perhaps you need your Firefox,
your firewall, AV program and even your tinfoil hat. But if you are still
going to do dumb shit and cannot recognise and acceptable risk from an
unacceptable one then none of your precautions will matter in the end. You
PC will still end up some script kiddies bitch...

Cheers
