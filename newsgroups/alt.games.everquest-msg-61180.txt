I am a 16th level Troll Shadow Knight. I have mostly banded armor,
with a couple of magic armor items thrown in. I recently was able to
make a deal that ended up netting me 500pp. I am now wondering what to
spend it on. I was thinking of getting new armor, but I'm not sure
what to get. I tried bronze at one point, but apparently a Troll can't
wear Bronze. At lease not Large Bronze (what other size is there that
I might be able to wear?). Maybe a piece or two of plate armor? Or
should I look for individual magic armor pieces?

Or should I dispense with all that and spend all my money on building
a trade skill? I think my smithing is up far enough that I don't want
to spend any more money on it at the moment (I can make banded...hence
my full suit of banded armor). Maybe tailoring?

Or finally, should I try to get better weapons? I've got an Axe of the
Iron Back, Velium Scimitar, Drakkel Forged Warhammer, a Screaming
mace, and a Bloodstained Fang (one weapon for each weapon type). I
like to keep all my weapon skills even so that I can use anything
that's thrown my way. All my skills are about 3 levels behind max (I'm
at about 70 skill with each), but I figure they'll catch up soon
enough.

Anyway, what should I spend my plat on?
