I did that at 25, solo.  Naked, in fact, cause I figured I'd die and didn't
want to have to bother doing CR.  Didn't die at all, as it turns out:)

One of the mobs is in Plane of Fear, so you aren't going to be
able to do this under 45 unless you are willing to take an MQ for
it.  Looking over the quest, I don't see any reason that you
couldn't complete it at level one if willing to take MQs.

At any rate, it doesn't make a good counterexample to my
saying that the cleric epic could be started at 29 and still not
completed at 60, on a Ragefire List server anyway.
