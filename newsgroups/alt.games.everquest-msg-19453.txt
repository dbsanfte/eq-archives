The one that all pet classes can use is Summon Companion.  For Magicians,
it's a level 39 spell.  It is sold in the tunnel in East Commons, by the
vendor near the Shady Swashbuckler.  The vendor you want is the one that
looks like an Erudite, usually in chain or platemail.  (I'm not sure if
that is his natural appearance or if he looks like that because people hand
him things.  I know the Priests of Discord are out of uniform a lot on
Bristlebain.)
