Yes, there is a bonus for mobs being closer in
level to you (or higher), but my memory of the
patch message was that it applied to 50's and 
up.

IE  a 60 and a 65 fighting a 60 mob, the 60 will
get a bigger bonus.

This was added because the "Classic" xp group used
to kill non-stop streams of mobs that were as low
as possible while still being dark blue, and they
wanted high levels to take on tougher stuff.

Look at:

For my example above, a 60 soloing a level 60
mob (say a consort) in PoN gets

2.6 bonus multiplier and
1,357,200 xp from it.

The 65 soloing the same mob gets

1.95 bonus multiplier and
1,017,900 xp from it.
