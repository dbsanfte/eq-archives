Hmm i had never heard of winex till now, i knew about wine, which didnt
really run anything usefull that wasnt already ported to linux. That would
be an easier strategy, and if anyone wanted to make there own game they
could just use the emulator and hack the graphics in the client. Only
problem is no one could add engine improvements :( Oh well maybe after Eq2
comes out and about a decade passes they may release the source :P Hmm by
than tho worldforge might actually have a working 3d game :)
Yet if verant add a windows OS detect that would just strengenth the
monopoly that microsoft has built. Software devolopers shouldnt be able to
dictate which os we use. Were paying money for there game and to play it we
should get to choose what we play it on.
