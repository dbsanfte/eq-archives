A very small part of it I guess.

It really only concerns itself with software that is viral in nature.

For a trojan, dialer, etc to get into its detection list it would have 
to be a pretty widespread problem, and in my experience most the dialers 
and trojans it deals with have a viral payload as well or are affiliated 
with virii... but then that's because most of the trojans and dialers 
I've ever seen in a live system got there as part of a viral payload.

Not merely does it -not necessarily trap all- but there is no reason to 
even think it should. Non-viral malware is highly unlikely to be 
addressed by an antivirus tool.
