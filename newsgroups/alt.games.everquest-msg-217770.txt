2 people in guild last night reported that they have 3 wins in every dungeon
and 10 in Tak and it still is not working for them.  No stats are showing on
stone when in the ldon zone.  The theory of 3 in all and 10 in one was told
to us from a guide on the first petition.  We havent heard back yet on the
second (since we found out the first was a crock).
