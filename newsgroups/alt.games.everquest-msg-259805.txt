Exactly. It is, beta, after all. Still, it would be a fairly significant 
change and Blizzard hasn't impressed me with their initiative at remedying 
these kinds of problems. The fact that they announced a contest rewarding 
the *highest* levels at the end of the beta tell me that they view the whole 
game as a race. I'm betting this doesn't change.
