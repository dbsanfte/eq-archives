>(1) Expand the zone size

I would say REMOVE the arena from the zone (or convert it to Player
Vendor space). Retexture it with the smallest and least memory
intensive textures as possible. the zone doesn't have to look good. It
just has to serve the intended purpose.

>(2) More entry points

People will take the shortest route regardless of how many zone in
points there are. If there were 10 zone-in points right now, only 2-3
would be used by the majority of players.

Your client PC would still have to draw all of the characters in the
zone whether or not the player was online at the time. Offline selling
would not reduce lag or the number of people in the zone.
