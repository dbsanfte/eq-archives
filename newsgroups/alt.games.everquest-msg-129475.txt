I took out 128 out of my system to bring up my bro from 256 to 384 and make
his EQ more smooth.  We had success in that.  But I noticed that dropping
from 768 to 640 affected my performance.  The bazaar and areas with a lot of
people are a whole lot slower.  I would have expected a slight reduction but
I took a major hit just losing that 128.  Note that it hasn't affected my
normal play in any way whatsoever, just when 10+ people are in the area and
they happen to be in my area of view.

So every little bit helps, even if you have more than 512mb.
