>>> Hmm, guides were supposed to be authorized to summon players whose
travel was impared by the broken shuttles/boats. <<<

They are authorized. I had this problem Wed (I think), sitting in Erudin
waiting for the boat. I was sitting on the shuttle watching the boat come
and go. After the second time the boat came and went, I petitioned. After
the third time, I hit /who GM all. Two guides and an Admin GM popped up, so
I sent a tell to one of the guides.

After a minute, she sent me a tell stating the GMs are aware of the
situation, it will be fixed by tomorrows patch. She then came to Erudin and
ported me to Qeynos.

Apparently by the responses here, the patch didn't fix the boats.

BTW, about five minutes after the guide ported me ("you have been summoned
by the gods!") the GM sent me a tell asking if I still needed a port. Guess
there wasn't very many petitions that night.
