Party DOwn? Not in the US, come to Europe and party untill YOU can't any
more, don't let the politicians and the police stop your partying.

Europe: drink when you want to (no need for ID)
Bars are open untill people can't party anymore (between 5-12(AM for you US
people)

No girls saying "no sex untill marriage" (at least not in northern Europe)
