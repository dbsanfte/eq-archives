That would be a plurality, not a majority.  And we most certainly do
not all subscribe to either the belief that "hell" exists or that
those who do not profess our particular doctrine are going there
after death (note that those who subscribe to the "damned to hell"
belief come from a variety of sects, and many of these sects believe
that everybody not in their particular sect is doomed.)

As far as I can tell, a majority of the world's self-identified
Christians, past and present, completely ignore Jesus most fundamental
lesson, taught rather graphicly by the manner of the death he chose,
that humility and self-sacrifice are the ultimate virtues.  They also
make a habit of ignoring many of the least convenient of his other
lessons (sell all you have and give to the poor, if your enemy strikes
you turn the other cheek, love your enemy, etc.) and focus instead on
the grubby and occassionally self-serving rhetoric from the political
struggles of his early followers.  It's a shame that the world has
come to associate this behavior with the word Christian, as these folks
are not only far from the ideal Jesus taught, they spend far too much
of their time moving in the other direction.

Personally, I hope that we do continue to try to "take the moral high
ground" in international affairs.  Not because I want us to try to ram
whatever popular moral standard is being championed by the government
du jour down the world's throat, but rather because I want to see us
holding up a standard that we are attempting to meet and inviting the
world to judge both our chosen standard of behavior and our compliance
with it.

One of the things that distinguishes the USA most sharply from the
overwhelming majority of national governments past and present is our
habit of debating the "rightness" of our actions in an often
embarrasingly public fashion.  Our history books do acknowledge and
comment on many of the evils our leaders have perpetrated upon others,
and we do have public debate over whether we give fair treatment to
the disadvantaged, both foreign and domestic, in our policies and our
popular media and our educational materials.  If there is one thing
that gives me hope that our culture will survive our present decadence
it is this remarkable openness, which is a natural byproduct of our
love of liberty and the freedom of speech and association that we rely
upon to protect that liberty.

ROFL  Though in my view a slight shift in emphasis improves it a tad:
What do _you_ think subjective means?  :)
