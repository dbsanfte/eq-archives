When I started EQ2, I deliberately did not create an enchanter,
because I wanted to try something different.  But after a couple of
weeks I was really missing my ability to mez.  There's something about
mezzing and then seeing the mob just stand there, gazing into space.
Maybe it's so satisfying because in RL you can't force annoying people
to shut up, but in EQ one wave of your wand and the deed is done.

I'll have to check that out, and also take a look at the options as
the other poster mentioned.  Seems like there has to be a way to
distinguish.
