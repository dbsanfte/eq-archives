Mildly interesting introspective on this.  Last night I was in PoK, getting
ready to camp (up past bedtime again, whutta surprise) and someone was
/oocing to the zone that he needed help finding his corpse.  Poor guy seemed
frantic.  I did a /who - level 10 human cleric, on his first death since
level.  I asked him where he died, and he wasn't sure - it never mattered
before.  At least he could tell me which zone.

Did you know pre-10 characters *object* to getting a rez?  It only saves
them the walk back to their corpse, and it costs them all this health and
mana...
