Well, I should have be more specific in my previous post :) LOIO is
indeed now on the verge of becoming an unbearable zone just like (or
worse than) Oasis. This is actually the first zone where I shut /ooc
and /shout as soon as I'm in a group. It used not to be that way when
I hunted there with my primary, and I went from 19 to 29 in a breeze,
really. 
But now that I'm back here with my secondary (I know, that's pityful
to go hunt in the same zone with both char !), I agree with you : the
zone is a juvenile playground in the way of Oasis, just worse.
As for exp, I've found only Sarnaks are good exp once you're around
22-23. Hunting by the fort (and, later, in the fort) is a great
experience maker. The ledges inside the fort are awesome exp spot,
really. You get a constant flow of Sarnaks, occasionnals Adherants or
worse, but mainly nice Conscripts, Recruits and Lego, lining up for
the show (an enchanter is nice to have around, though, are they often
don't want to stay in a line !). So I might be wrong, but I have found
the exp in the gobies caves to be slow and useless if you can get
instead into a group hunting at the fort's ledge or (later) throne
room.
Truely, LOIO is awesome exp if you stick to fort groups.

Jo.
