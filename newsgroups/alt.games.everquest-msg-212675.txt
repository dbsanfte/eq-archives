Many Halas factions can be raised via several quests inside Halas; there's no
way to raise it from KOS, unlike some factions, because there's nothing you
can kill to get faction hits.  However, you can very likely use sneak or charm
or illusion barbarian to manage to get non KOS to quest givers, then hand in
tons of collected quest materials so as to get non KOS in Halas.

Most of Kelethin is on simple factions that can be raised by killing in
Crushbone, among other methods, there -are- NPCs in Kelethin that you can't
make up with in this way, but I've run my cleric around in POG killing for a
couple days (and it only takes 4 mobs to bottom out factions there) and then
spent a couple hours slaughtering every orc that moves in Crushbone and was at
Warmly to most NPCs in Kelethin... whether I'd never lost the faction at all
or whether the Crushbone killing fixed it I don't know, didn't check
beforehand (I was in Crushbone for the catharsis of it and collecting those CB
belts for an alt)
