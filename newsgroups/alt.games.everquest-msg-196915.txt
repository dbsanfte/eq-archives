I had a guy like that annoying me in Rathe mountains. I shrugged and moved
on. Couple of days later I was hunting giants in FM, and he (not remebering
me I assume) kept bugging me for a SoW. I must admit, I was slightly
flustered and confused at the time (ahem) and accidentally cast SCALE of the
Wolf on him (oops ...). For some reason he didn't manage to outrun the next
giant he attacked and got flattened like a pancake.

I generally leave things to Karma, but every now and then it's nice to give
it a push in the right direction ;)
