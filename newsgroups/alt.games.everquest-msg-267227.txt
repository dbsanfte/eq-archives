I agree that it does feel like a more casual gaming environment. For
some reason I don't feel the urge to stay up all night power-levelling
my guy in EQ2, so I may stick with it just for that reason.

As for the graphics, I just built a new comp last month and in
fullscreen mode with the options turned way up (but not maxed) the
game looks VERY nice. The only thing I turn off the the foliage, since
it obscures shorter animals. My system specs are:

Athlon64 3200 (socket 939)
EGA 6800GT
MSI "K8T NEO2-FIR" motherboard
1GB of Crucial Ballistix DDR PC-3200
70GB SATA WD Raptor (after the vidcard, this is my favorite new
component... practically halves load times from my old EIDE system)

EQ2 is one of the best looking games out right now, IMO. I wouldn't
say it's "cartoonish" at all. Sometimes at night the colors do look a
little washed out though.
