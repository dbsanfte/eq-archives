1. It doesn't sound like the LDoN dungeons will be a place to PL, so you
will probably be able to find a fourth who wants to play at the same pace
you do.

2. You can make a private channel to chat with your friends, so having a
stranger in groupchat doesn't have to dampen things.

3. Find another group of 3 that is annoyed that LDoN is for groups of 4+,
form a group of 6, and take one of the bigger dungeons, then the two parties
can take separate routes through the dungeon, or leapfrog each other, or in
some similar way effectively play as two groups of three, perhaps uniting
whenever something is encountered that needs more than one of the parties
can handle.
