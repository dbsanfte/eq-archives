Your playing a Vah Shir yet you talk like an Orge, by the time you get 
get high enough level to compleate the quests you should have a equal or 
better wepon. If your planning on killing sonic wolfs for a living then 
that's alot better but even then there is better wepons out there. With 
the bazaar now adays you can get good wepons for a little bit of 
nothing. By the time you get the four other classes to make there parts 
you could have had a better wepon by far! (assumeing you farm or just 
level up)
