He still has to actually get aggro.  Only way this would work with someone
afk is if it was a KOS mob and you let it attack the afk person before
sending in the pet.

As someone who has 2-boxed a magician and cleric, as long as the cleric just
heals the pet (zero aggro) he can stand in melee range of the mob, but as
soon as he heals the magician and actually has aggro on the mob, gotta move.
