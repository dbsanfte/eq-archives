As time goes on, new weapons are added that are really nice, and aren't on
your current skill.  After bouncing between 1hs and 2hs for my entire
career, I now find myself with a Tae Ew War Maul.  Nice 1hb... oops, I
haven't used a 1hb since I wielded the Shining Star of Light (which is now
on my cleric).  So, do I upgrade to a weapon I can't use, or do I stick with
a lesser 2hs?  That's a bad position to be in, na no da.
