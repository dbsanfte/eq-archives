That argument doesn't fly, sorry.  It's been beaten over & over again and
still won't fly.  Besides, you don't own time so you can't sell it. :)

I wouldn't say "illegal" because that means it's a crime.  It's certainly
against your contract with Verant though.

No, don't know where to sell, sorry.  Been toying with the idea of selling
my 55 enchanter, just wondering how much it'd be worth, but I probably
wouldn't ever do it...it's a part of me, in a weird sort of way.
