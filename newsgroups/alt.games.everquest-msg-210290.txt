One rule, really, as far as I can see: Just because you can doesn't mean
you should.

You should be aware of what aggro various activities cause. This means
if you are a mage, don't nuke every time the button comes open. If you
are a cleric, watch which heals you use and when. If you are a melee,
watch your delays and skills. Basically, be aware of what you do that
generates hate, and how much, and make sure that number stays under what
the MA can do.
