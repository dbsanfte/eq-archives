Probably, although, at level 11, it's no more boring than leveling much of
any other character.  I know I have pretty well stopped soloing my shaman
because of the long downtime between kills for medding.  With KEI going, I
can keep that downtime pretty minimal, but it still takes a long time for a
mob to die to my pet and DoTs.
