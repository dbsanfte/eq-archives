Let me explain it again: These people have been carefully spoon-fed
propoganda for their entire lives. Propoganda that colors America as
monsters, a direct threat to their way of life, their lives, and even
their souls. Propoganda that leads them to beleive Americans are less
than human, that Americans are, in fact, hellspawned demons.

In short, they've been brainwashed.

Be angry. But don't hate. Pity.

Be angry. But don't become them.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
