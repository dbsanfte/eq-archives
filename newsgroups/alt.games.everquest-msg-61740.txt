Your druids aren't used to bard occasionally wanting sow, are they? In
my cases, it's usually the sow-wanting bard who does the 'mock shock'
thing for me :) 175% with a nice drum, eh? Cheetah only does 110%...
(Still, it'd be fun if I could talk someone into a drumless race)

BTW, was nice to see a sensible way to let a bard handle travel (ie
bard NOT be the leader). I've avoided letting bards do travel
arrangements for me due to a couple mishaps which dealt with only
selo's...
