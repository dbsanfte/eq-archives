How about this- I am an Abuse Administrator at an ISP. When I receive DMCA 
violations, I must not only take action, but then I must *report* my 
actions back to the DMCA.

In other words, the law empowers the MPAA / RIAA / Whoever to act as a cop. 
And you know what? I do it. Because it is the law.

There's *one* instance where your privacy has been invaded, and you did not 
even know about it. There are many many more, and I am sure MPAA/RIAA 
lawyers have already cudgeled many people with threats of jail, insane 
fines, or lengthy lawsuits and criminal proceedings.
