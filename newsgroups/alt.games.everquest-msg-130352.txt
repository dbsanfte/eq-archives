Like I've said before, I think that, given the disadvantages of the
spell over the skill, it should never give the "fallen to the ground"
failure. The skill is instant and manaless. It can't fizzle or be
interrupted by a melee attack. The skill is also physical training to
force your body to simulate death, while the spell is a magic
enchantment to make your body act dead. If the spell is successfully
cast, it should always result in a successful "skill check".
