There've been lots of reports of continuing problems with low-end
skillups, in melee skills and also tradeskills.  I wish SOE would
acknowledge that there's still a bug here and that they're working
on it.  I've had to give up any hope of advancing my mid-level
tradeskills for now.  (Last night I tried 100 pottery skillups at
174 using a triv 188, and got zero skillups.  My last several
tradeskill sessions have been, well, obviously not as bad as that,
but pretty darned bad.)

My baby SK is also seeing very few skillups in Meditation, not to
mention he's done a full level using mostly Piercing, and gotten
only a handful of skillups (currently up to 24, and I think 10 of
those were using training points).
