Heh.   On my first day back after reactivating my account (9 month break), I
ended up main tanking for a group in Guk.  Warrior, two paladins, shaman,
mage and druid.   One of the paladins even ended up commenting "Holy shit, a
warrior that can hold aggro."

Kind of makes me wonder, after all the posts I've seen here about how
warriors are such horrible tanks now, exactly how much of that was
exaduration or the effects of poor warriors.

(No, not implying anything about you, just commenting on an issue you made
me think of.)
