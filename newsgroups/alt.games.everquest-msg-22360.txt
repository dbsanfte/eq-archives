To get places fast, you'll want a teleporter:  Druid or Wizard
To run fast you'll want SoW:  Druid, shaman, or potions (or tboots if they
have that kind of cash, or jboots if they have that kind of patience)

If you have a pure caster (getting spells at level 1) you'll want a way to
get mana back faster: enchanter, bard, necro

Druid ports are more convenient than wizard, though the wizard translocate
spells are very sweet.  My vote is for druid.

It's my considered opinion (because I've considered it a long time) that a
druid + anything is a great combo.  My personal preference is
druid/enchanter.  Both can nuke, both have the ability to save the other's
life, both have spells that facilitate a hasty departure.

I've heard "oh, yeah man, nuthin' beats a cleric and warrior duo!"  Yeah,
ok, I guess.  Druids make fine healers in a duo situation...and hell, shaman
provide even more than druids (except the ability to get places fast).  The
only thing a cleric provides that the others can't is an experience rez
starting at 39.
