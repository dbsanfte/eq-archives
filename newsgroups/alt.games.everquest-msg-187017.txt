lol... I bet he isn't even aware of what he sounds like.  It may even seem
entirely logical to him: TA won't go out of its way to get him his epic -
perfectly understandable, it's not their business to get him his epic.  But
he wants to progress in the game by joining a more-capable guild.  And being
an epic bard will make him a more valuable addition to that guild.  So he's
just letting you know - he knows he couldn't expect TA to get him his epic,
so he'll get his epic first, then join TA.  He'll have progressed, you'll
have an epic bard, everyone should be happy.

The fact that he's screwing over his old guild hasn't even entered his mind.
That fact that he's so nakedly and openly using people to further his own
goals isn't something he's even aware of.  Poor guy.  =)

I think it's one of the most important lessons someone needs to learn in
order to be a mature individual: that their words and actions will affect
others as well, and that they need to take other people's needs into
consideration before they act.  Alas that many folks never learn this
lesson.

Truly evil people are people who are consciously aware that they are using
people to further their own goals at the expense of these other people.
Lots of those kind of folks in EQ, alas.
