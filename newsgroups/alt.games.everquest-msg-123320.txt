/as
definately completely reliably every time works
Never seen it fail to work

Was about 50 levels into the game before I made
a hotkey for it... and I have to say its a lot handier
to hit 8 than /as.... even though I'm a fast typist,
thats one third the time.

Now every one of my characters has the 8 key
on every bank set as /assist

I know that most of them would benefit from
a targetted assist with the MA's name on it, but
I put that key in a different slot, I'm so very used
to the utility of that generic assist and have it
hardwired into my brain that that is the 8 key....
