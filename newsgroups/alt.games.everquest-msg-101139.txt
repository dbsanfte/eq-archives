You call that a premium? Truly, it is to laugh.

I'm paying US$1,100 a month for a small one-bedroom and I'm getting a
good deal for my neighborhood. A 3-bedroom would go for a *minimum* of
US$3,000 and it wouldn't be a nice one.

You don't know premium rents until you've lived in a city ravaged by
rent control.
