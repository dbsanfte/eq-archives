From a vast distance, maybe.

AE groups tend to be in the bad habit though of "accidently" pulling thier
20 mobs at once past any other group that actually dares to hunt in the same
zone as them.... if they're really nice, they may bother to rez thier
victims afterwards, but generally not.   After all, stopping for that many
rezes would slow down thier uber exp and negate the whole point...  And if
the other group leaves after a death or two, whee!  More mobs to pull.

They pretty much do.   Lion patriarchs wander, when they are rooted they
don't anymore.   They will also stare at the closest person on the hate list
intently.  So, if they're sitting next to a group glaring at the group, it's
a pretty safe assumption it's rooted.

Also, if you aggro pull it and it doesn't follow, then it's obviously
rooted.  Go find the next one instead.
