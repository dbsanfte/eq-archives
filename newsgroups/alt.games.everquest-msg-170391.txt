hehe, i'm one of those that solos, and I also think that every little bit of
healt helps, run1 might be my next aa after Regen3 but i'm in no rush, I
plan to enjoy the game as a 51 reaver for a lil while, just how I am. Been
playing 2 1/2 years, if i can wait this long for 51 i can wait even longer
for run3 and any other season. <smiles>
