Here is a tip you can use in your future dealings with druids. I will be 
happy to port you for free, if I can spare the time and the mana, and I 
feel your need is pressing. If you offer to pay, though, come up with a 
reasonable amount. Three platinum *is* insulting. No one would offer to 
port you if you were offering to pay three platinum, so you may as well be 
honest and auction: "I'm flat broke and I cannot donate, but still I would 
very much like a port to WC". *I* would pick you up if I were headed that 
way and I heard that, or even if I were doing nothing at the time. While 
I'm more than happy to jump at the odd 200pp port offer, I do charity ports 
all the time.

The fact that three platinum was perhaps half of your money at the time is 
of no significance whatsoever.
