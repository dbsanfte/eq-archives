  Life with the Council is fun.Groups can be built easily. But our raid
leader works
weekends, so we have taken to mostly raiding weekdays, when *I* work.
Sometimes
you just can't win...
  Wednesday I got lucky; I logged on in Karnors with Rabotev to check VS -
yes, he
was up, as I had expected. The guild was mostly in Kael; raid leader
reported Vindi at
25% - oops, I wazs too late. Well, I could get in on the cleanup.
  Absurdly, the raid wipes with Vindi at 0%. Adas is handily in time to help
ferry people
back to Kael, we recover, clear repops, and pull Vindi again. This time he
dies flawlesly,
no deaths. Raid was about 22 people, Council and some from SGA guilds. The
breastplate
went to one of our shamen. A fine experience.
  A few hours later, a patch. Next day, yup, VS is up due to server reset,
but there is little
hope of getting him any time soon, methinks. Not so: that night, I see no
one has seen fit
to try him, Venril Sathir is still up. I report this to the guild and a few
close friends are
willing to help. Then, just for the heck of it, I check my friends list -
Kam is taking his
sweet time quitting the game; his characters are logged in. I tell him I
want to try VS,
he brings the whole crew from work! Venril Sathir is going DOWN.
  We get to Karnor's. Kam's guild management tool isn't working well, he
gets aggravated
when my guildies don't listen to his order to /raiddisband for another
formation try, but
we eventually get it formed and go in. VS goes down faster than ever, and
Adas has the second piece of her epic. Now all she needs is the Phinny
piece...which Kam has one of
for MQ.
  Friday, Kam isn't on. Nor Saturday. But the guild is happy to help Rabotev
with Ulump
Pujluk. I was expecting a half-hour battle, but Ulump dosen't seem to have
all that many
hp; he goes down, and I'm ready for Faydedar.

  Saturday, prime time, the main event: Inny in Nadox. My first attempt at
him. Things go
smoothly, we invis down to the High Priest's room and clear everyone but the
High Priest
himself. Inny pops, we pull him...and some adds from the corridor outside
jump in. We wipe.
  OK, try again. Tricky to pull our corpses out of the room: our SK has 20
coffins on him
...all on his body, not in the bank. We are able to get his corpse out of
the room, and
rez everyone. Move basck down to the room before Inny, this time we clear
the corridor
and try to fight him in there, since the initiates and diciples in the High
Priest room have
repopped. Fail again: we get him to 25%, but still wipe.
  Now some poeple are getting frustrated; there are calls to wait a few
days, try Inny
with a fresh start. The "one last try" people prevail, and we clear as much
from the room
and corridor as we can before pulling Inny himself. By this time I have
found I can only
land spells on him if cast from melee range, like a dragon fight, so I brave
the gflux AE
(a mere 100 points of damage, but it does interrupt my casts) and chain-nuke
him. He
kills me at 1%, just before I can finish him with a Stike of Solusek I know
will be good
for 3%. Fortunately, we had just enough people left alive to finish him.
Hurray! My first
Innoruuk kill! Love conquers Hate!
  Drops included a couple of things no one wanted; I took an ear piece,
another thing was
announced to the zone and taken by someone xp'ing. Healea/Jenaii was much
loved
after the kill, for keeping the last few people alive at the end. Or maybe
she got the killshot.
The guild gains more glory. There's talk of Paffa next, though some may need
Grummus
flagging first.
  Now, to log on and see what mischief we can make today...
