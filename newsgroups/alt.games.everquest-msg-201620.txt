My old RPG group still gets together every other week or so, unfortunately, 
I now live abou 2000 miles away from them.  Our preference was generally 
Chivalry & Sorcery for a system for fantasy, Hero (originally Champions) 
for most other types (comic book heroes, sci fi).  I have not looked around 
here, as I find that EQ mostly fills that spot.
