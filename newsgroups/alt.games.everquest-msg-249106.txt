And yet, despite the crowing of the ultracasual player that this new
easy watered down game is much better (like yourself), EQ's population
has never grown with that attitude in place, not to any great degree.
EQ's greatest gains came during the velious and earlier eras, when all
the instant gratification stuff you love so much was still
non-existant.

Maybe you should think a little on that and see what that might mean,
hmm?

That tired argument keeps getting dragged out from time to time. It
remains as bogus now as it was then. A mmorpg experience is not
something that can be isolated in such a way. The game is now balanced
and constructed in such a way that mass instant transport is expected,
and for immersiveness to be a factor it has to apply to everyone. You
can't just "turn it off for yourself", regardless of what you might
think.

It continued to slide towards concentrated unrelieved grinding being
the only thing considered "uptime" while removing any semblance of
"world", which means local variations in player populations and
situations and the exoticness of places.

Of course, I don't expect someone who freely admits they were hoping
for a D&D version of Quake to have any idea what I am talking about.
