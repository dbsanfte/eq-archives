So using root/rot is more intelligent and using the more manna intensive
"burn" spells is not so intelligent?

If so, why did they bother to give Druids burn-type spells at all? I can't
believe they actually sat down and said "We'll give the Druids some good
spells and some bad spells, then see if they're smart enough to figure out
which is which." They must have expected us to use them in at least some
circumstances.

By my reckoning, the Druid was created to be a "generalist" class. They can
do a little of everything, but none of it as well as a specialist would. The
idea that root/rot is the "correct" way to play a Druid is a player-invented
strategy based on their experience with the conditions that existed at the
time. KEI has changed those conditions, and in my opinion, restored the
Druid to the "jack-of-all-trades" he should have been in the first place.
