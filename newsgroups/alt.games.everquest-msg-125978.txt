i installed eq on my laptop (dell latitude c800, 512MBs, p3 1GHz, ati
mobility m4, 15" UXGA) and it sucked ass.  not so much because the
laptop couldn't handle it, but because the max refresh on the screen was
only 60Hz (it doesn't flicker, you just get choppy video).  i don't
think a better video card would help.  check the manufacturer for the
specs of their screen to see if you should even bother if you'd get a
cheaper laptop except to play EQ.
