   My necro has a skill of 50+, gotten from begging from the
fisherman at the Freeport docks while waiting for the boat
to take me to sister island.  In all that time, I've never
gotten a copper from the wench.  On the plus side, she's
never aggroed me either for it.  I kinda doubt its value as
taunt.
    As for money, well, its much better just to beg from
other players.  Preferably in /tell, from several zones
away.
