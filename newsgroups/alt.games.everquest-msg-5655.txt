You're scaring me!


OT aside, I did play with a couple at a pet store after my cat died.
They were cute, and suitably cranky at being awakened (oddly,
crankiness in pets is a trait I enjoy), but they didn't seem like a
proper replacement for a cat. Plus, at $100 each, I'd rather just
drive out to any of the countless farms in my area and get a free
kitten.
