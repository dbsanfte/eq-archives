In addition to the posts here, there's a couple things in CC that give
cold resist - frostone stein +20sv cold (off those terror things),
crystal web shield +10sv cold (off queen).

For fire, laced veil +5sv fire. I can't remember where it drops,
though. I thought I had more, but I'm drawing a blank.

Jewelry will get you a good way. Diamond/BD stuff is always desired,
but the cheaper, specific resist pieces, may be all you need.
