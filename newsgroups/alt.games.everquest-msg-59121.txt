You know, I'd rather pull one of my own fingernails out than to agree with
Dennis about anything but it's my opinion that one of his earlier comments
is correct.

He said that the sole purpose of PvE is to get ready for RvR.

What else is there to do?  What's to look forward to?  As much as people
bitch about EQ being med/kill/med/kill, DAOC is EXACTLY the same in that
regard in PvE.  Do you get new skills?  Casters don't...nothing exciting.  I
don't know about melee but I THINK they're done getting new stuff around
level 10.

What's left?  Why continue to play if not to see how well you can defend
your realm.  Here's a snip from the first paragraph of the first answer in
their faq ("What is Dark Age of Camelot"):

"Set in the Kingdom of Albion in the years immediately following the death
of King Arthur, players of the game enter a world in chaos, where Arthur's
peace has been shattered and dark forces threaten the Kingdom. Unlike
traditional role-playing games in which a player's greatest challenge is
fighting computer-controlled monsters, players in Camelot will come
face-to-face with their greatest challenge yet, other players. In Camelot,
players must choose to be members of one of the three Realms that are
striving for mastery in this chaotic world: The Britons, the Celts, or the
Norse."

RvR IS what DAOC is about.  Absolutely, most of the things about PvE are
more fun than EQ.  Absolutely, tradeskills are done RIGHT.

You enter the game at level 1 and specialize at level 5.  What is your
reward for getting to level 20?  There IS none.  YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT
EQ.  EQ had me hooked because if I played just a LITTLE longer I'd hit level
<whatever> and get this cool new spell or skill.

Will I continue to play DAOC?  Sure, my best friend is playing and it's a
nice distraction when I don't feel like playing EQ.  And not feeling like
playing EQ is happening more lately though if my friend isn't in DAOC at the
time I'm fairly likely to just watch TV or read a book.  I'll be canceling
my 2nd account though...a bard tradeskill consignment mule.
