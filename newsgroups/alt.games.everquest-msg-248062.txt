Currently have a Shaman and Warrior both at lvl 27.  I do have access to a 3rd 
account and was thinking I'd like to try adding a 3rd character and try 
3-boxing.  So far the Shm-War duo is great.  With this combo I'm missing 
Snare, CC, Rezzes, and Evacs.  My first thought is to add a Wizard so I could 
get Snare and Evacs.  I also figured the Wizard would be easy since I wouldn't 
have to watch him constantly.  Just flip over to him when I want a killshot or 
when I need to evac.  Any other suggestions or is the Wizzy the way to go?
