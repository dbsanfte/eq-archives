I have tanked LDONs :) I usually like LDONs because I can step up and 
melee.

Last night, our pally could not seem to pull less than 5 at a time. We 
wiped/zoned several times and no matter what he couldn't pull less than 5 
or so. We finally lost after the time ran out and we were halfway to our 
Collect 20. 

I really need 65 bad. With my ex being a monk, Pacification would make me 
an excellent puller I think.
