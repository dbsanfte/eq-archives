Yes, they do cross the port areas at times. Uncommon, but it does
happen. If your just porting there your fine, but once we did an evac
to skyfire and it was a bit problematic when a wurm was there. Nobody
was SOW'd because we were in a dungeon. We lost two people before we
killed it not because it was a vicious MoB, but because we were
already damaged and low on mana. Lucky we had a cleric with us for
rez. To suggest Skyfire is a safe an evac as Lavastorm is absurd.
