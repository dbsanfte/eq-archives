We have come to an understanding. After finding him the very first green NPC
i'd happened across, i promptly killed him, just to see what it felt like.
Well, i felt pretty guilty so, whenever im in Nro, i now have made a point of
heading on down to see him while i fish and regain mana. Typical day would go

You say "Hya Puntar hows things?"
You say "Quiet day huh?"
