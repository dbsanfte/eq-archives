Can anybody give me a general rule concerning completing a quest and
'faction'.

I am getting ready to complete 'Aegis of life' cloak quest and 'ethereal
long sword west(in Katta)' and I am desperately afraid I will turn in the
correct items and get nothing in return.



    Can you assume that if NPC gives you quest you have adequate faction
(assuming the same NPC will be given quest items).



       Or Is it trial and error. You have to learn from others failures.

Or is there a level of faction that is in general sufficient to complete
quests

i.e. indifferent?  Amiable?
