Yep, I have taken several of my characters to 23 working my way in, and 
to the Shriknar.  I always just eat any deaths, even at 23, it takes one 
to two kills to regain the xp in Paludal.  At 23 or so, the bandits 
become the only viable option in Paludal, and I have soloed them some 
when it's not crowded (yes, it does happen sometimes).
