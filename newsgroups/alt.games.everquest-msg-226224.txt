Yes:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/eqemu

However, there isn't really a lot of point to it.  EQ is an MMORPG
(Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game).

If you want a single player game, or a game where you and a small group of
friends can play together on your own server, there are many many many other
games designed for this, which will be far more enjoyable than EQ.
Depending on what aspect of EQ interests you, you'll probably be happier
with one of the following than an EQ server emulator hack:

    Neverwinter Nights
    Morrowind
    Dungeon Siege
    ...and many more, plus a zillion console games
