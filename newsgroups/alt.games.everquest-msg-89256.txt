Don't get too discouraged, this is your first character I assume, you just
have to face the fact that you will not be able to compete with the twinks
for gear.  If I were you, I would just keep playing, have fun, look into
quests and drops that you can reasonably get as you level.  That's what I
did with my shaman.  Eventually I joined a guild with friends I made in EQ,
started getting some of their cast offs, and started being able to raise
cash to buy some of my own gear.  I, in turn, have given away a lot of my
old equipment as well, as I outgrew it.  One quest I would look into soon is
the Testament of Vanear, it is a very nice secondary slot item, I still have
mine at level 48.  I am hoping to replace it soon with a shield from Luclin,
but it's a very nice item for the level you can obtain it at.  I don't
recall what level you will need to be to complete the quest solo.
