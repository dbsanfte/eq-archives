Hmmmm.....that's funny.  Honestly I've never tried it myself; Sol Ro
and minis are the last pre-elemental flags on my list.  I wonder what
the problem was with Richard's raid, then?

With CoDb I know that it's a non-physical key, anyway - thus the key
AND flag comment.  Very weird, tho.  Leave it to SoE to complicate
things unnecessarily. :)

Very odd....yeah, we're slated to do Sol Ro, soon.  No more sitting
outside the zone waiting for enough flagged people to join the raid.
:) Even though I'm usually one of the first to get in since I'm a
cleric, it's still frustrating having to wait and being afraid that,
if someone goes LD, you might get booted from the zone. :)  Thank god
I'm done with that in Earth, Air, and Water already.
