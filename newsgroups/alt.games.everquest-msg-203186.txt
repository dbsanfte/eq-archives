Last week my friends and I were in the factory & decided to talk to some NPC
(a "Researcher" I think his title was).  It wasn't the gnome in the first
room.

We had no idea what we were doing, and fully expected to die, but it was
something new, so what the heck. :)

We were ported to another room with no way out, and we started the event and
did die during the 4th or 5th wave of clockwork bugs.  We asked friends in a
couple of the uberguilds on Zeb (LD & IL) and the answer we resoundingly
received back was "huh??"

Allakhazam doesn't mention the event starter in bestiary, nor in quests by
zone.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.
