Assuming we're talking about the same thing, (and I think we are) it's
worth pointing out to the OP that the breakdown rates on that conversion
in the forge are total ass.  I think there's *one* size block or brick,
(the smallest) that will result in two "pieces" of stackable ore. (The
pieces are what you want in the end for most recipies anyway, and they
stack which cuts down the weight factor a lot). Unfortunately, when you
break down larger bricks and blocks in the forge, rather than getting
two of the next smaller size, you only get one. You'd think that if you
started with large blocks, that had to be broken to small blocks, then
to bricks, then to pieces, you'd wind up with eight pieces, right?
BZZZT. You only get three.

/sigh

But three is still better than two, I guess, and the stacking and weight
issue makes it worthwhile.

Oh, and to do this, you'll need a smithing skill (quite low, less than
fifty I'm almost sure) and a special velium chisel. You can buy it only
in Thurgadin or Shadowhaven as I recall. Check EQ TRaders for details.
