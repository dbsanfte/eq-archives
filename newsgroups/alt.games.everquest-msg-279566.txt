All I'm saying is that buying and selling services has been part of
the game from the beginning.  I remember sitting by the gates of
Qeynos as a young druid hoping to make the odd plat binding people,

asked for money but I didn't turn it down either, unless a traveler
looked like they had just tossed me their last copper.
