Found out an interesting thing this week. Just dinged 27 with the lizard
monk and gained Disarm. All the original guides I'd seen for catching it
up involve finding an orc pawn, disarming it, and then handing the weapon
back. Well, since you can't hand it back any more without charming it,
that route doesn't really work.

Anyway, I discovered that if a mob has a magic weapon, although you can't
successfully disarm it, you *can* get skill ups off the attempts!

So I picked out a (quite green to me) greater scalebone in Kurn's. They
often have a magic, no drop, lore Femur that acts as a piercing weapon
(looks like they're carrying a wand if they've got one). Pulled him and
backed into a quiet corner.  Turned off autoattack, and just hit Disarm
for about an hour to bring Disarm from 50 to 150. When I'd capped off the
skill, I killed him for his efforts and looted a sweet, sweet, Bone Chips!
Got in a nice chat with mom, too!

I'm not twinked by any means (wearing cured silk and wu's), but between
natural iksar regen, Focused Will, and Mend, I had no trouble staying at
near full health the entire time. Couldn't say how well this works for
other disarming classes or races, but it might be worth a try.

It was also interesting that Disarm does not break Focused Will like most
other offensive skills do...


Anyway, this original tip was not gleaned from any stupid websites, like
www.inanegapingstrageties.com, but can only be found *exclusively* on
USENET!  Please send me plat, ingame, not because this tip is useful, but
because, I'm just a really cool lizard, you know? :)
