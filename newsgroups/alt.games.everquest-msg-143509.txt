I definitely won't mind it for exp groups though.   Depending on how well it
works, it could cut out some serious mana wasting on healing my warrior.
(We often have 1 druid as the only healer for exp groups.)   I have enough
hit points with just druid buffs that I'll get the full 3000, and 3000 for
400 mana doesn't sound very bad, compared to 976 for 440.

Just to drag the conversation away from the raiding aspect for a bit.
