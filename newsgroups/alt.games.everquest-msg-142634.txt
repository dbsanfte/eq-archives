Exactly.

Furthermore, DT's error on this thread is not in subscribing to one
view or another (since as you point out they both have some merits).
His error in declaring that his view is so "obviously" correct and that
any other viewpoint is so "obviously" based on "irrelevant" factors
that he is appearing more than a bit belligerently puerile.

And it doesn't help that he's coupling it with an attitude that is
far more accurately described by the phrase "strutting around doing some
kind of Superior Dance" than those whom he accuses of such.

It's one thing to argue for/against some particular position.
It's another thing entirely to repeatedly denounce opposing views
as somehow bone-headedly idiotic, irrelevant, or infuriating.

The former is how adults discuss things.  The latter...
