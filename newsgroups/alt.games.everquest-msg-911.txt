STR is important to a point...you need enough to carry your armor.  It's
also a fairly easy one to bump up with jewelry and items.  I'd start with
about 85 minimum and try to get up to about 100.

CHA is important at upper levels, but CHA is also pretty easy to bump with
items and jewelry.  I'd recommend a minimum of 75 at birth.

DEX is not important to a bard

AGI is always nice
STA may be important at lower levels, but Jig O' Vigor can make up for a
lot.

Read the links Pierce gave ya...tell me if I'm full of it after. :)
