If you have Windows 2000 and a VooDoo 5, it's even easier.  First, before
you start EQ, bring up your task manager by pressing Ctrl-alt-del(do this
before you start EQ, or the keys will lock when you go back into EQ).  With
the task manager up, start EQ as normal.  Select your character, and when
you need to med, or are on a boat ride, hit your windows key and you will be
kicked to the desktop, however, EQ will still be running in the background.
When you want to go back into EQ, select it on your task manager and hit
"switch to"  Poof, back into EQ.  The only downside is that any action you
take while out of EQ, will also effect EQ, for example typing
www.smutfest.com in your web browser will result in you also typing it into
your chat window, and those around you will think you are quite weird.  I
have not been able to duplicate this with GeForce installed.
