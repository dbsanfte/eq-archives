I bought Everquest Evolution last March and installed it hoping to be
sucked into the legend.  Well, I found there were 5 addon-packs with
this package and when I logged in, there was no real direction.  I
didn't get a tutorial and I didn't know what to do other than gather
animal parts after killing them for profit.  A slow and boring way to
level.  I tried to ask for help and occassionally a spell came my way
[and I was grateful], but I was simply bored.  I didn't last the month.

Well, a couple of days ago, I decided to reinstall Everquest Evolution
and give it another try.  Well, I was impressed [for $12.95 I should be
;-)].  This time, a tutorial came up and walked me through what I
needed.  Well, I have been playing Half-Life 2 and am impressed with the
graphics.  So, after seeing tree trunks in Everquest with angular edges,
I couldn't help wonder how nice Everquest 2 would be.  I contemplated
World of Warcraft, but in the end, I figure any disadvantage to
Everquest would go away over time.  Well, I bought it and installed it.
Boy am I impressed!  Graphics are awesome (P4-3.06GHz, 1024MB 1066RIMM,
ATI Radeon 9700Pro 128MB)!  Zones move quickly and I am not left with
any doubt as to what I can be doing.  From a newbie perspective, it has
been a real treat.  I will add that I am only up to the point where I
need to group with some other players on newbie island and go slay the
orc.

Anyway, as of yesterday, I was quite addicted, running about 3 hours of
play until 11:30PM [up at 5:45AM this morning].  I can't wait to get
back to the game tonight.  I am just awed by the compleixity of this
world.
