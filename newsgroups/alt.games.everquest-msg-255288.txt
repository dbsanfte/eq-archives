    http://www.coldfuryguild.com/ - Australian guild on my server, is in
Qvic/Inktu'ta. There's only two zones beyond those, only a handful of guilds
are in the final one, and those guilds have made almost no progress against
the 5 K+ quadding yard trash or stuff like the 8 K flurry boss. So, they're
pretty much as far into the end game as anyone else. I seem to recall at
least one other advanced Aussie guild being out there, but I can't recall
their name.

    Stupidly overpowered droppables are usually released every so often to
allow people that drop behind to keep up. Example: Velium Gemmed weapons.
Dirt cheap, they allow you to skip everything pre-PoP (and a lot of PoP
content as well) and be right up-to-date with melee damage. Looks like OoW
will use the PoP model for spells, so casters will be able to get their
spells.

    At this point we recruit mostly from each other. Nobody likes reflagging
raids, and the second tier of guilds are nowhere near ready to do the
necessary raids.
