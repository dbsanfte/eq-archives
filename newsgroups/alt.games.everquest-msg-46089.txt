In case you didn't see this posted on the Sony boards, it was hilarious!

It plays nicely in Windows Media Player. The creator of the film put
some heavy metal music in the background which is really appropriate.
Anyway, it's a full blown uberguild raid in ToV where, sadly, four
different boss style dragons get pulled at once.
I'd love to know how to make these movies.
