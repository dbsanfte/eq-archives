Does the motherboard have built in sound hardware?  Do you use it or a
PCI sound card?  If the answer to the first question is yes and the
second "PCI sound card" make sure you have disabled the built in sound
hardware in BIOS settings.  If the answers were yes and yes do the same
but buy a PCI sound card too <G>.  Well only after testing it out with
built in disabled (yes you'll have no sound but if you can zone now then
you know it was the motherboard sound components causing the problem.)

May not apply to you, but this is what I had to deal with on last PC I
built for home use.
