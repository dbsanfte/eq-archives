yes m'lord, you are able to do what ever you want in life.... and reap
what you sew....   
now that we have had this discussion... do you see that Chanter in my
case is not lazy... but rather a term of affection?  If I was in a
group with you and called you a chanter and you said... hey I dont
like that.... I would attempt to refrain from continuing to do so to
you.... Is it this easy to step on your toes in RL?

May your mezzes(doh should I spell out he whole name of the spell)
never drop, and your mana ever be full...

Loving all those Enchanters out there.... (see I have attempted to not
pet the cat the wrong way)
