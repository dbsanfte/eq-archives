What they are talking about is what the Antitrust bill in the US is
designed to attack.  Collusion.

Lets imagine Deadbob and Deadjane are the only two SK at the raid.
Ubertoothpick of Doom (SK only) drops.

Deadbob /tells Deadjane "Hmm, I'd spend 25 points for that
Deadjane /tell Deadbob "Oh I'd spend 50!"
Deadbob /tell Deadjane "OK you take it then"
Deadjane /1 bid 1 point
Flusteredlootofficer /1 any other bids?

Hmm, instead of a bidding war that would have ended somewhere over
the 25 point area, the cunning Deadjane just spends one point.

In the meantime, the less clever, more numerous and more greedy warriors
get in a war over "Notsobad Herring of Annoyance" and bid what normally
would be a 12 point item up to 57 points spent.

Now the "Astonishing Breastplate of Total Utter Glitteryness" drops,
War/SK only item.  Due to a long habit of colluding on bids, Deadbob
and Deadjane both have several hundred points banked, while the
warriors all have less than 57 to their names.  Of course it could get ugly
except that DB and DJ are still colluding, so they know who would bid
highest... only thing they have to do is outbid the top pointed warrior,
so instead of 200 points whichever wins it walks off with it for 57

Having assigned point values for items, or at least assigned minimum point
values for items, means that this can't happen.  Sadly it also means that some
decent but not astonishing items will rot when people refuse to spend the
set minimum, saving up for something really good.  It also doesn't prevent
collusion from making all items for a given class go for the minimum... which
is where the "set value" plan starts to look good.  Now the item is awarded
to the highest point value person who wants it, and its set cost is deducted
from
his total.  This also saves a lot of time versus a bidding war.
