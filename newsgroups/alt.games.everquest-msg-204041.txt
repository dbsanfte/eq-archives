: I am honestly confused by the amount of negitive reaction that my post has

: I will say once again that this was a bit of a joke, but I really don't
see

:
: In responce to Biz "That'd be fun, huh?" comment, well I spend a lot of

While
: the bazzar tool is good it is not that good, and if there was an easier
way
: for me to search and buy and sell, then yes it would make that aspect of
: the game more fun for me.
:
: This could be done in game or out of game IMO. Since in game what I
: generally do is sit in trader mode looking at the ground and using the
: (slightly clumsy) bazzar tool, then occasionally having a laggy wander to
: find a (invariably half hidden) character on the other side of the zone.
:
: At this point I get to interact ! I click on them and buy something ! Then
: I sit back down put trader back on and start browsing again.
:
: Other than the laggy graphics and the walk across zone what would the
: difference be between this and a web page or standalone tool ? (if it was
: going to be a serious suggestion then I would require that people log out
: in the bazzar to use it)
:
: There are some serious suggestions on how they could improve the bazzar :
:
: As others have said turn off pets familiers spell casting songs etc. in
the
: bazzar to reduce lag.
:
: Improve the /bazzar tool so that you can do things like :
: Have more refined queries, like only list items that give XXX more than
: yyy. (This would be very useful for weapons)
:
: Have the ability to save queries (like you can with spell set-ups), I
think
: that half my time is sepnt toggling the drop downs to switch from looking
: for xxxx to looking for yyyy
:
: Add more options into the type box (tradeskills bing the most obvious)
:
: One thing I would love to see would be a WTB feature. Have it so you can
: set yourself up wanting to buy this many of this item at this price. The
: system can check that you have the money and slots available. Then people
: could give you the item to receive the cash.
:
: I can understand the desire for the game to be immersive, but the bazzar
: just isn't and if you made it immersive in any real way it would become
: such a pain to use that people just wouldn't.

To a point, I agree with you.  I took most of what you said as
tongue-in-cheek and my response was, also.  I would have no real problem
with off-line trading *if* you had to camp out in a specific zone to buy, as
well as sell.  That way you would not need a laggy zone to move around in
and you would need to go to "the store" to buy things (so they did not
magically move to or from your char sitting in LGuk/Nadox/PoT/etc.).  Also,
they would need to have a way to kick people out after a set time limit or
be pushed out by new traders if there is a limit to the number of traders in
the bazaar (more like a flea market) at one time.
