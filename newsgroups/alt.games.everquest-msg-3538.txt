Oddly enough, being a software developer working for the DoD does not
preclude me being enlisted in the USAF.  My skills are such that if I
had chosen to re-locate from where I presently live I would be making
quite a comfortable salary(80-100k), however I like my location, and
chose to continue to do what I love where I love.  

Bah, Just because I don't bathe in money does not mean I am not a
professional.  Nor is my personal income any of your business, I shall
simply say that I am not living "hand to mouth", nor am I living
extravagantly
