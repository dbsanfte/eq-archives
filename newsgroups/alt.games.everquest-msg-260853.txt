I wish we had a Complete cure in Final Fantasy....

Cause cures do damage to undead... <Thwack>
But anyway, wouldn't you want a nuke there? Or that dot... you are 
fighting undead, right?

I understand, I was just trying for a lame joke. I mean, would you wear 
a +35 int, +25wis, +25 chr, 1 ac helm

The idea is you can loot uber phat lewt and sell it, that they don't 
want to be mudflationary. I guess. In Wow almost every drop worth 
putting on was Soulbound when equipped... Only soulbound when picked up 
items I saw were, as I said, quest items.

Also, I think one of the group loot modes is master loot. Someone loots 
everything, then passes out to the deserving.
