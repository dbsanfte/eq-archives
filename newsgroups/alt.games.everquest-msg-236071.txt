I don't know what you pay for a phone, but I can assure you, if my
phone was out for a week, I would NOT be paying that portion of the
bill, and yes it would get pro rated out.   I have to pay for a metro
line because I live in the suburbs (or else it would be long distance
anytime I called into H town).  My basic monthly phone bill is round
100$.  now that's approx 25$ I will get refunded if the service was
out for a week.  now service out for a day or a few hours... there
would be no concern about getting a refund.
