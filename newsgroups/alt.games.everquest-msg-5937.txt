I know what you're talking about. I was running a dwarven cleric and
some high level dwarf gave me some all around awesome stuff. At the
time, I was busy doing something, so I thanked him kindly, assuming
that anything he gave me was his discards...good stuff, but not THAT
good. Well, I was wrong, and I felt real bad because he had waited a
moment after he gave it to me, obviously waiting for me to realize
what I had gotten. I never gave him the satisfaction of the overly
enthusiastic "THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!!!" that he so richly deserved.
Heck, I didn't even really look at it until the next time I logged on
because I was called away soon after.
