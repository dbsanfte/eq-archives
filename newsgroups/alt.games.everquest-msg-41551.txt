This, however, is 100% false.  Anyone in a guild with more than 10 people, or
those that hang out in populated zones, will still be able to say "Hey, did
you drop?"  "Yeah, me too!" "ditto!".  So it won't change a damn thing in that
respect.  Verant knows this, and I'm sure doesn't care because THEY DON'T
INTENTIONALLY HIDE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG ON THEIR END.

Enough with this "They just want to lie to us!  And now they're chasing me
with black helicoptors because I KNOW THE TRUTH!" paranoia bullshit.

In my 2.5 years of playing, I have never seen them deny that it was their
problem when it appeared to be.  They've owned up to it every single time.  On
the times when the Idiots With No Clue(tm) bitch in chat because Verant must
be lying because "Everyone" (i.e. 1/10th) just dropped, well, they're not
worth listening to anyway.  I can't even count the times when they've said "A
router is having trouble, we're looking into it" or "CERF net is having
connectivity problems" or "A router in chicago is causing problems, no ETA"
(because it's out of their hands) and stuff like that.  If you look into it,
they're telling the truth.  I have seen no pattern of them distorting the
facts when it comes to connectivity.  Maybe they have some sub par people in
chat who don't know the story, and make it worse by guessing (or blaming
individual ISP's) but I haven't seen much of that either.

And if you think Verant gives their users that little credit, you're an
imbecile.  If populations in Lake of Ill Omen went from 100 per night to 200
per night, every night, people would notice.  Especially when it's repeated
throughout every zone.  Verant isn't that stupid.  Not to mention the fact
that, umm, people talk to each other and I don't think folks from the other
server would hide that they're suddenly on a different server.  Stop making up
these idiotic scenarios, you're embarrassing yourself.
