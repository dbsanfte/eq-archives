    And here is the heart of the difference of our views on this matter, I
think. When I meet an avatar in online game, I do see them as people. 
Sure, they could be roleplaying.  Sure, they could be evil in game and
sweet in real life, or vise versa, but the words and actions of the avatar
are still being controlled by a real person in real time.  I react to the
person, in the game, as presented in the MMORPG.  If for some reason I ever
met this person in real life I could very well modify my opinion of their
status as a friend to me depending one what new information I gleamed about
their true character from them.  But in game I am willing to take them at
face value (so to speak) an interact with them, as people, some of the as
friends, with such information as they are able to provide.

   Yep.  I would probably blow him off in a second.

   The roleplaying aspect wouldn't faze me for a sec.  If he was a jerk to
me, laying it all at the feet of roleplaying wouldn't matter to me.  He
controls the actions of his avatar, and if I know that the person who
controls an avatar chose to be jerk to me, then I react to that person's
actions, regardless of the reasons for them.

   I guess you give this matter much more thought than I do.  That's ok.  I
know I'm pretty shallow in matters like this.  I don't really think too
much about the differences between real persona and role-played ones.  I
mean, if some dark elf ran up to my high elf on Firiona Vie and started
telling her how insipid and vile they think she is (and this has happened
more than one) then I would/did take a mental step backwards and assume
that they are roleplaying and not take offense.

   I work with what I have, in whatever venue.

  Ok, on this I would agree.  If I had what a I considered to be a good
friend in EQ, and they suddenly and for no apparent reason blew me off,  I
would be much less upset by this than if the same thing had happened with a
friend I knew in real life.  For me, while online friendships are possible,
they are much more shallow than other friendships can be, at least until
there is more ooc/real life interaction of some sort.

   No slight taken.  I have no problem knowing that other people have
different worldviews from me, and I think it's interesting to get a glimpse
of these views, to see how the contrast with mine.  I don't really think
that in this discussion one of us is right or one of us is wrong.  We just
see things a bit differently.

   Good.  Cause I know that I'm the one wading in the shallow end of the
pool in this matter.
