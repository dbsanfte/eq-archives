*GASP!* DAMN THOSE VILE FIENDS FOR MAKING A PROFIT! Jesus, if people
want to dump money transferring, let them. Nobody's forcing it. If you
don't want to give SOE more money than you already are, don't. Simple,
huh?

Anybody who thinks a "newbie server" is really going to be any better
is pathetically naive. Stromm went to hell in only a few months and is
now just like every other server out there.

Besides, anyone who assumes it's a "newbie server" despite the fact
that, not only did SOE not say a damn thing to imply such, but
flat-out said they'd be allowing transfers is a total moron.
