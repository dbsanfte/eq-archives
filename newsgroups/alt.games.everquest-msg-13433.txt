To compound this, some people are learning some things, like .com, .bat,
.exe, but missing others, like .pif.  Then cram on top the double extension
trick being used by many viruses.  I have seen things that say "Take a look
at this cute photo:"  And the attachment is FUNNY.JPG.  However, if you have
your extensions turned on it will really be FUNNY.JPG.PIF, an executable
virus.

This is a combination of social engineering on top of a virus.  By
accounting for the fact that some people do know the basic precautions, they
use two extensions to hide the virus.  Even a .xls, .doc, or other office
file can have a virus in it, and thanks to the scripting engines this can be
used to download and run a more damaging executable.  Yes, thank you
Microsoft for linking the OS, Web and Office together into one nearly
seamless package that can be exploited in all new ways.

Now multiply all this by the poor advise of only trusting people you know.
Most of the rapid spreading viruses send to only two groups of people.  1)
The people in your address book.  2) The same people you send mail to.  So
the people you should trust the LEAST are the people you know.

If someone with skills were really wanting to attack EQ, they would need to
install some sort of a host program on the victim's computer.  By using one
of the assorted virus type attacks, they could do this.  Then they get a
copy of your data stream.  By passing this data stream through something
like ShowEQ they can get what is inside the packets.  All they need is the
first few minutes of your logging on to have the password in there
somewhere, so they do not need to bog down your connection by capturing
everything.

And now all they need to do is try and brute force their way through the pas
sword.  I'm not any where near an expert on how they will succeed in that,
but there is one tool they can use to help them, having an EQ account.  By
working on their own password, then changing it and working it again, they
can perfect a password decrypt method.  It takes time, but is possible.

Now, I would like you to just imagine the skills needed for this, and the
time it will take.  Fortunately for us, most of the people who have these
skills, and the time, and equipment, are not mad at Sony/Varant/EQ players.
They are mad at Bill Gates for being a half assed programmer who was lucky
enough to have his daddy rewrite the sales contract into a licensing
contract while IBM was under an anti-trust suit (and didn't want to own
anything else).  So most of the people with the ability to go after EQ
players at random, are busy going after other things.

My roommate has been playing EQ for a long time.  He has 3 characters in the
50+ zone, and a bunch of others he fools around with.  He has talked to all
sorts of guild members whenever there is a rumor of a hacked account.  Since
no member of their guild has had a hacked account, there is no real first
hand experience.  However, the few times they have heard something from a
reliable source, it was always something like Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Spouse
trouble where the irked significant other has logged on and given out the
account name and password, OR when the account info is given to a friend who
gives it to a friend who... and so on.  I would classify this as non-random
account hijacking.  Your account was hijacked by someone you knew, or by the
actions of someone you knew who spread your account  password on to others
you did not know.

My roommate has heard many claims of hacked accounts from people say they
were randomly hijacked, but every time the story would break down somewhere.
They claim that one day they logged on, and everything was gone.  They would
say that since they were hijacked and never shared their password, could
they get some PP or items?  Or they would make wild claims, and never be
heard from again.

Now I am NOT saying that random account hijacking has never happened.  All I
am relaying is that my roommate has never heard of one that could be
confirmed, or that at least sounded legitimate.  As for non-random
hijacking, if two people know something, it is not a secret.  Passwords
should be secret.

Another thing that would help in tracking these things, if they did actually
happen, would be for Varant to log the IP every time you connect.  Then they
could pass this information back to you during your next login.  If they
stored the last five logins, with the time stamp from their servers, then
your software would just need to add this to a log file on your machine, and
skip any duplicate logins.

Then if someone claimed that they had been hijacked, there would be a file
to send back to Varant for investigation.  You would probably only need to
store twenty to fifty logins on the client to see any trends.  The passing
back of the last five logins is so that the owner of the account would end
up with a record of the hijacker's connections.

This would be a double edged sword for "guild" account users.  If they
complain they could end up with a bunch of people being banned.  But then,
according to the Varant rules, there is no such thing as a "guild" account
allowed.

As for the victims of hijacking, it would give them some recourse against
the transgressor even if it would not get them back whatever they lost.

Frauds would be stopped because every whiner could be told to submit the log
file to Varant for action and to shut up.

The only people that might be hurt are those stupid enough to try an account
someone "loans" them.  They could then be victimized by a false report.  I
see this as the smallest group, and have no intent of playing other peeps
accounts on my machine, so it would not hurt me.

I think I have put in my $0.02 enough times to have a dollars worth of
comments.  Sorry I crossed so many threads in one message, but this is a
post after just reading many things.  News server was down for five days due
to a multi-drive failure in a RAID array.  ::sigh::
