Prepare to be burnt.

I'm a druid (NOT a dr00d), I HATE PORTING PEOPLE.  I don't give a flying
fuck if its "and emregency plz ill pay", I WILL NOT take time out from MY
playing to cut YOUR downtime, unless you're a friend or guildmate of mine,
or I'm in a porting mood, or I'm getting someone a rez or something similar.

And If I'm in a group that says I can't loot anything but autosplit money,
I'm out of there, druids are just as important as anyone else in a DL exp
group (in other words, completely optional).

Also, when's the last time you got experience for porting?  That's what I
thought.

This rant has been brought to you courtesy of the anti-dr00d.

Oh, and telling newbies in oasis who ask you for buffs to come meet you on
the spec isle is great fun, especially when they realize you're not trying
to get them killed.  =P  It also cuts the wheat from the chaff.
