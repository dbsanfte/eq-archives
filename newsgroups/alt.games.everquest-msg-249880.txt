Well, yes and no.  I am one of those people who *regularly* goes walking in the
desert and the woods.  And I regularly take my ranger out sightseeing in
Norrath.
But would I try to *insist* that all my friends go exploring down the lesser
known road?  Nah.  It would just aggravate them and they'd end up frustrated
and pissed off.  Some *want* excitement and fast experience.  It's more
important to them than seeing the spires in NK or watching the sunset at the
RyGorr Keep.
I'm cool with that.  They are cool with me chasing silly quests for Katta.
FWIW, I'm sometimes disappointed that *getting uber and 65* seems to be that
important to them, and I'm guessing that once they get to 65 and have a million
AAs they are going to be frustrated anyway, but that's a guess.
