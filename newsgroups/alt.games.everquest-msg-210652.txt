My old guild used to use a standardized message that put your position
number and the next cleric in it. i.e

1111 casting CH on < TANK >, BOB up NEXT 1111

This worked quite well for instantly knowing your position and who to
skip.

My new guild uses alphabetical order, so Aaguymade in the days of
alphaloot is always before Bob and Bob is before Charlie.

Both systems seem to work fairly well for covering LD's. The alpha
system is more flexible in that a spare cleric can declare they're
filling in for a LD and everyone immediately knows where they'll fit in
the chain. The other system was better in a guild with 3 or 4 good
clerics and another 5 or 6 that might eventually start casting by the
second or third time through the chain.
