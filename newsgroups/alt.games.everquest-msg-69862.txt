Probably. The Beastlord is a perfectly viable user for a fungal growth
tunic, since melees and shamans can both use them. I suspect
beastmaster was removed to keep too many people from leveling them up
too fast.

Of course, since the number of 46+ beastlords on right now is close to
zero, it would have been nice if they'd waited before adding NO DROP
beastlord armor to the planes.
