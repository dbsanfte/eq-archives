 Well I'm just guessing but I think by 'need' he means for them to be
effective they should be that range (55+). When you're fighting mobs
such as dragons that are red at 60 you know a 55 and under person is
going to take a lot of damage and probably be feared/stunned/whatever
most of the time. Taking a level 46 against a mob like Phara Dar....
He'd be basically worthless except to pick up the rot loot nobody wants.
In 'uber' encounters levels are key. Resists a close second unless the
mob is straight melee like Dain.
