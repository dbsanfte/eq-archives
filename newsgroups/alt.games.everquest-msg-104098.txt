Speaking as a 52 druid who's watched 50+ wizards dish out damage, I'm
going to have to say NO on that "wizards suck" thing.  They might not
be as versatile as druids, but in the end game they start become more
and more effective.

The most hellish amount of damage I've ever seen was when I got to be
grouped up with a 55 Wizard and a 60 Rogue on an Umbral raid.  We got
damned near EVERY SINGLE KILL.  That was one three man group against 3
full groups.  It was scary.
