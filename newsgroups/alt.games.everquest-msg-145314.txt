The point is every melee lowering themselves on the agro list, so that
should the MA die, the next person on the agro list will be the SA.

Heres an example for you.. yesterday when we killed the AoW, when the first
tank died, the fight panned out like this -
First tank dies
Monk gets agro. Monk dies
Paladin gets agro.  Paladin DA's and lives with <1 bub hp
Second tank gets agro.
AoW dies

The second and third people on the agro list were a monk and a paladin.. the
monk wasnt so surprising (he didnt have puller agro, i had pulled it, but
monks do a lot of damage fast).. but a paladin next?!?!  he hadn't used LoH
yet, so it was damage and proximity agro

Anyway my point is, Paladins and SK's are very similar in offensive terms
(SK probably a tad more offensive).. so if you think they don't get agro
because of a 2h, wel your very wrong.

why poor mans?   SK's get *TWO* different feign death spells, which are
independent of each other (feign death, and death peace).  That gives them 2
instant shots at FD, over a monks 1.
