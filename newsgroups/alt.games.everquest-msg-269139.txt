Heh, yeah, it kind of struck me as odd as well the moment I typed it, but 
IMO it fits. Of all the things EQ2 is supposed to be, I never saw 
competition as one. It may be appropriate for PvP, but it just seems out of 
place aside from that.

To each their own, I suppose. Suffice it to say I just don't care for it. I 
think it promotes the wrong type of mentality for this particular game. 

I *do* also like the Magelo-type service though.
