I think he was joking.

You also share the jade reavers and the DE Corruptor.  Probably other pieces
that I haven't been involved in.

Enchanters also have 3 planes and chardok.  Fear is a pain in the ass
(miniboss, rare spawn), Hate just requires you keep going until what you
need drops off a female revenant.  Sky is a piece of cake (don't have to
kill anything or aggro anything) but where Sky is easy for us/hard for
warriors, Chardok is the other way around.  Enchanters have to kill the
Prince, and he's a bitch.  Warriors kill one of his parents (can't remember
which) and I believe that just requires one group.

I'm almost there (enchanter)...just have the 7 tough ones to go, 4 that
aren't that hard but require more resources than my little guild, then Fear,
Hate, Prince.
