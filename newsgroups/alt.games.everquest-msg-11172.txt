That wasn't the general feeling on this newsgroup at the time.

As you can see if you read the thread, it wasn't very flattering to the
person who was purportedly banned. There doesn't seem to be any reason he
would make a story like that up, especially as it showed him in such a bad
light.

As far as I recall, no-one accused him of lying. Plenty of people in this
newsgroup and on the board where it was first posted, said he deserved to be
banned for his actions.

Of course, it may be a fabrication, but to what end?  One way to make sure,
might be to ask GM Zrinic.
