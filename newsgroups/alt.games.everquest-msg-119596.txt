Goto http://everquest.allakhazam.com/, they have a Quest list that is by
item.  See if your stuff is there and the factions involved in doing the
quest and what you get.  If you will never without massive work be able to
do the quest involving the item because of faction get rid of it.  If it
results in a no drop item that you can't use or don't want get rid of it.
If it results in an item you can sell then decide if the trouble of doing
the quest is worth what you will be able to get by selling the item.
I have this problem also, I just don't want to sell stuff that might be a
quest item.  Just browse through Allakhazam's guests for your class and
other quests you might like to do for financial gain.  Commit it to memory
and you should have a much easier time destroying items.
If you can't bring yourself to destroy stuff make a mule(I know cheeting)
and dump stuff on it to make room to keep the nodrop stuff.
