We have MGB Aego'ers and MGB POTG'ers. The routine is roughly
as follows:

MGB Aego incoming.

YAAAAAGH!

NO!

Let me get out of the way!

<Spam a billion people getting Aego>

GODDAMIT

I was AFK! Where'd my POTG go?

(etc)

Ok, those who want POTG click off Aego, MGB POTG coming

Wheee!

WHOOP!

Thanks hon ;)

HRURAH!

I havent seen many people who have a self only mana regen buff
that *doesnt* stack with POTG yet... certainly the lich line
does, although I dont know about armour of the risen (is that
the cleric one?)

Our casters tend to prefer KEI+POTG to KEI+Aego

*shrug*

As a melee, even when main tanking, if its in an XP group and
I'm not short of buff slots I'll take POTG + bulwark + symbol
in preference to Aego. On a raid of course when I'mj trying to
squeeze as many buffs in as possible Aego > All ;)
