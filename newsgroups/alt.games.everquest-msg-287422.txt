well, i see what you're saying ... i've found it half and and half
with it being fine to seem normal and with it being far too short to
make any sense...probably varies by zone or npc type or whatever

maybe eq has more quests than wow ... what with it letting you ever-
quest

(*cringe*)

i've previously admitted that it's lame how the groups of npcs in big
zones are set up like dominos ... the lvl 21-23s here, the 24-26
there, etc

that's not all zones, it seems so far only like huge zones (like the
commonlands or butcherblock mountains)

well ... ok

but if you wanted to farm at a low level (like spiderling silks in eq1
when you're lvl 7), it doesn't matter what you're playing

well me neither, but i would make a poor standard

but i know the augmentations common at the high end would require
alchemy, poison making, jewelcraft, and maybe smithing

i don't know what high-end means in eq1 anymore, but that was what i
was thinking when i said you could find player-made gear

the drop rate was pretty horid ... but before knowing things like
population tables, secret placeholders, and all those spawn times/
locations ... it was still insane to find QM

beastlord!

well, i wouldn't assume gear dependence is a good thing

but in general, anytime less "work" is required to win, so long as the
"work" is fun, that's craptastic

it's annoying to have the game play itself, but eq1 does this all the
more, and when the holdup is waiting around LFG for an hour, that's
not the kind of playing i want to pay for

the gear is somewhat communist...it's interchangable and boring
(except at the high endd) ... but i actually prefer that, i like the
non-twinking ... even the fact that almost everything wearable/usable
is attunable

the most exciting game in years, for me, is the game of trying to find
a way to emulate classic EQ on a private server and running my own
scripts, writing them and being the GM who executes them and having
like 10 friends log in and play, kind of like d&d, or what i hear NWN
was

it's actually quite nice when it looks very very very pretty
