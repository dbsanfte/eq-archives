If the reason that people are having to redo parts of the quest wasn't
due to fuckups on SOEs part, you might have a point. Unfortunately,
the shaman epic has had a couple of bugs introduced in the last few
months where you get your positive faction hits then can't complete
that part for your next drop. At least the GMs on Bristlebane are
willing to give the turnin pieces back.
