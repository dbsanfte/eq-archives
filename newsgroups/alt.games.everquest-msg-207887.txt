Basic rule of thumb: If you havent asked for it dont open it.
some anti-virus programs can scan unopened attachments not sure which ones
but there should be info on the web.
try looking at the headers for the e-mail and see if there is a abuse
address then report the mofo which may or may not produce results,
personally I tend to delete anything like that and put them on blocked
sender list.
