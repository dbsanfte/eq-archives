Group DS is great in mad-cap free-for-all LDoN (normal) where 
almost everyone is getting hit.

Get to 64 and get Planar renewal - then you can alternate bolt/heal
with much better healing efficiency (4:1 base vs ~2:1 for 52 and 60).

Basically the same as /pet attack - the pet still switches.  The
only way to re-aquire the old target is:

/pet back off
/pet kill

As long as the pet doesn't get hit by the mob you don't want to
have him on between back off and kill he will switch back.

Rathe's Son is a 65 spell, and the last I saw on Lanys (granted 2 mo.
ago) was 50k.  That was *before* the improvements to it, when most mages
still thought it was a POS.  Now it's the best tanke we have, so I
can't imagine it's gone down in price.

The least taunted one still has a tendency to come off.  From painful
experience.  I think he just doesn't have the tools yet for this pair,
get planar renewal and it becomes doable with bolt/heal alternation.

Also, rains don't get focused by a DD bracer, and they are Evoc (is
Splendid Conj spec?  most post 60 mages are.)
