>>>some dink waiting cats a spell an POOF! one shot one kill and no mor
eloot for me.<<<


You must have been one of those whiners complaining about KSing every 20
seconds. SSSSoooooooooooooo.............


one last time:

The zones were set so you could not see any PC engaging a mob until you were
in melee distance of that mob. (apparently this was done to keep the zone
from crashing with a million people in it).

So it is entirely possible that the *dink* caster did not see you, did not
know you were there, and KSed you UNINTENTIONALLY. It happened alot. Even
with my warrior, I would see a mob just standing there, run up to hit it,
and notice and the last moment that someone was on it.

To repeat: You had to be within *melee* distance of a mob to see anyone on
that mob. Even standing a few steps away, you only saw the mob.
