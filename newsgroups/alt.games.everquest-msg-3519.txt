I would have LOVED to buy one for only 200-300pp

//begin rant
I only own 1 and on Ayonea Ro I made a hot key
WTB Stein of Moggok 350pp
Did that for 3 HOURS and not a single taker so I made a new hot key
WTB Stein of Moggok 450pp!
Did that for another hour and then added another 100pp
Finally after 6 hours and raising the price to 1000pp I got one.
If anyone reads this, I have 4 more casters and all still need Steins!  I
have now run totally out of plat, and I can't seem to find ANYONE willing to
part with theirs or go do the quest and sell me one.  This confuses me
because I see every single newbie caster has one and most (not all) tell me
theirs was GIVEN to them.  Anyways if you're on Ayonae Ro and you can get
the Steins here is my suggestion SELL THEM! Please SELL THEM! I am having a
near impossible time getting them and don't really have the time to sit
there for 6 or 7 hours trying to buy one.
