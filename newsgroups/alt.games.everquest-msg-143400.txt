You are vastly overestimating the ability of quad kiting. It is a common
mistake. The best druid quad spell is fist of karana . 812 dammage for 357
mana hits a maximum of four targets.Gather four targets (30 secs), nuke them
down (90 secs, takes 7 casts for a 5khp mob) med up 2500 mana (with kei and
ft 10 takes 2500/48 =52 ticks or 5 and half minutes ) total time 7 and half
minutes total dammage done 20k.

A warrior with equivalent equipment without haste just item haste has a dps
of 70 or so. 7and half mins x70dps=31k. Not only are you close you are
better. If you spend a third of your time bandaging you are exactly
equivalent. If you bot a shaman it just gets obscene.

Warriors are so spoiled by the excellent experience they can easily get in
groups that they look down from a lofty height indeed on the soloers. What
you consider very crappy experience soloing is the very good experience the
druid was bragging about in the first place.
