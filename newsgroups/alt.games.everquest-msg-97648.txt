Out of the mass of "consider us" college brochures I received
(Harvard among them), there was one that really stood out from
the pack -- Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. I wish I still 
had it. The rest were pretty much all the same old tripe.

I didn't follow up on it, though, as that was way too far 
from home for this seventeen year old (in 1985) introvert.

[drifting the topic further, sorry about that]
