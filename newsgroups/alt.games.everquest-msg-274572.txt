By demonstrating your honesty.

>  I can only tell you that I am honest.

Rings hollow when you're doing it in a thread where you've *explicitly*
stated that you're dishonest.

>  To prove it?  How?  Its your word against mine.

No, it's your word against your actions.  Your word is "I'm honest".  Your
actions are "I gave my word not to sell, now I'm selling".

In court they'd ask "Did you agree to this contract?" and then they'd ask
"Are you now reneging on the contract?".  Again, it wouldn't be one person's
word against another; it'd be your word against your actions.

> How does one honestly transfer an account?

One doesn't.  The EULA which you agreed to *every single time* you logged on
states that you cannot sell the account.  Accounts can only be transferred
under very explicit, limited conditions, such as parents transferring an
account to a child.  Only liars sell accounts.

> You people are too skeptical for your own good.

No.  What you're complaining about is that most of us are too honest for our
own good.  And some of us are even moreso.
