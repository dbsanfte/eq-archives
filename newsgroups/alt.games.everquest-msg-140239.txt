Again and again and again. *sigh*. Who exactly are these "pick up
groups" that you are referring to? And these groups that clear the maze
with 3 people again? 

Allow me to jump in with a guess before you answer, please. I'll guess
that they are groups composed of level sixties in (at a minimum) full
NToV gear with some AA skills, yes?

I only say that because our first forrays into the maze in CT recently
were with two FULL groups and we were slaughtered like cattle. Of
course, I'm talking about two groups with an average level of around 55
with only two level sixties in the bunch, and the best gear they have
between them is either player crafted melee armor, or (more commonly)
stuff from Kael (the arena and quest drops, not AoW/STatue/Tormax level
stuff) or Hate.

Those items are fucking FAR from being as trivial to obtain for most
people as you try to indicate. If they were that easy, the only jungle
spider fur cap for sale in the bazaar on Xev wouldn't be going for
55KPP.

And again we see the exact same level of perspective (or lack thereof)
that spurred the original confusion in this thread, IMO. Fmrom your
viewpoint, a mob has to be the level of fucking Cazic to even qualify as
"tough".

For the majority of the guilds, Cazic is unkillable. Might be different
on a far older server. Maybe there just aren't any lower level guilds on
your server and every player there is in a race for AoW every time the
statue's available. We have, last I checked, *maybe* five or six guilds
that can take Cazic, and two of them would have to work together.

And except for some idiots starting trains at the entry, CT (the zone,
not the god) is pretty much an exclusive hunting ground for those five
or six guilds, with most of the rest simply not having the guns to do
much more in there than hang on for their lives.

Let's not lose sight of what started this debate, Martin. Nobody (at
least not me) *ever* said it was impossible to break that cap. The point
is, it's going to be damned few people who do it, and making it sound
like it's "not very hard" to do so is an unrealistic view.
