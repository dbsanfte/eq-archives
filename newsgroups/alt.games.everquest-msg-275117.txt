EQ1 have massively different combat engines for dual wield,1h, etc.


Parses are the only way to validate his hypothesis, which already
falls at the first hurdle ... 'weapons that do X DPS'. There is no
such constant figure for comparison, and dual wield/2h'er/1h'er
scale differently depending on critter.

Hippies comment is good advice if you actually want to make an
informed decision about weapons in EQ1. The flavour of the post
makes me think it was just an unlabelled EQ2 question though.
