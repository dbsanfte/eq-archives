> Alacrity.  Upgrade to Quickness.  115 mana (Q is 80) for "5 minutes 48
Alacrity eats you alive. Augmentation is your mana saving haste. About as
good as quickness, with longer duration, and some agility.  For soloing
however, it is the spell to use simply because your pet sucks so much, and
even a few % is worth it. Heaven help you at 29 when you get in a group with
5 hybrids, that all want Alacrity and Clarity... You will never have any
mana. Well you might. I didn't have any focus items because they didn't
exist at the time.
> Beguile.  Charm upgrade.  I have yet to charm as a chanter, lack of run
Charming is an art form. One that I am far from a master of. I have followed
a guy into the hole, all the way to the enchanter epic mob, with me and a
cleric just hanging back, me nuking from time to time for lack of things to
do, and a slightly higher level (57 I think) enchanter charming through. The
cleric healed him twice. We had no sow.
The major point of Beguile is it has a higher level cap.
> Chaos Flux.  Another in the line of Nukes, my evocation skill sucks, and
I basically stopped nuking around 20 and started again around 45. I'd cast
just enough to be reminded how much I suck at nuking. At 29 if I had soloed
I would have nuked more, but at 29 you got clarity and suddenly everyone
wants you in their group.
> Illusion Skeleton.  Hopefully this works like Invis to Undead, making me
Useless. Had a few uses, then they changed the way illusions work, and now
it's just a special effect.
> Tepid Deeds.  Research only, couldn't buy it or find any of the pages,
Tepid deeds is most useful later in the game. When you are absolutly pinched
for mana you use tepid deeds instead of a higher slow. I think I stuck with
the old one till I got Clarity.
However for soloing your pet is so weak, every bit is needed.
> Enchant Gold.  I don't currently have any of the enchant metal spells, I
Don't bother then. They sell for very little profit really.
> Illusion Earth Elemental.  Includes a 10 str buff.   Ooooh, 10 str.  For
Nope. Only thing it's useful for 10 str when you are overloaded with junk to
sell. It USED to make you better factioned in some zones (with that and
invis you could wander the hole with impunity if you had not fought there),
but they changed the way illusions work. Now monster illusions treat you as
your stock race.
The primary use for it used to be getting your vial of XXX mana spells from
the brownies but now the masters of illusion have to pay a !@#%!## Druid to
do it for us (wolf form is indiff, illusions are not).
> Rune II.   Damage sponge spell.  Uses a component, max damage absorbed
I used Runes very little. I mainly carry the gems because clerics use
similar components at similar levels and occasionally I get some a-hole that
won't 'waste' symbol on me unless I give him the gems.
Also, you are xping in Luclin, where even the lower level mobs hit somewhat
harder than old world, when the rune line was made. Not much mind you.
> Sagar's Animation.  Sadly, despite someone stating otherwise in another
Sorry, my bad, I got the info off of a static site, It's been so long I
couldn't remember myself. 29 then. the last major pet upgrade.
> Strip Enchantement.  There's little use for Cancel Magic line, is there
When you are fighting buffing mobs, strip is nice. It's situational, of
course. It's also a key lineup spell for PvP.
My pulling spell of choice is either Tash or Slow, depending on relative
resists and group makeup. Slow by itself actually seems to generate less
agro that tash by itself.
