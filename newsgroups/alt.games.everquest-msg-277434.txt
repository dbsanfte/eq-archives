It was like this when you played, with the exception of the soloable giant.  
In fact, the group encounters that I soloed were actually easier.  The 
access quests have not changed, but, as it was when you played, you do not 
have to do the access quests for Zek, EL, and a few others, you just have 
to level to the minimum level required, then you automatically gain access.

Quoting really helps btw...
