For someone I don't now I'd expect them to cover the cost of the coffin
but generally wouldn't want any payment from a lower level character in
an easy to get to zone for summoning their corpse. For a level 65
character in somewhere which will take me some time to get to I'd like a
contribution of maybe up to 100pp depending on how long it takes me to
get to them, but I'd never expect it.

If you get a level 65 necro to help you there is a good chance they'll
be able to summon your corpse without using a coffin anway.
