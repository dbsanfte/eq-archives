Yes, but that is besides the point. :)

Running from Qeynos to NK, teleporting to the Nexus, teleporting back
down to Odus takes twice as long as the boat ride would have.

I wouldn't mind taking the extra time if I had more time to play.

This is MY reason but the bottom line is...

The boats should work. 

Or.. they should make a new class, Son of God, who can walk on water and
forage wine and fish. :)

Or maybe this is one of those "It doesn't affect me so quityerbitchin"
type situations. But I wonder what the reaction would be if the spires
were working one week and broken for the next two. I bet the reaction
would be different then.
