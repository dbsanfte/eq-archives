Alright, as some of you know I play a beastlord on karana. well ever since
the patch and hearing some of the horror stories assosiated with the patch,
ive been afraid to log onto it.


SO. I made a bard, and to ENSURE I have *no* temptation of logging on my
druid or beast to pl this bard (and risk getting owned by bugs), I put the
bard on brell.


So, here begins the rants.

Every newbie zone on brell lags, I dont mean normal lag spikes, I mean the
same mob walks past you 10 times (seriously)
When I inquired about this I was told it only started happening after the
patch.

Also with the lag, when I try to loot a corpse, it takes several seconds to
bend down, several seconds [per piece] to loot, and several seconds to stand
up.

So, ok, I can deal with the lag. bards after all have an AE song. ill just
run in circles and eventually half of halas will die.. except, I died
something like 17 times before I adapted, ok.. ill live..

So, I went to innothule swamp yesterday from levels 3 to 5, farmed
spiderling silks and zombie skins and such, the lag was bearable. altho now
everything is green and runs at 40%, which makes it difficult when there is
some lag. so I moved on.

from 5 to 9 I grouped in crushbone and killed orcs today. surprisingly the
lag wasnt horrible here either, seems to only *majorly* effect city zones.

once I hit 9 I decided it was time to farm pelts and stuff, the goal now is
to try to make a few kpp and buy some gear, so I head the EC, IMO the *best*
zone for the level to get pelts, minimal threats, guards nearby in all
directions, etc.  WRONG. not safe. at night like 200 skeletons pop. (I was
actually aware of this, I knew this was where sony decided to stick their
massive army of death for the celebration) and had intended to leave once it
commenced. nope.. not happening. some of those guys harm touch or something
for near 200 points. which effectively ends the life of a level 9 untwinked
bard.
So I figured i'd try WC (and instead of being smart and getting a port, or
going through the RV stone and taking that route.. I tried to run through
EC.. about 8 times)

Turns out these skeletons have a *big* agro range, apparently can outrun
selo's, and are largely ignored (at least not as camped as the first few
days)
they love to cast fear, and really enjoy casting dots. which brings me to
the next problem.

It turns out if you die from a dot theres a chance when you repop in your
bind spot.. you will just die again, and again, and again... untill you exit
the game and come back, at which time you will be low on health and *still*
have the damn dot on you. even tho you died. like 30 times.


Dont misunderstand me, im not whining, crying, bitching, moaning, etc. I do
not intend to quit playing and delete the game, nor cancel my accounts.
I just wanted to share my experiences as a "newbie"

But seriously. what was sony thinking putting 200 *highly agressive*, KOS,
harm touching, dotting, FAST RUNNING, with a big agro range, skeletons in a
newbie zone that otherwise wouldnt have had anything much higher than level
15.
