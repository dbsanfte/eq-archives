For me this is the problem.

Well the fact that mobs are all mixed up, level 20 mobs through to level
30 mobs all walking around together, and all agroing and adding.

Few safe pull spots.

I have actually made a few levels there with my Druid, but the fact that
there are not clear areas of mobs or safe places to pull to make it a
pain once the kobold camps green out.

If they had mad it so that there were sperate bits of wood, each with a
different level range of mobs in, and "spaces" between where you could
pull, then the zone would be teaming with PCs.

Maybe,

Jim
