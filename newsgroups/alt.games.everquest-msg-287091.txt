Yep, not every expansion should cater to every level.  I did forget to
mention TSS.  I am so busy trying to catch up in the earlier
expansions, I haven't done much in TSS.  But I will say this, In two
zones, you go from newbie critters to ones that can clean the clock of
most high levels.  For example, the gnolls in Steppes, just near the
druid ring.  Wandered to close accidently, and was dead in seconds, to
a LT Blue.

Also, although they advertised an "alternate progression" I don't
think its anywhere as good as the old world progressions.  Just take a
look at the level spreads from zone to zone...actually Alla has a nice
layout if you select zones by level.  Scroll down to the bottom ones
(last ones).  See that slope dramatically to the 70+ area?  That means
you get one zone to level up in if you chose the "alternate".  In 2
zones you go from 1 to 70.

But let me flame myself a bit here.  You know, I whined a bit, then
realized, the zones I loved and played in for years are STILL THERE.
If I choose to I can hang out in Butcherblock, schwacking beetles and
goblins.  Or Everfrost (one of my favorites).  If I choose to I can
decline the urge to buy a soulstone and just do a dern CR for the fun
of it.  Oh yes, I am spoiled I suppose.  And with all the
improvements, I forgot that the old stuff is still right there.
