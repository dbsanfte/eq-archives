Not even close to true, because, from what I've seen, monk damage
ridiculously higher than a rangers.  And damage isn't just what a tank
is suppose to do anyway.  A tanks job is to take damage and keep aggro
so the casters in the group don't get smeared.  Damage dealers (rogues
and monks) job is to NOT get hit, and just dish out damage.  Rangers
aren't bad damage dealers, and aren't good tanks, but we can do a
little of everything.
