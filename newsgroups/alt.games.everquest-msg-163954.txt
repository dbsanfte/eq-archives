I don't *have* to believe, I've run the numbers.  If you aren't in an
uberguild then your monk *is* behind all those classes.  The sustained
dps of my Wizard in Plane of Valor is in *excess* of 120dps during
combat.  My monk does about 70dps.  In the Trials in Justice, for the 10
minute duration my Wizard was over 200dps.  My monk did 70dps.  The only
time my Monk can every outdamage my Wizard is an indoor zone with 90%+
uptime and 90%+ uptime pretty much disappeared with the new experience
model and PoP zone implementaion.
