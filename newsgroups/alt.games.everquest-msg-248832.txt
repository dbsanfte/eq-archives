The real pisser is that they laid new copper in my neighborhood 3 years ago and
ran fiber to within 1/2 mile of my house. Then they never got around to turning
on DSL because a neighboring state (Oklahoma) passed some laws that made it more
lucrative for SBC to focus building infrastructure in that state.

I've been trying to find some way to call someone at SBC about this. Know what?
You can't call the phone company. They don't have a published number for the
local business office.
