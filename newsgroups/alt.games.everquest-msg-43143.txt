Only if another player or an NPC is close, then it mysteriously
vanishes.

Seriously, I have never lost anything I dropped for another character to
pick up, but now that I am transferring things worth over 100pp I make
sure I have a trusted friend do the transfer for me.

P.S.: one thing that will vanish when you log is the fish in Qeynos for
the Stein of Moggok quest. Do not make a new character, kill it (to
avoid the faction hit to your main) and expect it to be there for yur
main or whatever other char to loot, it vanishes when you log. What I
did was find someone else who wants a stein too, and I made a newb
thief, got a nice rusty longsword and a lot of buffs, and toasted it for
him to loot, then he did the opposite for me.

Cheers :)
