Just to follow up on what Dan said, this is from Caster's Realm which is
from EQ's Devel Corner.  In the meantime, MPC is only on 'Test'.

Q: When are you going to turn [project M] back on? It was on the evening of the
patch (several hours after the servers came back up) but has not been available
since.

A: Right now, we don't know. Not only was it causing a bit of crowding on the Zeks
(primetime after a patch, nonetheless), but we think we want to fiddle with it a bit
more. There were some problems with the implementation, not major but bothersome,
that we'd also like to work with a little. Right now it's up in the air.
