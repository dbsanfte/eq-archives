Well, given that the movie generally costs more in a theater than it does
to rent it on video, in some ways, you do pay for the previews.  I
generally consider previews to be extra-good added value, though, since it
allows me to be 5 minutes late without missing the actual movie.  As long
as it's not one of those stupid new previews advertising the soundtrack
album that include some of the better scenes from the movie I'm about to
watch that give away the plot.  I hate that.  The plot already sucks
enough in most recent Hollywood movies without having it given away.
