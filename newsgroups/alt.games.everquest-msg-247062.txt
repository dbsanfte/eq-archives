My two cents:

It was never the monthly cost that turned me off, it was the cost of the
expansions.  I would most likely have continued to subscribe if the
monthly cost was a few extra dollars per month, but the expansions were
"free" (even though, in the end, it would have ended up costing the
same!).

A weird psychological thing, I guess...
