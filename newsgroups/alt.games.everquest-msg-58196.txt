I am a newbie to the game started a dark elf Shadow Knight worked myself up
to 19th level off hunting crocs, and had someone give me a nice weapon (well
I think its nice) The Sporaldi defender Blade

But I am growing tired of Caimans, Crocs and there Deep Water Versions, and
of course those Orcs too,

Just wondering what to starting fighting on to help increase my lvl and see
something new to the game.
