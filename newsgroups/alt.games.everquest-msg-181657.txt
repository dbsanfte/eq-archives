Welcome to the world of uberguilds, jaZZ.

On every server where RZtW has been killed, the first guild to kill him has
cockblocked the rest.

This is nothing new... when Luclin was the latest expansion, guilds tried
their best to cockblock rival guilds on Emp/VT.

On prexus, 1 sole guild controlled Emp for the entire expansion, until the
day PoP was released.

Almost every single emp that popped they killed, infact there were precisely
*2* Emp pops, in the entire of Luclin to PoP release, that guild1 didn't win
the race to.

Their beloved VT was safe though, the first time it happened Emp was
accidently turgable, and so GM's /killed it on rival_guild.  The second time
rival_guild won the race, Ssra mysteriously crashed, and Emp was no longer
up.

With RZtW, guild1 has the luxury of knowing the encounter, they know they
will likely win... guild2,3 and 4 gets 1 shot (if they are lucky) and if
they wipe (likely).. guild1 steps over their corpses.

I read some of the dispute on James' server... page 2 has a harsh flame from
the Prexus guild who are grieved "their" RZtW has been killed by others...

As to why.. greed.. rivalry?
I don't want to be part of 200 people zergs.. I wouldn't brag if I got into
a zone via that method.. but I sure as hell wouldn't call them exploiters or
cry that they were taking my stuff.
