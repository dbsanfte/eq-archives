Precisely. Its the *US constitution* which provides the barriers to
the tyranny of the majority, not the democratic process. My point
exactly.

Now that you've got the Senate consider marginalized first nations,
gays, aids victims, Middle Eastern descended Americans post 9-11,
blacks, etc... the Senate is a "good thing" but it only helps fix one
representational failure  not all of them, not even "most of them"...
just one of them, and even with that its controversial whether its
actually working... considering that, say Washington State has quite a
few legitimate grievances that they're passed over for government
attention *disproportionately* often.

Pointing at the Senate and saying its the "solution to majority
tyranny" is probably what an 8th grader would be taught to say. But
its not remotely a complete solution. Its a band-aid, at best, aimed
at a specific failure.
