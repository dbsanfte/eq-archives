But it isn't. Even SOE doesn't say its illegal, they can't. Its never
been decided that a player's virtual property in a video game is
"copyrighted" and not transferrable. In fact, they'd be hard pressed
to show why a person can't sell such items for real money but can in
fact transfer them to other players in game. Its a question of a legal
difference. 

This is new territory, so you can't just flatly say its wrong. You
might not like it, you might consider it immoral, but its not illegal
in any way. If it was illegal, SOE would not have to do anything since
the law would be after them.
