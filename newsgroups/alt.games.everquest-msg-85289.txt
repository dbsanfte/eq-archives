There was already one instance where this can happen. Waking the
Sleeper. VI have specifically stated that the ramifications of waking
the sleeper were fully thought through and put in for precisely that
reason. To have an event which can only happen ONCE and leave a lasting
change on the game. 

In doing so, the people who did get there first and awoke the Sleeper
just as VI intended, were blasted for 'ruining the game' for others who
wouldn't get the chance to do the same themselves. As soon as the
direction of the game is changed by a PC's actions, all the
'entitlement' freaks jump up and down screaming about how their L20
soloing main will never get the chance to experience it.
