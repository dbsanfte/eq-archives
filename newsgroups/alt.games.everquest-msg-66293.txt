Latest ATI drivers installed.
Latest DirectX 8.1 installed.
2 sperate ATI cards in 2 seperate machines.
ATI Rage 128 in Win98 machine.
ATI Mobility M4 in W2K machine.
Both have Gamma slider problem.
Both have blinking problem in trade windows.
Both machines have SoL installed.
Both machines have 512MB+ RAM.

W2K machine has a fonts issue.

Bottom line, the user community has helped themselves more that Verant has
when it comes to the ATI cards.
But currently, we can only upgrade to the latest drivers from ATI and MS.
It's in Verant's hands now to fix the game for ATI cards.
Check the tech sup boards and you will see what I am talking about.
