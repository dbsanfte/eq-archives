You're doing it wrong. No offense, but I've seen a lot of folks try to
get groups in other themes and fail, but I don't.

Why? Because I don't try to get a group, I make one.

The problem with trying to get a group is that unless you're a CLR or
ENC, someone has an opinion about how your class sucks and they should
be getting someone else. When you start the group you can hand-pick
the classes you work best with. This leads to expirimentation and new
discoveries, and also gets you a group by default.

Some ideas for making it easier:

1. Try to get tanks, clerics and pet classes for NRO. The "hook" for
NRO is that pet classes get an awesome pet focus at a fairly low AP
level. Plate classes get a great set of armor, starting with a 63AC BP
with 3 augmentation slots. Other themes are good too, but NRO is a
good place to build a "following" of people who will group with you in
the other themes.

2. Don't just turn on LFP and expect tells, keep banging on the
refresh for "players looking for a group" and send tells to anyone
that doesn't have "No LDON" in their LFG text.

3. Be understanding and as helpful as possible on adventures you
organize. Listen to others, even when you "know" they are wrong, and
when it's over add them to your friends list and ask them to look you
up next time THEY have a group.

4. Get maps. This is key. Folks who don't do this will really remember
"that guy who knew where to go". Each dungeon has 1-3 possible
assassination/rescue locations in big rooms, if you learn to choose
wisely, you will get good results. In other adventure types, it's key
to avoid going down too many dead-ends to maximize fight vs run time.

5. If you win, ask everyone if they want to go again. This really
cements the impression that your groups rock.

6. Pay close attention to average level. The break-points are 22.5,
27.5, 32.5, etc. If you have a group that averages 62.75, you're
probably going to be under-powered, so while it might seem bad to
invite the lower-level character, sometimes it's exactly the right
thing to do! If you have a group that averages exactly on the cusp,
you round down and you will have plenty of firepower. Again, success
gets you future groups.

7. Pay attention to the responses you get when you ask people to come.
If they start hammering you for lots of detail and telling you what
kind of adventure they will and won't do, think twice about bringing
them along. People who do this all the time don't pester. They might
ask what kind of group you have or what the level range is, but rarely
will they start barking terms under which they will group. You need
people who are willing to be part of a team, not a bunch of lone
wolves.

I still go /lfg from time to time, but usually I don't have to. Folks
know that I put together good groups, and I know the others who do
too. All of my worst experiences are from turning on /lfg and getting
a random group.

As far as winning groups go, here are some tips:

Dont' be afraid to go tankless if you have at least 2 good pet classes
(NEC, MAG or BST). I've done many tankless adventures, and won every
one.

Healers are key. If you have a shammy or drood for healer, get a
secondary healer just in case.

Crowd control of some form is needed. I don't know where bards
cap-out, but keep in mind that neco mez doesn't work in level 65
adventures, and only half the time in level 60. Chanters are really
the way to go, even more so than clerics.

Have at least 2 heavy hitters. Few people actually parse log data
themselves, and those that do don't always know how to read the
results. I can tell you that  the classes that WILL pull their own in
terms of dps are MNK, ROG, WIZ. The classes that CAN pull their own if
they know how to play their classes are MAG, NEC, RNG, DRU, BST, SHD,
BRD.

Also keep class combinations in mind. If you get a bard, have 2 other
melee, since bards do their best work when there are other melee to
enhance with DS, haste, etc. Their mana regen and other caster
benefits are not AS powerful. Another example is Mage: if you get one,
you should get at least one other pet class too, so that the mage's
summoned items give you free dps without having to spend mana through
the adventure. Same goes for BA and ID items that the mage can summon:
they add dps if you get the right classes.

If you're tweeking level ranges, go for higher level MT and lower
level healer(s). Unlike many other parts of EQ, you will find that
LDON wants this configuration badly.

If you have classes like SHM and NEC that can dot well, pay attention
to dps. SHM may be better off spending mana on extra buffs and NEC may
be better off nuking if your kill-rate is sufficiently low. It takes a
while and some serious number-crunching to be really specific, but my
feeling is that fights under 45 seconds don't want dots at all in
LDON. The dps on dots can be staggering, but if they're not
mana-efficient, they are not useful.
