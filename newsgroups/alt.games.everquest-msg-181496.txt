Couple things:
1) Using "killing arrows" is really going to skew the results of this
experiment.  I'd say use whatever arrows you normally use.  If I were going
to be running the experiment, I'd use arrows from a tolan's bracer or
another cheap arrow which I'm more likely to be plinking away at a mob with
until I get EQ.
2) Get yourself a better bow ;)  Check out the ratios on nightmarewood
(should just be getting better than steelshaft around your level) and
blessed faydark thunderbolt (definitely better, but a little more expensive,
and nightmarewood will eventually be better around lvl 60 or so).  Unless
you're poor from making the aforementioned arrows, there shouldn't be a
reason that you don't have one of those.

Should be interesting to hear the results ;)
