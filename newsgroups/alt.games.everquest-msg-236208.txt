Fair enough.  And to be sure, he *was* practicing FD during
med breaks, so he was trying to raise them.  But on the other
hand, it's not as though you have to "do nothing but mend and
fd" to max them out.  I keep FD maxed by having a hotkey that
does feign + stand, and using it liberally whenever I'm running
anywhere.  (It means I have to keep the arrow key down instead
of using autorun, but that's not a big deal, and it's only until
the skill is maxed again.)  Mend takes longer since it takes six
minutes to reset, so I guess I can understand it being low if
someone is pushing a new monk.

But then, the subject of this thread is PL'ed toons, and this
*is* one of the problems with PL'ing -- it's hard to keep some
essential skills at the levels they deserve.  And, to play
devil's advocate a bit, those are two of the "defining skills"
of the monk class, so it really can cause problems if someone
leaves them too low, because other players in the group may
base their tactics on the assumption that the monk has trained
the skills to a reasonable level, just like you wouldn't expect
a level 23 warrior to have an offense skill of 15.

But you're probably right: in the mid-20's most players probably
don't automatically assume that everyone's skills are maxed, in
part *because* a lot of toons at those levels are still in the
middle of being ramped up and haven't had the time.  My viewpoint
is perhaps skewed because my mid-20's monk is my main, so I
haven't been in a rush to push him up levels because every level
is new to me and I want to take my time, explore, and learn.
That happens to give me the time to max out even the awkward
skills like Mend, but I can see where someone who's already
played several toons to the 30+ range might be more interested
in getting to the mid- and high-levels to see what makes a monk
different from other classes, and they wouldn't take the time to
max out their skills at every level along the way.

Of course, I don't know whether that's where this guy was coming
from, or whether he just couldn't be bothered, but I'm willing
to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Thanks for the perspective!
