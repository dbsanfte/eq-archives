3, apparently.

I went on a further 3 adventures today, all of which gave the L35 dungeon
AFAIK (highest level player was the Paladin, now L40, with others being a
L35 Ranger, me (now L37 BST), Druid (L39), another BST (L35) and a
Shadowknight (L37).

All of the adventures were a success, and each time I received 3 points,
with the Druid and Paladin getting 4. The only odd thing was on one of the
adventures the Druid claimed to have received 12 points - which made the
rest of us somewhat jealous :)

The mobs were all DB to me at 37, including the boss mob in one of the
missions. Regular mobs appeared to have 1000 to 1150 or so HPs, the boss was
harder to discern (due to all the battle spam) but I'd estimate somewhere
between 2000 and 2500. The boss mob also hit harder, doubling for 113.

Now I've almost finished with the L35 dungeons, the next step is to try get
more info about the L40 dungeon over the next couple of days. The exp is
such that it's hard not to level by the time you've completed 3 quests! :)
