Tboots = L9 SoW speed
JBoots = L9 SoW speed

Horses come in three DIFFERENT speeds.

An 'alternative' of a greater price than j/tboots for the slowest horse,
to me, denotes slightly faster than L9 SoW speed. The fact that the
other 2 horses are faster, denotes faster than L9 SoW by XXX amount
which should be noticeable enough to justify the increased cost.

I didn't ignore it, I included as much information that is known. You
could just as well say Sporalai Gloves are an alternative to Gauntlets
of Dragonslaying for haste
