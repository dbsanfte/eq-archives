Sorry - but I've done this by mistake so many times it's not funny. We see
the spell effects you're throwing around and when it comes time to refresh
the buffs on all the casters I'm just targeting and casting. (I only make
the mistake once per session tho ;-)

On the flip side, when I do inadvertantly cast it, when everyone is done
chuckling I make good by tossing a few CHA buffs on the bard. Makes them
happy ;-)
