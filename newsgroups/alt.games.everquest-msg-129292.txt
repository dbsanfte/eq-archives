Better than Sinfest by about a thousand centuries.

"I think there is a chance that the spread of Japanese animation 
overseas might only lead to embarrassment."
- Hayao Miyazaki (obviously racist against anime! O_O!!!)

"I could see from the man's eyes that he was rejecting my advice. How 
could I possibly be right when $54 million said I was wrong? How 
could human taste be a better barometer of movie quality than the success 
of a marketing campaign?"
- Roger Ebert

"The Cables have this manic quality that's not easy to perfect."
- John "Stupid" Ford (Josh fucking Cable could troll better than him)
