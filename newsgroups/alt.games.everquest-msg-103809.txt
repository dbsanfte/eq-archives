Ask an Enchanter for a Mana regen buff, I always give if asked politely
without d00d spk! I even have quad crazy druids/wizards port them selves
from their hunting ground for c2 etc and then gate back. I happy to help on
Xegony.

As for items, Thurgadin Shawl quest is long and laborious for a whole FT1 on
your shoulders. Group in Cazic Thule and hope you win roll on the FTIII
boots or buy them for 70 - 100kpp

I believe shaman can make potions that effectively give something similar to
Breeze (or is it Clarity?)
