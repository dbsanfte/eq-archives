At what level?  Cause at level 11, I'm still stopping to mine tradeskill nodes
with 4 mobs beating on me, cause the risk of death is still much less than the
reward of possibly getting 1-3 skill increases ;p

So far death in EQ2 has seemed almost a joke.  But then, death in EQ1 was a
joke 99 percent of the time as well.   If you consider rezes, there was almost
no real exp loss on death there.   Even a recovered corpse in EQ2 still leaves
you with a noticable debt. .
