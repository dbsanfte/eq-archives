If you read the quoted segment, though, you'll see he is refering to the
"14 or above" level of a friendly mage... when mages can summon
magic weapons from first level on.  Not great weapons, of course,
but all you wanted to do was turn your skellie that couldn't hit
magic into one that can.

The wisps also drop Lightstones, which sell to players for around
a pp each; you could do the quest with them as well, but the
book you get is only worth a few silvers... the reason people will
buy them is that it is good experience.  They drop far more often
than GLS.

They also drop Burned Out Lightstones, which have very little
use, are common as dirt, and no drop... while you might want
to have some when you start doing research if you go the
practice route... you'll be able to get all you need with incredible
simplicity at that level, don't bother saving these. They drop
far more often than the Lightstones, so you are in for a lot
of killing if you want to get rich on the GLS quest.
