Not sure on a Piercing light source weapon but there are many Items that
give infervision or even ultravision. My vision impaired monk uses a Glowing
Stone Band (infervision) from Sol A. In Dungeons I lose a little AC and a
few hit points but being able to see more then makes up for it. If Soloing I
just switch back and forth at night. I have also used the Eye Patch of
Shadows (UltraVision) but I don't remember where it came from as I was a
loan from a group member and being a dumbass I didn't write it down or look
it up again. Anyway I would look for one of these type items you will be
much happier.
