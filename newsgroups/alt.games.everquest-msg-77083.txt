Nagafen isn't very representative of end game encounters.  He doubles
for 255, and his AoE can be resisted with about 250+ FR.  Making it
relatively weak damage output.

Try a mob like Vindicator.  Quad 600 will disabuse you of any notion
that a druid casting a 885hps Nature's Touch is a "healer".  You might
touch up riposte damage, but don't expect to keep anyone alive by
yourself.

Hell, if you want to see some serious damage output, try Yelinak or
Sontalak or AoW.  Now *THAT* is damage output.

It's better to not count on it.
Remember, if something can fuck up, it generally will and usually at
the worst possible time.
