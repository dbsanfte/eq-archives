	Ah, but this goes back to one of my big beefs.

	You and I know the difference between a "program" and "data".
For example:

	JPG files are datafiles with a certain specific format
(specifically, the JPG format).  JPG files are not executable files
because JPG files are not programs.  They're just piles of data.

	LView is a program (i.e. an executable file) that can read,
among other things, datafiles in the JPG format.

	To you and I, the distinction is clear:  You need a program to
interpret data.  A datafile is useless without an executable program
file which can interpret it.  All the JPG files in the world won't do
you any good unless you've got a program that can interpret data
formatted in the JPG format.

	It used to be the case that you could not successfully operate
a computer unless you understood this fundamental distinction between
"programs" and "data."

	Apple and Microsoft correctly identified this situation as an
entry barrier which prevented potential customers from buying
computers.  They realized that if they wanted to increase sales, they
would have to find some way of minimizing or eliminating this
distinction in the minds of potential customers.  After all, you don't
need to know what broadcast frequency Channel 3 operates on in order
to watch Channel 3.  So why should you have to know all that geeky
stuff like the difference between an executable file and a data file,
when all you really wanna do is look at email and pictures?

	With this in mind, both Apple and Microsoft (and maybe
Commodore and Atari, for all I know) began blurring the distinctions
between "data" and "executable files".  That I know of, the Mac never
had visible file extensions, and had no way to view them without
special programs.  Windows had visible file extensions in some of the
early versions, but Win95 came shipped to hide file extensions by
default.  Sure, you could turn 'em on if you wanted...if you knew
where to look for the specific command to enable them...and assuming
that you knew they existed in the first place.  And this last bit is
not a safe assumption to make, on the whole.  There are a lot of
people out there who don't know what a file extension is because they
never operated a computer when the default was to show them.  They got
their first computer after Win95 was released, and so they got a
computer with file extensions turned off by default.  So they don't
know about file extensions.  All they see are a bunch of pretty icons
on their desktop, and when they click on the pretty icons, Stuff(tm)
happens.  It might as well be magic for all they understand the
process.

	As a consequence of the above, there are a significant number
of computer users who have no idea at all about the difference between
a "program" and a "data file."  They click on a JPG file and *fwoom*
there's the picture.  I can guarantee you that if you went to my
mother and told her "Mrs. Burner, I'm going to remove all of the JPG
viewers from your hard drive." and then subsequently asked her to
click on a JPG file, she would have no idea why the picture wasn't
coming up.

	And she's not the only one.  She is, in fact, an average
computer user these days.  Most computer users are more like her, and
less like you and me.  And this is an increasing trend; all the geeky
types like us are already on the Internet, so the only ones left are
the non-geeky types like, well, my m0m.

	In an earlier message in this group, you mentioned that you've
never had a virus/trojan/worm/etc infect you in over 17 years of
computing.  I can make the same claim.  I've been playing with
computers for over 20 years.  In that time frame I have never run a
virus checker, and in that time I have never been infected with a
virus/worm/trojan/etc.  The reason for this is because I understand
how viruses and so forth are transmitted.  Viruses and their ilk are
programs.  They are executable files.  And as I've outlined above,
people like you and I understand the distinction between "executable
files" and "non-executable files."  Since I'm aware of this
distinction, I do not execute attached executable files if I receive
them in email, whereas I'll freely open up non-executable attachments
like JPGs or HTML links.

	But as I've also outlined above, people like you and I are the
exception, not the rule.  Most people *don't* understand the
difference.  Thanks to companies like Microsoft and Apple, most people
aren't even aware that a difference exists, much less understand what
that difference is.  

	So, harking back to your statement above, "exercising good
judgement in what programs one downloads and runs on one's computer"
carries with it the inherent assumption that one understands the
distinction between "program" and "data."  Most people simply won't
understand why they can safely download Movie #1 (which, unbeknownst
to them, is in AVI format and will activate the built-in AVI viewer
which comes with Windows) but not Movie #2 (which, unbeknownst to
them, is an EXE file with a self-executing viewer and, possibly, a
virus).  To the average user, they're both just movies, so what's the
difference?

	These are the challenges I face on a daily basis.  You haven't
lived until you've tried to explain the difference between
"executables" and "non-executables" to someone who isn't aware that
there's a difference at all.  =)
