I most definitely was having problems. Anywhere from 5 minutes to 2
hours into the game, I would lose all sounds except when I jumped/fell
and when I would get hit by the mobs. 

My limited testing has given me all sounds for many hours at a time.

Better sound quality? hard to say. When I didn't have any sounds for
hours and hours of playtime, there's not much to compare it against. As
far as normal windows sound? /shrug, they're still there.
