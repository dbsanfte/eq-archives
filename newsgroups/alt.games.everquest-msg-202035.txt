The explanation was tailored to explaining the joke and yes your
explanation is a better technicial explanation, except for your smart
arse comments at the front. Yes, muscles are broken down by the body if
they are not used and that process can result in fat, if the calorie
intake is not reduced below current needs. The body is usually very good
at putting energy away for a "rainy day", which is one part of why the
porportions of "fatties" in western society is growing.

Fatties can do two things to move towards becoming Arnolds (if that is
what they wish) reduce calorie intake and increase exercise (swimming,
bicycling, walking are best in that order). That will start taking off
the fat if your net energy demand is higher than your calorie intake.
The really hard part is that the body has a few tricks up its sleeve to
induce you into higher calorie intake.

The lobotomy and weight training stuff are optional for the Arnold part.

A hard part in it all is having a lifestyle where the
swimming/bicycling/walking is part of your normal routine.
