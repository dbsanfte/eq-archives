Let me get this straight cause Ive hunted a tad in EQ as a Druid. Nuke
Giant twice without snaring first? Man you must have the improved
version of Sow or one long assed reach.  Those hillbillies are fast
when provoked and dam deadly at the range of player that gets good xp
on em. Just snare the mob like your mama taught ya and deal with the
occasional lost mob. Easiest way to get killed is fighting over a mob.

Lets change up the discusion a bit..why doesnt verant help you
identify an agroed mob? Make the name flash red or something, anything
would be an improvment.
