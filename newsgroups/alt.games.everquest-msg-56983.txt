Well, it could be a matter of the name passing the obscurity test as far as 
the guide is concerned. Like on my own characters... "Parsifal" is actually 
pretty obvious, and liable to be reported any time; but if I had named him 
"Rienzi" instead, I would be very surprised if a GM -or one in a hundred 
players- took an interest on it. Let's face it, there is a difference in 
degree of obscurity between Arlo Guthrie and "Jon Bonjovi" or "Elvis 
Presley" 

Although I think "Cole Porter" would be a kick-ass name for either a Bard, 
or a Wizard/Druid. :)
