    At my level clerics usually don't use gems up (symbol rarely used), and
when they do I figure they can carry their own but I tend to offer to
donate. I carry enough extraneous shit around, including my own spell
components, and I figure even the most bone-laziest of clerics can figure
out how to buy and carry their own freaking spell components.

    If however I was regularly grouping with clerics who use dots constantly
and this adds up to 500pp - 1kpp per day I'd happily carry dots around.

    Please take into account that EQ is a different game at different levels
and what someone says about it may be true and applicable for their level
and completely wrong for yours.
