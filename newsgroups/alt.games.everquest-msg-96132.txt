Well, I have a lvl 43 HIE cleric.  I believe I solo'd up until lvl 7 or 
8 I believe when I did some orc camp groups in EC.  After a couple of 
lvls of that I headed back to BB to camp the undead chessboard for a few 
lvls.  The chessboard is pretty good solo experience for a cleric with 
your undead spells.  You may want to get a partner at first though to 
reduce your downtime.  Other than that, I'd say make good friends with 
warriors and enchanters.  :)  They'll save ye arse later on in life.  
hehe.  Anyway, have fun.  Enjoy the low lvls when you can solo 
effectively, because you'll be sitting on your ass most of the rest of 
your life from around lvl 20 on.  :)
