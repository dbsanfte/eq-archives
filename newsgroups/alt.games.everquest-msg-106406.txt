But see, I didn't come here putting forth a theory that goes against "common
knowledge".  In essence, I've got nothing to prove.  Beyond that, I'm far
too lazy to go ripping through logs to "disprove" a test with such obvious
bias and bad basis as yours.

The fact that you don't grasp that your test has bias that prevents it from
proving *anything*, shows that this is a pointless discussion.  When you get
around to actually doing a "test", then perhaps you will get some
counter-tests posted.

You tested whether AC is a stat?

Damn, next you gonna test whether food is edible?

Your "trivial" refutation was a comparison of level 25 to level 27.  Your
*actual* comparison was of a larger level range, at lower levels even
where the progression in abilities is faster.  Again, you make it obvious
that you actually don't *understand* the flaw in your test.
