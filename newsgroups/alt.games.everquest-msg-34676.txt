lol th...i guess i shouldn't have painted with such a broad brush stroke...

please substitute my "everyone" comments to "certain individuals"

as for leaving them to their own...that's pretty much what i've done...i've
posted a few comments here and there and come back a few days later to see

i only came here because a guildie had mentioned that he kind of screwed up
here and i wanted to help clarify that he's not that bad of a person...what
i saw instead was a lynch mob filled with hypocritical assholes...

c'est la vie...
