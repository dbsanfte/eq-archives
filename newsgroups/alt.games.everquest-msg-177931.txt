I'm saying they aren't but the quality of game play can't be matched by
any other game.  It would take a hell of a lot to make me quit
perminantly.  I did quit for 3 months on account of a certain bug they
had, after I'd heard it was fixed I was back sceptically for awhile.  I
was fine until this last patch.  Now I've got continuing bugs that make
me sceptical again, they aren't quite enough to make me quit yet, but
I'm close...
