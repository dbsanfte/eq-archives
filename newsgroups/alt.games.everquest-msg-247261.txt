I think the problem is that it doesn't have its roots in fantasy fiction.

Bilbo tells the group, "I'm gonna go check Smaug's aggro range.  I have 
          my ring, I should be safe."
Gandalf tells the group, "D00d, he sees invis!  You can't toy with a mob 
          like that, we have no cleric."
