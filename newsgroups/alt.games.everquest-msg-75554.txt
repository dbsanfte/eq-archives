If you're a low level bard (below 8) you won't be able to equip the Lute until
you throw a training point in it at level 8.  One thing I have noticed is that
on my level 8 bard (Vah Shir) that when I'm playing Selo's running through
Shadeweaver's, it gives me a message about my skill going up in Percussion
instruments, but I have my Shield and Claw armed.

This would lend some credibility to the fact that some of our skills will go up
without the use of an instrument.

Will keep you posted .....
