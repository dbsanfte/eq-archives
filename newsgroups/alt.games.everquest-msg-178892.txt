This happened to us on our first AD kill.  This ogre was just hanging around
up in the prep area.  A wizard invited him into group and then tossed him to
zone-in, to much laughter in /gu.

If they have the courtesy to ASK, I have no problem.  But all too often,
they just show up and expect to be allowed to get the flag, or assume that
they have some sort of right to it.  Getting a zone flag should mean that
you have a certain level of competency that will insure that you can handle
the zone you just got flagged for.  Ninja-flaggers by definition lack that
competency.  While allowing people to see new content is good, I'm perfectly
happy leaving some people behind.

On Povar, PoV has become "The New Velks", because enough people have gone
through the PoJ trials to get access to it that it's starting to get really
crowded, with all the drama that implies.
