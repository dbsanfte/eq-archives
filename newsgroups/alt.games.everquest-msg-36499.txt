The Saga of Yahweh ben Yahweh
By Dr. William Pierce

Hello!

An Associated Press news story recently caught my attention. The story
was about the release from prison this week of a Black religious leader,
who calls himself Yahweh ben Yahweh. His name actually is Hulon
Mitchell. He's a former Black Muslim, and, in fact, he ran a Black
Muslim mosque in Atlanta for a while in the early 1970s, until he was
accused of sexual improprieties with underaged Muslim girls and dipping
into the collection plate. He dropped out of the Nation of Islam, where
he was known as Hulon X, and in 1978 founded his own church, the
so-called Nation of Yahweh, with a religion based on Judaism. He calls
his followers "Black Hebrew Israelites" and tells them that they, rather
than the Jews, are the "chosen people" ordained by God to rule the
world, as described in the Old Testament. He took for himself the name
Yahweh ben Yahweh -- that's Hebrew for "God, the son of God."

So why should we be interested in yet another megalomaniac religious
cult based on Judaism? Well, the thing of interest to us about the
Nation of Yahweh is the initiation requirement Hulon Mitchell
established for the elite, inner circle of his church, the so-called
"Brotherhood." The requirement was the murder of a White person, and the
bringing to Mitchell of some evidence of the murder, such as an ear or
even the head of the victim. In fact, Mitchell preached to his whole
congregation that the killing of White people -- of "blue-eyed devils"
-- is pleasing to Yahweh.

By the time the police finally wound up Mitchell's race-murder cult in
November 1990 and packed Mitchell off to prison, his followers had
butchered and mutilated at least 23 men, women, and children, 14 of them
in Miami alone. Some of the victims were recalcitrant members of his own
church, and the Associated Press story doesn't give a racial breakdown,
but the figure I've seen elsewhere puts the number of White victims at
16. Mitchell spent a little over 10 years in prison. That works out to
about eight months for the murder of each "blue-eyed devil." He was
released on parole earlier this week.

You didn't hear about it? You didn't see anything about it on CNN or
network television? You shouldn't be surprised. It's not the sort of
news that the bosses of the controlled media want you to know about.
There was a story about it last Saturday in the Washington Post, but the
entire thrust of that story is the infringement of Mitchell's civil
rights by the conditions imposed on him by the parole board that
released him. The Washington Post article is not headed "Black Cult
Leader Who Ordered Ritual Murder of Whites to Be Released." Oh, no! A
headline like that would be considered "racist" by the people who run
the Post; they are afraid it might make White readers wary of Blacks. It
might even lead some readers to ask questions, such as, "Why has this
nutcase Black murderer been turned loose?" -- although I myself am not
so optimistic about the ability of White Americans to figure out who
their enemies are and react appropriately....
