My skills are very pitiful too, my group normally take great delight in
getting me to disarm the chests, but every now and again they get to close
and share the love :)

I would have expected the chest drops to be random.

Now I have a ratonga scout on the go, I have disabled the xp bar and kept
fighting mobs which are green in order to build up my skills - it helps but
it may be harder at your level (and you may prefer to hunt for xp!).

With the new patch there was something about being able to try and disarm
even if the chest was above your level, you could still have a go.
Another good thing is if there are more solo mobs in the patch, you may find
something your level :)
