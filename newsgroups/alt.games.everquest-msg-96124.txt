This is fantastic news!

Restricting Resurection to clerics did 1 thing only.  Made that class the
cash cows on servers.   I have seen clerics charge folks 500 pp for a rez
before.  No other class in the game gets that kind of "screw you" money for
something that valuable.

SoW & Ports = convenience.
Resurection can = days of game play exp loss and it can be totally out of
your control how you died.

The only other class they need to "fix" then are the wizards being the only
ones that can get you to planes.  Then they will have balanced it out.  A
crash with your corpse on a plane can mean no retrieval possible until you
can find a wizard to get you there for the CR.  That sucks.
