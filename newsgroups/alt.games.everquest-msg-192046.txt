I completely agree with this, however in DSP it doesn't really seem to make
much difference. I regularly fought there and found that any camp along the
wall is likely to get trained, and fighting in the middle just gets too many
adds.

The problem is to do with the use of SoW. Many higher level characters zone in
from NL and pelt it over to ME picking up mobs along the way. They're
typically way ahead of the mob pack, so by the time they zone the mobs will
not have reached the zone. Naturally they then turn back and start wandering
back to their spawn point, picking on camps along the way. To this end I
usually found that fighting at the zone line was actually safer, as it gives
the group an opertunity to zone out with the trains as well instead of simply
getting wiped by them! Add to this the fact that one of the best camps in DSP
happens to be right next to that zone line, so where else are you expected to
be?

However, I suggest the first corner (between the wall and the hill extending
perpendicular to it) beyond ME towards GE. The trains are typically to ME and
many fewer players are making to run to GE. I found this a good camp point for 
the gatherers as it doesn't give any more work for the puller (infact it's
better if you have a FD class as it gives them some more room to split mobs)
and has the benefit of far fewer trains.

More annoying is the idiot who kept shouting about trains to the hedge in
PoN. His camp was pulling to the there, but kept getting wiped out by adds
from other players zoning out. That's just plain dumb. Trains to the GY are
more annoying, but most people try to come in via the back so as to path the
mobs furthest away from incoming players. It's not as if there's much option,
except die and hope you'll get a rez. That's actually a very good option at
the high end as with 96% rez it's often safer just to try and train the mobs
away from the rest of the group and die honourably somewhere else. But with
lower level clerics in the group I can see why people (try to) zone out.
