Early on I didn't notice, because I mostly grouped with friends and was
learning the game.  It didn't feel wrong to be doing KFC with friends and
getting a couple of blue xp a day and having fun, and not really realising
it was well below the level we should have been fighting.

Dreadlands was a shock - mobs had 'loads' of HP and hit really hard.  It
was DL where I first learned how useful both haste and slow were, and I
started collecting money for 'proper' armour.

Half-way through LDoN it was horrific.  I stopped playing my warrior after
a few weeks in LDoN when it became truly obvious that he couldn't maintain
aggro in groups doing LDoN's which needed to move at a fast pace, and so
didn't adjust to my gear.

I was pretty down about the class during that stage (I think around level
53).

I had a long phase of playing other toons, and then they revamped the
disciplines and I spent about a month reading the Steel Warrior website.  I
got the droga weapon combo, the new discs, and discovered I could, by
working hard, hold aggro in fast moving groups.  But that alas, I couldn't
take much damage.  So I went back to the Steel Warrior website and read the
rest of the stuff, and finally realised what I'd been doing wrong when
gearing up.

After that, it was a long hard slog to get to the point where I felt
comfortable tanking in PoI, then PoN.  Then at about 58, I was mortified to
discover I could earn xp on my Necro by kiting PoV outer, but couldn't tank
anything in PoV without a mid 60's support group keeping me alive.  The
high 50's and low 60's for tanks, in PoP, are terrible unless you've got
gear well beyond your normal means at that point.

So I saved and saved and did some AA, and bought some more gear.  At around
60 I started duo'ing in Natimbi with my then mid 50's shaman, and earned
the basic defensive AA which mitigate not having the best gear in the game.
We were xp'ing in groups in Veksar and Droga and selling the loot and
splitting it between us, and that bought some ornate, and I finally felt
like I might be getting somewhere.

The one day, suddenly, at about level 63 or 64, we went to Torment (when
they made it a hot xp zone), and I was tanking stuff in PoP which hit for
400 and not dying.  And it's gotten better since then.  More ornate, then
magnetic, and now finally OoW tier 1 / DoN level 70 / DoN cultural armour
and I'm running about 11.5khp 2050ac buffed.

When DoN first came out, and before I hit 70, the mobs in the Creator
missions would chew through me, and I felt like my gear was underpar again,
but no where near as bad as when I'd first tried PoP.  Another 200ac fixed
that and now MPG / RSS / DoN are all fine but challenging.

Playing a warrior has been incredibly frustrating and hugely rewarding over
the years.

For me, the biggest help was being in a social guild, with a good core of
regular players, and being able to help each other develop at a good pace
without the pressure to only earn xp or only grind here.  Also, having a
core of friends to play with, and splitting the cash earned by selling loot
drops so that everyone always earned something helped too.  I couldn't have
got where I am in the game without the support of the guild and my friends.
