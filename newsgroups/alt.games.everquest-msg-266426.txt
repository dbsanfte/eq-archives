Yeah, I was getting a bit antsy yesterday when I kept checking the EB 
website for the status of my collector's edition order.  The webpage said 
the CE was sold out, and didn't show my order had shipped.  Turned out to be 
a glitch on their page, it did ship and I got it today.  But apparently a 
lot of CE pre-orders got stuck due to the custom's delay per Sony.
