Ok not to keep picking nits here, but I'm a little confused.  You don't have
a chanter or bard on your list of characters played either.

I just levelled a baby chanter to 12 to make Viscous Mana for me. She
already has quite an arsenal of crowd-control options like, charm, fear and
root. I think she gets Mezz at 16.  In a full group with tanks that just
pile on and kick the shit out of everything that comes along, crowd control
is not that important, but in a smaller group, or a duo it can be vital.

Don't underestimate the importance of slowing and hasting.  That is
considered to be a strong point for a shaman, but Chanters actually get
better haste at a lower level than shamans.

I see your point, I just hate to see it made because I enjoy the benefits of
KEI so much.  I think we all know that KEI will see a nerf someday, it
really is overpowering for lower levels.  All I can say is enjoy it while
you can and get as many levels out of it as possible while it still exists
in it's current state.

KEI allows a lot of classes to solo better and for people to gain exp in
smaller groups or duos.  I know EQ is supposed to be a social game, and the
developers want everyone to group up, but it's just not possible all of the
time.  We've all spent a lot of time on our butts LFG.  If KEI lets you get
out and get some exp instead of standing around with your finger up your
nose then I'm all for it.
