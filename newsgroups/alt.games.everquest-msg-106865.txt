 The wurms are a lot more annoying than the Loachs. (Although it's been
awhile since I went that far into SS so maybe Loachs are wurms. I
thought they were wyverns though). They warp just like ToV wurms. Verant
really needs to work on pathing for those things. I used to use Eye of
Zoom a lot to pull those and still get whacked around a lot.

due to that. It's easy to say heal earlier, but when you have a mob like
AoW that's easier said than done.
