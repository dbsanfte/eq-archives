Well above 100, I assume you meant? 

The cutoff seems to be somewhere around 200 FR for Rak. I can keep a
60+ tank alive indefinitely against him if the tank's FR is over 200. 

I have duo'd him with a 65 SK before, messing around trying to get
Jade Reavers for some friends and made the rest of the group watch
while we tried him. We got owned on our first attempt w/o FR buffs.
2nd attempt was trivial once we buffed correctly. 

Rgds, Frank
