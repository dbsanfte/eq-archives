The "getting stuck" part is a bug: Sony apparently didn't flag all the
required files as needing to be downloaded, so people zone into the new
Bazaar but have old geometry files and their client thinks they can't
move because they're in a wall or something.  (And if you look in the
direction of the Arena, you'll see people falling like raindrops into
it.  The server tells your client the people are at such-and-such loc,
and your client deduces those people must be falling because they're in
midair, so it shows you the people falling until the server sends fresh
loc info.)

Anyway, it's easy to fix, but you have to know to do it.  Just go into
the Advanced options in the patcher, and turn on the checkbox for Luclin
(I turned on all the boxes for the expansions I own) and tell it to do a
full file check.  Fixes it right up.

I expected yesterday's one-hour patch to be fixing the Bazaar bug, but
I'm still seeing people bitching in the bazaar /ooc, so I guess not.
