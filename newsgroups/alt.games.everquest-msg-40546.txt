The Ultimate guide and cheat to going to FoB. :-)

It is easy as pie. Take the shuttles from BB to FV. Go to the LOIO. 

Two choices, enumerated below.

The most travelled is when you get to the bridge, get a SoW and an
invis. Run to the creek and up the creek until a Drachnid kills you or
you get to the LOIO.

The second is go to the wall, on the LOIO side, and follow the wall to
the LOIO. Drachnids will hang out near the wall, but just keep moving.
When you zone in, take a rest.
 
Zone back out to FV, and go left, keep running until you hit the zone
to the Swamp of No Hope. Follow the left wall until you see Cabilis,
skirt it and take a left before the bandit camp and to the FOB zone.
After the FOB zone, go left around the big cistern of sand. That takes
you to the ramp at the cistern. Stay FAR away from the stupid guards.
