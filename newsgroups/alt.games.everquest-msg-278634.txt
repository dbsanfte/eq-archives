To be fair I things may have changed substantially since I last played
I know they were changing when I left but I stand by my assessment
given the posters stated desires.. Also I did say it's class
dependant. If exploring is so easy in EQ2 how come I used to see all
those dead bodies laying in Nek and folks constantly bitching about
getting through Nek to reach TS or reach quest objectives. Lots of
TPWs there as well just running through the zone. Lots of deaths means
lots of XP debt. I must add that the meaning of 'exploring' to me is
looking everywhere, discovering new sites and vistas, mapping areas
out etc. and not just sneaking and running past certain mobs in order
to complete a quest. 

Also certain areas are locked to you in EQ2 until you meet certain
conditions or levels. *Nothing* is locked to you in WoW if you wish to
venture there. Also you may be able to visit zones in EQ2 but you
can't hunt much unless you follow the main path, Commons > Nek > TS
etc and are of a suitable level. In WoW you can both explore and hunt
in *many* areas. There are multiple areas that cater to the  same
level ranges. No zoning in WoW either apart from cities and instances
:)).

I agree that if you get killed you can get your shard back. However I
based my reply *on what the original poster said*; that he was fed up
of getting killed a lot. That given I didn't think he'd like lots of
shard runs and the associated debt ;).

I'm not anti EQ2 at all apart from a couple of issues I have with the
game that a *lot* of folks share but lets be honest here the original
poster wanted a game where *he can explore anywhere at will and also
solo well*. That really sounds *far* more like WoW to me than EQ2. Are
you really saying that somebody who solos and likes to explore lots of
different areas without getting killed a lot is better off in EQ2 than
WoW?

I do admit that I neglected to mention in my reply that my view is
based on playing Freeport but I didn't think this was relevant to
someone who didn't know the game. It maybe entirely different coming
from the Qeynos side, I never played it. Certainly no Nek to get
through though, lol.

I admit my experience with EQ original is way out of date but when I
played circa Kunark times you could go to any zone. You'd die for sure
in much higher level areas, but you could go if you so desired. Again
this may have changed though. 

If you are interested in why I quit EQ2, for now at least, see my
posting in the thread 'Caster's Realm: Disturbing Trends in Massive
Online Gaming.'
