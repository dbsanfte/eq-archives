Nope, you get the exp back only on the very first rez you accept.  You can get
ported back to your body again and again... and in fact this can be an important
and useful tool once you have your epic... but the exp is once only.

Yes, from the zero exp one to the 96% one, they are all the same.  There is one
exception, CSrez, which has no rez effects and leaves you at full health.  Of
course having your own personal GM who will follow you around and rez you
whenever you die is difficult to arrange, unless you are on the Legends server.
