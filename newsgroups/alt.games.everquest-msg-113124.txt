When you have a charater that is severely underequiped for their level,
(with a title so everyone looks) then you will understand why people dont
like being inspected. Now I dont get to know, so I cant run off. great. I
suppose i better get ready for some serious flaming over my equipment.
Thanks verant. I dont suppose turning inspections off ever ocured to anyone.

Thanks to all those replyees who brand me in the category of nutcase or
stupid or idiot because im a bit embarassed over my equipment. Shows a
remarkably poor understanding of people. Not surprising for this NG.
