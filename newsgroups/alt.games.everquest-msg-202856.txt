No one in here.  Just delete your characters with all their slots full.

Here's your hat, glad you're leaving.

Here, let me get the door for you.

Ahh, I knew you'd show up again Crash.  You still haven't explained how me
getting a KEI adversely affects your game in any way.  My group was in Tower of
Frozen Shadows again last night wearing off the last of a left over KEI and
having a blast.  Nobody else in the zone but our group.  We were laughing and
talking and having a blast with a KEI on and we had almost zero downtime. 
Please explain how us doing this is "ruining the game" like you say.  You
haven't explained it and you wont.
