Will you include yourself in this category? After all, aren't you the
one who felt he had to browbeat Taras for his very on-topic FAQ? How
many off-topic posts have you made just to call Bizbee names? 

>According to Mindspring it's all legal and okay

Ah, I see what's going on... Mindspring wasn't impressed with your

going to pretend to take the high road.

I remain unimpressed.
