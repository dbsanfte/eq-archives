Kind of a debate stirring on Graffes about a story making the rounds on
the boards.

http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19148.topic

The basis for this is that supposedly a six man team from Dark Horizons
took down Vindi with three rangers, two clerics, and a chanter.

Figured you'd have heard if it was true.
