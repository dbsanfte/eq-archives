I agree totally...

The problem with VI is they have the BIG BUSINESS syndrome, that is "The
customer is not always right and if they are, screw 'em we have several more
who will pay us for our services."

Big Business today has realized that the word of mouth does not directly
effect sales. Small Business must abide by the rule the customer is always
right, if they don't then they will not survive to become Big Business. Best
Buy is a prime example, several articles about bad return policies and poor
customer service and still they had a record year. In Best Buy's defense I
have noticed that the one here is making efforts to change that. (Way to
go!)

VI is Big Business. 420,000 paying a minimum of 9 bucks a month
(conservative number). Now it costs money for development, bandwidth,
hardware, admin, and misc. I bet that they are still taking in a healthy 50
percent profit or better. So one person leaves and bad mouths them, who
cares they were a troublesome client. 1000 people leave and bad mouths them,
who cares they were troublesome clients. As long as the profit stays above
the 30 percent mark who cares. With the release of new games they are
refilling the losses of clients of one game with clients of the new games.

As far as telephone support I can say this, I have not had a bad experience
with VI, as a matter of fact they seem to have been above average. As far as
petitions that too has been a positive experience when needed, but lately it
does seem to take a real long and inexcusable amount of time for resolution.
