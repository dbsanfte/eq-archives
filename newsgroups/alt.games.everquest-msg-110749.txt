No, you simply misunderstood.  When I referred to updating the
database, I was referring to the *morality* changing, not the makeup
of those deciding it.

No, I like it when you use rough words and concepts....

Universal, in the sense of every last human being on the planet
agreeing to them?  No.  Nor is it necessary that they be so.  It
matters not a whit whether that last serial killer in the third cell
down on death row agrees with them.

Unlike some in this thread, I am not arguing for an absolute notion of
good and evil.  I am arguing that there exists a *common* definition
of good and evil, subscribed to by the *majority* of humanity, and
that it is as changeable as all other things human.

Third-level or not, you snipped the portion inconvenient to your
argument.

Do you always avoid addressing points by asking questions of your
questioner? :-)

In any case, there is nothing for me to address.  My original post is
there for anyone who wants to to read.  In context, I think it's
abundantly clear what I meant.

If there was no difference between the two sides, why then did not
more countries join Germany and her allies?  Certainly in the early
years of the war things were going all Germany's way, no?  Surely
makes sense to jump in on the side of the winner.

Even before the truth was known about what Germany was doing to the
Jews and others, Germany had already lost the moral advantage by being
the aggressor in a war of conquest.

How does it not?  "Good" is an invention of humans.  The way the
majority of humans use the word good  is then of necessity the
definition of the word good.  A scientist may be able to tell us that
most of us use some scientific term incorrectly, but there is no final
arbitor in the case of good and evil.  Unless...

It seems to me you are attempting to deny an absolute notion of good
and evil while at the same time hanging onto some of the benefits of
such notions.  What on earth do you mean by "right?"  Are you and Kaev
secretly in agtreement? :-)


This may very well be my last post to this thread.  The company has
been pleasant, but I tire of the subject (as most others probably have
long ago) and I sense no one is convincing anyone else at this point.

Last one out, turn off the lights and lock up please?
