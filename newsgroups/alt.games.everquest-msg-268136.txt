See below. The this is self-defeating at the low game. (At least in EQ1)

Not really. The concept of a 'raid' itself was introduced fairly late. 
Prior to that 6+ independant groups simply worked in concert, with one 
lucky dps group getting all the xp.

Other than negafen and vox, prior to zone instancing, there are really 
no limits on who or how many can engage a mob. EQ really doesn't support 
it... sure it -could- be grafted on now, I suppose. But that would be a 
radical shift, and one likely to upset the established raid game, and 
raid mentality, in EQ1.

Big difference.

At low levels xp is more important than gear. At the high levels this 
reverses. There is no motivation to zerg low level content with a raid, 
because raid xp comparatively sucks; they are better off taking 1 group 
content in 1 group. 

As you approach endgame, xp relevance tapers off, and gear relevance 
ramps up... and at that point, the faster you can kill the mobs the 
better. Nobody raids for xp.

Fair enough.
