Try fear-kiting at the hornet's nest. It's out of the way, never seems
to be camped, and is excellent for fear-kiting because of the ghetto
pathing there (not sploit pathing, but a nice tight fear path.)

There's a ledge north of the hive. Set your pet up there. Pull with
darkness. Run back to the ledge. Send in the pet. Hit fear. The wasps
are easy to single pull. As long as you avoid the scoriae hornets
until you hit 49, you shouldn't get into PvP-vulnerable mana levels
too often.
