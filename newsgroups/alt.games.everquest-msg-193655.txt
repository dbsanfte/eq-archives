Wizards can't strafe run?  Admittedly my wizard is still low level, but, I 
root and nuke with him in Paludal quite effectively.  Using the bolt spells 
means I can stay far enough away to reroot when it does drop.  Eventually, 
wizards get a snare as well.  My wizard has never had better than Breeze 
cast on him, and manages somehow.  Being on test, he is also completely 
untwinked, and practically naked too.  He has 3 pieces of newbie quest 
armor, a couple of pieces of the armor that drops off the mushrooms in 
Paludal, and some cloth.  He still wields his newbie weapon.
