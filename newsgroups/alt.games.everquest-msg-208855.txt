Hmm, I was going to say that USB ethernet for a game like EQ is slightly
dodgy because the adapter requires extra CPU processing and might give you
moments of extreme lag or dropped packets. Since you say it was working fine
for a few months I'm stumped, although it might be worth trying a PCI
ethernet card anyway. They usually cost �10-15, my Belkin card (which I
recommend BTW) was �9 from eBuyer.
