Scenery: NFP before bazaar. ooc, shout and auc is streaming by. A dwarven
cleric (lets call him Boomi)  SS armor (BP was still hate i believe) and his
epic is sitting in front of the bank. He is selling some stuff and looks to
twink an alt.

Noob_01 enters the picture from the right.
Noob_01 steps up to the dwarf .
Noob_01: He dude i am new here. gimme a sow i am on CR!

Boomi thinks: well perhaps he learns to say please. and a noob usin eq
terminology hmm. /who noob_01. result: lvl9 human pally. oh well.

Boomi: nope
Noob_01: u fucktard i am on a CR dammit. gimme a sow!
Boomi: nope
Noob_01: u bastard i know u are a caster now gimme sow or i make my lvl60
friend log on and beat u up!

After Boomi stopped laughing, got himself a soda and wiped the tears from
his face he returns to the comp and sees the noob_01 still ranting at him.

Boomi: look lad. i am a dwarven cleric. i cant cast sow. ty
Nobb_01: Oh.
