I was probably a side effect of not being able to /sit while on a horse.
Someone said, 'Well, on a horse, you're already sitting, right?' so they
gave the med ability while on a horse. Casters still have to use their
spells to kill something, and 'agro-list' checking to see if you can
med'n'ride is unfeasible since some greenie across the zone might have
you tagged. The most obvious advantage was to hybrids who could
effectively med and kill at the same time non-stop. Pal/SK especially
could solo blues non-stop ad-infinitum, never running out of mana. This
was clearly 'against the Vision <tm>'. Linking med'n'ride to the attack
button nerfs part of the issue they think is overpowered, while still
avoiding the sit/stand on a horse issue.
