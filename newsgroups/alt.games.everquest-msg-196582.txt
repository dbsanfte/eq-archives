While thats interesting, why do I care about SOW on a mob?  Other than pulling it, that is...
mobs come to us, we beat them to a pulp, they die.  How fast they can run around doesn't
strike me as much of an issue, unless I'm supposed to be the one to go get them, and having
them beat on me all the way back would be a bad thing?

Thinking its because at low health they run, and with SOW run fast.  If thats the case, then
I'm back to the tricky prospect of snaring -before- they reach the run point, since even
unSOW'd mobs run almost fast enough to get out of cast range in the 6 seconds it takes to
drop this on them.  Workable as long as I'm not being beat on at the time.

Why a monk?  The DPS?  The ability to single pull?  What am I looking for, in case the ideal
class doesn't present itself?
