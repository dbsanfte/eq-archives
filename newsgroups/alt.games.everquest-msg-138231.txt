Go to East Karanas and head to the far side of the zone near the ramps
up to HHK.  Between that wall and the hill where Tarbul Earthstrider
hangs out are all manner of Lion(ess) matriarchs, craig spiders, and the
bigger type of spider. (Not enough coffee to recall at the moment.)
Start conning them. That one area can take you safely up several levels,
and if you pull to the wall you won't have any adds. You can stockpile a
lot of silk, too.
