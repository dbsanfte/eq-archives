Ok I'm not really a newbie.  I played EQ for the first nine months after it was
released.  I have a bunch of friends who play now and I'm seriously thinking of
picking it up again.  It's been a good while though.  My question:  Is there a
snowball's chance in hell that my characters will still be there?  How long do
they retain characters.  I realize how long it's been and therefore I'm not
really expecting them to still be there.  I did email verant and they really
didn't give me a straight answer.
Anyone who can give an answer, thanks in advance.
