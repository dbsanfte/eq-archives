Actually, Ogre Wizards does kind of make sense to me, personally.  How 
could an Ogre resist things that go BOOM! :)  Their methods of 
spellcasting would undoubtedly have a more primitive air, but hey, I could 
see it happening.  'Course it'd basically ba a shaman specialized in 
evocation, I suppose. :)

On the other hand, Gnome Necromancers have never made sense to me.  And 
SKs and Pallys?  Naw, I just don't see it. 

So Halfling Rangers... Sure, what the heck.  We're in their world now.
