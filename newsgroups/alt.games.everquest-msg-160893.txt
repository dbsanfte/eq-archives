    Ask the guild on our server that killed him first. They had a lot of
people not get flagged because of that, and caused a zonewide train with
people trying to run there and get back in somehow. Bewteen camping a cleric
and using "the trick" to make sure the flag NPC doesn't depop any guild
should be fine, though.

    And you can't get a corpse dragged in there (too far from area). And
GFlux doesn't work (to get you close enough to /corpse someone in). I wasn't
in the area to ask that levitate and "boosting" be tried, but I bet Lev
doesn't work there. Guess I need to figure out how to be online one hour
before work ends so I can attend an Aerin'Dar killing!

    Just checked our guild message board - a shaman needed a res in HoH
after a wizard from the other guild tried to kite two mobs near the
graveyard and failed. Whenever it looks like something is moron-proof,
nature builds a bigger moron.
