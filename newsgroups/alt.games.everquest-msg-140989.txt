A lot of dragons require that you be in melee range to cast on them.
If you cast on them outside melee range you will get a resist message.
I think you can confirm this by casting an unresistable spell, like
tashanian, outside melee range. It's been a while since I've tried
casting on any of these types of dragons out of melee range, but I
think that holds true.

Mobs I can think of that do this are pretty much all of the Kunark
dragons, and fire/ice giants in Vox's/Nagafen's lair. Level has
nothing to do with is. Certain mobs are marked to act this way, but
it's definitely not just BS.
