  I wanna try the firepots, but they're located way the heck out in the
middle of nowhere, and I don't think my character has enough stamina or
swimming skill to do the equivalent of swimming the English Channel without
drowning.  So I'm looking for one of those nifty little boats you can
control in the Timorous Deep, but the few I've encountered (near the ogre
docks) don't seem to work.  One seems to be a practical joke and it tips
VERTICAL when I click it and makes a door opening noise... uh, OK.  The
second boat doesn't do anything when I click it, and the third I haven't
been able to get in to yet, as it is positioned impossibly.

  Are there "small boats" that I could reach with a minimum of swimming (and
a minimum of exposing myself to hostile creatures), or do I have to hop on
the raft back to Oasis and wait until my character is strong enough to win
that Olympic gold medal in swimming?
