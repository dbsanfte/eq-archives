Not so Dan, dexterity seems to relate to your chances of getting 'critical
hits' from the spells that you land. I've upgraded a few of my items (I'm a
level 56 Wizard BTW) to raise my dexterity, and I've seen a noticeable

dexterity, in my opinion isn't useless, far from it. My dexterity currently
stands at 121 ...
