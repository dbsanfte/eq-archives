Change the Warrior to a SK or Pally for faster aggro (especially the pally
for pacify) and you have my perfect group  Then again i might take the
ranger out for a rogue if i have an sk who snares.  But i like your
thoughts.  Mage DPS post 60 is just insane when you combine nukes with pets
that are effective on these adventures.  I also might trade the shaman for
an enchanter.  That way you get max haste and CC and mana regen (if you
haven't gotten that before)  after all the cleric is there for healing.  All
in all your group works great and i've played that combination and had great
success.  I have played with other combinations and had equal success.  I
just don't ever prefer warriors as main tanks unless its a High End Boss Mob
(hebm from now on).
