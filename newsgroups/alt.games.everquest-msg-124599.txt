It's not just weapons, in fact it's not even mostly weapons.

Monks get:

1) Higher melee skill caps

2) Higher chance to dual wield and double attack

3) Improved damage tables

4) Special attacks superior to kick and bash.

Warriors get:

1) Huuge hit points

2) Generally better armor (but monks get an innate AC bonus)

3) Taunt

4) /disc defensive

In other words while it's tempting to think of warriors as huge damage
dealers there identity is actually defined by their ability to be the
mobs plaything and not die.... or at least not die quickly.

I play a monk and I can tank pretty well. But if there's an overpull,
a hard hitting high level mob, or lots of spellcasters I start wishing
I was a warrior. If there's a cleric with CH sitting behind me, something
I always hope for, then the warriors is a far more efficient target for
healing. Both of these things are starting to become more common.
