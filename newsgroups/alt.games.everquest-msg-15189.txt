I think that's what I was trying to say - he may have *thought* that he
lost his chance of raising skill, but he isn't really losing anything.

Let me explain - say the mob dies a minute faster because someone
helped. It seems he is losing the skillups he would have got from
beating on that mob for a minute. In practice he isn't, because his
downtime is now lower, having avoided a minute of being hit and wounded
by said mob, hence he's ready to go into battle with the next mob
earlier to get more skillups.
