Maybe this is already old news to many of you but I only discovered
this yesterday.  I know about the various player titles, like "Baron",
"Venerable", etc. for players getting so many AA points.  But lately,
seeing I had very little free time, I just spent small amounts of time
working on the pottery skill for one of my characters.  When I managed
to reach 100 skill, all of a sudden I got a pop-up box saying
something like "you have a new title available; press (SHIFT-T) to see
the list of titles".  I went ahead and hit (SHIFT-T) and there was a
box with "Apprentice Potter" with instructions to either click
"accept" to change new title or "cancel" to cancel.  So I got to walk
around with the title "Apprentice Potter Sabriena" last night for a
while, which no doubt commanded much awe and respect from other
players! ;-)

 (later when I got to 100 in baking, "Apprentice Baker" was added to
my list so I'm now "Apprentice Baker Sabriena", at least for the time
being).  

But I'm just curious--is this something that was recently added or has
this feature been around for a while and I only just discovered it
because I just recently reached 100 in a trade skill?

Thanks in advance,
