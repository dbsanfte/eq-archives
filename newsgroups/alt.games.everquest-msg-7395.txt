Not really.
You don't have to hit raid encounters to realize that how freaking
important defensive discipline really is.

Take a level 60 paladin/SK, buff them to the gills, get them the best
possible gear, toss them in Siren's Grotto and ask them to live for 10
seconds that it takes for CH to hit them.

Do the same with a level 60 warrior--hell, he doesn't even need that
much in the way of armor.

When you have 3 entralled <whatevers> double pop you for 220+ and have
an attack delay of about 1.5 seconds, no paladin/sk can tank them well
enough to "make do".

This is why EQ is so fucking broken at the high levels.
