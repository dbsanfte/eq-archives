Well, you see, they *designed* it that way. Horses have some downsides
after all.
- They cost a fortune. (I saved for a solid month for mine. I can earn money
faster than that now, but still it took a while.)
- You can't duck out of a spell to recast when on a horse.
- They can't be used indoors.
- You accelerate/decelerate when moving.
- The cheapest horse is slower than Run3.

Also, their usefulness scales with your level. As you level up, you
med faster. Thus your horse becomes more useful.
