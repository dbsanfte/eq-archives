You are assuming that the displayed AC is actually directly relavent to
melee combat resolution.  From my observations this is not so.  Others
have commented in this group that at some point during beta the UI
displayed separate values for attack avoidance (from Defense skill and
AGI) and damage mitigation (from armor), which were later merged into
the displayed AC which gives you an approximation of your ability to
withstand melee attacks.  This fits a lot more closely with what I've
seen in-game.

Also, the displayed AC value does not always give you a reasonable
prediction:

A naked L7 with capped Defense (displayed AC around 60) takes very
nearly the same damage over time as a L1 in banded (displayed AC around
155) fighting L2 mobs, the L7 is hit much less often, but for
significantly higher damage per hit than the L1.

In Netherbian Lair I've seen a L26 monk taking almost zero damage from
mobs that would steadily grind up my L25 warrior, and my warrior's ac
was over 50 points higher than the monk's.  For those two characters,
against those mobs, the monk's superior ability to avoid being hit at
all was worth far more than the reduction in damage/hit afforded by my
warrior's armor.  If we'd been fighting mobs a few levels higher the
monk would've likely been quickly slashed to ribbons while my warrior
would've just been ground down a little faster.

P.S. I hope you're not trying to tank xp-giving mobs very often with
an AC under 820 at L54.  My paladin seems to be adequate for a L52
with an ac around 960 unbuffed, I'm thinking your health must drop
like a stone when you get agro.
