Yes, I'm *absolutely* sure that corpse one was rezzed (by myself) and looted
up giving me the experience I needed to re-ding to level 60. I then logged
as the guild Cleric that was on during these wee hours wasn't able to come
to me. I logged back in and waited, and the timer on corpse two indicated
that there were 41 minutes left. However, after rezzing me I had no
experience returned to me whatsoever.

I do understand that the GM's are going to watch out for foul play, after
all, sadly there is always someone ready to try it on, but in this case the
GM was *telling* me that black was blue so-to-speak. I had an instance to
petition a GM a few months ago, again the GM wasn't helpful to me, but oddly
enough a few days later the server was taken down and what had happened to
me was *fixed* in a patch! .. /shrug ..

Anyway, thanks for the replies, and safew hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
