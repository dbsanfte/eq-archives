Didn't work, at least having 40 plat to purchase a blackjack listed
for 20 plat didn't work. BUY button was still grayed out. I will have
to try once more (rereading previous posts) and have 1 plat more than
twice the purchase price.

If that doesn't do it, I may as well file a /bug report unless someone
can say whether a trader can set a price for an item, have it display
on /bazaar, be visible in their "for sale" slots, but be not
purchaseable.

Finally picked up a Shissar warhammer (I think) which cost about
double what that blackjack would have but had a stat bonus to it
though its ratio is slightly worse.

Thanks.
