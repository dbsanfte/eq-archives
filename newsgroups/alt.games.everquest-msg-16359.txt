I know that a lot of spells have level limits relative to the caster.
E.g., except for the lure line of spells, Wizards can't nuke things more
than 6 levels higher than them.

How about the Druid spell Harmony?  My 18 Druid tried it on the tower
guards in NK, and then tried to snare one (which was, of course,
resisted, since they are level 30).  Only one guard came, so it looks
like Harmony worked, despite the 12 level difference.

Would this work on level 40ish mobs?  My Druid is on my second account,
and I'm thinking that if he indeed can Harmony things of level 40, that
could be very helpful for my 50 Wizard on my main account. :-)
