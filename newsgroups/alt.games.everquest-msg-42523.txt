My answer is to play whatever race/class combo that you like and
ignore the people who tell you to play class X as race Y-- or tell
you not to play that class at all for that matter.  Ultimately YOU 
have to play that character, and if you're not happy playing that 
class/race combo, then why are you playing?!  Everquest is a hobby,
not a job!  If YOU are not not having fun, then YOU are wasting 
your time!

That aside, how did I choose my race for my ranger?  Heh, well, 
I just looked at all the female face models for the three ranger
classes until I saw the red-headed wood elf and took a liking to
her.  ;)

Don't fret too much about your starting stats, unless you plan
to play your character naked during its whole career.  I dumped
half of my 20 extra points into strength, half into wisdom-- a
"mistake" people tell me.  <shrug>  It's a mistake I've lived
with for 59 levels. People will still play with me.
