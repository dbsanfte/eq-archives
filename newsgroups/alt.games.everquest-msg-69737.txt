I too have thought about this.  I figure they want to get us to depend on
one another.  The same reason no one can become grand master at every trade
skill (250).  If you could do it all what would be the sense in playing with
others?

It's true that some people exploit this, but honestly, if you have something
somebody else has to have aren't you gonna charge a bit more for it?
