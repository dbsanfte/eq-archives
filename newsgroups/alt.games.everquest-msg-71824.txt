	One Enchanter can't provide Clarity and haste for a 6-group raid; he could
cover the haste if he has a snake but still can't do the Clarity.

	And you're sitting here complaining that raids only ask for one or two of
any given caster class...um, yes, and how many Rangers?

	Cry me a river.

	If you can't solo a caster in the Grey, you're doing something wrong.
