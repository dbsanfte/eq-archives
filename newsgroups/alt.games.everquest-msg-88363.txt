>They are not affected by focus items.

Possibly untrue.  Tseriina drops a mage item which is rumored to be a
monster summoning focus item, tho it has never been fully tested.  My
level 26 mage snuck up to floor 7 to get one when we killed her one
time....

The item has the pet killing effect that all other focus items do.
