How much do you have to spend?  My necro enjoyed an Advisor Robe up to 
her 30s or so.

So common these days that you should be able to find it for 100pp or 
under.

If not, you might think about doing your newb armor quest for a chest 
piece.  Yoinked from www.eqtraders.com:

You say, 'i want to craft a robe'

Talorial D`Estalian says 'Your Unholy Silk Gown is your most important 
and symbolic item you that will be able to craft on your own. I would 
recommend that you have already gone through the steps of crafting your 
other pieces before your Gown. If you think that you are ready you will 
need to collect 4 Halfling Hides, 1 Black Wolf Pelt, 2 Embalming Dusts, 
1 Halfling Toe, 1 Bear Meat and 1 Fish Wine. Combine all of these in 
your box to create the Infused hide used with the Robe pattern to 
fashion your Gown. '


(Note: Talorial is apparently in the necro guild, in the big main room 
you go by before you get to the first set of vendors)

Oh, and while not of huge importance now, try and build up some HP items 
before you get Call of Bones - think that's level 29 or so.  I didn't, 
and I nearly die every time I use the #$!@# spell because I have such a 
bare bones (pun not intended, those in the know) HP count.  :/  OTOH, my 
bandaging skill is shooting up quite nicely. :p
