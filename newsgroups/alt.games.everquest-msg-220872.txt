How about increasing warrior DPS from the front?  Currently you
take roughly a 15% hit to DPS in order to stand in front of a
mob, since the mob then gets to parry, dodge, block, and riposte
your hits, not to mention the stuns.

If warriors had some way (preferably NOT an AA, which merely
solves the problem for the 10% of warriors high enough level and
with enough exp to get the AA, instead of fixing the class for
levels 1 thru 65) to reduce the degree to which their damage gets
reduced by the mob, and Knights didn't have that way, then your
choice would be between the better aggro control but worse
damage, or the slower aggro control but more damage of a
warrior.  Since Knights come, as you say, with other "and so much
more" abilities, giving warriors one as well shouldn't unbalance
things too much.

This also shouldn't encroach on the "real" DPS classes, who will
continue to do more damage than any warrior (after all, this
isn't any better than a warrior attacking from behind...)
