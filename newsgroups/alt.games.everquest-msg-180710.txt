Man. I don't know exactly where you're getting off here, but I should 
clarify something. I'm *not* bitching about anything beyond the fact that 
some servers have screwed up economies - the fact of which is not news to 
anyone - and I would like to make sure I avoid them when selecting a 
server for my new characters. I don't give a flying crap that low level 
players farm tradeskill components and sell it to high level players. 
That's how I came by most of my own gear and will do so in the future. 
More power to us. It's a great system in that regard.

However, I was *never* able to get even 20pp for a leather padding on FV. 
Now I'm not saying that the people on other servers who *do* sell the 
stuff for 20pp to 30pp each are in the wrong in *any* way. I would do the 
same if people would pay it. My concern is that if people *are* willing 
to  pay that much for it, maybe that is an indicator that the economy is 
screwed up. Like I said, you'll never get that kind of money on a regular 
basis on FV, and I believe the economy there is still in pretty good 
shape. If it were simply the fact that higher level players don't want to 
waste their time farming it themselves, then why is 20pp to 30pp not the 
norm on all servers?

I simply went looking at some of the newer servers last night by rolling 
up a new char. on each and running straight to the bazaar to check number 
of people in zones, prices on certain items, etc. This just happened to 
be one point that really stood out, and I was hoping for a little 
clarification or feedback from others' experiences.

Have another cup of coffee, dude.
