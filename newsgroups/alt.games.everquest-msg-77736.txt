Ok, I started a war I play for fun, when I can't really use my main.
The main is a level 54 Shaman. The idea is to go farm some stuff
for the warrior, soloing with my main. Currently, the warrior is
about this:

Velium rings for AC and HP
Snow cougar earrings
Netherbian chitin bp
Crystallized chitin arms
Hero bracer / banded bracer
Rygorr legs
Some ac3 neck thingy with stats .. don't remember
Some AC5 girdle, don't remember :)
Leather boots/back/shoulder
Centi Longswords, dual wield or Centi LS/shaded staff dual

For a twink not really bad. What I really want to replace is
the belt, banded bracer, the rygorr legs with some plate (I
don't like chain look :P ) and the leather parts of course,
the rest I'm pretty happy with. The ideas are:

Belt	-	Straw spun. But how often does this drop and
		where to soo? FM fort is just *too* crowded.

Banded bracer	No idea .. what should I get?

Rygorr legs	Hard to beat. It's just a look question, but I 
		guess it's hard to find soemthing better as
		easily.

Leather		Don't know really. Thought of crafted items, but
		nobody seems to sell them here in EC and the
		quests seem to be annoying :) Black alloy is chain,
		yikes. Same with Rygorr.

So .. where do I go with a lazy, lvl 54 shaman to farm some 
replacements? The idea is to solo everything fast (well uncommon
drops at best .. rares are too annoying), since I need the money
for others things right now and don't want to buy anything. I know
it's "want's it all and in a golden cup" .. but ... any ideas?
