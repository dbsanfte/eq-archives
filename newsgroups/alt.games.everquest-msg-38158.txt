I'm going to loose my cable connection.

I'm about to purchase a house where DSL/Cable internet access is not
available. (damn boonies! lots of land though)

Will the 500ms or so delay up and down from a satellite internet
connection render EQ unplayable?

Will I be forced to play over a 56K modem?

If forced to play over the modem could it(the modem) handle 3 players?
Networking not a problem would 56k (well ok 43K nominal) be suitable
bandwidth for 3 players?


Thanks for your input.
