I wanted to like it. I wanted to love it really but I just couldn't play it 
due to the system requirements. This same machine can run most any other 
game with settings turned up at least somewhat but with VG I had to run with 
them all down so much it looked awful and still lagged so badly as to be 
unplayable. I have nothing against creating scalable graphics but either 
that is some very badly optimized code or it is just overly ambitious for 
the average PC gamer's hardware right now, today. They needed to ship 
something that could run decent right then, when it shipped. Not when people 
bought new systems, etc. The greatest problem they had at launch was so many 
people willing to play it found it ran so badly for them they could not 
begin to enjoy it and that killed the launch numbers and the game still 
suffers for that bad decision. As a software development project, VG was 
very poorly managed and that is no secret today. It's too bad because I am 
inclined to think that as a game itself it is probably very good and more 
akin to the original EverQuest than EQ2 ever was other than pirated lore.

That said, SOE did a remarkable job in fixing many issues in EQ2 to a point 
where many regard it as a very good game today and I hope they can manage 
this with Vanguard which as a game deserved better software development than 
it got at least up to its ill fated launch.

For what it is worth, this is my gaming PC which I readily acknowlege is 
midrange at best by today's standards but again, this computer runs 
EverQuest, ran WoW, and all shooters preceding DX10 just fine with settings 
up. It ran EQ2 pretty well also  on balanced settings. Vanguard often 
crawled in single digits fps regardless of how I fiddled with settings.

Intel 3.2 HT (dual core)
ASUS Motherboard
2 Gigs RAM
BFG Nvidia 7600 OC with 256 MB ram (yes I know this is lame for VG)
Soundblaster Audigy 2 into a stereo system with Bose Speakers
Windows XP SP2 with all current patches applied. DirectX 9.0c
* NOTHING else in memory I might add, no utilities, nothing when I am 
gaming.

I am approaching time to upgrade but for now, the games I play run great. I 
could not see buying a new computer for a game I haven't played long enough 
to know I love enough to justify that expense. There would be no other 
reason for me to spend the money today as all else I use/play works great.
