Actually I would have to disagree here.  There are a lot more porters than
portees these days because of the PoK porting system, so a porter who cheats
the portee will have a very hard time finding people to cheat after a short
time of doing it, and will probably value his customers more.  On the other
hand, portees probably will have less trouble finding a porter they haven't
cheated yet, and will be more willing to cheat.  Also, a porter is spending
a relatively small amount of time and mana, which are usually less valuable
than pp, so when someone gives money to a porter it takes very little effort
on the porter's part to go ahead and provide the service... there's almost
no point in his refusing it after he has the cash.  When a portee gets the
port, he may either be short on pp or not have enough pp to begin with, so
it's very much in his own interests to simply refuse to pay.  Now, I don't
have much experience with either of these cases, since I don't have any
porter chars and I use PoP when I want to get anywhere, but I would think
that for the above reasons the porter is taking a lot more risk than the
portee.
