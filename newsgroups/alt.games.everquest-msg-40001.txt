I still can't get it to work reliably on my Win2k machine with a Voodoo
card.  Yesterday I set my desktop resolution to 1024x768, same as my EQ, and
eventually managed to switch back to EQ after a couple of tries.  The
hotkeys wouldn't work from the keyboard, the mouse worked fine.  I was able
to camp by typing /camp desktop.  It's something I will do only if I
accidentally switch out of EQ.
