I do tech support for DSL, ISDN, and Dial up, and it is not unusual in 
the slightest for me to get a call about a printer, scanner, hard drive, 
sound card, monitor, 'my phone is dead', 'my power is out, why can't I 
get on the internet' (2 of those this year).

I've only had one 'SP2 screwed it' issue, but every machine I've worked 
on that is Xp needed SP2 installed. And we have had some troubles 
installing it, but nothing we couldn't handle.

(the sp2 screwed it machine had a 40 gb drive and chkdsk found 22 gb in 
bad sectors, so I don't blame sp2.)

Hopefully I won't be a victim of hubris, but I've run, let's see... 8 
years since the last virus, and it came from a machine at school, on a 
floppy that I had a report on (teacher required report be printed on a 
laser printer, and I forgot to write protect the disk to print it at 
school). I run antivirus software nowhere, except to do online checks 
every 2 weeks or so.
