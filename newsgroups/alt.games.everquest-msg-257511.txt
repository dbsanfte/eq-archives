I could be wrong, but, I believe warrior and rogue still get a class 
bonus, the class penalties were removed.  Doesn't much matter how they 
ended up removing them, the net result is that they are gone as far as 
killing mobs is concerned.  Could well be there is a death penalty 
difference still, I don't honestly know.
