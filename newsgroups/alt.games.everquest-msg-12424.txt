Sit and med up the cliff edge to the left of the entrance. Nobody
trains there and its near the zone so you can hunt easily.

If you sit by a zone.... well, you're doing it so you can zone if you
get in trouble. Other people do it too. Expect them to; dont sit at
the zone unless you're fighting, or do expect to see people zoning to
get away from stuff...

Pity he didnt shout train, but not everyone does.
