Wow, what is this Vermiculated/Elder Spiritist Armor? hehehe I'm a 19th
level Druid now and I wear leather... I have no money... I buff and SoW
Strangers as I pass them on the trails and heals as well!  I've never asked
for donations or payment until last night.. kind of as jest (since I had
recently aquired stacks of batwings) I walked to the wizzy spires and I
SoWed, Buffed and healed everyone around... then as a funny, I levitated
them all. haha.. I said "Hey, how about some donations for the SoWs?"  a guy
gave me Vembraces of something or other.. wild.. I'd never held such fine
armor.. yeah, I can't wear it of course, but he said I could sell it for
about 6pp.  Wild.. 6pp for a SoW.. cool.
Not sure what my point is..
oh yeah, I'm a Druid, I'm broke, what's this Vermiculated/Elder Spiritist
Armor?
When I start porting others and they waltz up all shiney and spiffy.. they
better have a surname... that's all I have to say.  If not, give me some
money because I've gone through a LOT of play time with barely a plat to my
name... it's time to live the good life.  I hope.. *sigh*
