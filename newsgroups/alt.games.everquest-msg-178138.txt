Don't Turn Your Back
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Don't turn your back, danger surrounds you
Don't turn your back to the dogs who hound you
Don't turn your back, don't show your profile
You'll never know when it's your turn to go

Don't turn your back on intuition
Don't turn your back on superstition
Don't turn your back to your jealous neighbor
He just might blow and spoil the show

Don't turn your back - one chance to save her
Don't turn your back - keep her out of danger
Don't turn your back - she'll return the favor
She wants you so, don't say no

Things are not always what they seem
She won't always say what she means
You'll never know who your friends really are
You'll use that special option in your car

Don't turn your back, danger surrounds you
Don't turn your back to the dogs who hound you
Don't turn your back, don't show your profile
You'll never know when it's your turn to go

Don't turn your back
Don't turn your back
Don't turn your back
