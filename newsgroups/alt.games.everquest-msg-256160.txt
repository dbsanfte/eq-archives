Warriors: dps and tanking
Rangers: dps

Yep. More utility.

Ranger heals are a joke. Needing rangers to kite is maybe 2% of all
raids? Tracking has no use in raid situations, not in a long time. WS?
Monks, warriors, and rogues all have invulnerability discs; sometimes
two.

Yeah rangers might look good when using Trueshot. Shorten the reuse
time on that to ten minutes and maybe we can talk. Until then, its a
nonissue.

Even with the mitigation nerf monks *still* tank better than rangers
by several orders of magnitude. Meems was talking about tanking named
in GoD the other night, yes?

So, outside of fights where you need to kite things around with
someone with snare, and fights with aes or rampage you can get outside
the range of, what exactly do you want a ranger for?

Threads like this just go to show how little people understand how bad
the situation is with some classes.
