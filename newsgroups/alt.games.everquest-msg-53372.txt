I did in my low 40s. I'd end up in groups consisting of me and one or
two melees, and we'd kill stuff in GD and  EW. I could easily draw
enough aggro to make them come swing at me if I sat down and actually
used that to let the melees reverse kite for a hit or two. (Hitting me
might give a defense raise, and the time the mob spent running towards
me was time it didn't spend trying to hit my friends. If I didn't want
to be hit, I just had to stand up. I had snare/ sit/stand aggro down
to an art form for a while :) )
