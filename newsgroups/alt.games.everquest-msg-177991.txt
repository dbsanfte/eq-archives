How do you simulate a heavy load? Seriously?

The obvious methods:
(1) Software agents (simulated players)... do I need to say why this
    won't work? AI just isn't there yet.
(2) Record-and-playback -- record some real traffic for some interval,
    play it back to the server. But the server has just been patched, as
    has the client. The recorded traffic will no longer indicate actual
    behaviour, and certainly not player behaviour to bugs.
(3) Beta testing server. AKA "Test" - you can't force paying customer to
    beta test, and giving accounts away on test has other risks. Not least
    of which is that players have nothing to lose and so griefers and such
    will be more common... skewing the results of your testing. So, a
    beta server for adventurous paying customers instead.
(4) Pay a small army to do your testing. "Subscriptions are increasing to
    US$50/month to pay for our new QC department." Similar drawbacks to (3).

Sony of course uses method 5: do what you can to prevent new bugs in
production, run it through beta... and if something major goes wrong,
fix it ASAP. Personally I find a one-day turnaround on fixing such a major
bug to be astonishing. Real software development projects are rarely so
timely.

There's no doubt that it shouldn't have happened. But I can quite easily
understand why it did.
