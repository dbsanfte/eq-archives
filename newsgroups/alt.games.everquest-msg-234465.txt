Here's the best I could do as far as definitive word from SOE.

NPC Slow Mitigation
- Aurum @ 10:26 PM PST
A new update was posted concerning NPC behavior by Alan VanCouvering today:
  Generally speaking we don't announce new NPC functionality, tricks, spell
effects or other things that we think are part of the discovery of a new
expansion or zone. However, this functionality isn't working properly right
now and in doing so it is causing a bit of confusion.

  With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of
slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause slows
to be less than 100% effective. This is not a "slow cap", when it is working
properly. The best slow will have the best effect.

  This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when
considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not have to
decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full effect or just
turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged, and
making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option when tuning an
encounter. There are some encounters where we would like to see slowing
considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to the point where the
NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed.

  In theory this is a great thing.

  However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this
new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in emails
and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem.

  We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed.

  Alan

So it looks like it wasn't working properly, SOE found out about it and,
presumably, fixed it.
