    It jumps a little faster than it used to. At 61, mobs 48 and up are blue
where you'd expect 46 and up. By 65 it's jumped all the way up to 57+ to be
blue, as confirmed by guildmates in Sebilis. At level 64 I was trying to
confirm how low was blue, and got down to level 55 before I ran out of
people to /con. So at 64 it's at least 55+, and could be a wider range.
