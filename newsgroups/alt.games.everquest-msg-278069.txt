I didn't say "don't spend it". I said "Spend less than what you make."

Its true there's a definate limit to what you need so I guess once your 
'rich enough' you can modify that to "Spend exactly what you make', and 
preserve some wealth, but having a healthy float is a good thing.

It lets to take advantage of bargains, it frees your from being stressed 
out because your about to ding and don't have any money for spells, etc 
etc etc.

As soon as you spend your last dime on an X, a Y will show up that you 
could pick up and flip in the bazaar for enough money to buy that you've 
been wanting Z... except you can't because your broke.

Like I said before: having cash makes it much easier to raise more cash.

Its true saving millions upon millions of plat does you no good, but 
perpetually spending down to your last 50 plat, and then complaining all 
the time that you need money is even stupider.

I know high level people who will hit the bazaar for tradeskill 
components and spend down to the point that they *routinely* can't 
afford their own coffins or corpse summonings, who can't afford to 
resupply on peridots, etc etc etc.
