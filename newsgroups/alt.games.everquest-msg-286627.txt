It never fails to amaze me how you somehow seem determined to
re-invent the wheel on things like this that have been absolute
no-brainers since the first enraging mob was found.

How hard is it to toggle attack off just BEFORE the mob enrages?  One
key press, the quickest possible player interaction can have with the
client.  If I were your Raid Leader I'd be smacking my head off the
desk when you insist on doing crap like this for absolutely no good
reason at all.
