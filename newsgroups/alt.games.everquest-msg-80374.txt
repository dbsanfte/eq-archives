I have kept my swimming skill maxed by swimming up and down the coast in
Northern Ro.  There is nothing in the water and a long straight coastline.
It is painfully boring and painfully slow, but it works.  The other thing
you can do, is go to the docks at Freeport, swim under the dock and into one
of the pilings (like you are swimming into a pole).  Hit the "numlock"
button to keep you going.  Go take a shower, get some dinner, read a book,
sleep, etc., and when you come back several hours later,  your skill will be
way up.

It is  very important to learn to swim in RL and EQ, as there are many good
zones and unpredictable situations where the ability to swim will either
expand your horizons, or save your life.

BTW,  I hope your friend drowned in EQ, not RL.
