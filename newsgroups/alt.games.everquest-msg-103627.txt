I'll vouch for the 'group difficulty with mages' point. I'm currently a lvl
18 (nr 19) on the Antonius Bayle server. Shouting for a group has yet to
prove fruitful at this level. It was fine up to around lvl 14.

I like the mage. However, I also like to group. In fact I would say it is
important to do so to get the xp. It is possible to solo but it's always
nice to have someone help out when you get attacked while you med and you
use a lot of mana against mobs of this level. I find myself grouping with
one or two others at the most now, mainly by bumping into them on my travels
and asking straight out if they want to group. Strangely enough they are
usually wizzies or druids who are having problems grouping. Currently I'm in
East Karana where such small groups can get great xp, picking off crag
spiders etc.

One important point is pet control. I went into Befallen at lvl 17 to try my
pet in a dungeon. You have to be careful as they can either attack the wrong
mob or else you lose them on your travels and they take ages to catch up.
Also they can end up bringing you more than you can handle (or the group for
that matter) which wont make you popular.

just my 2cp's
