> I got so bad headaches from playing Everquest I had to quit.

Don't laugh but this happened to me - I never realized how my monitor had
degraded untill I tried some text at 800 x 600. I was playing 640 x 480 and
never noticed thet the "Y" axis of the monitor was blurred compared to the
"X" axis - nothing would correct it on the monitor adjustments - also I was
using a 15 inch monitor - a bit small for todays resolutions. After a long
EQ (640x480) or a couple letters (800x600) poof my eyes / head / neck / back
hurt. My glasses (nearsighted) focus a couple feet away to infinity and its
hard to see closer - When i finally took off the glasses and brought my eyes
closer I was amazed how I could read the screen at all. The chars had so
much blur. I had bought the best 15 inch monitor but that was 4 years ago. I
replaced with a 15 inch flat screen and have no trouble reading 1040 x 768.
I would also recommend the 17 inch monitors and will go there soon. Some
expert once said put money in the monitor before that extra device (camera
etc). Also consider the monitor placement and your seating. Having used
computers for a long time for word procesing I know you can stress the neck
by placing the monitor to high or low etc. Really for playing EQ for hours
on a weekend is an endurance problem - consider a pillow on the back and
changing positions - sometimes I stand out of the chair for a while
stretching (er medding) and doing simple exercises. Also get pads for hands
and wrists so you do not pinch nerves etc. The studies continue to show that
Games and computers cause a type of fatique after several hours. A type of
concentration / muscular fatigue - even though you are sitting there "doing
nothing". Good luck.
