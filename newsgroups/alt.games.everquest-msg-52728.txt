    If tradeskill items are as good as mob-dropped items, why would I go
after a mob-dropped item? It would, under your system, eventually decay and
I would need to replace it. OR, I can go get a tradeskill-made one as fast
as I can find a tradeskiller/make it myself. Which sounds easier? Even in a
system with mob drops better than tradeskill items, unless the decay rate is
significantly lower than the rate at which the item enters the world (so a
finite stockpile of them can exist), you'll still go after tradeskill
because getting your hands on the mob drop will be too time consuming.

    Me? Gah, hate camping items. I do it the easier way - I level up in
camps where desired items drop. That way, regardless of whether I obtain a
desired item or not I've still done something useful - level.

    With prestige taken away from equipment, it has to be given somewhere
else for folks to "care". In DAoC, it looks like prestige will come in Realm
Points and Titles - so the PvP aspect of the game. Although those guild
crests DO look pretty snazzy. 8)

    The tradeskill items in DAoC are all made with store-bought components.
The only "risk" in making them is whatever risk is required in getting the
cash for the expectation cost of the item, and the possible one-time risk in
questing for the recipe. Compare that with the risk level in EQ (high enough
that many endgame items are only obtainable by a well-equipped guild), and
you can see why I call it "easy".

    Oddly, six hour mob camps only occur when one is levelling up. In the
endgame in EQ, items usually come during raids. During a raid the target mob
is one which isn't camped, but is already up and must be cleared to and
bagged. The one "camping" part of EQ's current endgame is the basic armour
grind in ToV.

    Nor was it ever intended to support them to the degree you wish. By
design.

>it has horrible descepancies in effort and reward

    If EQ has one thing over DAoC, it's that the "reward" part has been made
meaningful.

>ungodly inflation,

    Hrm? If anything, EQ has DEflation - item costs drop over time, not
rise. If you're talking about "to be the best equipped you can be, it takes
X pp" as the example of an inflating cost, you may want to consider that the
best equipped are wearing nearly all No Drop gear which cannot be
purchased - only earned.

>and lends itself to utter saturation.

    Could happen. Tends to self-regulate, though. If item X is desirable, it
will be camped and (assuming inflow rate is sufficient) will eventually
saturate. At which point folks don't camp it because it's "worthless", but
more people come into the game while existing copies are vendored or leave
with folks quitting - so relative supply decreases until it's "desired"
again. Good examples of this are the Skull-Shaped Barbute and Adamantine
Epaulets. These are old-world items that were camped to death pre-Kunark,
and even pre-Velious, so there were a TON of them around. But they have a
fair resale value to vendors - Ad Eps sell for 160 pp to Bubar with Dwarven
CHA. So when they became "worthless", not only did folks stop camping them
but they started vendoring them rather than sit in EC wasting time trying to
sell them. Today, both those items are in reasonably short supply in EC
compared with the demand.

    This mostly happens with items that do not have a unique function, and
which come from pre-50's XP camps, though. But it is an eye-opener to go
through Freeport and check the vendors to see what's on them.

>In short it is not a "workable" economy in that
>it is not a "good" self-regulating economy.

    And what I'm telling you is that I'm in game, observing the economy, and
it self-regulates.

    No - but an economic system where the best items are produced by
tradeskills from vendor-purchased ingredients IS. And that is DAoC. Unless
cash drops are so tightly regulated that items cannot be stockpiled,
there'll be as many of whatever you want as needed. And if cash IS tightly
regulated, well, is there a difference between camping an item for six hours
and camping cash for six hours?

>It is very silly for you to act as if a stable self-regulating
>economic system and a system with rewarding gameplay are mutually
exclusive.

    I'm not. I'm saying that DAoC's design, which you seem to be championing
as the realization of the dream, has its own fundamental flaws.

    If tradeskillers make the best items in game, PvE players will be upset,
period. If drops are the best items in game, tradeskillers will be upset in
proportion to how large the gap is. Someone's going to be unhappy - decide
who.
