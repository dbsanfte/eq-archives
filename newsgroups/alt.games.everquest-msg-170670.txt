On a small raid in POI yesterday, a Spectral Parchment dropped.
After some discussion, we decided to follow an old guild policy,
stating that only people who could scribe the spell could roll for
it (small raid = random, 18 plus on raid = bids)

I didn't win.. but there were quite a few people at 62.9999 and 100%
on AA, because they too saw no use for being 63 with no spells.

Funny

(I have a 63 root, a 64 AE nuke, and a 65 Lull... all gotten because
they are 61-62 for other classes)
