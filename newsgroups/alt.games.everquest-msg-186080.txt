Yeah!  I went on my first Vox raid (an open raid) a few days ago.  It
seemed to take forever to organize and we even wiped (I've never seen
so many dead bodies in a room before).  But it was FUN and EXCITING. 
Heck, the preliminary battle with a bunch of Ice Giants was also way
cool.

Those losing interest, need to spice up their characters life - BANG!
