Very.  My main has always had tracking (I was a druid before I was a
ranger), though, so I don't now how easy it would be to live without it.

Significantly more useful, yes.  Does that difference outweight every
other factor in the classes...probably not.

Honestly, I never used it extensively at low levels, other than
pulling.  Infact, I still hardly use it.  A different ranger would be
better at answering this. :)

If you don't mind compromising your principles and fear-kiting, I know it
can be very practical (though I understand it starts to get tricky around
55...I wouldn't know, I tended to avoid fearkiting...except on snow
cougars, because they are EVIL).  There are other ways to solo, of course,
bow kiting being one of them.
