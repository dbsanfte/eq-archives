In my chosen field I produce a far superior product thank you. In fact
you have probably benefited in someway from it as it resides deep in
the US industrial base. Unless of course you think only games are
important in which case no I don't produce games. As for solutions to
the majority of problems in EQ that's easy... LEAVE THE DAMN GAME
ALONE. See they never asked us if we wanted them constantly screwing
with things, that wasn't an item on the survey.
