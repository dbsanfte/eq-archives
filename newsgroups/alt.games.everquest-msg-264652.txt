Yeah I noticed a whole bunch of my posts scattered back over several 
weeks all got sent around the same time just recently; not sure what 
that means.  The Net is still more art than science, I suppose.

Well I haven't quit... except that I haven't logged on at all in over a 
month, and I notice I don't have any actual desire to do so at the moment.

I guess the difference between "not playing at the moment" and "quit" is 
when I stop paying for the account, instead of just not logging on.

Of course, as we know, they don't actually wipe accounts, so I could 
stop paying for a year and still log back on the next day... recidivism!

Yeah, you, get outta here and take your FAQ wit ya!  Stop spending all 
our bandwith on intelligent readable commentary, we were hoping for a 
higher noise to signal ratio when we heard you pulled the plug.

Would be a couple months sooner than usual, if we get the go ahead to 
tear down a building and put up a new one.  Just got thru with this 
year's business yesterday, I'd appreciate my usual 3 months of slow work 
days and down time... but I might be spending 16 hour days doing 
constructovore instead.  That will also mean more than 6 months away 
from the house... if you think paying $13 a month for an EQ account I'm 
not using is silly, imagine how paying mortgage payments on a house 
thats sitting empty more than half the year feels!  When it was only 3 
months it wasn't so bad, but this is getting out of hand.
