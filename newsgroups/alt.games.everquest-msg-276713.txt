If you are soloing your rogue/warrior/etc and are sitting for 10 minutes 
to regain full health between each kill then logging out for an hour 
between each kill is not going to "skyrocket your xp while minimizing 
your downtime"

Most players will welcome it from the simple perspective of, "I logged 
out immediately after an ldon that ran a little late, and the next day 
when I log in I won't have to spend my first 15 minutes medding.

There is a potential for abuse with respect to players who get into a 
bad situation, are running low health/mana, and then AE mez/root and 
camp out, wait an hour and then camp in ready to take on the fight... 
but these people always had the much more efficient "gate" at their 
disposal.. so its not a big deal.
