answer to a couple of your ?'s

#3 - in a group, most likely you are going to be the healer (or backup
healer), buffer (if no shaman) or caster (if no wizard).  You should not be
engaging in melee, although at 11 you could still get away with it somewhat.

#4 SAve your skill points.  Don't put them into weapon skills - you aren't a
melee type, and don't really need them (unless you're a soloing type).  SAVE
them for when you can specialize (dump as many as you can into the
specialization of your choice).  Trade skills are fine, but make sure you
have at least 35 when you go for specialization.

5 - at 11, try N Ro dervish camps. at 14, 15ish go to Oasis, at 17-18 head
over LOIO.
