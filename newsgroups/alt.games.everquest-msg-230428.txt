Shaman do not get Companion Spirit (the first summoned pet for the 
class) until level 34.

At 29 you have Befriend Animal, which is a charm spell that works only 
on animals no higher than... level 20?  Something like that.  I found 
the charmed pet plan tricky to use at best, the pet's low level meant he 
couldn't reliably tank down mobs I was trying to kill for exp, and the 
spell's short duration combined with my lack of a snare meant I ended up 
spending more time running from my pet plus prey than I did fighting.

The 34 pet is not necessarily what you are dreaming of either; he's 
relatively wimpy, more like a SK's pet than like a beastlord's.  Buffed 
up by you he'll do decent enough damage, but won't enable you to sit on 
your butt and watch the fight go by unless you are farming low blues or 
greens.... or unless you can arrange to have a friendly cleric drop by 
and cast Virtue on him.  Funny thing, pets don't have level restrictions 
the way PC's do, you can get him a full line of level 65 buffs if you 
can afford to convince people to come do it for you.

At any rate, your pet is better suited to helping you kill things 
yourself or helping a group kill things than he is to actually doing the 
work himself while you sit back and heal; think of him as a level 24 
monk or something; decent enough damage if you can get him positioned 
behind the mob, but let the mob beat on someone else, or on you if it 
comes to that.

Every level your pet becomes more and more effective, although IMO it 
never becomes a worthwhile idea to let him tank for you, at least not up 
to 52 which is as high as I got  my shaman.  But his damage output 
becomes more and more appreciable, in part because your melee buffs 
become more and more powerful; haste and strength are very worthwhile.

A story I like to tell: at 49 I was hunting in City of Mist working on 
epic drops.  At one point two identicle skellies jumped me; I sicced my 
pet on one, I took the other.  Slowed both, melee'd mine.  Pet killed 
his and came over to finish mine off... I had only done 25% damage to my 
mob when he showed up!  On the other hand, pet was at less than 20% hp 
remaining while I was at over 80%... and I hadn't even healed myself yet.

 From that point on, I stopped doing melee damage altogether, and 
instead would stand in front of my target, letting it beat on me, while 
I kept myself in Stoicism (a heal over time spell that also slows its 
target, reducing melee output... which would matter if I was trying to 
melee), with my pet behind the mob, which meant it did about 15% more 
damage than standing in front.

At 34 you won't see results like that; your own melee damage should 
still be pretty good, and your pet's melee damage won't be all that 
impressive yet, plus you won't have Stoicism for another 10 levels... 
but the overall idea is still sound; the pet is best used hitting a mob 
from behind while someone else keeps the mob's attention and absorbs the 
majority of the damage.
