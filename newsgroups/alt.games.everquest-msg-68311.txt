Don't bother.  VR may be supported but I'm pretty sure that MS is using
Dragon NaturallySpeaking code, and both EQ and DNS are real memory pigs.
Add the two together and you get something that's useless unless just
traveling.

It was a great idea, I just wish it worked.  I understand there's some other
VR software that might work better due to very low memory requirements, but
don't get your hopes up...especially not until they get all the Luclin bugs
ironed out.
