I'm expecting EQ next week or so to arrivwe, and I'd like to solo a 
character, zince I don;t always have the time to find a group.

I'm in doubt of going druid, or going Necro......

A druid is quite nice and is well liked, but a Necro does sound appealing 
as well, since his dark arts and pet sound affully good...

Main thing against the necro is his disposition with every other race in 
the game.

Now I've seen some "bad" characters like trolls and ogres walk through 
Qeynos and Freeport, since they raised faction with the guards there. Is 
this possible or necro's as well, or will the ystill be KOS'ed due to their 
beliefs ??

Thanks in advance,

Khalistro
