In the Abysmal Sea, I was tradeskilling in baking discovering I had no
brewing skill (butter sauce) so did the brew quest up to 54 (didn't
finish it, but will) then did Fetid Essence to 122 (what does this
have to do with fishing? I am getting to it) and had a stack of
fishing grubs leftover. Decided to go fishing.

I tried all four sides of the boat landing and got the land shark
comment. I tried off the main deck but got the land shark comment
(expected that). Levitated and went to one of the bouys around the
ship, stood on the edge, and stil got the land shark comment.

Back at the boat landing, walked down the ramp that leads into the
water, inching closer to the water, and kept getting the land shark
comment.

Nowhere in the Abysmal Sea could I do any fishing.

Farstoned to Nedarias and found I could fish off the docks getting
fresh fish,  Thunder Salmon, and the usual trash.

Farstoned to Natimbi, after looking around a bit, walked onto a
structure protruding into the water and was able to fish, probably
could have fished from the shore too. This location yielded saltwater
crab and tuna.
