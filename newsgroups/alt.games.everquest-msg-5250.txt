I think it's a matter of roleplaying choice. You have already seen (and will
doubtless see more) of the monks telling you about the wonderful 1HB weapons
out there.  And they are right. Some of those weapons rock. My monk, however,
is level 24 and has never held a weapon. My 1HB skill is "one".  My
hand-2-hand is maxed. Currently have Wu's but working on getting my first set
of fists.  And that's not becasue 1HB weapons aren't really high damage.
It's just not what I see my monk doing for battle, and still acting like "a
monk".  (Please note, I specified "my monk". Not dictating what's "right" for
other monks to do.)  I simply just don't picture monks with dual huge ole'
sticks in their hands, or baton, etc.
  Do what feels/looks/sounds right for you.  But keep that hand-2-hand skill
up, even if you do go with 1HB for a while. I'm told at the highest levels
you'll greatly appreciate it.
