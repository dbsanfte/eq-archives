I like it in theory.

However, the buff ends when the group disbands, too many issues if it 
doesn't... come to think of it I actually suggested something along the 
same lines as a solution to KEI whoring as a result of KEIs high 
duration. KEI still lasts long, even longer, but the enchanter casts it 
once, everyone in the group kets it, and keeps it for as long as they're 
grouped with the chanter and for 25 minutes afterwards (in case of an LD 
or something... KEI is still sweet, and with a 25 minute timer on 
non-group members its still viable in raid situations... its just not a 
PL buff anymore.

One issue is that with good mana regen items and buffs, the mana pool 
drop hurts far more than recasting periodically... so in effect the 
better you are regen geared the less useful this casting method is; so 
its really only suited to be an 'alternative way of casting' very short 
duration buffs (say damage shields) where the hassle of recasting is 
very frequent (especially if it requires swapping spells).

And that's how I'd implement it... as an AA casting 'option' so the 
caster could select when it made sense to use this technique.
