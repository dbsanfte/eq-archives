As I think about it more, some thoughts come to mind.
1 -- Saying feign death unfair is like saying disarm is unfair.  This is one
of the main class skills of a Monk and it is just left in the dust.
2-- If a monk makes a successful feign then the attacker(s) who fail lose
him as a target.  Like what happens when you defeat a mob.  Granted they
could retarget quickly.  This would be a simple addition that wouldn't make
it to powerful, but at least it would bo something.  With the right timing a
good spell failure.

I would like to something like the messages like you get when you try and
cast on a corpse untill the Monk stops feigning.
Some spells a corpse is a legal target I think.

Don't be silly and try and med, for the instant a Monk saw you sit they'd up
and on the attack again.

Feigning wouldn't always be helpful.  I can think of a few stituations that
it could and does cause problems.

I like would like to use it if I get snared/rooted.  A Monk couldn't break
free of the root any faster, but he wouldn't be the target of an onslought
of spells, to which the only defense is to toss a well timed ranged weapon.
(It does work).

I just think that having feign death having no effect is a sign of bad
coding.  Something should happen.
