    I have played a necro up to the mid twenties.  I didn't hate it, but I
just knew it wasn't for me.  I don't know why, and I can't explain it, but
I've always been much more comfortable with wisdom casters than any thing
else.  It is a good suggestion, but the idea of playing a necro simply
doesn't do much for me.
