Play Legend of the Green Dragon online.  Talk about a mean creature.  You
play against creatures of all kinds but the biggest monster in the game is
you.  You also battle each other.

This is an online game that is a remake of the most successful BBS Game in
History.  All you need is your browser to play.

And it's free for all.

Get in there and kill something.  Oh, and don't forget to kill each other as
well(grin)
