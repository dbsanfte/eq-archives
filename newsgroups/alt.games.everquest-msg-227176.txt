All my alts are women, only my main is allowed to be a male. I actually
played a female charactor first but that was about 4-5 years ago for a year.
Back then people did treat me differently its true but no one really just up
and gave me stuff for having breasts. Then I played my current main, a male,
for three years. Recently I started playing my female alts more because of
boredom and people dont really treat me any different than if I was playing
a male. As for my interaction with other "female" charactors I dont treat
them any different and IMO its "dont ask dont tell" if someones toon in EQ
is a female then its a female toon and who cares if its a guy IRL.
