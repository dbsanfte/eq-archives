That's going to happen when the people who play the most are usually the
people who hit zones first and make Verant realize that they need to change
balance up a little. It's the way things work. I'm not sure there is another
way to do it. Something that they consider unbalanced comes up after an uber
guild disovers it and they're supposed to just let it slide til everyone can
take advantage because that would be the fair thing to do? That's absurd.
