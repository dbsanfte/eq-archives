Bash will go up on it's own just from using it. He can use bash every
fight unless he's using a 2Hander. The 1H Slash or 1H Blunt or
Piercing skills that go with using a shield are tougher to keep maxed.
Because a character doesn't usually have 5 equally good weapons
(piercer, 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs), I'd use training points to keep those
unused weapon skills up.
