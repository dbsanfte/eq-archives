Heh, the funny thing about your comment is that the difference between
a well played Druid or Ranger and a clueless one in a place like MM is
huge.  Easily the difference between a great session and a frustrating
series of trains to the zone with CRs for those who didn't make it.
MM was one of the places where Druids learned about heal agro, and it
was usually a painful lesson.  And Rangers learned that there was more
to pulling than just a quick cast of Harmony and an arrow into your
mob of choice, a lesson reinforced with great enthusiasm by the ensuing
train, usually supplemented by a few choice comments from the Ranger's
groupmates.  And, of course, there was the occassional slow learner who
got to MM without having established a habit of Snaring mobs to prevent
them running.
