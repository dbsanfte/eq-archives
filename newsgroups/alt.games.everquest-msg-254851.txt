I was told the Giant Spiders are the place holders for the mammoth and
the Large Wooly Spiders are place holders for the mammoth calves.
Both kinds of spiders can drop spider silks, so I killed them too.   

There are about 9 static spawn spiders in the south that don't seem to
drop silks but they are the same level as the mammoth. My ranger would
exp on them if the mammoth hunting grounds were too crowded.
