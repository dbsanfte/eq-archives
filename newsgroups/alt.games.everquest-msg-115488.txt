	Those two are one and the same.

	There are no Halflings in the Dragonlance series.

	I didn't -- EQ's creators did.

|No, all three (Halfling, Human, and Wood-Elf). You could argue just as
|strongly that Halflings should have had Rangers from day 1 of EQ's
|launch.

	Um, first off, you can't list Halflings there 'coz they are the point of
contention.

	Second off, you could argue just as strongly that they should have had
Space Marines from day 1 of EQ's launch.

|According to you. Verant has written them into the world of Norrath.
|You know, the world they create and control.

	That doesn't mean that anything they do is right.  Only the pope gets to
speak _ex cathedra_, and he's not on Verant's payroll.

	They could "write into the world of Norrath" Troll Bards, too.  How about
Ogre Wizards?  These combinations make as much sense as the Halfling hybrids.

|Iksar and Vah Shir did
|not exist when EQ launched. I don't see you bitching about them being
|added.

	The Iksar existed in their own little bubble prior to the RoK expansion,
so there wasn't much to complain about -- unless you were a Human Monk, who
were not exactly thrilled to see a new race with much better stats added to
the class.

	The Vah Shir did exist when EQ was launched, as the Kerrans.  My only
complaint with them was that the way they were moved to Luclin was a) a
blatant rewrite of history and b) completely stupid and unnecessary -- the
simplest solution would simply to have created a tribe of Kerrans that went to
Luclin with the Loyalists as part of the Combine Empire.  The Erudite pogrom
wasn't due for centuries later.

|The halflings in DragonLance are NOT Tolkein "ripoffs".

	There are still no Halflings in Dragonlance.  That's WHY they are not
"Tolkein ripoffs".

|The D&D halflings are not either, if you are familiar with the game system
|and lore.

	I am, and they are.

|But your whole argument is based on the fact that there Tolkein
|Hobbits could never be Rangers due to temperment. That same temperment
|(as described in the books) would also be contrary to a thief
|class/profession,

	It would not.  All urbanized cultures have thieves.  (The Shire got
decadent in a hurry at the end of the trilogy, too.)

|as well as a Druid priest class that travels the
|world on the wings of magic.

	Again, all cultures (period) have priests.  The fact that priest classes
get magic in EQ is a difference between the worlds, not a difference between
the races.

|You cannot have it both ways. If you
|accept ANY of the Halfling classes in EQ (which are all contrary to
|Tolkein in some respect) you have to accept Rangers. 

	I damned sure can.  All urbanized cultures have a professional soldier or
peacekeeper class.  All urbanized cultures have thieves.  All cultures of any
type have some kind of priest.  There's your Warriors, Rogues, Clerics and
Druids.

	NOT all cultures develop Rangers.  Rangers are a specialized type of troop
meant for particular types of missions, and if you don't have a need for them
you won't go to the expense of developing the infrastructure needed to train
and maintain them.  Rivervale doesn't need Rangers.

|You cannot have it both ways. Magic is an issue here. You have a rabid
|dislike for Halfling Rangers, because they are "contrary" to Tolkein's
|work, yet you then go on to cast aside the MOST significant difference
|between the two worlds? I am sorry, but that doesn't wash. You cannot
|pick and choose your differences (Halfling Temperment= No
|Rangers.....Magic is a non-issue). Your whole argument falls apart
|when you do this

	If we are going to have a world with Halflings, in which priests get
magic, and we accept that all cultures have some kind of priest, then you're
going to get Halfling priest classes that use magic.  It's a non-issue.

	If they start rolling out Halfling Necromancers, now you'd have a point.
In fact, you'd have my point: they don't make sense.

|Where has EQ deviated from their own stereotype for the Halfling Race?
|From day 1 Halflings in EQ have been
|fighters/healers/adventurers/explorers (War/Dru/Clr/Rog). Rangers fit
|the EQ stereotype of the Halfling race perfectly. 

	I would hesitate to classify any Halfling class as an "explorer".  Their
Rogues are criminals, not scouts; they run a gang out of a bar and work
rackets.  They did not have a scout type (either Rogue or Ranger) at start
because they did not (and still do not) need one.  Their territory is
completely surrounded (by Humans, mostly, with the Goblins on one side); they
are effectively a protectorate of the Bayle empire with no frontiers and no
border in need of protection other than the Wall.

|Now we see the real problem. Halfling Rangers make perfect sense in
|the world of Norrath.

	No, they don't make perfect sense.  They don't make sense at all.  They're
major fiction-breakers.  There is simply no reason for a race with that
physique, that temperment, that culture and that situation to field that type
of troop.
