I asked this question at eqtraders and got no reply so I'll ask again here.
In the past the success rate has been reported to be SKILL - (TRIVIAL*0.75)
+51.5 up to some high and low boundaries.  Did the change to success rate at
skill much higher than trivial change the general formula for skill a little
less than trivial level?
