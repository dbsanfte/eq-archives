Background: We just finished clearing VT for the first time. The named 
in there, including the boss mob, Aten Ha Ra, have an annoying AOE 
called "Fling" (pretty much the same as Gravity Flux which many other 
mobs have.) But it's about unresistable.

Many raid leaders love posting pics of their raid force standing in 
victory over the corpse of the boss mob. Ours, sadly, has a bit more of 
a sense of humor.

I have to say, clearing this zone takes frigging forever. But the 
rewards are well worth it.

I will succumb to a bit of virtual dickwaving and note that I even got a 
nice drop myself. In fact, the best thing I've ever gotten in this game, 
being decidedly non-uber myself.

I must say.... woo hoo indeed.
