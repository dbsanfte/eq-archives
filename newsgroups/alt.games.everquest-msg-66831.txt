Forgive me please if this has been answered here before.

Successively pressing <F10> will cycle through three different
game displays.  One is full-screen with various buttons and bits
of information around the edge.  When I choose that view, I do
not see the text which scrolls by, as I do when I use the display
arrangement that is not full-screen.

I have to imagine this is configurable.  Is there an in-game
command which will toggle this?  Is there a change I can make
to the ini file?  I'm being lazy and not hunting in there myself,
as guests are arriving momentarily.

Thanks in advance for the help.
