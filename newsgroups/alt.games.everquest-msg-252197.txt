Every zone has an xp modifier.  That modifier essentially affects how much
XP a mob kill gives you.

For example, assume every 40th level mob gives 100xp.  In a good zone with
a high modifier you might get 210xp for that mob, in a zone with a negative
modifier, you might get 80xp.  In a normal zone you would get the 100xp.

The Hot Spots are zones which just have high modifiers.  Which means
they're better xp on a kill by kill basis than the same level mobs in other
zones.

It has no relation to the level of the character.  The recommended level
ranges are merely the ones Sony think work best in those zones.

In the past, Sony didn't announce which zones had high ZEM's (Zone
Experience Modifiers), but they've done so with the LoY zones to get people
to play in them - since they used to be deserted.

So, recommended level = just some numbers Sony thinks you need to be to
survive and get ok XP in those zones, Hot spots = zones with high ZEM's.
The two aren't related at any level, other than at the moment, they happen
to be the same zones.
