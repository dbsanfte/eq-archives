Fuzzlecutter 5000 is available from Ping Fuzzlecutter in the newbie
hunting grounds in West Freeport.  This is the longest lasting
purchaseable drink I have found, a stack will last as long as
a stack of Fish Rolls.  There is a drink that lasts just as long,
I forget the name, but its a forage in Steamfont, so its hardly
a plan.
