    So you're saying the backup healers knew you were going down AND timed
their backup small heals to land between the last CH and the next one? We do
BP with about a 4 second CH rotation if I remember this weekend correctly.
So the backup healer is either spamming like mad, hoping to get lucky, or he
sees a blown CH and waits one second after seeing it's blown to cast so that
it lands at the right time? And here I thought most backup healers were
trained to just cast if they see a missed rotation cast!

    You mean 3300 damage proc, right? ;-) On an AoW flurry, a small heal
will NOT help. Our CH interval is somewhere in the 2-3 second range, so
after a flurry the maximum time before a CH lands should be 3 seconds. The
casting time on Nature's Touch is 5.5 seconds. If the druid in question
wasn't spamming NT at random, they will not land it after a flurry and
before a CH lands. If they're spamming at random, then why not have a bot
cleric there instead to spam CH or DL?

    Now, we have yet to finish off Emperor yet so maybe our Emperor strat
for the 3300 damage proc is off - we last got him to 60% before a bard in
the main tank's group accidentally hit DA song and wiped us all. =(  But we
have healers whose sole job is to watch for the "Emperor begins to cast a
spell" message and cover CH at that time. Not cover NT. So far we haven't
lost a single engagement to unforeseen death from the proc - we've been
messed up by bad placement when we were deciding where to place him, by bard
DA song, by an amazingly early stun proc before the main tank could use his
stun poo, and by a LD in the offtank group that lead to a loose offtank mob
amongst the CH clerics, but never the proc. Hey, maybe that'll be the next
thing to kill us! =/

    Giving druids CE-like spells would actually be pretty limiting. They
don't stack, unlike direct heals, so their ability to unbalance things would
be limited. At best you're looking at (assuming they get a CE-clone) 300
damage healed every six seconds for the length of a fight on a main tank -
and with the heals they get now, and mod rods, I bet a druid could already
keep that up for the length of an encounter. Where it would have a
pronounced effect would be places like XP grouping, with both high end
players and low-end level 60's, and in "niche roles" like mod healing and
counter-AoE work on raids.

    Well, I'm sure the necromancers aren't happy at being sent to the
basement - or, at least aren't happy until they see everyone else get wiped.

    If we had enough WARs and CLRs, they'd replace the offtanks and offtank
healers. You just run into a numbers issue.
