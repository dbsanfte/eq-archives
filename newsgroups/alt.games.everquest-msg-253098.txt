Yeah, I know the feeling. I have an account still current and I keep it
patched regularly. Every time I log in I'm still sitting there in Kod'Taz
and I go through a similar routine:

a) I remember how plain and utilititarian the graphics are;
b) I remember how smooth and fluid the controls are. I glide around and
strafe circle just to get that feeling back.
c) I say hi to any of my old guild members or friends online and get into
some chat ;
d) and then I log and go play CoH. ;-)
