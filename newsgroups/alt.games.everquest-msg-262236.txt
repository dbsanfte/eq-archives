Really it comes down to the definition of "charm". In my opinion when 
you are charmed you are *charmed*, and by definition of the word, the 
player has been convinced the charmer is a very good friend, a good 
friend with good ideas and whose suggestions are likely good ideas too. 
That is all.

Thus it would be poor RP to deliberately resist them or make witty 
literal interpretations of straightforward suggestions. Is that how your 
character acts around your 'real' friends?

On the other hand, if you take charmed to be some form of "Possession" 
where an entity forceably takes control of your body then sure RP player 
resistance all you want. But being possessed by a monster is not the 
same semantics as being charmed by one -- in most games.

For example, DnD charm, clearly aligns itself with the former 
definition. cite:

In fact, the above link is very good description of how charm works in 
most tabletop games.
