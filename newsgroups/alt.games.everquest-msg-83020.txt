No one said it suprising, was just stating a fact.  And yes it has
everything to do with a GM liking or not liking, it all depends on how the
GM interpets the name in question, whether its a violation or not.
Otherwise, there wouldn't be level 50+ people with names that seem
unappropriate to you and me.  Some names are obviously more likely to get
nailed than others, like my friend's name, for example.  And actually, maybe
you are right, there was a suprise... that it took them 2 weeks before they
got him, and the fact that it was able to get by their name filter.
