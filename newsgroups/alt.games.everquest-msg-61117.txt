Too bad. I could have pulled out my ACT scores, which were high enough
to cause Harvard to send me an invitation, but apparently not high
enough for them to offer to cover the tuition.

Astoundingly, at the time I took the ACT I received the highest score
in the history of my school. And some wet-behind-the-ears Sophomore
blew my composite score away by a coupla points the very next year.
Naturally, I had him whacked.

And here I sit some undisclosed number of years afterwards, and you
know what that ACT score means? Squat, which is only marginally less
than what it meant when I got it, as I knew plenty of people with much
lower scores who went on to perform much better than I in college.

On the plus side, I got a nifty lapel pin and a Presidential Academic
Fitness Award signed by Pres. Reagan (which is all the further I'm
going to narrow down the time frame!), suitable for framing or
wrapping fish. It sure wows them at parties.
