Freeport warrior newbie BP:
AC: +12 Str: +2 Sta: +4 Dex: +1 HP: +5  

Banded bp

ac 15.

Banded is better, for the set. The stats are moderately
inconsequential. But yeah, if you already had the newbie armor, I
guess you'd skip banded and go to bronze plate or fine steel plate.. 
if you were calling buying better gear in the bazaar "twinking."
