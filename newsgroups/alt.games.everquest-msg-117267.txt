My guess would be in Neriak 3rd Gate.  The guards in there are tougher, some
of them are SKs, some are Clerics (with CHeal).  I was taking them on with a
lvl 54 Ranger, 54 Monk, 47 Necro, and me at level 52.  I have a warrior
friend that is 52 that is itching to hit Commons, so, I may be headed back
there yet for a bit.
