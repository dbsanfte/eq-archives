I found that every time any of the executables, patches and everquest
get updated, zonealarm sees them as new programs and stops them in
their tracks.  Very annoying but understandable.  I've taken to just
shutting zonealarm off when playing.  Otherwise it is launch and reset
permisssions on zonealarm and then restart EQ.  I don't know of any
way to make zonealarm ignore the changes since that's really what it
is supposed to do as part of it's protection against bad things
changing your programs.
