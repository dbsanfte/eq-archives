You seem to be making a very good argument *for* my point.

Let me see, utilities (planners) can no longer generate their own power and
power is forced into becoming a traded commodity, subject to the laws of
supply and demand. Seeing as demand is going to increase then what is the
best way for the power generators and brokers to make huge profits?

Yep - restrict supply. Price goes through the roof and the utilities and
consumers are put over the barrel. That is globalisation at work, that is
what your pollies (and ours) are fighting tooth and nail *for* and trying to
convince us that this is what we really need.

If the power company was still just an old fashioned public utility then 30
years ago when they realised they needed more power they would have gone out
and built them and to hell with everyone (greenies included).

Just imagine if the local council who has an obligation to get rid of the
shit from your place was prevented from running sewerage works itself? Now
imagine that disposal of sewerage was made a commodity to be brought and
sold due to supply and demand.... Yep - before you know it 2 bucks a flush
and a chilli bean surcharge.

But of course - that would also be the <greens> fault I guess - not the
pollies for making up a fubar system like that so the companies that fund
their campaigns can reap huge profits?
