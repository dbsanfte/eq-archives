I'm not aware of a way to fix PoG faction? My iksar monk worked heavily on
faction when he was my main and i think i know the quests in erudin you
speak of (nice when you pair with a root-er) but unless something new
developed, there's now way to fix PoG?

Personally i think killing undead should improve cleric factions, or at
least the ones around cities. "you killed our sworn enemies over and over,
whattaguy, even if you are a leezard". After all, it works with the freeport
paladins, why not the clerics?

Alas, the team that cared about faction is long gone, and I guess so too are
the people who started EQ as a roleplaying game. Except for me ;-)
