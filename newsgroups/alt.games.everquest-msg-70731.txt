Fuzzlecutters last at least as long as 2 fish rolls (force ate/drank 
untill full then see when i ate something), and for my druid with 80 cha 
it cost me around 6pp a stack, so most chars should be able to afford it.
You can also get an Enduring Drink from foragig in Qhills (cant remember 
name though), and i think a forage in Steamfont are enduring too (not 
100% sure, only been there a few times, got one once).

At this time you unfortunately cant brew enduring drinks, so well have 
to settle for Fuzzlecutters. I can only say that all my chars apart from 
druid (can forage) always got a stack on them.
