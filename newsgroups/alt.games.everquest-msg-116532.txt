For drops and such, yes.    Even some nice Vendor Trash, at high levels.
(gems and such)  But the VT is too rare to make up for it.    Hill Giants drop
coin that is way out of line with everything else in the game, and especially
thier level.   Up to 40 pp off each giant.   The richest mobs, those in
Sebilis and such places, rarely have more than 6 pp each.  If that.  Other
"blue to 60" hunting places, especially on Luclin, drop no coin at all.   So
any costs such as symbols, etc... are just eaten by the group or the members.
You spend the day hunting, and gain little more than the experience.   Perhaps
one person walking away with a nice or semi-nice drop.

A level 35 giant can be dropped in only a few seconds, with minimal downtime,
and gives an average of 15 pp.  (up to 40, as low as 4)  A level 50 frog in
seb can be dropped in the same time, if you have a group, and gives each group
member about 1 pp.   Where do you think I went when I needed several thousand
pp to finance a Sky Raid...  you bet I was in Rathe Mountains for a while.
