  Some time ago I asked a similar question and Transgaming came up as the
most likely source. Though the general consensus seemed to be "don't hold
your breath".
  Some one with more programming and Linux experience mentioned something
about the way EQ and DX are programmed not playing nicely with Linux (as I
recall something about COM). So even if Transgaming gets SOME games to work
with DX 8/8.1, EQ might not be one of them.
