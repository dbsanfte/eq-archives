Or you could make a deal with yourself:  I am going to create a
new character and play it all by itself.  Take nothing the
character hasn't earned for himself, and use no powers/methods
beyond my new character's innate abilities.    An addendum to
that deal would be to not worry about how fast I can level.  Take
time to enjoy the game -- explore, learn new trades, converse
with people, learn everything there is to know about a city or
other zone, relax -- play the game for the fun of it instead of
turning it into drudgery.
