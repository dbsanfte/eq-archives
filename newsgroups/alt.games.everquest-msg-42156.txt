I have on several occaisions, and sure, it helps.. but is it really the best
epic in the game?  Sad if true, since it generally only gives you the
ability to do something you can already do, all it does is save some
mana.  Mage epic gives them something that noone in the game without
the epic can equal... doesn't just save them the mana of casting a pet.

Five minutes?  How sad, I've spent a lot of time resing passers by while
my group is pulling, and never seen it slow things down at all... I only
do it while FM and with a controlled situation, of course, so the stick
would improve that... Do your friends not have specialize alteration
maxed out?  Its only a few hundred mana most of the time, heck,
costs like one or two good heals or nukes.

Mid combat res... well, ok I guess, but then you have someone under
res effects for the next couple minutes, probably blow mana healing
them, if a caster they are manaless, if a tank, they are unbuffed,
basically a liability unless its one looooong battle.  Handy when you
are facing death touch mobs, of course, since that means more people
that might be TARGET instead of the people you need to kill em.

Which is irrelevant, you won't need to use this, its just another option that lets

you cross areas safely.  Oh, and it doesn't make you KOS in velious per se,
it merely reduces your faction.   Coldain will KOS someone who was Indifferent
if he goes puppy, to be sure, but at amiable he's only reduced to Apprehensive...
and at Ally (can't get any better) I by Brell's Beard -stay- ally in puppy.
