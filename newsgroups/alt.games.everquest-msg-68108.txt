I read a future update text and here is how i thought it would work in game:
First you go to a major vendor area that will now be tagged as a bazaar area
(just like the pvp area in each city). South Qeynos tents, east Cabilis tent
vendor platform, ETC. Enter bazaar mod with that command thingy and tag your
prices on the items you got on you. Then you just stand there like a mofo
and call out you want to sell. They click on you as if you were a npc
vendor, klick on items for prices and press trade for the ones they want to
buy.
My thoughts.
