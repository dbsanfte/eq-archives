Fixing wariors is a lot more complex than adding more exp-reliant
endgame gimicks, especially ones on timers. The more I think about it,
the more the problems seem worse in sub-60/65 raids and exp groups, once
you're playing in a post-nToV arena. 

The problems started mid Velious in nToV. Right from the start of the
game, armor type meant penalties for certain classes. This was
compensated for by other areas. Plate wearers got the benefit of highest
AC and usually most hps. When they brought in the crafted armor level
quests, this was made very apparent how they viewed the relative
itemisation of classes, and the differences between the types of armor
that could be worn.

Kunark continued that, as did the Velious level quest armors. Then it
started to fall apart. nToV added chain+ to most of the higher end
armors, as well as starting on the slippery slope to al/all endgame
items. Luclin blew away any semblance of difference between the inherent
armor restrictions.

The situation now is that the highest end monks (leather class) are
wearing similar items to the highest end warriors in the vast majority
of slots. That means that the gap of ac/hps between plate and chain and
leather has been reduced significantly in real terms.

Now, look at the other side of the coin. The balance for ac/hps
(tanking) is damage output (weapons). Better tanks should do less damage
to compensate, and visa-versa.

The problem is, whist the pure damage classes continue to climb in DPS
throughout each expansion, the hybrids also get better ratios and spells
to make up the difference. The endgame warrior is stuck with using 2 out
of 3 weapons in the entire game. These weapons actually do LESS dps than
Velious era weapons (SoD/Jaelens/Kreizen/NevHorn etc.) by virtue of
simlar ratios but the total removal of any damaging proc.

The net result of these curves in tandem, is that a warrior's relative %
advantage in terms of AC and HP has diminished steadily from post-nToV
Velious, and at the same time his penalisation in terms of damage output
difference, and grown and grown.

Taunt, on the other hand, is somewhat of a red herring. It doesn't work
properly, but players have found ways to adapt to that on raids.
Enhancing basic taunt in the exp arena, would make tanking on raids even
more trivial than it already is. Adding endgame gimicks like EB weapons
or 50AA abilities helps on raids, but does nothing for non-raids, where
you're less likely to have a disciplined force, or the tools (enc/sk
buffs) to manage agro.
