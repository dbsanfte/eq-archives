If you can take the obnoxious shout/ooc channel back and forth that comes
with hanging out in a coveted xp zone, then HighHold Keep (or whatever it's
official name is) is a great place to be.  The xp bonus is so huge that you
can get great experience even with a full group.  25 is an awesome level to
be there and healers are usually in high demand.
