The phrase "simultaneiously" is, I believe, the key here. (Though if
Brad's still reading here, I'm sure he could clarify.)  Given there are
forty two or so servers, and the average server population during
popular play times runs in the 2K to 2500 range, I'd say that 90K online
at any given time is probably a fair estimate.  Total subscription is
still, I believe, being stated as the mid 400K range.
