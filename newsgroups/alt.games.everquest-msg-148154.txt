I have a great sense of humor, actually. As a matter of fact, I was
ribbing YOU with the Turtle Skin comment. I was merely questioning the
extent of the "bludgeoning" you may have received. Doesn't matter
though. I was posting more to add my 2cp on whether the change would
be a good idea or not.

I suppose we should say it though...all together now..."You were
right, Crash, you clairvoyant little dickens, you. We are all so not
worthy."

Oh, and I really don't need to see the original post. I believe you.
Really.
