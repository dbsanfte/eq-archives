Subject: Severs UP? - Complaint

Whilst I appreciate that EQ has improved in many ways. Basic customer servicing
still seems an alien concept. On the original game log in it was easy upon
logging in to see the server status,  how many players were on line and which
were the recomended servers for new players to join. 

Now if one wants to see the server status you have to log into the main EQ
site.  For two hours now this site has been showing all servers up ecxcept the
test server and yet it is impossible to log into the game! Yes, I know it was a
patch day but the patch seemed to have finished a while ago. Why show the
servers as all being up if that is not the case?
