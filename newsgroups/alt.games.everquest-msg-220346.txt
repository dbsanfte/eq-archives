Hiya, 

   I'm working on bringing a ranger of mine out of retirement, gearing
him up and playing him those times when I need a break from my main.
Gear seens to be coming along ok, although I know I could use a decent
haste item. Just can't justify spending the money on one atm when I
could solo a 31% haste item in a few hours (if I can find the time and
handle the tedium of a boring solo camp). 

Magelo is below but I'm not really looking for advice on normal
upgrades (although I certainly wouldn't mind any advice in that area
<g>), mainly I'm wondering if there are any must-have items that I'm
missing, things that no ranger should be without.

One thing I am wondering is what would be really nice DPS weapon(s) at
that level. The 2-hander I'm currently using seems decent enough and I
also have a choice of Longsword of Ethereal Energy, defenders
lightblade and that ranger axe that drops in LDoN (MM) dor dual
wielding. No dual wield setup that I have seems to beat the DPS of the
shadowflame though and you really can't beat the price since it's a
free weapon <g>. Any suggestions for higher DPS weapons that are
buyable for under 10k? 

I also have some questions about the epic. Just skimming the
walkthrough, it seems that swiftwind should be pretty easy to get
except for the PoSky part. For some reason, I've never been to Sky but
from what I've heard it's a pain to move around in. I hate to impose
on friends just to gear up an alt so unless it's a quick trip I don't
see me ever getting even that part of the epic. The rest doesn't seem
to be difficult and while I don't mind calling in a few friends for a
quick kill of something like VSR I don't assume that's the case with
Sky. 

Anyone have any good suggestions for those times I want to solo. I'm
not a big fan of fear kiting animals, too boring, so I'm partial to
soloable dungeons where I can harmony pull to split mobs. The revamped
CoM is my current zone for those times when none of my friends are
online but I'd like a change of pace occasionally if anyone has any
ideas. 

Thanks in advance for any help, 

Rgds, Frank
