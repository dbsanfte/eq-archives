My rogues don't need CHeal if they can just 'port somewhere to Quad
Assassinate mobs if they get stuck down in the bottom of Chardok
and go LD, only to get back on with the raid gone...

Soloing is NOT the be-all-end-all of the game.  However it's EXTREMELY
nice to have the OPPORTUNITY to IF you can't find a pick up group in
some dungeon or if you just have a short time on to play that day.

The ability to solo effectively (extremely better gear on my alt rogue
at 55 than my main had at 55) has made a HUGE difference in the
alt's EQ playing style...killing certain mobs for an hour sure beats
sitting at the zone in in Sebilis away from the 2 see-invis shaman
froggies shouting LFG for an hour...
