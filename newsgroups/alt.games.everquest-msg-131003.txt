Bastard.  Someday, maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll be able to say that too.  
Sigh.

Although I don't think it necessarily needs to match your personal 
experience for you to relate, or at least understand it.

}I simply maintain that no one's actions "control" anyone elses
}actions.

Y'all don't know many dominatrixes, do ya? :)

}To allow that possibility would naturally lead to the idea that there
}is a god..

Hrm.  I'd think very much the opposite.  At least, the Christian God is 
all about holding people accountable for their actions.  If people could 
be absolutely "controlled", assigning resposibility woud be a much harder 
puzzle.

}And, of course, that is pure fantasy...  :^)

Well, I dunno about that.  It sure isn't -my- fantasy... :)
