It sounds like you need to do some creative cutting.  Is this the 
situation:

1) The new card fits in the slot ( or it would if the case structure would 
allow it )
2) The connector on the new card for your monitor is on the -inside- of the 
case, with no exposure to the outside.

If these are true, you may be able to get out a drill / dremel / etc and 
cut your case to allow the card to seat correctly and the monitor cable to 
reach the normal SVGA out on your new card.
