	The problem is that there are working quests that follow that kind of
pattern.
	
	Frinstance, an Iksar Monk quest that gives a hint towards the Monk epic
has its NPC tell you that there is no such place as the Lost Valley.  Only
there is; it's where the portals are in DL.

	It doesn't help either that if you go to the guy (Treekill) and talk to
him, he offers to reward you if you bring him a Burynai Bundt Cake.  Someone
trying to solve this had to consider the possibility that there is such a
thing as a Burynai Bundt Cake and Glinya just didn't know it.
