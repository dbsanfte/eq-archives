Servers with Zek in the name are usually player-versus-player.  I'd 
suggest avoiding them until you are familiar with the game.  The Firiona 
Vie server is a roleplay server where you can only create one character 
at a time.  Again, you may want to start elsewhere if you're a newbie. 
There are some european servers, you may want to pick one of them if 
you're in Europe.

Most of the rest are standard servers all located in the same place. 
(I'm sure someone here will correct me if I'm forgetting anything 
important.)  They were started at different times and some were split 
servers containing a large population of characters from an older 
server, but otherwise there's not much difference between them.  I'd 
suggest doing some reading online to see if the population of a 
particular server has anything you object to.  For example some servers 
have very large guilds that dominate high level play.  The Cazic-Thule 
server has a number of guilds with long histories that formed in other 
games before Everquest, so the server has a larger than usual population 
of experienced gamers.  If you have seen the Brell Rants boards, you may 
get the impression that the number of con artists on the Brell server is 
higher than average.  Other servers may have other pecularities that 
people here can tell you about.

It is possible to have an enjoyable time solo, depending on your 
character's class and how you play the game.  You can certainly get a 
character to level 5 or so without grouping, but most people group most 
of the time, at least at higher levels.

Lots.  To start with, it's ok to ask people for information, but begging 
for money, items, and help with long quests is considered very bad form. 
  As you start to group, you will find that your ignorance can get 
others killed, so unless you have done a lot of reading online you may 
want to admit that you're just getting started, or proceed a bit 
cautiously.  You can learn a lot from watching others.

Get more RAM.  128 MB will get eaten up before you even get in game. 
Different parts of the world will give different performance, so if you 
have trouble in Katta for example, try Freeport or Felwithe instead.  Be 
sure to check the options settings and try turning stuff off to save CPU 
cycles if necessary.

You've probably seen most of the information sites already, but here are 
some:
