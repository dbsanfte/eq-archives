Isn't any less a possibility of being a place holder then any of the
other things mentioned.

Whenever I read a post that lists the placeholder as "kill
everything"; I interpret that to mean, "I don't know put kill
everything and with luck, one will be the placeholder."

This is the same philosophy in Sro when hunting the AC. Spent three
levels in Sro and I enjoyed all the theories as to what spawns the AC
right down to the named Sg that appears and means ( according to a
person there) the AC spawn was two hours away, BTW it didn't spawn in
the four hours I played after named appeared. Great place to go at
level 15. Good exp and even better loot as you loot up the level 51
mass killing of MoBs they leave behind in an attempt to get the AC to
spawn. My Necro has a little over 400pp from 3 levels in Sro. :-P
