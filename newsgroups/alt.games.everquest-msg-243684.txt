I was wondering what would be the best choice of weapon for my L11 Cleric.
I have about 20 plat, but I don't really want to spend it all if I don't
have too.
I have right now a:
Chipped Rujarkian Orc Scepter
1H Blunt
Delay 38
DMG 9
Str +2
Dex +4
HP +10

Thanks for the help.  Maybe I am just spoiked with my Pallies weapon, but my
CLE just seems too slow when I solo him.
