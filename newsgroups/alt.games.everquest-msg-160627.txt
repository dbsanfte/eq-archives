As I understand it.(and yes I've been wrong before)  DoTs of the same
Name stack... i.e.    two different players cast Heart Flutter and
they will stack, but two different players casting different spells of
the same upgrade line will not stack.  Only the higher spell will
remain in effect.

again that is as I understood it from the various statements on
Casters realm by Sony employees.
