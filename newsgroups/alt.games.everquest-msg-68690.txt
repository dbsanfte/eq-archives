Well, the version I used was shortly after Velious came out.. so Im sure it
improved immensly from that time.  But, Im still at the stage of "scared to
use it and better safe than sorry."  Now that I know what I need to do to
get it to run in full screen mode.. well.. hrrm.. it is quite tempting
indeed.. but. will I get banned because of it should they ever find out is
the question.  I guess thats something everyone has to determine on their
own.. figuring/deciding just how WORTH it is it to use the program. <shrug>
