They did say (a few weeks ago) that the frequency and power were a
couple of the things they've been working on.  I agree that you
shouldn't die from a trap on a reward for defeating an encounter.  That
would be a good source of irritation, dying by a trap on a chest and by
the time you run back to the chest, have the loot timer wear off so
somebody else grabs it before you get there.
