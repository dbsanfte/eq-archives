I've got Faelin's ring, and need to give it to Giz in Kithicor, however,
he's a dark elf, and I've heard conflicting reports on how to do this.

Giving him the ring spawns A Dark Reaver, that you run from.  However, the
only time I felt like nearly dying to do this, some other druid had *just*
made a dark reaver that was camping the WC zoneline (fortunately he was
sitting at the zone in WC warning people), I gated to Misty and ran out
there, but Giz wasn't up on track, but the rest of the DEs were, so he's on
a spawn timer, but what is it?

Also, since I have to give him the ring, I assume he is NOT KoS by default
to druids/rangers, however, since he's a dark elf, I also assume that he's
near the DE camp, so what's the trick to avoiding them?

For that matter, does wolf form make this part of the epic easier by way of
faction or harder?  (IE make the DE's or Giz KoS or non KoS different from
what wood elf does)

Also, since I have most of the forages and the parts from the corrupted HG
and Mammoth. (and need bank space)

How difficult would it be to get the tainted/corrupted aqua gobbie in Lake
Rathe at 39 or with a 54 druid as backup?

How difficult are the EK reavers/corruptor?  I'm aware that the reavers can
be either pulled away or mezzed, but do they either summon, or resist mez a
lot?  As well as what type of force to kill the corruptor himself, I can get
a 54 monk, 1 or 2 54 druids, myself a 39(probably 40 by the time this would
happen) druid, and possibly a 53 enchanter OR 41(or slightly higher) paladin
(same account)

However nice it would be, I have no misconceptions that it's going to take a
while for me to be able to do VSR, CoM reavers(although my bank account is
growing fast, I *might* be able to purchase a reaver soon, if somebody ever
sold the accursed things) or the cleansed Kunark/Faydwer.

(which invites one more question)
Does the spawned VSR (NOT the real VS) proc the VS lifetap or not?  I've
heard from a ranger who said he didn't and an RL friend mage who said he
did.
