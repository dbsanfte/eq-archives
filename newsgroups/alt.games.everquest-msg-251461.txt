That's a *real* peeve of mine too. Particularly for MS Office.

If MS found a way to stop people from pirating it people would just stop 
using it. Joe average doesn't need a $600+ piece of software to write 
the odd letter, let his kids write their term papers, and do the odd 
budget spreadsheet. OpenOffice is practically identical, especially for 
the basic to intermediate tasks, and is 0.00$.

Hell... if people's hands were actually forced on the issue OO would not 
only gain traction in the home PC, but at the office too. Because once 
IT people learned they didn't actually need MS Office they'd wonder why 
they were spending $100k licensing their businesses on it.

For my clients I generally recommend a small number of MS office copies 
to deal with the odd special situation. And and the rest use OO.

E.g. In situations where personnel get a lot of external (& complicated) 
Office docs we consider licensing them office, but for most people, who 
just deal with internal docs, and simple ones at that... OO is far more 
than adequate. And far more cost effective.

The few advantages office really has only start to show up in Enterprise 
integration e.g. Outlook on an Exchange server, custom Apps written 
against the OfficeSDK etc, and these are really only leveraged by savvy 
Enterprises. But even there, few businesses, even those with exchange 
servers and the the works barely scratch the surface of what they are 
paying to be able to do... so why pay to be able to it?
