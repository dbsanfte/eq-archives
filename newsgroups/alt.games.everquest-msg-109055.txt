Because not everyone in the real world who has the potential to be a
good actor decides to be an actor. In a game where that's almost the
*point*, though, the same situation doesn't apply.

If you have to ask I have to assume you've never had to perform in
front of an audience for anything. It's not something most people
actively seek out to do.

Being shy is a lot rarer when one is anonymous.

Are we done with the 'curious two year old' gimmick now? The anonymity
plus the role playing possibilities allows a much larger percentage of
the population to act in completely different ways.

The number of guys playing female characters is all the proof I need.
(no offense intended to those people, I have some female characters as
well)

Why?
