That use to be true. Not any more, people appreciate what we can do. If
anything, I have trouble finding groups because there are *so* many high
level, unimaginatively named guild twinks waving around their
Freebringers. Just be sure to get your lockpick skill to 201 when your
time comes, and talk and walk fluent d00d to add to your charm.

:feels better.

The cliquiness of the Safehouse is testament to that.
