I don't know what you are complaining about, only last week were the severs
given the world wide message that a weekend of events was to come...and boy
did it ever come, what with skies turning red and Dark Elves in Befallen and
Loads of undead around Qeynos/Karana's. Sheesh what more do you want? I mean
I was so excited I had to log off and go out before I had an accident.
And NOW! We have more messages saying that there will be many strange things
out there, things are not what they seem...and warnings like "Look! What's
that behind you?" Had me very scared I can tell you...I'm not sure I can
take another change in sky colour, I may actually have to stay off for a
while, just until things calm down and return to normal.

Still looking behind me regularly...although all I see atm is telesales.
