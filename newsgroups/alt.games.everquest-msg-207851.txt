Yeah, for some reason, EQ doesn't like laptops.  I take my laptop when I
travel.  Sometimes it works, sometime it doesn't.  It's weird.  I can be
playing and it will crash to desktop, then I try to log back in and crash
every time at splash screen.  I don't try it for several weeks, then it will
work fine.  OBTW...I've tried contacting support before about it, and all I
ever get out of them is "Download a new video card driver", which is totally
useless as I regularly update my video drivers...
