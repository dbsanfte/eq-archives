Oh my.  I don't know what to say...

What makes matters worse is the fact that George W. Bush has been
cutting VA spending, and plans to do it again.  (But he'll manage to
push through yet another tax cut for the wealthy...)

Talk about the Bush administration's priorities being completely out
of whack.  Now I understand why Kerry said he wants to increase VA
spending...  I hope he really means it...

For the first time in my life, I'm glad I'm too old to be drafted.
Yikes...

It's going to be another long, painful 4 years, when George W. Bush is
re-elected.  :(
