to put pionts into smithing cost me 9 copper now :) and thats just from
sharpening the rusties I get fomr the skellies in Nektulos. I dream of a
fully outfited adamantinite (sp?) SK, with his trusy battle ax (16/34 gift
from a verry nice high lev player) or his stalag spear and a killer shield.

   Which reminds me, pierce and 2hs are ruffly at the same ar, I trained 1
pt in bash and went around pounding thins with my kite shield. Bash seems to
make combat "feel" differant but what does it do? I dont see any noticeable
stunn with bash (unless its me getting bashed). I try to bash every skelly I
can, it does about 5 damage when it lands and I never seem to miss with my
spear after landing a bash, is this the desired effect?

Thanks
