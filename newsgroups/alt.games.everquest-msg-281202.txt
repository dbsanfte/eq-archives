I don't know if this is what you are referring to, but my wife (who
was playing EQ2 pretty heavily) said that the latest patch up'ed the
mob levels, which meant that she was forced out of the zones she had
been exploring.  She was pretty bummed about it, and ended up quitting
the game.  She was still leveling fine, but she's an explorer at
heart, and being forced to back up to "known areas" just didn't work
for her.
