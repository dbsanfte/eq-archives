Unless you don't have Velious installed, in which case it doesn't matter,
because hitting I will take you to the inventory mode, but in Half-screen.

And by installed, I mean enabled on your account.  I have Velious installed,
but need to go buy a new CD key for it to enable my new account, and playing
on that account I might as well have another 300 MB of HD space freed up
(well, except that I can see the Velious armour textures, and that a friend
of mine plays on my computer, in Velious, a lot)
