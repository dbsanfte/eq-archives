This one act, this one deed has made me forgive the developers of Everquest
for any grief they may have caused in the past.

To the developer that has done this, let me doff my hat to you in a mark of
admiration. I love you, I truly do. In fact I will bear your babies.

I look forward to the joy of logging in over the next few days and not
constantly be screamed at for KEI by green n00bie bastards.

No Level restriction? be good for PLing n00bie melees

A spell that destroys Karana totally would be good

ROFL: Good for others, I got 402AA anyway, gratz me more inate strength. But
the charm sounds very nice. The charm increases in power depending on how
many flags you have and is different for casters/melee

Hurrah! Might be worth fighting there again, providing can get through the
200 dead bodies and every 5 second trains that will be there after patch.

This could be interesting. Soooo many items that people never really found
use for.

Never did this as Inner Acrylia was a pointless debacle of bugs on top of
bugs. Be interestign to see what the reward is for the pain of that key.

How about a charm that doesn't need to be grouped with members of a masonic

Dagger can't be used by Monks, what is EQ coming to

Slashing weapon can't be used by Monks, what is EQ coming to.

Lot of monk nerfs this week.

K, does this effect the frame rates in a positive manner?
