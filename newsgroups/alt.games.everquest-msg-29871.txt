The Walrii in the SW corner of GD are great XP and it's a nice deserted area
for quadding. They are PH's for Ulthork man-o-wars os you can kill some of
them too for armor and tusks.

I believe the Drolvargs in the NW corner of FV are still blue to you - they
are nice QK fodder too, just pull them to the area around the SoNH zone.
Plenty of room and no drixies or pilgrims to KS you.
