Here's my take on rezzes, as a 54 cleric:

I do not have to rez you. It's a neat spell I have, but I can shove it
in the back of the book if I want to- just like a druid can shove all
their ports in the back of the book and forget about them. It's my mana,
my play time, and I'm going to do whatever I want. Rezzes are not a
right, any more than ports are.

If you realize that ALL clerics will think that way, you're halfway
there. Everyone is a selfish bastard- some of us are just more honest
about it than others.

Standard fees for rezzes: 20pp for revive, 50pp for 50%, and 100pp and
up for 90%. Often 200pp or better for 96% or more, although clicksticks
can often be cheaper. I personally have never paid for a clicky rez, as
the cleric with the stick just happened to be in the right place at the
right time or generously clicking the whole raid.

Obviously, if you're in my group, or on my raid, your rez is free, but I
will hate casting it. I will feel it is my fault you died, and it's the
best apology I can make.

If I am grouped, I am NOT leaving my group to rez you. I don't care if
you're a guildie or my RL husband. (Usually I'm grouped with him, so it
ain't an issue) If I am grouped as an alt, I'm not leaving my group to
change faces and rez you. I sure as hell am not leaving my group to
travel several zones to rez you. Get over it. If your corpse is in the
same zone with me, ASK, and often you can drag your corpse to us, and I
can rez between pulls. I will often ask my group if I can do the rez,
and we can plan a break to do it. I will share funds received with my
group. Sometimes, the rogue or monk will volunteer to pull the corpse.
They definitely deserve a tip or a share of the rez money.

If I am not grouped, and have nothing better to do, I'm delighted to
help a guildie. But only if travel is convenient. Because my computer
hates the moon, I will not travel there. I get migraines due to lag. No
migraine is worth 100pp or even 500pp. If your corpse is in the middle
of Lower Guk (a zone I don't know and is hard to get to with no porter
handy), and you want me to go from the Hole to rez you, and you want me
to drag your corpse to a safe spot too because you're bound in
Thurgadin, I am likely to say no. Odds are pretty good there's already a
cleric in Guk who can help you better than me.

If I am not grouped, and have nothing better to do, I will possibly
accept a stranger's rez request. But - you should provide ports if
needed. I will NOT rez anyone under 30. You can get that XP back faster
than I can travel to your corpse and mem the spell. Lately, I've been
even more parsimonious about under 40. I get more cynical the longer I
play. And I'm not going to rez you because you died to the PoD or in a
duel and the guards aggroed you (I HATE those requests).

If I am not grouped and am busy, I'll probably ignore rez requests,
unless really convenient or for a guildie in a splat level.

If I'm playing my alt, unless it's already a good place to stop, or I'm
not busy, I ain't changing faces to rez. I often play a necro, and while
I'm not grouped, I still have to kill my pet, and will spend time
medding to buff the pet and me after creating a new pet, in addition to
whatever travel/medding time my cleric needs.

Note: I have never, nor will I ever, just sit in place and auction
offering rezzes for Xpp. Perhaps that's a good service in Karnors or
Dreadlands or something. But I have better things to do. And usually,
when I do accept a rez request, I don't charge. I have turned down the
money before, and will likely continue to do that.

Money is NOT a factor for whether I will give a rez. It is always TIME.
My time, and if I want to spend it on you.
