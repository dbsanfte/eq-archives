From the perspective of doing some of the newbie armor quests for a gnome 
wizard, I can say that I would much prefer the ones with more tradable 
items.  It was a royal pain in the butt full of farming greens to get the 
armor, even though I started working on it at level 1.  Teaches you early 
on that you'll need to be farming green mobs to get things you want.
