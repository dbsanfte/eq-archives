Aye, but your efficiency in doing so is irrelevant. In the latter case 
there, the value of your time takes a severe nosedive.

Just as an example, if I were to pay my little brother $10 to farm me 250 
spider silks while I went out for the evening, would that not be the same 
thing? It doesn't sound nearly as wrong in that scenario though.

Again, devil's advocate. I just think this is an interesting topic.
