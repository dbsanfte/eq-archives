That's the best way to do it, although I have also heard that you can
use a ` instead of the ' and you'll be able to type out your warder's
name in the assist message.  That's the symbol on the key with the
tilde.  I've never tryed it, though, since /pet target works just
fine.

Another question, though, is, would you rather have your pet on the
mob you're fighting, or would you rather be on the mob your pet is
fighting?  Right now, you were asking about the latter, but one of the
best hotkeys you can have is for the former.  I hope you already have
one, but if you don't, then

/pet back off
/pause 2
/pet attack

will do wonders.  I have both hotkeys, and I only really use the one
to target what my pet's attacking while soloing.  But I use the one to
have my pet attack what I'm targeting every single battle.  And I
apologize if posting this insults your intelligence, but I'd rather be
safe.  :)

Game on,
