Hi guys and gals,

I'm a level 39 Wood Elf druid with all the important spells and solid 
but not very spectacular equipment (188 wis). I prefer to solo as I have 
other higher characters who do nothing but group (cleric, shadowknight).

Where would be a good spot to fight at my level. I've just recently 
completed (or should I stick to it for another level or two? I'm really 
looking long-term; to my next spell level ideally (44)) my run in the 
Rathe Mountains.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,

Warwick
