I have been looking at doing this series.

One way or the other, I think I'm going to do it, but info on the final
quest appears to be incomplete on Allakhazam's. I've also looked on EQDruids
(no, I'm not a druid) and they seem to have a full write up, but now I'm
confused about something else - the war.

I've been in JP a few time when someone was starting up the war. I had
always understood that to be part of the Qeynos Badge of Nobility quest, but
I don't see any requirements about that in the quest text at all. So, I
think I know what I need to do the Qeynos Badge of Nobility quest, but what
the heck is the war all about - is there another layer to this quest or
perhaps a different one worth doing?
