I made a Vah Shir Warrior, and of course running all over to complete my
citizenship quests, etc. Well, I completed those, and then turned in my 4
femurs to Guard Hebijeb, He tells me to assist Dronqam Ronghi, So I go find
him (No easy task, I must say) And hail him, He says to assist him, I need
to send him people seeking work... and that is it.... I go back to the
guard, and nothing. I cannot find any NPCs looking for work... anyone
successfully done this? Thanks.
