Well, lets see, hotkeyable, does not take up a spell slot, extra mez 
available, can't imagine what benefit that could possibly have...

As a shaman, I have an AA that allows me to knock a mob back and root it.  
Now, you could ask what possible use could that be, I have root already, 
quite a variety of roots even.  Same deal, hotkeyable, zero mana, no 
spell slot root.
