I know about the massive experience loss at levels 31,36,41,46.  From
what I remembered it was always 5 blue or 1 yellow.  I just died at
level 41 and lost 6 blue? This is a lot more experience than I
remember losing in other post hell levels.  Is this a new thing or has
it always been around at level 41?
