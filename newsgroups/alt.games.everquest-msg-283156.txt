What it boils down to is that the ad says:
"you authorize SOE to charge your credit card the subscription amount
($99.99 plus applicable taxes) immediately upon signing up for the
Sixth-Year Anniversary 12-month subscription plan and again at the
beginning of each subsequent 12-month subscription period."

If you don't think about it, it sounds like you will be charged $99 a
year.  But another way of reading it is "you will be charged THE
SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT every year" (whatever that subscription amount may
be at the time).  

Which sort of makes sense... no one promises you a cast in stone
forever price.  But certainly the way the ad is worded seems
misleading... if it said something like "the subscription amount
(currently  $99.99...)" that would be pretty clear.
