So you advocate using a fascist law to achieve the correction of a netequiette
more?  Would you also announce to other brown-shirt types that a jew was hiding
in the next-door apartment because his snoring went through the walls at night
keeping you awake, and then proudly say, "I am not a fascist! I simply use them
to enforce the local polite rules regarding bothersome noise!"

Maybe if someone owed you $10.00 you would turn them in to Joe McCarthy, and
state you were just teaching them a lesson.

No, don't bother to answer. You will never understand that having sex with
Saddam Hussein makes you his sex partner. 


The sad fact is that while I really have no like for racists, their evil tends
to be out in the open. Your kind of evil, however, drapes itself in subtle silk
that slowly tightens around the neck of any liberty...
