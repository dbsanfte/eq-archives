I had the exact same problem after logging into the test server myself about
a month back.  All animals were screwy, and my Iksar scaled wolf warder
looked very odd.  While this was actually helpful in finding Drakkel Dire
Wolves in the snow, since they'd be striped a few shades of brown, I got
pretty sick of it.  Follow the advice above... get rid of the .txc files.
Worked fine for me.
