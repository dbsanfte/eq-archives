Don't think of your pet as a tank, think of him as a mana-free dot
that's active while you're tanking. He can't take a hit but can dish
it out pretty well. That won't really ever change, your pets do get
tougher at higher levels but they'll never, at any level, tank well
compared to the real pet classes. 

Not sure what the problem is with disengaging your pet. ... fighting
giants maybe? Some of those have such a long reach that it's almost
impossible to back the pet out since the giant has a much longer melee
range than the pet.  

>One last question.  Can a Shaman pet dual wield?

Yes, if you give him 2 weapons. Pretty sure even the lvl 34 pet will
dual wield.
