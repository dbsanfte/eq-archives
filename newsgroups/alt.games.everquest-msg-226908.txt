There are three kinds of lies in this world.   Lies, damn lies and
statistics.

You have to really play with the numbers to arrive at the conclusion that
being 5 percent worse is really 20 percent worse.  "Honest, it is."   Yes,
slowed a mob might have 60 DPS with an enchanter slow on, and only 50 DPS
with a shaman slow on (Ack, it's doing 20 percent more damage!) ...  but
that 10 dps reduction is pretty meaningless compared to the ~150 DPS
reduction from it being unslowed.

Aye, pretty similar.   Losing 1600 experience with a paladin rez is much
more traumatic than losing only 1000 with a cleric rez.   Until you kill the
next mob and gain 7,500 experience points....

Give me a break...

Now, be honest.   Did you really notice a visibile difference in damage
taken when you had an enchanter slowing for your cleric versus a shaman of
the same level?


Damage once a mob is slowed is almost nothing.   Even increased by 20
percent, it's still almost nothing.
