I was able to just type part of the name and get directions..... but only 
when it was unique.  I just put in "carpenter" and was led to the carpenter 
in Graystone.

Also, if you are a long way away from the npc you are looking for, there is 
a good chance that the guard doesn't know them..... keep trying guards and 
when you get close they will help you.
