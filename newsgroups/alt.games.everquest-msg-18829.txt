Coming from a person you don't want to hear from, and not even knowing if you'll
read this...

The reason there is no middle class, or rather a very small middle class is
because people are either considered new or old.  When you begin to reach the
uber levels, you'll begin to understand how people come by money and items.
Then you'll realize that you're not a regular guy but rather a poor person.
When you hit 50, you'll know the difference between people who have 3 level 50's
and people who only have the one.  And when you get a character up to that
level, you'll realize how easy it is to twink out people in full banded.  Well
time to play darts. Bye!
