It's amazing how many EQ players have read this story.

Every so often an /ooc or /shout conversation will prompt
some wag to provide a smart-ass response like, "I heard
that was in Burned Woods", and then 3-4 other people
will pop in with "Isn't that near Felwithe this week?",
and so on.

It's nearly as popular as Monty Python skits.
