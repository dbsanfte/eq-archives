Same thing happened to me.  Recently reformatted PC and re-installed all my
EQ expansions.  For some reason POP installed to another directory.  Patch
then updated the original directory, and hence POP did not work.  In the end
I deleted the POP directory, reinstalled POP to the right place and then
repatched.
