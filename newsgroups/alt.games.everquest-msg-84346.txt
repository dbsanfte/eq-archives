This is no longer true - it just causes it to follow you, like
/pet follow me.  This was changed a long time ago (before I 
created my mage in Sept of 2001).

You forgot /pet guard here - this causes your pet to stay in one
spot, and return there after a fight.  It differs from pet sit 
down in that, with that command, the pet stays right where it is
after a fight rather than returning.
