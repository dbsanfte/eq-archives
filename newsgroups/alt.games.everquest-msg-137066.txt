What's "Clintonesque" about a blunt statement?  Of course, YOU are
muddying the waters.  You never said anything about Big Brothers and
Big Sisters.  Your question was :

> >> So, you are saying you don't see anything wrong with homosexuals
> >> mentoring kids??

But I'll let you get away with the mis-direction.   No, I see nothing
wrong with gay, bisexual, and lesbian adults mentoring mentoring kids
as part of the services offered by Big Brothers - Big Sisters of
America Inc.

> By logical inference, then you must also approve of having men being
> the mentors for women and vice versa, correct??

Oh, that's your idea of a "logical inference" is it?   The idea of Big
Brothers was to provide male role models and companionship to boys who
needed such.  Gay men are men.   Unless you confuse "gender" with
"sexual orientation".

The direction you're going with this is pretty obvious, but go ahead
and hang yourself.
