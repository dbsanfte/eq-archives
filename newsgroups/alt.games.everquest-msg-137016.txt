Since it always seems like the 'all-rightious'   ; )  Enchanters are
always  complaining about everyone that does not listen to them,  I
thought I would throw this in as a contrast.  (humor not sarcasm. They
are right 99% of the time and I dont want to start a fight.)

Last night I was grouped with a lvl 32 chanter  (I'll leave his name
out to be polite) who didn't seem to be mezzing anything successfully
at all and was doing some awful complaining about broken mezzes.
After a heated discussion with our tank, it turned out that the
chanter had made an assist button, was assisiting our only
tank/puller/main-assist  then casting a single target mezz.

I was happy to see that the leader, once we figured this out, politely
educated him instead of maddly kicking him out.  He did fine as soon
as was told his error and ended up saving us from a serious overpull
about 20 minutes later.

Although I was on edge from a lack of confidence in him, I was
refreshed to see patience win out over the so much easier choice of
disbanding and abandoning.  He's a better player now and no enemies
were made.

Still, you gotta wonder, he was lvl 32........
