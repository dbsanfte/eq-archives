Two wrongs don't make a right.  The wizzy was more than likely a
little pissy because he just put in the time to get spawn and someone
just pops in and announces that it's his spawn despite the fact that
he was no where near the camp for the last four hours.  Frankly, Mark
is as big a dick in this situation as the Wizard was.

But don't let facts get in the way of your highly pathetic flame.
