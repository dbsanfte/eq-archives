First off you need to make sure you have a good driver install. From
your post it appears that you may have had some bad
installs/uninstalls and this could be part of the problem.

Follow the directions at the following URL to completely remove the
old/current drivers

http://www.rage3d.com/forum/ubbhtml/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20010104-13-004006.html

Download and reinstall DirectX8.1
http://www.microsoft.com/directx

If your MB is using a Via Chipset Download and install the latest 4in1
Driver set. (Current version is 4.37)
http://www.viahardware.com/download/index.shtm#4in1

Next Download and install the latest drivers for the 8500.

I am running the 4.13.9017 set, and so far I haven't had any problems.
I am going to try the newer 4.13.9021 drivers tonight.
