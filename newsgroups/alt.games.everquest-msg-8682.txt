The first time I took that run with my druid I was level 35.  I remember
that trip...scared the crap outta me.  Brutes and Yetis and Giants, oh my!
And they're all OVER the danged place!  I don't think my pulse dropped below
150 the whole time.

SoW yourself, Skin yourself and get a levitate.  Ignore everything.

From the druid ring go SE until you see the cave.  After you go through the
cave go STRAIGHT WEST.  Your position will be about p173, nWhatever when you
emerge from the tunnel.  You'll be heading about 9000 feet west, and only
200 north to get to the FV tunnel.

And ignore everything.

If one of the spiders happens to root you (not likely but possible) snare it
so that if you survive he's not likely to be able to do it to you again.  Of
course, better yet would be to try to avoid spiders, but the aggro radius is
a lot smaller than you'd think...100' maybe.

My monk has made the run at level 12 and 16.  At level 30 you have more to
worry about in FV if you take the boat, *I* think.
