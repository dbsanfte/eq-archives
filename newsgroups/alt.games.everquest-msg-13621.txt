Since you ask a question to the snooper, I won't get on your case.  But I
would conclude in general unless they are repeatedly snooping you, that YOU
are the *rude* person in this case, not them. ;)  I hope you accept "just
wanted to see what you possess" as a satisfactory answer (unless of course
they then shower you with tells asking for stuff).  And yes, I would agree
with bizbee to seek medication.
