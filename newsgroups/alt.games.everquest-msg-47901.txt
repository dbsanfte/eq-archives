Rangers are better and perferred for this in PoG.  The Protector of
the Groves are timed spawn and they also beeline for any KOS person
that's in the zone.  Ranger tracking has enough range to actually give
you some warning before they show up.  A druid tracking, by the time
you pick them up on radar, you have about 20 seconds to prep for them.

Ideally rangers should play the role of long range scouts.  Druids
should be suicide corpse draggers as they can bind in PoG and just pop
up naked to go drag again.
