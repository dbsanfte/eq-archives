Humans level faster (no racial XP penalty) and according to Casters
Realm they hit a little harder at higher levels.  Plus, as you note,
they're KOS in a lot fewer places.  

Downsides of human vs Iksar:

* Night blindness (not as bad as it used to be)
* No forage, normal Swimming skill
* Newbie zones aren't as good
