The other night I grouped with a great 'chanter in Seb.  Got on
her good side while we were moving toward our camp spot.  Picked
up 2 froggies at once, and one of them took a swipe at me, so
of course, Spike goes after him.  She stunned, I backed off, she
mezzed - boom, we were good.  But even she got confused as to 
which mob Spike was on once.  They were close together (the frogs)
and Spike was sitting right on top of the one she was trying to
mez.  Now I *knew* nothing had hit me or Spike before I sent him
in to the fight, and I *always* assist the MA after I see the 
assist message.  She said "pet", knowing I would try and get spike
off after the stun, but he wasn't on hers, her mez just broke early.

I don't take that sort of thing badly, because I do make mistakes,
earlier that night a wizzie had cast on me as he closed, *before*
Spike attacked the target I wanted.  I didn't realize it, because
it was so crowded, so I always appreciate the heads up that he
was on the wrong mob.  Again - Stun/pet back off/mez. 

Some enchanters just won't go the extra step to work with the pet
caster, by giving the heads up, stunning - then mezzing.  Telling
a primary pet class (BL, Mage, Necro) to give up their pet before
working out that sort of teamwork is just being a prima-dona (sp?).
