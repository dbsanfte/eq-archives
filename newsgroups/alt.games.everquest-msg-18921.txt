This seems a bit vindictive, doesn't it? Let's see, you selflessly
respond to every request for a rez or whatever all day long... but if
someone happens to be anon, you decide, basically, since they don't
play the same way that you do, well, fuck them, basically. Surely,
it's your game and you are allowed to play any way you want... who
gives a flying fuck if the person you're helping is sick of getting
twenty requests an hour from some idiot in the zone wanting a clarity
or SoW and wants them to come to him and do it for free.... he
certainly deserves no help, the filthy pig. What the hell does that
have to do with your helping <him> when he needs it?
