Are you incapable of remembering what you posted in this thread?
Here, let me remind you:

[Emphasis added by yours truly]

This ridiculously stupid conversation DID NOT begin by you saying,
"I'd hire some programmers to completely rewrite EverQuest for Cray
supercomputers so that it could leverage lots of CPUs."

Liar.  You mentioned emulation, and you just can't leverage a bunch of
CPUs in order to emulate PC hardware.  You could only leverage a few.

I'm still holding out hope that you'll "get it" at some point.
