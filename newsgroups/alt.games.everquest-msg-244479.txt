Bit of an exageration there: Stave of shielding(1HB), Zekhas
Khatar(H2H) to name  just two of the top of my head of the dozens of
weapons that cost between 6pp and 30Kpp.  Yes there could be more.

According to the EQLive boards you mentioned once a monk hits 1340 AC
with all the avoidance and mitigation AAs (1150AC without the AAs)
each 40 extra points of AC gives one real extra AC.  So a monk with a
displayed AC of 1800 (with AAs) would have a REAL AC of 1351 ... ouch!

IIRC it's 1 real /4 shown AC for a warrior and the softcap itself is
much higher (no idea what their softcap is).
