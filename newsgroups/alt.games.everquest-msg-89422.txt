Actually, that's EXACTLY what you can do.  It sounds like
they're dubious to you (since they said the "your head..."
line instead of "i really hate rogues like you...you've ruined
your own lands, you won't ruin mine!" so you don't even have
to worry about hiding.  Just get behind the quest-giver and
hit sneak...don't hail or he'll turn around, but then hand
in your picks.  You'll stay indifferent as long as you're
sneaking behind him, and indifferent may be good enough
for the quest.
