Well, I can promise that the corpse locate song works perfectly.  Died before
the patch and had to use song to locate my corpse so I can start playing my
enchater.  I am on the vaz server and I did a who all bard search around 1pm
fewer then 20 playing.  I swear this had better be an acident, because if not
bards will become an extinct class.
