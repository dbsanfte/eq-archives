Not fair? Bad manners? How are wars won people, with polite fairplay?? NOOOOO!
Someone declared a war-someone accepted. All is fair in love and war. 
Hint...if you declare a war on a guild, you might want to wait til the war is
over to have any fun filled parties or large gatherings where everyone gets
drunk and puts away their weapons -lol- 
If you do =decide to party during a guild war, you best have a cleric on call
for some serious rez's :-)
