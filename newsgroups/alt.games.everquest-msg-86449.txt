I think you're misunderstanding me.  In a normal exp group battle, the bard
*usually* is near the top of the hate list, and would (in my bard's
experience) keep the mob's attention if there were not a taunter around to
get aggro away.  Sure, a wizard could nuke early and grab aggro, or someone
could pull with an 800dd nuke/stun, but i'm talking realistic everyday
grouping situations.  My original statement was not that bards couldn't be
outtaunted, just that they are usually on the top of the hate list.

It has nothing to do with adds, it has to do with bards trying to tank.
If I pull and get aggro, then get back and start twisting songs, it's
extremely difficult to get that mob off of me. If someone does get it off,
it will usually be on me again as the next twist cycles.  So there I am,
tanking with near-caster HPS, and you don't see a problem with this?  Note,
i'm not talking about raid pulling, where you're just a delivery boy.
