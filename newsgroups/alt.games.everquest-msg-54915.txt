Depends on where in the zone. There are a couple of nice spots to hunt
in that dungeon on the third level that a small group could easily handle
and pull to. Plus the loot in that zone is damn nice, lots of fine steel drops.
Main reason no one is in there is because its a bitch to get out if you
can't port and its pretty remote so banking and selling is a bitch unless
you are Iksar.
