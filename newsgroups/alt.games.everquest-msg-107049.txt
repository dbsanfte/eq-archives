I desire the collective intellect to bend it's attention to this question.
:)

1/. Are the charm durations for Chanters and Bards the same? (of equivalent
level)
I know that it is extremely randomn, but on average (all other things being
equal) which is longer, if either.

2/. It is great fun when soloing my chanter, but is it useful or dangerous
when in groups?
I have grouped with a Bard that would insist on charming things only to have
the charm break seconds later and the MA have to turn from the mob he was
attacking to try and save a class who does not have anywhere near the HPs to
survive long under direct attack. (please add commas as desired to last
sentence)
