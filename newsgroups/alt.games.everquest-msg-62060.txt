I'm in the same boat, I'd go Athalon 1.4 ghz proc on a motherboard
that takes your old kind of ram (most likely 168 pin sdram dimm pc
100? pc 133? ) either one will work in the athalon in a new
case/powersupply if needed and toss everything else in. Then I'd get a
256 meg similar ram dimm and toss that in also. 

Finally I'd get at least a geforce 2 64 mx. You'd be super velious
ready and upgraded fairly cheap.

Get sisoftsandra shareware. Run the first few like motherboard/memory
or whatever. It tells you exactly what kind of ram you have now.

For instance it tells me I have 2 64 meg dimms and that they are
Wintec 64 meg 8x(8mx8) SDRAM PCI 100 322-622 (CL3 up to 100 mhz)

If you are not sure what pins they are (but more than likely 168 pin)
you could take one out and count them if anything else but you
probably know from that.

Then you look for the athalon MB that has like 

"3x 168-pin SDRAM 
Maximum 768MB SDRAM 
PC-133 "

or 

"2x 168-pin SDRAM 
Maximum 1.5GB SDRAM PC-100/133"

like one like this for instance:

See that second one takes 100 or 133. I'm presuming if yours is 100
mhz instead of 133 that the ram will all run at 100? Or maybe dimms
are more independant. The nice thing is the 133 mhz dimms ARE
backwards compatible so they even run in 100 mhz mboards at 100 mhz
merrily.

Or this is an example of a mboard which is also athalon with 184 pin
ddr ram:

This is just the outlet place near me.. Im just posting it as an
example. There are likely cheaper places on the web but I love this
place because of course if anyting goes wrong i drive a mile away,
yay!
