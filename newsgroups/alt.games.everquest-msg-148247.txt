Exp per mob has definitely gone down.

Every Sunday morning we would go there for 3 hours exp grind.

Me (lvl 60 chanter), lvl 60 druid, 57 warrior, 58 cleric, 60 rogue and
another usually lvl 58 - 60.

We always took South wing and in three hours I would make at least one
yellow to one and half yellow AA exp. This is no longer the case , I think
we are making about 30% less. East wing yields better exp but still not as
good as before.

This week we went to Chardok and went deep in, made very good exp here but a
lot tougher.
