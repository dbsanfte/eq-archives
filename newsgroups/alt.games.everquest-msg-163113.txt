Normally I'm not the vain type so I always go for stats rather than looks,
but, after a rather good week in HoT I've managed to kit myself out with a
Woven Grass BP, Boots, Sleeves, and Bracers. The problem is now I'm left
with a character in a rather nice shade of green...... and brown pants!! to
say he looks pretty goofy is an understatement :-(

Could anyone recommend a pair of Tunarean Dru Elf wearable 'pants' that have
a green graphic (apart from Verm and of course Woven grass lol), money *is*
a problem atm but as I'm well over the 255 Wis cap then I don't mind a few
naff-ish stats on them ;-)

Many thanks
