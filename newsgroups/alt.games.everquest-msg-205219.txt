I have heard such a rumor but can't track down any posts about the matter.  This is standard
procedure for mage and necro pets, but the haze of secrecy surrounding it for shamans is such
that I wondered if there was something tricky required to really make it work; slashing weapons,
blunt weapons, heck, piercers... something.

I also haven't noticed any difference in damage output from the pet with or without weapons,
leading me to suspect I -was- doing something wrong.
