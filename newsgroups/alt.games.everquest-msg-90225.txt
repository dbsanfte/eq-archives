It's a kinda weird place. Once, a 51 warrior single pulled there,
another time (last time I was there) a 54 SK got two when he pulled.
They pulled from exactly the same spot, too. And just a Warrior and
a cleric might be cutting it a bit close, IF they get more than one
at a time. Lowest/least amount of people I've been there with, was
52 cleric, 51 Warrior, and 50 enchanter. We had no problems, and this
was the single-pulling warrior, so we might not have NEEDED the ench,
but it was nice to have him along anyway, for buffs/debuffs as well
as clarity for me, hehe.

Hmm, that might be a good idea. We never had problems with runners,
but we were two stunners/rooters, and on one occasion an SK who
snared'em. And it's not so much that he flees earlier, it's just
that he has more HPs, so he lasts longer while in flee mode... And
another good reason to have a snarer along is that the snarer can
invis Jakugg, who most likely is very KOS to live frogs from his
childhood in da swamp... Green agro sucks, hehe.

Two on each side, and two up on the ledges, yes, but that makes 5 ;)
The two on the sides are usually warriors, and the two on the ledges
seem to always be shamans. There's a chance one of the warrior frogs
might be the tactician instead, and IIRC, he's a wizzy, no? Oh, and
occasionally a wanderer enters the camp. That makes it 6, then.

Oh, and on my server he seems to be taken fairly often. That camp is
still good exp at low 50s, and the froggy crown are easily sold, it
seems. Hard to beat old-world mobs for easy exp, man those suckers
have low HPs and hit like little girls!

BUT! Another horror story: We were on the way to the King, and had
cleared the elemental room, and the SK pulled mobs to it to clear
the way. One pull, he comes back with ALL the mobs between Ele and
King, AND all the king mobs! Luckily he noticed the adds before he
reached us, and FD'd, and we all camped out to clear possible agro.
No idea why all the frogs added, he was nowhere near King when he
pulled...
