    I know what he's talking about. The general rule is:

If it's 51+, it can summon. If it isn't, it can't.

    There are a small number of exceptions to this rule. The old-world
sample exception is Fire Giants - they can spawn as lower than level 50
mobs, but they can all summon. The only way to tell if a mob can summon, if
you want a general rule, is to damage it a bit and see if it summons you.
