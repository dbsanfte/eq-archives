Oh, good fucking lord! Raising the cap to level 65 made characters
disgusting enough! Do we need an even higher level cap?!

We already have had at least one running around with their epic at
LEVEL FREAKING **2** on one server due to the help of a couple (Only a
couple) level 65 friends walking him through the quest. There's one 65
BST who's soloing the entire epic quest just for kicks. The power
level is just silly enough as it is, we don't need another bump in the
level cap...
