Nah. Do what I did.

1.  Buy six full backpacks of red wine in Cabilis.
2.  Run or get a ride to Nektulous
3.  Become invisible
4.  Run through Neriak to the library in Third Gate (see EQAtlas.com)
5. Uninvis. Everything in the library is on either Beta Neutral or
Temple of Soulsek Ro faction, both of which are indifferent to
leezards.
6. Hand the scribe the bottles, 4 at a time, unstacked and submit.
7. Invis back up and run to the bar in Neriak Foreign Quarter
8. But at least 4 more backpacks full of Red Wine
9. Repeat the quest.

Once you've done this quest around 1,200 times, you will be on good
faction with all DEs *except* in Third Gate. This will allow you to
bind and bank and all that good stuff.
