At 35 shaman and druid are considered healers. At 50 they aren't
At 35 ranger is considered a tank.
At 35 most classes can solo

I do agree that the idea of the game is the same, but you strategy, 
content, and (to a degree) your role change. I'd have absolutely no 
problem with that happening in DAOC as well :)
