They probably did this on purpose... I know SOE has been dead-set against
single-zone quest exploits like this -although why they didn't simply remove
the fish corpse from the drop tables of the pond Koalindl I have no idea.

Probably the identically-named corpses have different identifier tags, and
turning in a corpse from a fish you killed in the pool gives you a negative
faction hit, while turning in the fish corpse from that wolf (thus doing the
quest the "proper" way) will give you the positive faction hit.

There used to be a neat single-zone quest in Erudin that would repair your
Freeport Militia faction without any other factions going down.  I even
wrote a walkthrough on how to do this quest on Allakhazam's.  Alas, SOE
eventually broke the quest and it no longer functions.

So I think you're stuck repairing your faction the hard way - gold pieces or
bone chips or doing the complete fish quest.
