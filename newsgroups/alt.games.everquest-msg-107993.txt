  Not a valid comparison.

  A more accurate comparison would be calling up tech support, and getting
one of their less experienced techs, and describing your problem to the
tech, only for him to refer you to another tech... you wait on hold for
several minutes, and when the more experienced tech gets on the line, he has
you describe your problem in detail again, without giving any initial
impression that he had any previous awareness of your problem.

  You can't call a phone number and expect them to psychicly know your
precise problem... but if you give a reasonable description of your problem,
I think you have a reasonable expectation to not have to repeat yourself to
someone who seems not to be aware of your previously given description, or
at least gives no indication of such awareness.

  Is it arrogant and spoiled to expect this level of service?  I guess you
can call it that.  It's better to err on the side of caution and politeness
where such things are concerned, however.  The canned response to petitions
doesn't make Verant CS service bad, it just contributes to its mediocrity.
