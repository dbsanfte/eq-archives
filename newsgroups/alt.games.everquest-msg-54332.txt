Not sure what zone Deep Tomb will be in but guessing it will be the
bloated belly graphic for a ship but maybe in OOT.  I am guessing there
will be more Werewolves in more zones or at least the zones that already
have them.

Well lets see.  Sounds like more undead in Befallen, or another event
ala bloody Kithcor.  The Return of the Combine, well the combine were
supposed to be on luclin, I am guessing this will somehow tie into the
portals to Luclin.  Shissar one of the new monsters from Screenshots,
and former rulers of the Iksar are "Snake-Men" so probably they will be
putting in appearances in some of the other zones.  And it looks like
either new zone, or part of Luclin will be Plane of decay.
