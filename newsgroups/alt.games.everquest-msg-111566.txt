Low numbers due to better and more up to date competition (Aces High,
Warbirds, Fighter Ace, and better boxed sims with dynamic campaigns)

You have very little understanding of business. "Bean Counters" are
not evil people that look for ways to kill off games at the expense of
the customers. They are the people who have to pay the bills, and when
the money isn't there to pay the bills, the game dies. The #1 priority
for all companies is ALWAYS paying the bills.

LOL! I know EXACTLY how AW (WBs, AH, FA) are played

1. Capture the flag field take overs (Quake style CTF game model)
2. Get shot down and instantly respawn/rejoin the low level furball
between the closest opposing fields. (typical Quake style match)
3. Most players flying the "Uber-Plane" with the best guns and
performance. (typical Quake BFG mentality)
4. Parking flak panzers at the ends of runways to kill planes when
they attempt to take off to pad scores. (typical Quake style score
whoring)

"More" does not mean "plays different".

Wrong, you do have to. Otherwise you are just making false claims and
accusations. If you cannot support your argument, then admit it, and
quit hiding behind statements like "those that know what I am talking
about".

No, but I wouldn' expect you to know what one is. You have repeatedly
demonstrated that you are clueless on the issue.

No I do not have a problem. I disagree, and we are exchanging posts
over that fact. I guess things are just moving a little to fast for
you to keep up.
