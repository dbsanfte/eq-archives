My Guesses:

> }Which virus program missed it?

McAfee

> ...and which program caught it?

Symantec


Since McAfee was bought out their interface gas improved 1000%, but their
scanning engine has fallen behind.  I have personally seen the last and
latest version miss five different viruses on the machines of customers of
ours.  Upon installing Symantec Norton Antivirus we caught 4 of these.  The
fifth was caught after doing the upgrades to the virus definitions.
