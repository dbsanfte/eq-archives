: Thanx all that helps alot!\

While you are making macro's you might as well make on the helps with your
sense heading.  At about level 8 - 10 the compass becomes half way usable if
you have SH max'd.

What i did is switched to the abilities page and clicked on ability 6 and
set it to sense heading.
Now go to the macro page and mack a macro called Direction.
in the first text field type /doability 6
click accept.
now left click and hold the macro for about 3 seconds and it will make a
copy of it's self that float's.  Put that in hotbox 10.

now go to the options screen.  ALT + o click on keyboard and show all ( i
think that's what it is called.
Go down to where it say's hotbox 10 and in the second colom click the - -
now hit your left or right direction arrow.


Now every time you turn in that direction you will be practicing SH.  You
will max it out in now time.  Mine is normaly maxed before my second MOB.

Hope that helps.  Here is a link for a great Macro building sight.
http://www.eqguild.net/macros.html  just don't do the SH the way they say
to.  it will lock you up for 7.5 seconds where you can't do anything untill
the macro ends.

Omiin.
