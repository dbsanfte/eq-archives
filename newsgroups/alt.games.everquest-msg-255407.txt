He may not know how it happened, or even that it has happened.  I remember 
a variant of this bug from a looong time ago.  I'd DCed a giant in Kael 
and cast NDT on it, and was working my way toward the arena... Another 
group came up behind me and was going 'wow!' and 'ooh' and 'aah', and I 
asked what was so special.  Apparently, where I saw a normal human-size 
scarecrow beating the crap out of a giant's kneecap, they saw a ginormous 
scarecrow slightly larger than the giant it was stomping.

So, the size you see their pet as may not be the size they see their pet.
