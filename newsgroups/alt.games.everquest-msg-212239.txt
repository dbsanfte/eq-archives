Forget Torpor, its pretty much useless when you get Stoicism at 44.  Torpor is a
rare or expensive spell you have to get to 60 for... Stoicism is the work of a
small group spending an hour or two at 44, huge change.  In retrospect I'd much
rather go with an Ogre shaman, soloing shaman end up as the punching bag of mobs
a lot, either tanking or later giving up melee but still stepping up and taking
the beating while pet does the melee damage, and end up casting while being beat
on all the time.  Not getting stunned would help a lot more than the miniscule HP
regen advantage I have as a troll.  Not getting Stunned "scales" as you level up,
being interrupted sucks just as bad at 50 as it did at 20, but 6 hp per tic means
a LOT less at 50 than it did at 20, even without Stoicism.  With Stoicism, I
don't even notice my natural regen, and thats supplemented with an Ikky BP and a
2 hp per tic regen neck.

Trolls also have access to a clicky snare neck, which sounds great but in my
experience, a clicky that takes 6 seconds to go off, gets interrupted very easily
(as though perhaps channeling doesn't apply), gets resisted a lot, wears off very
quickly, and is a DOT so you can't even use it on mezzed mobs without breaking
mez... well thats not worth much after all, despite my cleric dreaming about one
for 65 levels.

I'd go with Ogre shaman for the stun immunity instead in a heartbeat, and getting
an extra 5% exp per kill would sure be a nice bonus to that; that exp penalty
also scales, which is the problem with the troll regen thing; yes the regen is
great at low levels, and you don't really mind the 20% penalty... but when your
regen starts meaning less and less, the 20% really starts to stick in your craw.
