How much foresight does it take? Lets give a Wizard a irresistible nuke that
can do up to 28k of damage with little to know agro. "One" Wizards if he
uses it will be without mana for a short period of time and can't kill uber
mobs that will be enough deterrent.

How about a spell the silences a mob for 6 seconds and has an 18 second
recast time so "One" Paladin can stop mobs from cast for 33% of the time.

Takes real genius to come up what would happen if more then 1 was in a
group?
