Open up the options menu and there is a section for chat.  You can scroll
down and see all of the various text items that show up in the chat screen.
Each one is listed in the color that is used.  Click on the item you want to
change and a pop-up box will allow you to choose a color, or adjust any of
the colors with a slide bar to any custom color you like.  I used this to
change all of the items that were dark blue because they did not show up
well against the dark background.  Of course the background can be changed
too, but I prefer the dark background, so I changed the text items instead.

Some of this stuff may have already been available on the old transparant
screen UI.  I never used that one, so it's all new to me.
