Remember not only heals add aggro.  I (as a templar) died several times
because of slow casting 'pre-fight' buffs that actually triggered after
the tank pulled.  They all come for me.  I learned my lesson and now
don't cast group buffs if the tank is about to pull.
In any case.  The problem is, when a tanker pulls with an AoE taunt,
all mobs get his attention.  It's different than when a scout pulls, he
gets just one mob's attention.  Pulling with AoE taunt has a great
advantage, casters can start doing their massive AoEs right from the
start without danger (something I don't like about EQ2 but that's
another story). This is what happens:
- Scout pulling range very long
- Meleer taunt range short
- Casters spells range long
So, before meleer has time to taunt, casters can (and usually do) cast
as soon as mobs are in range, making mobs go after them.

In a well organized group, scout pulling may work, but for the most
part, it's better to have tanker pull with aoe taunt
