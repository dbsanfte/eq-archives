I felt the same way about anything but 1HS and 2HS for quite a while;  then
someone made me a good trade for a Sentry maul.  At 22dmg/43dly +5 STR it is
the hardest hitting weapon I've owned to date.  Thing is, I never trained in
2HB.  Thought about selling it, but I didn't want this beauty to get by me
just yet.  So I set off to train up my 2HB skill.  At 27th level, this would
suck!  Based on some good advise I've received here in this NG, I got an
Iksar newbie to fetch me a shovel (4dmg/ 27dly) from Cabilis, and proceeded
to find MOBs that flee (goblins, sarnaks, Iksar) and would switch-out when
they run.  I'm missing more than I hit, and my skill has come up to 21.
With 3 bubs left before I DING, I'm hoping to at least master this before
28th level.

    Look at it this way:  the more weapons you train in, the better prepared
you'll be when that "deal you can't pass up" comes along.

There's me 2cp
