Um, all I've got to say is that our assholes learned from the masters.
The Brits, French, Germans, Belgians, Dutch, Spanish, and Portugese
(hope I didn't leave anybody out) between them did an astonishing
amount of imperialism, economic, colonial, and military in just a few
short centuries.  We Americans hace barely scratched the surface of
what our creators/mentors did before us.  And lets not forget Muslim
imperialism, not to mention Chinese, Manchurian, Mongolian, Egyptian,
Assyrian, Roman, and countless others I've forgotten and/or not yet
learned of.

As for Brits talking shit about American "economic imperialism"...
Do you have any fucking clue what the "Opium War" or the "Boxer
Rebellion" were?  And what the fuck were the Brits doing in the
Crimea and the sub-continent in the nineteenth century?

bah!
