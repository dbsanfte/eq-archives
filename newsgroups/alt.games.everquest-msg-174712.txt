I remember being impressed by that as a young lvl 9 dwarven cleric in
Freeport.  First time I'd ever been off of Faydwer (only had two characters
at the time, the cleric and a wood elven ranger).  This was about 3 years
ago, and I still remember conning the named skellie walking toward me in NRo
(very, very red) and thinking that I'd made a huge mistake in leaving
Faydwer. :-)
