I had a chance to finally check my alcohol tolerance last nite in Freeport.
Some Dark Elf was being nice and gave me 3 bottles of Brandy. What a Nice
Guy:-)

 Well , instead of selling them like a good boy, I decided to try the
"Drunk" theory. So I drank all 3.

 At first it was funny, my speech was toasted, and I kept weaving, and
couldn't target a vendor for the life of me.

 Well, after about 10 minutes of watching this, my stomach kind of felt
woozy. I felt dizzy and a tad nauseous.

 I guess the moral of the story is, the programmers did a good job on the
character and his alcohol effects. But I didn't know that it would really
make me physically ill.

 Don't think I will be doing that again regardless of the quest.
