   I had a serious "Too much EQ" a couple
of days ago.  I was wandering around, getting
dressed for work.  Fairly awake, and not in 
that much of a hurry, I was brushing my hair
in the doorway to my bedroom when I heard 
the sound of a spell being cast in the other
room.  Sounded for all the world like a 
gate spell.  I froze, of course, and listened
more intently.  With the masking sound the 
brush in my hair gone, it took me only a 
couple of seconds to realize that my toilet
was running.  

Annie  <--- Just glad she didn't rush in to
            see the spell effects
