Ok here goes, apparently this was misunderstood. There is no way I could've
judged the patch, because I was unable to log in. That is why I said AFTER
patch sucks. This was multiplied, by the fact that it was my birthday and I
had the day off and was looking forward to having a day to play EQ (which
was a birthday present). I got up at 6:30 am to get a head start and then
wasn't able to play till well after 1:00pm.

I still think the game is great, just a lousy set of circumstances with the
patch day. I'm guessing that patch day is a monthly thing?
