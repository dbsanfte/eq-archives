Thanks Wulf, I just got an e-mail from my ISP telling me that they have 
upgraded my service so I can "experience" the next tier up on their cable 
service and simultaneously 3 day's worth of e-mail appeared.  and now I can 
connect to EQ.  I'd be willing to bet that this mysterious "upgrade" was 
the source of my problems.
