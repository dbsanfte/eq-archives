Yuk-yuk, still looking for the real answers, but I found this bit o' humor along the way:

---

The following items are scheduled for the upcoming patch on 25 November :
------------------------------ 

** Class Issues ** 

- Two new Warrior quests have been added. Similar in difficulty to the Warrior epic,
completion of these quests will grant the Warrior the ability to change class to Paladin
("Good" quest) or Shadow Knight ("Evil" quest). We hope this addresses the recent balance
issue with Warriors. Talk to a Warrior guildmaster in any city for the start of this
quest. 

- A quest for Monks has been added, similar to the warrior quest. A Monk may now choose to
undertake this quest and become a Ranger. We hope this addresses Monk balance issues. Talk
to a Monk guildmaster in any city for the start of this quest. 

- The Norrathian Police Force "Home Security Education" project has been a major success.
All doors in Norrath, Luclin and on the planes are now locked and require a key or "Pick
Lock" skill to open. This should address some of the Rogue and Bard issues. 

- Necromancers and Magicians are out of balance with other intelligence-based casters.
Therefore Wizards and Enchanters will be given Magician-style pets. To make up for this,
the Pegasus Feather Cloak will be added to Quarm's and Lord Inquisitor Seru's loot tables
in order to make it more available. Additionally, Necromancer pets will become mindless
dead (uncontrollable like old Enchanter pets). 

- Shadow Knights and Paladins who lose key factions will automatically change class to
Warrior. If you're evil, you should work on maintaining that evil faction, and if you're
good, you should work on staying good. Unfortunately, a side effect of this implementation
is that we cannot grandfather anyone, so if your factions are already ruined you may log
on to find you are a Warrior. 

- Added a Class Alternate Advancement for Bards. Spending 9 points on the "Milli Vanilli"
ability gives you the ability to make your songs appear as though they are being sung by
someone else. That person gets any associated aggression or benefit. 

- Random level 1-3 mobs in zones with Wayfarer camps have been given the ability to Death
Touch anyone who attacks them who is more than 20 levels higher than the mob. This ability
can function even if the mob is killed in a single blow. 


** Spells ** 

- The Camouflage spell now renders the target flash orange instead of invisible. Hunters
have to be safe, and safe hunters wear flash orange. If you want to traipse around without
being seen, use invisibility. 

- Call of the Hero no longer works on people who aren't heroes (have not completed their
epic). 

- All resurrection spells upped to 100% experience returned, but randomly delete an item
off the corpse being raised, or off the live character if the corpse has less than 10
items on it.
