 Yes.

 Everyone needs a key. It's like Sebilis.

 This is correct. There are two zone-outs. One in the end of South wing
and the other after Drusella in the East wing. These aren't exactly
trivial to get to. Also, unless you have a rogue, to get to them you
have to fight to the end of North wing, wait on the named to drop your
keypart

 There are two wandering mobs around the zone in. I believe that if you
don't move upon zoning in that wont aggro. They aren't that tough. The
only trouble you may have is if they are both HTing skellies. For this
reason let the tank zone/aggro first.
