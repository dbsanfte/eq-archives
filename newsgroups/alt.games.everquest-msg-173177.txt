This excuse to bomb Iraq because Saddam Hussain gassed the Kurds makes
me laugh.

The UN put up a motion to censure Iraq for this.  Who, I wonder,
vetoed this motion and is now, oddly enough, shouting the loudest.


As for comparisons with World War II.  It was all about economics.  We
all know that; it's in the history books.

The UK only declared war on Germany because of their refusal to
withdraw from Poland - our trading partners.  If Germany withdrew then
the rest of Europe would have fallen perhaps and we would have traded
happily with Germany.  

As it happened we entered the war.  After the Battle of Britain it
could have done two ways.  We could have continued or could have sued
for peace.  What would have happened was that we would have kept the
colonies in the Far East and carried on trading.  

If was the second meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt, as I
recall, which changed that.  Roosevelt wanted to get something out of
it if the US joined in.  Nothing to do with moralities or who was
right or wrong but what the US could get out of the situation.  The
same as us when we joined in.

You know what the deal was?  We had to pay the US for the use of their
men, ships and arnaments.  Payments that still went on to until the
1960s which almost bankrupted the UK.   Then we also had to give up
India, Malaysia and the African colonies because until then the US
didn't have a look in on the trade routes.  

Now, all it needed was an excuse for the US to join in.  Yes, Pearl
Harbor could have been avoided but without this event Roosevelt
couldn't go to the American people and go back on his word that
America wouldn't take part in another World War.

Sadly, many millions died for for the usual reasons; commerce and
trade.  It's hard, in fact, not to find a war in the history books
whose roots are not the same.   This one coming up won't be any
different.
