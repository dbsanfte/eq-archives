Yeah, I know I'm high, I meant to include a disclaimer that you can go quite
a bit lower.  Hell, I could probably make a good EQ computer for $500 if I
shopped around and went for cheap for the non-important stuff like floppy &
CD-Rom (who needs more than 4x in EQ or almost any other application?).  But
Joe noticed I forgot the memory so toss in another $50 for 512. :)  Eh,
details, details...like memory is important. :p

Yeah, if you're going to cannibalize another computer you might even be able
to save the cost of the case/power supply, along with the kb, mouse, hd,
floppy, cd.  Memory too, if it's the right number of pins, though I'd prefer
to go with the fastest RAM supported.
