: Why is it that so many players hate PvP?

I spent some time on Rallos Zek.  Got a mage up to the mid teens.

I got tired of having a group of 4-6 jump me, kill me within 20
seconds, take my money, and loot a valuable item, over and over
and over.  The corpse runs got old, too.

Overall, a terribly lame experience.  I really think you need to
make lots of friends and get into a guild pronto.  Then maybe
it's okay.
