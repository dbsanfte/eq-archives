Thanks again for replies. It was just a thought I had the other day. I know
there is plenty of stuff that fits into the RANGE slot but I wonderd if there
was anything that would work in the ammo slot.

I think the general answer is no. Pity as I am sure fletchers would benifit if
there was the odd arrow they could make that gave a minor stat boost!
