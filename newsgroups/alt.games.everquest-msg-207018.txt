I have spent approximately 10 hours farming wolves, bears, and spiders. I
grossed 700pp at Bazaar by underselling everyone in the zone. Total time
spent in Bazaar: 10mins real time. The buy-low-sell-high people almost ran
to me, which was my plan. I successfully filled up my Shaman spellbook for
level's 19-29, bought him a 100pp shield, then increased my Rangers
fletching from 71-78 (that ate up 300pp), and with the lefover 15pp got his
brewing up to 35 (from 0). I am so excited that I can now fund my
adventures!

I have had so much fun today: I remembered why I devote all my spare time,
money and sleep to this game! Thank you all for your support!
