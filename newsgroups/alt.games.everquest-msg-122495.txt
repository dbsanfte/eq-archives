Dont laugh, but I soloed 54 to 55 in about 24 hours of play as a warrior
doing the necro outside of fear.  She is pretty brutal the first time when
she is fully buffed, maybe get someone to help take her down.  After that
she is a 6 minute spawn, and goes down easy.  Just make sure to bring resist
gear if needed, she casts screaming terror which if you resist means
nothing.

24 hours and got like 2.5k in gems off her.  It was excruciatingly boring,
but there are no noobs back there (thanks spectres!) and no trains.
