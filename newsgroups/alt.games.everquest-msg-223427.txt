Which would be a very significant part of the answer.  Unfortunately, 
Commodore had the same problem when it came to the Amiga, their marketing 
sucked.  At the time it came out it was a superior computer in just about 
every aspect, but they did little to no marketing, relying mostly on word 
of mouth, and some computer magazines.

I remember the amazing difference in games that I played on the Amiga vs 
on the PC at the time.
