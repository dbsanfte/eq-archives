What makes you think a druid has good AC or melee?

Didn't the fact that the HIGHEST druid only AC item pre-Velious was AC
17 give a hint that druids might just not have such "good AC"
afterall?

How many classes have worse AC and melee than druids?  
Answer: 4.

How many classes have better AC and melee then druid?
Answer: 9.

Hey, what part of the bell curve does "good" start?
