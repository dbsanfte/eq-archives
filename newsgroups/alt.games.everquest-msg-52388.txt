    I am still playing my 1st character, Grogbut the Troll Warrior. When I
was level 5 I got a little bored with the swamp and running after little
fungus spores, so I hitched a ride with a mage to Greater faydark.  I want
into Kelethin, what do the guards have to con as before I can safely get
into the city without dying?

Thanks in adance
