If people don't like it, why wouldn't a company start a new game where 
it's not permitted?  Or have different servers as is done for PvP?  
Companies don't get rich by providing services their customers hate.

Looks like a free market to me.  What's wrong with it?  Entry costs to 
MMORPGs (not MMOGs in general) are a bit higher than many internet 
activities, but still low compared to many  bricks and mortar 
businesses.  If you want to start a new MMMORPG tomorrow, you can. (And 
you can run less massive online games with shareware levels of funding.)

Clearly you don't want it enough to switch off.  It is a result, of 
course, of free-market success - the logos are there because hundreds of 
channels are available to you.  Back in the days when we had only a few 
state-funded channels, there were no logos.  

But sure, the free market isn't going to preoduce perfection.  But it 
tends to be a lot better than the alternative.
