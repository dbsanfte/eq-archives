*applause*

And the best thing we could do is prove them wrong.

I've disagreed with you a number of times in the past in
this forum, but I'd like to say that so far all the posts I've
seen of yours on this topic have been beautifully on-target.
You've said what I would have said, and said it better than
I could.  Thank you.

Some people here would willingly ignite the circle of
vendetta and hatred that never, ever ends, of the sort
that already exists between Israelis and Palestinians,
or Pakistanis and Indians, and so on.

We must act to *end* this sort of violence, not act in
a way that only starts a new spiral of it.

And no, I'm not talking of diplomacy.  I am talking of
appropriate ultra-violence in response.  But at the
right targets, and in the right way.  Carpet-bombing
moronic civilians who treat this as a sporting event
is not the right target, or the right way.
