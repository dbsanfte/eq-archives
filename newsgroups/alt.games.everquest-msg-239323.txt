I've been having problems dealing with trackers lately and so I want to
state a point that it seems like alot of people dont get.  I play a bard and
so I pull alot in ldon.  When we start I tell the tracker (if we have a
druid or ranger) to please check track and give me compass direction if a
name shows up and then I can head that way.  For some reason they keep
telling me "he is left" or "he is that way".  That makes it doubly difficult
to find the direction for me.  I have to look around and find you, then
figure out which way your left is pointing.  What I would like you to do is
turn till your track says "the mob is straight ahead" then look at your
compass and read the direction off it.  Tell me the name is sw from here,
and I will look on my map and see which room he is in so we can take the
shortest route to get to him.  Make our jobs easier, not harder.
