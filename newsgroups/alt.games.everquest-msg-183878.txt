I was trying to improve the performance of EQ but it looks like I shot
myself in the foot. Last night I decided to mess around in the Windows
Control Panel to try to optimize the settings for my NVIDIA GeForce 4
MX 420 PCI card. Now when I try to get into EQ I get the following
error right after selecting my server, where the splash screen while
loading would come up:

Eqgame.exe has caused an error in EQGFX_DX8.DLL

Anybody know what this is and what the best settings for my card are?
I will keep trying to ponder through it as I try to get back into the
game.
