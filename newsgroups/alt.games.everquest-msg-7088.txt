The issue is time and convenience. Do you know how long it would take
to collect that many shark meats? Sharks don't drop meat every time
and even if they did it would take a long long time. With a wizard you bind
in Thurgadin, buy the meat, TP to Gfay, complete quest a bunch of times,
gate back to Thurgadin. Then rinse and repeat. Way too easy to make
money and exp.
