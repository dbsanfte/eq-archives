At least on Bristlebane, that doesn't seem to be the case. From what
I've heard (since I'm not in a raid guild and don't plan to be), the
elemental lvl guilds will backflag each other's members and I don't
hink they have any requirements for lower tier flags for memberships. 

I'm sure it varies from server to server though but I wouldn't have a
lot of respect for any guild that expects their members to have those
flags. Almost by definition, those guilds would be expecting lower
tier guilds to act as their stepping stones since nobody gets those
flags on their own. Any guild with that attitude I wouldn't want to
join anyway. 

Rgds, Frank
