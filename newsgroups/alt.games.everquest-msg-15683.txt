Slow what slow?
We weren't slowing CT v. 2.0.
Mainly because we never got a high level shaman to show up for the
damn muddite.

I didn't even realize they changed the resist table on CT v. 3.0 until
the necros started whining about their lifetaps being resisted.

We've always used the main tank + aggro control to beat him and when
folks listen (ie., don't push him up no stinking tree), we generally
drop the muddite with minimal of deaths (usually some numbnut caster
that got too close when CT rampaged and got bitchslapped for quad
600's).
