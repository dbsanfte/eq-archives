What is happening here is that there is a very widespread confusion 
about "song haste"; bards have two sorts of song haste, one that stacks 
with item and normal spell haste, and the far more common sort that 
counts as normal spell haste.  Since both are sung, people think this 
means they are all "song haste", which is probably bad name for the 
special category of songs which do stack.

Adding to this confusion is the fact that both the "song haste" and the 
spell haste buffs will stick and give you icons.  And the fact that most 
song haste buffs contain other buffs as well, which can add to your DPS 
even though the haste part itself might not be doing so.

This means that bards can stack two sorts of haste on themselves or 
people they are grouped with.

But it also means its very hard to talk them out of singing their normal 
type haste song even if you have an enchanter or shaman in the group who 
is keeping the melee hasted.

Here's an interesting twist for the parsers out there; a mage of my 
acquaintance recently insisted that his Burnout line stacks with 
enchanter cast Haste.  His theory is that Burnout falls into bard haste 
song category, so that his pet benefits from muzzle plus burnout plus 
enchanter haste... he claims that even without real parsing, enchanter 
haste is easily visible as doubling the attacks per minute from his pet.

If this is true, this would mean Burnout would have to fall into the 
Bard Overhaste category, because just as you observed with your parsing, 
ordinary bard song haste is no different than the cast spell haste from 
an enchanter or shaman or what have you.  Since burnout goes as high as 
85% haste, this would be a very remarkable buff indeed if it counts as 
overhaste, which will allow haste to excede the cap; normal overhaste is 
actually quite small, 5%, 10%, 25%...
