Some people have had significant problems connecting to the EQ chat servers 
after installing stateful packet inspection firewalls (I was one of them). 
At one time there was a FAQ on the topic somewhere in the EQ support site. 
Don't know of any other problems.

Same, and that policy has left me in far better shape than I would have been 
relying on any of the bloated, buggy, invasive third-party products that 
want to sit in my system tray shouting at me to do upgrades.

To get the hundreds of bug fixes and patches that get rolled into a service 
pack. I always install Service Packs and have never regretted it and I don't 
think it's ever been the cause of any problem I've had. It's usually other 
software and other behaviors (including my own) that are responsible for 
whatever problems I do have.

Not sure I agree that that was the intent. I would agree that the security 
features had that in mind, but remember, Service Pack 2 is a lot more than 
just a new firewall. Sure, nobody *needs* it, but then nobody *needs* SP1 
either. It's an update for an Operating System and anyone who wants to 
assure that they're getting the most recent, debugged version of the OS will 
have an interest in it.
