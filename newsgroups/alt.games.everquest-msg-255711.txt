Yeah, been debating paying for Allakhazam, but trying not to get too 
overzealous with my EQ obsession. I've had a tendancy to get really into 
a game for about 30 days then getting bored with it. This one just 
"feels" different than the others though, much more like my old AC days 
so I'm thinking this one might stick for a while. That said, if I'm 
still around next month, I'll likely pay for allakhazam's, I've already 
paid for Magelo. :)

I'm currently just starting what I think is my Paladin weapon quest but 
I don't think it is "newbie". From what I've read it takes a pretty high 
level to complete it. Its the Zamil blade quest.

Cool, will keep those in mind.

Thanks.
