You could have platinum growing on the trees and I still think nobody
would want to hunt in that gloom shrouded hell hole.

Different strokes for different servers, I guess. On Xev it's packed,
and not just with /auctioners either. Lots of folks cycling back and
forth between there and BB for the lowbie levels.

> Innothule: Is there anything here at all?

Doesn't need to be fixed at all. Hands down one of the best newbie zones
in the game outside of FoB. The *reason* nobody is there is because so
few people start trolls, and it's nowhere near a safe bind point for any
non trolls/ogres that it's impossible to hunt in. But I did 1 to 7 with
my troll there in record time. Limitless mobs and lots of guard
protection where you need it. Easy access to Feerott and UGuk for when
you get past level 7, also. And the look and feel of that place is
perfect for the troll and ogre folk. Hope they don't mess with it.

> West Karana: they like to change this zone for events all the time

Everything on the west coast out there is an empty hell hole. They
should just nuke the place unless they want to move the WK wizzy spires
up close to Qeynos. The sheer size of the zones, with so little going on
in them, makes it unpleasant for the newbies. If you start a character
in that area, you should leave ASAP for either everfrost or the greater
Freeport area.
