Nope.  First, rings aren't usually keys, and won't go on your keyring.  Some
are, though, like the Ring of Torden in BoThunder.  Second, a key goes on
your ring when it's used, not when you loot it.

>can I destroy the ring, or must I keep it?

If you see the key on your keyring, you can destroy the actual key.  As long
as you trust Sony not to do something stupid.  Personally, I've destroyed all
keys on my keyring a few days after first use, and don't expect any problems.

That's not a key, it's a flag.  Keys would have been so much easier and
straightforward for PoP, but they decided they wanted something brand new, 
buggy, and hard to figure out. 

Note that there are actual keys that never go onto your keyring as well, so
be careful.  Don't destroy any key (or ring, which might be a key) unless
you actually see it on your keyring.
