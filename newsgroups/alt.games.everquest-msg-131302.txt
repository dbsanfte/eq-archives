Yes it does work and it will work indoors or outdoors.
You have to group with person you want to grow though.
Keep in mind it only grows small races effectively, it will work on
ogres or trolls.. but you can't really tell the difference after its
casted.
Kind of like when you cast shrink on a gnome... don't really see a
difference there either.

It works just the reverse of shrink, ie..you cast shrink twice on a
orgre, troll or barbarian and they get to their smallest size.

Cast grow twice on gnome, dwarf, or halfing to get to their largest
size.

If you cast on human,iksar, half or high elf you will see a little
growth and only works once on them.

It uses no component to cast if I  remember correctly.
As to its purpose other then laughs....
I have only found one purpose for it, well have you ever played a
gnome and had a hard time getting over a ledge or obstacle that was
too big or high for you? Grow would be immensely helpful in those
situations, just as shrink is helpful for large races trying to get
thru a tight spot.
