Now let's be fair here. This is a business you know, and we have to be fair 
to SOE as well.

There are 31 days in December, and he did only lose 3 to 4 hours play time. 
So....

$12.95 / 31 = $0.42
$0.42  / 24 = $0.02
$0.02  * 4  = $0.08

So if you think you are liable for those 8 coppers, then send them a 
particularly nasty letter, and get your money back.
