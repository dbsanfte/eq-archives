There are other places to go besides Guk.  I'm always looking for a warrior
to tank, cuz as a ranger I have pitiful AC and getting whacked all day is
not very much fun.  If you have Luclin, you can go to Dawnshroud Peaks.
There are always people there soloing that would appreciate help from a
wandering tank, I know I do.  Usually small groups there working at xp, not
a lot of loot but can't beat the xp.

Have fun
