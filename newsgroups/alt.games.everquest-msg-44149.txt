 Really? Where? Being as how I play a 60 monk who is on a lot of the
'uber' raids I think I probably have a better understanding of things
than you do. I very seldom die on these encounters.

 I'm not going to argue a change that hasn't even happened except to say
I don't think it's going to leave monks lying dead all over the place.
We'll let time determine whether I am wrong or not.

 Everyday use of epics/1hbs is fine (excluding damage shielded mobs).
However, going into an enocunter with a boss-type mob, that's a bad
idea. Grab an Imbued Fighters Staff. While putting out nice damage
you'll be lucky to draw aggro very much.  It's all about using the right
tool for the right job.

 I wont argue with that. If FD actually worked like evade and lowered
your ranking on the hate list that would be a good thing. I just don't
see monks as being as broken as you.
