The answer to your question completely depends on your system.

If you have a decent gaming rig (ie: 512meg, 64meg vid card and 1ghz+ CPU),
the difference is quite striking.  Mostly because the 32x32/64x64 textures
have been replaced by 256x256+ textures in older zones.  Not all, but many.
The new SOL zones are even better looking.  IMO the new models are really
good with a few exceptions.

If you have a standard rig you will probably have to turn down most of the
graphics options.  And I have to emphasize there is a HUGE difference
between the low and high quality graphics settings.
