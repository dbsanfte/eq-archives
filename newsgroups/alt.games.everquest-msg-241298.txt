And that's the way it should work. I prefer top-posting, but bow to
the wishes of the majority here. If you (the general you) consider
top-posting important enough to do regardless of the norm, go for it
and, for God's sake, ignore the screaming loonies who throw themselves
on the ramparts whenever you do so. If it bothers you (again the
general you) so much that you don't want to read what a person has to
say, killfile them and get on with your life.

Top-posting vs. bottom-posting flamefests have got to be one of the
top ten stupidest and most pointless things that happen on Usenet.
And, considering that Usenet is a hotbed of pointless stupidity,
that's quite an acheivement.
