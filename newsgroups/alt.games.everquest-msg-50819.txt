Skull shaped barbute is a better deal than that, its the same ac I
think and 30 hp. Ac and HP are about the most important for a warrior.
Its also cheap.


>Neck   - Chipped Velium Amulet (Ac 4 Str 4 30hp)

Ah I think my troll sk is wearing that at 32 going for HP and such but
when higher there are many higher AC alternatives though I can't think
of any. Even the fine plate gorget I think is 7 ac.


>Arms   - Crafted

I'd get at least crustacean arms, I think same ac about but a huge
amount of stamina and some str. Or maybe crafted is higher. 


>Wrist  - Crafted

Ditto on crustacean.. though crafted might be higher ac can't
remember.


>Wrist  - Hero Bracer (Ac 9 10 str )

Crustacean.. same ac but some str and sta, until you get something
better.


>Finger - Plat Fire Wedding Ring (Ac 5 55hp)
>
>Finger - Jagged Band (Ac 5 Str 3)

No. Get two of the velium opal or whatever rings, the 6 ac 65 hp ones.
Those really can't be beat until you are getting crazy nuts rings like
the dain one or dragon drop ones. They are not even that expensive,
nearly free if you have an enchanter/jeweler friend who will just
attempt for the materials. Jagged bands are basically super low level
character items now. Str just is not really the biggest concern around
49 plus, its all AC and HP for a warrior (and resistence stuff to
swipe in for specific encounters)


>Hands  - Crafted
>
>Chest  - Rubicite (Ac 19 4hp tick regen & a lovely red color)

Wow the regen one? I'd frankly dump/trade/sell that since it has
pretty high value based on the regen which at 49 plus a warrior is not
going to really be using (warrior will always need a healer) and
instead go for ac. Heck someone would probably be nuts enough to trade
the 30 ac barbed bp from velks for the old rubicite regen bp since its
forever gone(price quote i heard on velks one was 10 - 12 k? ). Once
again, if not that, I'd suggest wearing a crustacean BP for the same
ac but a huge butt amount of stamina (like 15?) and some str then put
on the rubicite bp again to regen. Or if wanting more straight AC get
the venerable Enamelled black bp which is 25 ac for cheap and switch
it out with the rubicite (rubi for regenning)  That rubicite bp would
really be much better used by a shaman or someone and I think is quite
valuable now as a collectors item if nothing else, or are they as
common as mud on your server? They pretty much don't even exist on
trib since it was up just a bit when the nerf came, I think one is on
the entire server and constantly changes hands ;)

FBSS is fine. There are better back ones but they come from dragons..
more common now with the Cobolt scar dragon being so easy for a guild
but if you are not raiding them you won't be getting one.

I got lucky on my troll sk and got that kedge haste belt that is 4 ac
and 4 percent less haste than the FBSS, I forget the name.. (can
probably tell I don't play a melee most of the time..) dirt cheap
(traded a pair of rygorr legs and the blackened crystilline robe I
could never sell for it)

Hmm thats pretty ok item.. where does that come from ;) I'm always
looking for plus hp for my troll sk. Of course the totem from droga
that is 10 ac and a rare drop from the chief or whatever is a better
item for you.. but its rare and almost always camped (there again
though the rubicite bp would certainly go in trade probably for this
and other items)


>Primary  - Wurmslayer (Nice but a BIG stamina Drain)

Yeah wurmslayer is kinda long in the tooth around then. Since she has
a rubicite bp she is obviously on some old established server. I'd go
for some similar weapon to the cane of tranq that was fast with a good
ratio.

Yeah, ac hp etc.

She is planes level doable though, is she not in a guild? I'm asking
because based upon what she has she could use every slot drop for a
warrior from hate, Pog, or  any of the velious quest areas. If she
gets a guild who does such areas at all much, most of their warriors
will already have such areas filled meaning she'd win at least some
great things by default. Like in my guild we had some warrior running
around in crafted and an enamelled black bp when he joined now he has
nearly all TOV skyshrine armor.
