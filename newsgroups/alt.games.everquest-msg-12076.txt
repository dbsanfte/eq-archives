Well, my only objection is the inconvenience is having (normally) 4 or 5
people having to hit ok. Just seems like a bit of extra hassle, but I guess
it would be useful in some situations.

Bind is THE most deadly, in my opinion. Piss off an immature caster while
fighting in the middle of a dungeon, if he/she binds you and then pulls a
train, you're going to be caught in a death loop.

As Biz also said. I would guess this is why the grouping requirement was
originally used rather than a confirm box (although way back when you didn't
need to be grouped to cast invis on someone).

But, you can harass people in many ways regardless of whether you are
grouped with them (spamming them with group requests, emotes, etc). Not
implementing useful changes because they can be used to harass people is a
bit iffy, imo - after all, if you are being harassed, that's what /petition
and /report are there for.

In the case of Translocate in particular, having a confirmation box as well
as a grouped restriction seems like overkill. After all, it is targetable,
so the portal case you mention doesn't apply, and if you are grouped with
someone they can already royally screw you if they really want to.
