This depends on your definition of the word "tank".

I have tried repeatedly to introduce the term SPONGE to describe
the job that shaman do well, which is get the tar beat out of
them by the mob, soaking up the damage happily.  Sponges need not
deal any damage at all, -that- is DPS.  Yes, every class does (or
can do) -some- DPS, but the "DPS" classes main contribution to a
fight is that DPS.

A Warrior tends to be outdamaged by most of his group mates, yet
he often makes an admirable sponge, soaking up the hits while
others do the dirty work of actually making the mob dead.

"Tanking" sometimes means "sponging" sometimes means "does melee
damage" sometimes means both, and its very hard to tell which one
someone is referring to when they use it.

If your ranger does damage via bow (presumably from well outside
melee range) then he's NOT tanking by any of the above
definitions, he's doing pure DPS.

But if the shaman is standing there getting beat to a pulp while
this happens, he's Sponging; if he's not doing any (appreciable)
melee damage he's tanking only in the sense of the word that just
means sponging, he isn't doing melee damage and he's also not
doing "both".

If its better to use "rogue tank, and the shaman heal" then the
rogue sponge strategy is better (rogue meets all definitions in
this case), but if its better to use "shaman sponge while the
rogue backstabs, and the shaman heals himself" then the shaman is
the better sponge for the situation (and under one definition the
better "tank").

A third plan, though, is to have both in melee range, so the
rogue takes -most- of the damage, and evades just long enough to
backstab each time it pops up.  This would also be a case of the
rogue being the better sponge (and tank) if this turns out to be
the most efficient plan; its almost certainly better than the one
where the rogue gives up BS entirely, as the shaman can surely
take at least the occaisional whack without getting worried.
