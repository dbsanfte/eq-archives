OOC: I "quit" playing EverQuest years ago, just before RoK was released. I
recently got the bug again and decided to start playing again with my wife.
I bought her a new account with EQ Gold, but when installing on my machine
from my old CDs, I decided to check and see if my old account was still
around. Sure enough, there it was with all of my old characters intact.
