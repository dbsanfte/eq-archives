	I need not play the game myself to note a) what is written on the

	I cannot claim to be a *witness* to gameplay in DAoC, but one need not
witness an event to have a rational opinion of that event.  Or perhaps you
would care to argue that juries cannot possibly reach rational verdicts?

	It is mandatory in the sense that it is the intended endgame activity of
the game.  Avoiding it means you are going to get bored, fast.
