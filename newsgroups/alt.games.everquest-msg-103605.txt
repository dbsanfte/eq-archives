Thing is...  The begging part refers to the skill 'Beg' which you harass
NPCs for.  Who will either give you some cp or kill you on the spot.  For
us, however, we aren't allowed to kill players.  Not unless we are on a PvP
server, or trick you into dueling.

Questions are fine...  Some of us 'old ones' will respond.  We will even
direct you to 'offline' material, which is often better than trying to
spend the time to try and explain it online, mostly because it may entitle
you to mistakes, or worse yet, get us into trouble after we get frustrated
trying to explain it.  The thing is...  Some newbies go out of their way to
get one of us 'old ones' to give something in return when some of us have
struggled hard to get what we have now, and without the benefits of asking
people for nothing.
