Ok.  You are being petty.  "Deutch" was a typo, I know how to spell it.
Also you evidently do *not* speak German.  "sie" means either "you"
(formal), "they", or "she".  Actually that was another typo on my part, if
you're trying to say "you" (formal) it should be capitalized -- "und Sie
sind Scheiss!"  Speaking of which, "Schiess" was yet *another* typo on my
part, "schiess" means "shot", but "Scheiss" means "shit".  Ok, ok, I can't
type.  But *you* do not speak German or you would know that the word for
"he" is "er".  And it is a bit childish to bash me for mistypes to "prove"
that *I* don't speak German.  Actually it might surprise you to know that
I'm fluent.
