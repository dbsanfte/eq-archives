Unfortunately, it's still probably the best browser around. I've tried
Galleon (well, same as Moz anyway), Konqueror, Opera and others, and
frankly, they still make some glaring rendering errors, or suck in some
other way.

I'm probably behind the times, but my browser of choice in Linux is
still Netscape 4.x

Very good program, and I use it over Photoshop (not that I can afford
Photoshop for home use anyway) but depending on what you are doing with
it, you may need access to proprietary color spaces that haven't been
licensed for general use.
