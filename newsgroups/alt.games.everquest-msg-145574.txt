Given their history of web design at the station, I was pleasantly
shocked to find that the new manual is useful. They have the entire
index on one page, and the whole thing broken down into chapters and
individual sections, all linkable. The titles are fairly intuitive. If
you click on a chapter, it will open up another index page with the
individual section names, again linked. If you click on a specific
section from the main or sub indicies, it takes you right to that page.

As I said... surprisingly useful.
