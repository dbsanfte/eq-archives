I did a quick check at www.mwave.com and came up with this:

AMD ATHLON/SDRAM *Barebone System
1.44MB FDD
EPOX 8KTA3 PRO (Via KT133A Chipset, 1xAGP, 6xPCI, 1xISA, ATA100/66/33)
1.2Ghz Thunderbird CPU (AMD ATHLON 1200(266MHZ))
512MB PC133
ENLIGHT 7237/3 (ATX case with 300 Power-Supply)
$328.00USD

*Includes:
Motherboard 
Computer Case 
Floppy Drive 
Necessary cables, manuals, etc.
Heatsink/Cooling Fan 
Selected Amount of Memory (CAS3, unless specified otherwise) 
Selected Processor 

Just add the following and you are good to go:
HDD
CD-ROM
Video Card
Sound Card
Modem/Network Card

I do not work for MWAVE. They just happen to be my favorite online
store. I have never had a problem ordering from them, and their prices
are alwasy very good.

Cheers
