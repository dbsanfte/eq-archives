Well, you'd certainly need a 2nd video card, unless you plan on plugging the
2nd monitor into your sound card. :P

But, it seems that people have said that dual monitor systems dont work with
EQ, the second monitor just turns black. So, you still wouldnt be able to do
anything besides play gems. I'd make sure your idea will actually work
before I went out and bought the stuff. I've never tried it, so I cant
confirm anything, just figured you should know that it might not work.
