AHAHA yeah. Those people are not getting ports from me, ever. This is
asking someone else to endure more downtime because you are a
completely lazy bastard who won't make a journey that I can make on
any level one character in the game. I also see people in WC or EC
asking for ports to LS..... hello? 

This would be compareable to vendors having items which gave you a
89.99 xp res after you died for 20 plat, but you waited 3 hours in a
zone trying to get a level 49 90 percent or up xp res.
