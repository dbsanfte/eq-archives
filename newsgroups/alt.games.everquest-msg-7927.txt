My Troll warrior did some soloing (yes, a warrior soloing!) in the NE
corner of Overthere between 17 and 21, making around a yellow bubble
every 30 minutes.  That's where the mudpit is, with an indifferent con
Iksar vendor who sells arrows and bandages; bandages are absolutely
vital for a warrior.  This also raised my Bind Wounds from about 20 to
over 100.

It's a safe area - only the Sarnak will aggro, and as long as you keep
your eyes open, they're not too much trouble.  The zone to Warsliks is
nearby, and if disaster strikes and you die, it's a quick run back from
the outpost.  It's a sweet levelling spot, easily shared by several
people.
