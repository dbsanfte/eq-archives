}When your not nuking, get the hell out of AE range.  Depending where your

}hide from the AE.

There was a spot right by BW zone where we hid everyone but the kiting 
bard, the MA, and me until the time was right.  Apparently, it worked, but 
I was sitting in nexus by then.  Tashicide!  Wooot!

}How close were you guys getting?  Gore cheals, which can really mess a raid
}up.  Some methods for stopping the cheal...
}While the raid buffs and prepared, have a bard kiting Gore around.  Not only
}will this prevent gore accidently agroing, but she will be casting on the
}bard (who can stay out of melee range) and slowly but surely her mana gets
}lower.

Yup yup.

}Theft of thought.. a chanter spell (lvl 51?) that tseals mana from a mob...
}get a couple of chanters to cast this (it has a long recast)

ToT is good, if you're the tashicide chanter and have 4 seconds to live.  
Otherwise, Mana Sieve cycles much faster and is more effective.  I got off 
tash, ToT, and one sieve before Gore laid the smack down.  Felt pretty 
good about that. :)  Important:  Tashicide should be performed at a 
position approximately 20 feet in front of the MA so Gore doesn't run off 
to look for you and cause the dreaded pingpong effect.
