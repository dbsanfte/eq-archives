More what you get for posting last thing before going to bed when you have
barely slept for the past few days. ; )

I would have edited it and fixed it right after sending it, as you _had_
done exactly what I said you would, while not precisely using a circular
argument, but unfortunately thats not an option on usenet.  So I just left
it as is.

I left this out of the other response, as I'd really rather have an actual
discussion with you, then sit around trading insults. (1) But I felt later I
should probably say something to it.

See other response to your message for the real post.
