Well I'll tell you what I'd have already done, for damage control for 
Sony... (this assumes things are still down... actually I'd have already 
done it)

Upgrade all EQ2 accounts to All-Access for the next 30 days free... if 
they have another game it gives them something to do while the servers 
are down. If they don't have any other game registered to the EQ2 
account, give them the choice of a free EQ1 package thingy (what's that 
these days, Trilogy+pok+the bazaar area?), or their shooter 
(planetside?) with download link of course.

Go ahead and announce your free week, 2 weeks, or month (personally I'd 
go month... sure it's (100,000 accounts x $13 or so) 1.3 million in 
revenue, but Sony can afford little financial hiccups like that for some 
customer retention), do it NOW, in an email to all active accounts.
