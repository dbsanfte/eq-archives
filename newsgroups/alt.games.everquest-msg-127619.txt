Yeah, it is different. When one is being PLed, they have more powerful
heals being thrown at them and thus are able to take more of a beating
without dying. In a normal grouping situation, the heals being used
aren't as powerful because the healer is a similar level.

It takes more than HP to be an effective tank, though. HP is a big
part of tanking, but there's also damage mitigation. A warrior,
paladin, or Shadowknight is going to have far better AC (with far less
work finding the equipment) than a rogue usually. This means less
damage taken which means less work for the healer. Again, there are
exceptions. However, a "real" tank class with high AC is going to be
much more common than a rogue with high AC.

Perhaps, even though I don't see how that changes my statement. A
rogue is going to be working far below 100% against these mobs...
