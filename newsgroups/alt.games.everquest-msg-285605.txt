Theres plenty of group stuff in WOW, youve just got to sit around and find a 
group, same as EQ.
Oddly most people would sooner go out and solo and get xp now rather than 
spend time getting a group.

Theres not much difference if you play on a pve server. In fct the rp 
servers are probably a better community than EQ.

Is that the best criticism you can make?

WOW has boats. And gryphons. And trains. And zeppelins.

Ok so EQ wins. You dont have to wait a week for your corpse in WOW. (rolls 
eyes)

Yep trains and the ability to grief people are a real asset.

Yeah, no unique skills and abilities for any classes in WOW, they are all 
identical. (rolls eyes again)

Speaking of shamans, lets not mention their (close to) unique ability to rez 
themselves.

Yep, no brave people in WOW that would ever risk 3 hours trying to break new 
ground. We all know Blizzard publishes the strats for their bosses ahead of 
time so noone ever has to break new ground or develop new strategies.

If I had to make one general comment to you, Id say you should get some 
first hand knowledge of what youre talking about it before you try and 
review something. I could make some far more accurate criticisms of EQ, 
having played it for 5 years, but its all been said before.

Ill make one comment though. To keep playing the game without being "left 
behind" you dont have to buy a new "expansion" every 6 months in WOW.
