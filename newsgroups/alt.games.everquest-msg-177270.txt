you're forgetting about the +50 CHA, +10 STR/WIS/INT on a range slot item
(very nice for some people), and the fact that it summons 100% WR bags (also
nice for smiths with all that heavy ore), one of which you can hand to the
gnome in the bazaar and get a rentable one.

this was definitely worth it for my JCer enchanter (low STR and it pushed
both his INT and CHA into the high 220 range), but i haven't pursued it for
my baker and probably won't for my brewer either (yes, i know, i need to get
a *real* tradeskill under my belt).
