Well, last night we had 2 entrance bugs, then on a collection got to within
5 of goal...then no more drops, killed 15 mobs and no drop.

Then we did a slaughter.  Our typical group is a 52 warrior, 52 rogue, 51
cleric, 51 shaman, 53 druid, and either a 51 beastlord or a 50 ranger.  The
past few dungeons seem to have been bugged.  Supposedly, the dungeon is
instanced based on the abilities of your group, but like last night for
example we had a group of five on a slaughter.  The MObs were grouped so
close together, there was no way to pull with out getting 5 or 6 at a
time...WTF?  Anywho, rogue died twice, we had to evac twice, and ultimately
failed.  /sigh
