This isn't really even true at the levels most people will be at on
this discord server. Mob damage output doesn't scale exactly the same
way as hp does, and combined with the lower powered buffs enchanters
have plus the lower duration of charm itself, for a long time you
simply can't get enough milage out of a pet to make it particularly
worth it, and thats completely disregarding exp loss for deaths - it's
simply not good experience for quite a while.
