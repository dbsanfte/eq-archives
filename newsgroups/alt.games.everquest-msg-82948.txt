In the spirit of the thread dedicated to just how much of a sweetheart
bizbee is, I just wanted to make sure we had equal representation...that is,
from me (possibly others too! GASP!) who thinks he's just a loudmouthed
chump motherfucker.

Thanks for reading!

PS - Oh, and the 'but Drake, you suck 10x's worse...'  followup's  - save
it, I don't follow up these dumbass threads anyway.

I just want to make sure bizbee knows that *I* continually have my middle
finger extended in his general direction and don't see him for anything more
than the miserable fuck he is.
