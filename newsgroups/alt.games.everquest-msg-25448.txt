The manual has been posted several times before.  If you are in
possession of the information you are posting because you are or were a
guide then hopefully you have (not) provided (any) information which
will allow VI to trace this posting back to you such as same email
address, IP address etc.  If you have given them a method of determining
who you are I would anticipate your account being rightfully terminated
as posting this information is something you have agreed not to do.  If
you are/were not involved with the guide program and are posting this
information as well as your other comments in your post from a position
of ignorance, well then your position says it all.  As players
everything we need to know about guides and what they can do is provided
on the VI web site.  The only information beyond that which is posted on
the public site that can be gained from the guide manual is that which
would make a guide's life more difficult.  I'm sure they thank you for
your efforts and as a player who needs their help upon occasion I thank
you for helping to make them less efficient.
