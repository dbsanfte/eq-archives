Is there a way of modifying the game, or perhaps the tutorial, so that I can
explore Norrath without going online?  As a new player who doesn't know the
lay of the land, getting killed by spell-casting goblins after getting lost
in the Butcherblock mountains isn't exactly my cup of tea, so I'd like to
get an idea of where things are without killing my online character too
often.

Is this possible?

Paul
