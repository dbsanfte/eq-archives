I have trouble finding any *common* breastplate item that is as good
as the Tae Ew chain tunic, for the price you would pay.  The fungi is
nice of course, but you are starting to outgrow it for group
scenarios...some might argue anyway.

I cannot possibly justify the usual price difference between the LSoEE
and DL.  Just get the DL for your secondary.

There are several 2h weapons with better ratios, that sell for under
10k depending on server.  I would just look in the bazaar and filter
for price.  I can't say which ones would have serious level
requirement problems.  One advantage of the 2h route is obviously the
riposte problem.  One disadvantage is that if you do get your epic,
you will have this nifty haste item with +attack but you can't use it
with the often-times superior 2h option.  (Especially when good buffs
make the difference between 41% and 31% haste unimportant.)

This always pisses me off.

Start advertising to MQ the Swirling Sphere of Color.  You will
probably find someone, somewhere, with it in their bank.  Dont pay
more than 5k.

The Hole can be time consuming but one group can do it just fine.

VSR is a cakewalk.

The Jade Reaver is often times the toughest for people to get past. 
It takes a group or two, depending on level.  You could go through two
cycles or more at one sitting and get no JR's.  It is easy for people
to mess something up and ruin everyone's day.  (Fall off the bridge,
rogue disbands, etc...)  Also, in my experience, there will usually be
several Rangers and Druids helping out and they will also be rolling. 
Of course if you have the funds, this is sellable.

Rangers everywhere are looking for the PoH drop for Earthcaller. 
Don't count on finding it soon.
