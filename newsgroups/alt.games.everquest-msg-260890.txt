5) CORRUPTED EVERQUEST GAME FILES
Occasionally key files required for EverQuest to run will become
corrupted. You may want to delete the eqclient.ini, eqgfx_dx8.dll,
eqgraphicsdx9.dll, eqmain.dll, and eqgame.exe from your EverQuest
directory.  One or more of those files maybe corrupt, causing these
issues.
To locate your EverQuest directory:
Double Click the ?MY COMPUTER? icon
Double Click the ?C? drive (or the drive where you installed EverQuest)
Double Click the ?PROGRAM FILES? folder
Double Click to the installation of EverQuest (By default:
?SONY\EVERQUEST? or ?EVERQUEST?

Once you have located your EverQuest directory, please select, right
click and ?DELETE? each of the following files:
EQCLIENT.INI
EQMAIN.DLL
EQGFX_DX8.DLL
EQGRAPHICSDX9.DLL
EQGAME.EXE

If you only see the first part of the file name (ie. ?EQCLIENT? instead
of ?EQCLIENT.INI?) you should delete that file.just did it and im in!lee
