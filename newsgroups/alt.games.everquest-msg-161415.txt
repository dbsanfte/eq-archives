Junior, to my way of thinking, is a word specifically designed to indicate
someone's lack of maturity or self identity; naming your son after yourself,
whether with or without a different middle name, is indicative of your high self
opinion, lack of imagination, and strong desire to establish paternal dominance.

Dubya is certainly a victim of this form of opression, and seems (as do many
sons of prominent fathers) to vacilate between embracing his position and trying
to assert his individuality.

Failing, miserably.

I occaisionally call GHWBush's little boy George "junior" although I realize its
not completely correct... it just seems so fitting.  I rarely, however, hear
anyone "in the media" (a term slung out as though it refered to everyone in the
press, rather than merely those in the press who happen to disagree with your
views... surely Rush Limbaugh doesn't spend a lot of time referring to W as
Junior... ) making this misnomer, and if its not done in mockery as I do, then
their editors should be ashamed of themselves.
