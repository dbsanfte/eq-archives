Yes.

Some people will ALWAYS never have that time. In fact, most. Are we to
wait until all people have that time?

haven't seen this yet. example? Maybe a different game than EQ?

Depends.. is the timer somewhat random.. i.e. Stormfeather? Or does
the rare always pop after 15 hours? If the rare always pops after 15
hours.. then its more a half-hour to an hour camp. And if the rare
only drops no-drop stuff, it would be extremely hard to be profitable.
Rule of thumb.. if it takes 15 hours actually sitting there to camp a
spawn, it isn't that profitable. You have to remember you have monthly
costs for cable hookup, card access, and whatever else needed to get
up and running to pay for before it pays for itself.. and if you do it
full time as a job, factor in the room/food/car/car insurance and
whatever else you pay for a month before you see 'profit'.
