Maybe it's the class.   My rogue doesn't pull, and my warrior has never
needed magic resist.  (Warriors get an automatic MR bonus just for
levelling.)  The only time I've actively sought out resists, other than
raids with AE's of course, is when I was fighting mobs that would repeatedly
attempt to slow me.

I'd usually rather have one there than not as well, unless they're an idiot.
But it's no longer essential like it used to be.
