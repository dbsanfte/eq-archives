I logged my baby SK in for the first time in a long while 2 nights ago,
around 1AM.  He immediately fell to his death for 10000 damage in Neriak
Commons.  I petitioned, no response after waiting for 90 minutes, during
which time I went out, killed a skellie for his rusty weapon, and proceeded
to get xp killing blues.  Camped out.  Next time I logged in, petitioned
again, 5 minutes later, I had a CS res.  Corpse was under the world
somewhere, and not summonable by me.  I wasn't terribly surprised to get no
response at 1AM, I was actually shocked to get  a response within 5 minutes
in the morning.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  given that he was
level 6, and had no twink gear on him, I was not terribly concerned, but it
speaks well of the possibility of such service if I should need it with one
of my other characters.
