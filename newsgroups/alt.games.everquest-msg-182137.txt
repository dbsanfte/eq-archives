Why, Thank You.  I resemble that remark.

I kind of like those games where your map is blank until you have explored
the area.  You  don't have to trod over every square inch, but what you can
see, appears on your map.  I can't remember the game, but the cartography
skill got better as you used it more.  Means you still have to explore to
create your map, but once you've done it, you don't have to remember every
square inch.  I'm still ambivalent about the map automatically marking your
spot on the map.  I would have preferred something where you have to press a
button on the map window, simulating concentrating on the map (perhaps
activating the maps location spell), for it to temporarily show your
position (until you move).  Keeps you from getting lost, but too
inconvenient to constantly follow along.

But hey, they didn't ask me, so I'll live with what they put in.

Cheers,
Eric
