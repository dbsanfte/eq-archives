I'll try the tower again, but last time I tried everything was QUICKLY
replaced with greater skeletons, BIG RED NASTYS!
And when I did /who to see who I could group with....well there was my pet.
Seams everybody else didn't like that tower either. I'll try again though,
this time on a weekend and afternoon, hopefully more people in there.
