    It's a single fight. Compare with how many such fights you need to do
for a warrior epic. Agreed on the rarity, but is he any rarer than Sev? We
just had a big flare-up on our server boards over Sev. Seems the local
manaburn team is taking him down within five minutes of pop, and won't back
off unless your raid (which must have more people in zone than they do)
sends them a /tell that you're camping it.

    Ranger axe, 10/19 and a nice chunk of HPs, Toxiferous, spider in the
maze. If you can gather the troops to do the gnome quest, end-game level HP
earrings. If you want to lure them, make a listing of what drops and where
using Allakhazam's as your resource. Then plan out what places to hit, using
experience as a guide as to what you can handle. (eg. the mudbowl/silver
temple area will likely kill your raid)
