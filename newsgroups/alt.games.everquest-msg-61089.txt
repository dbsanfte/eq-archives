Well... If you stumble into the Dark Elf camp... you have your
dispellers, your nukers and your harm touchers, all in one
convenient location. Of course, those are up both day and night,
and are off the beaten path to boot. But I'm pretty sure they'd
drop me right quick if I paid them a visit. Last time I helped
a guildie with the Freebringer, I lasted all of two seconds
after General V'Gheir(sp?) summoned me... 500HP life tap, and
hits for 225 or so...

As for the undeads, if you get a couple of them at once, their
HTs could probably drop an unbuffed 50+ fast enough ;)

Also, I bet it's not that hard to find a 50+ who doesn't have
J or T boots.
