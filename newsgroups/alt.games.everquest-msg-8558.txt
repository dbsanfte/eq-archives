Has anyone noticed any pathing problems with the orc camp in EW?

I was pulling there the other day, sticking to singles as we only had a
group of 4 and really need a full group to take on multiple pulls. All of a
sudden I am aggro'd (from nowhere) by the chief, pull him and we manage to
kill and loot him, then wait for the inevitable avengers and corpse
retrieval...doesn't happen, phwew..
Every med's and heals and I argue with the Druid insisting she rolls for the
Battlemail, which she eventually does and wins it (hardly seems fair that
she doesn't roll, I wasn't going to wear it, only sell it, my conscience
just cost me 1500pp :�)) Then we are ready I go to pull, get inside camp and
again, without firing a shot I am agg'd this time by an elite, from nowhere,
run him back to group and kill him...I'm looking good as the puller, all
these high singles. I get halfway to camp gates and 3 elites spawn on top of
me (like WTF?) and I stupidly pull them back to group was hoping a group mez
will sort them out and we can deal with one at a time, for whatever reason
it doesn't (I believe our chanter was sleeping on the job, to tell the
truth) and we all die...should really have zoned them, there was far to much
there, even with a mez, for us to deal with.
Anyone else had similar experiences with orcs spawning from nowhere? was
this orcs stuck in rooms or other obstacles that should really have come
with the Chief, hence the elite I got next. Any ideas how to avoid this and
if I was doing anything wrong?

Back to one bubble of exp into 40, lol, will I ever make that second gold
:�)
