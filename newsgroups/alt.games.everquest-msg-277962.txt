Not anytime soon, no. My guess is that if they'd thought it was
worthwhile to try with EQ1, they would have tried to roll it out there
instead of in EQ2. ... but that's just a guess, it wouldn't surprise
me if they did try it. 

I guess the reason that wouldn't preclude me from returning to EQ is
because I don't really have to invest anything in the game at this
point since my characters already made it to high levels before I
retired them. In EQ2, if I'm going to invest that kind of time and
money in a new (for me) game, I'd need to have some faith in the
company.
