/agree.  I think what's far more likely is that race/religion/class
give a particular character -1000 (for instance) as a starting point,
and then he can go +/- 2000 from there using "deeds".  That would be
a lot simpler to implement than having a certain race/religion/class
start out with non-zero faction with certain groups.
