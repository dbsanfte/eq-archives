I feel that I have earned my items thus far. I've only been playing for about
two weeks, and am only level 14. I do have a pretty nice sword that someone
gave to me while I was in Greater F. I didn't beg, ask, or even hint around to
needing a better sword.  Me and him teamed up in CB, killed some  Orc
Centurions, Orc Trainers, etc... and we did so for well over an hour and a
half. He comes out of nowhere before he's getting ready to log and says, "I
like your playing style, come to me with the bank because I have something to
give you." 

 I'm like sure, cool! He was playing a level 8 or 9 at the time I was teaming
with him, and come to find out he had a level 40 as well. He gave me a sword of
Xarnon (or something like that, not for sure if that's the exact spelling)
Anyways, it has 23 dmg, +3 str, and +5 stamina. I don't know how good of a
sword that is compared to you all, but for being a low leveler like me, I was
impressed. I took it to a merchant and tested to see how much it would sell
for, and they offered around 80 plat + some gold, silver. So, I'm sure it would
cost ALOT more than that, if you could actually buy it. I'm guessing it was
found as loot, I dunno.

 The whole moral of the story is, I never once asked for anything, and most
people helped me when they saw fit. Did plenty of groupings, and alot of people
were nice.

     I have met a few people that have been jerk offs, but that's expected in
this game, much less everywhere in this world.

        I'm a newbie, and not all of us are like that. To me, begging not only
makes you look pathetic, but it's NO fun even if you do  get what you want.
I've asked for a SOW one time when I did a corpse run, but not anything else. 

      ....and I'm gonna continue to get my stuff the hard way... the FUN way
:o)
