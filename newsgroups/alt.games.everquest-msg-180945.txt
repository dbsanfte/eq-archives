While I agree with most all of your points (you missed the
Casinos, or maybe they haven't made it to your server yet).
The 1 plat undercutters are what kills me.  I'm not going to
buy something for 12999 instead of 13000 just because
I'll save 1 plat.  If you're going to discount and item, make
it a discount worth my time!  I go out of my way not to
buy from them if I can help it.
