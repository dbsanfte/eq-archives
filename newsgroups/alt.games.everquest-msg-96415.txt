A little off topic(although I think the half elves look bad too), but the
first time I logged in with Luclin I was horrified to see that my formerly
evil looking troll now looked like Spock's grandfather.  Troll models off,
and staying off!
I hate nearly all of the run animations too.  IMO everyone in norrath runs
like they are experiencing some severe gastro-intestinal distress.
Otherwise they look.....they look........
Well, all the models look stupid to me.  Just my opinion again.
Except dwarves.  They look alright.
And

Uh

No, that's about it I guess.
