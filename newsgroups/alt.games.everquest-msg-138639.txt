Well, if the person is done with the zone and just wants to get a res and
leave, he could try having a Wizard or Druid port him out as soon as he
finishes looting, or have a Wizard translocate him.

Along those same lines, but more risky...get res, loot corpse, equip that
hammer that procs a gate to OT, and start attacking something (or duel
someone), and hope you get a proc before you suffocate. :-)
