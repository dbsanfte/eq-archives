I sat for the Fabled journeyman boots for the specific reason of a
targatable sow.
I sat for 33+ hours before receiving mine.
At the time I received the item, I checked Test server to see if any planed
changes was in the works.
Test still had SOW, therefore I beleived my regular server would not of been
changed.

The whole reason for me to do this quest was for the target sow.
I would not be so upset if they changed the boots to click Run4 (or whatever
the effect was changed to), if they still we're a targetable effect.
but totally making it self only (after the fact) has made me extremely upset
to the point where I am considering leaving EQ after 5 years.

Yes, they dropped the ball on this one. I contacted most people that I sat
through the Drelzna camp with,
and 21 of the 63 people have already canceled there accounts and everyone is
level 65.

I am loosing online friends who are quitting because of this and that's
gotten me more upset then the fact of the nerf.
Players on Saryrn are upset as I am also, and even more so.

My new toy was never broken, SOE sold me a Dud.

Assuming things will be nerfed is also another matter upsetting me. Can't
they make a descision before implementing it.
Isn't there a test server for that specific reason????

This should never of happened and shows that SOE is inconsiderate and unable
to make descisions prior to affecting it' player base.

In other words --- it shows bad management on SOE's part when it comes to
implementing items in game.

I'm just going to quit here, before I start rambling on about the crap SOE's
been doing since day1.

It's not the game that has me addicted, it's the friends I have online, and
when they start leaving, what's to keep me there???
