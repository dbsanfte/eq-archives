Since we're going on about all the other race/classes that get asked.  Last
night
I'm camping the Throne Room in CB for faction.  Up comes a level 11
Wood Elf Druid of all things and asks for SoW.  I am not anon, sitting there
with old Jobobber right next to me.  Human necro in bright purple full suit
of
Flayed Skin, and a Druid asks me.  I literally could not answer this person,
I
was way too amused.  We were the only 2 people in the zone too so it's not
as if it would have been too hard to see that I was a necro.

Player of many.
