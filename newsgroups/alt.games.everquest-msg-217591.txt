I had an amazingly fun time yesterday, with a group composed of a paladin,
bard, three beastlords (all 65) and me, a 63 shaman. I was to be the main
healer, which finally gave me a chance to try out the L62 heal.

I went in without any kind of mind candy, fully expecting the worst. We
agreed that the BSTs would use their 65 percent slow, leaving me to heal,
buff and haste. As it happened the pets mauled the mobs effortlessly, and I
ended up with enough mana to try and raise my evocation skill with plenty of
rains and nukes. :)

We completed the 'slaughter 54 in Mistmoore' mission in around 45 minutes,
then, as it went so well, did a collection mission in Miragul's, finishing
after 40 minutes.

And finally, the sight of three BST warders, 4 shaman pets (thanks to Spirit
Call), plus a 'confused mutation', I think it was, all beating on a hapless
mob was amazing. I've *never* seen LDoN mobs die so quickly!
