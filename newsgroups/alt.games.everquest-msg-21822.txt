Some overall thoughts on the raid..

Yeah, I wasn't exactly "effective" at 46.. but since I'm melee I was landing
hits on the mobs. I didn't need all that much healing because I hardly ever
got aggro. If my guild had been going for a raid with 36 people, I might
have been a waste of a group slot.. but last night it was fine.

Hate wasn't all that different from a regular zone.. it looked like a seedy
city. The mobs were similar to other ones I had seen for the most part. Ones
that looked like zombies, mummies, spectres, goblins and then more unique
looking ones (ashenbone drake, abhorrent). Aggro was nutty though. Getting
punched for 227dmg was interesting. I'm sure lots of spellcasting was going
on, but I had spell effects turned off. You definitely have to be organized
when leading one of these raids. I can see how corpse retrievals could get
really ugly.

I kinda wish some monk items dropped - but then again, not every class got
something anyhow. I'm going to Fear in two weeks, so that should be better
(even though I know that Shiverback isn't great). One of my groupmates gave
me a Cane of Harmony, so I actually did get some nice loot!

I'm glad I put in the time to get to 46.. I had a great time. I'll do more
raids for sure.. as long as they are on the weekend!  Raiding may not be for
everyone.. but I enjoyed it. My guild does do quite a few raids, but they
also work on epics, and help out the lower level people like myself. I don't
really see a downside to a little foray into the planes.. just another
dimension to the game.
