Not necessarily. I mean, why couldn't it execute a preprogrammed option to do what
you were gonna do, i.e. run to nearest zone at 2 bubbles of heath? You would still
be there for 30 sec. and the mobs would still have the opportunity to kill you as
you ran. . .  If you were going to die, they would still kill you. It's not like
making the AI a bit smarter is really gonna save your tacos if you are truly
overextended. The problem is not that you die if you go LD, it's that the AI makes
such dumb choices for what a character would actually do in a given situation.
Melee seems to be the most likely option it chooses, which is just peachy if you're
a tank or semi-tank class; but how many healer/caster classes are actually going to
try to melee a solo kill to death once they're past 15-20 at most? Why can't the AI
be programed to at least select a likely course of action for you to take based on
your class and level when you're LD, instead of the stupid ones it chooses now?
Sure, sometimes you'd still come back dead; but at least the odds would be better.
