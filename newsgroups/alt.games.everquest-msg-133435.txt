Velious textures are broken with the luclin models. Verant has no
intention of redoing them for the luclin models. They know it would
take time and slow the average player down too much what with loading
the regular luclin model textures AND special velious ones.

You should have looked on the official forums, this is a known issue.
Only a couple velious textures look right on luclin models, like
rygorr legs on a dark elf female.. but they look horribly AWFUL
because they ARE THE SAME TEXTURE. Its kind of hard to explain without
seeing it. You ever stuck your head in one of those painted sailor or
pirate guys with the hole for your face and your GF sticks her head in
the one of the mermaid or something then somone takes a picture? That
is kind of what the velious chain legs look like on a luclin model
because the pallette is way too bright and garish and cartoony for
them. So they'd even have to rework the couple textures that fit the
model for them to look right.


>PS. When I bought the coif and put it on, the player who sold it to me said

He must have old models, velious textures only work on old models.

Well, it would look broken since there is no velious texture for
luclin models. You are stuck with the luclin chain textures. I really
like the luclin chain textures on my dark elf female.. for a long time
I did not know they were NOT the velious textures, since they look so
cool!

This setting also totally breaks vah shir characters with any velious
gear since of course the vah shir models had NO velious textures EVER.
I enabled it as you did and my vah shir had 4 different colors of fur
and was naked.
