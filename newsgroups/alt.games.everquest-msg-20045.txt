Hi everyone ... as I work my way through level 22 in High Hold Keep, I would
like to start focusing my buying efforts on + wis items (wouldn't mind
getting them the old fashioned way either from hunting them down so feel
free to point me in the right direction on that front as well).

At any rate, my high elf is outfitted in mostly bronze armour head to toe
with a few exceptions which all add to various stats but nothing on the
wisdom front.  On the jewellery front, I have two orc fang earrings, two
jagged bands, and a black iron medallion (this being my only +wis item right
now as I focussed earlier in getting +str items to support the armour I
was/am wearing).

I do have all my 24 spells purchased and waiting in the bank so I only have
about 30 pp right now.  So outside of the BS tunic I want to save for
(someone was selling one in HHK the other nite on my server for 150 pp
compared to the 300 I see it go for usually - where is money when you need
it?), I am really not sure what I should be looking for or hunting for.

Any ideas for items that maybe are in the 100 - 200 pp/each  range that I
should be looking to acquire over the next few levels?  I think that is a
reasonable price range given my playing style.  Either lighter weight armour
in some slots that can get me away from some of the +str requirements I have
now and/or +wis items that can get me heading up in the right direction
there.  Or places I can hunt for these items at my level?

Also, I am using a Velium Morning Star right now along with a Small Targ
Shield.  Any items that would be +wis there that I should go for would also
be of interest.

Thanks for any and all advice!
