Would all of the African Americans please go back to Africa... not forever,
just for a month or two, just to see how much you want to be proud of it...
oh, and see how Africans feel about Americans.

Would all of the "Asian Americans" please go back to asia for a little
while... Mexican Americans get out too...

Everyone who wants to be an American may stay...

I don't care what colour your skin is, what god you worship, what holiday
you celebrate, nor even what country threw your great great grandparents
into a bathtub and said "swim."

America is (supposed to be) a salad bowl (or melting pot for those that
remember when School House Rock was allowed to air the "America Rock"
segments).  America is the greatest most powerful nation in the history of
the planet because it is (ultimately) made up of all the little bits and
pieces of the rest of the world.

Trying to segregate yourselves into groups, or abide by special rules
because of birth heritage, is, simply racist.  Look back in history, and you
will see that every catastrophic, oppressive, racist movement has started by
classifying people into as small a group as possible.

My father had a saying he used to tell me:

"You know what an African American, an Asian American, an Indian American,
an Arab American, and a Mexican American all have in common?"

"They're neither."

I have a saying:

"Used to be you could always tell where someone was from by their name."

"Juan Chavez-Tanaka is an American."

From "Stripes":  (I'll have mangled this quote, but you know the scene)

"We're not just soldiers... we're AMERICAN soldiers.  We're here because our
ancestors were thrown out of every self-respecting country in the world.
We're mutts! ... look, his nose is cold.  Who saw 'Ol' Yeller?'  Who didn't
cry at the end?  Everyone... I know I did.  Why?  Everyone loves a mutt."

Sorry for my ramble and rant.  I am just entirely fed up with state
sponsered and endorced racism (political correctness is racism pure and
simple), and even more fed up with the people who try to segregate Americans
dividing this my country.

I am a mutt.

I am an American.

My ancestors came from everywhere... and I have a rich history of
oppression, and culture, and traditions that I can look to... but I am
nothing if I do not look to a future of continuously learning.

Oh, and you can call me a "European American" the day that you pry my cold
dead fingers from your larynx, and drop my body onto the mountain of corpses
that I will have left in my wake to defend this one nation from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.  I have been to Europe, I am not a "European American"
any more than I am a "Native American" or an "Asian American" or an "African
American."

When the census taker came to my door, and looked at me because I refused to
send in the Racial Profileing Form, and asked me my race, I said "U. S.
Citizen."  She said "that's not an acceptable answer."  Then I reminded her,
"in that case it is unlawful for you to even ask."
