Conjurer? Yeah, Everyone seems to be affectionate. I'd have a hard time
not being a ranger ;) Swashbuckler though. Mmmmmm. MMmmmmmm. ;)

I think the defensive/offensive split is a viable interpretation too, but
the 'offensive' classes all seem to have a much darker feel to them...

Defiler vs Mystic, Inquisitor vs Templar, Shadowknight vs Paladin, Thug vs Monk,
Assassin vs Ranger, etc.
