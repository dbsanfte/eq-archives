I don't think I've ever been snared/rooted while running with Selos.  I 
know that originally if you had Selos up and got snared/rooted it would 
break the next time the song pulsed.  I've just assumed that it is still 
that way, though now that I think on it I do remember some tweak to that 
about 18 months ago.
I wasn't always a high-level, I did my first 18 months getting to 50, and 
the past year getting to 60.  I do remember running through FV when every 
one of those spiders was blue or better to me.  (I also remember running 
with a spider chasing me right to the guards, who killed me because I was 
in dark elf guise.)
