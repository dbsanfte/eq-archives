One experience I had still makes me laugh (sort of).  My main is a WIZ
and at the time was about level 25 or so.  I was playing with a friend
so for a while it was just the two of us .  Another player came along
and wanted to group with us.  Fine we invited him in.  My friend is a
monk so he didn't want any loot just experience.  The new addition to
our group said he could pull. OK, off we go...
He was looting corpses before they hit the ground.  Reminded him for
second time to turn split off in consideration of the monk.  Mentioned
looting and he continued to loot in his way untill he turned to me...
the wiz, and asked if I could pull because he was encumbered!
My friend and I decided to log for the night.

Bottom line, never be timid in asking about looting in pickup groups.
Fair is fair and you are entitled to share for the effort you put into
the group.  Don't be afraid to leave a group if things aren't working.
It's a game and should be fun for everyone in the group.
