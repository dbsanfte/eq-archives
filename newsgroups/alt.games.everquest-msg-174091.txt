Ben?  Mr. Gradeschool Taunter?

You're regressing, Ben.  In a few more posts I'll likely have
to change your diapers.  Come to think of it, I'm dealing with
the same type of cleanup now.


>You're not qualified to even comment anymore until you inform

Nice try, but you can't make me go away just by covering
your eyes and wishing hard enough, or even making silly taunts.

I see that rather than making your own arguments, you've
resorted already to the old "cut-and-paste a flood of
semi-relevant paragraphs from various sources and hope
they make a case by sheer volume."

Unfortunately, they actually contradict the point you
were trying to argue.

That point, since you've forgotten it so quickly (do try
to stay on track) was:

#   when the usefulness of the Kurds
#   was at an end for propoganda purposes, their issues
#   were dropped like a dirty rag, never to be heard
#   from again

In alleged "support" of this point you did a coredump of
random paragraphs concerning the failed 1996 attempt of
the Clinton administration to help the Kurds revolt
against Saddam.

Admittedly it went off about as well as the Bay of Pigs,
and I'm not about to try to defend Clinton's incompetence
(quite the contrary, I'd be glad to pile on and say,
"yup, that's typical Clinton").

But the funny part here is that you tried to provide
this trip down memory lane as an example of how the
US allegedly "dropped their issues like a dirty rag,
never to be heard from again" after 1990-91.

Um, Ben?  Just how does our trying to help the Kurds
(no matter how incompetently) in 1996 support your
point that their issues were "never to be heard from
again"?  Even a fucked-up attempt to help is proof
that they were *not* "never to be heard from again".

Before you offer any more evidence, make sure it
actually *supports* your point instead of undercuts it.

Similarly, an attempt to assist Kurdish rebels in
1972 is a) further proof that contrary to your claim
we don't ignore them, and b) irrelevant to your claim
that we "never heard of it again" after 1990-91 (unless
you have a time machine you haven't told us about).

Finally, the failed 91 coup was handled in an
inexcusable way, but you can hardly offer it as
evidence for your assertion that we "never heard of it
again" *after* 91.

Stay focused, Ben, it'll help you make actual
arguments instead of stream-of-consciousness posts.


>Yeah. I'm sure they're REAL happy for that no fly zone. Bestest
>friends with the US, mm hmm.

Switching the subject again, Ben?  I never said they
were necessarily our biggest fans, Ben, so take that
straw man elsewhere.

I *did* point out that the no-fly zones to protect
the Kurds/Shiites, and our public promises to support them,
torpedo your ridiculous and false assertion that
after 91 we've forgotten all about the Kurds.

You made a stupid, false statement.  Deal with it like
a man, instead of reverting to grade school:

>Dan? Mr. Oil Man?

Grow up, Ben.  If you can.


>You know nothing about what's going on. Zilch.

Uh huh...  Ben, *I* wasn't the one who managed to
forget about ten years of no-fly zones when he
made a bone-headed remark about us supposedly
forgetting about the Kurds "never to be heard
from again".

*I* was the one who "knows about what's going on"
well enough to point out your mistake.

Then you came along and provided documentation
of *further* assistance to the Kurds in a weird
attempt to "prove" that we had forgotten about
them.  Ben, if you must drink, don't post.

Tell you what, Ben -- if you stop lying about me,
I'll stop telling the truth about you.
