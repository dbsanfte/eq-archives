I never did run it, I think there was a tutorial when I got my copy of EQ
last august but I never used it.  There's a new tutorial on the net, had to
download it and it's big!  Anyway, I was curious so I ran that one
time...nothing like playing the game...very simplistic, it does tell you to
buy food and turn in your newbie letter but it's set up to buy food one at a
time, thought that was funny.  I felt it was over too fast, that a true
newbie would still be lost when he started playing for real.
