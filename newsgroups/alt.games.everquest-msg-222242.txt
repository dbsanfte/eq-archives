Because we're social animals, and the cornerstone of our society is that 
we do not kill each other without a very good reason indeed. If we did, 
we'd still be somewhere under the sabertooth tiger in the food chain. 
Those who kill for no reason, or for a wrong reason, are acting against 
mankind as a whole, and therefore in the "wrong" in the primordial sense.

And before you ask, the only "right" reason I can think of right now is 
to immediately prevent your own death, or the deaths of others.
