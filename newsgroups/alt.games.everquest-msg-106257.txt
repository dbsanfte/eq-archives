It wasn't my math which was incorrect, it was which elements I was deciding
to apply (although I admit I didn't know how to represent the formula I was
trying to communicate).  In so doing, I applied a damage range of 1-12 to
represent the 20% increase in iterations (12) which is where the real error
occurred.  Once I corrected it back just a 1-10 damage range and 12
iterations, I realized it truly WAS a simple 20% increase in both haste and
damage output.

Interesting comment you made about insulting me.  I never accused you of it,
but you are defending yourself of exactly that.

I learned three things from all this.  One, how haste works in EverQuest.
You can guess the other two, as I can see you're pretty good as reading my
mind.
