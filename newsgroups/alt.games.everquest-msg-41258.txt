Well folks, I'd expect to see an emergency patch sometime very soon.

It appears that the new and improved stacking shaman epic weapon is broken.
It does no damage to anything it is targeted on.

Thats not even the best part though... the best part is how they broke it.
The Shaman Epic no longer does a 1200 point DoT over 2 minutes...  it now does
a 1200 point Heal over two minutes. ( Oops. ; ) )  Since the game still thinks
it's a DoT, you can only target it on yourself or a mob (generally not a good
idea *grin*) but our Shaman tonight was loving it.   He speared himself and
then began cannibalizing as fast as he could.  Damn near infinite mana, and he
never fell below 90 percent full of hit points.

So, enjoy it while you can, cause I'm sure it'll be gone within a day. ; )
