If you want to become a Trader you must 1> constantly watch prices on all
merchandise. 2> have some spending capital that can sit in goods for a week
or two. 3> Be willing to leave your computer on and your Trader online when
not playing.
example last night I saw a Fungi going for 59,000 Normally 70k bought it and
sold it over night for 65k.
If you are trying to transfer cash between characters on a single account I
would suggest buying Gems with a cha of 125 or greater you will lose around
5% on each gem.
