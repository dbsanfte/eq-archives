Agreed - as in another post, a d00d lost the name "Cmen" (semen) a couple of
weeks ago.

I'm also pretty open-minded, but I'm aware that just because "that stuff's
out there" doesn't mean that we need to perpetuate it.  I know that teenage
boys play, I know that some teenage girls play - they don't need to be
exposed to that.
I, personally, would have less of a problem with "Lusafir" than some might,
but to each his own.  If the name is offensive and you can provide rational
cause - petition it.  I see a ton of dumb names that are just plain dumb.  I
leave those alone; too many to bother with.  Offensive names, or ones that I
feel violate the nature of the game, I will consider petitioning.
