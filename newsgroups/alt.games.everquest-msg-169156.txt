Sometimes a computer will notice when you press one of your
"shift" keys (or "alt" or "ctrl"), but not notice when you
release it.  The symptoms you're getting sound like what
you would get if it thought your shift key was still pressed
(since shift-uparrow, etc., scroll through your chat commands).

When this happens next, try pressing and releasing your left
shift key, then your right shift key.  Your computer will notice
each being released and this should cure the problem.

Any time you get odd keyboard behavior, it's a good idea to
press/release all of your shift/alt/ctrl keys once.  And this
doesn't just happen in EQ, I've had it happen in many apps.
