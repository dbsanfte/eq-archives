No Shit, there I was at the Freeport Docks (don't all good stories start
out that way?) at about 3:30 am local real world time.

I was just completing the LS pouch/broken pole quest before logging for
the night.  And there's a dwarf paladin standing at the docks fishing.

As I hand in the broken pole the paladin start to talk to me.  Not, "GIVE
SOW," or "PORT ME NOW!" like I'd been hearing all night, but, "How
has your evening been?" and just casual conversation.  Didn't demand
anything, didn't want anything more than someone to talk to.

Turns out the boat were running *really* late, and he needed to go back
to his home city, because the local paladin guild didn't like him.

I told him that I could travel with him, and invited him to group with me.
He joined and I told him that I just needed to memorize the correct spell.

He told me that he'd keep watch for the boat.  I didn't realize that he
didn't understand that I was going to port us to Butcherblock.  

I memorized the port and fired it off.

As the boat arived.

As my friend jumped onto the boat.

From his perspective, he leaped onto the boat and zoned into butcherblock.
He was slightly freaked out.  

We both laughed about it once I explained what happened.

He'd never been to the Druids' circle in BB before, so I dropped SOW on 
him and took him back to the city gates.

I thanked him for a fun end of the evening story and logged out.

With all the the beggers it is really nice to run into someone who
didn't demand transportation services.

Matt
