You won't be able to pull all of them solo even at 65, at least I've
never seen it done (although admittedly we didn't try very hard). You
can fight the first one solo, but the 2nd one (after you enter the
building and do a U-turn) appears to be linked with one of the 3 in
the next room. I also don't think you'll be able to split the next two
in the 2nd room or the first two upstairs. 

Strangely enough, if you jump down to the highborns, those can be
single pulled with ease even though they're higher lvl. 

Luck on the haste belt, PH is the revenant on the first floor if you
didn't know.
