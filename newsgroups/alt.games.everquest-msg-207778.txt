Paladin and Druid would be great if Druid had slow spells.

Unfortunately they dont and if you want to take this combo to 65
and gain hundreds of AAs your hunting grounds will end up in
PoP zones.  In PoP slow is a requirement unless you want to waste
a lot of mana.  With that in mind, that leaves two choices for you.

Enchanter and Shaman.  I prefer Enchanter, you will have everything
but snare.

Hope this helps.
