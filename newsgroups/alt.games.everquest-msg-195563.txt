You may already have brought this up, but there is also the question of
whether you want to forgo the JBB.  Shaman damage output has a very poor
damage to mana ratio.  The only saving grace in this is the combo of an
epic and JBB, though at a certain point even the JBB trails off in
usefullness. But still...mana free nukes are not to be scoffed at, despite
what many proud iksar shaman will say.  I do respect their sacrifice. ;)

Troll shaman really are the golden children of the bunch...regen, no
restrictions in using the two most useful pre-60 items (fungi tunic and
JBB), snare necklace, and I believe they are not restricted from the iksar
cudgels with enough work (barbarians are, I believe, due to their
good-aligned deity).  Oh, and their stats...any shaman who isn't just a
shadr00d knows that hitpoints matter more than wisdom. Only downsides are
xp penalty, faction (not sure hwo much it really matters, not having been
a troll...well, I was accused of being once on xevserver.com), and that
funky smell you can never wash out of your armor.

Personally I prefer Vah Shir shamans, but that's because I like my husband
playing a sexy race.  :)
