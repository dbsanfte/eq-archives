Bitch about this zone is it has a lot of one-way drop offs.
Meaning that once you go past a certain point you have to
fight your way back around a different way to get to the exit.
But if you have a druid with you gating out should not be a problem.
You could do the entrance with 2 people but like all dungeons the
more you have the safer you will be.

Get a good map that place is a maze.
