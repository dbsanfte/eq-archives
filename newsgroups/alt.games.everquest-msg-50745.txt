I will have to try that, been tempted to try it in fp, but the guards
there are so wussy around the pod, i am afraid he will slice through
them like a warm knife through butter, and then come after me.

Hmmm I think I just found my new mission in EQ, ways to kill the pod in
each city.  ought to be fairly easy in ogguk, charm an armadillo...

I am not sure where the pod is in Grobb, will have to look into that
one.  hmmm not sure there are animals in Cabilis, but also not sure i
want the faction nightmare just to try to kill the pod.  

The Mission begins today heheh
