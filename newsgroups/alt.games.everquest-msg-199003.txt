I have yet to have this proven to me, perhaps I'm being dumb.

I seem to generate more hate, and seem to hold mob aggro better, using a
2HS weapon (widebladed greatsword, 35/35), than a Lammy (9/19) and Jade
Mace (9/18).

Where am I 'going wrong'?

Is it because the quick weapons aren't generally as up-to-date as the 2HS?

All weapon skills are maxed, and warrior is 52nd level (so the widebladed
greatsword isn't quite 35/35 yet).

Why do faster weapons generate more hate (that's a serious question, what
is the mechanic that causes it ....)?

Totally agree with that, 2HB is a bitch though :(
