Well, Griffenes are mid 20s, Griffins are low 30s, Griffons are high
30s. Sabretooths in Ill Omen are high teens to low 20s, but the ones in
Overthere go up to mid 30s, where there are also Kunark rhinos (mid
30s), etc. In Velious, you have snow cougars around 30, Snow Griffins
(high 30s), elder Snow Griffins (low 40s), plus wooly rhinos, woolly and
tundra mammoths, tundra kodiaks, etc. I'd say if you were really
unadventurous you could pretty much do nothing but fear and charm kite
up into the 40s or so, at least...
