Yay more patch to fix what the last patch broke... and a revamped
Innothule Swamp

 *** Highlights ***

- Innothule Swamp Revamp: As the stench of evil pullulates throughout
the region surrounding the home of the trolls, the denizens of the
Innothule Swamp surface to see the rejuvenated swamplands.

- SOE Fan Faire: The 2007 Vegas Fan Faire from August 2nd-5th is
approaching. Online registration is now closed, but we've still got
plenty of room for walk-ins! Walk-in Registration will begin at the
Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino on Thursday, August 2nd at 4:00pm. Visit
http://events.station.sony.com/fanfaire for more information.

- SOE Block Party: We invite you to join the SOE team in San Diego on
July 28th for the second annual SOE Block Party. Visit
http://eqplayers.station.sony.com for details.


*** Items ***

- All items that have a clickable aura now have a cast time of .5
seconds.
- Changed the 2 avoidance to 2 DoT shielding for Buckler of
Corruption.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Changed the names of Sacred Stone I and Sacred Stone II to The
Kobold Hearthstone and The Stone-fed Shaman respectively.
- Gnashclaw Stonefed will not become "active" until a player on the
"The Stone-fed Shaman" quest gets into the area of the orc fort. This
should help prevent him from being killed by folks that are not on the
quest.
- Gnashclaw's aura now makes the orcs near him a bit tougher, so
beware the Stone-fed shaman.


*** Spells ***

- Sorcerer's Spell Guard now has its hit limit reinstated.
- Less powerful pet focus effects should no longer override more
powerful pet focus effects.
- Sporali Advisor should no longer be overwritten by Malo.


*** Tradeskills ***

- It seems that the gnomes made a mistake on the roboboar supplemental
upgrades. They have since adjusted the containers so that all will
work appropriately. (The recipes were bugged, now they work. There
will be no change as far as you the players see, other than the fact
that it will now work.)


*** AA ***

- Added a damage component to the wizard AA Cryomancy.
- Removed ranks 4 - 6 of Blood Tithe.  All points spent on this
ability have been refunded.
- Modified the way the Wizard AAs Frenzied Devastation and Prolonged
Destruction work so that they will have a buff icon when active.
- Increased the cost of Glyph of Arcane Secrets to 4 points.
- Corrected the "Heart of" and "Core of" AA lines to only require rank
1 of their respective prerequisite AA lines instead of rank 3, as it
used to be.
- Separated the Paladin and Shadow Knight "Steed" lines.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4 and 5 of the Innate Lung Capacity
line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing lung capacity by the
appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they
did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Extended Notes line
of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the bard song range by the
appropriate percentage and will now increase it by the same percentage
as they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Double Riposte line
of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-riposte rate by
the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as
they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Ferocity line of
AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-attack rate by the
appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they
did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Knight's Advantage
line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-attack rate
by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount
as they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Speed of the Knight
line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the rate to fire an
additional 2H attack by the appropriate amount and will now increase
it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Fury of Magic line
of AA's for Clerics, Druids, Shaman, Enchanters, Magicians, and
Necromancers. These ranks were not increasing the spell crit-rate by
the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as
they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 9, 10, and 11 of the Spell Casting
Fury Mastery line of AA's for Wizards. These ranks were not increasing
the spell crit-rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it
by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation.
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the Lightning
Strike line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the flurry chance
by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount
as they did prior to the AA consolidation.


*** Zones ***

- Fixed an issue that caused crashing out during raid phase
transitions in the Solteris: Stalwart Defenders instance.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Fixed an issue with the Rogue's Backstab ability button that caused
it not to work when clicking it too many times before it was ready to
be activated again.


*** Previously Updated ***

- The Rear Guard Balreth event has been slightly tuned up in
difficulty.
