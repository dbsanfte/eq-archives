One other thing to keep in mind is that killing certain named
NPCs will raise your faction higher than just killing a peon.

I was raising faction with the Coldain on Velious and I killed
about 250 regular non-named frost giants and kael wolves in east
wastes and great divide. This got me from dubious to amiable,
which coincides with that chart.

However, I went on a raid into Kael, and I killed less than 50
giants but most of them were named and above level 45.
When I came out of that raid I was WARMLY to the coldain.
so those 50 giants were worth anywhere from 250-750 points
on the faction scale (depending on where I was in the amiable range
when I started).
