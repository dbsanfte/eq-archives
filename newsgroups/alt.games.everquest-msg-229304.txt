Heh, yep that is about my experience thus far. I've taken a human necro out
of Freeport to lvl6 and to lvl5 before finding ways to get killed. Tried
rangers in Kelethin and Riverdale. Had first tried a wizzie out of Gukta.
Now trying a human mage from Freeport. One thing that's clear is that of all
the above newbie areas, West Freeport is the best for this -- its jammed
with players but the mob pop rate is so high that doesn't matter. I took one
of those necros from zero to 4 in under an hour in West Freeport. GFay was
ridiculous, could hardly find a mob to kill.

Its actually my son and I doing this, we're having fun debating strategy,
taking turns at the controls....our only actual PK experience was his. He
was running that lvl6 necro in WFreeport when a lvl6 troll beastlord started
pestering him to group. He said "no thanks" once, then twice, then had to
again....he declined 5 consecutive unsolicited group invites. At that point
the troll got obnoxious in /tell, and charged as if to attack. So my boy
pointed the skelly pet at him and dotted him....couple minutes later the
troll was dead and we haven't heard from the jerk since. One for the good
guys.

Discord is strangely alluring, I guess because of the hardcore aspect. I
have this little vision of forming a small vigilante gang with some folks
from a.g.e and/or other grownups I know online. A mutual self-protection
group that levels up together and hunts down whoever is the highest levels
on the server that we can get to. For some reason that thought makes me
chortle.

Theoretically a ranger's track should be a deadly advantage once into the
teens hunting other players, but as of this afternoon there wasn't a single
ranger among the couple dozen players 10+ on the server. They were almost
all casters, mostly necros and mages, highest was 19.
