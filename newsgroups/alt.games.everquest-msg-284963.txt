I have my doubts too, but it is reported in

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1102

and in

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1784

Purely anecdotal, of course, which is why I was wondering if anyone had 
any actual experience with the things.  Since the reports are fairly 
old, I'm guessing other people have stumbled accross the threads and 
tried the shackles out for this purpose, if they work, you'd think 
they'd be crowing about it... or if they didn't, you'd think they'd be 
bitter!

The relative silence is confounding.
