Furthermore, it's intended to have some recipes that are never 
searchable.  Recipes can be marked auto-learn (you know them when you are 
within 50 points of the trivial), can-learn (you can learn them after you 
successfully make one the old way), and can't-learn (you will never learn 
them, have to keep making them the old way).
