This won't help one bit.  You see, she's not interested in her offensive skills,
and rightly so, druid melee output is of very little consequence.  What she's
looking for is Defensive skills.  Defense, and (easier to max out) dodge.

The hope is that these skills will either help her get hit less often or to take
less damage when hit.  While getting hit isn't a druid's job, it does happen, it
will happen, to every class with some frequency over the run of the game.  IF the
difference between a low skill and a maxed skill in these areas is good for even a
10% reduction in damage, resulting in even 10% fewer deaths down the line where
mobs start hitting really really hard, then working on them is well worth some
effort.

Common advice to every class is to make a point of getting hit some every level, to
get those skills to move up the mere 5 points per level that they -can- move.
She's neglected to do that, but having realized her mistake, is looking to remedy
the situation.

This being the case, she needs to arrange to get hit, and get hit a lot.  I wish
there was some magical mob I could point her to that hits very fast for practically
no damage, but there isn't.  Still, she's looking for mobs that tend that way, more
hits less damage per hit, as opposed to mobs that take only occaisional but very
large bites.
