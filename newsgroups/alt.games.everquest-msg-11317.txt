This is a great idea.

Invisible GM's and Guides that 'chaperone' a zone periodically. Offensive
players get ported to a 'Twilight Zone' for a while. Granted you may argue
that it becomes somewhat of a 'Police State' but maybe, just maybe, it would
harness the /OOCs and /Shouts that are becoming a very serious distraction
to those who (gasp) want to play the game. Yes I know I can turn those
channels off but sometimes I like to help people who use them for TP
requests and such.

I'll even compromise and suggest the introduction of a new chat mode -
'Social', this would be for non-game related chatter (like YO! KEwldood!, Yo
WUZZAP Kewlchik!, Howzit goin? ad nauseum).

Anyway, I was pretty saddened by those SSs to and wish there was some way to
filter out the idiots.
