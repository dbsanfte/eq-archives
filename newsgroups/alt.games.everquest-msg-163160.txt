Actually, I could have sworn that I did explain what top posting was, maybe
it was to someone else.  Regardless, another good one is to leave in the
attributions as to who posted what, otherwise it will be impossible to tell.
One of the reasons for doing this is that often, newsservers will not get
all posts, so, it would be easy to miss a post somewhere, and without
attribution, and enough quoted content, it would be impossible to know what
is being discussed.
