Obstacles?  I know THREE paladins that have about half the play time
that I have on my druid and are level 60 where my druid is barely 54.
One of them did all the way up to 55 soloing the vast majority of the
time.

Granted, I am NOT a powerleveler, but I don't see how paladins have it
all that bad.  Hell, the seem to have it better than my ranger.
Atticus can do an assload of damage, but becomes ground beef very
quickly if anything starts smacking him.

Tell you what, you can have my rangers snare AND DoT's as long as he
can have your hp and ac.
