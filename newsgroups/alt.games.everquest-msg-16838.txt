I was talking to a new guildie.  He has a L8 chanter, and I have a L31
chanter, so I was giving him some pointers, and basic guild info.  We have a
no beggar policy in our guild, and I passed that along, as well as my
personal dislike of beggars.

He does not like beggars either, but confided in me that his lower brother
has a L1 toon with over 1K PP.  In his spare time he begs with the L1.
