Just wondering if anybody has equipped the PoTC earring on any lower
level characters.  It's listed with a reccomended level of 51, and
apparently they REALLY mean it this time. Tarre got hers for her 48
necro yesterday, equipped it, and the +10 INT had dropped to +8, and the
+80 Mana had dropped to +52.  Still a nice item, but that's a pretty
drastic drop off for three levels below.

What would it do on a level 40? What will I see on my level 50 wizard
when I do the turnin?
