At level one.  Less so at 4, less again at 8, down to probably none at 
all at level 12, then again for a while starting at 24.

This is because pets use -either- their own damage output -or- that 
based on the weapon, whichever is higher.  To compare, take the max 
damage of your unarmed pet (watch him for a while, preferably on really 
easy mobs where his hits will do max damage more often), and for the 
weapon, use the damage rating of the weapon times two.

The reason I say none at all at level 12 is that unless you have a lot 
of cash to throw away, you won't be handing your pet weapons with higher 
than a 10 damage rating, which means 20 max hit, and your level 12 pet 
will do that much on his own.

At level 24 your pet will "dual weild" if armed with two weapons, adding 
a few extra swings per minute.  Rusty daggers would be as good as fine 
steel broadswords for this purpose, your pet will be using his own 
damage output, just needs the help to get the extra swings.  After a few 
levels (dunno how many for mage, much less for necro!)  he won't need 
the help any more.

The other advantages are any stats on the weapons, which your pet will 
use, and procs on the weapon, which your pet will use if he's high 
enough level.  Note I say Pet, not You; as you level up your pet will 
end up lower level than you are.

Fear the mob and Then back off pet.  Or get the pet a SOW.  Or get way 
up in levels and get the AA that makes your pet really obey instructions 
  like this one.

Time your "back off" point better so the mob doesn't die too soon and 
stop worrying about backing off the pet.

Channel your cast of Lifespike while getting beat on and stop worrying 
about backing off the pet.

Mez the mob, this will make the pet stop attacking it (99% of the time, 
sometimes this messes up and pet breaks mez... but its pretty rare)

Fight with a partner and let him worry about aggro instead of you doing 
the tanking.

Mash the "pet back off" button about 10 times in a row while screaming 
curses at your screen.

Probably more solutions than that but those are the ones that come to mind.
