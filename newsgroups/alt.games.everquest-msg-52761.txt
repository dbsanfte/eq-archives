At level 29, druids have two DoTs.  The gnolls I fight in SK usually
require 2 creeping crud and 1 immolate, and by then it's about to run
so I can just melee it down.  With DD kiting, I find that sometimes I
am out of mana, especially when two nukes have hit for a combined 20
points or so =(   

I killed a cyclops that conned even to me with this method, only
problem was that grasping roots broke often, and I got oom but
thankfully it had taken enough damage that it was in its "snared run
mode".
