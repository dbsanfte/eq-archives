I've got a Level 20 (4 blue from 21) "Dorf Waryer" and I'm looking into
upgrading his equipment, or, at least, preparing to upgrade it.  When I
started, I got some minor twinkage from a friend who basically gave me
his cast offs, and my gear really hasn't changed much since then.  I
think it's starting to rust in a few spots *blush*.

I can't visit the bazaar (don't have that expansion yet, just the
trilogy), and I'm not really wealthy, but I do have about 200pp saved
up.  That said, however, *any* advice is appreciated.  If I've somehow
left out any info that might be important, please ask.  Thanks! :-)
