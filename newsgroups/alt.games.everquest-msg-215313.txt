I've done a half-dozen adventures with the ML system and not seen a problem
so far. You do have to clarify the specifics of it at the start,
particularly whether someone whose won a roll for an item is then out of the
rolling until everyone else has something.

And last night someone made a good suggestion: rather than have the ML sell
a diamond and split that cash, we made it the last roll as a consolation
prize for those who had not won an augment or nice item from the adventure.
