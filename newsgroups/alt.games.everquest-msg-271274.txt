Actually, I believe it's just better regen. Duration is decided by the
"quality" (Bland, plain, savory, delectable, I think?). Vendor bought
food is always "bland", and summoned is always below bland. Generally
speaking, the higher level the recipe for crafted food/drink, the
better the regen it offers. However, your regen is limited by your
level. So, you can't get the full benefit of food from a level 20
recipe at level 1.
