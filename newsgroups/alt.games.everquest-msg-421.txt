A friend and I are looking for a new guild, following the collapse of our
old one when the leader's house burnt down - seems a rum excuse for not
playing EQ but some aren't as addicted as the rest of us I guess :).

We're both based in the UK and want to avoid USA times for guild raids,
quests etc. He has a 36th shaman, I have a 37th druid (available for genuine
porting requests but not to be welcomed into a guild with open arms as a
24/7 transport service!) plus a 14th cleric. Neither of us has the time for
lengthy plane raids, but want to benefit from guild grouping, dungeon
bashes, socialising, as well as helping out youngsters etc. We're both
experienced role-players without being obsessed with role-play. We both have
Kunark and Velious.

Any suggestions or invites please post here or email me at
loremaster@ntlworld.com , or send me a tell in-game.

Thanks

Loremaster

Aravail, 37th druid - Honorary Resident of South Karana (been there since
level 24 or so hehe. Plus Iceclad.

Mahala, 14th cleric, usually found in Everfrost.

PS Did I mention I hated orcs? Filthy vermin!
