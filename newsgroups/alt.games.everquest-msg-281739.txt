>Many of the single group attainable rewards from the Depths of
Darkhollow expansion have received significant upgrades.

That is a fact.  I have been avoiding DoD, but did 4 missions last
weekend and received 4 items (level 68 spell missions).

Two of the 4 items were minor upgrades.  The other two I just threw in
the bank.  Anyways, they had roughly 110 hps on each and similar stats
to DoN gear.  After the upgrade all 4 have around 150 hps and nice
bonuses such as mana regen, hp regen, and stun resist.   Now 3 of the 4
are signficant upgrades.

Woot : )
