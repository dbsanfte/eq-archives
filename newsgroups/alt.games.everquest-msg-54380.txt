I got my ring in S. Ro.  Used the undead plan and it worked for me.
Killed undead all day and at 6 killed the undead in tower. This has
worked for at least 3 other people I know.  Waited and pop... AC
spawned on west side of zone and was dead in 30 seconds.
The rest of the quest was incredibly lucky.  Zoned into Rathe
Mountains and in less than a minute someone said they spotted Hasten
and gave the /loc.  I got there and he was running back and forth over
a small 50 foot stretch of ground.  I just stood there and waited for
him to return and hailed him.  I could not believe my luck. And he did
take plat instead of gold.

The OOT spawn is good if you have infinite patience or great luck.  A
friend camped it for almost 2 days nonstop.  No AC.  He wound up
getting TBoots in frustration.
