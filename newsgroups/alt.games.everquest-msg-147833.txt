With over 2000 quests I bet there are 200 are decent to do
at least, that's 10%. They can't all be great.

Yes but they are still quests. Not everyone would benefit
from every quest. Like the Testament quest is not good
for an INT caster or a melee class.

I particularly like the curscale armor quest for the Iksar
newbies. Gets you good starting armor and the exp is
very nice.

Whether they are worth it is really dependant on the person
and what gear and resources they have. If they are in an uber
guild and have tons of cash and lots of twink characters then
most of these items are crap. But for the person with only one
character and a small guild these are nice.
