Hehe, very interesting idea. Only problem is, there isnt any other
copies.  Took me 12 stores to even find this copy and all they have
are dvd's.  Seems to be a very hard game for stores to get(even the
large chains).  

Thats what I get for wanting to play a new game like this ;-)
Either its very popular or SOE didnt make enough copies at first.
