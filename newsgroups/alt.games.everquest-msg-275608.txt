Well, I know this theory has been done to death.  However, when an SOE 
bigwig gives a long speech about Blizzard, and admits WoW is a threat in so 
many words, then releases an expansion that except for instanced guildhalls 
sounds just like WoW, I find it fishy.  In WoW, to access a an instance, you 
have to go through part of a regular dungeon or dangerous outside area to 
get to.  All quests in WoW are progressive with the exception of very few, 
AFAIK.  Also, many of the Dragons in the game are outdoors and not difficult 
to get to.

I am merely saying that it sounds like SOE is desperately trying to win back 
subscribers, like me, who dumped EQ for a game that IMHO is a thousand times 
better, by releasing an expansion that is so parallel with WoW it is 
suspicious.
