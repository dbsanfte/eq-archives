I was in the Field of Bone and there was a Iksar Footpad that conned
green to me.  I figured he might have something on him, so I attacked.

Well, a couple of hits later he runs off *into* the side of the pit and
disappears.

I walk well away from the wall to see if I can see him, figuring he might
come back when he heals up sufficiently.  But he doesn't.

However, he starts hitting me again.  From nowhere.   I look around me
and there's no one there.  He's not hitting hard, and is missing a lot,
but once in a while scores a hit for 5 or so.  Not knowing what to do,
I run back to the guards at the ent to FoB and they don't do anything.
They stand there like rocks.

I'm still getting hit, and there's no one in sight.  Finally I just
zone and come back.  Problem solved.

The only legitimate explanation I can think of is that Iksar footpads
can go invis and can hit while invis.  Otherwise, this smacks of bug.
