I play on luclin but i have no paladin there, i have a cleric, druid
and a shaman + various casters, but they are all low level so i could
not afford to buy stuff from you..

Why not leave him as he is, you can still create new ones on other
servers, i do have 31 guys in total but of course if you like to get
something to start with on another server, try EC and see if anyone is
trading between servers..
