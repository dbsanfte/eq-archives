Well, it might be a start, for one class of bug...

I feel I should point out that I never intended this thread to progress in 
this manner, and I'm truly sorry if that similarly has unintended 
consequences.  But I feel I must point out that Twohead, hughes and DT 
have all violated Rule 12 of the Rules of Conduct posted on the 
everquest.com website, to wit:

"you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug
(bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), 
either directly or through public posting, to any other user of 
EverQuest."

I'm sorry.  Good luck, guys.  I know it's only a bug that pretty much
everyone has a nodding familiarity with, now that Verant has slipped
and mentioned it in the Conquest brouhaha, but a rule is a rule, isn't it?

And this is also specifically why I'd like to see this policy _seriously_
revised.

I must also say that I can think of instances where the TwoHead rule of
thumb above may be innacurate, and may lead one to dangerous conclusions.
But I won't discuss that further.  I like my account.  I've endangered it
enough for the sake of argument.

But I will note that this part Verant never really said was necessarily an
exploit... They almost even said it was all right, if they were not 
simultaneously using a method to build up aggro on the warrior.  But of 
course, that comes down to _my_ interpretation of Brad's words, and Brad 
may not be the final authority on this.
