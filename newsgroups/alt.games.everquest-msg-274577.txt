Aaaahhh...but I wasn't replying to the OP. I was replying to the
poster who brought up the point that a person can't protect their
children from what is said in ooc/shout/say.

I had considered replying to the OP's post but didn't. Now I will
though. :)

I'm also in a family guild. While the guild is not a *strict* role-
play guild a la FV server and it's focus has changed a bit recently
with the departure of our former guildleader, his in-game wife, and
quite a few of the more senior officers, there are still aspects of
role-play that we adhere to. One of the guild's requirements is
that you *cannot* be of evil alignment and be in the guild. You
also *cannot* do evil acts and remain in the guild. Acting honorably
and with integrity is required. (I say 'acting' because sometimes
people aren't really honorable but as long as they *act* it.... :) )

I've been in the guild for 2 years now and I've only ever seen
one person leave the guild (he deguilded himself) over one curse
word. But, it wasn't even the one word itself that caused the
uproar that led to his leaving the guild. (BTW, he rejoined the
guild a month or so later and there hasn't been any problems
since.) What caused the bad feelings and the behind-the-scenes
talking to that led to him leaving was his *insistence* that he
had the right to say what he wanted when he wanted because he
was an adult and anyone that didn't like what he said should,
as an adult, just suck it up and deal with it.

In actuality and in practice, it wasn't the curse word itself
(or any of the curse words that occasionally slip out in the
guild channels), it was the, uhm, what's the word I want?
Insensitivity, I guess, to the person/people who objected to
his language.

Now, as far as the other stuff that goes on in the channel,
we, too, have our moments where things get risque. :P But,
it's highly dependent on *who* is in the chat channel at the
time. Our former guildleader and/or his wife? Didn't happen.
And there are one or two other members where, if they're on,
the risque stuff just doesn't happen.

It's sorta like real life, you know? When I was in the Navy
and the CO was in the room, everyone self-censored themselves.
Once the CO was gone, well, all hell would break loose. :P
