I am willing to suspend disbelief one last time (Hell I have played EQ

A troll (in news group terms) is a person who posts nonsense in order to 
get lots of (preferably angry) replys.

I'm afraid that if you are not a troll (see above) and you really can't 
get any xp at level 5 then you are possibly the most inept player I have 
ever heard of. Fortunatly this can be fixed by asking questions 
(polietly) and listening to the answers.

There is a player race in EQ called trolls too. They are a bit like D&D 
trolls, and are far more respected.

God, I can't remember, Left click and hold and drag I think. Things that 
you can drag in include : The action stuff that you can get from the 
window at the bottom right of the screen (not that this is where you can 
configure your own macro hot keys), Inventory slots, Spell gems.

Generally up to about level 15 grouping is pointless. The first 10 
levels at least are really for solo play to get used to the interface. 
this is where you learn to use all the buttons etc.
Once you get to say level 12 you should be able to find people to group 
with.

I have never heard it called that.
Camping is when you just go after one sort of monster for a particular 
reason. This usually happens at a fixed spawn point (e.g. a hut where 
goblins spawn). A player or group with then "camp" the hut and try to 
kill all the goblins there. This is normally to get a particular item or 
rare monster to spawn.

In the code they are called MOBile Objects. This refers to anything like 
a monster, including NPCs and the like. Its just a bit more general.


> How do you go about finding information about quests 


In game go up to any NPC (like your guild master) target them and then 
hail them. They may reply with some text. Read it and follow 
instructions as applicable. Also like it says in the manual there may be 
[bracketed] text. Try asking dumb questions like :
What bracketed text
Where is bracketed text
Or saying things like :
I am the bracketed text that you are looking for.


This system is a bit of a PITA. So most people look up quests on the net.
Have a look at the quest lists for your home town's zones on :
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

Also get some maps from :
http://www.eqatlas.com/

Scribing :
1) Have a caracter that can learn spells and be the right level
2) Buy the spell that you want to learn (and be the right class and level)
3) Open your spell book
4) open your inventory and pick up the spell (have it on your cursor)
5) Click on a blank space in your spell book
6) WAIT. There is a bar, like a loading bar, scribing spells takes time.
7) When you get the message that scribing is finished your done.

To memorise.
1) Open your spell book.
2) Left click on a scribed spell untill it is on your cursor
3) click on one of the spell gems
4) Wait again this takes time
5) Once the spell is memorised the spell gem will be greyed out for a 
while. Once it un greys you can cast the spell

Ok Warriors can't cast spells.
Which city did you start in ?

If you want to restart (probably not) then I can recomend Dwarves and 
halflings as starter character races as their low level zones are nicely 
set out.
