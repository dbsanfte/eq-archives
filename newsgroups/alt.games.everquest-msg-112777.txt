I'd say it's probably worth it if you expect to draw agro or be hit by AoE.

It can depend on your class and level, but the way I see it is that, as a
wizzie, I could kill myself with 2 full hits from my best spell.  Or with
one hit from my best and a much smaller spell, for that matter.  You mention
wisdom, so aren't a wizzie, but the idea is the same.  If you are fighting
blues, they are probably only one spell rank behind you.  A single resist to
one of their spells could very easily be the difference between living and
dying.

Ultimately, though, there are too many variables for anyone but you to make
that decision.  Experiment with it a bit and see what you think.
