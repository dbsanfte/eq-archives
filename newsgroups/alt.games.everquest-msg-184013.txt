Well got the new expansion, made a wiz frog (never played a wiz before),
changed my face on all my characters and checked out the armor dye.   That
armor dye looks like fun but it shows that I need reagents to make it stick.
I can't find any information to tell me what I need.  The only information I
have found is armor dyes before new expansion.  I think I am missing
something here.  So all of you who have posted a ton of information that I
gratefully use all the time, can you help me understand how this new dye
works?
Stay Safe
