Yes he was born a Jew. He might not have been one when he died. After 
all, we can assume he was teaching 'christian' morals, and if he 
beleived he was the son of god and was dying to pay for the worlds sins 
then he beleived the single most importants tenets of the christian 
faith. Does that make him 'Christian'?

Well it could be construed to imply that Jesus himself did not beleive 
he was the son of god, nor that he died to 'save our sins'. Essentially 
suggesting that Christianity is a crock, that its own messiah didn't 
beleive in it.

That would come accross as an insult.

And when people do remind them, as often as not its a shot meant to rile 
them up. :)
