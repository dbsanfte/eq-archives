I don't see any more than normal. Even if there is a larger chunk
complaining, why would it be only a certain small (yes, even if it is
a larger chunk, it's still small) portion? If it were a problem at
Verant's end or with the software, it should be the small portion
that's NOT having problems, not the other way around.

Gee, could it be a problem with a router those "more and more" people
all go through?
