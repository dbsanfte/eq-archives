Just in case anyone else is as dense as me, I'll expand on that. (I'm far from
the brightest bulb on the tree, it seems. I had to read that twice before I
realized that Gladmir was exactly correct.)
  To put it another way, you can think of the blue par as your progress towards
having the next full yellow bubble.  Each time you fill up a yellow, the blue
will reset to zero and then start creeping up again as you work towards the next
yellow. It will cross the area five times total between levels.
