There's also no valid reason to have a gnome cleric or warrior, a dark
elf shadowknight or warrior, a half elf druid, a human anything but
monk. And if stats don't really matter for non casters (which many

want to play a less than ideal race/class combination?

And it's SO hard to go to Butcherblock, Steamfont, or the Commonlands,
isn't it? (As it is, I like Kelethin and can ignore annoying people)
