Umm, I don't know in that case. I'd heard about people buying recent
versions of the original + RoK pack and not having the tutorial, so I
assumed it was all new editions. I've got the English RoK edition from
before Christmas and that had the tutorial, but for some reason the tutorial
doesn't work any more (I tried to hack it, but I did back it up first. Even
the backup no longer works)
