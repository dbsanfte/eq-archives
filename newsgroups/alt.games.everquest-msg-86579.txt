THANKS!!!  I hadn't heard that yet.  I've been tinkering around with my
system for weeks trying to figure out the problem to no avail.  I haven't
got the beefiest system in the world, but it more than meets the specs
required so this has been a pain in my ass.
At least now I can leave it alone, knowing it's not my system, and hope for
the best.

Thx,
Sean...
