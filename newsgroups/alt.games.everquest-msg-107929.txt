Is it easy to get *into* Sirens Grotto? I've heard horror stories about 
mobs that see invisible right near the entrance... I do have Improved 
Superior Camo, though. I paid 1.2k for it, and I don't regret one copper.

I assume Scorpa of the Ring is like Gorenaire... Non-KOS unless you do 
something stupid like showing up with an illusion up...?

Thanks to all for the good info!
