That's the difference to what was Verant's vision(tm) of an MMORPG and SOE's
MMOG.
An example of this is the naming policy. What used to be the name of your
Character is now just your "nick" so if you want to be called
"lookatmymullet" then you can. What held people in the game was the High End
content so that's where they went with it.

I fully understand your reasons for quitting and after reading your last
post I almost want to join you.

If you want to give your stuff away, create some quests, then go to the,
lesser populated, zones of appropriate level for such quests and offer
item(s) for as rewards for them...Be prepared for the "I can't find any,
can't you just it to me anyway?" though...
One last piece of RP and maybe that newbie(if your lucky) will remember your
character's name and actions.
