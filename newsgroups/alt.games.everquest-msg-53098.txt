No, I'm talking about requiring -all- trade skills at between master
and grandmaster levels (well, not class only ones like tinkering and
poison... hmm, better not give em any ideas, or only gnome rogues
will be able to do the 8th shawl!), even though most trade skills are
useless in general, and some even more useless than others for most
classes... tell me how many casters or healers use archery?  Yet
those are the people most likely to put themselves
thru the labor of getting the shawls.

I hear tailoring for shawl 7 doesn't trivial till 190, thats got to be far
more annoying than jewelcraft, which only requires you throw
money and time at the skill... heck, you can even work while you
meditate.
