    Or you were sitting when adds came. Or you were the closest person to a
proximity-hate add. Or a mob at 50% decided the worst thing that had ever
happened to it was being snared. Or.... stuff happens.

    ... the cleric has to res you. Res, post-res heal, and rebuffing you
with what few buffs you want is more expensive than just keeping you alive.
And you're useless post-res for some time. Biggest thing that can drag a
raid down is deaths, as the clerics go lower and lower bringing you back (or
re-buffing after you're right-clicked back) and can't heal and more people
start to die....

>Me asking for buffs is costing my party mana, and downtime.

    Think big picture, and think safety. Losing 5% efficiency to safeguard
against something that'll shut a party down is worth it.
