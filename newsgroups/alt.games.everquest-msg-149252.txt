Just because stupid people have children doesn't mean the child will
be stupid. Most kids love to rebel against what their parents stand
for so when they are rebels against stupidity they find out it's a lot
better than being a vegetable all your life and accomplishing nothing.
It just keeps going back and forth, just right now since people care
more about the media than what the media has to say we are really in a
rut. Hopefully it won't take a nuclear fucking war to wake us up but
who knows maybe some people deserve it and would learn from it.
