I don't want to see a.g.e. turn into alt.politics but this bit is
something I can't walk away from w/o a response.  See I was there too
and this recovery you speak of is not the world I lived in during those
years.  My recollection of the Reagan years and its effect on my life is
one of being trickled upon and believe me I still  hold him responsible
for that.  I think it can best be summed up by this little tale.

Circa 1982:
Leaving my graveyard shift job as a security guard I walked downtown in
the cold gray of a midwest winter dawn.  I was cold but my spirits were
high because I'd seen an add for a job in the paper that night that I
was sure I'd have a shot at.  This second job would mean being able to
buy actual food for the first time in years.  Confidence was  high as
the ad clearly was for a job only someone as desperate as myself would
apply for: morning clean up in an all night porn shop!  Ugly job sure,
but this would mean food and I'd been hungry for a long time.  Pride
could no longer be an issue when the body had suffered for so long. 
Then the reality hit.  Forty men there at dawn applying for a job that
no sane person would consider taking.  The walk home was colder and
darker though dawn had passed to morning.  Somehow Reagan's trickling is
not something I remember fondly, rather I refer to those years as the
Reagan Depression and so do many others who were trickled upon.  Now you
tell me who is the revisionist cause those aren't false memories I have,
I was there and they were all too real.
