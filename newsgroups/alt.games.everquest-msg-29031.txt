nah, drosophila melanogaster is the fruit fly, much beloved of
geneticists.

A house fly is musca domestica, I believe.

Fruit flies aren't really symbols of disease and pestilence - you'd
probably be better off with the mosquito or something (Aedes aegypti)

Of course, all of the above are pretty sucky names, but if you're gonna
do it, might as well pick the right species...
