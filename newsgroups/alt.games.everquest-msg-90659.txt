11am Peak time? for who, night workers? Students? Children on holiday?
Hmm thought Half term was last week, guess it does change over the country.

So we have a game that isn't widely available outside the US (by your
estimations) and they should set up EQ conventions outside of the US...but
they, according to you, don't actually make any effort to publicise it or
make it available to other countries, why should they arrange for these
conventions to be held elsewhere?

Erm...right, we'll get back to that.

No need to defend them, they have done nothing wrong, they moved their patch
times from morning PST to early Morning PST, at their own expense (Was 8 or
9am starts in US is now 3am starts in US, by the time I've got home and
settled the servers will be up if I want to play)

Why? They are your opinions you are welcome to them, email Verant with the
same complaint only don't be so afraid as not to include your Account name.

I don't need to get off my arse to exercise my brain, unlike yours, mine
isn't in my arse. Oh and it's far from flabby, thanks.

No, a five year old would probably be correcting you grammar.

Ahh the nerd comment, how spiteful, whereas, by earlier comments, you appear
to be a Trekkie, wow so much further up the social scale than Nerd or Geek

Your buddies at Paramount (and all other film companies in the US) often
release films to DVD/Video in the states before the UK even gets a cinema
release, meaning by the time a film is released here it is usually spoiled
by the media, scream and shout about that one too.

I would point out how trivial this matter is, that EQ is not a basic human
right and if Verant wanted to release a game only available in the states
the European court of Human rights could do nothing about it...but as this
is just flamebait I won't bother going any further...nice posting name, btw.
