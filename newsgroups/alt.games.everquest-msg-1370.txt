If the Erudin guards only glower at you dubiously, then you are safe.  They
will not talk to you but they will not attack you either.  Just continue
past them and go to the docks.  All guards should be the same so if one is
dubious, they all should be but you may want to \con anyone else that you
see, and I would not advise going into any of the buildings as some of the
poeple in them will attack you.
