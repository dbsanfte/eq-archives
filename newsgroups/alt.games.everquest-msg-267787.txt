In other words, you sold out and became The Man.

Seriously though, endless hours of video game playing are definitely a waste
of time. But for simple recreation, it's no better or worse than TV.

I would tend to agree, at least for those who play several hours a day.
Unless you're one of those clever lads who sells off his virtual goods for
real money. But again, if it's not obsessive, where's the harm?

There's nothing wrong with going through a drug-taking, game-playing,
slut-fucking phase before settling down into a real adult. Plus it gives you
something to reminesce about when you're 80 and can't do any of the above.

LOL.

I'll leave the "sitting in your bedroom and playing guitar is for people
with no ambition in life" to someone else.
