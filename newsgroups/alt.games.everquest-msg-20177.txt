Ever since i looted an awesome Velious Spiked Skull Helm (no graphic) most
people cant see my head!  You can see my face and ears but top of my head is
gone. I have downloaded the velious patches each day and thought the problem
was solved till many people continue to tell me me head is missing.  I then ask
if they have downloaded recent velious patches and sure enough most of them
have.  I dont understand.  And I want a graphic darnit!  :)
