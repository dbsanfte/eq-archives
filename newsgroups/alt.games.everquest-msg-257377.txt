not that i have nothing better to do, but....i'd like to disagree

i can't think of a single item that carries a price because of its name

what is sentimental to one (or a whole group of people from 1 era) is trash
to another

jagged blade of mourning was the first uber weapon i ever owned...no one
else ever sighs when they see it, or is unable to give it away

sceptre of destruction, blade of carnage, fungus covered scaled tunic, cloak
of flames, white dragon helm, cowl of mortality, mithril boots, velium
gauntlets, mask of the tinkerers (whatever) -- these items have names that
get dropped for their names alone, but they are all carrying stupid price
tags based on the market and the item, not the shmaltz associated with them

if they changed the name of any of those items, or if a duplicate came from
legends with a different name, the item itself would have the same price
(and the same worth)

i think
