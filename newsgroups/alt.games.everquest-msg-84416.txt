Also along these lines... is there any way to download a fully organized
spell book?
I know I dont have many of the spells, but is the spell book stored
someplace that can be more easily editted than via the damn right-clicking
and right-clicking to move the spells?  I am only level 20 but still, that's
s LOT of spells to move around in the book.  Is there an easier way?!
