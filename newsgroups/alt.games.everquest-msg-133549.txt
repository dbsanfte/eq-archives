Ok.. NOW yer into a subject that my knowledge is endless!!!  :^)

I doubt there are many 2 yr olds who watch Star Trek..  :^)

I doubt there are even fewer who can comprehend it..  :^)

Except Lena's kids of course...  :^)  Her lil prodigys could probably
recite Cochrane's entire theory of Warp Drive and T'Kulkan's Theory of
Astronomic Influences while they were still in diapers..  :^)

I agree....  But why introduce that to them at 2 yrs old, as Lena et
al suggests???

Why not wait til they are a little older??  

Hell, HERE is a novel concept...  Why not wait until the PARENT feels
the child should learn that??   :^)

I see plenty of evidence that this subject would definetly be treated
in a different manner.

First and foremost, the concept that, in SA, AIDs and HIV is for all
intents and purposes, a national emergency..

Put another way..

Here in the US, we see all sorts of reports and news shows about Small
Pox...  Don't you think that, if we were in the middle of a Small Pox
epidemic, with millions upon millions of people dead, that reports and
news shows about small pox would be shown in a different manner??
Don't you think that the reports and the news shows would concentrate
more heavily on prevention, rather then on it's societal effect?

Call me a cynic if you must.  But, a TV show for kids that have a doze
or more characters that can teach tolerance.  An HIV muppet, in a
nation where there is a national epidemic of AIDs and HIV...
Hmmmmmmmm  You don't see the possibility of an ulterior motive??
