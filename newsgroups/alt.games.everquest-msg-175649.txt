 Truly. When DAoC came out I was there with everyone else and excited about
the tradeskills. They are pretty nice but after working my way up
weaponsmithing to near 500 I ran into a snag where my secondary tradeskills
were no longer up to the task of being able to make my necessary components.
I know that's they way they intended it to work but I no longer enjoyed
it at that point.

 Hopefully SWG will not have this same wall for people to slam into. It
would be interesting to be a tradeskiller able to craft high-value items
for others to enjoy but at the same time having to rely on onther players
to help you get there (by supplying components you can't make) to me is not
the best way to do it.
