Hmm, just tried to log in a different character, same thing occured... o 
not the same thing, since he hadn't crashed out in the first place.

But again, it takes forever and then stops and up comes the "do you want 
to tell SOE" screen, and then I'm back at desktop.

So, I still don't know if its at SOE's end, or at my end, but something 
is corrupting .ini files.

Perhaps I've got a virus on both machines thats doing the same thing?
