Maybe. Maybe not. An emulator is powerful thing. Apple has used them 
extensively over the years. Microsoft, in typical form, is just catching 
on... hell they bought the biggest PC emulator on the 
market...Connectix's Virtual PC, just so they could offer backwards 
compatibility back to DOS without actually having to keep XP 100% DOS 
compatible.

I thought he was referring to the car owners manual.

FWIW there is a linux distro that boots off a single CDROM and doesn't 
need to be installed.

You shouldn't be able to do that period. Unless you really truly intend 
for your software to work with exactly one piece of hardware.

Actually with the .net framework, or java class library its far easier 
to make a simple app then it ever was, and just as 'understandable'.

The *worst* period in history was when you were writing in C against the 
Windows 3.x APIs, or even early MFC crap, where the 'hello world' 
program was 8 pages of boilerplate.

Sure DOS was great for banging out little utilities, but that is about it.

Try to do anything sophisticated with the UI and it became a monster. 
And then there's always threading issues, the inability to actually 
multitask apps, etc etc... no...DOS was not all that great.

Right. And nobody will ever need more than 640k ram either.
