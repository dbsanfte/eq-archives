You know what I would have said that Roots resisted more, but I just
checked my logs. These cover my Druid from level 23 to level 29 :

Spell            Cast Resist    Percent
Ensnaring Roots   27       5      13.7
Grasping Roots   512      70      15.2
Ensnare           33       5      18.5
Snare            830     139      16.7

Root spells      542      75      13.8
Snare spells     857     144      16.8

Not a lot of difference, but some and not the way that I immagined it.
Cause I am generally casing on blue mobs, but the mobs are the same sets
for each spell.

HTH,

Jim
