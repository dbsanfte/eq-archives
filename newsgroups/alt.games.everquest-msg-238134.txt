*knocks Ben upside the head with her desk caddy*  Was not!  It was bad,
but not *THE* most obvious troll post.  Hmph.

It's rather curious, though...Lonely Guy and Hotwizard have the same
quick-posting habits, and the coincidence that Lonely Guy disappears right
before Hotwizard takes the stage is pretty big...BUT, you notice that
their attitudes are different?  Lonely Guy was sort of...upbeat and
self-apologetic, often saying things like "I know I also did some things
wrong, BUT..." (and a bit of a spazz).  Hotwizard is openly insulting of
folks from the start.  If it's a sock puppet, it's someone who is very,
erm (how to say it...), flexible in their personality. Border-line
multiple-personalities, so to speak.
