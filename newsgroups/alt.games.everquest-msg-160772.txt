Sure, perfect logic.  What fraction of the populace will override
a snap judgement based on emotion, especially "it's not fair!",
with a reasoned consideration of any situation?  1%?  2% maybe?
What fraction of the population will seek personal advantage at
the expense of others whenever they think they can get away with
it, especially if instead of hiding their behavior they can claim
their behavior is justified based on something generally accepted?
10%?  20%?  75%?  Is it really a fair statement to say that "you're
getting less total exp guildwide"?  Or is a more accurate statement
for most guilds "a handful of specially privileged guildies are no
longer getting bonus xp"?  Did the few folks who got plus xp on a
regular basis go out of their way to help the handful who got minus
xp on a regular basis to make up the difference?  Did/do the folks
who often lose xp due to their roles get special treatment in some
other way?


My comments and questions are those of an interested observer.

The tiny bit of "raiding" I've done has always been with a
specific purpose (generally to get somebody an epic drop) that
didn't take all that much time to accomplish, so xp has been
totally immaterial.
