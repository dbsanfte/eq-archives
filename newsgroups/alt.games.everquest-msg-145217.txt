From what I understand, Half elves do make decent bards, but as for
druids, no.  They have probably the worst starting wis for all of the
druid classes.  Even with dumping all the points into wis that you
can, you still won't break 100.

That's not to say that half elves don't make decent druids, it's just
that they're they are the worst of the available options for that
class.
