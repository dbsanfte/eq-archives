Yes, this post is not about stupid character names, but the really cool
names of places and people in Everquest itself. One of the things that I
like about this game (one of many, of course), is that they seem to have
a producer with a good ear for names. Of course, they are derivative of
Tolkien, who was and remains the undisputed champion of the Perfect
Name, but then again, he was a linguist and knew a thing or two about
the matter.

The thing is, imitating Tolkien is a non-trivial undertaking, just
witness the rather uninspiring names in most fantasy novels, or in, say,
Asheron's Call. The fact that names belonging to different races and
factions keep a degree of internal phonetic and linguistic consistency,
is really appreciated. You can immediately imagine, just by hearing
them, that Kelethin and Felwythe are Elven enclaves, while Khaladim and
Thurgadin are Dwarven cities. Again, this is straight out of Tolkien,
but it's *well* done... The names are euphonic, roll off the tongue
easily, and leave a good aftertaste.

NPC names are a mixed bunch... There are just so many NPCs that having a
lot of crap ones is just inevitable, but most of the characters with
"title" style names are actually pretty good, like the Kelethin guards,
and some of the Dragons are pure genius (Trakanon, Sontarak and others).
Of course, making a good-sounding three syllable name is not rocket
science, but it's not exactly trivial either (again, take a look at most
other fantasy games).

I'm not saying that Verant is home to a linguistic genius of Tolkien's
calibre, but definitely they cannot be accused of having a tin ear, and
the game is all the better for it (hell, even the random name generator
is rather good).

PS. I hope they force people to use the random name generator in the RP
server. Unlimited rolls, of course, until something good comes up, but
they should make people wait to use their creativity until level 20.
