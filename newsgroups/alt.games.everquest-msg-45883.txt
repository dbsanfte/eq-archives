That might work once in a while; but probably not often enough to make it worth
using as a tactic. The problem is that DD spells carry a chance to break root every
time they hit, and this series of spells delivers 4 (I think?) waves of damage to
the spot the target was standing on when you cast it. Therefore, if root breaks
prematurely (very likely to happen) and the target moves, the rest of the spell will
be wasted and the damage it does won't be nearly as impressive.
