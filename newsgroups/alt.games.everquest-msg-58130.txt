You had absolutely no buisness going in and helping . Hell my agnostic
chanter wouldnt even help kill in in pog just because he is a high elf and
he could wear the stuff that dropped there.

In hogcallers inn in freeport there is a dwarf on the top level . Hand him
8000 muffins 4 at a time and that will fix your faction.
