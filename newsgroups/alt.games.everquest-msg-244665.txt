Screw all that programming crap (although the examples are cute).  Let's 
try some real evidence that objects don't exist client side, but on the 
server.

I start up two instances of EQ, from the same directory.  On one, I log on 
Zinphandel on the Fiiona Vie server.  On the other, I log on Zinphandel of 
Ayonae Ro.  firiona.zin goes out a-huntin' and kills a beastly_beast_006, 
loots it, and now has a Trinket of Not Normally Droppable in his 
inventory.  Upon right clicking it, firiona.zin notices that, since he's 
on the Firiona Vie server, it's droppable here!  Being somewhat stunned by 
this revelation, he sends a ;tell ayonae.zinphandel with the link.  After 
pressing alt-tab, ayonae.zin clicks the link.  And much to his lack of 
suprise, sees a ToNND, complete with No Drop flag, just like he always 
does.

So, what's this prove?  Well, if the item was stored client side, surely, 
the links ayonae.zin and firiona.zin clicked would refer to the exact same 
spot where the item is stored client side, since after all, it'd be the 
same file in the same directory.  And would therefore be identical.  But 
no!  firiona.zin's link refers to the ToNND as it is stored on the Firiona 
Vie server item database, and ayonae.zin's link refers to the item in the 
Ayonae Ro item database.  So clearly, all ToNND's you see exist on the 
server, and not on the client.  Sure, the graphic for an equipped ToNND 
exists on the client, since it looks exactly like a Trinket of Adornment, 
a Trinket of Ownage, or a Trinket of Droppable.  That's what's in all 
those 'gequip' files in the directory.  Not the stats.

For further proof, I don't suppose you have any recommended level weapons?  
Remember a while back, when you logged in, and noticed that now there was 
a red nerf number for the damage, on that weapon that did full damage when 
you logged just the day before?  Ask yourself... how were they able to 
change your copy of the object, when you were camped out at the time?

}SO HARD TO TOUCH MY ASS.

With all due respect, why would we want to?
