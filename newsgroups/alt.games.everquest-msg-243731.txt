Somewhat related, there was a time when there were no soul-bound items, and
there were zones that required a key to enter (one key per person), where
they keep took weeks or months to get.

Consider what happens if a raid wipes out in such a zone, leaving everyone
outside the zone, with their keys on their corpses inside the zone.  Not
pleasant.

So, you'd do something like this:

    1. Die at the raid starting location, get res back, loot all but one
    item.

    2. Zone into raid zone.  Die.  Get res back in.  Loot key.

    3. Get resed back to outside corpse.  Finish looting it.  Die again, get
    resed back.  Loot all but key.

    4. Get resed back in to raid, loot corpse.

Net result: you are in raid zone, key is on corpse outside raid zone.

Before a raid left, you'd see dozens of "Soandso has defeated Somebastard in
a duel to the death!" as the raiding guild made their corpses.

Sony eventually got tired of this, and changed most of those keys so they
stayed with you on death.
