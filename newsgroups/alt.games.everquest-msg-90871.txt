I have a question about the Celestial Fists. I notice its not a primary or
secondary weapon item. So my question is this, If I have the fists is it
better to use nothing in my hands or what if I used a hand item like the
fists from PoA? Does that slow me down or reduce my attack, or increase.
Also I notice a lot of monks who have their fists put a weapon in their
offhand. Whats the main reason for that if the fists are so awsome?

Thanks for your help
