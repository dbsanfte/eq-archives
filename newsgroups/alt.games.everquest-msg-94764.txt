Until of course you empty 3 bars of mana porting folks around for free and
realize you have been online for over an hour....
Well your time is worth whatever it is to you.
Mine appears to be a little more valuable.
CR ports are free. If I am heading out someplace and others want to come too
np. But when I am getting tells for ports, Anon or not, my time and mana are
worth what my time and mana can get hunting. If my time is not worth
anything, then the rude requester can use their feet.

Casting 40 mana SoW's are one thing.( folks who ask for Spirit of Wolf are
always free. SoW Plz = depends ). Casting 300 mana Circles are quite
another.
