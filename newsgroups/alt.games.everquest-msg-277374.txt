Yes, frankly, I was disappointed with Permafrost. After I completed the 
statues quest I wondered what else there was besides the few named running 
around and of course the Vision of Vox. I'm sure there's a lot more there 
than has yet met my eye, but so far I'm much more impressed with LS and SE. 
Beautiful zone, but it pales in comparison to Lavastorm.
