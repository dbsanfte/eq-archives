Ok Biz, you have my attention now. I have been playing since day of release.
I have 3 characters over 45, and the other 5 over 30 on E'ci server. All of
my characters have their own stuff, decent but not "uber" by any means. The
most plat I have ever had at one time on any character was about 5k.

Besides becoming a full time wheeler dealer, how on earth can you say that
if you can't make 60k in a month, you are doing something wrong?
