6K I think I can swing....it would be just to nights of heady kiola and
farm'n for leather padding.

The clicky on the item to get the mount to appear was the part I was
missing.
The kiolas move better when priced at 4pp, but I don't do that too often,
Aoebe just
sits waiting for the folks that have them for less sell out and then
eventually she sells her stash.

thanks,

Aoebe
