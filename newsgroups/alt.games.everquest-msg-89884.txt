Taking a shot in the dark here.  This is what I would try if I were really
willing (complete waste of time imo, since at this level the Necro gains his
first duel wielding pet)

Get you MR to about 100 unbuffed, your PR and DR to no less than 70
unbuffed.

Iron Bound Tomb, Pumice Stone, Fist of Bone, Bracer of the Hidden, Bow of
the Huntsmen, Crested Mistmoore Shield, Belt of Guardianship, Blackened
Alloy Coif, Bloodstained Mantle, Filth Covered Boots

What to do with all of that I leave to you... its your fight ;p
