<<Why do certain areas not have overhead maps when you hit the backspace key.
Like Crushbone and several others, it makes it very hard to know where you
are!>>

I have never understood this myself.  Why did they release maps to some zones
but not all and then to top it all off there's a website you can go to that has
some more maps but it still isn't all of them.  That one will never make any
sense to me.  One day, maybe in EQ2, I hope they come out with a mapping system
that makes some sense.  How about some automatic mapping that fill in for areas
that you've already explored or maybe a cartography tradeskill that people
could sell maps with.
