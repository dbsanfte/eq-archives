Hi, 

Can anyone tell me how I can turn on auto logging please?

I had it working until about a month ago when I fiddled with a number
of ini files to try and resolve a LD problem (which turned out to be
an ISP problem anyway) and now I have to turn on logging manually with
the /log command each time I join the game - very frustrating!!

I like to have logging on all the time so I can revisit to see where I
went wrong when I die etc - so I use regularly ;)

I have done a /ooc in the game - but no-one seems to know.

Hopefully you oracles will be able to point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance
Cheers
