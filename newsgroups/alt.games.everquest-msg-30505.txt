Do you really think so?  I suppose it boils down to a matter of
playstyle.  I've had EQ since it was released, and in that span of
time I've created literally dozens of characters.  I know my way
around every starting city and just about every zone on Antonica and
Faydwer.

I'm not saying that's especially praiseworthy, just that it's so.
I'll bet you do too.  And most of the people posting to this
newsgroup.

[Who here, reading this post, wouldn't know how to get to Qeynos from
a starting point in West Karana?  Raise your hands please.]

Now, I suppose there are people who start their very first character
and think, "Hot damn!  This baby's for me!" and play it all the way up
to 50+ without every starting another.  But my gut feeling is that
they're probably very much in the minority.

My point was never that there's any reason to go to west Antonica when
you're 50+.  My point was always that I was surprised at the number of
50+ people asking for directions who had apparently never had a level
FIVE character in the area.
