Just last night in burning wood... I pull a sarnak extremist with tashanian
and run. Now if the sarnak doesnt move to cast, I will definitly be out of
range be the time he gets his spell off (I have extended range and sow). But
no, he gets his spell off anyway. Either he casts while running, or he has
insta cast (or close to it). Heck, I have to stop and wait for a whole
second before I cast, lest I get interrupted.
