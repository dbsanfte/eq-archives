I picked a wood elf because they are fast.  Do a test, make a Bar figher and 
run around a bit, then make a wood elf and do the same.  You will be amazed 
at the difference.

And so far I haven't noticed any real difference in the damage I am doing. 
Once I get to a higher level it may make a difference, but now I don't 
really use much melee anyway.
