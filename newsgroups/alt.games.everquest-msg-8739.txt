I stopped using Flame Lick when I got Ignite. Not because I thought it was
"right", just advice I got from another Ranger.

In Ill Omen, this tactic against Sabertooth Grimalkins has netted me loads
of XP! Grimalkins hit very hard, before I "discovered" Panic Animal I would
get down to 20% health in a toe-to-toe fight .... Now whether fear-kiting
animals is "the Ranger way" is another argument -  and for Druids even more
so!

Not had a great deal of success with these, Root I use occasionally but I
prefer Snare. And with so few spell slots ....
