Or your wording sucked. You said 500 person limit. 500 person limit
means 500 PEOPLE IN THE ZONE. If you meant 500 traders, you should
have said "500 trader limit". But, then, I'm sure you used the bad
wording in hopes I'd give you something new to attack me on. (Hey,
it's no more ridiculous than saying SOE is accessing people's
computer's remotely and shutting down their EQ program to save a few
cents here and there on bandwidth)

No, but you do have to say what you mean.

Nice excuse. Anyone else buying this dipshit's fairy tale?
