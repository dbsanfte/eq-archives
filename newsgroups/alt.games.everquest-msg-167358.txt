Difference being that a high level druid can pretty much clean out the
whole valley by himself and take more as they spawn whereas the group
of 35's killing as fast as they can still leaves room for a couple
other groups to hunt them...

A group that's been there among one or two other groups for hours
frankly has more right to them than a single 65 druid who needs some
fast money and just popped into the zone and started cleaning the HGs
out by himself...

Yeah, the .001% of a blue bubble that light blues give at the very
most at that level... And those "some" are ridiculously rare.

>xp for the effort required to kill them.

"Good" xp? No... Moderate, perhaps. The point is, the group of 35-40's
gets noticeable xp off of them, which, combined with the plat, makes
them good hunting. They're honestly getting more out of it overall
than the 54 who runs in for a quick buck...
