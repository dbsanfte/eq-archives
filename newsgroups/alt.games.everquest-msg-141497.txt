I was goofing around in the bazaar the other day when I noticed someone standing
halfway up one of the slanted awning poles, presumably to get a bit of height to be noticed
better.

So, I tried climbing the pole, and sure enough, with some careful maneuvering,
you can climb a pole right to the awning.   Somehow your head pops through.
From there, you can just walk to other awnings.  No levitation required.
