   Nope.  You were right on this one.  This is a petitionable offense.  This is
not accepted roleplay by the majority of the server.  I doubt that Sony would
give you any assistance, but if you want to get other people on the server to
avoid the griefers you can post about them on the  FV community forum,
specifically the Soapbox, at http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie .  

   Griefing in the name of roleplay just gives roleplay a black eye.  And it
pisses most of us "real" roleplayers off.
