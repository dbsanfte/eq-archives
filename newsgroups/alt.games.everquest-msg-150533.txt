    Some of the abilities are really nifty. I love the magician "swarm of
elementals" one, for example. But a lot of them are crap. They either reduce
the timers on existing abilities that nobody uses, or are just poorly
conceived. What level 65 enchanter is going to want to be able to give their
animation pet commands when the last pet they got is very green to them? Why
would they ever use it? And the rogue "evade when moving" ability is pretty
insulting. An AA skill to correct a bug - great!

    We'll also have to see what the "train at 61, 63, 65" means. If it means
"you can train one level if you're 61+, two levels if you're 63+, three
levels if you're 65+" then it won't be so bad. But if, as some people are
interpreting, it means you can only train those skills at level 61, 63, and
65 then it's going to be a headache trying to complete AA skills while under
pressure to level up for new spells. The only reason I think it might be the
latter was the statement that the new levels/AAs would be a "more natural
progression", where a complaint with AA in the past was that even though you
get them at 51 most people wisely wait until 60 to start gaining points.
They might be trying to force people to train AAs at lower levels if they
want them.
