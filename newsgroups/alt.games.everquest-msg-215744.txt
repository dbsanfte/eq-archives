Being a cleric, this issue concerned me a lot, and I did some research into
it. Most of the efficiency tests in this were done with afterlife, or using
scripts. These tests assumed blessed armor of the risen, c3, flowing thought
VIII, 250 wis for the cleric, and mental clarity 3. In this case, a shaman
can heal far more efficiently than a cleric, over a long time. In short time
heals, clerics are still faster and more efficient.

This is convenient, but few battles require short time heals, and any
battles of significance, such as elementals, time, or any cleric of
signifance has got better than 250 wis these days. I mean without any buffs
myself, I have 355 wis, and numerous items that add to my wis. I also
usually have a c5, instead of c3. Flowing thought is usually higher than
VIII these days, and maxxed at 15. Most higher end clerics are using Armor
of the Zealot, or Blessing of the Nine, both have higher regen than BAotR
did. I usually I travel with a beastlord crack as well, for important
encounters. Plus, there is the specialization aspects to have.

Now in EVERY single script ever tested to my knowledge, the cleric
benefitted from specialization checks more than a shaman did. A cleric
benefitted from enchanced mana regen more than a shaman did, and a cleric
benefitted from larger mana pools, and a shaman does not.

I haven't personally ran any scripts, but I might one day just to test it.
Clerics that are well equipped, have the proper aa's, and proper buffs,
should be able to heal more efficiently than a shaman.

Also, these scripts counted on tanks having 4 to 6k of HP, and heals landing
for 2400 hp on average. I know tanks in my own guild, which is far from a
time-ready guild, or even elemental guild, have 6 to 7k of hp. This is the
high end of those scripts, I've met tanks from an elemental guild that have
9 to 11k of hp, and a few from the time-guild on our server that have 12 to
14k of hp. With this amount of hp, the cleric CH can heal for much more than
the shaman or druid's ch on average, and is thus more efficient. Also, the
cleric's critical heals are more frequent, and better than the shamans and
druids. Clerics also can enhance their heals through equipment and aa's, to
heal for almost 25% more. When our fast heal, heals for a base of 1500, and
in the new dungeons, allows more sitting time, and costs the same as a
ch...we can enchance that heal to a little over 1800, and on critical heals,
it heals for 3600.

Also, our aa elixir, and group right click heals from quest leggings (use
them all the time on mounts) add significantly to healing efficiency. The
fact even normal elixirs were omitted from several of these scripts, and I
use them all the time, is distressing.
