<Snip>
I left textures on at high, full clip plane and half the models
loaded.  (Woodies, Humans, Iksar, horses and DE's).  It runs ok for me
now (at least no worse than before).  Here's what I did:

My Spec:PII-450, 512 Ram, 32MB Rage Fury.
Initially when I updated (Added SoL, 4.131.7192 ATI Drivers and DX8.1)
and and ran under Win 98SE it was choppy as hell.
I have two hard drives, so I moved my swap file to a different drive
to my EQ installation, and ramped it up to 400MB (from 200MB - I only
recently increased ram from 320 (2*128+2*+32) to 512 (4*128) Ram.

Moving the swap file seemed to help a lot, as now two sets of disk
platters and heads were working on churning data around, instead of
one.  I have a permanent swap file too, not one that windows can grow
and shrink as it pleases.  This leads to a very heavily fragmented
swap file which makes performance dog slow.

As my machine is dual boot with Win2K, I downloaded the NT/Win2K
versions of the ATI Drivers and DX8.1 and installed them.  I had tried
to run EQ before in Win 2K but the previous DX versions or vid drivers
didnt seem to work for me, so I went back to '98.  I ran the game from
Win 2K (no need to reinstall, just run EverQuest.exe from your
explorer) and it ran fine.  Very little churning and even with lots of
peeps / mobs milling about it seemed to handle it.

In summary, what worked for me was:
*512 MB Ram
*400 MB PERMANENT Swap file (on another physical drive if possible)
*Win 2K - makes much more efficient use of the RAM 
*Keep HD(s) defragged as much as possible.  If you have Norton
Utilities all the better as it will optimise your swap / page files as
well as your hard disk.


My 2 cents.  HTH.
