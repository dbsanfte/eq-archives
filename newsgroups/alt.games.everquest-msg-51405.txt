Hello and greetings all,

I'm a youngish Half-elf warrior, and during my rather limited travelling, i've
heard about "Epic" weapons...

As i'm only level 14, i'm thinking that it's a long way off, but i'm just
curious as to what kind of weapon my class's epic is, how strong, and basically
what it looks like...

I've seen what i believe is the Shaman epic more than a few times(long staff or
polearm with a REALLY cool swirling skull thingy at the hilt...), and if i ever
get the option of using something even remotely as cool as it, i'd love to
know.

Thanks to anyone who answers.
