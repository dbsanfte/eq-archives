The AC in sro is a free for all mob on my server.  It's ok to KS
others but the same may happen to you.  It's not uncommon for 5
different people to be hitting it at once.  Whoever loots the ring
usually gets congradulated too.  My advice is next time be the one
doing the KSing.  Do not hunt it without a lvl 50+ caster helping. 
Melee classes, especially below lvl 50 are setting themselves up for
dissapointment by camping the AC.  Hunt it in the AM hours when most
people are sleeping.  Finally have a lot of patience and cross your
fingers because a lot of it is luck.
