}Here's the reason. Most necros will want some juicy gear in their
}offhand as well as their main hand. The effect presumably has a long
}long cast time and is a lower version of the fear spell.

I was talking to a necro about this item the other night... he said that the 
reason it's desirable is that its fear -stacks- with the normal necro fear.

It sounds silly, but if that's true, it would make it very, very valuable 
indeed, since fear would almost never break.  He was a guildie, and was not 
trying to sell one, so he was probably honestly believed that at least.
