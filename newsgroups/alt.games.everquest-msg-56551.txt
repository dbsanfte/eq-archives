I was on the boat from BB Mountains on my way to EFP. Anyways, I left my
computer for like 5 minutes to get something to munch on. When I come back I
see myself rising high in the sky. I'm like holy hell. I'm being raised on to
the very top of the ship along with the flag. It was very weird. I looked from
different views and I was on the very tippy top of the ship flag pole lol. I
moved one speck and fell 300 feet to the deck and died. The guide said that was
one he never heard of before and summoned my body to the OOT sister island.
Just wondered if anyone else has had this happen before. Thanks
