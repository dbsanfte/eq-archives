If they were a tightly-clustered group of 52+, it could be a successful adventure in any
dungeon.

Above 52 we have a 410-hp, 1/4-tick cast, quick-heal with a just-over-1-tick recast.
Above 44 we have a 400-hp, 1/4-tick cast, 4-tick HoT with a 5-tick recast.  Put a couple
of us together, keep us focused and C3'd, and we're a healing machine.

Our DPS isn't the highest, but give me a War Marshall's Bladed Staff and I'm good for 35+
DPS with my self-cast ghetto haste.  And there are higher-ratio undroppable weapons, that
I haven't held yet.  A trio of Pallys, similarly equipped, could slice and dice pretty
efficiently.

For a 6-pally LDoN adventure, you'd play your hand like this: 3x on melee, 2x on heals,
and 1x on crowd control and backup heals.  Everyone wears C3, HoV and their own buffs.

Man, just thinking about the ability to Pacify a whole room of MOBs in one 6-pally casting
wave, has got me all a-giggle.

Best regards,
