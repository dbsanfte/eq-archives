Interesting - I knew ATK is comprised of an Accuracy portion (skill based)
and a damage portion (STR derived), but for some reason I'd assumed an ATK
of 950 with a STR of say 150 would yield exactly the same damage output as
an ATK of 950 with a STR of 70 and some pure ATK buffs.

Anyway, I headed off to Paineel and did some informal testing with the
Erudite near the Warrens, around 100 swings per test:

Unbuffed: 269 STR, 1002 ATK, 82 max hit.
Crippled and some STR gear removed: 154 STR, 899 ATK, 53 max hit.
STR gear replaced: 189 STR, 931 ATK, 72 max hit.
Cripple removed and Focus applied: 305 STR, 1034 ATK, 84 max hit.

Now, those tests were pretty unscientific, but they seem to show STR having
a *much* bigger effect than I realised. It'll be interesting to see if the
new cap breaking Focus in Omens will make a boost in that max hit....
