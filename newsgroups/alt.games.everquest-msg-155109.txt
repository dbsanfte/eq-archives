Reason I'm asking for Martin (anybody with experience can answer too) is
because I know for a fact you've done the 10th Ring War in GD.  My brother
has started the ring quests and we have done all of them by ourselves up to
the 6th.  We don't see the 7th a problem, the 8th & 9th could be done with
the help from our guild but the 10th one I think might just be out of reach
for us.  How many groups and what lvls should we have to do the 10th ring?
Also, any tips on how it can be done would help also.

As an alternative, I know this is a long shot, but if our guild isn't big
enough to do it, is it possible to have people from your guild help do it.
We wouldn't have much to offer that you guys would need but my brother would
only want to loot the head for the 10th ring and all other loot can be had
by your guild ( like you want any of it anyways but it's the thought that
counts, right? ;)

Any info would be appreciated, thanks in advance.
