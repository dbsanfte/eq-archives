Reminds me of a time when myself (and some others) taught their dog
something.  He had chewed through the cord to their Super Nintendo
controller.  Anyone who had an SNES (at least back in their first few years)
knew those cords were about 10 feet long (8 at shortest).  The dog only bit
completely through a few of the 7 inside wires.  Being a copper fiber like
threading, they couldn't easily be spliced back together (well, their father
was a carpenter not an electrician), so that one was useless now.  To teach
the dog a lesson, we encouraged it (over the next week or two) to finish
eating the rest of it.  So that's somewhere between 56-84 feet (weather it
was 8 or 12 feet times 7 wires) of copper thread and plastic wire coating.
The dog NEVER chewed any more wires of any kind after that (or even got them
in it's mouth).
    My other suggestion is to get an AC adapter (just a cheap one...doesn't
need to be worth much).  Plug it into a 220V outlet, and dampen the carpet
below it (salt water conducts better) then let the dog chew on it.  If
you're worried about causing an electrical fire, then you can leave out the
dampening the carpet part.  But substitution (or adding for additional
effect) can be to let the dog loose on this just after a bath, or coming in
from the rain, or wet yard (only the bottoms of their feet need to be wet to
ensure proper grounding).
