OK, I been playing less than two months and it seems that once a week
the servers are all down for some sort of update.

Is this the way things alwaays go in this game??? Are there weekly
patches that shut everything down for a whole, or the better part of,
the day??

It's kind of frustrating to be locked out so much. Is this the way it
always goes on in this game??
