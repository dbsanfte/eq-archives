dont mean to support the pirate or nutin, but you cant go to jail for
pirATING GAMES..reason?..
its a civil offence and only can have hardware confiscATED and/or be
fined/sued by software companies
whereas u go to jail for a criminal offence, eg
i crash into u drink driving, the criminal offence as breaking law and
go to jail, but the civil offence is hurting u aND U SUE ME FOR
DAMAGES!
dont mean to sound nerdy but hey, luv CM!
