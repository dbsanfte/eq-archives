If EQ is dead, I've already been buried.

It still has the single largest player base in the US, afaict.

Now it may be difficult to get lower level groups, but the lower levels are
easier than they have ever been, especially if you get Shadows of Luclin and
pick up some gear from the bazaar cheap.

Also, once  you get to your late 30s iirc, you can get the Lost Dungeons
expansion, and there's dozens of people looking for adventures... short,
focused single group dungeons you have all to yourselves.

Then of course, EQ is the content king. Of all the games I've played and
seen, nothing else has the real estate to get yourself lost in that EQ does.
