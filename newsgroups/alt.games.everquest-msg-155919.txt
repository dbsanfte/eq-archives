Well, "maybe".  No way to be sure without knowing what all is in
PoP (it's going to have many features that no one knows about just yet),
and knowing what's important to you.

But what is known is that PoP will have some mechanism which makes it
easier to move characters from place to place (like an extension to
the Luclin Nexus transportation system), which ought to be useful
to your Bard and Shaman.

There's also a "Plane of Knowledge" which is supposed to be
chock-filled with new quests and some sort of information library
that is aimed at helping players get info (presumably like the
EQ info websites do now).

Yes.
