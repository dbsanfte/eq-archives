Not by a long shot.....I still get routinely pestered for them on my
halfelf ranger.
I've had rude tells having a go at me for ignoring people woh are asking
when there is a group of people standing there, the asker is using say and
two of the others ARE druids. 
One person who I guess I must have been slightly annoyed at for the 7 or 8
persistent atempts to get me to port them asked 'well how the hell am I
supposed to know you are a ranger' then told me that doing a /who was a
waste of his time and another who said 'yes but if you have a 50+ ranger
you are pretty likely to have decent level druid who you can log on for
the port, its not like Im scrounging I did offer 5pp'

It does make for a busy /ignore list :)
