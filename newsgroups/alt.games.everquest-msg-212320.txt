Drakes fly fixed routes.  Just watch where you are going and don't kite
anything over one, and they aren't a bother.  When you reach high enough
level, the Drakes will ignore you even if you kite right over them (as long
as you don't hit them with an AOE spell, of course!).  I don't recall what
level is high enough.  Defintely 55.  I'm pretty sure 54 was high enough.
Not sure about 53 or 52.

Drakes aren't all that hard to kill.  I'm a Wizard, and I could nuke them
from outside the range of their spell (or perhaps I just nuked faster, so
when they stopped and we tried to nuke each other from the edge of spell
range, I finished and was running before they finished, so I got out of
range?).  Druid spells might be too slow for this, though.

Main thing in Cobalt Scar is to make sure you know where Yvolcarn is.
Unlike the unnamed wyverns, he will take exception to your killing things
near him.  And, since he cannot be rooted or snared, getting his attention
pretty much means gating.  (Even if you can kill him, he is not factionless
like the wyverns and drakes, so you probably don't want to).  There's also a
named Drake to watch out for.  I've heard he's not nice, but don't know what
in particular is not nice about him.

Here are some ther places you might check out.  Some of these might be a
little tough at 52, but it can't hurt (much) to take a look.

1. Someone already mentioned Katta.  In addition to the guards they
mentioned, the guards and wolves outside Nathyn's place might be good.  They
are on a separate faction, so you won't become KOS anywhere other than at
Nathyn's place, and you will gain vampire faction (nice when you turn a
corner and run into the Coterie Assasin in the middle of a quad) and some
Seru factions.  All blue through 58, and still blue often enough at 59 to
still be good.  Decent loot, too.

2. Check out the Tro Jeg on the top of the mesa in Scarlet Desert.
Significant blues through 59.  Lots of light blue at 60.

3. Emerald Jungle.  Near the TT zone is a nice spot.  You can med up on the
wall, where you can see things go buy, and pick out blues.  Hard to see, so
sometimes you'll run into extras, but you can just run to the TT zone.

4. Burning Woods...try the hornets.

5. Eastern Wastes.  In the Southwest, there is a field of Walrus' and Uthork
Men of War.  The Men of War will be blue all the way through 55.  The
Walrus' are occasionally blue that long.  I think they might be mainly blue
at 52.  The Walrus' have relatively low HP for their level, I believe.
North of there, out from the Kael entrance, there are Manticors and various
Mammoth and Rhino things that should be blue.  Also Snow Griffons.  Plenty
of animals if you want to try charming.  Watch out for the Kromif Death
Squad!

6. Jaggedpine?  I was 55 when it came out, and appeared to be just barely
too high.

You could go to Graffe's and read the Wizard soloing and quadding guides.
Many spots that are good for Wizards would be good for Druids.
