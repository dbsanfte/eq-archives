I was amused by the "waiting for a group or raid?" line.   Since most
serious raid groups I know of require level 65... and the task system stops
at level 65.... when are you going to use this waiting for a raid?

In any event, not something I'll get to experiment with soon.  My warrior
will be 66 tonight, and my rogue is 65 already.

Haha...  I think you captured the essence of my response to this one as

All I know is the rumors, and someone on another board posted what the
effects were for 2.0 and 1.5    Supposedly 1.5 will be completable by a
single group, while 2.0 will be the raid version.

Well, yeah... but not due to this change.   More no more "ok, twink / sell

Unless they changed it so no-drop items can be tributed.

None of my characters have ever had  a last name.   A left over aversion
from the 1999 days, when dinging level 20 was the ultimate status symbol
that everyone obsessed over.    I refused to do it.   Literally ; )   The GM
showed up to give my partner her last name... asked what mine would be, and
my response was "I cannot, for I was born a bastard.  My father never
acknolwedged me, and I refuse to take his name."

This is actually one of the changes I'm looking forward to most.   I've had
to suffer with "Marshall Dearic" for entirely too long.

I wonder if you replace one, does it play the new one when someone sends you
that specific message?  Or does it transfer it when you want to send somone
else that message?

Would almost have to be that it was just changing the macro for what you
hear.

I really hope so.  I don't see it as being any more useful than text
messages typed real fast, or hotkeys hit.   And I don't like having my sound
off.

Supposedly the new AA's will be "reasonably priced" instead of "GoD
level"... but I guess we wont' really know until  the servers come back up.
My bet is level 66 for a minimum requirement, but I guess like some GoD
ones, they might have it as low as 55.

One slot per level.  We'll have to see how many levels you're allowed to
purchase.

Hah. Actually it is probably going to be more useful than I thought...
since I'm starting to edge back into raid tanking, I'm finding I need to
fiind slots for more and more buffs that I didn't need as a DPS melee.  DI,
ward of *, rune, etc.

Certainly not me.   I'll turn it on once to see it... but the performance is
*much* more important to me than the eye candy.

Yeah.  Heh... not even sure I would  notice dynamic shadows without looking
for it.   Why slow everything down for something so little?

Turn all crap off, not just the new one : P   I'm still not using luclin
graphics crap.

This one I'm really suprised by.  I like it at first glance, but I never
thought I would see it.

Never was right that one person had to foot the bill for party buffs,
creating annoyances trying to figure out how much was getting spent on it.

Truly, my heart bleeds for them.

This is actually much less of a nerf than what the rumors were before.

Again, boo hoo hoo.

No idea.   Maybe they could... you know, group?

This is the one that I hadn't even heard rumors of.   Guess no more "grats
rot"... unless theres some kind of restrictions like you can't zone with it
or can't bank it.  No more ninja looting on raids, as one of the leaders can
just grab the items, then give them to the person who is supposed to recieve
it.

I really am not sure what they're after with this?  Are all servers going to
be taking a big step towards FV's "nothing is no-drop" policy because of it?
Will people end up selling "non-attuned" raid loot in the bazaar and stuff?

*shrug*... in your case it doesn't work well, since you don't like to do
AA's... just the leveling.   For a lot of people though, it works fine.

And they're not really trying to fix the class through this one change.
Just fixing the lack of AA's

How exactly does pet pulling work?   The more I hear about it, the more I
