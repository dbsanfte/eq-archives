Like I said, people/guilds tend to respect killing forces
(or a force close to a killing force) in place.  Otherwise
PnP would be invoked all the time on about every raid mob...

Yeah, you can't hold *any* camp in the game without a force
capable of clearing the spawns, right?  So *every* mob in the
game is, essentially, FCFS.  That's "bantering words."  I've
seen clerics *by themselves* *on an alt monk/necro/SK who can
FD* declare Ragefire camped.  Uh, no.  And they wonder why
people don't respect their camps...
