I keep comatose (Dulak harbor spell quest) and death peace loaded when
I know I'm gonna have trouble getting some place. Like the ratman in
chardok caves. A couple times DP failed and I got up and hit comatose.

I'd say both kinda handy. Oh and you might want to look into getting
the 9th spell gem. Helps alot and only 3 AAs.
