Took me a long time to learn this, but the server still can think you
are running for a shockingly long time after you take your finger off
the forward or backward arrow key and see yourself "stopped".  However,
what forces the server to recongnize this is a slight turn. I pull with
spells every day and have to use this to stay alive.

When you finish moving and come to a stop, turn slightly to the left or
right. This will reduce instances of interruption majorly.
