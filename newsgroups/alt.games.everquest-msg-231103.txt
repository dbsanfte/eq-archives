Maybe for warriors.  How many HP does a necromancer get per stamina
point?

LOL, and some people swear by dexterity for procs and crits.

Perhaps that is the only real points of contention.  I have tried to
balance my stats between stamina and dexterity.  My stamina is now
much higher.

It was just one more reason.  So why do you pretend it was the only
reason?

By don't expect, I mean you don't expect to be offtanking.

That has been my experience.  Perhaps it is different for your
character(s).

My original post on the subject:
"The only reason I would disagree is that dexterity, which is also
quite important, seems to be tougher to raise than stamina.  Although
those gems of deftness that drop in LDON zones are nice."

You responded to it.  How could you foget so quickly what my point
was?

"They" say that charisma also affect how likely a harmony spell is to
aggro if it fails.  "They" say that it improves the likelihood that a
charm will go full duration.  "They" say that it affect how much of a
positive or negative hit you get from faction mobs.

If it was my experience that I managed to max all of my stats except
charisma, I just might make such a claim.  Yeah the other stats will
help you more than charisma, but since you will be maxing them out
really easily, don't worry about them.

See how that works?  You could argue that everything should go in to
charisma without thinking it is the king shit of all stats.

I have had the exact opposite experience.
