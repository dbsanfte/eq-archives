For wisdom up to 200, the formula is unchanged and is
Level*2+Level*Wisdom/5, or Level*(2+Wisdom/5) if you prefer.  So each point
of wisdom gets you 0.2 mana per level.  So, at level 60, each point of
wisdom is worth 12 mana.  So, yes, at level 60, each point of wisdom over
200 is worth a bit less than one half the mana that each point of wisdom up
to 200 is worth.

For wisdom over 200, level is not relevant, each point of wisdom gets you
5.8 mana, at level 1, or at level 60.

At level 1, each point of wisdom over 200 gets you 29 times as much mana as
each point of wisdom up to 200.  So, twinking out a low level caster with
gear that puts his/her Wis/Int up to 255 makes a huge difference in mana
pool early on.  At level one, with 255 wisdom, you are looking at 361 mana,
vs with wisdom of 200 having 42 mana.  That 55 extra wisdom gets you 319
mana, regardless of level.  Even if you wait til level 6 to do the twinking,
it's still a huge boost to the mana pool, you would get 252 mana at 200
wisdom at level 6, vs 571 mana at 255 wisdom.  At level 60, that 319 extra
mana is nowhere near as significant, as even at 200 wisdom, at level 60, you
would have 2520 mana.  It seems to be highly encouraging twinking.
