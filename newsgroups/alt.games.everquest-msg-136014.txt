Just to add to this:
/show 1
will show nothing but first names.  Cuts down a bit.

/hidecorpse all
will hide all corpses but your own (also damned handy in the Freeport 
bank and other areas where morons like to go to dump 100 corpses - just 
make sure to turn it back ON before looking for a friend's corpse :))

When moving around the bazaar or trying to work with your inventory 
(moving stuff around, taking out coin, etc), look down at the ground, or 
at an empty wall.  This alone almost completely gets rid of the lag I 
suffer while moving.

Also, a friend told me turning off 3d sky helps a lot.  I didn't have 
time to do anymore before they took the game down last night, and I 
*think* I have it turned off anyway, but he said it helped him a lot 
with lag.
