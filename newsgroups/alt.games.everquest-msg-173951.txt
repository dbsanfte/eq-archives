The theory that items should go to people for whom they are upgrades.  Abused so chronically that
this term is usually avoided even when the principle is being followed, instead try "those who
can and will use".

Problems with this:

1) people often lie about whether they need something at all, so they can take the thing and sell
it.
2) the person who gets the item then usually takes his discard and sells that, so he pockets cash
as well as the improvement
3) while items may be upgrades for many people, there's a lot of variation as to how much a given
item will actually improve different people
4) Greed works universally; take an item, sell it in the bazaar, and you can buy something that
will benefit you... so all droppable items are really an upgrade for anyone.  NBG benefits only a
few classes for any given item, and tends to benefit liars more than the honest.

Yes, although also RNG = Ranger.  People claim that they have bad luck with the RNG.  This is a
spiritual position, not a logical one.

Dragon Kill Points.  For reasons lost in the mists of time, systems which reward people points
for raiding or other activities, and then have them use those points to decide how dropped items
are distributed, often refer to these as "dragon kill points" or DKP, despite the fact that most
points are not earned by killing dragons.
