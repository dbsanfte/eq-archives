I agree with your post but the OP's post dealt with the beginning number
stats and since racial traits weren't a factor in that I just deep-sixed
them for clarity. I believe EQ2 is putting in racial traits (clickable as
I've witnessed with Infravision) for most all races. I don't know much more
about it than that for now so I'll not comment further on it.

Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel ashamed. Then
I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of
their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of
work and their dreams would be shattered. Then I say to myself, 'It is
better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than to be
selfish and worry about my liver.'
