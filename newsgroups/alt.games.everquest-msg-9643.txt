For the DE guards kill Halflings, if you can get into the Nek forest
anymore.  As for the other 2 I'm not sure.  I think by killing the undead
frogs in LGuk you fix the regular frog faction, but you'd have to kill a lot
of froggies.

 I've killed about 10 DE Guards, Lady Shea about 20
 Times, and last night I learned that you don't kill the Frogs in the swamp,
or what else, "You Lose faction"

Is this just a Shadow Knight Thing, and can I ever regain my faction?
