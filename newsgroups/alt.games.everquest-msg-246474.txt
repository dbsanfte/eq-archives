No, there is very famous little dog who sees invis and regularly roams the
hallway from from the zone-in (Quinim to Barindu). He is not always there,
but when he is he patrols that long U-hallway, sometimes near the left wall,
sometimes near the right. You can avoid him if you notice that he cons
"scowls, ready to attack" instead of indifferent. But he's caught so many
people unaware in that hallway, it's a crime.

There are also a whole series of archers that roam around the courtyard
between the zone-in to Ferubi and the entrance to the trials, that area in
there. A couple of them also walk behind the building that houses the High
Priest and will often suprise anyone speaking with Udranda, the Apprentice,
getting a vxed or tipt trial. These are the heartseekers and eyecollectors.
If any of them spot you, you've got a BIG problem coming down on you. Best
bet is to run for the Ferubi zone (I've got that run hard coded into memory
now).
