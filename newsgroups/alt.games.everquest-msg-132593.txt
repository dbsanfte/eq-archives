}> Or the fact that druids are the second best nukers in the game.
}are they really ? is nuking a critical ability?
}A wizard is twice as good a nuker as a druid. Would it suprise you so much

}comparable over a 2 minute spread?

Wow, it suprised me.  I initially read you wrong, so I was comparing with 
the 3097 damage in a minute for 1020 mana... When I get to level 60, my 58 
nuke can do 675 every 8 seconds, for 3375 in 40 seconds.  But that takes 
1250 mana.  And if I have the Ancient spell by some miracle, it's 3875.

And if I alternate my Dementia and Dementing Visions Nukes, it's still 675 
per, but every 6 seconds... 6750 damage a minute for only 2500 mana...

Wow.

Screw this crowd control shit, I wanna nuke!

Oh.  But wizzies are much better nukers.  Enchanters must be balanced! I 
want manaburn!
