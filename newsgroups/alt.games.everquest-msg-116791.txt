When is the last time you installed it?  Seriously, pop in the CD, hit 
workstation, answer a couple questions about timezone, and go.  It really 
is that easy.  I went to lunch and came back and it was done.  Not how I 
would have done the partioning and all, but you don't even have a choice 
in Windows.

Uglier?  Eye of the beholder and all.  I personally have a setup that I'm 
quite fond of, though if I really wanted it to look like Windows, there 
are themes that look EXACTLY like windows, down to the start button.

I use Linux every single day.  I live in the terminal window.  This is 
being written in a terminal window (though on a BSD box that I ssh to from 
my Linux box).  There is NOTHING the average user needs to access that 
can't be done from the GUI.  The few things that an admin needs to do that 
aren't covered by the GUI are roughly equivilant to registry settings on 
your average XP/2k box.  Saying not to open a terminal window is about the 
same as telling a Windows user not to use the start button, it doesn't 
make sense.

What version of Linux.  Seriously, it is leaps and bounds above where it 
was 2 year ago, and completely and utterly different than it was 2 year 
before that.  I first tried to install it in 97, right after getting 
FreeBSD working on my laptop.  I couldn't make it work, and the Linux 
geeks in my office couldn't either.  By 99 I could do a basic workstation 
install pretty much solo.  By last year I started a new job and was given 
two computers, one for Linux, one for XP.  I started the installs at the 
same time and found the Linux install much faster.  When I started my most 
recent position about 6 months ago, I needed less than half the time to 
install Linux vs. 2K, and I didn't need my XP Uberadmin friend to figure 
out the more esoteric issues.

Installed base is hard to change.  No doubt about that.  I will say that 
going from Windows to Linux would be easier than Windows to Mac now.  
Seriously, play with Linux on a newer computer, using a consumer version 
of Linux, and see what you think.  Remember that you can't do much of 
anything with a default Windows install, and even a Dell or whatever 
commercial box you buy generally won't have all the applications you need 
to use every day.  Spend a day on tucows finding and downloading browsers 
and newsreaders and mail clients and IM clients etc.  Just like you do 
with your new Windows box.  Make it a fair comparison.
