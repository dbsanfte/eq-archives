Other people have different experiences. And it's really only going to
get worse as more and more people get multiple characters at the cap.
Reputation means nothing when you can replace your character virtually
overnight with a new one at max level.

There is no accountability in SB at all, and that's not going to be
fun times for people who want MEANINGFUL PvP. That part is the UO
ganker's wet dream come true, and by accounts I've seen there's
already a large ganker population and its growing bigger, bigger than
all the other populations combined, though its limited to certain
areas still.

As I said, from the sounds of it its actually easier for the griefers
to get numbers together than the antis.

Tell the truth, now... given you can have a max rank character in mere
days, aren't you the least bit tempted to make one as a throwaway mass
murderer for stress relief?

If you're not, you're a better person than me.
