This didn't work when Beastlord Warder's zoned, because it would still
increment a numeric. Each time you entered a zone your pet would
increment. Khosh's Warder_01 would eventually become Khosh's Warder_99
if you spent a lot of time in a zone (logging in/out, zoning etc). At
that point you could no longer have a pet in the zone until the next
server reset, because the number wouldn't roll over. I am not sure if
they ever fixed this or not. Now that Warders are the same as other
summoned pets, I haven't seen the issue come up.
