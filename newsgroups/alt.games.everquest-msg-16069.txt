The misunderstanding here is that the requirements aren't simply used as a
bar to anyone wishing to join. They are to ensure that any new members are
capable of taking part in guild activities. We have this problem in my
guild. It's an old guild with a lot of long-standing lower level players. We
also allow RL family of existing members to join. Now, the majority of our
online time is spent raiding. Not because of some decision in the past to
form "an uberguild", but over the last 18 months the core members have
reached the mid-high-50s and the guild roster has swelled enough for us to
raid well and often. When we raid, despite all the warnings these lower
levels were given then they signed up, we get the inevitable whinging from
these people about not being able to join in. Frankly, it's just irritating.
But we aren't the kind of guild to kick these people out because they don't
fit into "the plan".
Just after Kunark came out and the game changed radically, the small guild
of friends I had played with since starting out collapsed. Well, sufficient
people left the game to mean we couldn't muster a regular 50+ group any
more. I was friends with a larger guild and had learned the raiding ropes by
going along and helping them out. They were recruiting because most of their
raids were multiguild affairs and they wanted to do things themselves. It
was a crossroads for me. I had a choice. I could quit the game as many of my
friends had, or I could push on to bigger things. I decided there were
things in this game I wanted to see and experience still - the "High End
Game". So I joined the larger guild. And they recruited more people. We
found ourselves competently clearing the Planes and killing the old Gods. We
stepped up to Venril Sathir and Trakanon, then PoG, WW Dragons then Dojo and
Velketor. Soon there will be ToV, vengeance on Klandicar etc, All the time
we have been the same friendly guild at heart. I'm conquering these mobs
with the people I've been friends with since Blackburrow. Are we uber? Does
this make us elitist pricks? We have similar (though not so stringent)
requirements for entering our guild. Given the surplus of Druids and
Paladins we are all ready carrying it is almost impossible for a person of
this class to join. So like I say, it's about being able to include all your
members in guild activities. It ain't just about keeping people out.

PS: I can't help but sense a whiff of jealousy in these uberguild-bashing
posts. Most people, given the opportunity, would love to see the sights,
kill the baddies and loot the goodies that the 'uberguilds' do :)
