Speaking for myself, yes.  I played a necro through 30 and loved it.
I don't have oodles of time to spend in EQ so when this was offered I
took it.  Had him now for a few months and very much love the
character/class.  Much more fun than my 64 monk that I've slaved with
for years (well 65 as of last night).
