The quickest way: kill something that drops something people want to pay
for.  Forest Loop = 300p, and it would take you alot longer to farm the pp
by killing mobs for cash and vendor loot.

This was quite a delimma for me before I realized that there is no "payday"
mob that you kill and are instantly loaded with money.  There are some mobs
like Giants that drop sometimes close to 50p, but for the most part its the
50 mobs you kill that drop 4-6p each.

My advice is to camp mobs that have good drops that other will want to buy,
or have a good resale on there own.
