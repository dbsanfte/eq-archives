The food item most upper/left in your inventory is the one next up to
be eaten, and the one that will be adding stats.  Even if that means
its in a bag in slot eight, even if its in the tenth slot in that bag, as
long as there is no food in an earlier slot, thats the one.

Hunger is based, not on what you are currently eating, but on
what you ate last.  When you become hungry, you eat the item
"next up"

If that empties the "next up" slot, then you go to the next upper/left
food item for stat checks, and so forth till you run out of food.

Verant included a means of "force eating" food by clicking on it.
Force fed food only fills you up half as much as if you'd eaten it
naturally.  Why would you want to do this?  Well, if you force
feed food, then you can preserve the good stats food item in
your "next up" slot indefinately.

While I haven't seen any statment from Verant on the issue
of how food is "intended" to work, I think this is good circumstantial
evidence for the idea that this is a feature, not a bug.

Of course the fact that force feeding was introduced before
stat foods or even food of varying duration does weaken
that arguement...

At any rate, I'll add a suggestion.  I keep my stat food
in my top slot, and I have an open inventory slot bottom right
where I keep junk food (fish rolls or something) to eat.  I
tie the bottom right slot to my left arrow key (sense heading
tied to my right) so I am constantly trying to eat another
fish roll.  As long as the rolls hold out, this prevents me from
ever getting hungry and eating my Misty Thicket Picnic, which
is far more difficult to assemble, but provides great stats.  Prior
to doing this, a picnic would last me no more than a day or two
before I'd forget to force munch on snacks for too long and
accidentally eat the thing.  Have had this arrangement for
at least a week and still have the same stack of 4 picnics sitting
in the "next up" slot!
