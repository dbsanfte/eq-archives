I have played EQ for quite awhile on both, and I can say they both
work equally well. First a little background on the different
operating systems. Win98SE is basically an upgrade to Win95, and this
line of operating systems died out after Windows Me. Win2K is an
upgrade to NT4.0, and both versions of XP come from Win2K. XP home is
a slightly stripped down version of XP Pro. XP Home is a big
improvement over Win98SE, but somewhat of a downgrade from Win2K Pro,
as it doesn't have the network support and enhanced administration
features of the Pro level operating systems, which you as a gamer
probably don't care about. XP Pro is only a slight upgrade from Win2K
Pro. That being said, the Pro versions are going to be much more
expensive than XP Home, simply because they are aimed at businesses
instead of home users. They cost around twice as much. Also, since XP
Home is aimed at consumers, that is the OS that game manufacturers are
going to be directly supporting. Most everything should work under XP
Pro, but compatability is not as sure a thing under Win2K. No reason
why things _shouldn't_ work, but it's not the OS they're going to be
working for compatibility on. End advice is: XP Home is probably going
to be the best bang for your buck, and the OS that will get the most
support. Unless you really need the enhanced networking and
administration features of Win2K Pro or XP Pro, go with XP Home.

As for the hard drive thing, Win98SE supports hard drives over 12GB
just fine. Your mobo bios may need to be upgraded to recognize the
larger disks. Check the web site of your hardware manufacturer.
