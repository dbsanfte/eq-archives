Pretty sure all they get is more headaches.  Senior Guides are still Guides
which means they don't get paid.

I'm also pretty sure that the best/easiest way to become Sr Guide is simply
to put up with shit longer than other guides...I imagine the turn-over is
pretty high.

I mean, you're forced to WORK 26 (6hrs x 4.33 weeks per month) hours a month
crappy little $12.95 savings?  That's roughly 50 cents an hour to be able to
help people out between being hassled by asshole players.

Senior Guide undoubtedly means more administrative BS...time spent out of
the game.

The only real benefit to being a guide is the occasional player who
appreciates what you've done for them.
