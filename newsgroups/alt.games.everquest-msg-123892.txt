Hi:

A simple question really, can the Wizard's Epic be mutli-quested, and if it
can .. how does one do it? My 59 level Wizard has the green oil dropped from
the Enraged Golem so I turn that into the NPC and am given one of the three
Staffs I need, I then turn these three Staffs in to another NPC and am given
the Staff of the Four.

It seems to me that MQing the Wizard Epic couldn't be done, though I'm
always seeing MQ items for Epic available in the auction channel ...

Thanks for your time, safe hunting to you all ...

Stevie.
