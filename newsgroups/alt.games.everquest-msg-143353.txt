I am curious, if I buy spider silk in the bazaar, is it typical to spend 5pp
per stack (20) of silk or 5pp for just 1?

Then it's still cheap on your server. I undercut everyone else on Drinal
when I sell it for 10pp.  Most people are selling for 20-25pp ea.  It's
outrageous but I guess some people are paying it.
