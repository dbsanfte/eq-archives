You put in a quarter at the arcade and nothing happens you complain. 
They guy at the desk gives you a quarter, and makes a note of the event 
if it happens again he verifies it/ and/or calls the game supplier and 
they come fix it....

At no stage in this effective and functioning chain of events does 
anyone just say... "its a just a game and a lousy quarter... shove off". 
That would accomplish nothing at all, except to piss off a customer, and 
leaves a defective system in place to piss off the next customer too.
