I'm also seeing this a lot on my system

1.  Game Locks up in POK (normally when i enter)
2.  Wait 2-3 Minutes for syncronisation so i can log back on
3.  The second i log back on it crashes again (within a second)

If im logging into POK then it seems to run a high risk of it locking up,
once im in and running about the risk seems to lower.......although its
still there.
