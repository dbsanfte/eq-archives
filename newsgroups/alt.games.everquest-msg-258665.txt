Well you get sneak and hide no matter what race you play, though
Halflings do get that small advantage.  Humans are night blind.  Only
Tunare followers (Elves) can equip a few items such as Helm of the
Tracker while there is one Karana-only weapon--SBoT--which is so-so. 
(Humans and Halflings will worship Karana).   As for my opinion
though, having leveled up a Human Karana Ranger, night blindness
caused me almost no trouble, ever.  Worshipping Karana used to prevent
me from getting a few nice weapons but recent changes took care of
that...there really is no compelling reason to bother with one race
over the other.

...another thing I was thinking about except that the BP itself could
blow your whole budget.

I'm pretty sure they do, not sure how useful they are...

Yeah, 2/tic.  Whoopie.

This is a Ranger.  He casts heals on himself.  The regen is nice but
it is less important than it is for other melee.  Heck, does a
Solstice Earring work at level 1?  If so that might be a good idea
too.

The easiest thing to do is minimize the track window.  You continue to
update it but it won't "restore" to normal size.  You can place it up
in the corner and ignore it.  Whenever you do want to see what's on
track, "restore" it.

1hs and 2hs are most important, at least for most Rangers.  Screw
piercing.  Maybe work on 1hb or even 2hb...that's up to you since
there are usually some nice blunt weapons for Rangers but not nearly
as many as slashing.

He's a pretty good soloer, even in the 50's, as far as melee go.  It's
boring as hell to fearkite animals in your 50's but its faster than
trying to straight-melee stuff with your average melee class.
