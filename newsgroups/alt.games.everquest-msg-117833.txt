heh... I know this one.

I have a wood elf druid and a human monk and an erudite chanter.

Solo, slay something rough for a solo, then (hide | feign) and go (clean up 
| play with pets | play with wife | watch a movie).

What I wonder is how much of my /played on my druid was spent staring at 
that godawful book.
