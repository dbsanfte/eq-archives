Why is it that people think there is only one way to play EQ?

Of course you are right, in a full party, where someone is pulling fast
a cleric has thier hands full healing, but there are other interesting
party configurations that allow a cleric to use some of their other
spells and abilities.

I have a friend who mostly soloed a dwarven cleric to 45....

And there are blue giants that kick the crap out of my 39 lvl Ranger
and blue giants I can solo without taking a bubble of damage..

All to true, full parties need members to take on specific roles to
insure the sucess of the group.

But, there is more than one way to play a cleric and different party
configurations which work and are fun. One of my all time fun moments
was at around level 30 my wife(cleric) and I(enchanter), busted into paw
when nobody was in the zone. We got in a fight with 3 gnolls and came a
fraction of a life from zoning or dying. It was so intense, each of us
pushing our abilities to our limits, but when we were finished there
were three dead smoldering gnolls, both of us had little health and 
no mana. Trust me, what she did was much more that heal-med-med-heal.

Is it efficient, I don't really care. Is it a way to get to 60th level
fast, I also don't care. I already know that if I sat and grunted I
could make any of my characters 60th level. 

I enjoy testing my abilities, and that means that sometimes I flee for
the zone and somethimes I die, but I enjoy the challenge.
