When I said "better hardware" I was referring more to what you get
with it than the overall complexity of the system. Specwise the PS2
may have better technology, but the XBox is a more complete package
(not taking games library into account)..

XBox
1. Harddrive built-in
2. LAN built in
3. 4-Ports for controllers
4. Better Graphics
