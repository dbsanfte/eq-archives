I live in a country where I can still drink stream water.

But not every stream. Some are polluted, some are full of mud and
particles, stagnant pools are a big no no, it might be downstream from
a rotting animal, lake and sea water is out...

Only pollution is a modern phenomenon, and the point of foraging is
not only to find the good water, but to make a pod of leaves or
whatever and carry it around. In EQ, that takes foraging skill, and
you won't necessarily find things where you expect to. 

Bunnies in the middle of lake Rathe *is* a stretch, though :)
