I wasn't planning to respond to any more of your posts because I think 
you're just being childishly stubborn now, but there's one more comment to 
make in light of this message. One of the dynamics that's in play here is 
that the EQ2 world is very different from the EQ world you're familiar with. 
The servers are still young and guilds are still in their most embyronic 
stages just getting off the ground. Your "unsurpassable screening process" 
may be relevant in EQ, but it doesn't exist in this context and that 
difference is one of the reasons you're having trouble connecting with my 
reality.
