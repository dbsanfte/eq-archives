As I go back and look... nope. Didn't miss it. You gave your level and
your server, but not your class or your gear.

You really aren't much better at posting to usenet than you are at EQ,
actually. Maybe I was wrong to just label you as a newbie who could be
given a nudge in the right direction. I start to believe you truly do
suck.

I find your attitude peculiar. You seem to have severe self esteem
issues.
