That they do.

Have you got any stats to back that up or is that just specultion? EQ is 
pretty beefy in terms of memory requirements due to the large number of 
models and textures, but processor wise its not that demanding, and it 
doesn't really do that much with the graphics card either really.

Lol... compared to some of the tradgedies from DELL I'd take a homebuilt 
any day :). Just last week I replaced a fried video card in a DELL 
('business class PC' [read extra expensive] where the GeForce2 MX it was 
bundled with didn't even rate a heat sink... small wonder it fried.

Rounded cables in all the benchmarks I've seen rounded cables have made 
little difference in the actual case temperature (<2-3 degrees) unless 
they were literally laid accross heatsinks or over fans.

Definately worth doing.

Pick up the mersenne prime stress test too. Biggest CPU stressor I've 
encountered so far. If anything can overheat your cpu that will.
