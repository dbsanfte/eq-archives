 You can ask him. He'll just say something like 'Fine. I will return
your headband if you return what I gave you.' It's not needed anymore.

 Invis works fine. I didn't wander too far in the library so I don't
know about all the other NPCs, but the guy you talk to isn't KoS. If you
can bring a wiz/dru with you it makes it easy to get in and out.
