In equivalent gear, fighting challenging content, rangers are worse thanks
than warriors (in terms of mana for healing).

In better gear than the warrior, fighting challenging content, sometimes
rangers are able to tank more efficiently - but this is true of any class.
I spent 3 hours in WoS with the cleric as main tank and main healer, chain
killing faster than I have done before or since.

In equivalent gear on trivial content, any class can tank.

Comparisons are only useful when taking into account a similar level of
gear, progression, levels and AA.

I've been in a lot of high groups where my warrior loses aggro to no one
and tanks better than any other character in the group.

My level 70 raid geared wizard tanked for a group in BoT when the MT was
afk, for about 30 minutes, it was more efficient than letting the 62nd
level SK tank.
