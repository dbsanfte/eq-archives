My first character was a Half Elf Ranger, which I created at the same 
time my girlfriend created her first character - a Half Elf Paladin. I 
knew nothing about EQ when I started playing so I created a particularly 
intelligent but not very wise Ranger. Needless to say he is now a Bazaar 
mule.

A RL work friend showed up and gave me 25p. I thought this was an 
absolute fortune! I remember wondering "How could anyone possibly have 
so much money as to afford giving this much away!?". He also gave me 
some sort of 1HS weapon, which I unfortunately lost during my wayward 
adventures in Lesser Faydark.

I remember running around Greater Faydark not knowing where I was, but 
absorbing the spooky atmosphere of being lost in the woods. I came upon 
a small opening in a green wall, so being the curious Half Elf I was, I 
decided to take a peek inside. Upon arriving in Lesser Faydark, I 
followed a path until I came across a friendly looking brownie. It 
wasn't long after I hailed what turned out to be a not so friendly 
brownie that I was back at my bind point without my precious 1HS weapon 
(I still don't know what that weapon was!). I was about level 6 at the 
time and this was before you respawned with all your stuff. There was no 
way I was going to try find my way back to Lesser Faydark and contest 
that brownie again to get my weapon back, so I used the money I was 
given to buy a shield and a fine steel short sword from a merchant. I 
was very proud of my Fine Steel Shortsword, and hoped to save up enough 
money some day to get a Fine Steel *Longsword*!

This was the first of the big "adventure" experiences I had. Another was 
when I finally discovered what this "Crushbone" place was and boldly 
venturing forth into the dark ominous cave which led to it. Also, making 
the big journey over to Butcherblock Mountains and discovering the 
Dwarven city of Kaladim.

I remember learning how my girlfriend's Paladin's undead fear spell and 
my Ranger's snare spell could be put to good use together to fear kite 
the undead pawns on the chess board in Butcherblock.

I remember spending hours on end having a wonderful time grouping in 
Crushbone, the excitement of looting a Shiny Brass Shield (wow it 
glows!) and the sense of achievement from completing the Screaming Mace 
quest (then the disappointment when I discovered I couldn't use it due 
to neglecting my 1HB skill).

I remember cashing in on players who bought CB belts at 1pp each, while 
I was pondering how on Norrath they could possibly afford to pay that 
much. I then used this fortune to buy a crystal fiber and a suit of 
banded armour from a player blacksmith, which I was very proud of. 
Another player even called me a twink.

I remember my first boat ride to Freeport, a city which seemed so far 
away on the other end of the world to where I was. Later, with the 
navigational advice from my girlfriend, I ran all the way from Freeport 
to Halas (merrily following the path in Kithicor Forest not knowing 
anything about the evil undead which menace the forest at night) and 
made it without incident.

I gave up on EQ for a while, then came back later to start a Mage which 
is now my main.

These first memories of EQ seem so long ago, although its only about 9 
months ago in reality, but they are quite nostalgic in a way. I almost 
feel like I really *was* a young kid growing up.

Nowadays 25pp is nothing more than spare change. I trash many fine steel 
longswords to merchants or even destroy them if I am encumbered enough. 
The boatride from Butcherblock to Freeport is more of an annoyance than 
an adventure, and usually avoided by the firepots. The same goes for a 
trip to Halas.
