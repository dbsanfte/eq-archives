So you basically use an auction system on most all drops, then? I know
you're not alone in this, but I have seen one common complaint from
other guilds who use a one point minimum auction system. That is,
essentially, the following scenario:

There is Very_Good_Lewt_Item_01 as a possible, perhaps even fairly
common drop from Uber_Mob_07, but it's monk only.  There are also some
damned fine All/All items that drop which the monks would also like, but
they will have to compete against (probably) all the other melee classes
to buy.

In a private conversation, the monks get together and say, "Ok, look. We
all want Very_Good_Lewt_Item_01, right? And we know it will eventually
drop for all of us. So why blow our ELP's on it and not get a chance at
saving up enough for that ALL/ALL item? Tell you what... let's random
between us right now. Highest to lowest order wins. Next time
Very_Good_Lewt_Item_01 drops, highest roller bids one ELP and nobody
bids against him, and so on until we all have one. Then we can save our
points and outbid those god damned rangers to get that All/All items!"

Or have you never run into such a situation?

Perhaps some pie, then?
