I came into EQ through Ultima Online, I think corpse runs are a much
better idea than having to find someone to raise you, or returning to
town as a ghost to find the healers hut.

The thing I miss most though about UO are the recall runes, those
little stones than you can get, that can be used to teleport to
anywhere on the world. I hate having to wait 20 minutes for a boat to
arrive, sometimes I only have an hour or 2 to spare, and if I want to
travel somewhere else, I can be out of time as soon as I arrive.
