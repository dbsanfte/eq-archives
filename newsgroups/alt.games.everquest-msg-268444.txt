Makes sense. Especially in an explicit 'officer award' loot system.

Perhaps there simply won't be enough suitably high level players who 
want to play 8-hours & raid 5+ days in the same timeframe each week to 
allow a guild to be made up of just those. You might consider accepting 
using a pool of good players with <20% attendance.

They aren't parasites. They're symbiotes. You will need them to field 
large enough forces to continue your progression, and, yes, in exchange 
you carry them a bit.

Severing them may render the guild unable to progress at all. A pool of 
40 <20% players could represent an extra 5-8 bodies per night... and 
could make the difference between guild implosion and guild progression.
