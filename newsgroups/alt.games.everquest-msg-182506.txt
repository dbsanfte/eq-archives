Being a hideous twinker I entirely agree. A friend and I were *duoing*
camp 2 in Paludal and keeping it entirely clear. When level 24s
and 25s came up and asked if they could join in, we had to politely
apologise that they were too high level for us (ahem...) but that of
course they were welcome to help themselves.

Once too many people arrived, we moved on, around an hour later. By
that time we'd both dinged 20 , having started at 15.

The simple fact that we were outrageously twinked and could happily
duo most of paludal before repop didnt *entitle* us to do so at the
expense of others.

POV is another matter. If someone has Inner Caves, its a boundaried
cavern with a tiny thin tunnel leading into it that supports one
group. People moving in on that spot would be given pretty short
shrift, its a pretty solidly acknowledged camp and one where even the zone
geometry encourages that principle.
