My understanding is that we are gathering on Antonia Bayle, assuming there's
room by the time my copy is delivered. The company I bought it through
stuffed up the order, which could be a good sign as there were a lot of
local orders for that game. I'm hoping to be able to play with people in
roughly the same time zone. Maybe this time round I won't find it hard to
attend a raid!
