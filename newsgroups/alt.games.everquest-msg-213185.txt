KEI whores (god bless 'em, it means I'm not harassed by buff beggars ALL the
time) do still have the capability to make loads of money.  Actually more
money than before...on Zeb anyway.

It's the law of supply & demand.  Back when a level 1 twink could get KEI
you'd see KEI whores on EVERY street corner.  As soon as they fixed it so
only appropriately-leveled people would be hit by the spell, the supply
greatly outnumbered the demand; making it so that many of the whores lowered
their skirts and decided to make an honest living.

Now the supply is almost non-existent.  You have to HOPE that there's a KEI
caster in POK, and I don't think there's ever any in Nexus or POT.

KEI WHORES, here's your chance to require a minimum payment for KEI.
