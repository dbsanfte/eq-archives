Not really. Not at all, in fact. Yes, you can advance all the way to
level 60 solo. However, there are many, MANY quests that offer up the
best gear that you absolutely cannot do solo unless you outlevel it by
at the very least 10 levels, and often even that isn't enough. Much
like, say, City of Heroes, you can solo the whole way, but you're
missing out on a lot if you do.
