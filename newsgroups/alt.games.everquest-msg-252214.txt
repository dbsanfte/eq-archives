What exactly issues do you have with soloing?  I have soloed all of my 
characters at all of their levels in a wide variety of zones.  
Admittedly, only one is over level 32, my 65 shaman.  I have found that I 
have no trouble at all finding a place to solo with him, never did at any 
level from 1 to 65.  My warrior, whose soloing days are numbered, has 
soloed off and on up to level 32.  My druid, will be able to solo up to 
65 if I had any desire to do so, same for my enchanter, and wizard.  My 
ranger can, although much more limited in zones, solo to 65, as can my 
cleric.  There are some classes that solo poorly, if at all, but, if you 
plan on being a soloer, don't play those classes.
