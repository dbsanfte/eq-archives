It's definitely an average - the threads on eqclerics about this all
say that 4x65 players get the standard level 65 adventure MOBs and 51
points. If you think about it, adding levels up wouldn't make any sense -
then a group of 4 65s would get the same adventure as a group of 6
level 45s (roughly), and the difference in difficulty would be insane.

(On the other hand, giving 4x65s exactly the same adventure as 6x65s
also seems unfair to me. Seems to be the way it works though).

It needs to be said that most of what I mentioned was *not*
original to me. Much of it I pulled from eqclerics. The rules for
"about two thirds of the next highest level" and "one quarter, rounded
up" I *did* come up with, but they're very much guesstimates...

The rest of you are doing a much better job than I of figuring it all
out. :-)
