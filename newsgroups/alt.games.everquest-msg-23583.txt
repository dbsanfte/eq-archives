[snip for brevity]

I've sent in a suggestion to Verant that they simply switch the Level 5 and 
Level 6 Bard songs around, so that the Healing song is Level 5 and Selo's 
is Level 6.

This way, bards would not get Selo's until they were PKable.  I can't see 
that changing the two songs around would have any other significant effect 
than solving the invulnerable training bard problem.
