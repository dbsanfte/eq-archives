It was at 51c and climbing slowly before I went to step 2.

That seemed to do the trick, thanks! I did a full Thep run and went 
Trader in the bazaar without any problems. We'll see if it hasn't hung 
by tomorrow morning. 

Still, I'm not happy about losing all that performance, so I will stock 
up on cleaning materials on Saturday and have a try at cleaning the CPU. 
If it doesn't work, I guess I can always revert to 100Hz, or buy a new 
one if I break it.

Thanks for your help, that was *very* appreciated.
