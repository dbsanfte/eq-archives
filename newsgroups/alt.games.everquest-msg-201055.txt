As a note, pets generate amazing amounts of hate/aggro but as soon as a PC
stands in range a mob will hit that PC isntead of the pet. It's hardcoded to
stop charmed-pet tanking tactics.
You can backoff without rooting and the mob will stick to the pet. In fact
the petmaster could backoff the pet and the mob will follow the pet (I've
used this several times to re-position bad PC tanks :) ).
