The runner is on a 90 min respawn, no placeholder, pops and moves
between the Grimling forest entrance and the southwest grimling mine -
take care to avoid (or kill) the invisible coterie scout which spawns

Sell the acrylia and windstones in the bazaar - the marks and stuff
are for the twilight armour quests and are almost worthless really
