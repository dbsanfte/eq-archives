As Lokari said, it seems apparent the logs weren't pulled until after
the fact. It also seems nothing was done until it became apparent to
the GM that the exploitation was taking place knowingly on the parts
of a good number of the raid party.

By the sound of it, it didn't exactly require a genius to figure out
their tactic wasn't SUPPOSED to work that way. The tactic at the very
best was questionable.
