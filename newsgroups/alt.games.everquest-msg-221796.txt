Unfortunately you never technically have any valid argument against 
someone who barges in and insists on your sharing your well-kept camp. It 
then becomes an exercise in frustration racing each other to the spawns 
or trying to outdamage each other on contested mobs.

I sometimes have to force myself to just leave. I use my /ignore list and 
try to make note of such dicks as I go. Hopefully I run into them later 
in a situation where I can strike back somehow. It's happened before, and 
it felt great.
