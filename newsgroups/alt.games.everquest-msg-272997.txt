No, you and others are twisting what I said to make strange claims.

Have you thought its possible the citing of the broken law only
happened when the feds showed up to check on something ? That until
that time the paperwork never existed ? Look up information on
Segregation sometime.

Maybe you buy into the bizzare notion that people were never jailed
without paperwork. Without justificaiion. But it has happened. You
can claim forever it never did. But it did.
