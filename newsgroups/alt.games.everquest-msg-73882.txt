5p is fantastic for bonechips.  And 10 for a stack of silks is low.
Buy a tailoring kit and make them into threads (spiderling) and
swatches (spider).  Before Wu's armor was an option, a stack of
swatches went for 20pp on MT.  After, due to supply and demand, some
were paying up to 80pp per stack and the price has pretty much settled
around 40pp.
