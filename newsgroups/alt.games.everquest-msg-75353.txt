Thanks for everyone's advice on the matter!
It's been a lot of help in the decision process.

I ended up getting the Geforce3 TI200.
3dMark scores went up ~90%.

Also it looks pretty scalable so when it's time to go from a P3 800 up
to one of the >1.5gig processors- it will increase an additional 80%
or so.

Not bad for the price I think.

Of course I loaded EQ with excited expectations and it runs much
better- but not what I expected...LOL

Oh well, maybe they can optimize the code a bit.

Either way...glad I did what I did.

Cya
