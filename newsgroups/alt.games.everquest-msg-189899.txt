IANAB (I Am Not A Bard) but my brother is.

Bards like SoW because
- it lasts longer (one less song to twist) - particularly useful when
  heading indoors
- No chance of dropped notes (not as big a deal with the later songs,
  but still a factor)
and perhaps most importantly...
- It's slower than Selo's.

Having it slower than Selo's is important because chant kiting (kiting
in general, really) requires that you stay in range of the MOBs. With
Selo's (and the higher-level running songs) you're over the horizon
before you can blink.

Somebody who actually plays a bard may want to expand on or correct this.
