Howdy all.
I have a question regarding the min level to start a quest.
I am a paladin of 22 seasons thinking of embarking on my Ghoulbane quest. I
have heard on some posts here that some quest NPC's may not talk to you
about a quest until you are of the min level. I searhed on Alhakazam and
found the guide for it and they only have recommended ranges.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
