I was TOTALLY UNAWARE until your post, looking at
http://www.eqtraders.com/jewelry/The_Art_of_Jewelcraft.htm#TrivialChart
that plat and velium had the same trivials.

Fire Opal is >250 though, and it took me 4 attempts at 160p each for a
single ring...it would suck big time if I blew about 310pX4 (1240p) for a
single ring.

Probably a good thing I didn't know...but I think I'm going to hunt down a
GOOD jewelcrafter to make me a pair. :)
