Why exactly do you feel that way?  I would say quiescence is the king of
kings in terms of putting a shaman heads above a druid in terms of heals.
Is there some other heal that druids have that i am missing?  Also the whole
canni line gives shaman the ability to keep healing when the druid runs out
of mana?  I am not saying druids are not or cannot be good healers, but I
was just wondering why you would say they are better healers then shaman.
