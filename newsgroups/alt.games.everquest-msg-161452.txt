Nothing of the sort.  He simply doesn't bother trying to play up to the
press like the democrats do, because he's well aware that they will _never_
give him a fair shake, unless they know damn well that not doing so will
give them a black eye.

Why should I care what they think on this subject?  The rest of the world,
in general, has no love for the U.S., unless it's in their interests.  Do
you really think they're going to give a solid American President a fair
shake?

Really?  A few misspeaks and stumbles is what makes an idiot in your book?
Well, you can safely ignore the rest of this post, then, sound in the
knowledge that the poster is a blithering moron.  After all, I can't speak
in public to save my life.  Odd how that doesn't keep me from operating a
nuclear reactor....  I think you use the criteria that prove the point you
want to believe.

Where is your support for the theory that he is nothing but a product of his
handlers?  That seems rather cynical.  As much as I loathe Clinton, I accept
that his speaches are probably mostly his own doing.  Clinton's "handlers"
were nothing more than his support staff, what we saw up there was as
genuine as it got (for him).  I think you're seeing more of Bush than you
think.  Odd, however, that when Bush does well, it's his handlers, when he
screws up, it's all him.

Do you have any understanding of the national security issues that were
involved?  My stars, think about the situation at the time!  The last thing
we need is some hot-shot President going around risking his life when the
country's in a crisis.  We'll leave that to Capt. Kirk, thank you very much.

Actually, I thought most of his speeches were rather intersting.  Of course,
I was seriously concerned about what was going to happen, so that may have
just been me.

He's managed to out-manuver the vastly smarter Democrats on many issues,
managed to bend the UN to his will (and not even by a show of threat, but
quickly understanding the issues at hand, and slapping the UN with their own
irrelevence).  Bush has managed to accomplish quite a bit with a presidency
that the media thinks is "illegitimate."  If you don't know what he's done,
take a look at news over the past two years.  Of course, anything that he
accomplishes, you'll attribute to his staff, so it really doesn't matter.

Do you want A-1 with that, or Heniz 57?

Then the media played you.
