From the shadows, the mysterious wrat@fnord.io.com (the wharf rat) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Since this did not happen in this thread, your objection remains
pointless, as I said before.

A stunning argument if there ever was one. You've yet to make a single
point or provide a single shred of evidence. You've also claimed to
have done things subsequent actions have proven false. Faned may have
been a dweeb but at least he understands how usenet works. You, on the
other hand, came in merely to try to prove your superiority and have
so far accomplished the precise opposite.
