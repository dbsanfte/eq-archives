Always found this strange.

In a group. Member loses his connection. The server Immediately tells the
group "A group member has gone linkdead" ... read again.. the server KNOWS
IMMEDIATELY you have gone linkdead and no longer playing.

Now switch to that player. He is cursing the LD gods again. He is no longer
in the game. The server knows this. He is at server select window and tries
to log in. He is communicating to the server that he is not in the game and
would very much like to connect please. The server intelligently replies
that you cannot connect because  you are already in the game.. have you kept
in mind that this is the same server that told your group you are not in the
game ?

Mind boggles at the stupidity of it.

The delay after LD was bought in many many moons ago to stop an exploit.
People would fight mobs and if they are going to lose they would just pull
the net connect and log back in without exp loss.

A 1018 that lasts more that 30 seconds is totally unacceptable.
