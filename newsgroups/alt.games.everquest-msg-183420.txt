    Where exactly? You might have to requote or something I've been up all
night again. What fucking day is it?

    Er anyway, I don't think its right, exactly for clerics to have to buff
tanks at their own expense. 90% of the time I wont even ask for a symbol,
and if i do ask for one I offer to donate every time, and I think that's the
right thing to do morally. But most of the time I either get a symbol thrown
on me and the cleric turns a donation down if we're grouping or turns it
down even if I ask and offer then. But I really don't know how many of these
clerics are actually twinks. Was grouped with one the other night who had
*4* pieces of armour that cast various clicky heals and in his words "a
ridiculously large mana pool" or something like that. He was low 40's (I was
training my defensive skills up by duoing with him and tanking light blues
in yep, you guess it, dreadlands hehe)
