The music during loading is what I think really needs ti be fixed. I have my
in game sound/music settings placed so that it's perfect when my volume is
up 4 notches (my preferred Windows usage volume level is 3 notches, those
message box dings can be really loud). The music is deafening, and I can't
adjust the volume because Compaq decided it would be neat to control the
speakers via the keyboard with a sentry program. If I try to change the
volume between server selection and character selection or between character
selection and game insertion, EQ freezes. Once I'm in the game I can adjust
the volume, tho.

/em mourns the loss of a beer, and won't speak ill of the dead.
