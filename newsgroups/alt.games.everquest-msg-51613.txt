Wizards can solo from 1 to 60. Personally I've solo'd a wizard to 37,
and I know plenty of people who have solo'd to the low 50's, as well
as a few who went solo to 60.

If the wizard is your main then you will need to camp jboots at around
level 34 if you can.

The only thing I didn't like about solo'ing a wizard was the lack of
mana regeneration (apart from harvest which isnt all that much)
compared to my necro (who i solo'd to 54).
