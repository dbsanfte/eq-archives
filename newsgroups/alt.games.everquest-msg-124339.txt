I share a server room/office with another guy where we do web content
development and testing. One of the developers wandered in a couple
weeks ago looking for my partner, (who was in the bathroom). I barely
looked up from my screen and said, "He's AFK".

The guy said, "What?"

I said, "Uh... he'll be right back. He's away."

They all look at me funny already anyway, so I didn't feel too badly.
