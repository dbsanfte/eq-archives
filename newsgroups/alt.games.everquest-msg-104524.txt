Actually, I display Luclin quite well with 3 different sucky
video cards (Intel 810 on-board chipset, Intel 815 on-board
chipset, and 4MB ATI card).  The performance is less than
perfect, but it's definitely adequate.  32MB on the video
card is probably better, but it seems to be way above "minimum".

On the other hand, 256MB RAM is indeed a bare minimum, I'd
recommend at *least* 384MB, and 512MB should be used if it's
at all an option.
