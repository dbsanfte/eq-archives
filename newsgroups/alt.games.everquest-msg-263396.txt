Sony touts that an Artisan is an archtype.  Well, you decide.

1. While on the boat to the Isle of Refuge, you are never asked to craft an 
item.  You are handed a weapon and asked to kill  goblin and some rats.  you 
are not asked to craft a rope, to tie up a yard arm or fix the sail.

2. You get off the boat the NPC what archtype you are.  You are presented 
with four choices.  The choices are scout, mage, healer, or fighter. 
Artisan does not make the list.

3. You can do a small quest on the island to learn tradeskills, but you must 
fight mobs to get off the island.

4. You get to the city after you have left the island and you cannot become 
a citizen unless you get to level six and complete your citizen quest.  You 
must hunt and kill.  you are not asked to craft an item for the city. (If 
you do not do this, you cannot level beyond 9 because it requires access to 
the city)

5. If you do a "/who all", you can only display your adventuring archtype. 
(Which they made you choose)  Which effectively means that a level 50 
Artisan will never be able to proudly display their level.  Or be asked to 
craft items for other players.

So you decide.  Is artisan an archtype?  I don't think so.  But hey, don't 
just take my opinion, got to the Beta boards, you'll see that there are many 
players who agree with me.
