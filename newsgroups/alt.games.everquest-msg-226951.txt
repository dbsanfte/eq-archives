Way back, before PoP, I had a few guild-led experiences like that in Dalnir
and in Temple of Frozen Shadow. Was probably the most fun I'd had in EQ
before LDoN came out, actually. But once the guild graduated to planes
raiding they fixated on that, which leaves me cold (and actually I've
recently dropped out of the guild, without rancor or regret). Before LDoN I
had tried myself to get pickup exp groups together to crawl a dungeon but it
was a lot of effort and rarely worked out decently.

The developers could put a great new charge into the game without having to
create another set of new zones and so forth: just retrofit the basic LDoN
concept onto a bunch of Old World dungeons. Would be excellent! Wouldn't
have to be just dungeons either -- like how about a timed mission that
involved fighting your way through the Sarnak fort in LOIO and killing the
boss mob? Or all the way through the mansion in Unrest? etc. Limited to
appropriate level ranges of course.
