>>> Off topic, but did you know there are npc soulbinders in all starting
cities (plus a few others). <<<

I know that.

Did you know that the soulbinder in Freeport is in East Freeport?

Did you know most people like to be bound in North Freeport near the bank?
Or in West Freeport by the gate?

Soulbinders are a good idea, but they are not always convenient.
