PoK lockups here also.  In addition, occasional screen freezes in
other zones from 15 to 60 seconds.  I believe these started after the
April 21st patch.  With the screen freezes that do recover there is a
lot of hard drive activity during this time.  Hard drive activity is
not as apparent when it doesn't recover in PoK.  Also had one blue
screen in congested area near the nexus stone prior to an mgb cast.

I have:
P4 1.5 GHz
NVidia GeForce4 4400
Creative SB Audigy
WinXP Pro (seems to be common denominator at least with those who
mention the OS)

I created and logged onto a different user account in XP and things
seemed to be ok for a while.  Eventually I went and used MS Office
which did some initialization under the new account.  After doing this
the problem reappeared, but most likely unrelated and just a
coincidence.
