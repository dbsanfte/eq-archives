I am still having real problems with the new UI, after I get past the
character select I keep getting booted to desktop, only got in 3 times so
far from numerous attempts.

I seem to crash as often as not on zoning too.

I can't get skins to load or do much with new UI when I can get in, even
simply clicking on spells kicked me out one time.

I seem to be able to get in on the old UI fine

I am using a GeForce 3 with the latest WHQL drivers and the latest
motherboard drivers on Windows ME.

Any ideas how I can get this to work please ?
