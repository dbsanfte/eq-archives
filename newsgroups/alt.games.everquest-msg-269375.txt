Hey, I use /whot all the time.  Whenever I join a party, I make a point to 
/whot everyone in the party so I can find out what class they are and what 
healing they'll need.  Also, when I sit in front of the bank in PoK and give 
out free buffs (refusing donations), I do a quick /whot to see what level 
buff to give them - Temp or Virt (or the permutations in between).

Plus it's just convenient, a quick way to get information about someone. 
Especially since I have /shownames 1, which hides guild affiliation, too.

Given how often I do this, I have hotkey 0 on most of my hotkey banks set to 
/whot.  Easier to hit one key then to go to the command line and type five 
keys.
