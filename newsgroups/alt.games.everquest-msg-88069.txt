Extremely subtle I'd say >)

Well atleast I've given some useful (ish!) links. hehe

Reminds me of being on tech chat yesterday for 2 hours wating for some
answers. (yes my time has also come)

It is truly amazing at how many people are on there that ask the tech chat
completely useless stuff. I mean, they get there and say " Im crashing to
desktop help me" ...so techie looks at the persons drives and waddayaknow,
they havent got the latest recommended one installed.

Whats even funnier is that scrolling along the top of the screen is what to
do if you have the Gforce crashing problem! And worse still, if it could
possibly get any worse, is the techi spamming from time to time about this
issue!! FFS!!!

ahh, kids...

Oh and if you ever use the Tech chat, dont bother if Spitman is on, he's
useless. RSewell is the man!

Cheers

Kev
