See my other post where I describe why the monthly cost of EQ
isn't the only price you pay for playing EQ.

: yet you continue to play only makes you more so.

I think you're miscalculating how much things in EQ bother me.
I just think SOE could do a better job in some areas, and enjoy
talking about it here in AGE.

In fact, I almost enjoy talking about game mechanics (and how
SOE could do things better) more than playing!  (I have a funny
feeling I'm not alone in that!)
