Exactly!

One thing that has bugged me from day 1 (and it's about about 4 months of
playing), is that the skill levels are not shown as numbers in the skills
window until level 101.

Why does it matter above 101, and not below?

This is annoying.  It compels me to have a little notebook to
keep track of the numbers so that I know which skill to work on, or to lose
track and neglect to work on some that should be worked on.

If they were going to be consistent, they should have had:

Master 1st degree   101-120
Master 2nd degree,  121-140
...
Grandmaster 1st degree, 201-220,
Grandmaster 2nd degree, 221-240
Grandmaster 3rd degree, 241-249
Grandmaster 4th degree

Or, better yet, gimme the numbers!

:P
