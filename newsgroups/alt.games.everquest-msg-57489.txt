No, actually he's right.  Ask any rogue who MISSES a backstab and
still accidently pulls aggro on himself.  Like enchanter spells, Backstab
has an intrinsic taunt value that is there whether you hit or not.

Haste items/spells do effect the speed of backstab's refresh, too.
It's a 100 delay attack, no matter what the weapon, but item haste
and/or spell haste will lower that 100 (and good combos can
lower it a LOT).

No, it's not black and white.  It's mostly white, with just a shade
of black.  White being melee frequency, black being damage/
special atacks/spells/etc all lumped together.
