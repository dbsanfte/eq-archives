Not as bad as EQ, but bad enough from personal experience.

Agreed on gear dependence, it is worlds different in EQ2 than in EQ.  
Level does matter possibly even more in EQ2 than in EQ.  I know that I 
saw huge changes in what I could solo just by gaining one level.

I'd have to say I personally have seen less issues with this in EQ2 than 
in EQ, but have heard of others having much more trouble.

My personal problem with EQ2 is that they went to the extreme in making 
it easy to play compared to what EQ used to be like, EQ has also become 
much easier to play than it once was.  From everything I have heard WoW 
is not the answer to that issue that I have.

EQ2 is much more friendly to the casual player than EQ, and I understand 
that WoW is as well.
