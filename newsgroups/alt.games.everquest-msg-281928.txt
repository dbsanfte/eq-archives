I was searching for something like that too...with no success so far.
On the other hand for my both level 67 mains there are only a few 
tasks to have,some in LoY,some in Kunark.
The list would also be needed to be sorted by classes,my Ranger and
my Cleric get completly different  tasks.
All Taskmasters in Kunark give out the same tasks but as mentioned
above its class dependant,same is true for LoY.
All in all the task system looks unfinished to me,there are very few
tasks,my Ranger gets exactly one to choose from in Kunark.  :)
