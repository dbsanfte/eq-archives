A million plat? Easily done.  I've accumulated 100k without even
trying to and am a godawful twinker and tradeskill junkie. The level
65 players that I xp with, who never raid, and routinely get 10k worth
of drops on a bad day and occasionally a 75-250k item probably have
about 10 million plat banked.

Of course, one way you get 20 million plat is by not dropping 100k on
everybody who asks for it.
