Recent patch changed this once more, now the point at which you lose exp 
and start having to go find your gear is at 6th.  Also note that at the 
lowest levels, death not only doesn't force a run or cost you exp, but 
now you don't even unmemorize your spells.  Once you start experiencing 
the full death penalties at 6, you'll find you wake up from death with 
no spells memorized.  Use the Save Spell List buttons to make this less 
of a pain.
