    Double? You had close to 50% time spent not medding over the course of a
session before you got KEI?

    KEI is an incremental increase over C2+GoB/GoI (I can never remember
which of those is the mana regen one). The difference is the duration. And
the duration change was requested by raid enchanters who hated being buff
bitches for half the raid because of how quickly the old buffs went poof.

    The nerf is already in. Tranquility (C4) has a low duration, as does C5.
Our enchanters get to go back to being buffers again, something they're not
so thrilled about. And yes, when you're doing haste for a raid and re-doing
clarity for anyone that dies you don't have much mana for other, fun things
like crowd control.

    Now, amazingly the problem could REALLY be fixed by finally fixing the
"group buff" bug that allows stuff that could not land if cast at someone to
land if the person is grouped for the group version. But I imagine that
would be too damn tough for those programmers to figure out, wouldn't it?
Better nerf the duration and hose everyone! Verantthink at its finest.
