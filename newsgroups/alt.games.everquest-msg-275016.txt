Around level 20, although they're a small minority of the total quests
you can get at that level.

The relatively infrequent group-required quests mean that groups
generally form to take on a specific quest, and disband after
completing it.  You pretty much never see people looking for a group
for grouping's sake--"L30 priest lfg" won't get much response.

EQ2 is unquestionably more group-friendly.  (And solo-hostile when I
was playing it; have the recent patches delievered on their promise of
increased soloability?)

WoW does have guilds and, like any game, being in one makes finding a
group much easier.  (And the game as a whole more fun; I'm playing WoW
because that's where my friends are, which outweighs any other
considerations between it and EQ2.)
