The two dwarves by the inn in WC will 'cut down' Crafted into small crafted
(weighs a little less than normal crafted) but it can not be undone once
reduced. IMHO there is little point (no pun intented) in cutting down the
armour as all races can wear ordinary crafted armour. You get a little less
weight but makes it much harder to sell once you upgrade to something
better.
