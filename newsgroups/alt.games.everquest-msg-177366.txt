Hail, friends. I continue to hear descriptions ranging from "meal", to
"banquet" to "feast", and I'ma wonderin, what be these strange labels and
what exactly do they mean? I have searched the earthen plane, including the
mysterious majicks of EQTraders.com, and have yet to see it fully explained
tae me satisfaction. Can one of ye 'splain?

Thanks, and see you on the battlefield!
