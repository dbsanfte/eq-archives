Since many guilds have high level officers, send an innoquous /tell to a 50+
and simply ask "Can you give me the name of one of your officers (or
guildleader)?"  If they ask why, just tell them that it's something that you
need to discuss with an officer, and offer nothing more.

I've had to go that route once or twice, and it works.
