Think about this for a minute.  Let's go back to, say, the 1960's.  Imagine
trying to convict a white man for raping a black woman in the South, or a
white man for murdering a black man.  Explain how it would be justice to
make it *nearly* *impossible* to punish white men who do those things?  All
it takes is *one* juror to decide to nullify.

Lawyers don't hate jury nullification.  It is one of the basic features of
our legal system.  However, another feature of our system is checks and
balances, and the *only* thing anyone has thought of to provide a check and
balance with jury nullification is to keep it quite, so that it will only
happen in extreme cases.  The non-extreme cases are meant to be handled by
the appeals process, or by political means (e.g., clemency).
