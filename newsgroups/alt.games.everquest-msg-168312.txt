That leaves plenty of time for work or school.  That's ~64 hours a week of
EQ.  Add in 56 hours of sleep, and 40 hours of work, and there's still over
an hour a day available for other things, like eating, bathing, bathroom,
etc., and that's assuming that he's not overlapping EQ time with other
stuff.  How long has Luclin been out?  Someone with a full time connection
can rack up a lot of /played time in trader mode.
