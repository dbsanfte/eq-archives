cant say anything about the other stuff but you can go to rathe mountains
and pay someone about 5 plat for there lambent stone they are lore so you
can only have 1 at a time. so most peeps killing hg's just let them sit on
corpses when they have more than one. just and idea and yes i know my
spelling and lack of good gramar practice sucks but oh well ( fit more
continous sentences here hehe).
