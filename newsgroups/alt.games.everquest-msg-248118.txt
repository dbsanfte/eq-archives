Well yes, and no. At least up to the point (very recently) that they
stopped letting people get at this info, several sites had posted ZEM
numbers for all of the zones, and every single last PoP zone had the
same ZEM.

The thing is that Exp is highly variable based on the level of the
mob, and a ZEM of .85 with a mob that's two levels below you vs the
ZEM of .85 with a mob that's two levels above you is quite different.

I have noticed that in PoV for example, the mobs in thy CY are much
higher exp than the undead camps, but the undead were BTM in the
low-60s and the stuff in the CYs were WTM, so now at 65 they might all
be BTM, but I know that they are very different levels.

In the EPs, mobs are even higher level, and thus give much more exp.

This is important because it means that if you go hunting high-level
mobs (like the yellow and red guards in FoZ or selected other PoP mobs
in lower tiers), you will find yourself getting EP-level exp. What's
more, if you can kill a crowd of blues that are in the low-60s in the
same time that you could kill a single mob in the EPs....
