Do you mean buying skill with your monk trainers?  If so, no.  Just start
using the weapon.  It will come up on its own.  The sooner you start using
the other weapons the better, because it will be harder to get the skill up
later on (though certainly not impossible).

Having a high dexterity will help with learning weapons skills; you'll have
a higher chance of getting a skill up on each swing of the weapon.  And also
remember that you can only skill up on light blue or higher mobs.  Actually,
I'm not sure about light blues.... I don't fight them often, but when I have
I've never seen a skill up.

One thing I do when learning a new skill is fight the mob till you have a
substantial hit point lead on your opponent, then switch weapons to your 
weaker/newer skill and use it till it looks like you may lose your lead and 
switch back again.  Or you can switch between primary and secondary (unless
using 2hb).

My level 38 bard recently started learning 1hb and in
3 levels has got about 100 points of skill-ups.  Only 100 to go!
