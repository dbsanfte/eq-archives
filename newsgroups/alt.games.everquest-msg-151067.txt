Indeed.  I've had to change the way I play, and am considering re-mapping my
keys to facilitate twisting any song at will.  Of course, this will change
all my other toons as well, but it seems like I'm at a point where planning
isn't sufficient, and flexibility becomes key.  And, of course, there's the
dread instrument swapping (especially for mezzing, what a pain).

In a few more levels, I get my fear and charm songs.  I don't know how I'll
take to them, but one thing is certain... my entire game is going to change
yet again.  (BTW, do you recommend charming adds as an alternative to
mezzing them?)

I imagine alot of people surrender, and run off to play easier classes.
Myself, I love having all the options that a bard has.  A poorly played bard
is no better than a weak warrior.  A well played bard has the potential to
surpass any other class, IMHO, but you have to be willing to always be doing
something, and costantly thinking, predicting, responding, and adapting.
That's what I love about the class.
