The key here is making the minimum time per session low so that people
can log on and progress in small blocks.  CoH is decent here, WoW looks
decent in this regard.  For many classes EQ blows in this regard.

Since Task Forces are bugged right now, I can't really say.  They look
to be multi hour endeavors.

The thing that CoH does have that might be worth "borrowing" in future
games is the sidekick system.  The ability to group with friends way
above your level and fight as though you were close to their level is
pretty neat.  Note that you do not get PL'd.  If I take on 7th and 8th
level mobs while I'm at my real level of 7 I get approximately the 
same amount of xp per mob as I'd get taking on level 17 and 18 mobs 
sidekicked to 17th.
