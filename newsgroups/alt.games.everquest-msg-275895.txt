You know, biz, maybe you should take a step back and really take a look at 
what you're saying here.

Usenet can be fun, it can be informative.  It's a nice thing, but it's 
really not that big a deal.  And when reading a usenet group devoted to a 
video game you like, or a movie you like, or an author you like, becomes a 
hassle, an aggravation, to a lot of people it's simply not worth putting up 
with.  This does not make them spineless.  It doesn't make them wimpy.  They 
just don't feel that putting up with that crap is worth it.  It's not worth 
it to fish through a couple thousand messages to find one on-topic message 
about a book.  It's not worth it to have to see the abuse heaped on you, 
even once.  People have other things they can do, you know, things that 
won't result in being annoyed and aggravated all the time, and that's what 
happened to that group.  They didn't run off scared, or crying.  They simply 
decided that reading the group wasn't worth it anymore.

Again, this has nothing to do with whether someone's a newbie.  It just 
matters how high their threshold tolerance for this sort of bullshit is. 
And if it's not particularly high, that's not some sort of failure of their 
moral or masculine fortitude.  Not everyone places such a high value on 
usenet, after all.

Perhaps, and this is going to be viewed as flamebait but that is not my 
intention, an Everquest newsgroup would be a particularly poor target for 
this sort of attack because it is populated by a lot of people who don't 
have a problem sitting at their computer for hours at a time and being 
annoyed and pissed off most of the time while doing it.

Not everyone's like that though.

My point was that invaders need to outnumber regulars, which would mean that 
a.g.e. users wouldn't outnumber them 50 to 1, and as for kookiness, I've not 
seen anyone here who can compete with the paranoid schzophrenics with a 
persecution complex that did pop up in the incident I referred to, once 
NANAU was brought into the picture.  I don't see any of the regulars here 
getting pissed off enough about a thread on this group to go marching off to 
another poster's house to gun him down, but for some of those folks, I'm not 
too sure.
