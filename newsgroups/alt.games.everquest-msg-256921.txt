I've heard "quotes" like that before from other well-known figures in the 
technology industry (seems like I've actually heard the same quote 
attributed to different people), and I can't help but think they've been 
tweaked at some point. Say what you will about Bill Gates, but the fact 
remains that I've not seen him as one to put limits on his "visions" for 
the future as a general rule.

I'm more inclined to believe he (or whomever it actually may have been) 
said something more like, "No computer needs more than 640k RAM" which 
would be completely different and likely completely accurate at the time.
