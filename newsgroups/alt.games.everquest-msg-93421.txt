I should add, I don't just look for people I know online, and ask them for
buffs or whatnot.  I have close friends online, whom I know I can count on
to drop everything in the case of an emergency, and they, in turn, know I
will do the same for them.  For example, I have met you in game a few times,
but you have never received a direct request for any help from me, you have
buffed me a couple of times, which was greatly appreciated, and you rezzed a
friend of mine, after I asked in ooc for a rez, not from you specifically,
and you happened to be there.

I know what you mean about feeling like a vending machine, if I park myself
somewhere like the docks in Oasis, heck, if I'm just passing through Oasis,
I get quite a few tells asking for a "sow plz", "pl me plz", and such.  It
gets old, and I just ignore it completely for the most part.

If someone is asking the zone in general in OOC for something, if I notice
it, I will likely as not help.
