That was the idea, the Kunark leveling treadmill gets incredibly
boring, and the loot in those places is incredibly poor.

And they had great fun! The wizard in particular, I think he'll
become a real dungeon fanatic now.

Funny, I thought the biggest difference was the massive farming in
Guk vs. the emptiness of MM ;) Anyway, I'm leaning towards Guk at
the moment, as that's the dungeon I'm most familiar with, and it
does have quite a few items we can use... But Dan reminded me that
the evil eye in Guk is a chanter, so maybe we should hit MM first
to pick up some vials of vampiric blood, before we do that...

Me neither, really. Been to Kaesora once, Dalnir once, Karnor's a few
times. We WILL be going to CoM when we hit 40, that's for sure. Some
very nice weapon drops there, and lots of mobs to kill.

Well, will be some time before we see the Frenzy camp, but we'll
definitely go there once we're high enough. Remind me, the crested
spaulders, they drop in the graveyard, right? We've already had
one outing to the MM courtyard area, and have gotten a couple MM
shields.

>Crowd control I find is not something that is the business of the chanter or
>bard, it is the business of everybody.

Well, yeah, but there's nobody but a bard or a chanter who can stop
mobs dead in their tracks. Rooting just isn't as good, and tank-
parking sucks up healing mana. Currently, our idea of dealing with
adds is gathering them up and AoEing them to death, and that won't
cut it in the long run, for sure.

Well, yeah, but some dungeons become very hard to do without an actual
crowd control class. So we'll have to pick our camps more carefully.
I'll try schooling the casters in the art of root-parking on our next
trip to Cazic, if I can get them to lay off the AoE frenzy...

But saying "Yeah, we can do it" is great fun! Like when we tried to
pull the Avatar! I still can't believe we got away without a single
death from that one... And the wizard wanted to try it again, hehe...

Trust me, we're not in the least bit scared to be killed in nasty ways!
Especially since the cleric dinged 39 yesterday, so we'll regain some
exp from his rez now...

Heheh, one of the things I did to convince my friends of the joy of
dungeon crawling was hitting LGuk with a couple friends and holding
Frenzy, Sentinel, and the Ghoul Lord with my main. When they saw the
non-stop action, they were suitably impressed ;) Of course, when we
got two simultaneous LDs, we got a wipeout, but the exp was so great
anyway, that we didn't mind one bit.
