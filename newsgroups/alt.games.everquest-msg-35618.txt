I think that's a right way to play a ranger/druid. ANYONE who has
discussed Ted's thoughts on hunting knows he eats and makes use of all
his kills. I play a ranger and a druid. I kill them, and use them, and
do not disrespect the wolves and bear's lives by leaving thier bodies
on the ground to rot. I also pick up others kills to give the poor
animals a chance for a decent burial and the use of thier products.

The American Indian understood this principle. The American Hippie
(mentality) does not!

On killing Treants, there is nothing to gain by killing magical
creatures sent to assist us. We have been warned against it, and will
be judged (faction) if we kill a Treant. Similarly, we have been told
that Surefall is a magical place and will be judged if we kill there
too!
