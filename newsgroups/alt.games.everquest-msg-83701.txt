I am thinking of getting a broadband router/firewall, but I am concerned
that it may have an effect on on-line games.  Will a broadband router cause
any problems with games such as Everquest and other massively multiplayer
games or games like Quake 3 or Tribes 2.



I was wondering if anyone has had any good experiences with any specific
makes and models or has had problems with any.



Is there any good sites that compare different models.



Thanks in Advance.
