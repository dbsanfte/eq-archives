Exactly! Discovering the recipe for beer braised bear was way more fun than
killing the bear to get the meat! Making that first small bag excited me
much more than killing the poor creatures to get the materials. Here's
hoping some of your ideas make it into a future patch! For the trade lovers
in all of us!
