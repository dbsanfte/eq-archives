I, too, ran a BBS in the early 90's and went online in 1992. The only
infection ever I got came from some game my girlfriend's fool son (hacking
legend in his own mind who doesn't even know what spyware is!)downloaded
that contained the Funlove worm/virus. Within an hour, it infected my entire
LAN, CD-RW disks, ZIP disks and anything else writeable. Took a while to
purge that sucker. Since then, I have set up full access passwords on all
shares so the only one who can install software is ME!
