    When we were doing Vex Thal a while ago, a joke was posted by Furor on
the FoH boards. A guild had just been nailed for exploiting by warping a mob
down to the first blob's room, when it looked like what had happened was
they got aggro through the floor of the room above them when the blob they
were fighting Gravity Fluxed everyone up near the roof. So he pointed out
how stupid this was by posting a fictitious log of a blob fight showing
people being flung to places like Misty Thicket and Povar, and mobs like
Mooto adding into the fight. Well, as we were doing the same fight, one of
our paladins logged on a same-name character on Povar and quietly logged
into the raid channel. After the third Grav Flux, we had povar.Ebobulous say
into the channel, "OMG, I'VE BEEN FLUNG TO POVAR!" I was surprised we
managed to win with all the laughter that caused.
