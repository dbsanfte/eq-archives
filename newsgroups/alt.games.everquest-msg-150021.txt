I must agree here... announcing mend is more of a monkly decision.  On
most occasions I do not announce it.  I used to when younger, but
since Ive become the main puller (most of the time) in pickup groups,
I use mend when I need it and away from group, or some foolish cleric
decides Im a Tank and will live long enough for a Cheal.

Necros just rock.. to not use their other spells beyond Dot's is just
insane...  they can do so much.

Yeah, they should help heals between pulls (of coruse if not
chainpulling)

Joo, are crazy... get a good SK and he will never lose aggro.
now, I cant stand it when I see an sk just fighting.. they have spells
that can taunt those nasty foes..... so Id say not keeping aggro is an
issue.
