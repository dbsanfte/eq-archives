Breeze will be a spectral Globalwin Heatsink and Fan that will appear over
the recipients head, Clarity will be the same but an Alphacooler :�)

These are just keeping EQ up with the spell effects from DAoC, I thought
they might have revamped them with SoL, good to see they have gotten round
to it.
In fact I believe that these were ready before but were held back for the
Bazaar to be released. That way no moron could run thru the EC tunnel,
masturbating his rightclick effect Grim Aura and lagging everyone stupid.
Of course those idiots can still do it in the bazaar but as most people turn
everything off as soon as they enter and over half are AFK (and probably not
even at home) it won't have the same griefing effect.

At least practice casting just got a bit more fun for a while :�)
