Keep the video card in the first PCI slot (sounds like you have a PCI board
since you moved it). Put the sound card in slot 3.

Make sure you have an IRQ allocated to the video in the BIOS

Make sure you have the latest chipset drivers for your Motherboard, this is
especially true if the board uses a VIA chipset.

Sometimes, Video/Sound conflicts can be solved by enabling "15-16Mb Memory
Hole" in your BIOS.

Try changing the "PnP aware OS" flag in the BIOS.

If your MoBo has onboard sound, make sure it is disabled.

Good Luck.
