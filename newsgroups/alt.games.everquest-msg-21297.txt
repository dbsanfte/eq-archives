Hey

I started in EQ as a warrior. By the time I came to start my druid, I
was familiar enough with EQ to know what would be the best race for
stats, but I decided to play a human druid because I WANTED to.  

Partly, I just wanted to look different from all those other litle
druids running around out there. Also, I didn't fancy starting out in
Greater Faydark. I much prefer Qeynos as a starting area..... less
crowded than Gfay and Freeport area.  I know I could've had a guild
mate TP me over, but it just didn't seem right somehow.

Stat wise, I have the trading thing down to a fine art (just spent all
my plat on a Springwood Club, and was back up to 2kpp after a day in
EC), so I was able to make money quickly and get wisdom items to make
up for my racial failings (I have 176 wis at lvl 29 which seems ok).

I guess my question is this.....

Are there other people who actually chose a race based on reasons
other than stats? Surely the game is about more than math, right?
