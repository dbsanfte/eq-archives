Aha, but when the patch is over (and this was apparantly a very short term
one) players (CUSTOMERS!) log on, but since my meatpuppet is sleeping,
he doesn't log me back on.  Thats hours and hours of potential trader time
lost!

Killing it, and I'm so very glad.  I despised the whole auction process.  I
found this to be one of the least enjoyable aspects of the whole game,
in fact.  Adding the auctions channel helped a bit, but in its own way
it was just another form of hell; sure, no more sitting there in EC doing
nothing useful while trying to buy and sell... but the haggling was still
the same, with the added fun of worrying about delivery!

Further, EC is really a good hunting zone for lowbies.  But with 100
people there in peak hours, it could be impossible to utilize.  Now
Bazaar, for all its faults, has never been mistaken as a hunting area
for anyone.

Sort your trading mule out any time you like.  When you go to log out,
swap him in, already standing in place, and type /trader.  Occaisionally
load him up with new sales stuff.. but you don't need to make a point
of doing that every night.  There is no rush, and there is little need to
commit lots of time to the project on a regular basis.

Sometimes a patch or something else will knock you offline.  So when
you get up in the morning, you didn't see a whole 8 hours (or however
long) of selling while AFK... big deal.  Thus, the joke I was making with
my post.
