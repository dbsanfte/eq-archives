Get this.  On Bertoxx, the MOTD went something like this:

"Chicago Fan Faire is sneaking up on us and will be held....."

So I check to see if a GM is on.  Yep.  I say "You have a grammar 
error...."  He says "I didn't post it".

Sheesh - sounds like my kids.

I said "just thought maybe you would want to change it".

Nope.

(oh, the grammar error is Upon not Up on)
