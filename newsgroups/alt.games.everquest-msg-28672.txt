I have a compaq computer that is connecting to the Internet with a cable
modem and installed with win98se.  I can play EQ for about maybe 15 minutes
to an hour and then for no apperent reason it drops me back to my desktop
with EQ not even in the taskbar.  I have checked setting concerning my
graphics card, my sound card, and my network card, all are on indiviudal
IRQs.  I have reinstalled and repatched EQ and still the same thing happens.
The interesting thing is though that the less people that are on the server
and the less things that I do the longer I can play.  Because of this I
think its a connection problem.  I am not running any type of firewall
solution and I dont have any other program running in the background trying
to use the Internet connection while I am playing EQ.  Has anyone else had
this problem or does anyone know of any possible fixes.  I though their
might be something I can change in the datarate file but I forget the thread
that talked about how to use this file.

Thanks
~Todd
