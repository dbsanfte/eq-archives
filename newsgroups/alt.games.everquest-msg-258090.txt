You use your turn signal though, right?  And when traffic is flowing and
there is a lot of room, you target a spot to fit in and adjust your speed,
yes?

I'm not talking about when traffic is packed.  When traffic is packed, the
folks in the merge-to lane need to be considerate and attentive.

When traffic is normal and sane, expecting the flow-through traffic to
accomodate for you is just lazy driving.

I asked around a bit on what the right-of-way laws are here in california.
Where I grew up (Maine), the mergee ALWAYS has right of way.  That's how I
was taught, anyhow.  But after asking around it seems that in California,
if someone is trying to merge in front of me I have to let them in. Seems
like a messy policy to me, to be honest...if I'm going 55mph and some
fellow comes in at 30mph we're looking at some mighty unsafe situations.
But if that is the case, it certainly explains the mentality around here
that merging cars act as if there are no cars in the lanes they merge
into.
