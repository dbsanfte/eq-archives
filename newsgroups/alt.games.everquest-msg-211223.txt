Ok, I've got my shaman now to 62 and need a break form the grinding.
Decided to start an alt and would really like to play a troll just
because it's not a common choice.  Shadow Knight sounds fun for
role-playing potential, but I'm curious...

I keep reading how bad the troll exp penalty is and how it will take
forever to level him.  I'm not really letting this discourage me
because I just want to use him as a distraction form my main, but how
bad is it really?  I mean are we talking weeks to get to level 10?  Or
is it just an annoyance?

Would love to hear experiences / advice from others who have tried
this path.  TIA
