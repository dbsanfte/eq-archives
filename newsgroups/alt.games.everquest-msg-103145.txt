The facts of the case as I heard them were, yes, the coffee was brewed
hotter than industry standards: Hot enough to cause SECOND DEGREE
BURNS. That's just a TAD hotter than standards. Also, the coffee was
spilled in the lady's lap, not through her own fault, but through the
INCOMPETENCE of the employee working the drive-through window: They
didn't make sure she had ahold of the cup before letting go. The
result was the cup was dropped and came open in her lap.
