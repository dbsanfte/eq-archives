Or, if you don't feel like collecting half a million bone chips and either
don't have or don't care about FV faction:

1) Go to LOIO and find a tower full of 'explorer' mobs - mostly elves and
barbs.
2) Kill them, and save any of the 'Explorer Survival Knives' they drop. The
leader mob also drops a lore necklace with AC 6 +3WIS +3INT +3AGI All/Al and
I think it also acts as a compass.
3) Keep killing until your Legion of Cabilis faction is dubious or better.
Also kill goblins and so on for faction.
4) Go to Trooper Vaurk (also in LOIO) and turn in knives for decent boosts
with most Cabalis factions except the necros.

For the Cabilis necro faction, just kill lots and lots and lots of outcast
Iksar.
