Probably not too important at your lvl but Research is where you need to put
some training... Ensure that you keep a lot of training points for later use
in research you will need them.  The rest is just fun really and not
important for a wizard unless you want to do some of the Coldain Shawl
quests later on.

Really you are into root and nuke until you get Bonds of Force at Lvl 29
which is an area of effect snare spell.  That is when you can start to take
on multiple mobs and really get your exp moving.  Doesn't really matter what
combination you use at the moment.  Just root and nuke to get your mobs down
as low as you can and have a convenient escape route like a zone nearby in
case you need to bail out.

Your spells normally interrupt because you move .. a little tip when using
your arrows to move .. if using the down arrow to move backwards when you
stop hit the up arrow once and nine times out of ten you won't interrupt.
Frustrating I know but works o)

Enjoy the Wiz .. they can be frustrating since you will die a lot during the
early lvls but they get fantastic spells as you progress, including
Concussion a quest spell which will save your life time and again as you get
to the higher lvls.
