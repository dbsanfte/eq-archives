As a shaman, I started PoP zones at 57.  All I have to do is put on lfg,
really doesn't matter what zone I am in, I could be prepping for a fear raid
in Feerott with LFG on, and I get tells asking me to come to one of the PoP
zones.  At 58 and 59, if I am in a PoP zone, I don't even have to put lfg
on.
