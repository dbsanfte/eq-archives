Just Jekke and Carolynn's Mom are both fucked up. The Warrior quest is
completely broken, Verant doesn't give a rat's ass, and furthermore,
that quest has always worked flawlessly without a single hitch. Jekke is
a drooling, ignorant twat, and Carolyn's Mom is obviously the
misbegotten byproduct of the mating of a crackwhore and a Drolvarg
Sentry. 

Oh, and you're a big doody head.
