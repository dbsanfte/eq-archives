Hey...I dated this incredibly hot pre law student in college...her name was
Carrie Chemyleski ( I think that's how it's spelled..pronounced
sheh-mah-leh-ski). She spoke fluent french and was a complete knockout...

Think you can find her for me...considering you really have no life and
nothing else constructive to do?
