I was referring to EQ1 lol

My bard is a wood elf and is still pre-elemental though I have been playing 
this char since march 2002 lol

I am in a small family raiding guild which usually fields about 20 chars. 
Had a great guild first by killing the Protector of Dresolich in Solro tower 
on our first attempt with 20 in raid :)

so you can see what type of level we are my magelo number is 344650 :P I 
think you will agree that with everyone being a similar level of equipment 
we did very well especially as our tank for the PoD was a 66 warr with less 
than 100 aa :)
