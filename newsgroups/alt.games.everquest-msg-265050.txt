www.gamasutra.com, click "postmortem".  That gets you a series of articles
written by people various game companies looking back at their games,
telling what went right, what went wrong, and giving interesting information
like staffing, tools used, how many lines of code were produced, how long it
took, and, for some, the budget.

You need to register to read these, but it is worth it.

There's one for DAoC on that page.  There's also one for Asheron's Call (the
original...do not confuse it with the one for the tools for AC2), which is
NOT on the page for some reason, but can be found by using the site's
search.

Besides those two MMORPGs, there are postmortems for a huge number of PC and
console games.
