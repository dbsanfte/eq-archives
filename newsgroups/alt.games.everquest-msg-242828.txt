Fish up some crab, whip up some of the beer battered stat food and
sell in bazaar for mucho plat.  The stat food you can make from GoD is
great, the rest of the combines are all aboard the ship in Abysmal
Sea.  If your baking isn't so good, you can cheaply get it up with
Batwing Crunchies and Fish Rolls.

Fish in Plane of Nightmares or Plane of Valor and sell the fish or
bones for the Fisherman's Companion quest in the bazaar.  Excellent
quest for fishermen (and drunkards).

Also, once you get your fishing skill high enough, make Blessed
Fishing Rods and sell in the bazaar.
