I am not defending him for missing maps, I was pointing out that your
characterization of his missing many Kunark maps was incorrect.  I was also
pointing out that the maps he does have are superior to any other maps I
have seen for the zones in question.  Any time he has added a new map, I
immediately replace whatever previous map (which by and large have come from
eqmaps) I used with his.

Regardless of which maps he does or does not have, the ones he does have,
are, by and large, superior to the maps at eqmaps.  That is, of course, just
my personal opinion.  I will always go there first to see if there is a map,
if there is not one, then my second choice is eqmaps.  In general, the maps
on eqmaps for any of the zones which are not mapped on eqatlas, are fairly
poor maps, when compared to the quality of the maps at eqatlas.  If, and
when, he does create maps for the zones he has not mapped yet, I fully
expect them to be of equal quality to his other maps, and thus, far superior
to those I have found at eqmaps.
