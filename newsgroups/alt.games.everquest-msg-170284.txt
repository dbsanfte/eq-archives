It is tough to get any particular beast to spawn in shadeweaver.  You 
need people laying waste to the entire area on the easy side of the 
mountains. I'd say 20 people in the zone killing constantly is the only 
way to get some of the rares to spawn.  Don't even try to get the ghulam 
breastplate, those bugs are ultra rare and the 2 whole times I've seen 
them, they didn't drop a thing.
