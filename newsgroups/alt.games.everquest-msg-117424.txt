  Levitate is fine in some circumstances, like when traveling over long
distances over water or hilly terrain.  It can be moderately helpful if
you're fighting somewhere with uneven terrain, though usually I'd rather
thake a 10-40 point drop than have to spend 10 seconds figuring out how to
position myself so I don't get "You can't see your target" or "Target out of
range" messages.  Of course, this is all from the perspective of a melee
class... if I were a caster, I guess the only consequence of levitate in
most circumstances would be that I get to look like some sort of Indian
mystic by levitating while seated, which is cool.

  And of course DMF is great where you need high poison resist, or need to
breathe underwater or in a vacuum.
