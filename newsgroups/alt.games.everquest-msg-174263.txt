I used to pay 2 pp for a sow. Then when i got sow, and sowed others upon
request, i was surprised to find that they felt no obligation to donate
anything, and were outraged at the suggestion. I'm level 52 now, and 2 pp
doesn't mean a lot, but it's kind of like having someone walking up to you
and asking for a dollar... get enough of that and you start shooting at
people. So now i speak old dragon at them until they get bored and latch on
to some other potential target.

http://www.teamxspeed.com/wtf/strip1.jpg sums my attitude towards beggars
nicely.


That said, i often buff people who don't ask for buffs, especially if I'm
coasting through a newbie zone and they are having a hard time of it. Or i
might wander through the bazaar giving people charisma buffs before putting
my mule back to work... i like to do it by ambush, and disappear before i
can be spotted. At least level 60's don't beg, and i even got a kei that
way.
