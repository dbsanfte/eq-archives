It's probably a NODROP item.  The merchant will tell how much they will pay
for the item, but when you go to sell it the SELL button is greyed out.
Sometimes you will get a message saying "I will pay you absolutely nothing
for a Young Puma Pelt" even after they offered to pay X amount for it.
Bottom line is, you can't sell it.  This means is a quest item of some sort.
Do a little research and if it's worth it, do the quest, if not, destroy the
item.
