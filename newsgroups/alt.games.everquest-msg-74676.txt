That's the reverb going crazy, and I have been having the same
problem... I have just installed the latest SB drivers, so we'll see if
they fix the problem.

In the meantime, just type /reverb whenenver the screeching starts. The
problem is, for some reason the reverb OFF flag gets reset every time
you zone, which is a real pain.
