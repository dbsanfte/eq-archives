The dirty little secret of the high end guilds.  You really only need about
a group's worth of people that *know* what they're doing, and just need the
rest of the people to be able to follow some simple instructions.

If the core group of each guild on a server joined up together, they'd be
unstoppable.  They'd also be such a clash of arrogance that they'd probably
self-destruct before they got to the first target.  :)
