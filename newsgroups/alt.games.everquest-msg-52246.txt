IMO he has to share, he cannot have all three. The problem is unless he
actually said that he'd give up two and keep the one he really wants you'd
likely be in for a lot of shit over it (fortunately the GM's will see it
your way so as soon as he starts telling you what you can or can't have
petition)
"Gentlemanly" rules require that both parties show some consideration, this
isn't always the case.
