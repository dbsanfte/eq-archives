As a whole, the Neutral Team on Sullon Zek has chosen to be a worse enemy
toward Good than Evil currently is.  The Neutral Team is not 'neutral.'

There are a few guilds and individuals among the Neuts who roleplay a
balance of power, or who seek an alliance with Good to counterbalance the
overwhelming numbers of Evils.  Some roleplay Neutrality with the approach
that, 'all extremists, Good or Evil, are a threat and must die!'

However.....many on the Neutral Team simply tried to crush the Good Team out
of existence, because they saw what they thought was an easy target.  They
failed to destroy the Goods, and now, instead of potential allies, they have
a very angry neighbor at their back.

Strategically, in a long-term war, Team Neutral's actions have doomed them
to a multi-front war.  They're already cut in half, since the Evil Team
holds Freeport, and now they literally have enemies on ALL sides of them.
In a long war of attrition, that is a recipe for disaster and defeat.

In the meantime, both the Good and Evil teams grow stronger, as the slow
constriction on Neutral territory begins......
