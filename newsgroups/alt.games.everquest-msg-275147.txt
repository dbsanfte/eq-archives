So why should a group of 20s be able to take on something five levels
higher than them?  Does that mean that a full group of 40s should be
able to take on a group 50 mob (keeping the same percentages you use).
If you mean absolute levels, does that mean a full group of 5s should
be able to take on a group 10 mob?

It isn't as simple as that, for some fairly obvious reasons.
