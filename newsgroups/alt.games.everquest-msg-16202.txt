You'll find this is how solo'ing a wizard mostly goes... most every
blue fight is going to cost you at the very least three bubbles of
mana.  At lower levels, it's a pain to solo a wizard, I'd suggest
doing it as little as possible.

It's been a long while, but are you sure these are all of your newest
spell ranks?  You should try to cast you newest spells, the
mana/damage ratio increases with each spell rank.  If you're using
lower leveled nukes to fight stuff, you'd loose a lot of mana.

That seems a bit low for a high elf, yeah.  But I wouldn't bother
resatarting, a higher intelligence doesn't give you more mana, it just
increases your maximum mana total.  And once you get your intelligence
to 200, it doesn't matter anyway.  And it's pretty easy to hit this
mark, my human wizard started off with 115 intel, I think, and managed
to hit 200 without even having to use Efreeti Boots, Impskin Gloves,
or a Runed cowl.  of course, I doubt I could have done this without
the sol-ro exclusive imbued rings...

In the meantime, be on the lookout for cheap +mana jewlery.  Moonstone
Rings are a great deal, a Skull of J'enthra is easy to get, and fits
in you off hand, and polished bone bracers are pretty cheap to find.
That's about 100 mana just on items alone, items that probably won't
cost more than 300 plat or so to buy.  Plus, you can allways quest for
your Staff of the Wheel, a mainhand 1hb weapon that adds +10 intel,
+10 mana, +10 hit points.  It's not an easy quest, but you dont' have
to kill anything to complete it, and provided you can get a guide for
Lower Guk, it's mostly safe.  However, being a high elf, I wouldn't
try to do this quest until your level 16 and have Invis.

Well, if you feel you really have to do this (and honestly, you don't,
stats simply are not that big a deal), the best way is to find a
trusted friend to stand near your new home town, delete the character,
restart with the same name, pick up your items from him, and bank them
until you're level 6.
