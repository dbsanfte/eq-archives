   As I've said before in thread, poison is all about the dose.  People
have even managed to poison themselves with water (they had to work pretty
hard at it, but still, it has been done).  I don't think that the visine
would kill anyone in the doses I would be using.  But... what if they
happen to be particularly susceptible for some odd reason?  I dunno.  To
me, it sounds like the visine would just be a waste of time, with a bit of
possibility for an unacceptable outcome thrown in for fun.  

   I think there are better ways to deal with this.
