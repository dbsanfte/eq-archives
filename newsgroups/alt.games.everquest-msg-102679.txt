AT-ndrew, if non-native English speakers know "plz" then they also know
"please" and can type that just as easily as native English spellers.

Foreign folks aren't freaks, they have 10 fingers just like us, and are at
least as smart as us.  Don't imply that they're too stupid to type or spell
correctly.

Change of subject.  I'm not sure whether or not you were saying that
Americans spell "generalize" wrong, but if you were...you're mistaken.
