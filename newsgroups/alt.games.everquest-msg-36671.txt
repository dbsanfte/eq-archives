Considering everquest.  Coming down from D2...

1. What is the current state of everquest? Is it buggy? Has it degenerated
into a flaming hate filled mosh pit or is it in a state of high refinement?
(Or somewhere in between). Opinions ARE sought...

2. How to get started? Buy which package of software? Is there a package
that brings you up to date with the current goodies or do I have to buy
Everquest 1.0 and additional software?

3. Will I spend the first several hours/days downloading patches?

I've heard how addictive it is, and how you realize after a while that it's
evercrack and just a game to level level level...and that you spend time
fighting, healing forever, or dying and stuggling to recover body. Also I've
heard about the camping for treasure and that can be no fun. But I've also
heard that the fun you have before boredom/disillusionment is worth the
price.


Or, on the other hand, is ANarchy Online fixed yet? That one really sounds
good!

Sorry for all the newbie questions....I'm not a newbie in everythning i do,
but here, in this forum, I am one.
