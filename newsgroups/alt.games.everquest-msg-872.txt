Yeah, like the Einstein who I grouped with (just the two of us and one
other) who after me telling him NO (I was higher LV and so was the other
guy) he decides to steal a orc camp from a group a few levels higher than
us.  They didn't mind him KSing them.  Was a good distraction for the next
few seconds.
WORD OF ADVICE!!!
When you see a FULL group of characters about 5 levels above you and they
aren't doing too well on a camp, it is a VERY BAD idea to try to SOLO KS
them and pull their entire camp on yourself.
Although I could have attempted harmony on them or healed him, I and the
other (cleric) decided we'd rather practice our "running to zone" skill.
His death wasn't in vein though.  He led a few orcs away from the camp
(breaking it) and the group got the others, so he did break the camp for
them though.  There is just better ways of helping others.  Like I would
take my Ogre Warrior and go to camps of players many levels below me (to
where I'd get some EXP if I had fought, but it wouldn't be worth it) and
acted as their puller with my bow.  Other times I'd see a group of 6 and
even though I wasn't able to get in the group (they were full) and the mobs
were too dangerous for me to fight alone, but I'd sit and take a few wacks
at them anyway.  I would do some damage to them, and even though I'd not get
EXP (since there was no way I'd out kill a group of 6) I'd be fighting mobs
of my LV without them taking damage on me, raising my skills, and helping
the group with a few HP damage each.
