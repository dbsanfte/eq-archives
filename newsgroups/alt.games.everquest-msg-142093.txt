Makes sense. If you're a caster who is most often in a group then your defense 
skills wouldn't increase so quickly, thereby making you less able to defend 
yourself when you are being beat upon.

It's also good that you added "in a good group", cuz I've been in many groups 
which didn't make leveling any faster at all. At some times, however, you get in 
just the right group and everyone is getting exp like crazy.
