I read somewhere that giving a weapon to  pet does not increase the damage
done, just increases the chance of doing max damage. Not sure thats true,
because my pets seem to do more damage when armed. Although my level 13 SK
with his level 4 walking dog food (level 4 skellie is crap at level 13)
can't hit wisps at all, suggesting they can't hit magical mobs 'til later.

"Well, then whose fault was it, the torpedo's?"
