That's totally unrelated.  Take the two as a given:  only
four pets at a time on a mob and a successful PoA raid with
20 mages.  The logical assumption is that PoA mobs can be
tanked successfully by mage pets, four at a time, because
when one pet dies it is immediately replaced by another pet
and there is effectively no limit on the number of pets that
can be sent to attack one mob just a limit on the number that
actually can be attacking it at once.

Surely with only four mages "tanking" one mob, the other
three pets won't die before the one with the dead pet can
recast.  With only the summon pet, damage shield and Burnout
lines active, mages wouldn't get aggro and they could med the
entire fight when not summoning a pet or buffing it.  There
wouldn't even be a need to heal the pets.

So you end up with (assuming 20 mages) either four or five
effective groups, fully functional except for crowd control.
And with four or five groups, you really don't NEED crowd
control; each group attacks a different mob.  Add in one
enchanter to C2 the mages, a cleric to rez the unlucky mage(s)
who gain aggro and die, a necro to summon corpses for travel
between islands and a monk (or SK) for pulling and you've
got a fully functional raid.  And, of course, all the mages
get to send their pets to attack each island's boss mob to
overload the damage output they put out.  And, again, that's
largely a function of "okay, send the pet, wait for the NUKE
call, and all 30 mages unload..."  That's a LOT of damage
output.

That raid implies nothing about the "four pet per mob" rule.
All it means is that a sufficient number of pets can tank
many non-AoE mobs successfully.  And most people already knew
that.
