Have to agree. Same lore, same world, aye, but no more similar
mechanics-wise than EQ1 and CoH.

An amusing anecdote...I've been annoyed lately that they STILL have
wolf-form and bear-form spells for druids and shaman.  Ms. Cleric over
here grousing that they get cool self-forms with stat boosts and I don't
seem to get anything at that level, and didn't SOE that these weren't
supposed to be the same classes as EQ1, so why the wolf and bear forms?

Then it occured to me...that the existence of these magical abilities
isn't so much a mechanics/class thing as it is a part of the LORE of the
world.  So, yes, it has every right to stick around.

Then again, so was complete heal...but...um...that's a little less
tangible a change in the "lore".  (And I don't miss THAt one, trust me.)

So I guess I'll have to quit my internal bellyaching.  (as opposed to the
external belly aches..)
