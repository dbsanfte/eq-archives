<sigh>  This grows old.  It is a variant ... the original is the acronym
'Person witrh Little Or No Knowledge'.

http://www.acronymsearch.com/index.php?acronym=plonk

Which also can be found as 'Please Leave Our Newsgroup, Kid'.

http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~oheiabbd/veraresp-e.cgi?Search+option=acronym&
Search+width=exact&Request=plonk

btw, you should never quote directly in a ng article when the source can be
found online.  You reference the url.

I'm through with this discussion.  You'll never change your beliefs, nor
will I.  Further discussion of the point is irrelevant and a waste of
bandwidth.
