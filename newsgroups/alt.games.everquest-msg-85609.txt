Not me...gotta get the attitude...you're an enchanter, you're a god.  Don't
explain nuthin, just give 'em what you want to give 'em and let 'em live
with your decision. <g>  The only one you have to be nice to is that cleric.
<g>  If a tank insists on a buff that I don't think they need, I'll oblige,
but it takes a minute or two...gotta sit down, decide what spell to
temporarily dump, find the page with this buff, mem it up, cast it on them,
forget the spell, put up the right one, then stand back up.

I had the same attitude before Luclin when dumbass_shaman03 (just picking
out a class at random, I love shaman) with 195 WIS wants me to cast Insight
on them so they get the whopping 40 more mana.

Nah, not me...I see it as an opportunity for 24 (now 36) seconds to med.  If
you're going to AE mez, though, it's generally a good idea to hit yourself
with a magic resist buff first. :)

I totally missed this part the first time.  When you get higher in levels
the clerics get paid back for reagents.  No one even thinks about making
sure the enchanter gets their costs covered.  That's one of the primary
reasons I rarely cast it.
