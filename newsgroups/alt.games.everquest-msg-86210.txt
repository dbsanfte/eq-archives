Ok I just started playing PvP on Vallon Zek. I have a Troll SK worships the
Prince of Hate (Innoruuk). I am using Neriak as a Binding point. I am still
too young to risk running to Grobb for training, and the DE SK trainers will
not talk to me (Dubious). How can I raise Faction with the Dark Elves Necro,
SK guild (The Dead). I have tried the fire beetle eyes quest but again the
Quest Giver will not give me the Quest (Dubious). Any help will be greatly
appreciated.
