Yeah, and wade through not only druids, but nercos chewing up a mob
every minute and wizards quadding faster than a druid could.

What the hell does KillStealing have to do with quadding.  No druid is
going to be able to out damage ANY class using our quad nuke spells.
They're nice, but don't have a real high DPS, particularly when you're
trying to keep out of reach so you don't have FOUR mobs going Ike
Turner on you.

No, but it is your fault when you behave like a slack jawed mewling
idiot.
