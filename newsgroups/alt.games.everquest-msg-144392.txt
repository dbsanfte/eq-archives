Not having played an SK, I'd have to vote for that cheesy little
disease-based dot that they can chain cast for agro the way my
Paladin uses multiple stuns.  SK's are the only characters I've
ever had trouble taking agro from given similar level and gear
quality, and you can't tank if you can't hold agro.

Kaev <--- who suspects that Rangers could compete for agro too,
but for some odd reason they don't often try...
