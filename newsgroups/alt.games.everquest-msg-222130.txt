I'm curious as to how extended range helps you be main tank... a
job that requires being in melee range of the target.  My guess
is that you use it to cast an aggro producing spell at a distance
so as to gain aggro faster on incoming, or perhaps even pull with
it.  But it -sounds- contradictory on the surface.

ps My Improved Heal item is helpful only if I'm main tank... so
contradictory sounding statements are not alien to me
