Everyone already knows what the problems are with the game, I think he was
taking a lighthearted approach to venting his frustration over the game
bugs. His last sentance sums it all up quite nicely. It made me smile

mildly entertaining article on his game experiences makes you a "drooling
fuckwit" in other peoples eyes.
Take a chill pill.
