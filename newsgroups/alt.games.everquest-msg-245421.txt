The easiest way is to do it at the options screen when the patcher has
run.  You could also edit your eqclient.ini file.  Here is the start of
mine:

[Defaults]
Sound=TRUE
FEWindowedModeXOffset=256
FEWindowedModeYOffset=192
WindowedMode=TRUE
ReadOnce=TRUE
UseLuclinHumanMale=TRUE
UseLuclinHumanFemale=TRUE

Change the sound value to false and ALL of the UseLuclin models to
False (I have only shown you the first two from my file).

On the options tab in-game turn your clip plane right down and opacity
to cut out spell effects.
