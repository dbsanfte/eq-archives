Low server population....

With fewer customers, your petitions will get answered quicker..

I had to petition last night due to a bug with the Skiff in Erudin.
(it is out of sync with the boat) The guide answered within 5 minutes.
I was told that they were aware of the problem, but that they did not
have permission to summon players to Qeynos. The guide then suggested
that I ask for or buy a port from another player. Not much help. The
guide wouldn't even levitate me so that I could run out to the boat
when it zoned in.

So I risked the sharks and worked on my swimming skill. I was able to
get onto the boat when it ran me over. In the end it worked out OK,
but have you even smelled a wet Barbarian :-P

I am still a bit peeved about it. The skiff has been broken for more
than a week now. You would think that they would have "permission" to
summon players by now.
