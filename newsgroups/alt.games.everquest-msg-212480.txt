It depends on the debugger and the system on which I'm debugging.
There are scenarios where the program is not equipped to "know"
it's being debugged, and the act of debugging it won't change the
outcome (assuming you don't change anything while debugging).

I agree that my programs don't have free will.  I was just disagreeing
with your statement:

: search for understanding of our universe is that to affect the universe 
: you have to be in it. There is no such thing as an outside observer, 
: observation is interaction.

In my opinion god can 'debug' the universe.  He can observe without
interacting, if he so chooses.  Just as I can, in the mini-universes
of my computer programs.

This book looks very interesting, and right up my alley.  Thanks for
