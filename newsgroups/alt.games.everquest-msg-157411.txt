I've just installed PoP (bought it from Station store and it shipped to
Ireland in 3 days) but I can't get in as I think a patch is going on (10am
GMT ish) but one thing has struck me - there is no mention of the PoP AA -
no documentation (even the back of the box doesn't mention it).

As I said, I can't get in to check yet, but, has anyone seen anything
PoP-related in the AA screen?

Cheers,

Tzen
