Never tried to run EQ on a laptop at all.  First thing that comes to mind 
to try is to run EQ in windowed mode at 800x600, and see what happens.  
Keep your windows screen resolution at 1280x800, just set your EQ 
resolution to 800x600, and run it in a window, that should keep you from 
having any visual artifacts due to running your LCD display at anything 
but it's physical pixel resolution.  Other than that, it could just be 
the hardware, such as the video card, and/or system memory you have in 
the laptop that is causing the problems.
