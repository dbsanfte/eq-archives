Ellos everyone. I hope I dont upset too many of you with my question,
I know some people hate cheaters...I just hate spending soooooo much
time in the game farming for plats and doing other things for plat ;-)
when I have just heard you can buy plat and receive it in the
bazaar?!?!

Any suggestions for the best place to buy plats?  Are some sites more
reputable than others?

Thanks all.
