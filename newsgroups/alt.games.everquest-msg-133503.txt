Hi, New Semi-lurker here :)
Time does pass on a character even when logged doesn't it? I mean your
corpse rots whether you are playing or not... time just passes slower when
the account is not "active" I think I read somewhere that a character will
run out of foodstuffs even when not being used.  I could be mistaken though.
