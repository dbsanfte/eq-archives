Hmm, so all that's left is the mob that drops the MT and then goes
merrily rampaging amongst the casters, and it won't matter unless
he's pretty close to being within a single manaburn of being killed,
in which case the Wiz is probably already trying to take him down
whether he kills the MT or not.  So, as you say, it simply doesn't
add much.  No wonder they're refunding AA points to manaburn Wizards.

Oh well, at least the proposed changes have resulted in correction
of a number of erroneous views I had about high-end raiding.  Overall
I'd have to say that makes it a good patch for me, lol.

In a more serious vein, I'm guessing that it won't take more than a
week, tops, for all you raiders to adjust to the new ruleset, based
on what I've noticed in the past.  I do hope that, in the end, VI
does manage to make the big battles more interesting, as I am hoping
to manage to join in a few of them myself.
