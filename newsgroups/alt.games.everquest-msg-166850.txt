It varies from person to person...it is a loosely defined convention among
players, its strongly enforced by plaers and as such those slight
differences can cause some major arguments....also its abused by many who
realise that by shouting about camps they can get a lot more attention
from other players on the issue and yet keep the GMs far far away.

Thats how I would interpret it myself....I would also add that I would
expect someone to actively be present and prosecuting the camp to be
holding it....or at least let someone interested in a pull or two take one
while they med or heal up (if nothing else it helps keep spawns
broken)...and then when ready they should be able to go back to holding
it....again we get into the grey areas here with different players having
different ideas

On AB it generally is considered a camp....certainly if you shout Camp
Check in CC, the answer geonids comes back frequently. And this is where
camps falls over....a zone regularly hunted by a bunch of people who got
to know each other spawns a defined special camo that doesn stick to the
general rules....this gets propagated to the new players as they come
in...but if you dont know hen some zones get these wider camps that
everyone in the zone accepts...as camps are player conventions, and the
sanctions and control of camps is entirely in game player driven then such
a consensus decision has as much weight as any other.

Part of the problem is that a small unch of players can create a new style
of camping by being in an area for a coupla days as the only population of
a zone and then get ratty when you arrive and lagh at their choices 9Guk
on AB is a prime example - exactly how much you can camp varies from day
to day and then you get people claiming scryer spiders and knight saying
'ah but its always been acceptable to do this'
