I'd seen the same thing happen once before as well.
I logged on and did a quick friends check. I see a friend of mine that is
now a L1 Rogue. She was a L29 cleric. I send her a tell asking why she'd
created a new char and got rid of the previous one. She replied that this
was a new char for her. I was confused. She then said she just changed
servers to my server. After clearing up the confusion, she logged off. Never
saw her again. Original friend was back on later that nite and said she
didn't have any problems logging on. I told her about the conversation and
she was really confused as well.

This also happened on the 7th Hammer server.
