Hey, I think there should be bank keys. Something like, Go up to a banker,
say "Give me my Key" and he will give you a key that activates your bank.
These keys should be lore , but not no drop. And you could give them to all
your characters, so that would make transfer like 100x easyer. And you could
even give them to friends, or whoever you trusted. To use the key, pick it
up, and hover over the banker, and hit U. Simple as that. Hit me back with
some feedback
