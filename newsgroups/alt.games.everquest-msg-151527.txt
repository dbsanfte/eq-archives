As opposed to the paladin attacks that hit... one mob?  So wizzies aren't as
omnipotent as they used to be, so you have to spend a little more mana to
multi-kite.  That doesn't make you broken.  You can still do that better
than the rest of us.

Graffe is also a dedicated wizard site, and as such, likes to see new, more
powerful spells come out.  Do you think the data is a little tilted?  From
what I've seen in groups with Wizards, three tanks beat the stuffing out of
a mob until half health, then the wizard ends it.  So, the wizard has
already done three times the damage of the the tanks.  That doesn't sound
like a low DPS.  Maybe if you count the time while the puller is searching
for the next mob....

Try soloing without gear as a paladin.  Hope your H2H is maxed >_<

And we can barely take on blues with good gear, let alone taking on multiple
mobs.

So, the fact that necros are good at soloing, and nothing else, makes
wizards a broken class?  Necros are the best soloers in existance, of course
they're going to do better than you!  Try matching that as a paladin.

I swear, you should be required to have at least one melee up to 30 before
you're allowed to start a wizard, druid, or necro.
