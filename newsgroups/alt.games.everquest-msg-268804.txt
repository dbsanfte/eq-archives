When a high level char sits by and through healing, buffs, doing damage 
themselves, makes it so a lower level char is killing many times the 
amount of mobs they could kill on their own and leveling waaaayy faster
than it would be possible for that lower level char to level through
soloing or grouping with similar level char.

> Kill stealing.

Taking a mob that someone else has already engaged in combat. (Sometimes
KSing is also used to describe taking a mob that another person has
'camped' <i.e., been sitting there waiting for it to spawn>)

> Buff bots.

Chars who sit in PoK and seemingly do nothing but buff other people's
chars for profit.
