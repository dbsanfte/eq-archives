Yes but they aren't the same thing. The crime is judged on whether it 
was intentional or not. IMHO the motive, whether it be greed or hate or 
whatever, should not be considered when determining the *punishment*.

Okay then to be more specific, killing someone with intent and a motive 
of hate towards the victim and others like the victim as opposed to a 
motive of greed, power or simply a total disrespect for human life for 
example) is now a hate crime and warrants a harsher punishment.

Because the motive is irrelevant in determining the punishment for the 
crime. It leaves too many grey areas open for abuse.

Consider the case of a killer who murders a disabled person. Should this 
killer be receive a harsher punishment because it is determined that he 
hates disabled people, than if it was determined he simply did it for 
the fun of it? If so, why? Why should he be punished less because he 
didn't hate the victim? The same crime was committed, the victim died 
regardless. Surely the victim is entitled to the same justice whether 
the criminal did it out of hate or not?

You will be punished under the law for killing anybody regardless of who 
they are.

Your example is murder. I am asking why murder should be considered a 
hate crime because the motive is not popular? Why should killing Jews be 
punished more harshly than killing non-Jews? If person A kills 6 Jews 
because he hates Jews, and person B kills 6 random anyones because he 
wanted their wallets or he thought it was fun, why should person B 
receive less punishment than person A?

There is under hate crime law.
