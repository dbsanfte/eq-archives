Depends on the the way the RP server is set up as to whether I will play on
it, but I am quite interested.  I would probably play a Half Elven Paladin,
which is what I currently play.  It might be a hard class and perhaps hard
to roleplay, but I find I get a lot of enjoyment out of roleplaying him and
getting called 'a true knight' etc.  Plus Half Elves are (IMO) the best
looking race, especially in plate.  (Just hope Luclin doesn't muck that up).

Personally, I think that an /ooc channel would have to be a must, unless no
new players are allowed to join, as there are many game interface questions
etc. that get asked in the normal servers all the time.  It would be really
great saying 'Hail good sir, wouldst thou be so kind as to tell me how I can
uh... er...dictate?....my....eh....commonly repeated....er....sayings?'
(macros).

Then there are as many have pointed out the commonly used abbreviations or
synonyms or we always use, 'TRAIN...' being one of them.  I had actually
thought of using this as a macro on my current server for roleplaying:

/shout 'I am being chased by highly dangerous and aggravated creatures, may
I suggest to be wary!'
/ooc 'Translation: TRAIN TO ZONE!'

Will abbreviated place names be accepted?  Will Druids have to start saying:
'I am teleporting all those who respect nature to North Karana, Butcherblock
Mountains, West Commons.....' ?

Obviously duels and guild wars will be a big thing as PvP will not likely be
implemented for good reason.  Perhaps a setting that allows automatic
acceptance of duels would be in line (players can choose either on or off
naturally, or it would be just PvP), although I suppose one can have a hot
key for it and it doesn't take that much to type /d.

Just a few thoughts anyway.
