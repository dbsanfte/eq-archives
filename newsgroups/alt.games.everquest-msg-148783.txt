I think I just got lucky, but with my bard around level 15, I used to get
paid by people to guide them through various zones. I got paid by three
people in a row one day in North Karana to guide them from NK to the bank in
High Hold Keep. I've also ran people from Qeynos to Freeport and vice versa.
I also made a fair amount of money tracking corpses in Ocean of Tears and
Timorous Deep.

And of course, charm and chant kiting Hill Giants is always good money  =)
