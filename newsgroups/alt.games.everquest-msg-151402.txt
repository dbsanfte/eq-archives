> Oh, and parry's bloody useless, an' all.

Be sure you've trained first and if they've fixed the boats, one of the best
places to train is on the boat from Freeport to ButcherBlock going up and
down from the the upper deck to the lower.  The ride takes about 20 minutes
and you should get about 20-30 skill ups per trip.

By the way, most rogue skills are useless.  They are bones you have been
thrown, try to look thrilled.
