OK here's a tip, altho a little late now
If you are going to retire/take a break for a prolonged period sell any
expensive items you have first, you can then buy them (or better) when/if
you return.
I started to do this to my warrior not so long ago. Got 5k for my cobalt
gaunts then a week later changed my mind and bought a replacement pair for
3.5k
Prices fall at an alarming rate, saw Felhammer for 5k (the guy was
desperate, I know) I paid 8k and that was cheap, not 3 weeks ago.
