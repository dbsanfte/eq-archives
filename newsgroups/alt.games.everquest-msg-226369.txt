You probably handled it best, though I doubt I would have been able to 
exercise that kind of self control. I find the older I get the less 
tolerance I have of stupid/inconsiderate people.

This kind of thing is the reason I fully expect myself to hang a heavy bag 
near my desk some day. Taking the high road seems to take its toll 
sometimes.
