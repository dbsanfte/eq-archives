Does life itself fit within the context of 'the universe as we know
it'?

If you mean you believe there can be no life without a Creator, say
so. But don't go saying a living, conscious being would be
deterministically forced and predetermined to walk a certain path
around a rock unless there were a God around to say "look at the
pretty little thinking things, I think I'll stop making their random
actions preordained". Because that is what you sound like to me.
