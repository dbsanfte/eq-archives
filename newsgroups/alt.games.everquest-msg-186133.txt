Number 1.  nobody is asking you to play.
2.                nobody is asking you to transfer your characters to a new
server
3                if you really don't like it just don't play the game and
find something else to do.
4                tired of hearing grown ups cry all the time about the game.
If u wanna play then play and have fun.  If it isn't
                   any fun then don't play.

5                let me see you program a game and see how fun it is
