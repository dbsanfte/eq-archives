I just bought it recently myself, so I'm in the process of giving it a whirl.
So far it seems fun.  I like that there is a lot more variability in the
amount of grouping that I'm able to choose, (group and do instances or solo if
none of my friends are available.)  Haven't tried the tradeskills yet, but I
don't see how they could be as good as EQ2's.   I really liked those.

Anyways, if you pick it up, I'm playing Davian on Bloodhoof.  Feel free to say
hello :)
