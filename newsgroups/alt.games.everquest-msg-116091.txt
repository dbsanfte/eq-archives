Because they were there for at least 5 hours, at which point I went to
sleep, when I woke up, another 4 hours later, they were still there, when I
came back to CoM about 3 hours after that, they were still there, 3 hours
later, when I left CoM again, they were still there, and they were still
there when I went back to CoM again the next day.
