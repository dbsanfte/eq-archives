Also since you are in HighKeep anyways, once you get to lvl 22 - 24 ish you
can solo Osargen in the prisons of HighKeep. Great XP. You will die a few
times figuring out how to solo him but here a few tips. Of course be at full
mana and health. Sstand in the corner that is to your left as you enter the
room. Root Osargen and nuke with smite, continue nuking and rooting. If you
do it right you might have to fight one prisoner at most. DON'T ever turn
your back on him, he hits hard. Keep all your buffs on. You will get XP here
until 31st lvl. One of the few places my cleric could solo. Be warned that
you will die a few time until lvl 25. Osargen spawns at different lvls. 22 -
24 I think Mainly you will die when your root on him breaks.

Good Luck

Sounds like you just need some new scenery.  I'd suggest looking at the
Hunting Guide at www.EQAtlas.com.  The chart should give you some pointers
on new areas to try, based on your level.  Get out there and see the
world(s)!
