Or someone who is realistic and harbours some semblance of a clue.

I've never read a SWG board or actively researched the game in any way, but 
I do have 2 co-workers that were in Beta who would keep me up to date with 
how it was progressing.  The game was not ready for release and by the 
sounds of it, SoE wasn't ready to release it.

If someone plays a MMORPG and did any kind of research on SWG and are 
surprised by the problems at release, they're an idiot.  If they play EQ, 
planned on buying SWG at release, and -didn't- research how SWG was 
progressing, then they're a moron.  If they're mad at the release then 
they're a fucking idiotic moron, and that's putting it nicely.
