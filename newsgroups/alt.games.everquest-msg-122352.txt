The main problem is whether or not clicking "accept" can function as an
acceptance.

Suppose I offered to sell you my car, and specified that you could indicate
acceptance by throwing a bucket of fish onto my balcony.  If you throw a
bucket of fish onto my balcony, they will in fact be a valid acceptance of
the proposed contract (well...unless there is something in whatever state's
law is relevant that requires contracts for the sale of a car to be in
writing...let's ignore that possibility).

If, however, my offer had specified that you were to indicate acceptance by
playing Everquest tonight, then if you play Everquest tonight, that would
not create the contract, unless you wanted it to.

What's the difference here that makes the first a valid acceptance, and not
the second?  The difference is that in the first case, throwing a bucket of
fish, you are doing something that you would not normally do.  Indeed, it
would normally get you in trouble to throw a bucket of fish onto my balcony.
The only thing that makes it OK is if you are doing it in order to accept my
offer.  The law presumes that rather than commiting an act of vandalism, you
were trying to accept my offer.

In the case of you playing EQ tonight, that is something you quite
reasonably can do without intending to accept my offer.  There is no legal
reason you would not be playing EQ, and so the law would not see you doing
it as indicating that you wish to accept my offer.

Now, let's consider the EQ EULA.  The argument that scholars who say such
agreements are invalid make is that clicking yes on every annoying dialog
that comes up is something users normally do.  (Which is true...check out
any good book on user interface design, and one of the things it will tell
you is that users generally don't read things....when the computer gives
them a dialog, they don't read it.  They just press whatever button they
think will make the computer happy).  Clicking "I Agree" does not indicate
that the user actually wants to agree.  Hence, there is no contract.  As
long as the user doesn't do anything with the software beyond what is
allowed by copyright law, they are simply doing what every normal user does,
and so no legal intent can be inferred from their actions.
