I did this a few weeks ago so I won't swear to it but I'm PRETTY danged sure
I did this (I'm a gnome and amiable so I don't need benevolence though I may
have cast it anyway).  I was following the castersrealm walk-through to do
it.

Well, back to Stofo maybe tonight and once again hail him and say everything
that the castersrealm thing says, then will bop over to Ak'Anon and talk to
Rilgor again saying exactly that phrase.  Thank god my 49 druid and 51
enchanter are on different accounts. :)
