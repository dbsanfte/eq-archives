No, his point is valid, and it's sad that you're as blind to it as the
developers.  Oh, by the way, don't you think that maybe, just maybe,
he distinguished "Monks, Rogues, etc" from "casters and hybrids with
KEI" is that he is quite well aware of exactly what KEI is and what
use it is/isn't to the various EQ character classes (most/all of which
he has played)?  OTOH, I'm betting that your apparent need to state
what he plainly took to be obvious goes hand-in-hand with your apparent
ignorance of the fact that non-casters will occasionally seek out KEI
when doing tradeskills, putting the lie to your claim that they "cant
use kei".

Oooooh, I've been cut to the quick by your "sharp as a half-inflated
beachball" wit.

I sure hope I never have to share a highway with you, it's scary enough
with all the other geniuses out there.
