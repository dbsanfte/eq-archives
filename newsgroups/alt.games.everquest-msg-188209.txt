That's what I am afraid of, though I can't really picture them nerfing
a zone as empty as the Hole tends to be.

The revenant was hitting for 139 and nuking for 400/500, which put him
on the very upper threshhold of what my warrior could solo with the
lower level Harebell backing him up. Not something I could guarantee a
win against every time. When soloing, if (after a test fight or two) I
can't expect to win every time, it isn't worth the risk to do it by
myself. But I really really wanted to try that spot out....

If I can't do it it means back to highkeep which is driving me insane
with boredom or up to luclin and try to endure the poor framerates and
memory leaks....
