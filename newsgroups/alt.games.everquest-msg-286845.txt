Ok, so you've covered the basics of runspeed, SCM, extra spell slot, etc?
Good enough.

Statis is 1/2/3 minute -1000 magic resist mez to L73.  Nightmare stasis is
3 minute -1000 MR to L74/76/78.

Enchanters get hit worse than most classes with level-based limitations.  It
just sucks to be lower than max level for a given expansion, I'm sorry to say.  And 80's going to be just as bad, obsoleting all spells and abilities
capped at 75 and 78.

For me, Stasis hasn't been that big a lifesaver since the cap went to 75.  By
level 72 (after annoying faction work) you have Perplexing Flash
(short-duration, -110 chromatic resist, long recast, works to level 78) to
lock down a resistant mob, then tash and bewilderment (normal mez to level
78).

Dopple saves my life regularly, and rank 3 even has enough hit points to
survive a round of hits :)

It's possible to have enough aggro that dopple doesn't taunt.  And it's pretty
easy to get aggro afterward.  Most of the time it gives you the critical 3-5
seconds to get a mez or stun off, or a heal to land, or the warrior to regain
aggro, or whatever.

I'd put this in the same category as stasis: useful, but problematic and not a
first-tier AA.  The problem is that I often manage to hit it JUST as the mob
swiches back to the tank, which switches the mob back to me or the cleric and
kills us.

Epic's a 1.5s cast, and draconic is slower than that.  I use eldrich as a
backup, casting after my other runes are down.

/agree.  These and Dire Charm back and the day were the reason to play an
enchanter.  My party is almost never the same group for more than 15 minutes
at a time :)

Ehn.  I hate recasting buffs, and I end up casting on non-grouped friends and
people a lot, so extension was worth it to me.  You'll get VERY tired of
recasting Ward of Bewilderment, but you'll also never want to let it wear off,
so buff extension becomes valuable just for that.

Quick buff (to level 2 - level 3 doesn't do anything if you have other spell
haste avenues) is useful too, if only for rune casting.

>Charm aa's - yum. I don't have any, i was going to get TD but i could
>never justify it.

TD3 is darned nice - I mostly duo with a shaman or trio with shaman and
cleric, and we very often use charm for tanking and dps.  The L75 charm works
on things up to 74, and generally do enough damage to be worthwhile.  
 
Edict of Command I haven't gotten around to yet - I pretty much never want to
charm things where I can't recharm when it breaks.

>Spell crits and crit damage boost are cool AA's but i never got around
>to taking them seriously. I nuke a lot. A lot.

When I'm not charming, I'm nuking.  Crit nukes are a requirement to do
adequate damage, and even then it's not that much.

>I recognize the constant nuking is a great reason to invest in
>these AA's, but that feels like giving up and admitting worthlessness.

Yeah, it's not special but it's still useful to the group.

Mez mastery is a must-have IMO.  It makes the PBAE mez last long enough to
tash and recharm, or to use a real mez on 2.5 mobs of a big pull.

It's hard to tell exactly where the cutoff is.  I noticed a HUGE bump when LR
went in, and I've dutifully bought all avoidance (and 10 of mitigation) since,
but always with enough other changes in mobs and playstyle that I can't tell
how much it's working.  Conventional wisdom is to max out avoidance and drop a
few into mitigation.

The ability to survive a round of hits matters a lot - I'm proud that I have
to manage aggro, but it sucks for my group to die when a mez resists.  Putting
points into survivability is just plain required.

Agreed.  I maxed out int and cha, and put some into sta, but don't much care
about others.

>I don't have subtelty but i don't tend to pull aggro - i see this as

The memblur AA rocks.  Being able to reliably (90%+) blur things makes life
easier so often you won't believe it.  And the change to resting regen makes
it even better, as you now know for certain when you're out of combat.

>How do you pull aggro nowadays anyway?

Tash or slow on incoming usually gets me aggro briefly.  If I'm grouped with a
good tank, it doesn't matter.  If the shaman or my pet is tanking, it's
occasionally an issue.

>Gather mana ... crystal AA's

Gather mana is irrelevant to rez recovery nowadays, but it's crucial to my
normal play.  The ability to say "M20, good to go" when your group has
just survived a big pull and you've kept things mezzed for a long time
is delightful.

The mana crystal AA is nice for rez, and for a backup 1000 mana to keep in
your pocket.  The healing one is a bit too small to be useful - 1000 hp just
doesn't change the outcome of a fight.

Some you didn't mention but I'd recommend:

Channeling focus.  It may just be me, but I get hit a lot.  Channeling a mez
through a hit saves me often.  

Veil of Mindshadow.  10 minute recast and 36 min duration lets you keep it up
all the time if you can take the 100 mana/tic drain.  80% damage mitigation,
stacks with all runes.

Color shock.  Recast is too long to be used all the time, but it's great
when runes are gone and you're getting hit.

All the others I can think of are obvious and/or useless.
