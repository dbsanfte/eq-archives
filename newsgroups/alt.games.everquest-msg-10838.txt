I would guess that you have the wrong size.  As a half elf I think your wear
medium, but I can't remember exactly.  That's the only thing I can think of that
would cause this.

You've got it.  Usually 3 is my max twist.  Some say 4 is somewhat doable if
you're keen on the timing, but not with my connection.

In a few more levels you'll have your song which increases your running speed
and your heal song, both of which will make your life a LOT easier.
