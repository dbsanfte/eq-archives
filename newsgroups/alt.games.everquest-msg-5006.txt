I'm having problems since a few patches ago, too.  But just to toss out
something off the wall that was a problem for me before....

...If you have a home LAN make sure that none of your LAN cables go anywhere
near a big electrical field, such as a UPS.  This goes for the router/hub as
well.  I assume that a phone line that goes by that electrical field would
have the same effect.

Unfortunately that's not my problem now. :-/
