I liked to snare , root ,dot, med then when root broke or the dot stopped
stand up to root and dot until it was dead.
This way ,sometimes ,you finish the mob off and have almost full mana.The
only think to note is your surroundings as this method takes a little
time.Nothing worse than doing your first round of spells sit down and get
womped by some wondering mob, now you've got 2 pissed off creatures out for
blood.
