  I know we are told not to transfer the game or account to anyone =
however I HAVE DONE IT!!!

  I AM GUILTY -=20

  I purchased the game and played a character until level 5. I then =
transferred it to my girlfriend!
  Will I be punished??!!

  I also did the same and gave that one to my daughter. Am I to believe =
that a 9 yr old child must purchase this game on her own and use her OWN =
credit card to pay for it!!

  What about the girlfriend who refused to play unless I made it easier =
for her by getting her the first few levels?

  Does that mean I am evil?!??
