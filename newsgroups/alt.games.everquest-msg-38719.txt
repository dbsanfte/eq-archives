After such incredibly buggy recent releases like AO and WWII Online, I'm
very cautious toward any new releases.

Actually, just before AO was released, several characters I'd never heard of
before showed up in the GFay /shouting and /ooc'ing on how sucky EQ was, and
how great AO was going to be, and how everyone who was k3wl was going to be
over in AO.  I'm familiar with advertising, and sometimes underhanded
propaganda is part of the 'psychological warfare' over customers.  When I
smelled that tactic, I immediately sensed that AO was probably going to
suck, and was desperate to get customers while they could.

I'm beginning to smell that tactic now with DAoC.... people I've never heard
of are showing up in the newsgroup, all saying how EQ sucks, and how DAoC is
going to rock.

I'm going to wait until DAoC is actually out for a little while before I
even consider thinking about maybe possibly buying it.  Maybe.

Too many other recent releases have been utter bombs.  I'm not going to
shell my money out on something untested.  I've seen it all before.

I'm more excited about the possibilities with WoW.  But even for that, I can
and will wait until I know I'm not just flushing my cash down the drain for
something I can't play.

Seems like both the gaming industry (and many gamers) have forgotten the
harsh lesson of "Red Baron II."
