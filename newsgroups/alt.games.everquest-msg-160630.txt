It has to do with the merchants accumulated cash flow.  It a particular
merchant is overwhelmingly used by PCs as a buyer (i.e. they dump their
loot there), he will in time begin to pay less and charge more.  If his
accumulated cash flow reverses direction his prices will move back.  I
have seen this repeatedly on multiple merchants, including deliberately
moving a merchants prices in a particular case where I wanted to convert
a lot of coin into gems, I took some time buying one peridot at a time
(clicking "done" between purchases) and watched his prices improve by 3
copper per transaction (you do have to exit/reenter the vendor interface
to get the effect, prices stay the same for each "session").  Note this
is not a global thing, as another poster was claiming, but is specific
to each vendor.  One of the easiest ways to see this is to go to a
vendor who is the closest to a popular newbie area right after a patch
and check a few prices, then come back several days later and you will
usually see prices changed for the worse.

Other things affecting prices are:  a few merchants give worse prices at
all times (vendors in/near banks are notorious for this), bad faction
makes prices worse, and race relations also affect price.  With faction
at indifferent or better and no other modifiers you can get "best" price
from many same-race vendors with a CHA as low as 95.  With bad faction
and/or bad race relations higher CHA is necessary.  With Indifferent
faction I've seen prices still changing with CHA up into the 120s (I
recall 128 CHA as the best I could get on the particular character at
the time I saw this one, Half-Elf dealing with a Dwarf in the inner
Kaladim zone).
