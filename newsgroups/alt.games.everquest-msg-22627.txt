On Sullon, I've noticed High Quality Bear pelts being auctioned off for
ridiculously low prices.

Very few people have the cash yet to pay 20-30pp for a HQ Bear pelt...even
fewer have the tailoring skills to make a Tailored Backpack, and even fewer
have the cash to pay the normal 80-100pp for that.....  at least among the
Goods and Neutrals.

One of the regular items I've noticed being auctioned off among the Neutrals
is the Bloodforge Hammer.  Normal price:  20pp.  And quite a few wisdom
casters are wishing they could afford it.
