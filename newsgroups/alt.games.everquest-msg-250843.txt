I keep some of that: the sow (but for a CR I'll still accept a free one if
it's available), chipped bone rod, also an invis potion and a see invis,
and some food and drink.  But I don't bother with gear; I find if I'm
equipped to the point where I might be able to fight, I get distracted on
my way to the corpse. :)  So I just trust to the sow and/or invis to get
me there.

I also mostly keep it in non-shared slots.  I used to use the shared bank
for it, but (a) it got in the way of handing other stuff around, like items
to be sold by my bazaar mule, or handing shared WIS gear back and forth as
different characters tradeskilled, and (b) it was mostly for my monk, since
my druid can generate her own sow, invis, see invis, and food/water.  Now
that I've got a wizard going also, I might revisit using shared slots for
this stuff.
