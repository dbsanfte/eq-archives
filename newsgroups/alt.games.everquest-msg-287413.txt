I played EQ2 when it first came out.  I enjoyed it and liked the tree
structure of development where you chose Healer, Fighter, Mage, Scout
and then specialised at later levels.  It also had a good, easy to
follow tutorial.  I only left because of two issues - the need for
grouping (and not being able to get said groups with my assassin) and
the game needed a more powerful machine than I had.  I convinced a
friend of mine to have a go of the trial version so we could play
together.

Things have changed.  When you roll you have about 20 classes to
choose from.  It's very confusing for a new player.  Also, in the
trial, you can only choose one race (you can actually choose 2 but the
evil version requires more content to be downloaded).  This race is a
stupid looking fairy thing.  It isn't a good first impression.  This
race starts in an area right next to a quest giver so you talk to her
first and go questing.  There is no (obvious) introduction into the
game mechanics such as combat and vendors that you used to have.  Its
just go west and kill stuff.  My friend played it and went off in the
wrong direction, or missed the mobs and went too far and died
repeatedly to the first mobs he found.

I had a go and being familier with the game did a lot better than he
did.  I found the teachers that were missing later on, but too late -
after I had already done combat I found the combat teacher.  I played
for a few levels and decided to re-roll an alt.  I don't know what
triggered it but I could now choose any race so I chose Erudite.  This
race started on the old tutorial island from release.  You log on and
you have a yellow trail to follow - this leads you through a number of
simple tutorial exercises that introduce you to combat and vendors
etc.  I think that they really need to add this simple follow trail to
the fairy starting area.  It must be hurting their sales to have the
trial be so confusing to truly new players.

Also, the performance of the game was appalling.  Motion was jerky and
framerates low.  It even looked awful too.  I remember it looking much
better when I first played it but I had to turn down the options to
make it playable on my old machine.  It looked like it had defaulted
to those low settings and still had awful performance.  My friend
complained about the looks and performance too and he had a much
higher spec gaming machine than I did.
