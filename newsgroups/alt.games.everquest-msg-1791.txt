Few, if any, newsservers these days will allow auto newgrouping.  Even
fewer allow auto rmgrouping.  This is regardless of discussion in
alt.config.  You will notice that I did include the mandatory double
signature.

Usually, you need to ask your news admin to add alt groups.  So do that.

I've created several groups over several years, most of which are still
used and propagated, one which is not due to a stated temporary status
(and I should send an rmgroup) and one which was a joke that's still
pertinent today.

I've also found that a discussion in alt.config is tradition, but
frankly, useless.  The purpose of that tradition is to give those
people that don't know what they're doing a chance to get informed.  If
you want to argue that I don't know what I'm doing, feel free to start
up a flame; you do appear to have an opinion on everything.  Send an
rmgroup if you want.  By the time the game hits retail, there will be
enough propagation no matter how many rmgroups you send.

The newgroup command was sent because there is, and will be more of a
desire for the group.  I also wanted to incorporate some of the drive
behind the failed rec.games.computer.AO into the newgroup command, so
when some idiot posts a binary, people can legitimately say "hey, no
binaries allowed."  It will get the upcoming postings out of the UO
newsgroup, too.
