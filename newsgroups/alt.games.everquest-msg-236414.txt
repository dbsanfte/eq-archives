Actually its not even a few hours per town, in many cases.

For example, a dark elf cleric can lesiurely buy some player sold bone
chips from npcs until he has about 10 stacks, then go to just outside
the qeynos gates and give them to lashun novashire until he is non
KOS. He might either have to first go kill a few putrid skeletons at
the camp in South Karana, or if he thought about it just buy a human
form potion or make use of the one use halfling mask from one of the
quests for the cleric neck snare item. That mask can easily be gained
anytime the cleric is near neriak again.

There are only some place where the dark elf cleric has trouble,
mainly in rivervale since the halfling cleric faction can't ever be
raised due to them still being threaten in halfling form and the only
way to raise it being a quest at the halfling cleric guild.

Kaladim was insanely easy, I was surprised. Like qeynos, you just get
some bone chips, use the halfling one form mask or a potion then give
them to the dwarf paladin at the guild. When you are high amiable to
them, you will be amiable in dark elf form as well. Then the only hard
part about kaladim is the rogues outside the bank and the banker
himself.

The kaladim banker is on merchants of kaladim, however, unlike them he
is not dubious by default. So he shows where your merchants of kaladim
faction REALLY is. So the only way to KNOW when you are not kos is to
continually go down and check him. Since only he and the dwarf rogues
are kos to my cleric, this is pretty easy for her to check. she was on
the way to getting the rogues to dubious with bandit slaying when I
got bored.

Raising surefall glade to max allied was fun too ;) The only problem
is soon after I did they added the jaggedpine zone and one guy on
jaggedpine faction, to which she is kos. None of the surefall glade
people assist that guy and he is off in the corner, but it still
irritated me.

Basically, for the most part, the whole of qeynos is cake to raise
(except for one jaggedpine resident faction guy THERE also, at the int
caster's guild for a jaggedpine quest =(  ) The one harder part was
the int caster's guild, which is raiseable via Unser's call quest
while in halfling or another form. 

The whole of freeport is rapidly raised, with the remaining clerics of
marr being raiseable by continually giving altunic jardin in west
commons cloth shirts. So really it only costs some money to get non
kos even at the north freep cleric guild. I decided to get it to
indiff, by which time I had been max allied to the pally guild for
eons. This was before the form change potions were in the game so I
use the halfling one use mask to BUY the cloth shirts, since i had not
raised the faction of the vendors above dubious. It takes a TON of orc
killing to raise the particular faction the cloth shirt vendor is on,
which is Commons Residents. Some of the commons vendors are on the 
same faction as run of the mill freeport vendors, while some are on
commons residents.

Though you can raise these factions, its mostly moot unless you have
some mad desire to hang out at the kaladim bank. With just a little
work you can do the important stuff, like not being kos to guards when
you pass through.

With luclin, velious and of course POK, many people won't bother and
the game world won't be any less for them. I just found it fun back in
the day to ask for a port to surefall glade as a dark elf and have the
druid I was with marvel as I talked to the npc in the area ;)
