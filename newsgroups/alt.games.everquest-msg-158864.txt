Latest status update, from demon.service:

Subject: A quick routeing update
Date: 28 October 2002 23:25


A quick update about some of the recent problems. I'd have posted
something sooner but I was ill towards the end of last week and today
has been spent catching up on things =(

As I read this group in what is effectly my spare time [1] I've not
really got time to post into the numerous threads that have developed.
I'll see what I can do to adress some of the unanswered issues more
specifically over the next few days, no promises though...


Firstly, there have been a number of issues with the router known as
anchor-border-1.router.demon.net recently. We've been working with the
manufacturer to try and understand and address those. Some work to that
effect was carried out on friday night, however there are still ongoing
issues. We're still working on a resolution to these, at least one of
the issues we've seen is a an acknowledged software bug. In the meantime
our ops guys are keeping a careful eye on the box, Nursing it when it
looks unwell and probably kicking it if it misbehaves.


Secondly, some general oddness which causes very specific packets to get
lost somewhere within our network, and which we've been attempting to
localise and resolve for far too long [2], appears to have spread over
the last few days. While I'm not convinced we really understand it yet
we have a plan of action which should be being deployed in the next few
hours by our hardworking operations bods. Basically we're working down
our list of likely suspects and taking them into a quiet room for a good
kicking [3] Wether this will adress the problem remains to be seen. We'll
assess the impact that work has when it's finished and see where it
looks best to go from there.


In the meantime I'm heading off in search of pizza and bed while the
ops people get to burn more midnight oil, hopefull I'll have more time
to drop in here again tomorrow.



[1] Sometimes that includes browsing through while I mull things over,
    so it's technically company time, but I find reading and posting
    to this group more useful than doodling ;)
[2] In the five years I've worked on running service & content provider
    networks this is the oddest, most annoying and most elusive problem
    I've seen so far, and I've seen, traced and fixed some really odd,
    erm, stuff... trust me.
[3] You never know, one of them might confess...
