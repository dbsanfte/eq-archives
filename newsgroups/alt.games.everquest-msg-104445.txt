Nah, not going to bother.  My druid is 52...there's absolutely nothing wrong
with him.  They're damned handy to have in raids and damned powerful
already.

The problem with druids is that the morons in uberguilds SAY (mistakenly)
that druids are useless (beyond ports), therefore people buy into that
bullshit line.

Want to fix druids?  Fix the PR.
