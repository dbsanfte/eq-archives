Interesting thread...  This is a general reply to everything thus far...

My opinion is this, Yes, I would prefer that someone ask first, but I also
realize that accidental inspects happen.  I've done them myself as I use my
right mouse button to pan and so forth constantly...

Due to this, I always run with "/inspect off "  now.  If someone has a cool
weapon or whatever and I would like to know the name, I will either outright
ask them what the weapon is or I will ask to inspect them.

On the occasions before I learned about /inspect off that I did inspect
people on accident, I always apologized and generally was told it was no big
deal.

That's just how I personally handle it...
