My bard had one resisted too - against a red day the patch went in, none
since, just like the old days all the mobs came after me.

Interesting, Don't have atone yet on my cleric, but looking forward to
trying it.  On a side note, after calming, I acually had an angry mob
pass *through* a calmed one who stood there...calmly, never happened
before the patch.  I'm sure the nerf stick is comming...
Either that or SOE just wants to make the game easy, and next thing you
know Whirl 'till you Hurl will work like it did before I had an
Enchanter!  Wouldn't that be something else... Hmm.  Tempeted to go try
it now :)
