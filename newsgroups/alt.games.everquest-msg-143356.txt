You seem so sure that we don't...

Ack!  I have -tons- of RPGs in my closet! I've been found out!  What?  D&D 
doesn't count?  Oh, good.

}You seem to draw that line at a point where anyone without a prior

}of time, weapons that are designed only to kill people, and ammo
}that's designed to shoot through metal barriers including protective
}wear worn by law enforcement.  Lots of reasonable people draw that
}line on the other side, putting weapons which CAN kill but not quite
}so well in the hands of the public for self defense, recreation, and
}self-sufficiency, but reserving military weapons for the military.

Personally, I'm in the "I'd be most comfortable if nobody had such 
weapons" camp.  Unfortunately, some fucker had to go invent them, and 
well, the genie's out of the bottle now, isn't it?

}But, hey, if you're comfortable with the religious right gun-nuts
}down the road having a fully-stocked arsenal of military-grade
}weapons when some loony kills a kid or two with tracings of "that
}evil pagan witchcraft" around, who am I to argue?

The right to have them is different from the right to misuse them.  Would 
you feel better if the kids disappeared because the person in question was 
ex-military?  Or a pagan liberal gun nut (yes, they exist)?
 
Yeah, I can just see it.  "I'm sorry, sir, our background check reveals 
regular church attendance and republican voting, I'm afraid I can't sell 
you this gun."

Now, how many kids do you know of that have been shot by a gun nut?  And 
how many gun nuts do you know?  From my personal experience, I get zero 
and two.  I suspect I actually know more gun nuts than that who just 
haven't said, though.
