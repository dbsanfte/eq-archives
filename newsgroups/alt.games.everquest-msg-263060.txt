If they really used bazaar pricing to find tribute values,
then I don't see how it would be that much more work to use FV pricing 
on no drop items.  Any items that are still No Drop on FV would remain 
untributable.

Would sure be a nice payback to them for having made the FV server in 
the first place; to find it was useful as a tool for something they are 
doing for all the servers.
