No, you're not alone -- I agree completely with you!
I disabled ALL of the new models within 2 days of installing
Luclin (and not for performance issues).

To me, it looks like Verant got someone who was technically
capable of using a modeling program but has no artistic 
vision.  All of the armor/etc. is *more* details, but IMO,
looks far worse in most cases.  It's the classic case of 
"more is not always better".

Personally, the stance of many of the models looks like
someone just walked-up and kicked them in the ass really
hard and they got stuck that way...
