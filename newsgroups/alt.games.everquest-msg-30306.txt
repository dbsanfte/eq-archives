Especially as it is just a rehash of what he posted in the "don't point the
finger" thread, must of thought it was good ;ï¿½)

FYI, Lance (and as mentioned in a post below) "Euro's" drive on the RIGHT
hand side of the road, the same as you Americans (I can only assume this is
what you were getting at as to why people will train one way/side and not
the other)
If you had said "Bloody Brits" or "Bloody Aussies" then it would have made
more sense as both countries drive on the left.
