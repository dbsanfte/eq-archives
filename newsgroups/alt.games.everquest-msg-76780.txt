 There are two of them:

Ankhefenmut - Level 40 - Enchanter
Zazamoukh - Level 40 - Enchanter

 There are a pain in the butt and don't really drop anything worthwhile.
I heard that one drops something for a Ranger quest (maybe). When I
killed one it only dropped a Sapphire. They are tough. Even at 60 with
fairly nice gear I had problems.  

 At least one is in a  dead-end so it's hard to accidently train him if
you know where you are. He has a rather large aggro range though so if
you're lost and saw him he'd probably aggro. The other may be at a
dead-end as well but I can't remember.
