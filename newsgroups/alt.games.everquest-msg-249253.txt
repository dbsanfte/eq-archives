Its also wrong. My shawl was significantly shorter than my vt key. I figure
about 6 weeks of active hunting for key ( about 120 hours) . Shawl only took
me about 60 hours.

Significant ass slow hunting in me (about 4 weeks) and fungus grove(another
3 weeks).

I sure as hell understand the feeling that if I did this no one by god is
gonna get off easy. Natural reaction but wrong from a game design
standpoint.

Only part that required a raid was the emperor. That should have just been a
flag mob and forget all the other extreme bullshit. I did get my deep shard
while raiding tentacle guy long ago so maybe make him half a flag :p
