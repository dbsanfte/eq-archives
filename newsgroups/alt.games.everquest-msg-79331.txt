Ok, I have a 20 warrior human, 14 druid halfling, and 16 necro dark elf.  I
keep hearing that OOT is great for loot and exp but my halfling got killed
by some insane pirate on the sister's island as soon as he walked off the
boat.  Should I be in this zone with these characters or not?  Is
adventuring dependent on the island you hunt?

Thanks, Paul
