Anyone remember the map that was on the internet (I saw it about a year
ago), where some person had taken the entire Antonica map and cut and pasted
the zones from the (cloth) map, I believe into the approximate real
location?  It made for a pretty interesting view of how different the cloth
map was to the way the zones actually connected.

thanks in advance for your help
Parry
