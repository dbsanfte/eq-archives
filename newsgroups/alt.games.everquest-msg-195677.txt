Unfortunately, to some extent, there is no such thing as a "fresh" 
server.  You may not bring your pp or your other chars, but you 
can't discard the tremendous knowledge twinkage you bring with you.
Also, don't doubt there will be 50's inside of a few days, and 60's
inside a couple of weeks.  Many will be druids, played in rotation
by members of guilds to use as PL'ers, but they will be there.
