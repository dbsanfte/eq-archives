Nope - but if I start calling all Frenchmen arrogant assholes, all
Englishmen unhygenic whingers and all Germans rude and obnoxious what would
I be branded? Of course the correct term I should have used was "cultural
intolerance" but these days the usage of the word "Race" has been broadened
through common usage.

I don't particularily like it either, most of the recent examples of "ethnic
cleansing" I have seen reported in the media have little to do with
ethnicity but a lot to do with religion. Religionism?

No and Yes. I can generally tell the difference between Japanese, Chinese
and Koreans before they open their mouths. I can spot a Thai from mile away
with certain exceptions. For example - I would mistake a Lao for an Issan
Thai. Racial and political borders do not always coincide, but of course all
forms of discrimination are stupid.... unless it's directed at frenchmen of
course ; )

The problem is you have half a brain and can think for yourself. Do not
assume this standard equipment issued to all human beings...

Hmmn - if I were to call all Americans (or other Political Identity)
assholes at work I would be reprimanded if not immediately dismissed for
racial intolerance. Whilst it may not be specifically correct, it would
still be politically correct but at the end of the day I would still have
justifiably endangered or have lost a job.
