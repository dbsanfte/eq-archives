Depends on what you mean by "legal".  You're likely not committing a crime,
but you ARE violating an agreement with the game company.

Why do you think that?  AFAIK, SOE does not condone sales of accounts,
period, whether you delete all the characters first or not.

Right.

Not illegal, just prohibited by SOE.  You're perhaps more likely to get
away with it if you first delete all your characters, but you probably can't
get much money for it either.  If you DON'T delete your characters, you're
pretty clearly selling them in addition to the account time, regardless of
the text of your auction.
