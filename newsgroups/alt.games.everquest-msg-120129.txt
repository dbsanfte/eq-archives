    Maybe he means the beta version of Bristlebane. Kaylum, one of the
testers for Velious, has a great post on this on FoH's board. The original
intent: when Bristlebane popped, it could be any one of ten versions. One of
them was a true boss mob, tearing through the test raid team before they
even knew what happened. In transition to Live, though, something was messed
up and all ten Bristlebanes were popping at once. Nine of the spawns,
including the "tough" one, were disabled until the problem could be fixed.
But the person who designed the zone left Verant and the new person had so
much work to do to fix the zone's many problems that he likely considered
that temporary solution the permanent fix.
