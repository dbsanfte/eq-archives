I still say it's about a dead even tie. If somebody is competing with
you, and there's not enough spiders to hunt, run to LGuk and do the
heart spiders there. They drop tons of silk.

If I'm forced into tailoring with my wizard (which I may be later this
summer) I may well go down there on off hours if I can find them
uncamped and just load up my PBAOE and clean them off for a while.
