No what you want is for reward to be tied to effort and skill . It is by the
way . Any of the very rich characters could start over from absolute scratch
and be relatively wealthy in a fairly short period of time . Everquest is a
very open system for movement between the classes and is getting easier to
start over from the beginning not harder . Tradeskills however have NO
function in bettering your character outside of very few quests.

No . you want similiar types of characters to trade items for platinum and
have platinum regarded as a universal means of exchange. You dont want level
5 characters buying from level 30s or 30s from 60s. You want 60s to spend no
more plat buying from 5s then an average of the value of time saved worth
and time spent worth.

Floor prices payed by merchants and a good univeral money sink for real
benefit gained .
