Here is the mail I sent to Everquest's support.
Does anyone have an idea ? I'm living in France.

***********
I bought Everquest last friday, and tried until saturday 2:00 to patch it (I
always had the "z stream error" when I launched the Everquest program).
Actually, it worked around 3:00.

I played perfectly until yesterday afternoon, and then the software tried
again to get some patch. And since yesterday, I can't load the patches, with
the same error "z stream error" !!!

What can I do ?

Thanks for your help,

JP Madelaine
