Any players who subscribe to the Legends/Stormhammer server, please
can you clarify the changes to this dungeon?
For Iksar Monks (Or masochistic human ones with the faction) Droga is
the place where we have to hand in items for our Shackle of Steel.
There are many Mobs involved in this, currently deep inside Droga in
the Jail area.
Also, for a later part of the Iksar "mini-epic" (Whistling fists),
there is another hand in to a crusader named Arghest, also to be found
in these jail cells.

I gather that all the relevant Mobs wll be evicted from their cosy
dungeon dwelling and helped to relocate to the sunny surface world, in
the Frontier Mountains zone (Burynai caves sounds about right, though
where the burynai will go I have no idea... and as an iksar, I care
not ;-)

One thing remains - the "Stupendous Machine" - This is used to combine
the pieces from other sub-quests and a dagger-like object given by
Arghest. It currently resides, yes, you guessed it, in the Jail area
in Droga.

My real question - on Stormhammer has the machine also been moved to
the caves, or somwhere nearby, or do I face another inordinate amount
of CR's trying to get inside the
revamped-by-the-"Home-Front-of-Cazic-Thule"-team version of Droga?

Answers on a postcard please! Any help appreciated, thanks in advance.
