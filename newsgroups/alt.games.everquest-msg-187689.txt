Note I dont have this charm myself, but my guild has been farming it lately.
In Dulak harbor at the first boat there is a mob that drops a charm that is
very nice for casters. Its ability increases as your specilization skill
increases. For a guildy with 200 Evoke Spec the stats are +5 Wis/Int +9hp
+9Mana +9 MR.  This is from memory so it could be off a bit. The mob that
drops this is one of the first that you see as you enter the boat. He has a
place holder and seems to appear one in like 6-8 spawns. I dont recall the
name Im afriad but he is a named mob.
