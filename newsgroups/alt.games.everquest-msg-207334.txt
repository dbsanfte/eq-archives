My guild is pretty high in numbers... but most everyone is afraid to
go to Fear/Hate.

That... plus the fact that Severilous is never up... leads me to the
decision that I'll never ever ever get my warrior epic.

So... since I recently came into about 20k pp...

What weaps can I get that are better than the epic?

(Don't want to spend it all... want to save some for armor
upgrades...)

Thanks....
