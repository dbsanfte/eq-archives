As far as I know, there is no "glossary". Yep, it's just idiots who replace
letters with numbers (or an intelligent person using them to be sarcastic
about the idiots). So when you see someone here say "ph33r my l33t skillz",
most likely they're poking fun at someone who doesn't know how to spell
"fear my elite skills". I highly doubt anyone here would use this in any
other manner unless they're a troll. You have to dumb yourself down to read
or type d00d-speak.

BTW, if someone needs to make a reference to their "l33t skillz" then I
would gaurantee that they don't have any.
