In my case it was sony that coughed up the money when I 'formally 
complained'. So my cc company didn't have to eat the issue. If the cc 
had eaten the charges I'd have been mollified somewhat, but I can well 
afford to absorb the 12 bucks, and I would still be outraged that my cc 
had eaten the loss.... I'd have pushed the issue until Sony put up the 
money... as you said... just out of general principle.
