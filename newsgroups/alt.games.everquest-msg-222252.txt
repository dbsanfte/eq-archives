Is the account a hand-me-down?  I have one that used to be played by a
friend and when he changed his Station info, the account password for EQ was
changed.  He could not remember the old password and changed it using the
signup info.  That was fun.

Another time, I tried five times before I realized I had the Caps Lock key
on.

Last, the account was hacked.  Least likely, but has been known to happen.
Esp if you share the password with a guild.
