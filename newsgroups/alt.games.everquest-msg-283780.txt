Got in a group yesterday which happened to include a couple of 
enchanters, one 15 and one 13.  I was the nominal tank, there was a 
rogue and a ranger and a cleric rounding out the group.

Well, I'm not kitted out in any twinky way, naturally, it being the 
combine server, there's noone around to twink me anyway!  SO I'm 
weilding a Mino Slayer Axe, which is the best damage ratio I've managed 
to lay hands on, perhaps a bit slow for keeping aggro, but at this point 
I don't even own an alternative.

It develops that I have a hard time taking aggro off the rogue; if he's 
pulling I have difficulty even generating enough aggro for him to evade! 
  Could be thats partially his evade skills, of course.  But at any 
rate, its difficult.

Turns out if I pull, taunt, bash and then stack on lots of spells, and 
basically chain cast, I can keep aggro pretty well.  So thats what we do.

When I say chain cast, though, I mean EVERY time the Lifespike button 
comes ungrey, I hit it immediately.  Every time I finish casting a 
spell, I hit Bash and Taunt.  The mob has Clinging Darkness and Disease 
Cloud and I've Siphon Strength it, and now I'm slapping it for 12 damage 
and healing myself for 12, constantly.   Thats about as irritating as I 
know how to be, short of sitting down.

As an aside, I'm missing some spells that would doubtless help with 
this; the level 1 SK spell is a tiny nuke thats very cheap and quick, 
Despair is a debuff that reduces ATK, Scream of Hate is... well I 
forget, but its another Debuff (I think its an AC tap or something); 
more stuff I can stack on there the better it seems.  But those are all 
apparantly not on Combine till future expansions are unlocked.

Anyway, my point is, I'm fine with this.  Never sitting, cause I'm the 
puller, casting constantly... its a little like playing a bard, but its 
doable, and its working.   My mana bar never goes below 90%, and I'm 
actually generating a significant amount of "regen" for myself by chain 
lifespike.

Then the higher level enchanter has to run.  Once breeze drops, its a 
different story; now every pull costs me another 10 to 15% of my mana 
bar!  Fortunately, the rogue pulls up stakes fairly soon after this 
happens.

But I stop casting so many spells, and I stop being the single target. 
Sometimes I'm getting hit, sometimes its the ranger, or the 14 warrior 
who replaces the rogue.  Or when they're feeling antsy and start nuking, 
the cleric or the enchanter.

Overall, our efficiency drops to about half what it was; breeze means 
the damage is going to worse places, and that means the healing is 
chewing up more mana, it means I'm not lifespiking myself about 12 hp 
every 3 seconds, it means the mob isn't taking damage from my snare, and 
is hitting harder due to higher STR... but it also means the cleric and 
chanter don't have as much spare mana over and above the fact that they 
are spending extra keeping me and the others alive, because they too 
don't have breeze.

We got a bard in a bit later.  He was too low to have it anyway, but he 
said that the breezelike mana song is NOT available on the Combine 
server, which sucks for bards.

But my point is, I've never played a class where breeze made so much of 
a difference; I don't need clarity or KEI, because I literally can't 
cast enough to overcome the mana regen rate from breeze!
