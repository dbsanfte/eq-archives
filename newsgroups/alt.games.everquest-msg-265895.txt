Or how about the original Planes in EQ1?  You are going to try to kill a
*GOD*, for God's sake...and you have to take a number and get in line
because half of the other high level guilds in your world want to do the
same thing, at the same time?

Crowded dungeons *can* sometimes work in such a way as to not harm
immersiveness.  Blackburrow, for instance (no pun intended!).  That's great
when it is full of people, and I think that is because of the following
factors:

    1. It is the main source of Gnolls in the Qeynos and Halas areas, and
    so wiping out Blackburrow would be something that both of those cities
    would work toward.

    2. It is located close to the major hunting grounds of low level people
    from Qeynos, and low to mid level people from Halas.  All through your
    early levels in those areas, you are aware of the Gnoll menance lurking
    there.

    3. There are incidents.  Young adventurers staying too close to the
    entrance, and getting ganked by gangs of Gnolls.  Bold Fippy charging
    the gates of Qeynos itself--is he the precursor to a Gnoll invasion?
    Best get everyone available and go exterminate those bastards!

So, going into Blackburrow and finding 30 people there, and fights going on
in every part of the dungeon, works fine for me in terms of immersiveness.
It is war--Man vs. Gnoll!

I think there are three broad categories of dungeon, and which category a
given dungeon falls under depends a lot on the story of the game and where
the dungeon is located:

    1. Dungeons for which it makes sense to have them be full of
    adventurers, like Blackburrow.

    2. Dungeons for which you and your party should be alone.

    3. Dungeons in between.  They should not be crowded, but running into a
    couple other parties in there while adventuring would be fine.
