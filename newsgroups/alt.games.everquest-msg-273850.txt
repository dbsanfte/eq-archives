I wouldn't. But then, I'm not a simpering sack of shit, either. I read
the rules of a game before I play, and I try to follow them, and if I
screw up and get caught, I take my lumps. When the OP reaches driving
age and gets his first speeding ticket, he'll probably piss and moan
about the cop picking on him, too, rather than accepting
responsibility for his own actions.
