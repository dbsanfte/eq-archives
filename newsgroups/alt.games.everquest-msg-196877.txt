Being a ranger who has duo-ed with a shaman her entire career, I figured I
might share my 2cp on this subject.

I think both things - having shamans learn to tank mez and having rangers
learn to get and hold aggro - are viable.  While I've not done much
intensive raiding, I hear that rangers are just the thing to peel a mob
off an enchanter until it can be re-mezzed.  Just so...my husband put all
his gear-focus towards HP and AC, and as a result, when we got adds we
usually let him absorb them for a while, because it made regen more
efficient in the long run.

However...a little anecdotal information about the tanking abilities of a
shaman vs a ranger.  I believe this comes from when we were in our high
40's or low 50's...can't remember which.

At that time, my focus was HP and I was letting AC slide a little in favor
of HP.  My husband, conversely, had better AC than I did (I think he just
had better gear in general).  So it would stand to reason that his
mitigation (we'll ignore avoidance here) would be better than mine.  
However, when we took turns being the sponge, and later parsed our logs,
we found that the same mobs were consistently hitting him for larger
amounts of damage per hit than they were hitting me.

So while it has not been officialy said, we took that as anecdotal
evidence that there is a different damage mitigation table for rangers
than for shamans (and no doubt for every other class), just as there are
different damage tables.  For that reason alone, unless the shaman has
better HP regen (ala stoicism/torpor), I'd still choose a ranger of equal
gear to tank.  Can't comment on monks, though.

Incidentally, I had the odd situation of being in a guild that had more
rangers than any other class, and almost no regular plate tanks, and at
the time I was the most heavily equipped ranger.  So as far as I'm
concerned, a ranger can tank just fine.  That's my own little bubble of a
world, though.  And of course I was rarely without slow...a good shaman
could probably make a wizard think they were a tank. ;D

I also didn't freak out when mobs hit the shaman though...I knew he
could handle himself and he'd tell me if he needed me to take things
off him.  Getting his back into a corner was enough to keep his spells
from being interrupted.
