Fool!  Everyone knows that 13 is the sacred number in the bible. 
There were 13 tribes of "isrealites".  13 including MOSES who led the
nomads across the parted waters, from whence they rejected the rules
of man and god (puke) and worshiped the golden calf (terminus).  The
bible says that 13 is the number of rebellion!

13 is the combination of 1 and 0, the babelonian binary set which
parses the triangle/binary tree paradigm.  Thus the addition of 3. 
The pyramid pointing up represents the triad of the Dragon, Leviathan
(cthulu) and the False prophet (god-man).

The jews arent evil.  I am.

"The Tartars must be no less the punishment of god, visited upon
christendom for its sins, and the Tartars themselves the decendants of
the missing Ten tribes of Isreal who had worshipped the Golden
Calf(terminus) and had been penned up for ther idolatry within the
steppes of asia" --Fredrick II of Germany in a communication to Henry
III of England

"In the days of the anti-christ, a race of turks would emerge from the
land of Gog, and Magog, behind the mountains of asia, a race polluted,
and unwashed, using neither wine, nor salt, not wheat, and would cause
universal disaster." -- Profescy of unknown origin

"We dreaded that the nearest and most imminent danger to the church of
god arose from them."  -- John of plano carpini , frair of the order
of minoritys

"Mongols were the soldiers of the antrichrist, come to reap the last
great harvest"  -- Francis bacon

"When the people of Gog and Magog are let  through their barrier, and
they swiftly swarm from every hill, When Gog and Magog are let loose,
and they hasten out of every mound, When Gog and Magog are let loose, 
they shall break forth from every elevated place,  Then behold!  The
eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror and say:  Ah! Woe
be tied to us! We were indeed heedless of this warning; Yes, we truly
did wrong!
--Sura's 021.096, 021.097 of the Koran
