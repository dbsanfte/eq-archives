I apologize if I didn't make my situation clear.

I was a level 31 warrior at the time, poor. I gave recently a lot of crafted
to someone else and I didn't have the plat to back it up. I quested for most
of it a few levels ago so ya know, if I did it then I am stronger now it
should be less of a problem.

Anyhoo, with having less money then 15plat (I had about 5 or 7 on me)  I was
KOS to all of FreePort except North. Having him either camo me so I could
run to the bank or run to the docks is to much of a hassle. I didn't want to
spend forever on the boat (for some reason EQ has been dropping me when i
zone sometimes kinda scary dont want to risk falling)

None of my friends were on, and my guild has very few people in it. (I was
guildless and someone invited me so what the heck? =)

That is pretty much it you know the rest. I did later get a port (not much
later) for free...
