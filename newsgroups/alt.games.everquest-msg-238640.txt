I am deeply nostalgic for the crafting of SWG. Not the harvesting side of it
mind you! But crafting a hotdog of uberness was a lot of fun. I would have
loved to have been able to hang in there long enough to build a house. I
would love to be able to build up a house as I went in EQ2 without it
rotting if I go on holidays or become ill or whatever; that part of SWG can
be stressful to someone who can't guarantee regular access.

The new crafting tool in EQ is a step in the right direction (seems a little
buggy, many recipes missing for example, and on some of my characters I have
to craft the old way with a sewing kit but the new way with fixed items of
the same type because of a bug the guide says they will fix next patch
(groan!).
