Care to share with us your qualifications as a linguist, so as to lend 
some credibility to your claim? I'm not a linguist, myself, but of the 
two links I provided, one of them is the web site of a professional 
linguist, and the other was the Linguistics Society of America. Here 
they are again:

http://www.lsadc.org/ebonics.html

http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/aavesem/EbonicsQ&A.html

If that wasn't enough, here's one to the American Dialect Society:

http://www.americandialect.org/links.html

And another to the Center for Applied Linguistics:

http://www.cal.org/ebonics/

Now, I'm perfectly open to the idea that perhaps you do know more about 
linguistics, and about the difference between a dialect and "bad 
grammar" than all those people who do it for a living, but as they say, 
extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof...
