A tank is a tank up until level 40/45 ish... thats when the difference
shows.  Despite the latest class changes, people will still pick a warrior
over a paladin/SK for a the tank spot in the group.

HOWEVER, that doesnt mean they wont pick a paly/sk, but they will normally
choose the warrior if they see the two LFG at the same time.

And to answer your initial question, clerics are *the* most wanted class in
the game.  You're cleric, you've got a group, guild, raid whenever you want
:) Well so longs as you are a decent cleric...
