If I remember correctly the highest member in a group cant be over 1.5
times the lvl of the lowest char.
At the first levels there has to be another rule. Or lvl1 toons couldn't
group with anything above lvl2 (if EQ is rounding up!).
A difference of 5 lvls has always been a safe bet. Besides that you can
always try it and see if everyone gets exp. :)
