Verant wants tactics in EQ to be as simple as you standing in front of a
monster and trading blows with it until one of you dies. Every possible
tactical use of terrain, obstacles, or monster behavior is systematically
eliminated as Verant discovers it (or to be more precise, as Verant
discovers that significant numbers of players are aware of it). And if you
should discover some way of using tactics, of using terrain or monster
behavior to your advantage -- if you do what a person in the real world do,
in other words -- you are violating Verant's rules against "exploits".
That's what poor game designers do instead of fixing the game -- they
handicap the players.

So either play the game and enjoy what aspects of it you can, or move on.
This aspect of EverQuest hasn't changed in two years, and it isn't likely to
change in the future.
