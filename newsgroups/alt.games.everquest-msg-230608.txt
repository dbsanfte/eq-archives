Not so far as I can see...when I got an XP box I literally copied from one
machine to another by plugging in the old HD and dragging the folder.

Everything important is held account related and server side for
security/antyihacking  plus an install on one machine has no
specific relation to any given account as you can play on any
machine by logging in the other account.

Anything helpful like last station name I think is held in a log file in
the EQ folder, and the personalised files for each character are purely
cosmetic details like hotkeys etc etc.
