Since you don't say what you are doing, or how you are doing
it, its impossible to critique your technique other than the fact
that you let slip that you are losing exp... which only happens
when you die.

You have SOW, it is almost impossible for you to die if you are
paying attention and have the proper cowardliness installed.

Kill things when you can, when its clear you can't, run to zone.

If whatever or wherever you are fighting does not allow you to
do this, then you are indeed doing it wrong.

There are other approaches, but when a level gets you stuck like
this, go to the basics, kill blues, don't die, and you will eventually
inevitably level.  This is true of any class at any level that is capable
of soloing blues... but more true of SOW classes, who find the
"don't die" part easier.
