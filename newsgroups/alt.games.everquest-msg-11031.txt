Speaking of people being "saved" .. We had an incident here a while back
where a Jehova's Witness was driving around asking children if they believed
in God. If they answered yes, he killed them by stabbing, slitting their
throat, etc. to "save" them from the world. If they answered no, he killed
them for being a non-believer. At his trial, he shouted out "Kill the small
children! Then kill yourself! Kill the small children!" ..

Oh btw, he walked into an elementary school and seriously wounded 10
children. There were no adults around supervising them in the playground.
(This was before school started.)

He was within 14 miles if where I live at one point, and had driven within a
mile of it to get to the elementary school.

All in the name of religion. How many others have there been in history?
