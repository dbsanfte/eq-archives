hiya lamb :)

you prolly want "The Ruins of Kunark", it has both the original game and
the kunark expansion.

might as well wait on velious expansion, its a separate purchase and is
not "stand-alone", you won't be able to go there for awhile anyway.

when you first install you will have to update and that may take awhile
on a regular modem so be prepared for a long download.

as for tweaks, just see how it runs and go from there, there are some
changes in eqclient.ini you can make and there are some programs out
there that help you change colors and stuff but you will prolly just
want to play with the default setting till you get a feel for things.

read up on classes and races, try some different characters and have
fun!
