sorry if i missed the boat, but is anyone else annoyed by berserkers being
veiled spell casters? why not just make them casters instead of pretending
that the combat abilities aren't spells?

i tried one out and clicked the summon ability, moved, and got the message
"your spell has been interrupted" .....because it's casting a spell, just
without mana

and in combat, if you press the same summon ability, you can channel through
a few hits and get the spell off, though for this there is no channeling
message

berserker = ranger for people who dont want to wait to get am3?

and i'm not trolling, i just want to hear other peoples' ideas, and
hopefully if i've missed a post like this one someone can just point me
towards it =)
