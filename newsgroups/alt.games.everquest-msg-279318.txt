If money_lost_by_players_quitting_over_bugs < money_spent_to_fix_bugs then
yes, from a purely short-term business perspective, it is a good strategy.

I sincerely beleive that this time last year SOE were expecting to put EQ(1)
into a holding pattern with minimum investment after the EQ2 launch; the only
trouble with their plan is that EQ2 was - relatively speaking - a flop.  I'm
fairly sure that "reaching about the same subs level as EQ (or slightly
lower), after having spent $40million+ on EQ2" was towards the lower end of
their predicted business plan (to put it lightly).

If you look at SOE's actions toward EQ1 in the light of they expected EQ2 to
significantly surpass it's subs numbers, the trend of neglect makes more
sense.
