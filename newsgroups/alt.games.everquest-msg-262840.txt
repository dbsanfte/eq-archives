I think that some gearheads and overly technical players are losing sight of the fact that
the contribution and game experience are dependent on the player, not the character.

That said, I'm not offended by an out-of-the-blue AC/HP question.  Except when I get 'NM'
in return :->

Ubahd00d tells you, "ac/hp?"
You tell Ubahd00d, "1180/3140, buffable to 5.2k"
Ubahd00d tells you, "nm"
You are now ignoring Ubahd00d.

I always ask the AC/HP question when forming a group, or when joining a group with another
tank.  If another character has +1000HP or +100AC on my character, it's clearly obvious
that I'm nowhere close to being the first best choice for MT.

Best regards,

Tim ==
