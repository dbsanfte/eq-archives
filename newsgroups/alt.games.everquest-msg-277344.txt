1) if you want to kill 500 gnolls, go to the caves, train the second level
onto yourself, area effect the lv 9 gnolls, when rested, go to lv 3 rinse,
repeat! This is quite easy and fast, and a partner would be nice but is not
essential.

2) There are lots of people who will not lift a finger to help you.
Literally. I had crugybar the rock standing nearby. I could almost but not
quite solo the bastard. Right next to me was a tank and a healer (I'm a 17
brawler) who were killing grey crag rats over and over. I asked if they
could help for a minute. "No", they said, "he's a quest mob... they don't
drop loot". I pointed out that presumably he'd give them xp (possibly more
than grey crag rats) but it didn't sell ...

I thought about bribery... then went stuff it. I've helped out heaps of
people without asking for anything, and i certainly would have checked the
quest journal to see how i could help them. I had alot of collectables on
me, for example.

3) Nek forest is a lot harder than everyone says it is, and greying out by
grouping with someone else will not help you, but if they can rez you that
can help greatly. First i did a trial run, and when i was ready, i ran the
whole thing solo and made it. Now i just need to kill the three named
gnolls, and i'm stuck. :P

I hate the way they never seem to see there should be a solo option for
these things, even if it's kill another 500 freakin gnolls. 8-<
