The Vah Shir quests are progressive, and at the moment the mobs required
are dark blue for my Bard. My Ogre has progressed quite nicely to the
point where he needs sonic wolf molars to continue. Group needed at 22
but no groups in zone(. My Iksar just got citizenship a day or so ago
and is just starting the quest. I'm collecting the necessary shadeling
silks with the Bard as the mobs are very green at the Bst's 22. The drum
reward for the Bard's quest will be a nice addition and a lute comes
soon after that. Pottery skill needs to be a bit higher to continue, and
the progressive pottery quest, to me at least, is not a viable way to up
the skill as the recipes require rare nodrop items.

The gear will have to wait for the moment. My Cleric is in full newbie
armor as is the Ogre Beastlord. My Iksar Beastlord is still quite naked
as the newbie armor quest is not as comprehensive for Iksars and the
chest item is nearly impossible to obtain without a tracker to find the
mobs needed. Even then, the mobs are surrounded with very red other mobs
and quite often I was the only person in the zone. Corpse runs are not
my cup of tea!
