Think you had better just delete your mage if you are worried about a 25 -
40 hour spawn being the hard part of the Mage Epic. Try going to the 7th sky
in the Plane of Air ( in case you don't don't the higher the number the
relatively harder the area in that plane).
Not sure if I will ever get my mage Epic but not too worried about it they
are lots of fun to play either way. Besides the mage epic is worth getting
unlike other classes whose Epic item is terrible.
