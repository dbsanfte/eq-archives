"Later I asked Smedley to confirm the rumor that we would have new PC
models before the end of 2004 and he confirmed it. SOE is outsourcing
the project to another company, an act that vexes SOE artists. It's
their baby and they want to do the models but there simply isn't the
time, a statement we heard often. The developers who spoke at the
initial meeting stated that they want and expect Everquest to stand up
graphically to other current massive online games including EQ2. The
graphic update we battled through recently helps us get there."



Thank god!

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
