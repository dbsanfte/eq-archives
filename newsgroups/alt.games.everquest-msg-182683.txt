Meh.  Happens a lot.  A couple of guildies dueled on EMarr once - they 
agreed beforehand, no outside buffs, and no spells inside the ring (one 
was a bard, one was a ranger).  Well, the ranger adhered to his end of 
the duel, and the bard... well, he had aego *and* a DS on when he went 
into the fight.  He killed the ranger, who was higher level than him, 
and seems to think that this actually makes his dingle larger than the 
ranger's.  *rolled eyes*  I'll give you 2 guesses what the rest of the 
guild's opinion of the duel was.  The first one doesn't count. ;p
