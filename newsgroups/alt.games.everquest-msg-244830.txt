Too many times lately I've heard wimpy asswipes saying "I'm Livid
about this
situation!"


And my response has been "Ummmmmm, Ok, does that mean you are Mad
about it? or are you just really pissed off?"





Excuse the frick out of me but if you are mad about something, 
you'll do much better by saying it.
Say what you mean, Puh-fucking-leeeez.

the word "Livid" is some fucked up fake-assed way to say you are
pissed off
about something but are afraid of pissing off the person that 
you are pissed off with because you are too damn scared that they 
might turn around and be pissed off at . . YOU!
