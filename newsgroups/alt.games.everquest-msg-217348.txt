    Funny you should mention that, Nobles is my favorite Veksar camp and it
has seemed a lot nastier of late, but in my case there are too many other
factors to really isolate anything. (IE group composition is very different)

    Maybe you're barking up the wrong tree, and instead of nerfing the drop
rates at that camp they just made it tougher?

    Probably our collective imagination though.

Cheers,
James
