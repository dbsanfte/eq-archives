    Well, in this case I believe that the kid climbed into the parked
car and got stuck and then heat stroked.  The problem is that the mother
(term used broadly) was so wrapped up in her Kael raid or whatever that
she failed to notice the eerie silence that should not be descending in
a house with an active toddler.

   Well, no.  The problem is that the mother, and father if he was
around, simply didn't supervise the kid the way they should have.  She
could have been zoning out on a "Trading Places" marathon to the same
effect.

   But yes, I agree with Dita on the point that some one should have
taken the kid out of the car before it was too late.
