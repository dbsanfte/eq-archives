Ummm, "addition" == "more."

Not in my eyes.  The random killer is, IMO, more dangerous
to society as a whole than a selective one.  After all,
the selective one by definition isn't going to kill just
anyone, where the random one will.

One person rapes two women at different times.  He does the
exact same thing:  breaks into their home, grabs them as they
get out of the shower, forces the same acts, restrains them
the exact same way, etc etc etc.  The method of committing
the crime has nothing to do with target selection.

Sentencing guidelines are expected to have different results.
That's their whole purpose, after all.  The law enforcement part,
the illegality of an act, shouldn't.
