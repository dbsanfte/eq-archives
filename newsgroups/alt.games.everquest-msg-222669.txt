I am running the Pro version and I regularily swap between characters with
no fuss. With my bazaar mule and the fact I can now toggle between EQ and
desktop (the second best improvement since I last played, just behind shared
bank slots) it is not unusual for me to have EQ running straight for a day
or more with no noticable issues and I regularily swap between characters -
and servers even to compare bazaar prices between Stormhammer and Tunare.

I have had only 2 lockups since I resubscribed - both times after waking up
and moving my bazaar trader for the first time in the morning after about
10hours on inactivity.

I have no custom UI or anything but of the biggest note is I only have the
expansions up to Shadows of Luclin. No PoP, LoY or LDoN.
