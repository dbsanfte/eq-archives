Has anyone seen an ATM in all or Norrath? Sometimes it can be a pain to run
ALL the way to a bank.
Course if they put in ATM's they'd prob start charging to use it. And don't
even get me started on the PIN# issue.

It's good to know that coins actually weigh something. I suspected as much,
but never actually tested it out.
I know I'm not the one that asked the question, but I found it a helpful
question and answers.
