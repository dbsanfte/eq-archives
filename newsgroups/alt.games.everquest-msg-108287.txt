There is an Orc Pick quest in E FP. I would not do any belt quests,
too much work spreading them out. DF orcs are fair game, but if you
want to return to Neriak, don't fool with CB orcs. Orcs in N Ro are
great, Do dervs if you want.

One person that will sell to you is Murissa Sandwhisper in N Ro. If
you kill Dervs though she will hate you.

BTW, stay away from the bars. Some people in there hate DEs. Lady Shae
and Jyle Windshot in WFP and that stupid Ogre in the EFP dock bar will
KoS.

I have yet to hit Qeynos to see how KoS a non-inny DE cons there. I
suspect I will have to test Novashine's patence and peaceful ways and
hand him a load of bone chips.
