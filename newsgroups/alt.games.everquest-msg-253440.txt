That was originally what /consent was for, yes.

I'm sure it was a CS nightmare.  I know the public channels were constantly
full of "XX found my corpse in the dungeon and I couldn't get to it, so I
consented him and he stole my patchwork and put me on ignore."


And acutally /corpse wasn't really meant to institute corpse dragging.   It
was just meant to be a fix for corpses that fell inside dungeon walls, where
they weren't visible.  Type /corpse and it pulls it out of the wall and
places it at your feet.   It was the players that quickly learned the
command could be repeated over and over again.
