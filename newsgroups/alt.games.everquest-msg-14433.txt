I was in a courtroom listening to a convicted man explain to a judge that he
didn't feel he should be sent to prison for selling cocaine because for the
past two and a half years, he barely made any money at it.


When the Judge asked. "Well then tell me, sir, how much money did you make
off selling cocaine for the last two and a half years?"

The look on the convicts face was PRICELESS.

BTW he got 6 and half years...
