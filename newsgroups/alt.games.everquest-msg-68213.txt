If you read what he says closely, you will find that he does not want
your hand wraps at all.  When you combine hand wraps, rockhopper
claws, and forged fasteners and succede, you get two HtH weapons
back, and lose your hand wraps forever.  If you fail, you get your hand
wraps back, and must to get more claws and fasteners and try again till
you are successful.

He wants the two claws and your cloak, and returns you two better
claws and a better cloak, then sends you off to do the -next- step which
will make you even better claws.

What you did is fail the tailoring, then turn in your original handwrap.

If you haven't done advanced tailoring or smithing before, the confusion
is natural, you haven't previously seen this "alternate product" message
before.  It is the result of any fail in which not all components are destroyed,

the "alternate product" is really just the undestroyed portion of the
ingredients.

I'm surprised that you didn't see this previously when you attempted
the handwraps... most people fail those the first time or two... and
if they do, the "alternate product" is the pattern.
