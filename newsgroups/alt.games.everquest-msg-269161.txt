I enter my password, it authenticates, I'm connected. However, if i press a
key too rapidly to skip past the advertising, then i will be given an
authentication error and the game quits. The error is unrelated to the issue
and if anything might be deliberately misleading; pay us money AND you read
that advertising, or we won't let you play!

Kind of what they do with DVD's, deliberating disabling the fast forward on
certain sections. I hear they want to do that with TV too, presumably as you
won't be able to tape programs but will have to burn straight to dvd, giving
them more control over your ability to control the programming.
