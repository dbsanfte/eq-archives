Not really.  To believe that homosexuality is wrong is not incorrect, nor is
it not in line with the teachings of Christ.  To condemn the homosexual,
that is wrong.  We are given the right to judge an act, that we may avoid
doing that which is evil.  The right to judge a person does not fall on us.

Except that it has every bit of relevance, both as a historical document,
and as a religious doctrine.  I could just as easily say that you have to
let go of your athieism (agnosticism?), as it really has no relevance.

Loving my neighbor does not mean blindly accepting whatevery they do as
being a "good thing."
