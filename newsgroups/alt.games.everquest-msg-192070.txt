At 31 you have your choice of charming griffawns/ons etc. in North K, (or
chant kiting them) or you can swarm kite the knolls around the spires in
South K if they're not taken.  You could also chant kite aviak avocets in
South K.

Pickup groups in Rathe Mnts perhaps, pickup group in Infected Paw (South K).
Lots of areas close by to fight around at your level.  Get a bind at the
gypsy camp in North Karana, also use them to unload all your crap.

Good luck.
