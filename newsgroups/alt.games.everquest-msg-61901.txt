Wurmy is about the best 1 handed weapon you can get for levels 20-35
or so.  Faster weapons don't really outdamage the wurmy until later
levels when the damage bonus kicks in.  I've done a 161 dmg crip with
a wurmy at level 22, hows that for dmg, and at level 25 hit in the
60's a lot.  And i've tested the drain on stamina with the logging
program.  Running out of stamina means you can't jump, you still swing
the same as long as your stamina is 100+.
