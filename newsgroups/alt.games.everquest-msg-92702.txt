Easy: Have table A contain events (i.e. Spellcasting, Eating, Killing)
with an event-id, have table B contain textmessages with a message-id.

Then you make a table C linking A and B with the 3 columns
event-id, language, message-id

So if an event occurs, the system checks the link-table for the message-id
under the current language, then looks up that message in the message-table.

Confuse event-id's and message-id's and you have some effect like you see it
now, including messages in other languages (which is the case in DAoC at the
moment), but since Everquest does not yet support multiple languages for
the client interface, it would just mess up the messages.

Same goes for faction-id's / faction-names and the like.

It's probably some other error, but for me it's kinda easy to imagine
at least one simple explanation for every bug I see.
