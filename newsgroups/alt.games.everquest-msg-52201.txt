Ignoring caster classes who want int/wis on their rings, and are not
accomidated by this one....name for me ONE ring that is even remotely easy
to find, and as effective. The selection of non-ubergame rings in EQ is,

time it takes you to do THAT quest, you could get the cash to buy a half
dozen velium fire opals.
