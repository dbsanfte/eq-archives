No, when quadkiting, the mobs are moving, even snared, they will move 
outside the rain before being hit by all waves.  Regardless, waves don't 
work that way, they do damage up to four times total, could be one wave 
one each of four mobs, or 2 waves on 2 mobs, etc.  For a wizard, the 
pillar spells are far more mana efficient, and more likely to actually 
land on the mobs, as rain type spells seem to have an extra resist over 
and above other types of spells.
