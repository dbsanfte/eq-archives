The results you're looking for would make "any decent testing"
quite expensive.  Which would result in a higher fee.  Which
would likely result in account cancellations.  Which would
likely result in either reduced testing or a still higher fee.
There is no way they're gonna simulate the load the actual
players put on the system/ruleset.  Even if they invited "real"
players to help test, the most likely result would be that when
these players found bugs that were exploitable in non-obvious
ways, instead of reporting them they'd pass them along to a few
choice friends to take advantage of in the days following release.
In fact, given what I've seen and heard in-game and in this group
I would expect that an overwhelming majority of the testers would
be searching for an edge, and too damned busy doing that to try
to find the bugs that they're supposed to be after.  I'll go a
step further, now that my natural cynicism has gotten up a head
of steam, and speculate that that is what has in fact been going
on for the last three years, and SOE is well aware of it, and
that is why the PoP testing was a totally closed affair.  After
the way things went with Kunark and Luclin (can't recall what it
was like when Velious came out, I may have been not playing for
awhile at the time of release), I am amazed at how smooth the PoP
release has been.

SOE/Verant have done their share of stupid things over the last
few years, there is no doubt about that.  But the players have
behaved in a manner befitting the unwashed mob they are, which
is to say with far, far more stupidity and short-sighted greed,
all the while whining about how unfair and incompetent SOE/VI
is without a fucking clue as to what would be fair or competent.
