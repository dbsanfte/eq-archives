The best and fastest exp for your level is probably in Overthere.  Just two
tips: 1) If you see a dragoon or know for sure one is somewhere near you
RUN.  Tip 2) DO NOT HUNT AT THE MOUTH OF THE VALLEY AT FRONTIER MOUNTAIN
ZONE.  You will die there from time to time from goons wandering there and
from people training goons past there.  Zone in, walk down the valley high
on the side and find a group to the left or right of the valley mouth.  The
mouth of the valley is also known as the shallow end of the gene pool.
Don't hang around there.

Luclin may have some better zones, but pre-Luclin, Overthere is the best I
know of for your level.
