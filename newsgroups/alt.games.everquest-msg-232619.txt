If you aren't into tanking, don't get the Copper Hammer as a primary weapon.
The procc has an aggro-generation component.  I watched a 60 ranger pull
aggro off a 65 paladin last night through a whole LDON, jolting two to four
times per pull as the mob spun and spun again.  (And yes, the paladin was
well geared, well equipped, and stunning.)  Finally the cleric spoke up and
the ranger bagged the Hammer; pingpong ceased.

I recommend an Elite Steelslave Stoneblade (or something similar to that, I
forget the exact verbage).  Same ratio, good stats, and no annoying procc.
They sell in the Bazaar in Xegony for 1k on average - I bought one for my
baby ranger.
