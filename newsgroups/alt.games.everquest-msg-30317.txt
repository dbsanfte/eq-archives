Dear God!  Will wonders never cease?  An Englishman who admits the England
is part of Europe.

And just what is wrong with being sexually immoral?  Much better than being
sexually repressed, as the British people are, in general.  What do you
think the real reason for the revolution was?  If you say "taxation without
representation", you'd be only partially correct.  The real reasons are that
we did NOT want to use the word Roger and we knew that it was a far superior
idea to drive on the right (with our controls on the left).

Oh, and to mention Springer when the number one show in Britain (OK, this
was a while ago) was on dog-training, where the host berrated the dogs'
owners more than she helped teach the dogs... Well, give me Springer over
"Walkies!", any day.
