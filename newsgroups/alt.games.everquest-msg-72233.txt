elevation doesn't matter. I've had mobs beating on me, manage to
channel a bolt (cinder bolt), and have it double it.  Had the second
bolt "bath a corpse in fire" and not do any damage if first hit kills
it.

Had first attack resisted, and second land for full, at point blank.

I've tried everything to "force" douible hits.  Downloading stuff in
background to induce lag, running forward as bolt goes out. standing
above mob. sitting down while bolt goes. Backing up after fire bolt. 

however, ever since Luclin came out, you will get the message, "a
sonic wolf whatever is bathed in fire" twice, but will onyl do damage
once. SOMETIMES. sometimes will hit twice, as normal.

One thing that will do it more often than not is to have a cleric or
ranger or someone fear the mob as your bolt is going. if bolt land at
same time will almost always hit for twice.

I've yet to see a triple hit, but heard it can.
