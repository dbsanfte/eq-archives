You read wrong.  The higher of WIS or INT is used to determine the chances
of a skillup in tradeskills.  Some tradeskills have an alternate stat that
they can use, such as STR for smithing, in which case, it is the highest of
WIS, INT, alt stat.  Being an Enchanter, naturally, INT would be the way to
go for you for tradeskills, but, for WIS casters, that is not usually the
best approach, WIS is usually easier for them.
