The last few days I've played in a few LDoN pickup groups. When the 
leader asked the group what type of mission they wanted, I've been very 
surprised by the fact that the vast majority of people have been firmly 
against assassinations. Honestly, the regular assassination adventure has 
never given any of my groups any trouble. What's up with that?

For the record, the only adventure type I prefer to avoid is rescue. I've 
heard about the trouble people sometimes have getting the victim to 
follow them out due to pathing issues and such. Since the other types are 
easy enough, why bother, right?

That said, I've found the easiest by far right now to be the collect 
missions. Playing my bard, I often miss stuff scrolling through the chat 
window (gotta get my TacticalBoard set up again), we've gotten about 
halfway through the time limit on my last couple of missions when I hit 
ALT+V to check our status only to see we've already completed it and were 
on our last 30 minutes. I was surprised to see that I had missed the 
message that pops up in the middle of the screen though. Is that still 
working correctly?

On a side note, I almost bailed on my last group before we ever grabbed 
an adventure. I joined as the sixth member of the group, and one of the 
existing members went LD. The leader filled their spot within 10-15 
seconds. At first I though that was a crappy thing to do, but in 
hindsight, there may have been more to the story. Also, considering the 
way it often works, the leader may have done the smartest thing possibly 
avoiding waiting around for the LD member to never come back.

Anywho, I'm still having a blast with this expansion. :)
