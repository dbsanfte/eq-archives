I was outside Kaladim and someone (I wrote the name and guild down if
anyone is interested) inspected my equipment, then asked to "see" all my
stuff.  gritting my teeth, I placed an item on him to invoke the trade
window, then waited.  then he told me to hit the trade button.  gack.  I
refused, but then he wanted to see other stuff.  being a newbie I
reluctantly followed along, but never hit the trade button.  He put a
very nice piece of armor out and asked me to trade again, but I got
quite confused.  My first instinct was that he was trying to scam me out
of stuff.  in retrospect, I wonder if this is an established trading
game where you put about increasingly good stuff one at a time, trading
off player to player, but the guy that chickens out and COMPLETES the
trade is the.... loser?  winner?  ///

seems like it would be like a cross between playing chicken and russian
roulette.  Am I right, or was someone trying to scam me?

thanks in advance for any help.

P.S. I remained polite the whole time because I think that that is
important, especially when on unfamiliar turf.
