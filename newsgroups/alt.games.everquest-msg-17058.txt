About 2 month ago I aksed for help here how to proceed with my
Paladin - I couldnt get more exp in the Qeynos-area.
I was lvl 16 at that time.
I got a lot of nice answers and went to Oasis until about 22 and then
to Unrest.
Now Im lvl 30 and exp get slow there so I moved to Highkeep,
(one of the nice peoble told hes lvl from 30 - 39 in a week there)
but Im not sure, if its the right place for me.

Yesterday I grouped with some peoble in Basement but what
happend was, that several times our spawns was taken by pullers
from some of the other groups there. They didnt care - just said, that
we might have camped the room, but they were first to pull...huh!
Peoble were shouting F... you! and so on to each other - Im 39 in rl
and find that a bit boring, and Im playing Everquest to have a good time.

Im also a bit tired of hunting indoors, so: 
If there another good zone for me to go please? I was thinking of  
The Overthere or Lake of Ill Omen. Are there any high lvl undeads
in these zones. Can I solo there?
Or is there any other good zones for my lvl and class?

Nice peoble in this group - I need some advice again please.
