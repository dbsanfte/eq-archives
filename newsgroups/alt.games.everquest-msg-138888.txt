The crazed goblins in Butcherblock seem made to order for skilling up.  Dark
blue at 35th , easy to single pull,  not often camped and no casters to deal
with.  At 35th level you should have little problem dealing with them and
since they don't do a great deal of damage when they hit you can get attack
and defense boosts pretty quickly and fight mostly with your weapon of
choice and then just nuke 'em down before you get hurt too bad.  The loot
isn't too bad either with an average of about 3pp a kill.  There are three
spawns on about a ten minute timer so plenty of time to med up before the
next one so there's little risk of dying solo.  Not bad for skilling up solo
but very dull with a group or for pure xp.
