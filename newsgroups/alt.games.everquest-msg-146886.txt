Not saying this ONE event didn't happen, but I just find it amusing that you
first made the mistake of making a generalization based off of one incident
(or maybe even a few in your memory) and then misstated the very incident.
This isn't out of some defense against some hobbit character I have.
Honestly don't have any, as fast as they level, the noise they make when
they get hit annoys me.

Point of Fact:  There are a lot of beggars in the game.

Point of Fact: Because of their cuteness or leveling speed or whatever,
there are a lot of halflings in the game.

When these two facts get mixed....

Point of Generalization:  Most beggars are Halflings

This is just a generalization created by mistaken perception on your part.
If you want to actually prove yourself right or wrong, start keeping a list
of all the people that you see begging in a zone by class and race.  And
then (and this would be difficult) keep a tally of all the race/classes you
see in the game in general.  Find out of these two percentages cross over.
Probably will.  20% of the characters playing are halfling, 20% of beggars
are halflings, that sort of thing.

And why the hell did you give the beggar a shield in the first place?
You're just feeding the tendancy.  If NOBODY ever gave a beggar even a piece
of copper, begging would be fruitless and I would hope that it would go
down.  All this time I thought beggars were just wasting there time, but hey
you gave one something, so maybe there is something to get out of begging.

Don't Feed the Beggars!
