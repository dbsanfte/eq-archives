Do you see drops with available augment slots from PoT as 'gimped' as well??

What's that supposed to mean? In EQ pretty much the only way you get 
'ripped off' is if you fail to read whats in the trade window.

Already in EQ crafters can make tons of stuff they can't actually use. 
I've never heard them complain much about it. What's the difference?

Think more along the augment line. You put an extended battery clip, 
upgraded cooling module and a scope on the dropped pistol... all crafted.

Most of EQ is a virtual job, from farming to raiding. Monotony and 
tedium are the rule of the day. If *anybody* is truly satisfied with EQs 
systems they should be examined?

Play quake team arena. They already wrote that game 1000 different ways. =)

There's room in the market for more than one style of game. All things 
considered 20% of the mmog market plays SWG...Evidently 2 in 10 people 
happen to prefer 'souless compendiums of game design theories' above 
everything else in the market... who am I to judge.
