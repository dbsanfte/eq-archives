Even though my reply only loosely applies to your question, an observation
on monk partners from experience:

Monk+Druid (around same level)

Very good partnership.  When things look like they are taking a turn for the
worse, the druid snares, runs, and the monk FD's.  In most instances, this
does not happen, as the duo is very capable of "taking care of business".

Monk+Ranger

If the mobs do not drop fairly fast, this one can spell trouble.  The ranger
does not have any really good escape mechanisms like the druid's
snare+spirit of cheetah, however, if you are working single and double-pull
blues in the 30's, you should have no major problems.

Monk+Cleric

Overkill on the heals but a definate STRONG combo -- kind of a weaker
version of a cleric and warrior tagging reds.

Monk+Warrior (WAR dual, taunt)

Unholy damage.  Frightening.  Shocking.  Then you rest.  And rest.  And
rest.  Did I say rest?
