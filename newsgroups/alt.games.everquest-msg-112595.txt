Yeah, those are EXTREME prelimnary models. The human in this picture
looks like some stock 3ds model:

Do you know what kicks ALL ASS though? That is a protection spell.
They mentioned this is the way EQ2 will be. If a player casts a
protection of bones spell, HE WILL HAVE A CAGE OF BONES AROUND HIM! I
think that is pretty kick ass. The same thing goes for thorns and
such. I'm certain, since in time it might be clumbersome to be around
30 players with big bone cages around them, you'll be able to toggle
those effects off.

Artists can, as with luclin, make character models like 6 months
before release in nothing flat. The stuff they are working on now is
much more likely to be game engine, npc AI, game world
graphics/textures, modes of travel, npc scripting, etc.
