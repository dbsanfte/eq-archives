Actually, the coldain wolves won't KOS you in wolf form, its just that
your faction to Coldain is worse in wolf form than in your natural
form... but if you get faction up with coldain a few steps you'll no
longer be KOS even in wolf form.

Similarly, its possible to get giant faction up (Kromzek or Kromriff,
whichever is Frost Giant faction) enough to walk around blithely past
Drakkal Wolves as well as the giants themselves.

My bard has made a point of being dubious to both giants and coldain, so
that he can walk without worry thru either city (well, much of Kael,
anyway) and large swaths of EW and GD.

Point is, these mobs, despite looking like wolves, are not on "wolf"
faction.  If there is such a thing as "wolf faction" it appears to have
no quests or mobs you can kill that will raise or lower it in any way;
certain races and classes are not KOS, most are, and thats that; same is
true of most bears and cats.
