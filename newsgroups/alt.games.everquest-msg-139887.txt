No, the person who Does the most damage gets the Kill and also gets looting
rights, the last hit matters not.
In the case of a Mem blur effect the Mob's hate list is cleared, as far as
it (the mob) is concerned no one has hit it, even tho it can be down to next
to no health and doing the death walk. This is when the power levelee gets
to take the kill, exp and loot. It is the equivalent of the Cleric/Enchanter
leaving the zone.
FD should work similar but I understand that has limitations, in totally
clearing hate list, at higher level.
