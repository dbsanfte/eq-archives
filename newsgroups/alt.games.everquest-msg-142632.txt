Late reply here, but I've been seeing this bounced around the forums a
lot lately, so I have to ask...

Why would a druid want the snare component of the effect REMOVED?  I
don't know anything about the epic, and very little about druids for
that matter.  But I can't see anything wrong with having a mana free
snare.  Even if it has a short duration, it may give a druid some
additional time to get off a better snare, or perhaps one last chance
to get away when oom.

There has got to be some logical explanation, since a lot of people
are making these sorts of comments.  Plus, I think (?) they have
addressed it on test and it may move to live.

Given the new druid 'CH', maybe we clerics could ask Verant to migrate
this druid epic snare effect to the cleric epic somehow, but only make
it 75% as effective (hehe, just kidding!)
