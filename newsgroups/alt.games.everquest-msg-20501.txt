Heh, that's my sister's name IRL.  My parents had never read Dune.  Nor 
did they know of the princess of Jordan with that name until she died in a 
helicopter crash shortly after my sister's birth.  And they certainly 
didn't know about the European airline company with that name...

Making sure your creativity's original is a bitch. :)
