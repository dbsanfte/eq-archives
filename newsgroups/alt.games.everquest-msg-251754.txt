Depends who you are and what you are doing.

A higher level player with a fast pc, and run speed 3, in Everfrost, or 
Deepest Guk... its probably a non-issue.

A 45th level cleric at normal run speed with an older pc can take up to 
10 minutes to get from Butcherblock to Mistmoore, or from EC to Oasis.
