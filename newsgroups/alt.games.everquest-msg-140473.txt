Another solution is to recast it before it wears off. My greatest
problem with the epic snare is that my spells sometimes wear off two
or three at a time (and I'd really love to know what causes that - no,
I do not time my casting so they all wear off at the exact same 1/10
of a second; in fact, that's impossible) and that there's a fair
chance two of those spells will be root and epic. 
My first solo attempt on captain Diouz in Chardok ended with me
running for the zone when he broke all three spells I had on him
simultaneously and I didn't have room to repark the stunning s.o.b.
Since he wasn't snared anymore, he limped back to his spawnpoint after
I zoned and became someone else's easy kill at 10% life. My second
attempt ended with him dead and never touching me, which was a good
thing as he was holding a 11/20 hammer.

I've grown used to it. Recast often enough and it's pretty safe - the
random instantaneous breaks seem to only happen to spells due to wear
off within the next few ticks anyway. I've also found it to be useful
for keeping a mob's attention - if I pull something from Chardok zone
in to the zone out tunnel where I prefer sitting, a snared mob will be
distracted by any people it sees sitting in front of the fort, while
an epic snared mob will ignore them completely.

I virtually always have snare memmed, and I still use it, but unless
in an exp group, it's only to make sure something I really don't want
unsnared (like velium hounds) stays slow while I cast epic.
