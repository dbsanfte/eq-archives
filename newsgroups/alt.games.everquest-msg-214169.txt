Had not noticed that problem, but, I have found that I have lots of 
trouble targetting using the F keys.  F8 for mob rarely works anymore, 
even in a flat room with one mob in it, often, I will get nothing 
targeted.  I've also had trouble targetting party members using F2 to F6.  
It's really sucked.
