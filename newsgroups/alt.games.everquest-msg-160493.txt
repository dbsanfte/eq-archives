I believe the original post said "lots of groups".  That leaves HK out.  Ah,
lets see, as I remember; Lookout, Guard, Warrior, Raider rooms.  4 rooms = 3
groups....  a large group usually tries to take the warrior room, hall spans
and raider room!  Oh yea, I played my main and 3 alts there form around
26/27 to about 32/33 and was out in a week or less BUT (and its a big but) I
always played ever early in the am... like 5am and had at least one RL
friend playing with me at that time of day.  Oh yea, and at lower levels
threes the joy of the idiots (usually 2 or 3 29 to 33's trying to hold the
raider room and hall spans) bring the trains up for your enjoyment.

The loots Ok at best too...  you won't be visiting Bazaar very often on HK
loot, unless ones the loot pig of the decade and plays with splits off.  AND
its not as bad as it use to be either!  With my main I can remember as many
as 30 or more peeps sitting waiting to be called to a group during peak
times at night for hours!  No, Fennin Ro isn't in the top 10 busiest servers
either, although there use to be a lot more players 2 years ago.

I haven't played a mid/upper 20's character in awhile now (have and a 22
Claric and 38 Mage sitting for a long time now waiting) but if I ever return
to the Claric I'll stay on Luclin until early 30's probably.  At least
that's what I've head peeps are doing now adays.
