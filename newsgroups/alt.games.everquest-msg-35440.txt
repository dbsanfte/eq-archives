Hi i'm 31 and has played for 2 months maybe three, my main is lvl 19
dark elf necromancer on luclin, have played him for a while, not shure
how long though, never tried to gain levels in a rapid pace, sometimes
i just stay in the newbie area and heal and buff lowbies, gives no xp
but makes you feel good :)

and ontop of this i have 30 other guys, ranging from lvl 1 to lvl 10,
and i also have a lvl 1 agent in Anarchy online :)

/Regards Berth (Thotamon lvl 19 DE necro luclin)
