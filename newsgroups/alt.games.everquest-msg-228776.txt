Here's mine....

Bumming around in PoK trying to talk the guild into a XP group.... not
succeeding (Most were in LDON)....

Get an OOC "Paying 200pp for two rezzes in WL - will provide transport there
and back - PST".
I send 'em a tell and we group and port out...  They retrieve the corpses I
give them their 96% rezzes - buff 'em to the best of my ability....
Temperance, death pact etc etc....

We port back to PoK, Then I get handed 136pp.  I gratefully accept but am
left stymied thinking that it's still 64pp short of their initial offer.

Surely if you're going to advertise in an OOC like that clearly offering to
pay 200pp for a cleric's services then shouldn't they honour it?  Methinks
they should.  Sure, I'm up about 100pp after dot and pearl expenses and I'm
sure that's what they were relying on so that I didn't kick up a stink in
OOC.  Still an offer of 200pp is an offer of 200pp!!

Now to others like this out there.....

Most clerics (on Drinal anyway - myself included) that are not otherwise
occupied don't charge anything for rezzes and requests for temperance (for
the cost of the peridot) are gladly given but if you're going to make an
offer of 200pp then bloody well honour it!!!

There, that's my pet peeve for the moment.

Tuvarilo (57 cleric of Drinal)
