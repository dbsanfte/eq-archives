::cackle:: Pretty.

I vote for silver chitin hand wraps.  I dunno what server you're on,
EMarr I've seen em go for 3.5k often.  With the other money - a couple
good piercers.  I like the shaded dagger Mark Rimer gave me.  Tried a
jagged ice shard off-hand for awhile, which was supposed to be
oh-so-good, wasn't overly impressed.  Maybe go for a centi shortsword
until you can afford a centi longsword (css - 275 or so, lss, well
over 2k still).  Armor, I dunno - I've had to settle for less in a lot
of areas to try and get my sta up :/
