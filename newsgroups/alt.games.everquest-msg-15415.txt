It is also written OR spoken.  And I entirely disagree with your second 
statement.  There are many things I can pronounce that are not a valid 
part of the language, and many things I cannot, that are.

Consider the word zantlewerdle.  It is simple to pronounce.  It is also, 
in fact, a word.  It is not an English word, or a word in any other 
language I'm aware of.  But it is still a word.  Just like acronyms are, 
despite the fact you can't pronounce them.

Note that the definition about a word being a unit of language did not say 
it had to be a valid unit of language, either.

Otherwise, the expression 'a misspelled word' would be meaningless.
