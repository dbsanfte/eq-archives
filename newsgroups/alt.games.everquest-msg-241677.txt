If you need a different reason to avoid WoW, take a look at their
official forums. Every twelve year old battlenet brat is in there
making a nuisance of themself.

That is the playerbase WoW is drawing on, and it makes the dewds of EQ
look like graduates of a 19th century finishing school....

That said I'll probably still give it a try. Maybe they'll have
infinite /ignore space....
