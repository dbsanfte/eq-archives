My Iksar Shaman has the best possible faction w/ elves and dwarves as I
spent level 4 thru 16ish in CB killing LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of orcs.  This
was way back in the day when Gfay used to be the /auction zone on Xegony
therefore there was an advantage to actually hunting in CB.  Now, I really
can't think of a good reason to try to raise your faction superhigh w/ the
elves since you really don't need to ever go near them.
