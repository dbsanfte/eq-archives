Bah. I would say all but a very few ninja-looters I have come across
will continue to do so only until someone breaks down and jumps there
butt for it. Then they act all apologetic and repentant. Screw them.
They knew they were taking well more than their own share without so
much as a word to anyone else. If I'm the group leader, they get the
boot. I shouldn't have to tell someone to display common courtesy to
their group mates. If I'm not the group leader, I ask the group leader
to please choose between the NL and me - one of us must go. No hard
feelings if they choose the NL, I just go on my way. I will not group
with a NL, whether they are allegedly interested in making amends or
not. At that point I've seen plenty into the type of person they
really are.

Btw, I am consider a NL to be someone who jumps on every corpse they
can get to first and/or demonstrates a blatant disregard for anyone
else getting a fair share. At that point, there is little room for
debate as to whether they fall into that category or not.
