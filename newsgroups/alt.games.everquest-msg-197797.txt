It is an extremely time consuming thing to do, equipping someone with uber 
gear.  It is not something most family type guilds are up to doing, it just 
is not the right environment.  You need to serious amounts of raiding high 
end places.  I am in a family and friends type guild, and we have noone 
that is in the really high end gear, as we are not capable of raiding the 
places necessary to obtain it.  Most of the really high end stuff is 
nodrop, with any number of exceptions, but most of it.  This means that in 
order to obtain it, you have to be there, you have to defeat the mobs in 
question, and, in many cases, you have to spend endless tedious weeks 
farming for parts to get keys to get into the high end places.  We had one 
level 65 ranger in the guild with some high end gear, which he obtained 
while he belonged to a raiding guild.  In order to do that, he had to farm 
for parts for keys.  He had to raise tradeskills in order to make nodrop 
weapons used in one encounter, again, to gain access to one zone.  This all  
occurred prior to PoP.

How many family and friends type guilds are up to this?

I believe it was stated elsewhere how he obtained his equipment, spending a 
year attending public raids.  Not, spending time attending guild raids.
