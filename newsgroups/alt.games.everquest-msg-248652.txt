But that's exactly what the much-maligned "fast travel" systems (PoK,
wayfarer camps, etc.) are good for!  It used to be that people would
go to some level-appropriate place that took a while to reach (e.g.,
Splitpaw), get bound nearby, and then stay there for several levels.
This worked because there were always enough other people there to
group with.  As content expanded, people had more places they could
go, so you couldn't be sure of finding a group in some places.  But
with the new transport systems, that shouldn't be a problem.  Find
your group wherever people gather (e.g. PoK) and then go wherever
you feel like hunting that day.

But no, most people just go to one of a fairly short list of places
at any given level.  Granted, some places are harder to reach than
they might be (Splitpaw, again, since the Nexus spires to NK are a
bit slow compared to other forms of travel), but it doesn't take THAT
long to get most places now, and travelling gives you time to talk
to your groupmates (what a concept!).

I do do a lot of soloing, but once a week I try to link up with a
friend who's a couple levels above me, and each week we've gone
somewhere new.  Overthere, Dawnshroud, Frontier Mts, and last night
it was Great Divide.  Two people is a lot less lonely than one, and
we often find 1-2 other folks LFG.  But even with two we can chew
through blue mobs like butter and handle the occasional yellow or
low red when we want more excitement. :)
