It's a very good zone, isn't it!  You hit the nail on the head I think
the dozens of players in there last night - yes, very likely served
their time in HHK.  I mean, fancy blithely wandering in there at level
20, on the strength of that message popping up, then the group taking
on a dark blue that shreds you all... extremely traumatic.  There was
more corpse-dragging going on than fighting, lol.
