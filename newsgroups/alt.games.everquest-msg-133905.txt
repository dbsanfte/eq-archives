If true it is just another classic example of TR's complete and utter
arrogant obnoxiousness which is why so many people despise them in the first
place. The calender system is actually a surpisingly fair system which
stymies jerkish guild behaviour and allows guilds to plan ahead raids (to a
level of which they have been tested to handle).

Of course there are guilds who chaff under it's constraints, and the more
jerkish the guild wants to be then the more contrained they will feel
naturally.

Even if not true, the following part of their letter pretty well displays
their attitude anyway:

Notice

Given the current environment on the Stormhammer server, the bias
demonstrated by the staff, and our inability to amicably resolve these
issues through the normal customer service process, SOE is hereby placed on
notice that Township Rebellion henceforth withdraws and no longer recognizes
as legitimate, the calendar system forced upon the Stormhammer players. As
of July 24th, 2002 Township Rebellion will return to the "free-for-all" play
style found on nearly every other Everquest server.
