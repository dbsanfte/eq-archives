Very true, 2k on a twink is a bit much eventhough I have that available to
spend.  I dont need to be completely outfitted to play/enjoy a character.
My cleric was like 30 before I had over 150 WIS.  I perfer to wait around
and look for good deals (Got Othmir Fur Caps for 40pp a pop x5) and quest
items instead of buying everything at once and dumping it on him; auction
channels have helped with this and I park my main in FP while 2 boxing my
cleric.  Anytime I get some decent loot for a specific class I put it on
that character, so I dont sell much of my gear (I have 2 druids, monk,
cleric, ranger, chanter, shammy, bard, wizzy, beastlord, and mage).

The ranger is lvl 6 now and I am not interested in PLing him to 50's in a
hurry, since I cannot play for long periods of time I enjoy the lower to mid
levels of the game where I can see my exp bar move more often then the need
for a full group where I cant commit to 2+ hours at a time, and the reason
why I play 2 accounts so I can play with myself =P (no pun intended )
