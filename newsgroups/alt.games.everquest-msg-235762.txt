Hey!  I resent that!  A mere moron would hardly have thought to
refer back to Sean's helpful hints to Annie in the "Watch him die"
thread.  I would say my performance qualifies as highgrade idiot
at the very least.  Perhaps if I'd followed 42's suggestion and
refered to you as a mouth-breather also I could have managed a
coveted sub-normal rating.

Well, I am willing to agree that _your_ posts were moronic, does
that help you feel better?

> You: I WIN! NEENER NEENER!

Now there you go again, always ready to make assumptions and attribute
your own shortcomings to other posters.  Good ol' DT.  Thanks again
bud!  It's nice to know that some things just never change.
