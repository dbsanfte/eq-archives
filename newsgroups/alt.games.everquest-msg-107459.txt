I have not been there as this poster has,
but hear itt is a lot more empty than other servers. There is,
however, at least one level 60 hardcore raiding guild  there. You must
be 60 to be in it and I think having your epic would be a bonus to
them (so they don't have to bother) Another requirement/brownie point
might be a sleepers tomb key as they raid that often. From what my
friend was saying they hit the big stuff pretty fast several times a
day. I forget the name of that guild.

In other words, apart from lower numbers and some gm quests/unique
loot and that zone not availible yet on regular servers, this is the
same as any server. A main reason to go might be being bored on your
server and wanting to go to a new one complete with all your
equipment. I'm thinking of trying Legends before quitting EQ some
year, if even for a month.
