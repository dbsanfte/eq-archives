I'm a level 30 druid, and this is my highest character.  As such, I
don't have the greatest AC.  When in groups and more than one mob is
pulled, if I heal I tend to get jumped on.   If this happens in a
dungeon, I die.

So, if there are 2 mobs, I can usually wait until the first one is
dead before I have to heal.  Or, if there is an enchanter I wait until
all but one are mezzed and wait until I truly must heal.  

What I want to know is, if in a group there is no enchanter and more
than 2 are pulled, should I just say we must run for it (evac,
whatever)?   I am interested in hearing of the experiences of primary
healers.  It doesn't really matter if there is another player with
healing capabilities in the group because I go down fast (they are
typically a younger level with a lesser heal anyway), and the meleers
hardly ever try or succeed in pulling them off of me.  I dislike being
the primary healer because this has been the cause of most of my
deaths.  However, if I want to play in dungeons, I probably have to
take that role.
