Ahhh, I see.

Exactly how much territory does he have? Are there no other cats around?

Alternative, sure. I guess sticking your head in the sand about causing 
other people needless hassle and animals needless pain is an alternative.

Yes, I do.

Firebelly newts do not breed except in the "season". The home herpetologist 
has to stimulate this by feeding large quantities of live food and 
fluxuating the temperature drastically over a few weeks.

The frogs were a non issue- I had one of one species(well, a toad, really) 
and three dwarf aquatic frogs, which do not breed well or easily in 
captivity.

The birds actually did breed. We traded the chicks back to our favorite pet 
store for credit for supplies. 

The snakes- 2 ball pythons (both male), and one female redtail boa.  

Various fish bred various amounts- many died out(in the wild in some 
species a 5% survival rate is considered high). Most of these we kept, some 
we sold back to the pet store or traded with other aquarists. 

The difference here is that my fish did not go swimming around the 
neighborhood impregnating other peoples fish, nor were they allowed to 
breed unchecked in natural bodies of water where they had no business 
being.

Yes, this is obviously my ego, and not time-honored social pragmas that 
have been around far longer than you have been on the internet.

I am condensing the "rabies" post here.

Unnecessary? Feline leukemia shots *unnecessary*? Faned, you really are 
as fucking clueless as you are arrogant. Feline leukemia(which claims feral 
cats as it's highest transmission vector) is VERY easy for a cat to catch. 
The cat can catch it from the environment that an infected cat has occupied 
or passed through. As for rabies, it can be transmitted to and from any 
mammal. For example, the rat your cat caught that got off one lucky bite 
before it's demise.

Do you live on a tiny catless island somewhere? How else could you possibly 
know your cat is not at risk? Please tell us all what "proper care" of your 
animals you perform that renders them invulnerable to these disease without 
innoculations.

Then again, if you are once again talking out of your ass and would prefer 
to dodge, I kan mispel sum werds so u kan atak my speling and not my 
argumens.
