Hmm.  And contrariwise, I find the aggro on flame lick highly overrated. 
:)  It's real good aggro up to level 12 or so, but then it starts tapering 
off.  The real advantage of flame lick is that it casts so quickly.  
Sometimes, getting that tiny bit of aggro in there -first- makes all the 
difference, and it's awesome to pull with.  But I don't think it generates 
even a quarter the aggro that snare does, much less a ranger's DPS.

I'm open to evidence to the contrary, though. :)
