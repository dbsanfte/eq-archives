I certainly can't land spells on MOBs in the water in PoD. It is
annoying when I'm using a charmed rat to kill larvae as the larvae
slide into the water which means I can no longer keep them rooted and
a broken charm then means I have both the buggers chasing me! I
haven't died yet thanks to Arcane Rune though :)
I guess you must be able to cast spells on other players in water - as
evidenced by the OP.

On the subject of the Ice - I fell through that hole a couple of weeks
ago on the way back from an LDoN adventure. Put EB on myself and then
found the hole again but couldn't climb back out. Tried for several
minutes thrashing around before giving up and gating out. For someone
without EB or Gate this seems to be a barely-visible death trap!

Congrats on the successful completion Winterfury. It's certainly the
close ones which are the most fun!
