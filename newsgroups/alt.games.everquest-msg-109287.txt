? what is to think. Its a go between site so the validity of any
auction is still only based upon you and the person you are doing it
with, not the site. 

I guess if you have the 175 bucks its a hell of a lot easier than
getting 40 k plat in game to buy one. I've never done that sort of
thing but I always wondered, "if I won 300 million in the lottery
would I suddenly just buy any equipment I wanted on a player auction
site?" Maybe I would, who knows. More likely though I'd have better
things to do than play EQ ;)
