Yeah I know sorry I am normally a bottom poster.
I thought i had deleted the text.
Didn't realize that it was there untill i posted it.
I hadn't realized that there was not an origional copy on some news servers
as i downloaded it only a couple of days ago off mine.
It was just one of those really quick posts where you don't really pay
attention coz you have to go out the door in about a minuite.
