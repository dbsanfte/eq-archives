The formula for this stats are for the spell casting abilities
level +1 x 5
Offense and Defense is 5 less then the spell casting ablitites
For your 1hb, 1hs, and 2hb
level+1 x 4
To get this up you have to fight a blue or higher mob to raise skill. That
means letting them hit you and you hitting them. Fear is good on animals to
raise your Meddle just run behind them hitting them.

Find a quiet place and target yourself and cast away till you max this out.

Find a quiet pond say in Freeport in the casters guild put on numlock and
just swim
in a circle. You might also consider doing fishing and get that maxed out to
there are quests that need fishing and it is easier to work on them at each
level then to find you need them and spend hours if not days getting them
up. The nice thing about fishing is I can forage the grubs then either hunt
for batwings or buy them and use those and the fish to make fishrolls which
is a baking trade skill. Then you sell back to merchants.
