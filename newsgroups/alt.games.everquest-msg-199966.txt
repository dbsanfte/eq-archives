The easiest and safest way is to go to SharVal and find "A Caged
Rockhopper".  Stand against the wall in the corner as far from the
guard as you can get (on the side of the fence with the rockhopper).
Play DDD, go to bed, and wake up to find your skill maxed.  There are
no NPC's or mobs that will attack and the zone is usually not busy so
you don't have to worry about going LD like in Nexus.
