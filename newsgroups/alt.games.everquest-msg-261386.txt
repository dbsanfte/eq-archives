Are you talking about conduct of a guild? AFAIK, SoE doesn't mandate
guild conduct. All I've ever heard is that if the guild is not active,
it will delete the guild.

OTOH, a server's population can certainly decide whether a guild
'survives' or not. About a year or so ago, a couple of guilds disbanded
within a few days of being 'blackballed' by the rest of the guilds on
the server I play on.
