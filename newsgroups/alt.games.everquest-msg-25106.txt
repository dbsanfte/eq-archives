Gah! Maybe I should bury him in wis items, give him some fruit and
veggies and force him to skill up on his own? Or I could just force
him to take his chances with a lessthangrand master.

Is there nothing but Faydwer shaker between ginesh and mino brew? I'm
not going to waste morning dews making elven wine for the shaker :)

I actually think I've done the same thing, I think I once right
clicked a drink I looted. This was before I logged everything so the
only way to check would be to drink another bottle :)

LOL!
I think I have the highest tradeskills in my guild. There is one
master potter (I'm staying at 99 till I go for shawl #4) and another
142 skill baker. A guildie recently gave me a stack of brownie parts,
so now I can really be a party caterer :)
