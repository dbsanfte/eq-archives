I'm not a fan of the fact that they show you ahead of time what mobs
are linked or that there isn't any randomness involved but I do like
the idea in general. It leaves a lot more flexibility in how you
design encounters and I've always preferred fighting multiple
(relatively weak) mobs as opposed to the current EQ situation where
they force you to fight one mob at a time in most situations.
