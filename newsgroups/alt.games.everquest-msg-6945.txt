Barbarians are often shaman, as are Ogres.

How often has my DWARF cleric been asked for SOW?  Well, heck
shaman and druids use staffs, right?

/say Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a travel agent!

At least when they ask me for a clarity, there's the off
chance that I'm an enchanter in illusion dwarf, although
I can't for the life of me think what the advantage would
be to that unless its for faction reasons.
