Anyone looked at the current poll on Alakhazam lately?
;-)

Questions is effective, "What do you think of Legends?" with about five
choices of answers.

IIRC, the results after the first four *thousand* responses or so were;

4% actually said they thought it sounded cool and might try it.
A charitable 13% or so said "Who cares? I'm having fun on my server."

The remaining *VAST* majority chose varying degrees of derogator
responses, with nearly HALF picking the one that started with "Those
bastards ..."

LOL. This should go over great.
