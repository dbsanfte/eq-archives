Then you probably should take a history lesson of EQ expansions in
general. All the big ideas get nerfed.

If this was a concern for you, you should have waited until the
fallout subsided.

I mean, everyone who clicked on the tribute guy knew it was going to
be nerfed within seconds of doing so.

Sometimes we don't always get what we want. The tribute bonuses just
aren't that big a deal. They are not instanced zones, they are not a
big transport zone with a ton of stuff in them. If you feel you got
ripped off your thirty clams due to the nerf, then you were going to
feel you got ripped off anyways. The tribute system just ain't all
that.
