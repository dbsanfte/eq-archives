    Yes, by definition this is twinking.

    But, uh... why do you care?

    You earned the equipment with your shaman, right?  It's totally up to
you what you do with it.

    Heck... I have one character.  When he is a Sorcerer, I intend to start
a melee character, probably a warrior.  You cannot begin to imagine, yet,
what I intend to do to/for that warrior.  Heck, right NOW I'd give him
weapons the likes of which he would never earn for several months... a full
suit of banded at level 1 (for example)... +str gear... +sta... +plus ...

    But when I do this in 20 levels or so, people will look at him and say
"My GAWD, you're an effing TWINK!"
    To which I will say, "My big brother and patron deity is a Sorcerer"

    If they know what that means then they won't care.

    And if they're too new to the game to know what that means, then I don't
care what they care about.

    A sufficiently well equipped tank isn't going to have any problem
getting into a group... and I've learned enough about playing the game in my
(38 so far) levels that I'm not going to get anyone else killed because my
warrior got a dividend check from Hostess and I'm too green to know what to
do with that power.

    I like that I've earned what I have... and I have NEVER begged for
equipment nor money.  I've given, sold, destroyed, and traded more equipment
that I can't use than I would need to make a mega-twink out of a low level
warrior.  I play a game... I have ethics... but hey, I've already done the
quests and killed the giants...  I'll probably play the warrior on a second
account so he has a taxi... and I can PL him to about 15 so he can play with
people in groups, and not a bunch of newbies who are still learning the
interface.

    Is it twinking?  Yes.
    Are there people who will feel resentment?  Yes.
    Do I care? No.  If they worked one of their 5 lowbies up to a
respectable level, they'd do the same thing, most likely.  And if not...
that's their choice.
