In good groups, the cleric has mana to keep people healed without slows. As
enchanter (lvl 65) I often just use the 50% tepid deeds to slow, since it
casts much faster, and its very cheap on the mana.
Another spell to consider is the cripple line. This decreases the mobs armor
class, and will increase your kill rate. It also casts pretty fast.

If they replaced you with a dps, and had no shaman buffs, then I doubt they
would be killing any faster. Therefore your carrying your weight.
