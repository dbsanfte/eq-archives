Won't work. To spawn Rage, you need the Box of Binding in which to
combine the four pearlescent fragments. You have to do the pearl
turn-in to Zordak in SolB to get the Box of Binding. Note that
Warder Cecilia won't give you a box until you've turned the pearl
in to Zordak: she will say "you're not the one I seek" or something
like that. And you have to get both Ixi's Scepter and Overking's
Singed Scroll to get the pearl to turn in to Zordak.

Thus you have to do {Ixi, Overking} in either order, then the SolB
Zordak camp, then combine the fragments in the Box for spawning Rage.

Good luck,
