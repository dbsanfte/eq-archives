Yes, out of the necessity of mathematics, you will lose some (miniscule)
amount of exp with it split.

That is, of course, assuming that you don't gain free exp for the same
mathematical reasons.  But knowing Sony, that is unlikely, as they would be
sure to round down instead of up in the formulas for that very reason.

What is 50% of 3 exp?
