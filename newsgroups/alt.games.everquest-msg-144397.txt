Finally saw both movies.  Only problem I have is all the goodies they 
are talking about are totally out of reach by my system.  No way can I 
afford yet another graphics card and another computer so I can play 
that.  I can barely play EQ as it is, had to turn off all the new models 
I bought Luclin to get ::pout::  Anyway, I probably won't be able to get 
EQ2 at all.
