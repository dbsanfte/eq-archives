Betrayed?  That's an interesting way to look at it.  You feel Commodore
Business Machines should have supplied a Commodore 64 emulator for free
on the Amiga?

The Macintosh was superior in some ways, and inferior in some ways...

In my opinion, Linux is heavily weighed down by its business-unfriendly
license.  That'll always limit its potential.

The primary reason to hate Windows is because it's owned by Microsoft,
who regularly and predictably shows no remorse at abusing its monopoly
position over and over.  We (you and I included) all end up losing...

Nonetheless, I too use Windows.  It's one of those things I do, but I'm
not proud of it.

Transfer it to CR-R?  :)

Yeah, getting too far off-topic.  I'll leave it at this.  :)
