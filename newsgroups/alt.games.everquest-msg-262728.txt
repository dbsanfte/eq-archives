For what exactly? most people who "need plat" don't. The only real use 
for plat is to save oneself from having to camp tedious items... so 
spending the plat you earn along the way to buy items is a good use of 
the money and it saves you time, while letting you have more fun. But if 
your spending 10 hours a day farming plat ... your engaging in a tedious 
camp to avoid a tedious camp... why not just forget about it, go have 
some real fun, and accumulate the plat normally??

I think it would decrease the satisfaction gained from actually playing 
the game over the long run. When so many of us cherish  our fond 
memories of working our way up its bizarre that so many of us rob any 
newbie we see of those same memories.

As much as I abhor buying plat in RL...just to put it into perspective 
given that ige sells 1k for 1$ (less if you buy bulk) , you could work a 
4 hour shift at mcdonalds and walk away with several times what you are 
getting right now. *And* you'd still have 6 hours a day to really play 
eq instead of farm pp.

Farming pp is a *waste* of time unless your in a 3rd world country or 
something. Play EQ because its fun, or get a job. But don't *work* in 
EQ.

Defending farming pp is like wandering around the streets looking for 
dimes and gloating how you have so much freedom and don't have a boss. 

The reality: Yes, you've got freedom. But you work 10 hours a day for 
squat. If you worked 1 hour a day, you'd make more money, and have more 
spare time too, real spare time.

I see all these guides on how people make 3kpp/h and nonsense like that. 
I figure I should write one:

42s l33t pP m4kinG guid3:

Babysit your neighbours kid for 3 hours @ $4/h. Take the money (if your 
lucky they'll likely tip the 12 they owe you to 15) and use it to buy 
15k. That's 5kpp/h, and all you'll have to do is watch a disney movie, 
give her a snack, put her to bed, and then watch some TV until her 
parents get home.

And if you can find a job that pays more than $4/h the profits just get 
that much better!!!

If your unemployed, spend your time finding a job. It might seem easier 
to play EQ for the pp, but if its really pp you are after, you are 
better off spending your time looking for work... or rearranging your 
priorities.

In fact, rearranging your priorities so that you are still playing EQ, 
but doing something more interesting than making a poverty inducing 
career out of farming ice giants is really best solution.

I'd never set out to induce someone to patronize IGE... but the 
alternative, doing something interesting with your play time... that I'm 
all for.

=)
