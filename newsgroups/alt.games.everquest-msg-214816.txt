Well the shaman epic is a piercer.  And shaman are a bit more likely to
actually continue to melee, much better suited to it than druids.  Personally,
I quit turning the attack button on the day my 49 shaman faced two identicle
mobs, put pet on one and melee'd the other, only to find the pet finished with
its mob and joining in on mine before I'd even gotten mine to the 75% hp mark.
My pet was also at 25% hp while I was at full... so I was the bettter sponge
but my melee damage output was so bad that its better to not attack, so I get
the mana back for "sitting" since I'm on a mount.
