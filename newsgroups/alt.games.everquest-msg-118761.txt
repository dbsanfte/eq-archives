Hmm.. i think we in that case ARE getting the bad rep if we do steal from
what
should have been the groups loot (or actually the looters loot, because of
the
lootsystem, but that is another can of worms) when we pick pockets of mobs.
Because the rogue isn't going to give up to the group what he honestly stole
is he?
After all he IS a rogue :))

I would say it is bad. Not picking magic stuff, that is right it is meant
players should kill mobs
not just rob them or their good stuff..
