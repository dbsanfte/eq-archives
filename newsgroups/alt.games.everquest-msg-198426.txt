I don't know how stable your connection is, but mine is a bit jumpy. I find
that my char ends up turning, at the rate I was turning at, with the mouse,
during a short interruption. This doesn't seem to happen with the keys. This
has led to some nasty falls / lava / agro accidents, so I don't tend to use
the mouse in "dangerous" areas.
