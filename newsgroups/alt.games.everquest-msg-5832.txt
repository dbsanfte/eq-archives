LOL no... no .. NO... I HATE shopping. This is merely a search and retrieve
mission to Best Buy (okay.. with a LITTLE stop at either Starbucks or Tim
Horton's... lol as a reward for my pain...) straight INTO BEST BUY..
straight to software, games.... and HOPEFULLY within about 10 minutes, to
the checkstand with a CD of EQ in my hands.

I am allergic to shopping. :(

But this is a necessary evil at holidays....
