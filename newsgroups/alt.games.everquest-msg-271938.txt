I think Sony is trying to think ahead. I really wanted to try out
Everquest when I finally bought a PC (2 years ago), but I just couldn't
get into it because the graphics made me want to vomit.
This is not usually the case. I've played games for many years and
would consider myself one of those people who will play a game because
its good (enjoyable) no matter the graphics. Sadly, the graphics held
me back from EQ. That's why I was excited for the release of EQ2. Then
when I read on the packaging about the game being designed for future
hardware, something clicked with me because of my EQ experience.
On another note, what settings do you tweak to get better performance.
I have the auto set to performance, but I haven't spent much time
looking at each individual setting.
