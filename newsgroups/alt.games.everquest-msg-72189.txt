You may be right. I always bind myself just inside Oasis of Marr, right next to
the water, whenever I go there, and Gate back whenever I'm ready to exit the
zone. A few nights ago I got the `loading wait' message while I was aggro to
some Orcs (almost the whole party got wiped out by four Orcs (1 Priest & three
Warriors, two of which conned red to everyone) that got pulled by accident; my
Necro and the group's Druid were the only survivors, iirc). But I later used
Gate again while I wasn't aggo to anything, and did it again last night. No
`loading' message.
