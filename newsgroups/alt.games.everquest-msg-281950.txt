I have to agree.  Since I am a regular participant in those raids, that
for the serious "casual" player, the game has never been better.
Lately I find it hard to answer whether I'm casual, raider or soloer.
The game has always(at its core) been about fun and friends and I think
that that along with the lack of real challenges(elsewhere) is what
will keep EQ1(live) going(at least until Vanguard).
