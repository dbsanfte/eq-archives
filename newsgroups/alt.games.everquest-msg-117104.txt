I agree with you, the minute I dropped it on the ground, I understood
the risk I was taking. Had this been a high price, hard to get, or
rare item, obviously I would have contacted someone I knew or gone
some place safe to do the transfer.  With all the stuff others have
given me in the game, this pack was no big deal. I actually got a
chuckle out it, it was kinda funny the way it happened.......but I did
think it worth posting just to warn others what can happen if you
don't take proper precautions.  Too bad you can't open joint bank
accounts huh  :-)
