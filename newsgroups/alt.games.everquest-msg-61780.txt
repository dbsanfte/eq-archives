Get that knife from ToFS that summons bandages for you.  With that,
you don't need a ton of pack space.

Twinked warriors actually solo quite well.  With their high HP and AC,
they don't need to start at full HP.  Half from bandaging is enough
(besides, a twink can bandage past half).  Give the twink a regen
item, too, if you really want to make a soloing machine.
