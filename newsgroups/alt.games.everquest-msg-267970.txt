So far, I've only completed butterfly sets, and yes - he collectes
thtem.

I completed 2 of the sets before finding out the quest was broken - it
was fixed, but too late for me.  After completing the third and final
set, I got a new quest - to complete the other 2 sets which, as I
already competed them, was no good.

Now, when you complete a set, he'll ask you to bring him the other 2.
When you do, I think you get something to display in your home as a
reward.
