All your examples were independent of life support at some time in the
past and are no longer. They were fully developed and viable. The fetus
is not and never was.

This concludes the conversation, I guess. And as we slowly drift off
into the sunset still searching for intelligent life, the theme music
comes up against a symbolically fraught and glorious sunset.
