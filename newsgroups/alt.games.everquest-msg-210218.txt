That's some interesting info in that drop down. Crushbone and Befallen have
the same zem as PC and Kurns is only 10 less too. Could probably do well
going newb zone > kurns/CB > PC. Kurns is such an easy zone too with the
tiny agro range of the mobs. Wonder what Sony bases the ZEM on? Zone
difficulty is definately not the answer
