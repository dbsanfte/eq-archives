This is level 63 and 64 spells we are talking about.  The way casters
get improvements that melee get from the simple fucking act of dinging.

Seen it done, if you never did it, kudos to you.

For others its the only way you can get certain classes through the
trials.  For mainstream guilds with a level spread it is fucking idiotic
to expect them to just wave goodbye to friends in order to use a decent
experience zone.  Fucking idiotic.

This is the first fucking tier end flag.  The difficulty is set *way*
too high.

Valor.

I bet 99% of monks never thought their class would be redefined too...

If that's the model, it's pretty damn stupid.  You may be right but that
doesn't mean those who see it shouldn't point out what fucking idiocy it
is.
