Debuffs of AC and ATK aren't going to make or break a raid, the FR decrease
is nice, however you have it to high, Ro's disjunction overwrites Ro's
sundering, so FR is only down 60 points (still have to cast both usually
though, since Sundering is lure based and disjunction isn't)

Root does damage, so isn't control on summoners, also a lot of raid
encounters involve unrootable/unsnareable things, or permarooted things.

Our heals suck major donkey balls (check out the "State of the Druid" post
on the druid's grove) and we can't even effectively heal AoE damage on a
group, our port abilitys have been nerfed into oblivion with Luclin (no
ports for an entire expansion), RotG can now be done by shamans, PotG
doesn't stack with group Aego, and is fucking overwritten by group Aego,
DoT's aren't effective against boss-style fights because of agro, DD spells
can be done more efficiently by a wizard if you're chosing who to take.
