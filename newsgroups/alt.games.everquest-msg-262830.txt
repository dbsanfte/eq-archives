They shouldn't be 'encouraged', but given the option if they wish to
pursue it.  That option exists now for non-NO DROP items, but creates a
situation where there are farmers providing the service rather than the
company themselves.  The farmers have the very real potential to hurt
the game a lot more than people who buy stuff they wouldn't be able to
get through their normal playing.

What is the harm in not letting them keep up with their friends?
Alienating them from the group they like because of other commitments?
Seems to me the harm is pissing them off to the point that they quit the
game.  Players like that are a great profit source for a MMORPG because
they pay the same amount as everybody else, but use less bandwidth.  It
would harm the game more to not let them buy stuff than it would to buy
stuff.

If you play golf half as much as your father, you still have the option
to purchase equipment on par with his.  It might make the game a little
easier for you, but you will most likely still get tromped by somebody
with lesser gear and more time to practice.  Same as in EQ.  If you just
buy equipment and don't learn your character, you will get beat down by
a lot lower level things than somebody who doesn't have the equipment
but has the knowledge.

As far as why should you be concerned that you only progressed half as
far, why should you be concerned that somebody is buying equipment?  It
is not a competitive game between players (unless you are on a PvP
server), but against the environment.  Equipment gives the players a
buffer level to take on more content.  Why should it concern you they
get that opportunity without camping for x hours to get a drop?  My main
concern is for friends being able to keep up with each other when other
stuff pops up.  One of the things I liked about SWG (the only thing? ;))
was that there were no 'levels' and if I couldn't log in for months at a
time, I could still group with my friends when I got back.  If
purchasing equipment outside the game allows that, it should be an
option.
