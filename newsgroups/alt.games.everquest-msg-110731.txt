Once more into the breach...
The possibility of perceiving "universal good" and/or "universal evil"
does not imply that in any individual case it will be perceived.  The

fact that a particular individual does not perceive something does not
cause it not to matter, failing to perceive a virus does not prevent
it from causing a fatal illness.

I would argue that the purpose of our existence is, in part, to discover
these and other "universal truths", but that is a matter of belief, I
know of no way to prove it in the context of the world as we know it.


Before you write me off as just another superstitious looney, take a
moment to consider how full of "received truth" our modern scientific
word-view is.  Have you ever personally perceived a quark?  Have you
personally verified a repeatable instance of time-dilation?  Have you
watched a species evolve?  We tend to accept the considered analysis
of the "scientific community" (with good reason I think) in choosing
what to believe about these concepts.  But that does not provide us
with an airtight logical basis to reject mystical/spiritual beliefs
out of hand.  Ok, now you can write me off...
