Yep, later in the thread I said as much, though less clearly:

"I do have to say I can see where I was overly naive in claiming that 
spending twice as much to make half again as much is a bad idea.  This 
is because I fluffed that up into one term: spend x to make x, spend 2x 
to make 1.5x.  But that should be two terms, spend y to make x, spend 2y 
to make 1.5x.  And then you look at x-y versus 1.5x-2y.  Assuming Y is 
sufficiently small, then this could be a good increase in profit... even 
if that actual final figure was 1.5x-10y."

Your way says the same thing a lot more clearly, though.
