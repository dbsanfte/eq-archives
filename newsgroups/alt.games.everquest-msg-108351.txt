Yes, Trak is protected.  But the staggered spawn times (and any
delays while guilds mobilize on the ones they didn't get after a
server set) means they can clear all the ones they don't get every
other week.

That's several dragons (and not only ones in Kunark) that are
trivial to one unbalanced group that can port themselves into
pulling position within minutes of a spawn.  I expect it will be
nerfed pretty quickly, either by doing a max of some percentage
of the mob's health or by making mobs invulnerable to repeated
casts (get hit by one, get flagged to resist others for 10 minutes,
etc.)
