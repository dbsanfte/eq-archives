I finally got Luclin. Spent all night wandering around Shadowhaven
looking for mage spells. Notice the map that came in the manual has
the north and south reversed, maybe I was just high?   Finally found
the spells.

Servers were down when woke up this morning, so put together a
comprehensive collection on how to get to Katta Castellum. The level
39 and 44  mage research *PET* spells are there. I'm psyched. Got a
fistfull of papers, details on how to get there, lists of spells to
get, bag full of gold, but no server to log into.  I'm licking my
chops.
