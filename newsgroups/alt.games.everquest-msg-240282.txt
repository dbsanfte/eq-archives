With everything you have said there is one thing you have not admitted.
Except for the occasional need for a warrior to use Defense, Knights and
Warriors are both equally able to be a HP sponge.  So for when you must take
on a big bad ugly and your grp needs you to use your Defense, then you are a
better tank to get beat on.  However, in an EXP grp, and a knight and
warrior who are equally outfitted with great gear, the knight brings more to
the show than a warrior would ever be able to bring.
