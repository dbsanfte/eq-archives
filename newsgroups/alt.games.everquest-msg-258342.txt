My favorite rule for proceeding from a four-way stop was a driving
school instructor's response to the question "Who goes first if cars
going all four directions arrive at once?", which was "Not me".

I fail to see anything inherently silly about interacting courteously
with another human being, but then I guess I'm just a bit silly that
way.  :-p  (And no, I don't want to hear any snide remarks about my
less than courteous posts here.  I mean, this is usenet, everything
is anonymous, you aren't really human beings, just figments of my
computer's imagination.  Or maybe...  Yes!  Of course!  You're all
traitors!  Corrupt saboteurs bent on destroying our beloved Alpha
Complex!  Quickly, summon the Vultures to deal with the traitors!)
