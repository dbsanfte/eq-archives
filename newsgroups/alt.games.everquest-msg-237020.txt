It may not be for you, but have you heard the theory of writing down
your thoughts to gather them in to a cohesive mass... This process
sometimes has the benefit of being able to see everything in black and

prayer is for the worshiper.

All knowing or not, humans are not perfect, we are often extremely
flawed.
