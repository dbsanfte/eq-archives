Chances are by the time I sell my Ghoulbane I will get another to replace
it.  Far out, sure I miss my Mith BP, but I would much rather be doing +3
damage per hit (with chance of +6 when I reach 20) and have 2 less AC, -30HP
and -15AGI.  And chances also are I will be able to buy another Mith BP
before I can do the Ghoulbane quest.  (Actually the deal was quite good -
Mith BP sells for about 700pp, Berserker Sword for about 400pp (or less),
making about 1100pp I paid, when he wanted 1400pp).
