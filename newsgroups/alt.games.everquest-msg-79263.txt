That's probably true...I'm not a video geek so I can't corroborate that.

My P4 1.6 w/256MB 800MHz Rambus RAM zones only seconds faster than my Athlon
700 w/512 133MHz SDRAM (PC133).  Both computers have most models turned off
(the same models), both have the same options on/off.  If Rambus wasn't so
expensive I'd bump that up to 512 (probably 768) turn on all the bells &
whistles and see how they compare. :)
