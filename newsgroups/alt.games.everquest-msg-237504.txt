|No. It describes a perfect being.

	No, it describes the most powerful being in a flawed universe.  It is not
even remotely perfect, and doesn't come anywhere near being a supreme moral
authority.

	Not in mine.  It's just a powerful alien being.  Besides, there could be
more than one of them.

	That is debatable.

|Absolutely irrelevant.

	There are several centuries of debate over the problem of evil which
suggest it is relevant.

|brought about much good.
|
|If that's a standard reply to evil I think you must have mis-related
|it. Because I doubt anyone would assign 'good' and 'evil' like that.

	If it is logically necessary that the man kill the woman, then how is it
morally justifiable to accord him *infinite punishment* for *doing god's
work*?
