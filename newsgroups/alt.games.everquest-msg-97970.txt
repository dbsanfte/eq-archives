Bah, if anyone gets a rez spell besides clerics, it should be druids.
Shamen are already wanted in dungeon/raid groups for their slow spells
and buffs; but druids go begging. A rez spell of some sort might really
help with that. This is one druid who'd be *really* PO'ed if Verant gave
a rez to the shammies.
