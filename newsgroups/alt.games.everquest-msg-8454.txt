Actually most are worth doing.

The thing you have to remember, though, is that they're worth
doing only if you're the appropriate class, race, and/or
level that the particular quest was designed to help.

So what you have to do is research quests to find out
which ones are appropriate for your character at its
current level.

Even some of the ones that aren't ever "worth doing" for the
actual reward (e.g., the Falchion of the Koada'Vie quest
for Paladins, since the reward sword has become VERY
outmoded by easy drops of better weapons which were added
to the game later) are fun for the journey that they
lead you on and the story that they tell.
