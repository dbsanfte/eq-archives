It is also very useful for Clerics who are on the ball to back up
Enchanters.  Having a mid thirties cleric and enchanter I'm speaking
strictly to the mid game.
When an enchanter is running around mezzing creatures he may or
may not have time to mind wipe them.  Many times its a full time
job just cycling around and keeping all the adds from moving.
What this means though if the Mez breaks the creature may head
straight for the enchanter.  This is *BAD*.  Since my enchanter
only has a few hundred hit points many big creatures can take me
down in a few seconds.  With your Atone spell you can remove
the enchanter from the creatures hate list.  So if someone (or time)
breaks the Mez early, the creature will go for the nearest player
(or the tank who awoke the creature).

On a side note, Atone is also great for getting creatures off of
yourself.  If you cast a heal and a creature comes screaming
towards you, you cast atone on him and then he'll go back to
the Tanks.  This can be used to help out enchanters, wizards,
and others who may have incurred agro who do not want it.

You may want to be somewhat careful though, as I
understand it the Atone spell removes hate from the top of
the list.  Which means if a creature is fighting a Tank and
you cast Atone and the mob has sufficient hate counters on
it, the mob may head towards a enchanter or yourself.

Hopefully that gives you some ideas on what you can use
Atone with!  Its a very useful spell!
