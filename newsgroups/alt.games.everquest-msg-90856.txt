Err, I think you missed the point. The original poster said he liked corpse
runs. Would YOU run across six zones to your corpse, like he obviously
would.
He said he liked running around and exploring. Sure, running from QH to
Halas is ok. But how often to do run from Halas to Freeport. Once I died in
the Qeynos Underground, and was bound in FV. I WAsS not gonna do a standard
cr from there.
