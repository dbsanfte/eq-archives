Ok....the cleric who is LEAVING her group to get KEI is inconsiderate,
granted.  Such behavior is silly and it does indeed breed bad clerics.
 That's not really what I want to address.

At that level, I can agree with your disgust at her CH practice.  When
I was that level, I waited to start CH until 45% or so, unless I saw
that a tank was dropping too fast for that.  If the tank's dropping
like a rock, I would start it at 80%; my ego is not worth the death of
the tank.

However, I disagree totally with your philosophy that a group that is
entirely at full health equals wasted mana on the part of the cleric. 
It shows forethought.

At level 52, any cleric worth his salt should be able to keep a group
at 100% between pulls except in the following conditions:

1. No mezzer and 2 or more walkers, or even just 1 add if the walking
mob is red and a fast/heavy hitter.

2. No slower and the mob hits heavy for the con. 

3.  The mob AoEs (rare except in raids). 

4. One member of the group is a cannibalizer (this is something I've
had to learn to deal with - I am fanatical about my group's health,
and cannibalizers usually want you to leave them alone except in
extreme situations).


My mana pool at 52 was about 4k.  I am not rich; I am a high elf who
put 25 points into wisdom at creation.  Conventional wisdom, no pun
intended, states that this is unwise and that high elves should put
points into stamina leaving wisdom alone, but I have never had a hit
point or AC problem; I'm usually able to cast on through, and my
defense is excellent.

I liked to have KEI at 52, I'll admit it; but I would never leave a
group to get it.  I could, except in extreme situations, keep my group
at 100% between pulls and keep the members alive during pulls without
any kind of a mana buff.  This is not bragging; merely to state that,
because of the person and player that I am, the health of my group
members is too important to me for me to allow people go below 100%
health if I can avoid it, thus leaving us upprepared for the
unexpected.

Doing this makes both me and the rest of the group feel far more
secure.  I could and can do this without shorting myself the mana
needed to continue with heals during the pulls; rarely have pulls had
to stop because I needed a med break.  How, then, am I wasting mana?

The way I look at it, I am directly responsible for the level of fun
the group has playing.  I take deaths in my groups very hard, because
that person will have less fun because I couldn't stop the death. 
Likewise, if my group is nervous and thinks that I am not as concerned
for their well-being as possible, they have less fun, so I have less
fun.  Keeping the group at 100% whenever feasible eliminates this
factor.

I am constantly doing math in my head.  I know exactly how much my
mana pool is, exactly how much each of my spells costs me in mana, and
exactly how fast I can expect to regenerate between pulls.  If I
couldn't handle keeping a group at full health and still handle the
unexpected crisis, I would know.  Good clerics know their limitations,
but they also know their assets.

As for KEI/VoQ - well, I prefer to have one of them, but I don't need
them.  Please don't assume that accepting a KEI makes one a bad
player.  If the group lives because the healer had extra mana, then
all to the good, IMO.
