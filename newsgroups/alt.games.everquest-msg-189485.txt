Its not a hugely perfect visual representation no, but then coding every
single item would be a graphical nightmare - Im not aware of any neck item
I have worn ever being visible, nor rings, nor a number of other items
(this is why they coded in inspect, [OK that particualar function has
evolved to other views within the EQ playerbase]).....it would overlap
with the place they put graphic for too many helmet graphics and make the 
whole thing look messy - on the other hand you can wear a heavy
reinforced dragonhide mask under a tight fitting helmet so there is a
plus there in the loss of realism.

Shiny Brass Shield that drops off the trainer in Crushbone is a good one
for sub 20 characters - and possibly a bit beyond that....
