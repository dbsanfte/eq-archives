So, basically, you only go raiding for the main tank, and everyone else just
get the honor of helping to equip him?  Dunno, that just doesn't sound right
to me.  Yeah, I understand the idea of "for the good of the guild," but this
is a guild, not a nation.  A guild doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's made up
of players, many of whom would like to get something out of a raid every
once in a while.  Over time, if your off-tanks, and your enchanters, and
your clerics feel as if they're only being used to equip the MT, they're
going to go elsewhere.  Especially if they're required to put their lives on
hold and raid at least four times a week so that the MT can get uber gear.

Or, they just recently abandoned a social guild who wasn't "uber" enough for
them.

So it's best to spread the loot out, so the loss of one character doesn't
set the guild back.
