Current EverQuest? Maybe, but given that Ben, Fox and I have all left the 
game (as did you at one time), it appears to me that this game isn't meeting 
the standards that we are talking about here. I think the reason that it 
endures is what Graeme pointed to, that many of us keep coming back to see 
our friends who still play there. In fact, many of the same people are 
coming and going through this asynchronous cycle, which guarantees that at 
any given time there there will be some of them still playing that will 
attract the others to keep coming back in. LOL if we all left at the same 
time I doubt any of us would ever return!
