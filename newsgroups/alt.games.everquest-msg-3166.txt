I haven't tried that way, but I did have a level 11 Paladin who fell into
the water trying to jump from a Dwarf shuttle onto the ship.  Swam around
for quite a long time.  Maxed out my swimming skill.  Made a big circle
through the center of the zone trying to find land, constantly doing the
/loc command.  Someone gave me the coordinates for Ogre Isle.  I swam there
(reluctantly).... I ended up at a desolate edge of the island, camped, then
got the zone map off EQAtlas.com.

Logged back on, and swam for the Elven outpost on the other end of the zone
without any problems.

If you do get lost swimming in that zone, there are several islands that
would be very nasty to find yourself alone on (Raptor Isle, for one), or an
area in the very far south that's supposed to have a powerful dragon in the
water, so do be careful.
