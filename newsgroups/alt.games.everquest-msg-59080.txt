Charm is a skill more than a song.  You need to learn the timing, the
mob control, and the proper place to use it.  I learned it by charming
the gnolls outside Paw in SK, got good at it on cyclops in Rathe Mtns,
and perfected it on Hill Giants.  At 39 I could clear every HG and
cyclops in Rathe, solo.  It's the single most powerful song a bard
gets (OK, maybe 2nd behind selos).
The trick is learning how to use it.  Short version is this.
Make charming hotkey setup, with the following hotkeys:
/pet attack
/pet guard here
and song gems for selos, regen, and charmsong.  Also you need your
secondary weapon slot, and probably 2 main inventory slots, so you can
swap instruments out on the fly.
Equip drum, start playing selos.  Run up to one mob with another one
standing nearby.  Target mob, equip flute, sing charm-song.  If it is
resisted, swap out drum, sing selos one pulse, and run away backwards,
then repeat.  When song sticks, hit selos again, face 2nd mob, hit f8
to target 2nd mob, mash your /pet attack key.
Now hit f1 twice, which will select you, then your pet.  This is
important, you want to keep the same pet the entire time, and you MUST
do it if grouped.  Now back up a ways, you want to be well out of
melee range.  I alwasy swap my drum back in at this point, so I can
run faster, but you should be at sow speed without it, so it's
optional.  When selos pulses for the 3rd time, start the charm song
again, which should have it hit shortly after it break.  Hit selos, f8
to retarget, /pet attack, then f1 twice again.  Swap instruments as
required.  
Pay attention to which mob is winning, if your pet is losing you'll
need to switch targets, but not until he's almost dead.  If you switch
targets at less than about 20% health, he will ignore your pet and
come after you.  Generally you don't want to switch targets until your
pet is at the point where he runs away instead of attacks, which will
take a while to learn.  The way to switch targets is to just not hit
f1 twice after hitting /pet attack, when you recharm, you'll be
charming your former enemy, but he's stupid and doesn't know any
better.  :)
If you get hit and take damage, and are very good at twisting songs,
you can hit charm, selos, regen, selos, regen, charm and have the 2nd
charm hit about 2 seconds after the first breaks.  When I'm doing this
I use my flute to charm and my lute the rest of the time, since I'm
still faster but I need the extra healing more.  Or you could hit
charm, selos, wait 3 seconds after pulse, regen, wait 3 seconds after
pulse, charm, but I always mess up the timing trying to do that.

If you're grouped I would recommend modifying your hotkeys to be the
following:

/pause 5, /pet attack
/g I have charmed %t, please don't cast on it

and 

/pause 5, /pet guard here
/g my pet will break charm soon, kill %t as soon as you can


The timing to get the first one to work is a bit tricky, so if you
can't hit f1 twice after hitting /pet attack within 1/2 second, change
it to 
/pause 10, /pet attack
