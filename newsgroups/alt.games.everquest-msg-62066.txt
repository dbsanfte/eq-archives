Yes, you can use kunark, velious or luclin all with JUST old EQ
(kunark even comes with old EQ) and don't need ANY of the other ones
to use one with JUST old EQ and you can get to level 60 with ANY of
them and JUST old EQ.

You need kunark to get your epic though and velious for the pretty
velious armors (ESPECIALLY nice with the new luclin models I'd bet) so
i'd reccomend getting those too:

BONUS

Scars of velious mini box is now for sale again at the station store
and is only $14.99. That makes it worth it just for velious models and
such.

Something else to ask for XMAS at that price.
(Kunark is also sold at this price now.. add it up and they are
actually cheaper than the EQ trilogy for the same stuff)
