37 enchanter workin on 39 For new spells... once I hit 39 I was wondering
what quests I should work on? When I say this I also want to let be known
that I've never really done quest's before... Only exception is Stien of
Maggok long time ago at level 12... I'm still wearing alot of Raw silk
heh... I'm in guild that can give me high level help if needed and am crazy
enough to try doing stuff solo if need be... thanks for your time and Sage
advise
