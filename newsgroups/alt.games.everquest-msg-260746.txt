Odd, druids seem to be quite prevelant on EMarr.  I group with them 
often.  In a number of places I xp, it is prudent to have a healer in 
addition to a slower, particularly if you want to keep things moving 
fast.

Depends a lot on where you are, and how fast mobs are being pulled.  
XPing in PoE, I find it prudent to have healer plus shaman or healer plus 
chanter.  Healer can be a shaman in either case.
