Also none of which can a Wizard do.  This is one of the biggest drawbacks to
our class, and the main reason that Wizards are invited LAST of all casters
into groups (of any level... let me ask you level 10's, if a Wizard can stop
the mob can gating will it make you more likely to invite one into your
group? [if you answered "MOBs can gate?" you've proven my point]).

The appropriate thing to do is to advise the group that you are getting full
resists.

Then sit down to med, and pay attention.  If the fight is going well for
your side, don't worry. If not... then worry.

If you are the only caster, /assist the mob, and damage shield that person.
If the mob is switching targets, then damage shield everyone in melee.
(O'Kiels Radiation... the duration sucks, and the damage back is light...
but it will hurt mobs you can't touch otherwise).

If there're other casters, then odds are your damage shields "would not have
taken hold." In which case try 'em anyway (unless you see the damage shield
messages, in which case, don't waste the time/mana).  Or the druid will
overwrite your shields, and you will have wasted the mana.

On that same note, though...
I killed an Aviak Avocet in SK at level 20ish once, with a Paladin, a Cleric
and me all of us about the same level.  The paladin could barely hit it...
my nukes wouldn't stick... and there was no way we were going to make the
zone.  So I DS'd (and kept it on) the pally, and the cleric kept healing
him... eventually the bird fell... and we survived... and we tossed out the
warrior who ran when he saw that the Avocet was looking in our general
direction.
