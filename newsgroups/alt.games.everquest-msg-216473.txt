I've seen the charisma thing in action.  At level 46 ish my cleric with
a 60 charisma (DE) would almost always pull the lot when the pacifiy
resisted (about 10 % of the time).  With two opal encrusted steins and
a shaman charisma buff, I've only had failure that resulted in a pull.
(less than 1 % of the time)  It put my charisma up to about 125 ish.

I think what most people don't realize is that in LDoN the agro and
social radius of most mobs seems to be about  the same.  Its pretty
far out, but not soo big you can't land a pacify from a ways out.   If
I had to guess, I think most people are pacifying the pull target.  Most
will pacify everyone around the next target and then pull, but in LDoN
the social radius still crosses most mobs, and pacify only drops that
radius down to almost nothing.
So long story short, pacify everything!  Once pacified I've had two
mobs standing right next to each other and only one came (but don't
sit on top of them!)
