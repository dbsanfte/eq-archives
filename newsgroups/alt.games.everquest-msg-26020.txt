Are you going through any kind of connection sharing software?  If so,
and you've recently changed that software, you may need to configure
it differently.  EQ, like most games, uses UDP rather than TCP.  UDP
is not a connection-oriented protocol, so connection sharing software
has to make some guesses to handle it, and there are some timeouts
involved.  When you zone, the port changes, and that can sometimes
cause some problems.

For instance, under RedHat Linux 6.x, using ipchains to set up
sharing, everything worked fine.  Using the exact same commands under
RedHat 7.1 leads to the login screen on 90% of zonings for me.  Some
people have got it to work on RH 7.1 by setting the UDP timeout way
up.  That didn't help me, but switching from ipchains to iptables
fixed it.
