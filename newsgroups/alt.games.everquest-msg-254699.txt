These are both more or less straight copies of the warrior disciplines
Furious and Fortitude. Fortitude, or Battle Focus in this case, is generally
better for that "Gotta stay alive another few seconds for a heal to land"
situations for two main reasons. One, you can't riposte from the sides or
back, so if you have more than one mob hitting you or you get spun around,
Reckless/Furious does 0 to keep you alive. Two, you can't riposte a flurry.
Not a big deal obviously at the lower/middle end of the game, but a very big
deal once you get into places like Plane of Earth, where just about every
single mob flurries. I mainly use Furious with my warrior for the
opening/positioning of raid targets, to give the cheal chain a chance to get
settled in and give myself a quick aggro boost. For a Zerker, I could see it
being useful if you were soloing and you weren't sure who was going to drop
first, you or the mob. Otherwise I would stick with Battle Focus for the
that extra bit of safety.
