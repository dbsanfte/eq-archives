Wizard epic gives mana regen, as well as -
A Rune V when you over agro that has no component
A means to mod rod without taking damage so you mana regen with no low
health downside

Do you have any 60 enchanters?
VoG is just SO much better than SoS, imo that = worthless epic (VoG isnt a
rare spell that your guilds 60 chanters won't ever get)

Look at the time invested in PoA, Chardok and camping Sev.. that would
easily guarantee a Vaniki pop

Swiftblade of Zek, Fleshgrinder, Willsapper, the stuff from Umbal, Rhag2 (i
forget but its primal ratio), 2 primal ratio weapons in greigs both killable
with 2 groups (13/20), Taskmaster Abbot in GD, Im not a warrior so I know
theres a LOT im forgetting/don't know to mention

> And is Statue "probably easier than the Queen in Chardok" too?

Statue really is a wimpy mob, I mean that.

You'd probably laugh if I told you theres dragons in nToV that your guild
could kill too right now, but with a few tactics and attempts its easily
possible.   Kreizen is a Naggy clone, Koi is a joke, the electric tripplet
is too pathetic for words...

Of course you have to go past Aary and Flurry drakes first and they make
Vindi look like an orc pawn, but Vindi/Statue is a similar deal.. kill a
"tough" mob.. get access to a gimp mob with phat loots as your reward

I doubt you'd get Statue pulled with Vindi still up.. the difference though,
statue is slowable. Sure he needs a good mana supply, but its a slow and
forgiving fight.. Vindi is fast and will destroy your raid in a second flat

BL's get 2 claws, and 1 procs a slow.
