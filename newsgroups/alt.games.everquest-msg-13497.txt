I'm pretty new (read DUMB???)  It is going to take me a while to wade through
the 28 printed pages of this post, but I skimmed it as best possible in an
hour.  A couple of questions / clarifications that seem to jump out at me
please help:
Ok so some high level guild was abusing a game bug and got busted?  And from
their guild chat they knew it was a bug?  And the Verant decision was to ban
them - not forever, for seven days?  and disband their guild?  But they were
allowed to loot the corpses before the "7 day banning period" started?
Those who were "busted" quickly listed all others who were "present at the
crime scene but not online now to be busted" ? Or did I read that wrong... ? 
and...
Was the defense basically "well John Doe and Joe Smith and Adam Baker did this
first, are you "banning" them too?"
I am fairly new to the game.  What am i missing?
