Hey guys, anybody do this? Two-box using a KVM switch to switch between the 
PCs/instances of EQ?

I just got a new PC I have not setup yet and I am giving my old one two my 
daughter and putting hers on the floor next to mine, hooking it into the 
network via ethernet and using it for whatever (have not really decided yet) 
via a KVM switch. This extra PC is a HP Pavilion with a Celeron 2.2, 512 MB 
RAM and onboard Intel video. I know it runs EQ ok although certainly nothing 
like my new PC will.

If I try 2 boxing with this setup using a KVM switch, I'll run EQ without 
Luclin models at all on the slower PC to ensure decent performance I think, 
although I suppose I could try it both ways and see how it does.

I haven't used a KVM switch before but I think it is pretty much 
instantaneous switching so I am thinking that flipping back and forth to 
control characters might be doable.

My first foray into doing this would be to use my 65 cleric to buff and heal 
a new character of mine while they solo and xp. I have an 11 Druid that I 
might try this out with as well as a baby Ogre warrior and some others.

So, I was just wondering if anybody else here does this and how well I might 
expect it to work. I've got to do all the fooling around to setup the new 
PC, move mine to my daughter's room, her's to floor next to my new one and 
do all the settings, data transfer and reinstalls associated with that so 
there goes this whole afternoon I'm sure. :-)
