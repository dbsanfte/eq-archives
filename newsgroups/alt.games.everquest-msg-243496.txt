OK, I go into most, maybe every city, and I see a "Tribute _______".   What
is the purpose of this NPC?  I have hailed them and and they tell me all
about the benefits of paying tribute, but when I try to offer them 2gp they
tell me they are not worthy and to pay someone else.
How do I find the correct NPC to pay a tribute too?
Is it something a lvl 15 and under should do?
What are the "real" benefits to paying a tribute?

TIA
