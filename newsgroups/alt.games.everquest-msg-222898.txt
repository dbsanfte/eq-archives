No you did too. To mathematically express what you've done:

Premises:
1) God can, from omnipotence, create mountains that are arbitrarily 
large. OR equivalently God can, from omnipotence select integers that 
are aribtrarily large (and make mountains that heavy).

2) God can, from omnipotence, lift *any* finite weight. Or equivalently 
God's lifting capacity is boundless.

Question: Can God create a mountain so heavy that he cannot lift it?

Question in pure math: Select an integer x, such that x > infinity.

The proof of the absurdity is trivial,

Alternatively you could suggest that God ought to be creating a mountain 
that is 'infinitely heavy', but then we're comparing two scalar 
infinities, which is improper, and drawing any conclusions from that is 
just as absurd.

Your example is as 'impossible' as expressing pi as an integer.

You are incorrectly equating what 'you can do' with what 'can be done'. 
These are not the same sets. As evidence: I cannot speak Spanish, yet it 
is clear that speaking Spanish is something that can in fact be done.
