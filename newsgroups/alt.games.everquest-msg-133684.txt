    And we did, last night. =) =) =) =) =) =) We're going to Vex Thal!!!
Drops were melee shoes, caster cloak, and the "OMG" robe.

    Good luck, Ben. We found the same thing - get a few more people things
they didn't think were important, like offhand Bane, and we had enough. We
dropped him in about 30 minutes, IIRC - that's the time to aim for. For
reference that's with 80 people (we have over 110 keyed - see what I mean
about a lot of part-time players?) And a tip: every time a main tank died it
was because we had a healing gap from clerics looking for mod rods. Every.
Last. Time.

    Yeah, FG poos. Our warriors swear by them - great way to catapult
yourself up the hate list after any de-aggro effect. Positioning is the key
to holding that aggro, but for build-up they go with snare pods.

    I think they start off with at least hate offhand. I recognized the
profile of a baby rattle on one warrior and a Lammy on another before I
started looking at the ground. I didn't even know he was dead until the
whoops started - no faction hit for me. Then I looked up and saw he'd moved
to within melee distance of me during the fight - which explained why every
so often I'd see some tank's feet walk across our mod rods!

    Our first three main tanks are trolls - we use the sheer power of ugly
to generate hate. Especially the female troll warlord. ;-)

    LOL, yup. Pure cheddar. If there were something Wrackable in the room
we'd have them there, but there isn't. This, like snare pods, is something
we figure will eventually be fixed so we're still working on things like mod
placement (we can keep modding up all fight, but we risk more healing gaps
that way). I must admit that my "If you aren't a cleric or mage GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM ME" hotkey worked wonders that fight for keeping greedy wizards
off the rods, though.

    On the offtanking? Oh, I beg to differ there. The ability of a cleric to
keep tanks up and running for nearly an hour of offtanking is on a par with
a shaman's ability to do the same. We prefer the shaman only because the
mobs need to be slowed anyways, and torporing an offtank actually helps keep
the offtank mob alive. And having a warrior there would be huge - the
ability to AoE Taunt and tank in case an enchanter got too many resists/went
LD would be crucial in saving a bad situation.

    The numbers issue I refer to is the number of clerics and warriors in
the guild. We have them pretty much all assigned jobs away from the
offtanking, so setting them as offtanks hurts us elsewhere. If we were like
our competition, with minimal hybrids and a metric ton of warriors, we'd
have warrior offtanks.
