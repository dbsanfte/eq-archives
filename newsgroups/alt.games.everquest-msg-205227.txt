Well, when we were doing this in our 50s, it was pretty much a full on 
raid force required to do any of the golems there.  Usually was 4 to 6 
groups of average level of low to mid 50s.  If you can get mostly people 
closer to 65, then it would not surprise me to hear you can do the non 
DTing golem with one group or less.  He has an AoE cold attack that is 
not hard to resist.

The other golem that spawns an Iksar Broodling upon death DTs the person 
highest on the hate list every 45 seconds, so you need enough bodies 
there for the length of fight you are going to have to make it through.  
Best hope is get a vollunteer to take the first DT, then kill him fast, 
preferably in under 45 seconds.  Expect not to do that though, expect to 
lose your MA after 45 seconds, so you better have someone ready to take 
over from him, and prefferably at least one more to take over from him.  
I don't recall how much hp they have, guessing 32k though.

You will have to clear out a bunch of mobs to get to the various golems, 
some of them do dispell, none of them are overly difficult if you have 
the forces to take on the golems.  Find a good map, and there are several 
good guides floating around out there, do a google search.
