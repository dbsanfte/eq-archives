Ha!  None of the old-world zones are perma-camped, far as I've seen,
except perhaps whichever ones are currently hotzones.

Anyway, I wouldn't suggest trying to raise plat by farming gear.  Farm
tradeskill stuff instead.  You already had that thought about the ores
in HoH but as you said you might want to save those for your own smith.
But in Old Seb you could farm Nodding Blue Lily, which still brings a
reasonable price, and since you didn't mention a shaman you don't need
alchemy ingredients for yourself.  You'll probably also get some of the
new spell research drops; not sure what level drops in Seb, probably
various levels of spell scrolls and perhaps papyrus, both of which sell
okay to researchers.  (If your necro wants to do spell research you may
want some of those for yourself.)
