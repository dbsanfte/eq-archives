This is an excellent response, Roger already pointed out that
there are groups where mana doesn't come into play at all, and I
replied that in most of those, HP regen can be substituted.

But you've gone a bit further, away from the einstien style
"kills=mana regen Csquared" idea to a "unified field theory" of
EQ that clears up a lot of the muddy water my original proposal
had buried in it.  Yes, for normal groups DPS and DS and Mezzing
and pull style and everything else could be related back into a
mana regen question; but in the end its probably better to think
of all these as a factor of time

From my experience as a bard I felt this was true, but my thesis
seemed to point the other way.  Thinking of things in terms of
time, though, its clear that sometimes DS, snareing, etc. etc.
are going to mean a greater time savings than would be generated
with mana song... and sometimes not.  As bards are a very
flexible class, but still can't do all things all the time, it
becomes important that they have a way to decide what -to- do. 
Having this idea explicit in the back of your head should help to
do that.

Does looking at EQ with this model in mind yeild any new
conclusions or change your views of any past situations?
