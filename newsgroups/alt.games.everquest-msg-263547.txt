You're joking, right? In the absence of any emoticons, I can only assume 
you aren't. Why implement crafting at all if that were the chosen design? 
It would be better to just make the stuff vendor-buyable or quest-only. 
There would be no sense in coding the game to allow a player to progress in 
that player's absence.
