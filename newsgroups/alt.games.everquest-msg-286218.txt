Just had the occasion to ride that one the other night. The boat model got 
a bit of an upgrade, and moves *much* faster now, so that the trip is quite 
bearable. The only problem was, with the OOT revamp, I couldn't remember 
which stop was which, as I didn't recognize any of the islands, and ended 
up missing my stop. :P
