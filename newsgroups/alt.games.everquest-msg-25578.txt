Now that pelts stack, I would like to build up a
stock of wolf and cat skins, for use in making
leather armor (I get lots of requests for druid
things) as well as increase my supply of brute
hides.

So, I am buying at the following prices:

    MQ cat or wolf: 1pp each
    HQ cat or wolf: 3pp each
    Regular brute hides: 5pp each
    HQ brute hides: 10pp each

I will soon be travelling to and binding in
Firiona Vie, and (being a druid) can travel to the
various druid rings for pick up.

On a related note, I am *selling* studded,
reinforced and imbued Vale studded armors,
assuming I have the skins to make your order. My
prices are

    Small or Medium Studded Leather: 1pp/AC
    Small or Medium Reinforced Leather 1.5pp/AC,
rounded up (reinforced has better AC and is a bit
lighter)
    Imbued Vale studded (Karana): 10pp/AC plus
20pp per stat point.

Vale leather can be worn by any class that can
wear leather, of any small to medium race. It
generally has the same AC as regular reinforced
and is significantly lighter. Imbued Vale can
*only* be worn by worshippers of Karana. Stats and
prices on the Vale studded is:

    Mask: 4 AC, +1 STA, +1 WIS = 80pp
    Gorget: 5 AC, +1 STA, +1 WIS = 90pp
    Wrist, Belt, Shoulder: 5 AC, +2 STA, +1 WIS =
100pp
    Cap, Gloves: 6 AC, +2 STA, +1 WIS = 120pp
    Sleeves, Boots: 6 AC, +2 STA, +2 WIS = 140pp
    Cloak: 6 AC, +3 STA, +2 WIS = 160pp
    Legs: 7 AC, +3 STA, +2 WIS = 170pp
    Tunic: 10 AC, +3 STA, +2 WIS = 200pp

Because of the demand for imbued Vale, I will be
unable to fulfil any orders for non-imbued Vale.
If you place an order and can supply some of the
skins/hides needed for that order, I will give you
a discount worth twice my buying price for the
skin/hide.

Look for Rosewhite Blossom on the Xev server. If
she is not on, try one of my alts: Witte (human
monk) or Tvon (erudite enchanter)
