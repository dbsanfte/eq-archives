This part sounds good, I like excitement more than static easy stuff,
and travel more than static sitting around camping a spawn.

Doesn't seem like something I should rush to buy as a level 61 mage
then... might as well wait till I hit 65... and even then, maybe wait
some more till I've got some gear better than raw silk (OK, its not
that bad, but anyone who's been in Elemental planes for any length of
time would say what I'm wearing is pretty much the same same as raw
silk)

Areas that get more and more difficult as you move thru them isn't
"scaling", scaling like I'm talking about is the sort you see in LDoN,
where a group of level 30s encounter wildly less powerful mobs than a
group of level 60s.

I recall this happening with POP and the POJ trials; whole classes
were ignored or brought thru only by concerted efforts of a band of
friends, contributing little on their own.  Its nice to see SOE
learned nothing from this about balancing things so every class was
still useful; this way I don't have to rework my established position
that they are a bunch of mindless Vogons who'd be better suited to
building hyperspace bypasses than administering a game.

Given that this is the case, are Magicians one of the "feh" classes
for the purpose?  I -could- go back to my cleric, but I've grown to
like FV and don't really want to move back to MT... and I even less
want to scrap my mage and start a new character on FV, only to
discover 6 months later when I'm level 65 again that they've decided
to do away with the GOD trials requirements as they did with POP.

I really enjoyed playing a shaman to 52, but they -were- the most
powerful class in the game at the time (IMO), and I'm not too
surprised to see them now suffering as one of the weakest, because SOE
never seems to correct balance issues, all they know how to do is
OVERcorrect.

Seems to me it would run out pretty fast, just as flagging my friends
in POJ got old quick enough.  Noble and all, but if they are then
moving on and doing the higher level stuff and you can't go, not
because they don't like you or appreciate what you did, but because
you'd be a liability and the difference between getting thru the trial
and not doesn't allow them to drag you along.

Eventually with POJ you had enough people who'd advanced past the
trials point and gained enough power that they could go out and pass
that trial with only 5 functional people, or 4 or even 3...  but that
took a while, and the progression  was pretty simple, consisting of
leveling up to 65.  Nothing comperable here, they have to get better
gear or something in order to make that big a difference.

Only hope is that for some reason your class is needed in the raids
against the higher level content, and so its worth getting guild
support together and pushing real hard to drag you thru.

Not my idea of how to build a game enviroment.

Splendid
