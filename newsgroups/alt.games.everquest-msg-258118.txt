Here's one example:

My berserker often serves (the gods alone know why) as MA, MT, Puller, 
and bottle washer (er, I mean snarer) in small groups and LDoNs.

I bring in a target, we all attack it, and the CC person gets everything 
else mezzed (I nearly always have a chanter with me for some reason, I 
seem to attract them).

Then I select the next target, announce it with a

/g my target is -{ my target is %t }-

and... wait.

People assist me and get into position around the mob; MT in the front, 
melee DPS around the back and rear arc sides, so on and so forth.

We're still waiting.

Up to 12 seconds (but usually only one or two seconds.)

For my stun to cycle.

Ah there it is.  Stun, attack, frenzy, disarm, if I had a kitchen sink 
button I'd hit that too.

Message shows up in yellowthat says

Grage broke mez

This is the signal for all hell to break lose, everyone hits attack and 
sends pets and so forth.

Mob stands there politely for 4 seconds, not moving, and by the time 
thats over, its very likely that the MA (usually me) has aggro and the 
mob doesn't move an muscle, just starts attacking.

IF someone in the group has his assist still on autoattack, back at the 
"assist me" step, he breaks mez, the mob runs for the chanter or healer, 
and there's a mass frenzy while we try to regain control.

Or he doesn't assist me, which means he may well have the wrong target, 
or he may be waiting till after I start to assist in which case he's 
likely throwing away a couple seconds worth of melee on a stunned and 
unresisting opponent; not a lot perhaps, but its just a waste.

Later, in raids, this sort of "fire discipline" will become crucial, you 
attack when and ONLY when the MA calls for it, whole raids have wiped 
over such seemingly quibbling details.  My system is a bit lazy, I 
-should- have hotkeys calling out each step, but my hotkey bar is full 
to the brim and I'm not a raid MA or raid puller, so its easier just to 
explain that everyone should assist me when I call target, and attack 
when mez breaks.

Course if they have GOD my target is also clearly designated with a 
funny white circle and arrows pointing to the name... but that doesn't 
work quite as well as I'd like, mostly its for the benefit of the 
enchanters... which could explain how I keep ending up grouping with them!
