I kept the lowest-level spells of all disciplines, for training purposes, 
and the highest unrestricted buffs of each category (meaning, the 
highest one that could be cast on a lvl 1 character). Some other low-
level spells are still situationally useful, like Flame Lick, but there 
are many others that I simply cannot fathom ever using again, such as 
the low level DoTs, or the mid-level skin buffs, or things like 
"camouflage" as opposed to "superior camouflage".

I also had the back of the book reserved for obsolete spells, but as I 
leveled, I found the back starting to crop slowly towards the middle, 
and since I tended to organize spells by whole sheets (as in, page 1, 
begin main, page 5 begin buffs, page 9, begin transportation, page 13 
begin general purpose utility, etc), I was running out of book pretty 
quick.
