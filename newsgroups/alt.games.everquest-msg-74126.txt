Very well qualified, m'lud ;) The proposition rests I take it ;)

One other thing that *might* be worth doing is heading around the
areas for the ghoulbane quest and bribing higher levels 10-15pp at
each point to help you do it. I dont know what your servers like but
I've found folk favourable to the idea of helping someone out who
is willing to pay what *for them* is a lot of cash when it indicates
the help isnt taken for granted.

Good luck whatever you do ;) Banded is probably the most sensible
suggestion though ;)
