Same thing for me. EQinfo shows under status "We are aware of the connection
problems and they are being looked into". The exact same thing happened this
morning about 9:00am our time, here in Utah. Everybody was booted for about
10 minutes.

Doesn't look like all the servers were hit this time though, some are
showing a couple thousand people on them, but mine (Seventh Hammer) shows
just 4 people :)
