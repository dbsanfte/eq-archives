I'm not sure how well this will work for you, but as a 59 Druid, when
I want money, I go hit 2 or 3 spots.

My 1st spot isn't a given. In fact, I've only made cash there once out
of about 5 tries, but I made 9K that time, so It's worth visiting! The
Dragon Nec entrance from WW has phase spiders haunting it.
Occasionally (ok... rarely) they'll drop a carapace. I sold it quick
in the bazaar for 9K, but it can go as high as 15K on my server.
(Morrell Thule)

My 2nd place is good for about 1K per KEI. It's the Giant Fort in
Burning woods. Just grind out kills there.

My 3rd spot in Wyverns in Cobalt Scar. They drop a lot of gems and
their hides can go for as much as 150p each. 

Oh, and Velium hounds in WW have pelts that sell for 300p each.

Hope this helps a little! You can also try to get the Gornit camp in
OOT. That's a HG on a 6 minute timer that drops nice plat.
