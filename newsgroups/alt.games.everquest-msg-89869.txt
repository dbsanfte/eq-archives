That's my warrior's lot in life. I am most *always* the last one out the
door when we're running for it. (Assuming we're not evaccing out.) Fact
is, I can just take the beating a lot longer, and being a Troll, I'm
usually blocking the door for the small folks if I try to go first.
Besides, the first one we're hustling out of there is the one who's
going to be rezzing my ass if my "brave last stand" truly turns into a
"last" stand. (Far too often, sadly. *sigh*.)
