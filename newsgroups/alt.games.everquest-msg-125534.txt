I just used my account key verant sent me to set up a second acct. on a
seperate computer. I have them both running on router, two monitors, etc.
However, I used the same login name and password altho I belive I checked
new account while setting it up. Now I can only access one at a time . I
don't know what to do <I e-mailed verant but I hope I didn't mess myself up
too bad. Its like eq thinks I am running the same account with two different
account keys.
