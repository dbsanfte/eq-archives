Serious Quick Question:  Why doesn't this NG want anyone to post in HTML?  I
think I remember hearing something about people not being able to read the
HTML, yet that makes me wonder "who" can't read it and why?  I ask this
because 1. The FAQ would be so much easier to post/use 2. Through Google one
can read HTML. 3. Through Netscape, Outlook Express, and the old Internet
Mail Program can read HTML posts. (which makes me curious who cant read it)
