I've got four years into EQ, I will be quitting shortly and will try EQ2 at
its launch. My son and I will each get an account. He's been following the
development closely and is quite fired up about the game.

Me, I'm more just ready for some change. I like the overall EQ setting and
style very much, but if EQ2 turns out to be a dog we'll try WoW rather than
come back to EQ1. Just mostly have that been there/done that feeling
regarding EQ1. And from the population trend on my server the past six
months or so, it appears that I am far from alone.
