Hi There

<Snip>

>I'm sorry, but what exactly is "random ganking"?

<Snip>

It's arriving as a level 1 character straight from creating that 
character onto a PvP server. to find yourself in a large pile of bodies 
being choked by a spell in a single round. Then dying reappearing and 
dying 6 more times before being able to type in /quit fast enough for 
the server to recognise it before the screen freezes from death. All the 
time the attackers were laughing at how some of their victims were 
almost making it to the zone entrance tunnel before dying.

It's later on finding that one 30th level Ranger is using track to hunt 
and kill all those under 10 in the zone. Multiple times until those 
being hunted get fed up and leave. Bitching all the time that we are 
skinflints for not carrying tons of platinum. Then uses really foul 
language as everyone leaves 'For not playing the game'

It was the same high level characters killing NPC's that drop specific 
items for the newbie armour quests. So as to slow our ability to able to 
get the items for our starting armour then bragging about how it would 
keep us easier to kill for longer. They then killed the group I was in.

It was the only time I damaged an opponent. 6 characters average level 
5. We got one of our 2 attackers to 50% hit points before the last of us 
died. Another of their buddies was at the spawn point casting choke to 
stop us trying to rejoin the fight.

In the 1 week I tried a PvP server I was killed 82 times by Characters 
and 6 by NPC's. The lowest "opponent" I had was 23 the highest was 48 I 
was also killed by an (Anonymous) who threw a spell that took 60 points 
off at 1st hit then 55 per tick. I lasted 3 rounds.

So what was I. Was I an evil ogre being hunted by good characters. Well 
I was a Gnome Rogue being hunted by mainly elves and humans. I got to 
level 9 before I deleted him.

The final straw was 19 straight deaths in 1.5 hours of play.

What I saw on those servers were mainly a bunch of puerile retards who 
thought it was extremely funny to try and build a larger pile of dead 
1st level characters faster than the characters could /quit.

So I am very glad that they are there. I hope SOE builds a very large 
fence and keeps them there.

So what is 'random ganking'. It's a foul mouthed bully's idea of fun.
Yours
