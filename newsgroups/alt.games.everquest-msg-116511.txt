The main thing you need is more memory.  Upgrade to 512MB total.
Or more, of course, but 512MB is a really good amount for
running EQ.  Even 384MB is noticeably cramped compared to
running at 512.

Try that first, you may discover that your current
video card is good enough after you've got enough memory.

My 500MhZ, 512MB, crappy i810 video chipset computer runs EQ
better than my 850MhZ, 256MB, AGP ATI Pro 2000 system.
The memory seems to be the key.
