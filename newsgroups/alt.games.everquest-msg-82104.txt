Ok, update time.  Spent 45 minutes dueling with Mr. Shaman's pet, Dogdog.
Defense went up 10 pts!  Now at 95 iirc.
Offense up to 155
1hb (Dark Ember) is around 125.

A few more sessions like that and my AC will actually break 500.  :-)  Yeah, it
may be time to start working on better armor...

Thanks Beurlom (lurking Shaman)!
