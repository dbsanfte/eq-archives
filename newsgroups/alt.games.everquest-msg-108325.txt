Sounds to me like you don't quite understand the purpose of Wizards and
Necromancers.

Wizards are not typical damage dealers. Instead of dealing constant
back-stab like damage, they speed up pulls. A good Wizard will save an
Enchanter a -ton- of mana by burning off adds that a group might not
ordinarily be able to handle in an orderly fashion. The less your melees get
hit, the less mana your Cleric has to use healing.

Necromancers are really more of a utility class in groups, in my opinion. A
lot of their good spells are forbidden because it can confuse melees, harm
crowd control, or cause them to gain aggro and die. But Necros are good in
dungeons because of Darkness, Screaming Terror, Feign Death, Root, the
'Scent' spells (resistance debuffs), and that lovely rez that could just
possibly save a group from having to make a corpse run into dangerous
territory.

I think you feel threatened.

Does the fact that there is one casting class that doesn't need you
consistently make you feel a little inadequate?

Just in case anyone is wondering, I'm not a Necromancer... I just like to
think a lot about other classes.
