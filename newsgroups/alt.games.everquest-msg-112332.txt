Yes, that was a little *selective* as you put it, but my statement stands
the same.  PREFERENCE is going to be given to the $40/month subscribers,
which makes the next sentence that I, as you so put it, *selectively cut*,
really doesn't amount to a hill of beans.  IMHO it was just put in there to
*smooth* things over.
The fact remains, you fork over the big $$ and you will not have to wait in
line as opposed to others that have been paying for up to 3 years.
Is that clear enough for you now???
