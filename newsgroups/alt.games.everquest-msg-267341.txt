But anyone searching the newsgroup will find around a hundred thousand
posts that aren't labled, and that mainly apply to EQ1.  There's no way 
to go back as far as 5 years in order to change the posting habits of 
the past (just as there's no way to go back to the late 1910's and lable 
everything WWI)... so it might simplify your life to lable everything 
that -isn't- EQ1.

Course if what you mean is that both EQ1 and EQ2 should be used, thats 
not a terrible solution.
