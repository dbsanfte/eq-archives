Letter from Sony:
http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4171


"we've accelerated the rate at which people gain experience up to
level ten."

and
  
"Characters level nine and under who die will appear at their bind
point with all of their equipment intact."

Are both clearly aimed at reducing the number of new players who
start, become frustrated due to short attention span, and quit. It
seems to me that Sony hopes to get new players addicted as quickly as
possible.


"Experience gained in dungeons designed for players level 30 and under
will be increased."

Same as above, really. Just a way to encourage faster leveling so
people don't quit.


Most of the other changes listed actually seem reasonable, even good,
to me.

That's the key phrase - experienced player. Sony is gearing these
changes primarily at the new player (plus the experienced player who
wants to really power level an alt).

Just about everything in that letter from Sony points to a faster trip
from 1 to 60.
