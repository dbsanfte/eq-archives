I used to play EQ a few years ago. I stopped playing the game because it
became so repetitive and Boring. All I did was kill creatures and make
armor, and jewels.

It seems that the only point in the game was to LVL your char, but this gets
really boring. I started out thinking that when I hit a decent level the
game would change and i could do some quests etc. But at lvl 19 Their was
still the same Old Corpse Fetching Level Losing/Gaining. (and Infamous
SOWing and Continous Medding) I looked on the I-Net for quests I could do,
( I mean ones worth wild) and Wound up only doing 1 (that mug one) It seemed
like the only quest worth wild that i was ABLE to do. Iv Joined Many many
groups to ..guess what.... Camp/Fight spawn sites. Oh wait, forgot about the
taking turns thing. You know, when there are 5 groups camping the same site
for hours on end. And from what I experenced, Soloing is not an option.

So in general what Im asking is, How much has this game changed over the
past 2 years??? Is it basicly the same as I mentioned, (A gloryfied
repetitive chat room, with no real goal?)  Did they put in more
quests,goals, or reasons for playing??

The reason Im asking is because I just finished FFX for PS2 and am Itching
for a Role playing game of some sort. And I do remmber when I enjoyed this
game....ummmm I mean when I as Addicted to EQ years ago. I also noticed at
the Comp. store that there has been 2 upgrades you can buy for this game
since I played it last. Do these upgrades make it much better? I mean from
the repetitiveness?

Let me know,
Thanks in advance.




My Old Chars.
ZUGGY Shaman , Master Smith lvl 24 (banded this and that)
Enchanter lvl 16 Master Jewler (Enchanted Jewlery etc.)
And a few others I forgot about........
NOTE:  I did spend alot of time on skills, but the payoff was not worth the
time at all.
