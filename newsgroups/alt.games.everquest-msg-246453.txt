SOE, in an effort to combat artificial level inflation, in much the way
gambling was introduced to combat plat inflation, is simplifying epics for
the 2.0 release.

No long camping periods.

No pointless hunting for incredibly mundane items that are just plain hard
to find.

To receive you Epic 2.0 item when you have reached 65th level, just turn in
the heads of TWO other 65th level characters, not in your guild or on your
account.

These characters will NOT be resurrectable.

Darwinian selection will at this point become operative, and the new levels
above 65 will automatically trim themselves down.  Those who live to
max/tweak themselves can live in the 65+ realm, which will automatically
become PvP.  Those who enjoy the game for what it offers them can continue
to play without the level-god player-MOBs spoiling it for them...
