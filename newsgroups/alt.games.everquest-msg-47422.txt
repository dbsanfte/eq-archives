That actually sounded like my plan... This plain has changed now. I started 
an Enchanter. I think I'll be making jewelry.

I drop-twinked her last nigh with 5 plat. Man, I forgot how far five plat 
goes! I still have most of it :)

So now the plan is play the chanter from time to time, level as necessary 
to advance the tradeskill, and get me druid to give her Imbued Emeralds and 
make cultural jewelry for sale. This makes a LOT more sense for me, because 
jewelry is something newbies never have, so I can donate some of my 
practice pieces to goodwill :)
