   Hello again,

  Thanks to all that replied. There appears to be many options to handle
breathing underwater and the vacumes of Luclin. I apologize for not keeping
up with the quest items to reach my current level. My fellow guild members
have been giving me many hand me downs to make life a little easier but I've
never asked them for any particular item. One day I may ask them for some
assistance for a particular item. Till then I believe in doing my homework
first to be sure we all doing the right thing. A little research can go a
long way in a good rpg.

 What does STOF stand for?

< The only quested staff for wizards anymore, IMHO, is the SoTF which I
still carry at level 58.  I never bothered with that bulky Staff of the
Wheel. Just wasn't worth it for the stats at the time. jaZZ md "Because
