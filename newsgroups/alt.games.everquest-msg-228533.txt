Hi There

To save flooding the newsgroup with my replies and thanks I'll put it 
all here.

Thanks everyone for all the suggestions. I will try them all.

-------------- Thanks (Veteran Foxeye Vaeltaja, Ben Sisson & Moopy) 
---------------------

I must admit I haven't used flame lick for a lot of levels as I usually 
just upgraded to what I thought was the next flame attack in line.

Humm! overall it seems I seriously underestimated the utility of my 
older spells. I suppose I fell for the it's newer it must be better 
syndrome.

I didn't realise it that it had a dot component. Ah! well a fire beetle 
will have to lose an eye.

---------------------------- thanks ( Lief ) -----------------------

I always put on a full coat of thorns usually ends up as 11 on me and 7 
on the Main Tank. I even sometimes remember to cast the short lived one 
on me first. So I can see when to renew The MT's.

I hadn't thought about using a 2 handed sword I always assumed it gave 
less damage than 2 single handed swords with double attack.

Humm! As I'm down in Lower Guk at the moment looking for Slaythe the 
Slayer.

Getting the Ebony Blade Longsword is an option, as I already have Morins 
Short Sword. While I have been in Lower Guk getting faction, experience 
and roasted as an Entree by Wizards.
A kindly Shaman that put me back together pointed out that the minotaurs 
where the place holders for Slaythe and the one of them drops the Ebony 
Bladed Longsword.

--------------------- Thanks ( Moopy ) --------------------

I will try a hotkey with Taunt, Kick, Beg and Snare. I must admit to 
being lazy and having them as individuals. (Okay I'll admit it I still 
have a Sense Heading Button.)

One thing will the macro be

Taunt
Kick
Beg
/cast 8 (The 8th slot is where I keep snare)

Or

/Taunt
/Kick
/Beg
/Cast 8

I cannot seem to find the commands in the notes I have (Make mental note 
to update tatty old printout of manual that I made from the Kunark, 
Velious box set)

I always have basic haste with my Swiftclaw Sash. But I did see a Bard 
song during the dungeon with the same icon as you get from the 
enchanters spell. I must admit I never ask for buffs as I feel if the 
leader feels the party needs buffing he will request it. I do keep 4 
peridots to give to clerics if the they cast the symbol spell on me and 
after an enchanter told me that Rune spells take a gem I keep a few 
platinum for them as I can never remember which gem it is.

I do use the Call of the Sky spell that gives a 35 Proc. As well as my 
Wakazashi of the Frozen Sky which proc's for 81 but as my usual fully 
buffed, Tea and Food dex is 117 The proc is not going off  very often. 
 From analysis of the logs it's an average of 1.3 times per fight for the 
Wakazashi and 2.7 times per fight for the Call of the Sky.

Something else unusual from log analysis is that 35% of proc's are 
within 30 seconds of the spell ending and 40% are the next to last or 
last blow before the NPC dies, while 5% are both??

---------------------- Thanks ( Rumbledor )--------------------

I must admit I thought it was weird that both the cleric and bard went 
forward.

I did forget to say in my original post that the cleric was the leader. 
So I assumed at the time that he was leading from the front.

But as it was only my 3rd party I have been in with a bard and the first 
with a bard who did something other than manasong and heal I really 
didn't know what a bard was capable of doing as a pacifier / puller!

At the time I also assumed that the bard could only pacify one NPC so he 
was just saving the cleric mana. By doing a NPC while the Cleric did the 
others???

------------------ Hehe! (Shock) -------------------

Humm! wakes up and smells the coffee. Far better than machine oil <grin>

The main reason I was posting was to get advice on a dismal performance 
by myself in a new job. Which I thought would be a piece of cake <grin> 
(Over confidence will be your downfall. A piece of advice I must try one 
day <Big Grin>)

As well as get comments on the seeming invincibility of the NPC's to the 
lulls, calms or songs

Finally a snappy title always brings in people to read (Well sometimes) 
<Cheshire Cat>

------------------ Hehe! (Faned) ----------------

True I could be the anti-ranger. It might also be my size. The NPC's 
just don't see me.

As it is most Players seem fail to see me. Then quite happily sit on me, 
stand on me or walk through me while I am resting even when I am not 
trying to hide <grin>

Yours
