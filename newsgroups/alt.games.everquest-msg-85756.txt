It's more a matter of wis over 200 being less pointless than it used
to be. Instead of 1 mana per wis, you now get half as much mana per
wis over 200 as you do per wis under 200. 
Hence, it's not a matter of worrying about getting 255 but a matter of
NOT worrying about _having to_ get mana gear once you hit 200.
My current wis is 207 on most occasions, 222 if I put my ugly gear
(which I currently only do for tradeskill purposes) and I am
definitely paying more attention to AC and resists when I look for
upgrades. More wis won't help you a bit if you're never at full mana,
so just go ahead and wear your treeweave.
