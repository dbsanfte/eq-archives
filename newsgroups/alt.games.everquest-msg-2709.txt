YOu're not paying every month for the game, you're paying every month
for the service of using their servers. It just so happens that that's
the only way you can use the game. Point to observe, though: First
month is free. It's $10/month thereafter. If you get hooked in, it's
entirely possible it'll be a long time before you buy another game. In
my case, I've actually SAVED money this way...and I hear it's the same
with a LOT of others.

Only servers available are the pay servers offered by Sony. (Which, by
the way, there are nearly 20 or more of, dunno the exact number...)
