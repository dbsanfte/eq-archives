Come on you and I both know some of the "Extra Content"could have been
done with just a patch with no "extra cost" to the players. Now entire
land masses is another story, considering how long it takes a dial up
player to down load some patches , it would take forever to down load
a entire continent. So I guess if you want it you got to pay for it.

Personally, I think it would be impossible to play Old School EQ
without any expansions now a days. back in the day we had no choice,
it's all we had. But even if you did install old world only, all the
patches since then have balanced out the old world with the new
spells, resists, weapons,and items. This has made the old world
weapons almost obsolete. Hell, some new drops are way better than
epics. It would be a big time struggle to just play in the old world.
I think you would be in for a surprise if you tried to play old world
only.
