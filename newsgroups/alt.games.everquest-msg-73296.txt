No offense, but you brought that on yourself.

Anyone who wants a port in a "hurry" from me gets charged a premium,
and they pay up front. I also never port to a location unless I am
sure it is safe for me. (I always have snare, root, and gate memmed
when I port to a "hot LZ-landing zone")

I'm not greedy. I am always porting people for free when I am not busy
or I am planning on porting there myself. Porting a lowbie who died in
Kithicor running from Qeynos to FreePort is trivial. Porting to
dangerous zones is not. Be sure to charge accordingly and get payment
up front.

Some services are worth paying for. Anyone not willing to pay for
"special attention", should not get any.

Cheers
