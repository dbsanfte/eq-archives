Wow you guys are good....

Yeah 13 months down the drain here. No way I feel good about it, just
the only bright side I could come up with. 

Bard is a hoot. Hard enough to be a challenge and scare off the lazy
twinkers, versital enough to do damn near anything. Only draw back is
that many people have no idea what bards can do. Cant blame them
though, its taken me 45 levels to just begin to understand the class.
Maybe that isnt bad after all  :)  . Like I said whould have never
started it without the nerf, so bless your cold rotten hearts soe...
