	Sorry, you've mistaken me for a strawman.

	Outside of the caricatures of fundamentalists, atheists do not believe
that it is IMPOSSIBLE for gods to exist and they are CERTAIN there is no god.
Atheists just don't believe that gods exist, the same way you don't believe
there's an Invisible Pink Unicorn standing behind you right now.  We're well
aware of the provisional nature of knowledge, but since that's a constant it
hardly needs to be restated continually.

	If an all-powerful, all-knowing, universe-spanning entity (who is deeply
and personally concerned with my sex life) exists, I'm sure he could make his
existence known to me without much effort.  His girl could call my girl, we'd
talk, we'd do lunch, he could leave a message on my machine.
