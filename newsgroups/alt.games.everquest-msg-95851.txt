>Power Supply:	375-400 Watt (enough?)
374-400w should be more than enough for a P4 or AMD Athlon

>Case:		Mid-tower (Are they all the same?)
DON'T GET CHEAP ON THE CASE!
Good Cases are made by
Antec
Inwin
Enlight
SuperMicro

>MB/CPU: Need help here, thinking Intel P4-2Gig or so, I've seen

There is nothing wrong with AMD CPUs. If you have ever installed a
CPU/FAN, then you won't have any problems. Just pay attention to what
you are doing and make sure the fan is properly seated.

For the Intel P4 Look into the GigaByte P4 Titan DDR motherboard.
Here is a great review of P4 MBs using DDR Ram
http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.html?i=1567

>Memory: 768M-1G, but what kind?

DDR266
  
>Video:	GeForce4 4400/4600 as available

GF3-4 is fine, just be sure to get a 64MB model with DDR memory rated
at 3.6ns

>Disk Drive: 80Gig or so fast IDE, SCSI not worth the cost for me

Look for an ATA100/133 7200rpm EIDE drive with a 2mb cache buffer.
Maxtor makes a very good 7200rpm/2mb cache drive, and the IBM
Deckstars get outstanding reviews

>DVD:	Whatever is new and fairly cheap

Forget cheap (most DVDs run about the same price wise), and go for
quiet. Toshibas have a reputation for being running quietly. Do a
quick search on the web for reviews. Trust me nothing sucks worse than
trying to watch a movie on your PC with a noisey DVD player. You sit
much closer than you do whan on the couch watching with a TV/DVD.

>Sound:		No idea here, good luck with Turtle Beach in the past

Turtle Beach Santa Cruz 
Philips Acoustic Edge

>Display:	Either existing 19", maybe a new 21", or a 17" LCD?

Forget LCD. There is too much ghosting with fast movement. Especially
in games. Look for a monitor with a Sony Trinitron TFT picture tube.
This is a true flat CRT monitor. Go to your local TV retailer and
compare a Sony VVEGA to a normal TV, and you will see how superior the
picture quality of a TFT Triny is. The TFT is the best of both worlds
(CRT, LCD).

Alienware makes a nice gaming rig as does Falcon Northwest.

Use the custom build tools on their respective Web sites to get an
idea of what brands/components they are using (MB, RAM, Video, Sound,
Case, Etc) Both companies specialize in full-on gaming rigs, and the
parts they use will give you a clear indication as to compatibility,
stability, and performance when putting together your rig.

Skim through the forums at the following sites to get an idea of what
hardcore gamers are putting into thier systems.
