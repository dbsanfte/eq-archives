Not sure how much HP that'll give you at 34, but there is a huge, huge, 
HUGE difference between Allure of Death, and it's upgrade (at 34, 
obviously) of Call of Bones.  Enormously big.  And my HP atm really 
isn't cutting it.  Saving up for a shadel bandit ring atm, and a couple 
of other rings.  Problem is I don't really want to sell what I have 
because when I do tradeskilling, I want that int *back* ;p
