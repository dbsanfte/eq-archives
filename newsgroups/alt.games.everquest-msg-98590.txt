So, has anyone noticed a chilling effect on local auctions with the new 
chat channels?  I'm playing a newbie Rogue in Greater Faydark, and almost 
all of the auctions have moved over to a custom channel (buysell on 
Xegony).  While this is no big thing insofar as uber items go, I couldn't 
move any of the normal newbie economy items...batwings, bone chips, etc.  I 
can't really auction those on the global channel, but I kinda got the 
impression that nobody was listening on the local auction.

Anyone notice anything similar?
