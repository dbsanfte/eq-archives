In this regards, absolutely.  It was the point I was trying to make
earlier.  Once you log out, it's over.  It doesn't make me perform
worse at my job, or kick the dog, or yell at my children.  It's just a
game.

And yes, I get frustrated as well, but there are other things to do if
it gets to be more than a minor irritant.
