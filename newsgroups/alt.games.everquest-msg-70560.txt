In answer to your other subject, we're starting to hint a little louder now
that everyone needs to read the message board.

The one time that he commented on the message board he said he was too busy
with work to deal with reading boards.

The sponsor doesn't know him all that well, but we stand to gain at least 3
other high level good players if we fondle him a little (unbeknownst to him)
so they're afraid to say something.  The sponsor is a co-leader *sigh*.
It's a politics thing.

Personally, if I wouldn't get my nuts kicked in I'd tell him he needs to
read the boards; immediately and often.  As it is the strongest I could tell
my co-leaders is that I'd vote a Hell No if he doesn't bother reading the
boards.

It's been my viewpoint from the start, and no one's going to change my mind,
but a guild with poor out-of-game communication is a guild that sucks.
/Guildmotd just doesn't cut it...word-of-mouth doesn't cut it.  And damnit,
if you're (the recruit) not willing to keep in touch with what's
happening...if you require hand holding then you're wasting my time and get
the hell out of my way.  We chose an ezboard over a mailing list (not my
choice, but...).  Hell, I don't think this guy has even read my welcome mail
that I sent to him a week ago.  I think this because he hasn't answered my
question yet.
