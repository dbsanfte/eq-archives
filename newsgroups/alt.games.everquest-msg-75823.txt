Hehe, its normal. Seemed to cool of for a while, i even removed my /role 
because not 10 people in each zone begged any more, then i got to GFay, 
got 5 requests for PL in around 30 sec from zoning it.

The worst part is that im no better myself, when i do tailoring, i use 
the /who SHAMAN and /who ENCHANTER to get dex or cha buffs (no wis 
buffs, got enough wis, but need the dex, and occasionally a cha when 
buying 4 stacks of coldain velium temper). Only think i payed for the 
help 2 times, always offer 25-50pp as a donation since it increase my 
succes rate or lower my cost, so ill get a earning out of it.
Had a shammy wanted 50pp for dex buffs, and everyone in zone called him 
greedy, but hey, thats what i charge minimum for a port, why shouldt he 
earn a little too ;-). Also had a chanter cha buff me when i had to get 
my JC the last 30 points up for shawl quest, payed him 50pp since i 
would save a lot more, and he even stayed and dod JC too and kept 
throwing wis and cha buffs at me while he was there anyway.
