We have just released our newest game 'Rise of Myrmidon' as a beta.
http://www.battleatlantis.com/games/mud/
Description: Join forces with fellow adventurers in a persistent world
multiplayer game set in a troubled land. Where the evil Myrmidon, long
banished to a watery tomb, is plotting his return with one goal in
mind: the destruction of the world! Choose your character well --
Warrior, Mage, Cleric or Rogue -- and gain knowledge and skills by
exploring the land and defeating countless enemies. Gain treasure,
make friends and take sides. For if you side with goodness, you must
stop the rise of Myrmidon!

The game is now in beta. Let us know what you think!
