Here's the obvious reasons why I think the programers and the executive
decision makers are making poor decisions:

1. Rediculously high system requirements.
2. Only supports the latest version of DirectX -- no backwards
compatability, which makes most hardware made 1 or 2 years ago incompatable
with EQ.
3. Verant has a very large, very broad customer base, using many system
configurations, so a large number of customers will need to upgrade or
cancel their account.
4. The graphics aren't what make a cool game today. Especially an RPG --
it's the gameplay and the community. It's when you click on something,
you've targetted IT, not yourself!
5. The graphics aren't THAT great anyway -- I've seen 7 or 8 games that look
and play A LOT better than EQ under DirectX 7. Unfortunately, they can only
have up to 8 people playing in it at once.

I'd love to see the numbers on how many people cancelled their account, or
are just not playing anymore, because they don't know who to call to get
their account cancelled.. I bet it's close to 30% ... I don't know many
people that actually meet the system requirements...

I'd be suprised if Sony is making a profit from Verant. Anyone know if
Sony's anual report mentions Verant??
