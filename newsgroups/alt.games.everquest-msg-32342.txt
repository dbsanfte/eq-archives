This would be the way I'd go. If you got a TP to North Karana (or West
Karana if you're lucky, but the wrong end of it), you'd spend as much
time running through West Karana as you would swimming through Timorous
Deep to the firepot room. You can't get to Qeynos though - Halas is the
nearest firepot destination. Theres a list of where they all go at:

Or get a port to Tox and take the Erudin-Qeynos boat.
