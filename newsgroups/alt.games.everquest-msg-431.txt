Actually, I know of a guy who fell asleep at the keyboard in front of a 
Dervish camp -- while the rest of the party got killed -- and he was the 
leader!  I logged back in next day and walked up to the camp and started 
talking to him and he said he had been parked there for 6 hours on-line.  
amazing a wandering mummy or something did not wipe him out.

Lots of times people go away from the keyboard for a few hours even, 
though i'm not one of those types.
