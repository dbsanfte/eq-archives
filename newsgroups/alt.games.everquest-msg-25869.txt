    Doesn't mesh with my experiences. I levelled up in the newbie garden in
Paineel, didn't leave it until all the common mobs were green. At lower
levels I exclusively whacked skeletons and kobolds, the two mobs that had
coin, armour, weapons, and packs. Whenever I got full, I sold. Never ran out
of mobs, and was the FIRST character I've ever had that managed to buy all
her spells herself.
