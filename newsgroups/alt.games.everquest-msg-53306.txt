I have never once, been hostile, cursed, implied sexual content or directly
insulted someone in this game EVER!! I don't have a character name that is
racist, or hostile in anyway. I CANNOT FATHOM WHY MY ACCOUNT IS NOW
BANNED!!! I never received a warning, no letter, no verbal in the game,
NOTHING. This Gestapo like treatment of me is completely unfounded!!! I cant
believe this. TOP IT ALL OF being Sunday I will not hear from anyone till
tomorrow if at all!! Why would this happen
