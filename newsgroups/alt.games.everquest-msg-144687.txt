I don't think it was some kind of dystopian, ultra ridged, class based
system, although it might sound that way.  I do not feel that it was
an equitable system though.

More than likely it's just my upbringing.  Farmers and coal miners on
one side of the family and migrant farm workers on the other.  Both
are groups that didn't do well in the first half of the century.  

Interestingly enough, my immediate family 'escaped' those lives mainly
because of military service.  My father was in the Navy, and my mom's
dad was in the Army.  Has no bearing on the discussion, but I just
thought I'd mention it.  :-)

I think the problem is that unions tend to price themselves out of
work.  A fair wage is one thing, but sometimes wages get a bit out of
hand.  I'll concede right now that I get paid WAY to much for the work
I do.  $16/hour for semi-skilled (at best) labor is excessive.  Our
union wants wages like that, then decries businesses taking production
to Mexico where they can pay a fraction of that for the same work.

Not that I'm going to give the money back.

I don't have a problem with that.  That's a lawyer's job.  They have
to do it that way or people are being judged before they even get to
trial.  A guilty man should get the same level of defense that a
innocent man does because they aren't (in the eyes of the law) guilty
OR innocent until AFTER the trial.

Would you trust a lawyer to decide that you were innocent enough to
receive a full on defense?

And anyway, criminal lawyers I don't have a problem with really.  I
think that in places like a DA's and Public Defenders office are the
only places where you find lawyers who actually believe in what they
are doing.  I know a guy who is a PD and he is one of the most
frighteningly ernest people I've met.  There are those who are using
the jobs to pad out a resume, but I don't know what you can do about
that.

Now civil lawyers, they should be beaten.  Repeatedly.

Tobacco companies are a good example of why some government regulation

In all fairness, the military is a unique situation.  And it's
volunteer.  What kind of work options do you think there was for a 13
year old girl around the turn of the century?  They could leave the
sweatshop and go find a nice comfy white collar job?

More often than not, you find stuff like that in right to work states
with a strong union presence.  Companies that do NOT want a union have
to come up with creative benefits to attract employees from finding
work at higher paying union jobs.  IMHO that is.

We are agreeing on too much here.  Don't get me wrong, I LIKED

Hell, I'd rather give blood than money, and I HATE needles.  HATE.
All caps for a reason.

It was a poor example though, howabout Saint Mary's Food Bank here in
town?  They are always begging for food and always coming up short.

How much longer you in for?  Things are getting a little better.  I
might be biased as that I work for a telecom company.

Did he absolutely NEED the unemployment?  No, probably not.  But he
used it as a safety net.  I think having kids to support would make a
person be as careful about those things as they can.  And if that was
solely the type of person my tax money was going to help, I'd be
willing to pay more.

I wouldn't say the norm.  It's all to common.

One COULD argue that the rich don't pay the same proportionate amount
of taxes as the poor/middle class.  Hell, that's why I'm all for a
flat tax, practical or no.  :-)
