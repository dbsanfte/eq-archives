    One person recently cried on our server board that she'd mistaken her
Orb of the Infinite Void for sale for the Cone of the Mystics she also had
for sale, and ended up selling the Orb for 500 pp (the Cone apparently
didn't sell at 75 K). I have no idea what the person was thinking when I got
my recent "OMG" deal, but I have to admit my baby warrior is very happy with
her 1500 pp Chokdai Hide Pauldrons.
