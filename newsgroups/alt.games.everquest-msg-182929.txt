Like I said. Asking for compensation for the components would be justified. 
Denying a person buffs because you don't think they need them is just a bit 
pompous. Maybe they agree that they don't really need them to survive. 
Maybe they just prefer some insurance. Doesn't matter. They are a group 
mate and if they request buffs and are willing to pay for them, who are you 
to refuse?
