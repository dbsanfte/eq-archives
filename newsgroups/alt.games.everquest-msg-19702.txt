My impression was that he went in and tried to play 'normally' was
frustrated by all the bugs and decided to go on a 'Zippy the Pinhead'
flavored adventure. I am guilty of doing similar things when involved in a
long, boring camp (root a skellie in Befallen and attempt to have a
conversation on the merits of Cheez-Whiz) or try to convince a merchant you
are not a piece of talking refuse, etc.

Anyway, I thought it was funny.

But then again I thought 'Hudson Hawk' was funny.
