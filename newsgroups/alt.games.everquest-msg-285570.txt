Got my son's laptop running, and loaded EQ onto that, tested it with my 
account, but then opened a new one for him.

For the first time, we're able to play together, instead of sharing the 
single account.  Its certainly not an ideal gaming machine, but it is 
working fairly well, particularly since his favorite class is magician; 
it just so happens he's not as hurt by a little lag as would be a puller 
or healer class.

Another adjustment you may not have considered; I've long used the 
Viewport command to shrink down the visible EQ area on my screen, and 
moved the chat window, group window, so on and so forth all into the 
black area.  I do this because I really hate looking "thru" my chat 
window at the world, and because I like being able to click directly on 
objects in the world and in my various windows, without having to juggle 
them back and forth.

The view I have is similar to the "old school" GUI, which put the 
visible world in a frame.

But at any rate, this practice makes a big difference in running EQ on a 
low end system; when we first log in a new toon, the game is very 
choppy, issuing a viewport command clears up a lot of that problem, as 
its cutting down the world detail picture to less than half a "whole 
screen" approach.

/viewport 60 0 800 500

is the setting we've settled on, room for the spell bar to the left, 
chat windows underneath, targetting boxes and Effects over to the right.
