Early on in the game I decided that I only wanted my warrior to 1hs, thus
limiting my weapon using abilities.  Now, Ill be the first to admit that
this was pretty stupid, but I was just starting out then and really didnt
know any better.  Ive since decided that I want to learn at least 2hs and
if I have the time/patience 1hb and piercing.  Or am I overthinking this
and dont really *need* to raise these abilities

My question is geared toward the "higher-ups" as I am now level 37 (after
3 years [woot!] :).

Would any of you be opposed if a warrior approached you wanting to swing
at a mob to simply raise his weapon ability.  I realize that I wont get
any experience unless I somehow (magically) outdamage the group that
allows me to do this.  What is the general rule in this area?  I,
unfortunately wont be able to raise it by myself as my abilites in the
other weapons are VERY minimal and would not be able to produce enough
damage to kill anything.

Tought? Comments? etc?

Thanks in advance.
