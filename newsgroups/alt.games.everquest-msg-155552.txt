My girlf (54 twink monk) was whining last night about the nerf "crippling"
her soloability

I personally can't answer my opinions on it until I spend a few hours in a
regular place (e.g i could usually predict how many hp id lose, how long the
fight would take when killing in Velk/FG, after countless hours solid exping
in them), or when im pulling AoW/Tormax/Statue/Ssra mobs

I was in HS yesterday, a zone I rarely exp in, and thought I was taking more
damage, but I don't really have anything to compare it to (I just put it
down to paranoia) - I had to die (deliberatly) at one point and I did drop
in literally seconds.. I mean, as fast as you'd expect a cloth wearing
caster to drop.

That death time really (REALLY) pissed me off, because earlier in the night
in the HS group, a guildie rogue fell through the painting and had 4 mobs on
him, and killed 2 before he was at "critical" HP levels..  maybe the 4 mobs
on me were just more much more tougher, but the time difference was HUGE

My ultra fast death came right at the end of my playing though, so like I
said I need to test it more
