There aren't any *effective* ways to power-level in EQ2.
One can't buff or heal players who are engaged in combat
unless they're part of your group.   Group buffs - like SoW
or damage shields - drop when the player disbands.  All
you can really do is truly *babysit* -- if the player looks
like they'll die, they can /yell for help, and get healed.  But
then the mob doesn't give XP, so it's really just a way to
stop someone from dying if they have bad luck with the
RNG.
