You guys are playing on the wrong server or something. I only have two
players, a druid and necro, both very strong at solo'ing, but I don't
think a session goes by without at least one invite to group.  My
guild is also grouping constantly.  And last, there are always people
shouting lfg to hook up with.     If you want consistent groups,
conversation, I recommend you look for a guild.
