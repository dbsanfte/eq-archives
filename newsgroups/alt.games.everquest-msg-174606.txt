Lack of Love is like being starving hungry, the world ( if you haven't
figured it out by now ) is totally selfish hence the third world starves to
death ( they aren't loved big time ! ) 2 Tim 3 , look at the bigger picture.

Yes we are nearing the 42 months of AC , remember Jesus' Love on the cross
he died so you can goto heaven, may be we will have to get our heads cut of
to get to heaven Rev 20v4 but it will be worth it, the second you might be
killed the next second Jesus is sitting you down at a banquet Lk 12v37 , Mt
24. Endure patiently Rev 3v10 who knows you might be taken away from
trouble. ( In a perverse way even those terrorists that slammed in to WTC
were willing to die for what they believed in, where as the world are too
scared to even disposses a wicked killing tyrant like sdam )

"All that you can take, is all that you can't leave behind" ... "Your going
to a place that has to be believed to be seen" U2 , the world can't see the
love waiting in heaven
