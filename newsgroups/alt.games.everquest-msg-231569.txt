Conversation between me and A. Cretin, based on what I watched in my
rear-view mirror.

Me:  When you caught up with me back there, did you have any idea at
all that you were speeding in a playground zone?

A. Cretin:  Did I have any idea I was speeding in a playground zone?
Yeah.

Me:  So you knew you were speeding in a playground zone?

A. Cretin:  Yeah.

At that point I left.

/prayer:  Dear God, may I please have the unrestricted right to kill
people who really, really need it?  Or at least severely maim them?
Thank you.
