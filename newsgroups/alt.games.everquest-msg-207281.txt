 Well, I wont say South/East is impossible with that combo but it will
be challenging. I forgot what the HT on the undertakers are, but I think
it was like 800 or so. The hamals are wizards and like to cast Ice Comet
or whatever hits in the 1200 range. There are also a few areas that
really aren't single pullable so you'll need to be able to handle 2-3.

 Almost scared to find out.
