I've responded in other posts to what others have said, I'll add a little
bit here.

    I assume then that WIS gear with resists is a priority. ;-) I'll try and
point out some items. As I'm not a Zekker, I have no idea what things go for
on your server or if they're easy to get if in another team's "territory".
I've mentioned a few pieces of gear in the other threads - Kunzar Cloak,
Crystal Covered Shroud, Hollowed Bone Bracers - that give WIS/MANA and
resists. I'll name a few more here.

    Stick with the Orc Fangs - you get a lot of bang for the buck out of
them. Jasper rings should be a priority - easy to add quite a bit of WIS in
the finger slots.

    Again, go with the Shroud. Cold resist, STR, lightweight, and it blurs
what class you are to some extent.

    Shoulders: Bloodstained Mantle, short term. AC 6 STR 3 Sv. Magic 10.
Quite cheap, from Unrest - same mob that drops that Tunic you wanted, as a
matter of fact. ;-) Long term, Adamantine Epolets - AC 9 WIS 7. Those last a
character a long time, and yet will cost you surprisingly little.
    Waist: Thick Leather Apron. AC 8, only one pound, from Unrest. Of
course.
    Neck: Collar of Undead Protection. AC 5 Sv. Poison 7 Sv. Disease 7.
Drops in Upper Guk, very lightweight, very cheap. As you are a cleric of
Tunare, you may also want to start your Initiate Symbol quest:

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1252

    This item has WIS, leads to greater quests, can be done at your level,
and has a right-clickable self-only 10 Sv. Disease 10 Sv. Poison buff that
stacks with all your other buffs. ;-)

    Helm: Skull-Shaped Barbute. AC 13 HP 35 Sv. Magic 10. Sells quite
cheaply on the bluebie servers, 100 plat or less.
    Weapon: Sceptre of Flame. 7/29, MANA 15 Sv. Fire 5 Sv. Magic 5. Cheap on
a bluebie server.
    Hands:Splitpaw are campable by you, in South Karana, soon. 2 WIS, low
AC.
    Feet: your cleric Temple of Sol Ro quest boots, Boots of the Reliant. AC
11 Sv. Disease 6, all you require for these is to pick up two ground spawns,
run around a little, and have an enchanted platinum bar (100 pp).

    Assuming you can slowly accumulate some of these items, you should have
a very nice resist set on items with solid AC and a baseline of WIS/MANA.
Any PvPers know how easy it would be to gather these items on Tallon?
