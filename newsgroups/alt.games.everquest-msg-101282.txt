I think I know what's going on here.  If you look it up on Allakhazam's it
does come up as LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM under their description, but if you go
down a little ways and see the actual picture of the Centi Sword they show
from the in game picture you get when right clicking on the item it isn't
LORE.   It also says to the side under the where found:  New swords are now
LORE
OK, so if they are saying the new swords are lore then why don't the show a
picture of the lore version?
