   I'm not saying that everyone should scream bloody murder if the launch
doesn't go perfectly.  In fact, I would be kinda surprised if it did.  I
think I remember reading that EQLive's launch was a little rocky (can
anyone confirm?) and in time this grew to be what I consider to be one of
the best MMORPG's on the market.  CoH's launch was very smooth, and I am
hoping that EQII's matches this, but I don't have great hope on that.

   I will agree that there is good bitching and bad bitching.  Coming in
here crying because one got killed by a loom isn't really going to be
adding alot of insight to the game.  But if launch is so bad that a
majority of players cannot maneuver into place to kill a bat, then yeah,
they have every right to complain about it.  Fifty dollars, (and I am
assuming that the purchase price is going to be close to this) should
deliver at the very least a playable game.  

  If SoE cannot deliver that expectation for my 50 bucks, you can bet I'm
going to say something about it.


>Plus, I want the "I told
> you so." rights.

   More power to you, for that, I suppose.  If the launch is as rocky as
what I think some beta players are indicating it might be, then you might
be able to say that alot.  I hope it... um... enriches your life in the
manner you are expecting it too.

   Still, I hope you don't get to say it that much at all.  Maybe the
launch will be smooth.  It could happen!
