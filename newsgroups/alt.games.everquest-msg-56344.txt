oh, you can make much more impressive trains with AE fear. I remember I 
did that *once* in Guk. Group next to us trained us for the 4th time, 
and the druid needed a few seconds to cast evac. So I hit fear and had 
about 8 mobs run like hell, and 2 others turn on me. Then they and their 
buddies came for the train puller after we evacced.
Fun stuff
