I'm not sure, i'll have to try it again. I may well have had a few
lightstones in my inv. I'll try it again with just one greater and
also try the lightglobe spells. The main halls are fairly well lit but
this is not from your own lighting source. Once you move into the
little passageways it's extremely dark. The tunnels are only like 10
feet in diameter, surely a lightsource should light up your immediate
area, but it doesn't seem to.
