If you were to go to the official website, and look up the Firiona Vie
Server Rules, you would find the answer to your question.  I'll repeat it
here however.  You are level limited to Level*5+5 in learning languages.
You are also limited to one increase per hour.  From the sound of things,
the one increase per hour limitation may not be in effect, but the level
limit is.
