I don't think it would be the unlimate powerlevelling tool if it were
handled right.  I know you used your figure of  800 thousand platinum and
change to illustrate a point, but consider that it would likely be easier
for a person or people to power level someone to 49 than to scrape that kind
of cash together.  Anyway, it seems it would be possible (although I'm not
sure this idea doesn't create more problems than it solves) to have an item
get a semi-permenant tag when first looted.  It would be associated with the
person who looted it, and only they could get exp for turning it in.
Otherwise the god might say something like, "This item was never yours to
give."  Of course, cash donations would be virtually impossible to regulate
this way, but something may be possible.

I don't really know, my idea here may not work either, or may be too hard to
implement into the game design, but it seems there's gotta some way of
making it work . . .
