Level 55 Bard here.

Is it possible for me to get a pick up group here (or in other Tier-2
zones) or should I not waste my time?  I know a Shaman who was able to
get a group at 56 but that's possibly because of his slowing and
hasting abilities.  He's already at level 60.  This same Shaman also
mentioned that there are some frogs I could DoT kite in PoV that do
not summon.  Is this true?  Have any other bards here tried this?

I certainly can't complain about the soloing xp in PoD.  However, I
really enjoy grouping.  I've been grouping a lot in PoJ.  Of all the
PoP tier 1 zones, PoJ seems to be the easiest.

Also, this question will be a bit off subject butï¿½

What does PBAE stand for?  I can't figure out what the PB stands for.
