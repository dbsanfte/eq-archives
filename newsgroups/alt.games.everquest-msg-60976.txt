I did that for a while, but I developed a creepy Johnny Rotten stare because
I had trouble focussing unless things were close.  Basically, I ended up
nearsighted. . .the lenses I had had little microweights in them, so they
could try to correct the astigmatism.  They did alright, but I sure wouldn't
drive in them. . .

Also, my eyes are very, very dry.  I don't blink often enough.  Pain isn't
quite the word. . .
