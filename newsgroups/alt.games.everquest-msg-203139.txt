Actually, it just hides your race.  In a /w list, it replaces (Race) with
(Unknown)... everything else stays the same, like this:

[65 Archon] Plinkit (Unknown) <Uber and Uberer>

Level info should be unaffected.  Even if it was, though, to think that the
server end (which is what I hope handles things like buff restrictions)
could ever be forced to forget your level is rather frightening.

But since no one has confirmed this, the whole thing probably wasn't true to
begin with.  (I've been unable to play since I first heard about it.)
