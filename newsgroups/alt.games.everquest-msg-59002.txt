Hehe, yeah the Twisted Steel is a slow 2Her, but do you realize how
stupidly powerful that sword is?  :)

It was 33/35 making it decent.
They upgraded to something like 53/46 (don't remember exactly what the
stat was but it was on par with Guadralek).

It's a very powerful weapon and is the "mostly anyways" hedge in my
post.  I think it's possible for a warrior to cripple for over 800
with the new upgraded Twisted Steel.

Pretty fast.
In most exp grind zones against non-stupidly overpowered mobs (read
named mobs), the recycle is fast enough to get a two taunts off within
about 3 swings.

On my servers it's bloodpoints, VP swords, frostbringers etc...  Procs
like nothing.

The well equipped ones will have SoD.
