Okay, it sounds reasonable to me.

Part of the issue is that, for some of the classes (cleric, wizard, warrior,
magician) it's real obvious to all when you're being effective. For the
more subtle classes (enchanter, bard, shaman) though, it's hard to tell
how effective you are, and hard for others to tell too.

The other part has to do with my relative lack of EQ experience, and the
general cluelessness in pickup groups (Oasis, High Hold, WC). The last
several groups i've been in, it really didn't seem to matter *what* i did.
Between (IMO) poorly managed pets and "unwise" use of AE nukes, mez rarely
lasted 5 seconds. Or I'd root the mobs, but no one would move out of their
melee range. I've been relying lately on playing faux-shaman (slow mob/haste
tank) and using Charm as my only method of crowd control they can't screw
up. It felt like I *was* being effective when poking critters with my
Dragoon Dirk.

And yet, through luck or whatever, it didn't seem to matter. We all survived,
got xp and loot.  No one commented about my performance (or lack thereof).
Maybe most people have never grouped with enough *skilled* players to know
any better...
