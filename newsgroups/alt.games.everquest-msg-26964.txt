Wolf-form made my Tunare worshipping druid non-KOS in both places, so
getting a druid to wolf-form you may work. Then you can do some faction
quests. I've only tried Oggok, so:

Do the bread run - 2gp to Jarlen Meadowgreen the Centaur in SK gets you
a bag of bread loaves which you can give to Innkeep Gub in Feerott for
faction (obviously not much use if you can't port)

Hand in 4 lizard tails or 2 lizard dollies (from the lizardmen mystics)
to some SK in the Greenblood guild in Oggok. Raise greenblood faction
enough and you can also give lizard meat to the head SK guild master.
The tails can be handed in even with low faction (dubious is OK I
think).

Give 3 pickled frogloks (froglok meat + vinegar + jug of sauces) and
10gp to Chef Dooga.


Note these all raise Clurg faction, for the Stein of Moggok quest -
there are probably other ways if you just want to raise Bouncer faction
or something, but I was trying to do the stein quest - once you can do
that, a few stein runs make you golden in Oggok.

Obviously, finding a high enough level druid in Oggok to wolf-form you
every time you show up with your latest 4 lizard tails (they don't
stack) is going to be the sticking point...
