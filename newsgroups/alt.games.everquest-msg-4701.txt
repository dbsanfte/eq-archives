Ranger is pretty good choice for a starter.  The tracking feature will
releive a lot of the early frustration of the game, you can melee
perfectly well, most of your equipment is dirt cheap (well, it will be
by the time you start actually needing it, anyway), and around the
time you get spells (at level nine), you'll have a pretty good grasp
on the basics of the game.  After playing around with spellcasting for
a bit, you might want to try making a newbie druid or shaman or
wizard, and get a handle on that end of the game.

Just don't start off as a Human, Erudite, or Barbarian anything.
Night blindess is a very frustrating thing to have to deal with.
