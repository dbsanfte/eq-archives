Me too. I made 49 on a friday, I was 51 that sunday night, and went to a
party saturdaynight as well :)

But I must say I had some amazing groups in Velks with constant mobs (and I
mean constant, a chanter was pulling and had at least 2 mobs lined up for
slaughter for >hours<). The other group was in CY/Fake Wall with no top
group and only 1 bottom group, and our group had 2 monks and a rogue...
