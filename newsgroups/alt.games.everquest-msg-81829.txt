Oh wow! That's great! :) I didn't have the Commodore PET, I only had the
64... and when I think of that, I am still astounded when I compare memory
from those "early" days and today... of course, my ex husband got his BS in
Mathematics from Georgia Tech, some 35 years ago, his MS in CS from Chapel
Hill and his PhD as well... and was always telling me about having to feed
the cards into the computer :) I think he thinks his Dell laptop is much
more of a godsend :) (and yeah, I'm a fool for an intelligent man!)

Hmm... it works, but can you play EQ on it? ;) (just kidding)

thanks for the blast from the past!
Dark
