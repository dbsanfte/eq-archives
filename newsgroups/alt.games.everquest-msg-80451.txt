Nonsense - that's what the Training Studio is for.  I'm constantly answering
questions from newbie rogues there.  Just be sure to read the FAQ at the top

patience for newcomers who can't be bothered to at least read the FAQ.

I've been having lots of connectivity problems in the last few days, too.  I
found my Zonealarm had gotten corrupted.  Uninstalled it, but it's not 100%
fixed.  :-/
