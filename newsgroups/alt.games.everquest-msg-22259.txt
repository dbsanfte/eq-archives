 Well I guess I'll just continue to live in my fantasy world where no
class truly 'sucks' and we all have fun on raids. Some people play the
game to have fun not just to be the threee required classes on a raid
with the least amount of people possible.

 I've survived lots of times on 'big' raids when the only healer in my
group was a shaman. Would I prefer a cleric? Yes. You don't always have
that luxury though.

 I don't hear any of our shaman complaining. I guess they must be having
fun in their meaningless buff monkey role.

 While I don't think it's that bad I wont really disagree either. On
large SoV encounters Shamans and Enchanters don't really have a lot to
do in combat. I'm still glad they showed up though. I play a monk and
after Kunark we became less useful. However I'm having fun and I don't
really care if Rogues do more damage and Warriors can take more damage.
