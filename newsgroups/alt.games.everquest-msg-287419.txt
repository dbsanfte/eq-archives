By far.

some points:
1)No death penalty to speak of - its more like evac in EQ1.
2)One can flee from monsters,they stop chasing after a short distance.
3)Any class can solo almost anything.
4)Any class can easily solo its way to max level/AA.
5)Cheap crafted armour available from the beginning which makes
most looted stuff pale.

Well,not everything is easier,at least the interface gives you a hard
time,but hey,there are golden frames around the windows.

All in all its more for the lamer,err,excuse me the casual,gamer.
Strange enough,the message boards at Station.com are even more
filled up with whiner posts complaining about longish camps of 2 hours
(I am not exaggerating) and "slow" xp gain (made 35 in 2 weeks
with my first char,most of this time was spent fighting the
interface).

All in all I recommened it if one is the kind of person who gets
satisfaction from getting everything handed on a silver plate
without any effort.  ;)
