Yes, its no drop.

I have a druid that I use to track the little
beasties all over the desert. I lead them back to
a safe place, kill them and then log in the necro
to loot them.

You may want to find a tracking class to help you
out. 

>3. What color is the Necromancer newbie armor, anyway? (The Freeport
>version, that is)

I haven't been able to log in for a few weeks, so
I can't say for certain, but I'm fairly sure the
robe is red.
