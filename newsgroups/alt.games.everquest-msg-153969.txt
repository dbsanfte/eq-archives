> Yet somehow I imagine you think your cable bill is just fine.

Considering I can download 10's of gigabytes each month for less than double
the cost of an EQ account with cable/adsl from many providers and that at
most an EQ user is going to consume less than 400mb each month I fail to see
how your point is relevant as my issue was with the value of the service.

Regardless of what is updated the traffic volume is already known this was
not in dispute.

I just love the way you jump to conclusions.  I work in corporate accounts
for a national carrier - a bundle of OC3 connections or larger is very
economical when we are talking about requirements of 400Mbits/sec.
Economies of scale are a wonderful thing.

I agree with you, they need to make a profit.  I think some of you guys have
become very defensive over the questions I was asking.  That's all I have to
say on the matter however thankyou to all the people here who were able to
offer some sound and genuine advice.  Happy questing!
