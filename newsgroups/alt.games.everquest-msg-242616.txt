What I like it for is the situations where the MT sees the mobs coming
and can pick the one the enchanter is not mezzing before they get
there. Also, it helps the non-MA melees when looking for the one the
MA chose. I don't mean so they can click to target - again, they
should be getting target via assist - but just so they see faster
which way to turn to get into melee range when the mob pack splits
up... in other words react faster. Both situations assume the mobs
coming are of two different types, though.

I like heal spam for one reason - it tells everyone that the heal is
coming and that adjusts how they react. Secondary healers, especialy,
appreciate it if they know they don't have to throw an emergency heal
in. While not strictly necessary I do think it adds to efficiency.

Other than that, though (and the MA assist call) I really don't want
to see any other macro at all.
