    I read that wisdom doesn't effect trade skillups in any noticeable way.

    I also spent 2-3k getting int gear for my tradeskilling enchanter and
have both seen and recorded EXCELLENT results from doing this. I highly
recommend getting your int up above 200 before spending anything on
ingredients.

Cheers,
James
