Does being charmed make you count as an NPC ?

I ask because yesterday my Beasty was wandering around in Upperguk and found
a Mob by the name of "An old Froglok" he was only a dark blue con and both
me and the pet were full health so I thought he would be an easy kill, well
to cut a long story short 45 minutes later I was fed up of trying to kill
him (kept mezzing me and the pet and regened back to full health) so I
started running.

I had about 7 or so adds following me and I got mezzed again, I thought I
was dead now, but to my surpise the froggy adds didnt jump me, they just
stood around for a while then headed back to the spawn points like I had
FD'ed.

Now either they really respect the fact that breaking mezz is a bad thing to
do and really p*ss*s off your enchanter or I no longer counted as a target.

I wander if for example Ranger Bob was under attack and Chanter Boris saw
this, could he challenge Ranger Bob to a duel, Mez Bob, and the mobs would
leave Bob alone ?
