You will not evade me, "Graefaxe" <Graefaxe@notmail.com>:

>2 plus 6 wis rings should run about 200pp each.  Forrest Loops (+3 wis,

Why buy Forest loops if you can get a pair of playermade +3 wis
earrings for 25 pp each? I consider the extra stats on FLoops window
dressing, especially for a level 29 without too much cash to spend -
they'd be better off buying the gold jasper earrings and trying to get
FLoops by hunting Forest giants in FM
(I'm seriously getting tired of people thinking of Floops as the Holy
Grail, recommending that new players buy them instead of the cheap
alternative that gives the exact same amount of + wis...)
