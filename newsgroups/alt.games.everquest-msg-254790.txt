Hi. I've played EQ for a bit in the past. But I want to start out
roleplaying my character this time. I am not very good so I am going to
start with the tutorial.

Can anyone help by pointing to things I can read that will help improve my
roleplaying experience?

Thanks so much peepL,
I'm Anscic on Firiona Vie
