Not at all. I just thought it was kind of funny that one of the devs
sent me a personal note about a feature suggestion within a day of you
posting that. :)

Most of the time, the dev response is "the bug is fixed." It's happened
two or three times now that bugs have been fixed within a week or two of
me filing bug reports with screenshots and other corroboration, but
these were well-known bugs that lots of people were annoyed about. It
could be that I was the only person who made a point to provide enough
information to demonstrate the bug, or it could be that they were aware
of it and trying to fix it before I even filed. Who knows? I agree that
a fixed bug is definitely a sufficient response, and I don't really
expect a dev to respond personally.
