Our guild went from zero beastlords to 5 beastlords recently.

Since we had no beastlords at all, we took lower level ones than our normal
invites.

First one was level 52 on invite, which occured sometime around October.  He's
65 now and was some time before I was, despite playing less often than I do, and
raiding a lot.

He has some trouble getting groups, since noone really knows what a beastlord
can do.  Whenever possible, I get him into my groups; he's amazingly powerful,
particulary when you consider that he's woefully underequipped, a non-twinked
first character who's spent literally a couple months going from 50 to 65, he's
not even close to his full potential yet.
