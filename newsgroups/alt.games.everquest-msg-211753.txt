	No.  He can't.  Only when he's using Defensive, and you don't have
Defensive in every fight.

	Of course, you'll only be taking damage if you're holding agro, and
Warriors don't hold agro as well as knights.

	Actually, they don't.  The experience gained from taking on a single
target like that does not warrant the extra downtime.

	Obviously you don't know what it means to work in a good group.  Good
groups do not HAVE a "recharge" time.  You pull and fight continuously.
