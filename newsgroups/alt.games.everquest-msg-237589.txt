I have had a smiliar problem ( the first one you mentioned ). I believe in
my case at least it's a bit of a glitch in EQ that appears to happen with
some video cards. What seems to happen is that the memory on the card isn't
cleared properly by the game and from time to time it fouls up performance.
People often assume that packet loss can only be a connection problem but
this isn't actually the case. If your machine is struggling for some reason
( like poor video performance ) you can drop packets and basically get a bad
connection as a result.

Try this. I'm curious if it works. It works very nicely for me, and for a
few other people I know.
When things start to turn to porridge, go into the graphics settings under
options, select video modes and change to a different screen resolution.
After it changes, hit "cancel" to return to the old one. This invariably
brings me back down to zero packet loss, although I notice it happens less
anyway with my newer card which has more memory. The effect of the
resolution change and cancel seems to be to somehow reset whatever is being
cached or held on the card.

The last problem you mention though I'm not sure on, it could just have been
a bad day for your connection or ISP perhaps. Maybe it will be cleared up
the next time you try. I'm sure someone else here will have some ideas
anyway.
