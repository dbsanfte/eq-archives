Yeah...after my alt's guild combined with another smaller guild, we
used CoM to assimilate some of our groups (having folks from 35 to
60) to learn to fight together.  It's a great zone with good exp (and a bind
spot, for Bristlebane's sake!!!), which held a pretty decent level spread.

For the first 6 hours we were there, there was only a mage and a monk
duoing up front.
