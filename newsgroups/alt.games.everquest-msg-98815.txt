 For VP we've found (for us) that Bards really make the best pullers for
the Fab 4. Monk is good enough for Silverwing and Hoshkar but I can't
remember the last time we had anyone other than a Bard pulling the
others. 

 Really, though, it's situational for the most part.  Also don't forget
that Monks have Fast Feign as a class ability which at the top level
recycles FD 50% faster than normal. Monks Feign Death also isn't a spell
so you don't have mana or interrupt issues to deal with.
