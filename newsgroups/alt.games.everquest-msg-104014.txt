Hi all,
I figured before I hung up my necro I would ask you all for some help.
Although I am rather frustrated so this may not make much sense.
5 days ago I was soloing in Befallen with my newly lvl 11 Necro. I was
having a good time, had just killed a yellow con Skeleton Lorrd, and
inadvertantly backed up. As some of you may know, there is a well type thing
there, and I ended up falling down a floor or two. I survived the fall, but
was then whacked by all the high lvl stuff down there.
So, come today, I got over my anger at myself, and waded back in there.
So I entered Befallen, and cast the spell Gather Shadows on myself. I
checked to make sure it made me invis to undead as well (which it does) and
so jumped down the well again.
So I was feeling again, started going towards my corpse, when suddenly my
Gather Shadows disappears as an Ice Boned Skelly starts beating on me. I of
course die, as all the necros join in the fun.
So my question, is there anything I can do to get my body back? I know
Befallen isn't a popular place, so not many ppl are there.
Is there any reason my Gather Shadows faded? Will I have to get some super
high lvl to drag my corpse all the way out??
TIA
Chaos
