How in the world did you have that many practice points saved up?  Wizards
do ONE THING all the time...evoc.  I had to dump points in Abj to get my
damned shield to not chain fizzle (and then a boring hour casting the lowest
one over & over) then I had to dump points in Alt so my gate/ports wouldn't
fizzle (and then a boring hour...), then I had to dump a few points in Div
so that I could go invis when necessary. :p

I doubt if I have more than 20 pp available for training another skill.

It's ironic.  You summon a familiar for mana regen and fewer fizzles...but
it takes the average level 29 wizard a MINIMUM of 2 full mana bars to cast
him.

(and I think they still suicide when you go invis though I haven't dared
test it out)
