Humor me for a minute, if you would, and tell me how you'd react to the
following hypothetical (but not unusual in any way) situation. (And this
goes through a couple of stages, so bear with me.) You and a full group
of very high level friends (say, 58 to 60) which includes a cleric who
doesn't have their epic yet, decide to go to Skyfire for some xp
grinding and spell drops. You show up, and the ranger in your guild
suddenly announces that Zordak Ragefire is on track.

Is your *first* reaction to do a /who and even check who and how many
folks are in the zone, or is it an immediate /gu HEY! RAGEFIRE IS UP!

Assume you move to the NE corner and now you in fact see that Rage is up
and not engaged. You also see a group of twenty or more people on the
hill above him who all happen to be in one or two guilds. (You don't
know it, but they have a group porting in now and a chanter who's LD
they are waiting for, but that's not known unless you ask, so it may not
impact your decision.) Let's just say you know that there's another full
group or two of your guildies online, including wizards, who can be
there as fast as the wizzies can mem Tishan's Reloc and cast it.

Would you bother with any sort of /ooc or maybe a /tell to the cleric in
the guild on the hill before asking the wizards to mobilize the group?
Or is it really just a race to see if you can engage with a smaller but
more powerful force before they can? For all you know, they may be
within seconds of pulling, or maybe they are VERY disorganized and it's
going to take them another ten or fifteen minutes. (Lower level guild
than yours.) What do you do?

If the other guild is *already* there with a cleric and also waiting for
Rage, then it's a very different scenario. Hopefully the two groups
would have had a chat beforehand and tried to work out a resolution as
to who should go. If not, then yes, it's a race and FIF get's it. But
then *BOTH* clerics *know* it's a race and have to do the best they can.

That's just bantering words. You don't want to call it "camping" in the
same way that you "camp" Frenzy, fine. But the principle remains the
same. It's how the parties involved handle it that distinguishes players
with class from abusive assholes.

In the end, it's still really VI's fault for fucking up the design of
this encounter so badly, but it's there... and much like Sleeper's
Tomb's design, the players now have to deal with it as best they can.
