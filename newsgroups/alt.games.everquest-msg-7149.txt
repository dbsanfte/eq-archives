Pretty sure you've hit on the problem there. You'll need to use
regular water (I believe the formal name is "flask of water"), not
bloodwater. You're not the first Iksar I've heard run into this
problem.

I've never played an Iksar, so I don't know what kind of shopping
barriers you run into. If you don't mind a little tedium, the Desert
Madmen in Ro usually drop the right kind of water.
