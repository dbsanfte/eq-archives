M3 T00!

When I was around level 19 or so, I discovered that I could easily solo the
basilisks in HG valley with my pet.  Great experience, and was just the
booster I needed to start playing the enchanter more often.

The fun thing was that after I'd been doing it for an hour or so, the hill
giants started getting more and more common.  People in the zone were
actually /shouting about the amazing number of hill giants.
