Damn, here jaZZ and I thought we had found a way to take our early morning 
drinking to new levels.  :)  Now if only those little chocolates with the 
liquor in them weren't so damn expensive.  
(Completely unrelated, off-topic tidbit.  You can buy chocolate 
shotglasses.  Makes anyone with a sweet tooth drink a lot more than they 
would normally.  Remember this for your next mixer, but red wine and 
chocolate together give nasty, evil hangovers, so stick to liquor.)
