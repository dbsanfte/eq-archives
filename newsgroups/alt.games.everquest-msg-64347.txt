Mine is a homebrewed machine with the following specs -

Gigabyte 7IEX4 MB  (piece of crap, but functional, for now)
AMD Duron 750, no O/C
320mb ram, mix and match companies (2x128, 1x64)
GeForce2 GTS Pro (64mb DDR)
Maxtor and Seagate HDD, 12.1 and 4.1, respectively.
SBPCI512 (poor man's live - lowest card with EAX)
Win98 first edition (best of the gaming OS's, IMO)

Not too concerned.  I could run it on this setup, and just deal with
it.  Just so happens a local shop has 256mb chips for $22, so will
pick up a pair of them  tomorrow, when I pick up SoL...
