A popular rationalization amongst financially challenged artists,
but a load of bunk never-the-less.  I especially like the smear
at the end, always helps to demonize those who don't share your
views, wouldn't you say?

Another cheesy rationalization.

Good for you, makes you substantially more morally honest than most who
hold your position.

Unworkable.  People have a long and well documented history of placing
little or no monetary value on anything they get for free. All you
would succeed in doing would be preventing those artists who are
capable of managing their financial affairs from doing so.  That'd be a
pretty piss-poor way of treating folks who are trying to make a living.

I'm not defending the recording industry, taken as a whole they're every
bit as parasitic as the US legal community.  But so far I've not seen
anything that offerred any hope of being better than the admittedly
flawed copyright system we have in place.
