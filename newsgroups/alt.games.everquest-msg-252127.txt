I'm trying to fish in the abysmal sea. I've been fishing since before Kunark
was released and have always hated the land shark thing, but usually by
stepping around, you can get a stable fishing spot. Not this time! I'm at
the ramp with the dark elf who is fishing, and all i get are land shark
messages. I've even tried sitting on the ramp in the water, with only the
top of my head clearing the water, and nothing around me but the sea, so all
I can say is these land sharks have scuba gear.

Has anyone else encountered this? I heard a rumour that fishing in this zone
had been too successful and so had been disabled?
