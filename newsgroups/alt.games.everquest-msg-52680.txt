"> this makes absolutely no difference


Sure it does, it is the same PnP everyone is touting in regards to the L Guk
reference. If PnP is going to work in your favor to get a camp from someone
taking 3 camps then it applies in this very same situation. VI does not
recognize anyone's "right" to camp a spawn. Just because you were sitting
there waiting for 4 hours for him to pop does not entitle you to the spawn,
no matter what you may think.
If you are going to evoke PnP in one instance then it applies in all
situations, not just the ones you want it to.
