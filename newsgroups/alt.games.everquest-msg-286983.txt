Err...i dunno, doesn't bother me. Do you mean "scale" in relation to
EQ1, or relative to itself? The zones are *huuuuge* but i never got
the feeling there was a scale issue. Maybe you're thinking qeynos?
There are a lot of buildings there, it can be sort of overwhelming.
Kelethin is spread out a lot more, it's less dense. Freeport is
ginormous, split into several zones. But they feel fine to me.
However, if you mean relative to EQ1, then yes the commonlands became
monstrous. 500 years is *not* enough time, geologically, for any of
the stuff that's happened to the world to happen. Look at all the
pangea~

Not perfect by any means. Sort of silly at times. Hell, mobs are
grouped by level, clustered together, almost in a set path you could
follow to non-stop play through all the levels of content offered by
the zone (this is true for most big, outdoor zones). EQ2 is just
*simple* EQ1, but it's fresh and that's where most  ex-EQ1 people
ended up (the ones that went to WoW are dead to me...).

I hear you. Again, silly stuff they did, and i'm not loving it the way
i loved EQ1. I'll probably get tired of the easy, value-less feel of
accomplishments, but for now it's actually something i look forward to
playing with my crew.
