Thanks for the replies. Got the key last night! Spawn must be totally
random, because she spawn after about 20 minutes this time. Off a Scholar.
Also the keyholder on the 3rd level - the enraged shadowbeast - had it's
spawn rate turned up from what someone told me. This seemed to be true. It
spawned about 5 times in the hour and a half I was waiting for other
groupmembers to get there. Thanks again!
