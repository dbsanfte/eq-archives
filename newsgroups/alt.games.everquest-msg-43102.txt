My Iksar Shadow Knight hit level 21 last night...(for the second time)

I am a member of a group of players whose characters range from level
19 through level 24.  Several races, several classes.

We have found the new zone "Stonebrunt Mountains" on Odus to be very
worthwhile...it also mimmicks the gaming experience on Kunark in the
"Over There" zone and the "Lake of Ill Omen".  For an Iksar, merchants
and trainers are not available anywhere nearby...however, as a worldly
Iksar, you find work-arounds for these problems no matter where you
are.

The "Over There" zone on Kunark is easily reached by swimming/boating
from the Oasis.  The raft from the "Docks" at the Oasis carry you to
the Ogre Outpost in the Timorous Deep.  You have to swim from the raft
around to the right-side of the large boulders before you reach the
Ogre Outpost...then climb out onto the rocks once you see the first
boat dock on the other side of the boulders.  Wait there until the
"Bloated Belly" arrives att he Ogre Outpost.  Swim to the Bloated
Belly and climb onboard using your awesome swimming skills to leap out
of the water onto the "deck".  Stay on the Bloated Belly until you
reach the "Over There" zone and then swim straight at the stone wall
that you will see toward shore.  ( KEEP TO THE LEFT OF THE WALL to
make landfall )
Once you hit the beach, turn left and run along the beach until you
hit the edge of the zone...then turn right and run along the zone
boundry until you find the entrance to "Warslicks Woods".  If you
remember, you can zone into Cabilis from Warslicks Woods and get bound
in your old hometown.

From Cabilis...you then have direct access to both the "Over There"
and the "Lake of Ill Omen" zones.
The travel time from Oasis to Cabilis by way of the "Over There" zone
is the fastest route I have found back and forth to Kunark from the
mainland.  It is very safe so long as you stay near zone boundries and
stay away from unfriendlies near boat docks.

The "Stonebrunt Mountains" zone is only accessable through "Paineel"
and "Warrens" on Odus.  You will have to get a port to "Toxxulia
Forest" then run south.  The entrance to the Erudite Necromancer zone,
"Paineel", is found directly south of the crystal bridge in Toxxulia
Forest.  Once inside Paineel, go left at the cliff...( DO NOT FALL OFF
THE CLIFF )  You will have to RUN past a couple of skeleton guards as
you enter the Erudite Necro newbie area...they will be green to you
and should leave you alone...there is another NPC above the entrance
who might aggro on you as you run through the entry-way...but don't
stop to ask him why if he does...run through the newbie area and veer
off to the right as you top over the hill in the middle of the
zone...you will see an entrance with broken pillars on each side of it
as you top the hill...run inside...down the steps...and go left at the
small bathing pool down another tunnel...you will zone into the
Warrens.

You will need a good map to get through the Warrens...and a good bit
of invisibility helps as well.

At the far end of Warrens you will zone into "Stonebrunt Mountains".

Good luck...and Safe Hunting.
