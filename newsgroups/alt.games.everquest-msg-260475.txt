What?  No one is going to mention jboots?  Have all the other movement
enhancers made jboots so uninteresting now that there are no longer jboot
nerf rumors?

BTW, there was a patch once that actually did nerf jboots in some zones.  I
spent an hour with my Wizard porting around and visiting various zones and
measuring them, and found that in some zones they were giving me normal
jboot speed (34% boost), and in some they were giving only 20%.  It was
definitely on a per-zone basis, for if I left a 20% zone and later came
back, they would still be 20% in that zone.  (Well, it may have been on a
per-zone-server basis.  That would make more sense...if the spell data for a
zone server got messed up, then we'd expect all zones handled by that server
to be messed up).
