Hmm. I was thinking about joining a group on another day, not right
then. Uncertain I wanted to. I was tired and about to log out. He
kept askig, and I said no. I was tired. I was logging out. While I
was replying, yet again, to one of his requests, my character got
attacked from behind.

Boring.

It depends on the mmorpg. I know that some players are jerks, some
are occasionaly jerks, and some are never jerks. Tanstaafl.

One of my characters hasn't been pestered by one group. They had
said welcome to the area that character is arrived in. They have
politely asked me questions. And replied to the questions I had.
Took no for my answer when I said I was tired and about to log out.
In other words, not jerks.

The two who apparently got the idea to let my character get jumped
form behind because I didn't want to group right then, didn't ask
politely, didn't strike up a conversation, and evidently had been
attacking monsters that showed red or white for them. Wanted another
character along to take the punishment for them. Both had swords, so
I presume they were warrior characters who kept going after big game
when they hadn't the hp to deal with it.
