At 34 the necro will just have got powerful new spells, and a new pet (I
think). Melee wise you would be able to best the pet eventually, but the
spells are as you predict gonna be a problem. You want to get MR PR and
DR up as much as you can - MR for the snare and PR DR for the dots. Even
so I think you will lose. Good luck =)
