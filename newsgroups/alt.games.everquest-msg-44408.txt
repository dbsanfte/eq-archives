I connect through a local ISP for free (friends with the owner) and use AOL's
$10 plan (if you use a different ISP to connect, instead of AOL, it's $10). I
realize that the $10 plan is actually a worse deal than the $23 that includes
connecting. I use it for email and newsgroups, though. I haven't had any luck
with free newsgroup hosts, $12 a month seems way too much to pay for an
exclusively-newsgroup host, and my local ISP doesn't have a newsgroup service.
Do you have any suggestions? I could really use them.
