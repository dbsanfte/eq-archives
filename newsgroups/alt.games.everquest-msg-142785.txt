    JBoots won't help much, since unless you went DE you have no snare and
our nukes are pretty slow-casting, but go for it. And as I'm proving with
Mandy, I can solo a warrior past 50.

    It's going to make XP solo preferrable to XP in a group. Right now, I
can solo shrooms in FG with Delores. Single pull with a nuke, then
chain-cast nukes while tanking the thing. At the end, CH myself, then med
for the next one. I'd have to be retarded to do this for long, though,
because I can make XP faster just by grabbing any old melee in the zone and
partnering with them.

    Without a Manastone, there's no reason for a sane cleric to solo. It's
miserably slow XP, to the point where just about any other activity
(tradeskills, alts, checking The Bazaar one more time) is a better use of
time. Would a Manastone open up new mobs to me? No, but that's not why I
said a cleric needs one to solo well. Sounds like you might be confusing
"soloing" with "farming". ;-)
