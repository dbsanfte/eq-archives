Yay!! another furfoot!!  =)

You might get the Crafted BP cheaper because theres less of market for the
small crafted and someone might just want to get rid of it badly (I got
lucky and got mine for 250PP !!)

Charred boots are nice, 6AC AGI +3 Sv Fire +5 Sv Poison +5, I got mine for
100pp, yeah, the AC is a bit low, but i like having the saves and AGI.

Good thing you have an SSB, I love mine!

In general, you should try to get crafted or bronze at least, except the
crafted helm, which is utter crap compared to the SSB.
