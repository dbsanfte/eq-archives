Paladins get to wear plate armor and cast spells too. They have as
much hp and ac as a warrior but can taunt more with spells. its hard
for warrior to keep aggro with a paladin taunting and nuking. Maybe
sony should make them a chainmail or leather class. Or maybe cloth
only.....if paladins are so brave then why dont they have hand to
hand? Warriors have swords and armor and paladins have swords and
armor and spells. maybe paladins just like to dance with men and
listen to Frankie goes to hollywood?
