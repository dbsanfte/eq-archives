There seems to be one quest, and one quest ONLY, that increases faction with
the Priests of Mischief, and that involves handing skins in to a cleric at
the back of the church.

You can use the illusion mask, but make certain you have a huge load of the
skins, because the illusion will fade once you cross a zone boundary. And if
you are a cleric, necro or shadow knight, or otherwise worship Innoruuk (I
believe that is the right one), forget even that: racial illusions will not
hide faction for worshipping an evil god.
