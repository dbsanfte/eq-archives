I did not know that.

Now, ask me if I care.

If you don't like your class, stop playing. If you don't like what the game
is doing to your class, stop playing. If your not having fun with your class
anymore (which is what you're implying with your "rant"), stop playing. It's
just that simple.

You remind me of those people who, if you give them a $10 bill, complain
that they wanted two $5's.
