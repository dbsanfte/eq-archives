So a Druid is effectively a slightly less powerful cleric, ranger, 
beastlord, shaman, enchanter, mage, wizard all rolled into one. This 
gives the Druid a big advantage in being able to fill the role of either 
of these classes in a group if one of these classes is missing... kind 
of like a jack of all caster trades, master of none. Druids should not 
be super uber at all!
