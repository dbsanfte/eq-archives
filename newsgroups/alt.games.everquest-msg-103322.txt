Yup.  Don't bother unless you haven't installed any expansions OR your
typing speed is less than 10wpm.  DNS is a great product but a memory hog.
EQ BEFORE Luclin was a memory hog.  Adding the two together and you get a
recipe for failure.

Yeah, it works.  But it's slow as hell.

There's other "voice recognition" products out that work better with EQ.
Microsoft's Game Voice is a better alternative but not all that great (it
can do commands...slowly, but it won't freely type for you).  Possibly a
better option (one I haven't tried, unlike the previous two) is
www.battlecommander.com.  It claims it uses a LOT less CPU than MS's product
(1% instead of 9%).  BC offers a free demo download.
