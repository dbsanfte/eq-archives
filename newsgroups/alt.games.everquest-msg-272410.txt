I have soloed about 70% of the time to level 21 so far in EQ2, I expect 
to continue soloing at a comparable rate.  I too, have a hard time 
understanding the people who are bitching so much about it being so solo 
unfriendly.  I do get more xp in a group, no question there, but, I have 
managed just fine soloing as well, including completing many quests solo.
