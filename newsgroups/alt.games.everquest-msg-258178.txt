Nope.  Frankly, I'm not entirely sure what happens with insurance
companies, because when I said that they always aware thing sto the person
who got rear-ended, I didn't know for sure. I really ought to talk to
them.

Fact is, this whole bit that "you have to give way if someone is merging
in front of you" has NOTHING to do with the law in this state.  If
anything it is due only to common practice and urban myth.

If you make a right turn on red and get rear-ended by oncoming traffic it
IS your own damned fault, because YOU did not have the right of way.  Do
you argue with that?  Do I now have to watch out at green lights because
someone from the intersecting street wants to squeeze in?

Well, the moving traffic has the right of way on a highway. That is the
law.  Figure it out.  Common practice is well and good, but it is not the
same thing as California Vehicle Code.
