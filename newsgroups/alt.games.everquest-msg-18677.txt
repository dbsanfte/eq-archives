Hi, I've got a young Half-Elf Bard that has just come into possesion of a
green silken drape that I figure I can sell for around 200pp. Can anyone
suggest to me what sort of armour (if any) I can/should get with that money?
I am not sure what sort of armour bards can handle, they all seem to end up
wearing this stuff that makes them look like power rangers, but I am guess
that stuff will be too rich for me right now....
Thanks.
