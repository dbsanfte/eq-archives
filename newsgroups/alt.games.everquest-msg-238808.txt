What, no Halfling?  :)

Seriously, the Dwarf brings excellent physical stats with a very good
wisdom, and excellent faction in most all non-evil areas.  Their
ultimate questable Symbol can summon beer :)  It's a cute item,
especially for roleplay.

The Froglok, although I've never played one, has good stats as well,
and great newbie quests that really help a new player along.  They
also have decent faction.

Dark Elves have the best night vision, a recommended Snare "click"
item they can quest for, and decent wisdom.  They do have subpar
physical stats, as well as faction issues in most of the old world.

Personally, I went with Halfling to be different, not too many around
that I saw.  They have decent stats all around, especially in the
dexterity and agility, and a 5% experience bonus.  No real problems
with them, although it's too bad they can only opt to worship
Bristlebane -- and I don't think they have Symbol quests as Dwarves
and Dark Elves do.

Take it and run.
