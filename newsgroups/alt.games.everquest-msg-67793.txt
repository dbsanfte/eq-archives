I did read and react to the content...but since content does depend upon 
context the fact you made a direct reply did make it look like you had
decided to go off on one at me....this is Usenet and frankly thats pretty

Given that it wasnt a reply to my post but general might I ask for
comments on the idea of splitting bind to two aspects....the corpse run
and the porting/gating options. Perhaps 2 spells needed, perhaps not.
