One question is, what *type* of ore do they convert to?  Another is, what
*size* of ore?  Remember that converting a FS weapon is equivalent to buying
ore for 5 to 6 plat a piece.  So, what type and what size are both important
considerations.

Oh, and do they convert to the same type, or different.

Oh, and do FS daggers turn into small pieces, while FS 2H Swords turn into
large bricks...?

Inquiring minds want to know.
