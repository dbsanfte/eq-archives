    Yes, but the gloves have AC 5, so you're looking at what classes have AC
15 or better gauntlets available with ease. For plate tanks I'd avoid the
Hand Wraps, but my rogue and monk use them and have more AC than they would
if they traded the Wraps for a FBSS and commonly available gloves (Seb
Scale/Ry'gorr for the rogue, Gem Inlaid for the monk).
