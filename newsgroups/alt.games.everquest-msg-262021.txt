He chewed through my 57 monks hits and took three wildfires, but if the
other corrupted were that easy, i would be happy. However, they put 2 epic
2.0 70 level mobs in the same place as the corrupted aquagoblin, so I'm not
quite sure how to proceed. Focus on getting a jade reaver i suppose. Pity
no-one sells them in bazaar but not much market nowadays i expect.

Even with max channelling the slightest underwater tap seems to interrupt
spells so i'm really loathing the underwater fights. I'm hoping to be able
to pull with my monk up to dry land and will work on an eb item for him.
Good monk eb items seem hard to find, but i can always endure having
something rubbishy in a slot for a while i suppose ;-)

It's funny how my druid eb item (lod shield) is just decent all round, ecept
for the agi negative, which plays havoc with my dwarf cleric ac.
