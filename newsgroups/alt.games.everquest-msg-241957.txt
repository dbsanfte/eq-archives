}Nonsense. I've always seen orc pawns with torches during the day.
}Nothing adjusts its inventory based on time of day.

Well, that's not quite entirely  true.  Nothing adjusts its inventory 
based on time of day without repopping, like the rogue guildmaster in 
gfay, who only has the crumpled piece of paper ready to be pickpocketed at 
certain times.  So theoretcially, if the orc pawns all depopped and 
repopped at 8am and 8pm, they could only have torches at night.  But they 
don't. :)
