I wouldn't get too worried about it. We've been having primetime downtime in
this neck of the woods ( Australia New Zealand etc ) about twice a week
recently. It's not ideal and I believe they could have potentially done a
better job at avoiding having to do it, but hey, that's life :)

I doubt they'll be doing credits for downtime anytime soon as I beleive they
make no guarantees of 24/7 service.
