I am a new EQ User (8th level Bard) and noticed that I have a lot of
keystrokes to perform, especially with changing songs, etc. and
thought that the Microsoft Strategic Commander may make gameplay a
little more fun and enjoyable instead to trying to peck the keys on
the keyboard.

I was wondering if anyone else is using the Microsoft Strategic
Commander to control their alter egos in EQ?  With the seemly
limitless (well 72) controls, seems you could add a lot of functions.

Has anyone created an EQ profile that works well, or comment on using
the Microsoft Strategic Commander to move or to "look" with the
movement aspect of the controller.

Any help with the set up of this controlled would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks

P.S. Anyone looking for a low level bard to help them out in a group
on the Veeshan Server?
