Hi,

playing on Solusek Ro, I now have a big problem. Is there a new random
generator for building up hits and strikes of creatures ?

Yesterday I played with my lvl 13 Shaman. He has about 250 AC and ATK. I was
stroke by a skeleton ( green to me, normally no problem ) but wasn�t able to
hit it. There was no possibility, even changing position and turn on/off
autoattack was not successful. The fight lasted nearly ten minutes ( because
I had to wait for mana ) and I only was able to win because of my spells. No
hit with melee ( Shaman has warhammer and a good skill in 1H Blunt ). And
the skel was able to hit me for about 25 hp sometimes ?!?

Then I tried on another creature ( green to me too ) and was slain.

I thought, ok, just start the game new. I did and had the same problems like
before, even with my other characters.

Are this problems common ? I can�t laugh about it anymore because it�s
frustrating not to be able to fight even "small" targets.

Can anyone help ?

Thanks

Christian
