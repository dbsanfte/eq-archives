Rouge [sic}, Beastlord, Bard, Shaman and warrior


-- 
For the cat is cryptic, and close to Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from
forgotten cities in Meroï¿½ and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle's
lords, and
        heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is
his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the
Sphinx, and
        remembers that which she hath forgotten.

         H.P. Lovecraft 
         "The Cats of Ulthar"
