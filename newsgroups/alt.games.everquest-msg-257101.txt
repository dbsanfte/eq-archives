Yup, opinions will differ, surely.  I personally haven't found much use 
for wizard stuns...  the casting time of the stun I generally find better 
used running away.  I still tend to stick one in one of those spare 
slots I ahve left, just in case I can find a use for it though.  And I 
don't mess with the damage shield, since getting hit is much worse for me 
than the mob, even with it up.  O'keil's Levity once an hour, then free up 
the slot. :)

But it's a valid point about evac.  Well, until we get exodus. :)

And one could make an argument for a rune-type thingy.  But again, I'd 
rather have an extra nuke up and just plan on not getting hit. :)
