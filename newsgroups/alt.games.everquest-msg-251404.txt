Agreed, except they made a portal in POK to gunthak ;)
Little things like that matter. This is a GOOD area for people who are
at the appropriate semi-mid levels, but dude to the fact you had to
run through the warrens and whatever or get a port to stonebrunt,
meant it was kind of irritating to get there compared with other
"direct" POK areas. 
I think this will really increase appropriate level traffic for LOY.

I agree, besides possibly soloing a duo would be good. I two box, but
I think the minimum LDON group is still 3 right? So two boxing really
doesn't help. Yeah, I could find one other person but the reason why I
two box is that it generally did not go well in LDON missions with
other people. If you could duo, I'd try a duo there when no one else
was around.
