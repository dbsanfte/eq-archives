Exactly. I've used the /pet sit down command exactly twice. And both
times it was when we were in a really tough fight with adds, and *both*
the pet and I were nearly dead and I was OOM and needed him back to max
HP as quickly as possible. Other than that, if I'm medding blind looking
at my spell book (man, I can NOT wait to get this charcter to 35) I want
old' Jabober's ass standing guard and getting the first swing at
anything coming to disrupt my meditation.

The question is, though, is this a bug in the pets? Or is it
intentionally designed that way to make the class a bit more
"challenging"? And more to the point, do I *really* want to know the
answer to that?
