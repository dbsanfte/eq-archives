I find it annoying to keep the raid window open, it's very large, or else
you can't see enough information to make it worth having open.

Stupid Druid!
Should've just told him to heal himself.  Else just keep battle-rezzing him
so he gets low hp agro and dies again, then apologize and say there was
nothing in camp when you clicked him... then do it again.  Dead druids tend
to have much trouble overnuking.  But hey, I must be skilled or something,
because every raid I've been on that hasn't wiped out totally, I haven't
died on, other than doing vindi, and everyone camping to clear agro, and
with 5 seconds left getting summoned by Gkrean(who we weren't even fighting)
to his spawn point and getting anally raped; thank god for suicidal level 1
ogres.
