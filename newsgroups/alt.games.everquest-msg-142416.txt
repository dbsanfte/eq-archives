uhh, that sounds a little low, actually...

remember that report claiming EQ had a bigger GDP than Bulgaria or

something like 1pp = 0.7cents (about 7 bucks per kpp), so $50 for 10k sounds
like the price is falling post-bazaar.

/em wonders about his chances of buying 30k to MQ xanthe/solstice ears...
/em checks available balance on his visa...
/em decides to pay off his new bed first :o)
