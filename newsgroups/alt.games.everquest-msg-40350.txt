Yeah being a high level hero you shouldn't be able to physically pick
up a bauble from some trivial creature. Yeah that REALLY helps the
fantasy along.

But they already are. And they will continue to be.

Except that no one has put up a realistic practical reason. And other
games don't have EQ's quest system or no drop and loot items either.

And the only solution which is fair to both sides is no TCC. The TCC
is inherently unfair to people who have high level characters. 
Low level characters will level from playing and be able to achieve
high level rewards but high level character players are screwed.

And TCC does nothing to achieve this.
