Assuming you're talking about Tallon Zek, there are three teams.

The shorties fall into one.  The Dark Elves, Iksars, trolls, and 
Ogres fall into another, and the lighties (as well as Erudites) fall
into a third.


In Gfay, where the wood and high elves start, the team wars take shape
mostly in the form of individuals PK'ing other individuals.  Sometimes
you'll see a group of shorties ambushing lighties at a zone entrance. 
I haven't seen it happen the other way where the lighties will ambush
shorties, but then being a lighty I probably wouldn't notice :P

It could just be my impression, but I think that the people that play
the shorty PKers are about 50% grief players that don't follow the PvP
unwritten rules (e.g. after you get killed, you loot your corpse and
leave the zone for at least an hour)  I've seen a lot of corpse
camping, and bind rushing which can be a real pain for players that
are just trying to level or have fun with the PvE elements of the
game.

As a young player, I'd say get out of Gfay as soon as possible.  Head
for safer hunting grounds away from shorty territory, like East
Commons.  There you are more likely to run into Ogres and Dark Elves,
but they don't seem quite as bent on PK'ing as the shorties.
