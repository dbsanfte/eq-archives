How in hell does "blackmail" enter into the equation here?
EQ is an RPG (sort of almost).  In an RPG the gamemaster provides
an assortment of risks and rewards for the players to deal with.
You're saying that when VI performs their function as gamemaster
they're engaging in blackmail?

The people "inhabiting" Velks like it because it's easy risk-free
AA experience for level 60s.  That is, they like it because they
get a reward for no risk.  So now the reward is being reduced.
