Well the guild and associates that I tend to do things with try to do those
things that we can as well as we can, provided said critters are in fact
alive when we want to try and do them with the numbers we have available
(~32).   Recently this has included killing TT for the first time, did
Ring of Fear in CT (which was fun and new but not a real "farm" gig),
got luck and had all of NToV up for the first time in months this past
sunday (see my post on RoV) and tried doing the Vulak event.  We've done
the Maiden's trial a few times and are thinking about doing the others.
Oh, also whacked Grummus for the first time a couple weeks ago.
Raid time is spent kinda 50/50ish between gear farming and "new" stuff.
New being either a) something we haven't yet tried or something we've tried
and had our collective asses handed to us in a hat with a maraschino cherry
on top, or b) something odd (Briarly things is what my guild calls 'em)
like Ring of Fear or the upcoming Hate's Fury thing.

Current gigs on the table are AD, Capring (heh we gonna die but it'll be fun),
some of the other named in Ssra (Cursed, Blood, AL, provided they are alive),
we have some folks keying up for VP which should be an amusing romp, still
enabling 7th Hammer access for some people to try doing 7th Hammer again, we
try some of the VT LDoN raids, I'm camping now the last doodad needed to
fire up the Captain event in Hate's Fury.  Lotsa stuff going on, even have
a mid 20s night group for giggles.
