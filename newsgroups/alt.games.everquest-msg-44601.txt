First time I ever saw the collapsing gate was with my Necro.  I was level
17 or 18 and killing Gargs on Undead Isle in the OOT.  I was about to log
off and needed to bank, so I though it would be cute to send my pet after
the
Specs then gate.

/pet attack
Wait until they kill the pet and head down the mountain.
Cast Gate.
Gate Collapses.
Gate doesn't recycle in time.
Necro Collapses.

That's what I deserved for trying to be cute, although the collapsing gate
thing was quite odd.
