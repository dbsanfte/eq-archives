I just want to know why the human male voice sounds like a gay Cary Elwes.  I wonder if
it's Brenlo. :->

The NEC talent DEFINETLY provided the coolest voice characterization.

It would be really neat if SoE dreamt up some easy, in-game method of installing voice
packs, which could be exchanged between PCs.  Kind of like a v-card, so that if you could
hear that PC's voice-tells, it would be in their voice.

Of course, if they did that it would only be a matter of minutes before you'd hear
SpongeBob and Gilligan and Cartman and Darth and Spock and Aragorn and Bill Murray voices.

Yup, I want to hear Dr. Venkmann yell out "Don't cross the streams!!" as the puller aggros
half of the Catacombs onto the camp.

Best regards,
