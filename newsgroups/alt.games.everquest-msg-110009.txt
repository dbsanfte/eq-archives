I do indeed strafe run... but Run 1 (which gets you the same speed, more or
less) is -far- easier, allowing free steering, shouting to zone, seeing where
you are going...

Also, Run 1 in combination with strafe means you can outrun mobs even
when somewhat injured, even though that slows you down.  Run 2 will
be better, Run 3 better still.  Why?  Because faster is always better.

I recall without fondness many a long and winding run to zone with
mobs frequently managing to catch up just enough for a swat or two,
with my group mates asking annoying "are you ok" questions and
speculating that I"m LD.  More than once I've actually died pausing
to tap out a quick "running" message, or to tap the TRAIN hotkey...
strafe is so minimally faster than the pursuit that any pause can be
fatal, as it may result in some stunning kicks that lock you in place
while the main body of the train arrives.
