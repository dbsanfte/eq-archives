    Are you allowed to cheat and make a rogue? The old world zones you
haven't explored in full, like Mistmoore, could be done with a PL'ed
Hide/Sneak bot.

> Grieg's End (most)

    The place is a hole, in terms of gameplay and decor. If you've seen the
way to Grieg/Servitor, and have killed Myral at the back entry, you've done
all that's worth doing there.

> Icewell Keep (most)

    What part are you missing, the underground tunnels? With SoE and Invis
you should be able to take a whirlwind tour (some things see through, but
not much and you can just run like hell/evac).

> Lower Guk (most)

    Again, what part are you missing? There's only one undead frog that
wanders live side, and the elemental that is KOS to all, so unless you hosed
that faction you could wander all of live side unscathed.

> Mistmoore Castle (to graveyard only)

    This is worth making a rogue alt to see. Very nice decor.

> Neriak 3rd Gate (zonein area only)
> Neriak Commons (half)
> Neriak Foreign Quarter (half)

    Make a newbie DE necro and look around. Again, it has some style to it
so worth seeing.

> Ogguk (zonein area only)

    You can make a newbie ogre, but this zone isn't as visually exciting as
others.

> Paineel (zonein & newbie area only)

    Worth exploring with a newbie erudite necro, or you could blow up a ton
of things in The Warrens and walk around unscathed.

> Doomfire, The Burning Lands (unexplored)

    When you get to the elemental planes you'll end up seeing a lot of them.
There's nameds everywhere, both static and random pop.

> Drunder, Fortress of Zek (zonein only, just got flagged)

    Tell me when you've seen the pig farmer. ;-)

> Halls of Honor  (parts, currently working on trials)

    Any one part of HoH looks like any other part. When you get to the
Temple of Marr, look very closely at the vases at zone-in and see if you can
find the picture where Mith Marr "pwns" someone.

> Plane of Time  (unexplored)

    You and everyone else in EQ!

> Plane of Torment (zonein only, VERY creepy)

    The tower Saryn lives in is neat, and the swallowed event (you'll know
when you do it) is also really nifty. The rest of the zone is a tremendous
waste. Zone sits empty most of the time because of how bad it is for XP and
loot.

> Ruins of Lxanvom (up to Bertoxx ring)

    Bertox ring is a lot of killing, not much in the way of scenery. It's
worth doing if only to see the intermediate bosses (AAAHHH! GIANT FLY!)

> Tower of Solusek Ro (unexplored)

    This is a very nicely done zone. Each of the five trials has its own
unique architecture and mob models, and the central area over the lake of
lava is breathtaking. If you can turn on graphics for a bit, it's even more
impressive as many mobs have flames coming off them. Even though nothing
drops that I'd really feel justified sending a tell to get, and no
tradeskill items drop that I'd use, I love going back to raid there.

    If you're as far along as you seem to be, don't count yourself out.
