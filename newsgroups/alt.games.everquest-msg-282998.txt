The "xp proportionate to their level" is a simplification.  I've
read that the formula actually distributes it based on level+5, i.e.,
if you add 5 to everybody's level, you'll get numbers whose relative
proportions match the proportions of the xp awards.  But that's
mostly in the noise, as witness it doesn't really affect the 15-18%
spread for the characters listed.

But Richard's analysis forgets that there's an xp bonus based on the
size of the group.  For a 3-group, the multiplier is 1.4, whereas
for a 6-group it's 2.16.  So that hypothetical mob that was worth
10000xp to the full group, would be worth only 6481xp to the smaller
group.  Dividing that among the bottom three toons yields from 2074
to 2268xp, which is higher than they would've gotten as part of the
group of six but is far short of the 3200-3500 shown above.

Could there be other factors dragging down the xp?  E.g., are any of
the lower level characters Iksar?  (I'm not sure which other races
suffer an xp penalty.)  Is anyone putting points into leadership xp?

The thing is, even though the lower levels get less xp than the
higher levels, the higher levels also need more xp to reach the next
level.  I'm not sure of the formula for xp per level (there's a
modifier that ratchets up every 5 levels, and I'm not sure what it
does after level 50), but a level 53 should need about 25-35% more xp
to ding than a level 47 does, and the level 53 is getting only about
11% more xp per kill than the level 47, so I'd expect the level 47's
xp bar to move faster.
