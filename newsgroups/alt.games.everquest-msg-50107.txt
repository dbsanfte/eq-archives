Tower of Frozen Shadow is a Cleric/Paladin's dream, in a lot of
ways.

Pathing of feared undead is predictable and (if done from
the right areas) doesn't go through other batches of mobs.

Level range is good, as is loot, generally.

I went there mostly at 50+, so I don't know how hard it
would be to single-pull at 43, but even if you get two or
three at a time, you ought to be able to juggle them with
Spook Undead.

If the first or second floor is still blue to you, you'd be in
great shape.  The third floor can be a bit stickier, but very
doable especially if you hang out by the "exit mirror" just
in case.

Forget the fourth floor, *everyone* hates the fourth floor.
Just about everything wanders, so swarms are a constant 
problem, and many mobs are *not* undead.

Fifth floor (wedding party) should be good.

My personal favorite is the sixth floor.  Easy pulls,
easy pathing, easy mobs, and plenty of "safe spots"
since there's not a single wandering mob anywhere
(which also means no unexpected "adds").

For that matter there are no wanderers on the first,
second, or fifth floors either.

Forget the second phase of the sixth floor, and
the seventh floor.  No way anyone could solo them
for long.

The only catch is getting to any floor above the
first three solo -- crossing the fourth floor solo
would be a major bitch.  People have sworn that
regular invisibility works on all mobs on that
floor, but that has *not* been my experience
on several occasions.

And of course you have to get keys to do each
floor transition, but I soloed my acquisition of
the keys to floors 2-4.  The rest of the keys
would be much, much harder to solo.

On top of it all, ToFS seems to have a reasonably
high zone experience multiplier, *and* is very
scenic.
