I was going to point that out too but I decided not to. I'm not here to 
mitigate bad news or opinions about EQ2, I think most people want to hear 
all sides of the story and judge for themselves whether it's interesting or 
not. So much of this is subjective and personal, I know that a lot of the 
stuff that I like won't be very appealing to someone else, and vice-versa. 
So I mostly try and keep my comments confined to talking about the stuff 
that I do like, and trying to provide some information. I like writing about 
the fun things that I find in the games that I play.

Of course, like anyone else who has passion about the stuff they like, I do 
get irked when I read negative posts about something I like and it's based 
on factually inaccurate information. In those cases I can't always help 
myself from responding. ;-)

So, one thing that had puzzled me about Dick's original posts, before he 
apologized: it baffled me why he was making some of the factually wrong 
statements (e.g., "There is no artisan bar") since he seemed familiar enough 
with the game that he must have been playing it. And then, after reading his 
wife's report and recognizing some of the same phrasing in his messages, it 
all made sense. Apparently she started playing in July and some of her 
comments seem to be based on old information that is either no longer 
accurate or has changed in more recent updates. It occurred to me that this 
was why he was stating incorrect information; some of it was just from an 
old source.

Yeah, that is one of the central complaints people make about EQ2's combat 
model. Contrast this with the artisan model that goes against the grain of 
every crafting system that ever came before it, provides little to no 
documentation on how it works, and then kills you when you try it. Heh, you 
can tell there were different folks at the head of these two separate 
designs.
