You've obviously had better experiences there than I. I have never seen 
groups allotted more than one room. Therefore, it winds up being a boring 
stand up and fight for 30 seconds and sit and med for 5 minutes affair. 
People have always horned in on one of the rooms if we were ever able to 
start with more than one. It's just too overcrowded there.

PC is the only other zone I have ever seen with such a high concentration 
of greed and selfishness, but at least PC has more mobs to go around.
