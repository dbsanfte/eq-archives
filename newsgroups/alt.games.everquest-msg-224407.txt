The more counters a spell has the harder it is to cure.  As you level
up you get better cure spells to combat this.  Cure Disease is fine
for curing Rabies in North Ro but is borderline worthless for curing
anything beyond that (eg: Walking Sleep the level 14 Shaman slow has 6
counters meaning you'd need six casts of Cure Disease to shift it.)
 
For example Remove Greater Curse goes for a small fortune in bazaar
because it removes most raid curses in one cast while you'd have to
chain cast Remove Curse over and over to get the same effect by which
time your tank is most likely dead.
