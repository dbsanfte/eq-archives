    This might be the heart of why I canceled from EQII.  I love playing
priest classes in EQL, but in EQII one seemed only useful in a group, or as
wandering rez machine.  The "not being able to heal people in an encounter
unless you are grouped with them" also is a deal killer for the way I like
to play.  In EQL, I've made friends by being willing to toss off a quick
heal at a critical moment for someone else.  In EQII, unless you are
grouped with someone, there really is no reason to talk to them at all. 
And I think this "no need to speak" mentality put a big damper on the
general chatter and conversations that I miss from EQL.

    Yeah, I could tell early on that I wasn't going to like this, either. 
It felt very artificial to me, much more an immersion breaker than the
instancists of the various zones.  Some guys tells me to kill 40 gnolls.  I
find a group of 3, kill 2, and run away from the 3.  The guy who gave me
the quest then says "Sure, you killed two, but you did let that third get
away.  I'm so upset about that that I'm not even going to count the two you
did kill!" 

    I felt cut off from other players from the very start because of the
game mechanics, and truly felt the constant immersion breaker of certain
game elements.  What finally pushed me over the edge was the "pay
exorbitant prices for more character slots, altaholics."  As I've said, I
know that MMORPGs are businesses, and they ought to be making a profit.  I
don't mind paying enough in my monthly sub to make that happen.  But when
they take the "gouge the players in any conceivable way" philosophy that
SOE so enthusiastically embraces.
