Nah that was from way back :) I only went to LOIO once. 
Character advancement is a problem because a) I don't 
seem to have the time everybody else has to play (well, 
how *else* do you explain leaving somebody one night and 
you're both level 9, and you log on the next night and 
they're level 13?) and b) I keep jumping from character 
to character.  On one server I have a rogue and a 
ranger.  On another server I have a shaman, a bard, an 
enchanter, a shadowknight, a monk, a mage, a ranger, a 
cleric... hmm... there are ten spots, right?  Anyway, I 
have all ten filled :)

Depends who I'm playing *g*  Right now my shaman has the 
highest tailoring skill and I'd like to start making 
some money with her.  So she's kinda been stuck doing 
the "kill for cash not for exp" thing.

No adds is good *g*  I think my main frustration is 
finding a good group.  The fact that everybody is 
advancing faster than me means I have to keep finding 
new groups, and it's *really* frustrating.  Of course 
everybody says that this is the worst time for pick-up 
groups, but.. that's about all I *can* do unless I quit 
my job and start playing only one character...  (I'd 
like to point out that yes I WOULD do that if it was at 
all feasible :D)

I HATE the werewolves.  Hate them.  Probably cause I 
died to one young. :)  But they'll pay.  Oh, how they'll 
pay...

Thanks for the advice.  Playing a ranger right now 
(oops... *updates sig file *again**) but I'm starting to 
feel the need to shift gears again *g* (although my poor 
little SK has been left alone WAY too long...)
