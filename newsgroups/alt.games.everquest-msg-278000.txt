My departure from Everquest came about the same way.  After having played 
since beta 4, I thought I would do something grand like make a sweep of the 
zones I leveled up in as a newbie or something, but the game had become so 
tedious I couldn't even stomach logging in anymore so I just cancelled all 
of my accounts and left it at that.
I think for me the magic was gone when the GoD expansion caused me to 
realize SoE's heart is in counting wads of cash and not in giving its 
customers a quality product.

I think its been 6 or so months since I last logged in and I haven't the 
slightest urge to pay any more $ to SoE.
