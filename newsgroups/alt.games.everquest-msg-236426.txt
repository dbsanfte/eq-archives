Hello )

I am having a little trouble with my graphics in EQ, my Vah Shir Beastlord,
has suddenly developed some odd problems... His head is now black, his tail
orange and his arms and hands are white.... only the graphics for his chest
and weapons are displayed...no others, yesterday..he was a black kitty
dressed in black and looking fine, now he looks like a half twinked newbie
=/

I petitioned, only to be told..NO IDEA! gasp! ...does anyone ...anywhere
have any idea what I can do to fix this.. or do I have to resort to a full
installation.../cry

Here's hoping!

Oakas 60 Beast, MT
