   You did a google search on me, that _that_ was the best you could do
to prove your point?  Nothing from alt.tasteless?  Nothing from
alt.sex.masturbation?  Just from here?  Believe me, I keep it tame in
this neighborhood... I don't think I've talked about vibrators even
once, here. Ok... your choice, I suppose. /shrug.

   Not me.  No building a pool, putting a ladder so they can get in and
out, telling them to get in, then removing the stepladder so they die
slowly of starvation and exhaustion as they dog-paddle about and have
fun in the sun.  *Looks innocent*
