They are REALLY slow. I just started a necromancer with my partner
who is playing an enchanter, and... well, we're dress up freaks. We're
level 10 and have about 7 robes each to play with (some of which
are the "ac 2 +1 mana variety" , but look pretty) and a horse each.

I know, I know, a horse at level 10, blah blah.

Anyway, they're just barely faster than normal run AND they are
slower for about the first 2 seconds making it hard to make a fast
exit from a crowd of mobs intent on stunning you.

However:

They look super pretty.

You med all the time while fighting and maneuvering.

They look super pretty.

I'm pretty sure you get "sit down" regen of HP too.

They look super pretty.

They impart a degree of safe fall

And, of course, they look super super pretty, especially when
you're a pair of dark elves, one on a white horse, one on a black
horse charging around with a skeletal pet ;)

When I can afford it I'll sell up and buy the "jboot" speed one,
but if you can only afford 9.5k (the cheapest) then your choices
are TBoots, much faster, no med/regen bonus, no safe fall, much
faster, last when you zone, 4.5k cheaper, or the horse. Which is
pretty. ;-)
