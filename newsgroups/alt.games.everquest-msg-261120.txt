Lol angry, spewing hate!  Is that a face saving way of saying "i made a
stupid remark, i cannot back it up, i cannot contest your replies, so im
just gonna kf you, and hope this thread goes away".

Im not angry, I never was angry. You made a stupid comment about a subject
that is dear to me, so yes I will debate passionately about it.  Maybe you
didnt realise, as a lurker, that making stupid unfounded comments (and then
replying, whilst ignoring the replies to disprove your silly claim) that
people would jump on you.  Welcome to Usenet.
