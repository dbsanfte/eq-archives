Why is it wrong to kill bankers?

Inconsiderate, maybe.. but illegal?

And where did VI state it was disruption?

Im not saying they didn't do it just to be asses.. but there are examples
where npc's/bankers are killed for legitimate reasons (e.g faction)..  kael
bank is a very common camp for exp, loot or faction..
