Yes they are.  Both you and the person turning in the bracer need to have
appropriate Coldain faction.  To be honest it has been a while since I did
any Velious armor, I know Skyshrine needs ally, but Coldain was less.  Have
the person with the bracer turn it into the monk armor guy first and then
you turn in the 3 gems.
