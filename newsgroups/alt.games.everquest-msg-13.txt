What items are those?

I assumed this was always the case, guess I'm not as screwed with
the giants as I thought I was!  Too bad I'm going to continue
playing Jack the Giant Killer in hopes of eventually getting to
non KOS with Wuoshi

Making it marginally more difficult for me to res you up quick and
throw you back into the line against that tough mob; as a cleric
I have the seldom used zing, but can't do anything about your speed.

Hey, something good for rangers!  Man do they need help.  More
please, from a RP standpoint I love rangers, but its hard to
see them as really functional members of a group when they
seem to contribute less than a warrior several levels lower, and
yet eat exp as a hybrid... or a warrior several levels highter.

Nice, again, the Hybrids need some help, and this should make
SK a little more attractive to groups.

High end stuff, but any boost to hybrids is good in my book

See above.

I love this, one of my big complaints about the game is how
much personal attention it takes to log out.  At this point I
tend to camp, and when I actually camp out, hit the computer
reset button.  Literally faster for my machine to reboot than
to wait for the character select, back out to the server select,
back out to the "are you sure" toggles...

I'm glad they preserved the normal camp to character select,
as I do also switch characters with some frequency.  Camp
to server select isn't all that interesting to me, I rarely move
from one server to another, although I suppose this would
make it marginally more interesting for me to try a character
on a PvP server.

Lol, wondered about that!

What size is zero?  Why isn't the current size in the middle of the
posible range?  I could get a flat screen monitor 40 inches on a
side, and pull the font down so tiny you'd still need a magnifying glass
to see it!
