Check the wolves/dogs in EK, if they are still blue they are a good way to
increase defense skills as they don't hit real hard and are easy to kill or
just fear away while you zone if needed.  As for the PB AOE they can come in
handy to wipe out a train of greenies in Blackburrow or if you can get a AOE
group together (picture 5 casters all doing AOE at same time to 30 low blue
MOB's).
