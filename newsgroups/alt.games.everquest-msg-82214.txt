Verant recommends installing the video and sound drivers after installing
DirectX.  That's what I did, and it works great for me.  Some people have
reported not needing to do that, some have reported that they had to do
that.  I don't recall hearing about anyone that had a problem as a result of
resinstalling video and sound after DX.
