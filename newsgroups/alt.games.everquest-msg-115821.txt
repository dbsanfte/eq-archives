Well, since 3pp is a lot closer to "nothing" than it is to "not very much", 
I'm not surprised that the Druid in question took it as if you were trying 
to have him.

In Fennin Ro, the going price for an old world port is 20pp, and between 30 
and 50pp from the expansions (I know it's exactly the same mana cost, but 
that seems to be the custom). If someone told me that they couldn't pay 
much, I would expect to be looking at 10 to 15 plat, not at 3pp, the same 
way I would not expect them to hand me Rusty Mace if they had offered me a 
trade for the port.
