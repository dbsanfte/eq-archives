At level 9, the best loot you can hunt for is the newbie cultural
armour quest stuff. Unfortunately that would mostly involve hunting
green mobs which give no experience.

If you go to Paludal Caverns on Luclin, you'll probably be level 15 in
a day or two (given that you're a troll, your regen should allow you
to solo if you can't find someone to group with). Somewhere about
15-17 you will be able to get groups at the bandit camps, which are
great exp and decent loot for a non-twink. A downside of Paludal is
that it tends to be full of morons complaining about how they
killsteal and train each other.

To get to the low level part of Paludal, you go to Shadeweaver's
Thicket, then north following the road until you get to the northern
end of the road, then in through the tunnel. In the tunnel you take
the first tunnel to the left, then the next two to the right. You'll
need to be careful about the big insects and shak dratha in the
tunnel, though, they'll attack you if you get close. There's a map at
http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadeweaversthicketmap.html.

Or you could go the spiderling hunting path, kill all spiderlings you
can find and sell the spiderling silk to players in the bazaar. That's
probably the best money you can do for a while, but it won't get you
levels because the spiderlings are too low level. But then once you
have a bit of cash you can start buying low and selling high in the
bazaar, which is how my level 30ish characters ended up twinked by a
level 14 wizard. :-)
