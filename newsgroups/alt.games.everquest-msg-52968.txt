Let me preface by saying, yes I do have a lowbie (level 20) cleric,
but didn't mention this.

Well, you can tell if someone is dispelling by watching the graphics.
If they aren't dispelling their pet, then you're not going to
reroot/blind it. Also, I'm not talking about doing BOTH root and
blind. It's one or the other, depending on the situation.

The pet is likely out of the picture at this point.

The druid didn't have the experience to step through it, then.

Unless I see the "You are stunned." message, then it's not a stun.

I play Rallos Zek, and have seen the difference between a cleric with
some PvP experience, and one without. We are obviously playing on two
very different servers. Let me also say, I have never been killed by a
caster with my cleric. This is because I know what I'm doing, have
some decent resists for level 20, and have experience. And yes, I've
fended off quite a few attackers with him.

I have absolutely no idea how many people on other servers can step
through a knockback-type spell. I don't know how many of them have
_ever_ PvPed. This is from my limited personal experience, and what I
have seen other (50+) clerics do.
