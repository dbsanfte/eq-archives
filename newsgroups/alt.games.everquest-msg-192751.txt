DT, you'll be happy to hear that this will be my final post. Just to
clear up a few points before I unsubscribe...

1. "*shrug* Still not happening to me. Quit whining, eh?" is not
criticism, it's uncalled for nastiness. Just because something is not
happening to you, does not mean that it's not happening to others who,
therefore, have a valid reason to complain. Would you tell a cancer
patient to quit whining simply because you don't have cancer so you
don't want to hear their complaints?

2. The crashing in the Bazaar problem that started 2 patches ago is a
problem of which Verant was well aware. A friend of mine is a guide and
he said it was a major complaint and that Verant was troubleshooting the
problem. It did indeed get fixed that time but cropped up again with
this last patch. It is not my computer or connection... nothing has
changed on my end and yet I never had this problem before (I always turn
off particle effects and clipping plane in the Bazaar so bard songs are
not to blame). And even if I didn't have confirmation that this was a
known problem, I'd have come to the conclusion that it cannot be
coincidence that this problem started happening to me the day after each
of the last two patches. 

3. My telling you I was female was done in a jokey manner which was an
attempt to get you to lighten up toward me (which I now realize was a
waste of effort). Did you realize that at all or did you just choose to
ignore it so that you could keep on being nasty?

4. I didn't just jump in and start posting. I read many posts and quite
a few were complaints (all valid ones I might add). Why you jumped all
over mine, calling it a misstep, and not theirs I don't know nor do I
care to stick around and find out.

To you DT I say, try being nice, you may even find you enjoy it!

To everyone else, hello and goodbye... Happy EQing!
