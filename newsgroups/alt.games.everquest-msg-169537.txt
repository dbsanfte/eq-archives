Well as you haven't explained what message you get but are on a Zek server,
let me take an educated guess that the channel had a password set by the
first person to use it after patch so until next server reset or that person
removes the password, no ones getting in.
Of course I could be wrong and it's something completely different, you
didn't exactly give to many details.
