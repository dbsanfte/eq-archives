I'm a DE Necro...never been this high LV with any other character before.
So I'm not completely sure which is a better idea to go with.
+INT +MANA
+INT +AC
+INT +HP
+INT +?

That's why I'm asking here.  I'm not sure what current prices are, and don't
want to buy something if something else better is slightly more.  I don't
have much.  I've got a decent robe (forgot name...it was 200pp, a blood red
color, has +INT with it).  I've got a +2 INT ring, and a +3 INT ring I got
from that GM event in WC few weeks ago.  Everything else is armor looted
from orc pawns.
