I said Usually.  in your case, no problem.  but I have been with Clerics
that would rather be in the frontline,fighting than healing and people have
died.  I gave teh cleric a warning after the first time, and his response
was "I can rez, what's your problem?"

my problem is the fact that it takes time to rez, rebuff, med to acceptable
level (which at high levels without crack can take easily 15 minutes) not to
mention the possibility of losing the spawn breakup, people while getting
back up to speed and all the time lost.  PLUS, WTF are we going to do if the
cleric pulls the aggro and no one can taunt it off?  hmm?  cleric dies, and
most likely the rest of the group soon after.

If you REALLY have the situation under control as in your case, FINE.  but
needless to say, the first cleric in the zone taht was LFG was added to our
group, and the halfwit "tank-cleric" was booted.
