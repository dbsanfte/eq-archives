I'm on the Combine server, so Dulak won't be an option for a while yet, 
whenever they open up the LOY expansion.

Whats Comatose do compared to Feign Death and Death Peace?  A third FD? 
  If so I can't imagine needing that, the only reason I need Death Peace 
is because of the refresh timer on FD, and by the time I've cast DP and 
failed with it, the FD one is refreshed.

Is it somehow better, say faster casting or cheaper casting, so that I'd 
replace FD or DP with it?

Again, not on Combine server, it will be a while before thats an option. 
  We currently have original, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin expansions, 
which means we're limited to level 60 and have only just recently gotten 
the first set of AA (for a while we were at 60 and nothing at all to 
spend exp on, that was fantastic, talk about taking the pressure off!)

I can certainly imagine a 9th spell gem would help, I'm constantly 
swapping things in and out, or not being able to cast things I'd like 
because mid fight I can't sit down long enough to swap.
