I collected enough shark meat when it was for sale in Thurgadin to get my
enchanter to 16. Viscous mana vials, enchant silver and enchant electrum,
plus a little breeze to make it easier are what she was born for. Sadly, I
don't think there's enough shark meat in Norrath to get her to 49 to make
her really useful for cultural smithing... But being able to do this much
myself makes it a lot cheaper.
