Not "irrelevant". It's pertinent, because there indeed is ambiguity
of a sorts in the use of the word "pussy" as a vulgarity, when used
as an epithet.

I don't personally regard this any different than calling another
player a "sissy".

Be that as it may, the O.P. new about the language filter, and elected
to deliberately flout it. This deliberately flouting shows that he 1)
knew the rules, 2) willfully decided to not follow them, and 3) used a
circumvention technique.

All the signs of someone who should know how to be a grown up and
take their medicine, IMO.
