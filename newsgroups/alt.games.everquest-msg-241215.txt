I used to clip through the wall in field of bone all the time; would fall
down and watch 'red' monsters raining down as well, with no guards to save
me; finally figured out the way through the ocean.

Got stuck in Splitpaw once; trapped in a wall unable to move and being
attacked by monsters without even being able to hit back; fortunately a
guide pulled me out in time.

Now what would be really nice if they could stop beasties warping through
walls to hit you, but i suspect that would be exploited too heavily. Still
as a newbie I was unimpressed when i found creatures could hit you through
the walls of the huts in east commonlands; it was difficult to get into a
defendable position.
