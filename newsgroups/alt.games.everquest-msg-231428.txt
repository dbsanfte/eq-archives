god

\God\ (g[o^]d), n. 
 1. A being conceived of as possessing supernatural power, and to be
propitiated by sacrifice, worship, etc.; a divinity; a deity; an
object of worship; an idol.

2. The Supreme Being; the eternal and infinite Spirit, the Creator,
and the Sovereign of the universe; Jehovah.

3. A person or thing deified and honored as the chief good; an object
of supreme regard.

Whose god is their belly. --Phil. iii. 19.

4. Figuratively applied to one who wields great or despotic power.
[R.] --Shak.

Or an even better definition in my opinion is this: 

A being of supernatural powers or attributes, believed in and
worshiped by a people, especially a male deity thought to control some
part of nature or reality. 

Omnipotence only factors in to the standard interpretation of what
"god" means. When in reality, divinity is entirely relative to the
subject. 

To a neanderthal, a medieval knight could be considered a god. 

However, according to the lore I've seen regarding PoP, mortals
entered the realms of power, where the gods themselves were
vulnerable, and the avatars they sent forth were only physical
manifestations of their essence. Hence the killing and rebirth, so to
speak...
