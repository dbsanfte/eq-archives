   Thank you.  And you're very close on the spelling of the groom;
"Lennaman", but goes by "Lenny".
    The ceremony was very nice, though there was some annoyance
from /ooc and Frankel the Pirate (No...I don't want to brave the
"Icy lands of Opportunity"!  I'm getting married here!).  A few
people cried, and no one (openly) objected to my marrying a troll. 
   After the ceremony, most everyone got very, very drunk.  Some 
cough*daFoo*cough got a head start while waiting for the guide
to show up.
   All in all, it turned out pretty well, IMHO.

Annie  <--- Especially liked killing Dorn with the groom as
            the honeymoon entertainment.
