Erm...yes, I think...not sure I understand what you mean but using Dual
Wield will increase the DW skill and every time each hand actually attacks
it will have the chance to raise the skill of whatever it is using, h2h or
1hb.

Whatever weapon is being skill is being used it can raise the appropriate
skill, if you have 1hb in off hand then every successful DW test (ie it
actually swings) has a chance to raise that skill. If you have H2H as
primary and 1hb as secondary then you will sell less 1hb raises as it will
attack less.

Attack rating only goes by whats in the Primary hand, it ignores the off
hand completely.
EG If you had 10 in H2H and 100 in 1hb but put the 1hb in your offhand your
attack rating will be calculated on H2H as that is what your primary attack
will be.

No, there is no relation at all. Your off hand makes a Dual Wield test by
the delay of the weapon it's holding, the test isn't always going to be a
success so it will always attack less, this also means that the quicker the
weapon in your off hand the faster you'll get skill raises for Dual Wield so
if your DW skill is lagging behind stick your faster weapon in there every n
ow and then, to help it along.
