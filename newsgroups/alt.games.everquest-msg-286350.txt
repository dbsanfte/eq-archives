This is correct.  From what I gather, EQ originally launched in March
a little over 8 years ago.  In recent years, they have had a special
event run every year for a month, starting in mid-March.  During this
time, selected old named mobs are beefed up as Fabled versions.  For
example, instead of Drelzna (who used to drop JBoots) spawning in
Najena, the Fabled Drelzna spawns instead, to drop Fabled JBoots.
Fabled mobs are usually far tougher than the non-Fabled versions, and
the drops are correspondingly better too.  Fabled exist over a wide
range of levels, from Fabled Fippy Darkpaw to what were once end-game
raid mobs (and with the Fabled beefing up, are again).  The first time
this was done, the developers restricted themselves to the "old
world" (before Kunark).  Each year, they have brought back the old
Fabled mobs and added one more expansion's worth (in order of
release).  This past March, Fabled Luclin mobs were introduced (e.g.
Fabled Yelloweyes in Paludal Caverns).

In short, don't expect to see the Fabled mobs spawn again until next
March.
