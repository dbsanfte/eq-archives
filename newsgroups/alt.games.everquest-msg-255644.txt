While I'm not in the same state as James getting into KT isn't a stroll 
through the rose garden.  1st mob he won't be able to tank on the way there
will be the Boss of sewer 1.  It sucks.   After that the other sewer trials
are mindbogglingly wimpy to the degree that a ranger can MT them.  Then
the mountain trials.  Plate melee don't tank there either really, we are
just speedbumps for the charmed hasted pooka.  Hell, I had more fun playing
around in Air with the retarted mana sucking splitters than I've had in
the mountain trials.
