Logged into EQ last night, in the Bazaar, in the bank.  I'm there less than
30 seconds when someone initiates a Trade with me.  Turns out he wants to
give me 100K Plat.  I wait a few seconds to see if he's going to cancel it,
then I click Accept, he clicks Accept, and voila, I'm 5 times richer than
I've ever been.

I thank the guy who gave me the cash, and he logs.  I figure it's someone
who's dropping out and getting rid of his stuff along the way.  Immediately
I start thinking of a few things I want to buy...

And I get a /tell from someone else, similar name to mine:  "Did someone
just give you something?".

I respond "Yes, by an amazing coincidence.  Can you identify the item?".

I get back "100000 Plat.".

My response:  "Drat.".

Turns out the guy paid R/L cash for the Plat, and I accidentally intercepted
the drop.  And the dropper evidently pays no attention to what he's doing.
Checking back, the intended recipient had done a /wave to the dropper,
whereupon the dropper turned to *me* and gave me the cash.

Anyway, spotted the guy, he's in the bank, Dwarven beater of some sort (I'm
human Mage, L 16, started May 1999).  So, I give him the cash, he gives me
1000 Plat for being honest.
