VERANT:  This is the game we are offering, and this is how we intend
to conduct ourselves. In some cases we will exercise tyrannic control
doing as we see fit. After all, it is our game.

YOU:  Seems a bit two-faced and unfair, doesn't it?

VERANT:  Yes, you are probably correct. Would you like to play for a
mere $9.95/month?

YOU:  Sure.

You get the idea. Don't sweat the petty.
