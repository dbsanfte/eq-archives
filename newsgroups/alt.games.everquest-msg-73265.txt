    Many of the Alt. XP skills aren't that hot, or are plain wrong for the
class that gets them (you mean I can Crit Heal? Now if only I cast heals
other than Cel Elixir and Complete Healing....) And skills that would be
desirable are missing - I would, and I'm not exaggerating, get every
Archetype skill to max level if it were a prerequisite to a class skill
setting standing mana regen rate equal to med rate.
