Lance, I generally respect you, so take this for what it's worth.

Let the "idiot" thing drop.  Bush has shown himself to be a helluva lot
smarter than the press played him to be.  He may not be a certified genius,
but he is clearly above average in intellect.  That illusion has been
shattered, if you hold onto it, you only discredit yourself.  If you want to
complain about his policies or his initiatives, feel free, but please drop
this one, it won't fly anymore.
