Yeah, well lots of people called for EQ to die whenAO was released. If it
wasn't so buggy/twisted/young AO would have put a serious dent into EQ.

All MMORPG need a shakedown time of several months once they go live. They
shouldn't need it, but they do. There are issues that always come up that no
Beta could have predicted. And other problems that got neglected that turn
around and bit the programming team on the bum when 400000 players start
pushing a new game to the limit.

Hell, I bet even SoL goes through these kind of growing pains this December.
