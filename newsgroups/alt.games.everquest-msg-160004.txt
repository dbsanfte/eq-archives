As a druid, I started quadding wooly rhinos at 38. Yes, they do have a lot
of hp. The advantage is that most are yellow/red con at that level and give
a lot of experience. It's more efficient to take on four at a time than one.

I am well equipped for quadding. This might explain why I can quad rhinos
before 40. My mana pool is over 2000; I have a chipped bone bracer with
affiction efficiency II (25% reduction in mana cost); I have a black alloy
medallion (10% mana cost reduction, but I'm not sure if it stacks with the
bracer); I have 189 in evocation specialisation; lastly, I have a moonstone
ring with extended range II (one of the best bargains in the game) so that I
can cast early and safely. Oh, and kei of course!
