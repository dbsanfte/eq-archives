I'm sorry, but I understand each of the words you're using, but when you 
put them together that way, I seem to have some kind of block and am 
unable to make sense of it.

Have ... a... taste ... for... Spam... I can say them, I just don't... 
well, *feel* them in that sentient "I grok" fashion.

And now not kidding: My dad once ate 5 cans of Spam that were in the 
pantry when we moved from one house to another. Of Spam that the 
previous owners did not feel compelled to take with them.

While there has been no evidence that any animal has ever developed the 
defense mechanism of appearing to be abandoned Spam, I can only imagine 
that it should be as big a "Don't Eat Me" symbol as spikey things or 
skunk-spray.

My name's sandtiger, and I'm the child of a parent who ate abandoned Spam.
