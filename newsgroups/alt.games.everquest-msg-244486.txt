Spawn was up yesterday morning.  Managed to get 2 guildies keyed. 
Then in the afternoon I tracked him under the world.  Petitioned him
and the guide that responded told me he would be happy to kill the
forager off, but that it would likely spawn underworld because he has
been doing that since the last patch.  Seeing as how I was able to
track him even under the world (and from some horizontal distance), I
am guessing that the days he was not trackable that his spawn was
disabled.  Probably had too many underworld complaints so they fixed
it by turning him off.  Anyway, the happy end to the story is we
killed Trak and I got my epic.  Yaaay me!
