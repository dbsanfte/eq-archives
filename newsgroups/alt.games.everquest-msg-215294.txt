I always consider it payment for carpal tunnel syndrome :)

If it bothers you, become an MLer and keep *empty* bags at the top of your 
inventory. When you are done, go through and ask if anyone wants the stuff, 
or go sell it and split the result.

/autosplit is nontrivially broken, though; if a mob drops 5p 5g 5s 6c, 
everyone but the looter gets 1 cp, and the looter gets 5p 5g 5s 1c.
