Others seem to be having a similar problem, but I'm not sure if it's the 
same. While I see the nice, heavy gold type cursor while sitting through 
the login and splash screens, when I get in-game, it changes to a normal, 
white Windows cursor. I could live with that, except that when I begin to 
move (WASD controlled), it disappears (or changs to the text insertion 
cursor "|", anyway), and I have to shake it to get it back. I can manage to 
make it work, but it is very inconvenient and costs me a couple seconds 
sometimes when trying to target something or operate the UI.

I'm using a bit of a hodge podge of custom UI elements, but none that 
should be replacing the cursor. I haven't tried reverting to the default UI 
yet. Maybe that would give me a clue. I'm at work now, so I'll try that 
later.

Anyone else run into this?
