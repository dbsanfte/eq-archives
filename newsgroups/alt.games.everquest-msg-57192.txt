I've heard that with XP I can finally run EQ as a windows program,
which is to say I can switch out to my email or whatever and
switch back in at will... but I can't seem to make it work.

You say "Windows key disabled in registry..." is that some
arcane manuever that makes this possible?

My solo, 80% of the time medding, druid butt would sure
love this, and my RL friends would like to see me stop
neglecting their EMails so much!

With straight out of the box home XP that came installed
on my new machine, nothing seemed to happen when I
did the three fingered salute... until I zoned, then I could
see a ghost image of the task manager, and in normal
f10 mode (not heads up or no text) with the window smaller than
the screen, I could see the manager behind my window, but
mouse would not go out into it, nor would any key combination
I could think of let me affect it.
