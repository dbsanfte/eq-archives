Well just a guess based on what they have said about boats....

Waffles will not be possible at first, but if your village chooses to
allocate resources eventually it should be able to build a mill, a
hearth, and a smithing forge.  If villagers reach high enough skill that
one can run the mill, one can create a waffle iron at the forge and
another can create the batter and cook it on the hearth a waffle may be
created.  Once your village has created a waffle someone can then train
up from a master to eventually be able to eat the waffle.

game being so silly" h
