1. I can see when just browsing, the price is a nice thing to have. But
sometimes I know what I want and I just scroll through till I find the
icon I want. But these icons are small and my old aging eyes have a
harder time picking the right item. So for those cases, I like the
older style vendor display
2. The buy and no done - I did a buy when I meant to close. Fortunately
it was just a rusty sword. phew
3. Sorting by name is a very nice feature. Having the items scramble
after a purchase reduces the effectiveness

I think most seasoned players have an idea of what stuff costs, so i
see that adding the prices is making it easier for new players.
