Is it just me or has anyone else noticed how for some time now since the
anouncment of this new frogman expantion everyday is a challenge to stay
connected without a re-boot and or losing loot.

Seems to me for a company this big and popularity of a game they should be
planning their patches better and not at the time and expence of the
players.

Not to mention but I will because I've yet to get satisfaction, they did a
re-boot the other day just before I was about to make a purchace, I had just
made a withdrawl from the bank whilst checking the bazaar search program and
we were all kicked, after re-logging found myself about 5 - 10 mins back in
time where I was just zoning into the bazaar but when I went to look for my
coins to make my purchase again found them gone, all 32k of them and not in
the bank either.

SO I petition and get no responce, I waited a while, I even hailed a GM as
his name was in Green and told him what happened, he just told me to
petition, so I did but couldn't stay logged long because they booted us
again, now it's too late as I've been told if you ever log before a
correction can be made they will not make an adjustment and the message they
offer at login tells me were sorry if you've lost loot and such but too bad,
EH?

Do they relize how long it takes to make 32k for most players, do they even
care, I don't think so.

As well several times now while in the bazaar everyone has been pulled to a
single spot which has created major lag, so much so that it is difficult to
even move the mouse pointer an inch without it flying around the screen and
no my computer is not a dog, in fact probably better than most, P4 2GHz GF4
etc., but this is crazy stuff happening and also the double mouse pointer
issue has been going on for a couple days now as well, it's not just me
either as most everyone has mentioned it.

I really hope Sony EQ1 get's their act together because until I hear EQ2 is
running perfectly, I won't be spending another cent.

So now that's off my chest, anyone for a good old fashioned game of
checkers?

Cya
