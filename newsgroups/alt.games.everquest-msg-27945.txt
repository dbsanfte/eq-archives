Hold LEFT SHIFT (I think) while booting to disable most of the stuff
starting up at boot time to see if that helps.
Use msconfig to disable the stuff that is starting up automatically, if the
above helped. (Scanner software, ICQ, Gator, webshots, etc, etc,)
Once you track down the locaton of these programs, it's easy to create a
folder on the Programs menu that lets you start up stuff as needed.
(ie: If you have a scanner, then why have the driver load up every single
time you boot your PC, as you probably only use the scanner on occasion)

Did Personal Web server install be default? If so, you might consider
getting rid of it.
If you've got anti-virus software installed, then you might consider
disabling the Live/System scan while playing EQ.
Disable the Scheduler so that it won't start up any process' while playing.

If MS Office is installed, then go to control panel and disable FAST FIND.
It'll go out and Index .doc and .xls, etc files.
If MS Office is installed, get rid of the OFFICE STARTUP in the Startup
folder. No reason to pre-load any code for the MS Office apps.
Is the silly office toolbar loading up? Get rid of it...

Find a free system resources monitor and see just what your free resources
are after a fresh reboot. (mine is 96-98 typically)
Check out langa.com and read up on system resources if you have no idea what
they are all about. There's some good info there on making your PC more
stable as well. http://www.langa.com/newsletters/2000/2000-05-22.htm#1 is
the starting point for the Resource info.
There are follow-up articles to this one, that provide more info, and offer
helpful suggestions.

Download CACHMAN and use it to tweak your cache settings.

Not a huge improvement, but every little bit helps.

You might look into creating a fix-sized swap file, rather than letting
Windows use the dynamicly-sized file as it does by default.
If you've got Norton's Speed disk, once you have a Fixed swap, you can use
SD to place it on the fastest part of the HD.
Again, not a huge improvement, but it can all add up.

As cheep as RAM is right now, it couldn't huet a bit to add another 128Meg.
Downside to that is that the P4 requires Dimms in pairs, so you can't just
order a single 128 stick of PC133 for $30.

I'm running an Celeron 600 (O/C'd to 730) w/256 Meg Ram, Radion LE, and an
MX300 sound card, and EQ runs well.
The only slow-downs I see, are when there are LOTS of spell efffects going
off, and I'm not positive that about how much slow down as the Radeon is a
recent upgrade, (from a 16 Meg fury pro) and i've not been in a group with a
lot of casting going on yet.....

Hope that there is something helpful here..
