That's a good example of NBG working. I should probably reiterate that I 
only support a non-NBG approach in pickup groups where you're all 
primarily strangers. I'm not overly suspicious of people trying to rip me 
off or anything. There's just no bond there that really justifies one 
person not getting a shot at the loot, IMO.

As I said, enough pickup groups with the same person and you may well 
have no trouble at all deferring to them on many items.

NBG among friends is a wonderful thing. There's just no reason in my mind 
to expect everyone to let me have all the loot that only I can use, when 
they could get great benefit from it as well, even if only by selling it.
