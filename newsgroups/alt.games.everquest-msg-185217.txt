What's Ally?  Allakhazam?  You know they're not free either, right? :)

I use both sites extensively for this and that...but I'd never use
Allakhazam for spell info...it takes too long to get anywhere (and I
subscribe!).  It's hard to beat castersrealm when it comes to quick spell
info for every class.
