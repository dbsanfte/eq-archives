Very sad to hear you're serverless again :(

Drinal is a lot healthier now since the server merge - a lot more people 
floating around.  Being a family guild guild leader I don't really know how 
the top end raiding guilds are doing as I don't have much to do with them, 
however we're all having a hoot of a time with the new DoN expansion.

I also mourn the loss of the EQcleric site.  It went down about a month ago 
now and haven't found it resurrected anywhere yet either.  Here's hoping 
I'll find a similar one soon as I learnt a lot from there.
