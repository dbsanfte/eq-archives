Its actually quite common. I have had this in a number of zones (Misty 
Thicket, Butcher Block) and its caused by a corruption in the files for the 
zone. Nothing serious though just delete the zone files and then redownload 
them. EQ will detect they are missing and automatically download them for 
you.

WHat i want to know is why are the models always human?
