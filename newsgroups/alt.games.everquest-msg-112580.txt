This might take too much coding to do, but what I'd like to see on these
servers is that you can have more than one character, but you can't switch
rapidly between characters.  For example, when you switch from character A
to B, the date/time should be noted by the server, and you would not be able
to play any character other than B for the next week real time.  After a
week, you could switch back to A, or to character C, but you are then stuck
with that character for a week.
