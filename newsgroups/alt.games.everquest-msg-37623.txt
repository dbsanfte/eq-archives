Do you have a Live! soundcard? these cards seem to cause a lot of problems
with EQ and the files it has trouble with are the EQ soulds files (.s3d)

Seems to have trouble with a texture map for Sky. Try deleting the two files
.s3d it is having trouble with and repatching. Also try thorough file check.

If still no joy, reinstall you sounds drivers (make sure latest ones) and
then reinstall GFX drivers followed by reinstalling DX7.0a or 8.0a after
