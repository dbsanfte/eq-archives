Actually, the reason that these constructs are created is because they
*do* offer a degree of protection to escort services. With out-and-out
prostitution, a single instance of "sucky, fucky, five bucky" can
bring a conviction. With escort services where sex is putatively not
guaranteed as part of the package, one must prove a preponderance of
instances where sex was the ultimate result of a financial
transaction.

Very few people are ever convicted of running an escort service.
Instead, people are arrested on a limited array of other charges
(usually tax and OSHA) and then promised that they will receive
maximum hassle and maximum punishment from the courts if they don't
cop to a package offered by the DA.
