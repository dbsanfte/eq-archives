*holds head in pain*

Please read what I wrote.  I wrote that AMERICANS are 
going on the radio and CLAIMING to do it in the interest 
of the world.  I've never once stated they SHOULD do it 
on behalf of the world.  What I HAVE tried to point out 
is that it's not right to say what you don't mean.  It 
makes you sound bad.  See what I mean now?  I was hoping 
to make a point about how some people should probably 
not be allowed to speak in public *smile* but you took 
it WAY the wrong way, believe me.

Said it before, will say it again.  I don't know where 
you guys are getting this "Ha ha look at the Americans 
suffer" attitude from, but you couldn't be farther from 
the truth.  It was DAMN hard to work today.  I just 
about flipped out at four people because they were 
sitting there questioning why the pilots or the 
passengers of the planes didn't do anything.  In 
retrospect, I wish I'd said something.  They don't 
deserve what people have been saying about them, nor do 
the families and friends they left behind deserve to 
*know* that that's what people are saying about them.

I don't necessarily agree with you that people shouldn't 
get involved across borders.  I *don't* agree with 
stepping in and dictating how a country should be run, 
but I know that in certain cases it must be done.  IE, 
Germany - because what they were doing started to cross 
borders and endanger the entire world.  OTOH, I think 
that when a disaster occurs, one should forget one's 
borders and do what one can - thus, I will be giving 
blood as soon as possible.  In fact it's made me feel 
fairly guilty that I've let so much time lapse since I 
*last* gave blood.

I'm upset right now, I don't need a bomb to land in 
Canada to make me so.  Everybody is a human being.  
Everybody deserves to have a life.  When they start 
destroying the lives of those around them, someone must 
step in and stop it, and I don't think there *is* any 
100% right way to do it, but it must be done.  But again 
- everybody's life, imho, is equally important.  I don't 
care where they live, or who they are - they are the 
same as me, and when I see something bad happening, my 
imagination goes wild imagining how *I* would feel in 
their places.
