Hmmm.... Im a cleric, and my wife is a wizard.  We both have differnet
stances on the direct tells and ooc....
She usualy willnot respond to any shout or ooc for request to xloc or
port, but will go out of her way to help someone who sent a direct
tell.... (this just makes me go WTF??!?!? but I love her anyway)
Me... I personaly abhor direct tells.... that is not to say Ill ignore
the direct tell... (it really depends on how they word the request...
Manners and style go a long way with me)...
like the...   "are you busy?" tell... 
my response is always  "depends"
for me, if I am looking for a SoW, port, Xloc, etc.   I almost always
start in Say... (of course not if no one is around me).  Then Ill move
to OOC.... then if the need is bad enough Ill take it to Shout... (no
I dont ooc or shout for a SoW)
oh and when i ask for something in say... I dont do the  "sow plz"
I usualy attempt to have a complete sentance (of course my american
public school program did not quite get the skills through me)
something to the effect.  
"Is there anyone in the area able to bestow SoW upon this cleric.  I
have a rather long run ahead."

YMMV

Different strokes for different folks...
