*** Collection Quests ***

- There is now a Collections tab in the quest journal listing all of your collection quests.
- Collection quests no longer count toward your maximum quest total of 50 in the quest journal.
- In order to add an item to your collection, you will now examine the item, then drag and drop it into your journal.
