Are you under the impression that Al Qaeda is the *only*
terrorist organization or supporter of terrorism in the
world?

I don't think there's a direct connection between Iraq and
Al Qaeda per se, but I have no doubt that Saddam has long
been a supporter and enabler of various other groups and
attempts at destabilization -- and would ramp up his efforts
by orders of magnitude if he acquired nuclear weapons and
believed they made him "untouchable".

And after 9/11, we're not in a mood to make fine distinctions
about who belongs to or supports which exact group.

When a city endures the last straw because of an action
by organized crime family X, does it make sense to crack
down *only* on X -- or to wage all out war on *all* organized
crime in the city?

The "Axis of Evil" phrase has already been rendered trite,
but it gives a name to the philosophy of targeting not *just*
the one specific organization which engineered 9/11, but
*all* those who are likely agents of similar future strikes.
