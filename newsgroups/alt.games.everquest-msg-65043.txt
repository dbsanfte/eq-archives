    Druids can port now, and a high level druid can pretty much sweep most
lower-level dungeons. If it isn't a problem now, it won't be much worse
after a change of this nature.

    I've always favoured the "anyone can be bound anywhere that isn't a
dungeon zone, with a confirmation box for Bind Affinity" approach. Protects
the phat lewt from being Gate-farmed, and the top mobs from being bind-point
rushed (with minor exceptions like Kael).

    For guild taxi days, sure. But being able to port is a powerful ability,
and in the case of wizards is considered a class-defining ability. You're
pissed because bards and druids can Track, and you don't think a wizard will
be perturbed when a big chunk of his spells are farmed out to some NPC?

    Um, these druids aren't calling out 50 pp ports. They are answering the
"I'm paying 100 pp to go to EJ, plz!" calls from the Thurg bank. I agree
with the "Porting for X" price you quoted - ours is similar. But the
well-to-do druids don't auction their service - they wait for the
overpayers.

    If the benefit isn't for them, they won't care.
