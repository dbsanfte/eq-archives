Here is exactly the point.  You are not willing to sit in nexus and
provide free ports all day.  Your time is valuable and it is boring to
sit in nexus.  Time is even more valuable to a high level chanter
since he could be out hunting and bringing in good plat.  If people
want the service of him sitting there in nexus and providing kei, then
people need to donate enough that will make it seem worth it to him. 
Otherwise why should he stick around?
