No they are not maxed by lvl at all, in fact i've made a lvl 5
grandmasterjeweler chanter. (couldn't even enchant clay/silver but does have
trophee already +50 cha is excellent for chanters) so to answer your
question yes it's definately possible.
Be aware though that till you can spend aa on new tanaan crafting mastery,
ONLY ONE skill can break 200 so be carefull if you are persuing several
skills at once. (If you are a caster, you might be familiar with
specialisation where only 1 can break 50).
