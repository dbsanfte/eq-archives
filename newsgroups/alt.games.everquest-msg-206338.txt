I like grouping with a specific list of friends, but if they are not on, I solo.
I loathe playing pickup groups with strangers, it just is not something I enjoy.
I'm not completely antisocial, I do chat with folks and offer buffs/heals to
people who need them.   I just prefer to play solo sometimes.  (After a hard day
at work, it's kind of relaxing to put on some nice music and do a little
mindless mob-whacking, too...)

So, your post intrigued me.  My Beastlord just dinged 55 and everyplace I know
of to solo is now light blue or green.  Where in the PoP is it possible to solo
at my level?  I don't need lightning fast XP (though that's always nice), I just
need someplace I can play for some gain when my friends are not available.

Advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!   MJ
