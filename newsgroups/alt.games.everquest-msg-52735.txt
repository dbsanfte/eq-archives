As far as I'm concerned, anything posted to this news group
"involves in the lest" and "addresses" anyone who reads this
news group.  Whether they participate in the thread or not is
of no matter.  If you want to have discussions or make
statements that do not involve all of us, then you should take
it to e-mail.
