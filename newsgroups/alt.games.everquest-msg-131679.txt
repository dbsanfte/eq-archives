No, it is not.  Not even close.   My friend that I group with a great deal has
Nature's Recovery.   It heals slightly more than regrowth per tick, and lasts
about 1/3 as long.  It does stack with regrowth, but as a warrior with 6k hit
points, it's an insignificant amount of healing per tick, and it seems pretty
useless to me.
