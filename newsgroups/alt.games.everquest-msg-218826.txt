All other considerations aside, those two spells are a big reason why a 52
cleric is a lot more effective than a 52 tank when fighting 60+ monsters.

See, here's the thing: heals don't get resisted.  I don't have to overcome a
pally's magic resistance in order to land a Complete Heal.

When Monual was leveling up, I went to places that were nominally way too
high for me.  Heck, when I was 45 I went into Velk's Lab (back in the day
when that was *the* place to level in), /ooc'd for a group - and got one.
Try that trick with a 45 tank.  While that was an extreme level, it was by
far a common occurrence for me to be in a group where everyone was five or
more levels higher than I was.  I loved it, because when I grouped with
people my level, the XP was a lot slower.

Their are downsides, of course.  A 52 cleric is going to have a much smaller
mana pool and will regen mana less quickly.  A 52 cleric is also going to
have trouble doing things like root-park adds or stand patiently taking hits
from an add until the chanter can mez it.  A group with a 52 cleric may have
to scale back the scope of its pulls - make safer pulls, don't pull as
often - to accommodate the 52 cleric.

But the point is, a 52 cleric *can* be a useful contributor to a group of
60+ folks.  There really is no way a 52 warrior could be anything other than
a healers' mana sink in that same group.

Perhaps "100% effective" is the wrong term.  Still, a 52 cleric can be a
useful contributor, while a 52 plate tank would be near-useless.
