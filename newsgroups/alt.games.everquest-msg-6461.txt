Now let me clarify something here...

First off, I feel that this newsgroup and many of the EQ websites are
great resources for determining what various items are for and what
they do.

Secondly, I've used these resources many times myself and I've got
nothing against asking for help.

However, when someone starts _complaining_ about the fact that the
game doesn't spoon feed them everything and they actually have to
*gasp* find out for themselves... I'm sorry, but that just goes a
little far. 

Now if that means I'm 'stuck up' then, hey,  I'll plead guilty.

Any others here?
