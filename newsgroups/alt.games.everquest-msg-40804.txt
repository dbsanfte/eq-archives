    I'd split the difference here.  I, too, have seen a monk duel-wielding
jade maces do amazing taunts, but I have also seen epic monk vs. epic ranger
and epic warrior.  Ranger/Warrior still had higher taunt even with the
outdamaging the monk verifyably did.  The reason?  Procs and raw taunt
skill.  So agree with Jesse, here, and lower monk taunt to, say, 8 or 7.

My opinion (such that it is),

-Grim
