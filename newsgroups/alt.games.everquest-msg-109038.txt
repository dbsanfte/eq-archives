The one thing I do agree on is that it would be allot more interesting if
orcs did on random occasion start attacking cities (in mass numbers), or
gnolls be seen outside of Blackburrow attacking Qeynos (kind of like fippy
darkpaw does in the Qeynos newbie area?).
Things like this that don't require an actual GM event, kind of like what
I've read about the quest where you wake the sleeper and it causes massive
worldwide events to unfold, or the quest in Velius where you have to destroy
all of the giants before they reach the village (I've only read about these,
not actually seen them, so not 100% sure how accurate my descriptions/memory
is on them).

I think that would just add an interesting set of events to the game.  Maybe
if it happened often too, every few days or so (per sever too).  Like the
server picks a random number between 30 and 50, and that's how long before
an event happens.  Something similar to that.  Then after its over, repeat
random number selection and wait for next time for event.
