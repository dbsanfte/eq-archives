I had REAL bad experience with this card. Not messed up graphics, but sub
10fps performance in all zones.

Even my Geforce 2 MX 200 (yes, a 200!) seemed to run circles around the
Radeon 8500 in EverQuest.

Now, I've read a *LOT* of messages on the EverQuest web forum about people
with a Radeon 8500 and horrible framerates - but I've also read people who
have a Radeon 8500 and the game plays GREAT!!!

So whats the story? Is there some combination of drivers needed for good
performance? Certain video card/motherboard combinations that don't work,
etc, etc?

I would like to hear from people who have had a Radeon 8500 in their system,
and what kind of performance they had, and if works well for them - if they
have had any knowled of the game just not working right before (ie: REALLY
bad framerate).

My setup:
Celeron 1GHz
VIA motherboard (with latest 4in1s), model "DFI CA64-TC"
768 Megs RAM
Windows XP Pro
GeForce2 MX 200

With the Radeon 8500, I tried the "6058" beta drivers, and "6043" official
drivers from ATI. The Radeon 8500 I had was a 275/275 retail model built by
ATI.
