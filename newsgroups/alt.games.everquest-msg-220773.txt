	Sinclair was a war hero of sorts...he shot down more Minbari fighters than
any other human pilot, and his attempted suicide run was packaged as a "heroic
charge" by the media.  Within the military, he had hit the Glass Ceiling, of
course.

	He certainly wasn't a war hero in the sense that Sheridan was.
