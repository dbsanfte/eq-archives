    Yeah, when I think about it, I am. Take one look at monks. I don't want
to be there, not after hundreds of hours building up my character and
overcoming *our* limitations. Not that I want shammies nerfed either. I
don't want anybody nerfed. If warriors need fixing, fix 'em.

    That's a wild exageration and you know it.

    Smacked back down? As in us uppity knights infringing on *your*
territory? And what use is your sympathy? What are you gonna do, /dis
defensive Sony for me? Mash your taunt key? Man you should know, once we
have agro, it's game over.

    You know what the simplest solution for the warrior problem is?

    Delete the class. Even simpler, in technical terms, than nerfing
knights.

Cheers,
James

PS and no I'm *not* serious, for those who post here and can't tell the
difference between a patently inane statement and an inane person.

PPS take a goddamn chill pill already. Do you want a petition for SOE? I'll
sign. I'm just sick of bloody reading about poor innocent warriors, and I'm
*hugely* sick of class nerfs on fucking *melee* classes while the casters
surge further ahead with each expansion.

PPPS *not* that I want casters nerfed either. WTF do I care if mage pets
nearly out-damage monks? It's all experience for me, that's what grouping is
for.
