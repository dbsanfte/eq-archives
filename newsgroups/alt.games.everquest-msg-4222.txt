Nope, you are forcing it now, it just doesn't flow.  You need to let go
of the effort and let it come from within naturally.  From a place of
peace within yourself you can project as you did in your earlier efforts
filled with divine wisdom.  Ahh, one can only hope that was not a
momentary spark of brilliance to be seen no more.  Surely a.g.e will
enter into a new age of enlightenment if only you can do better without
trying harder.

Still, I appreciate your effort, much better than the childishness of
your one line posts.
