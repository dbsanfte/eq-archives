No, not really.   Generally it's about 2 minutes from "Bids on X now!" to
"Congrats Y!".   If the item dropped from a mini on the way to the boss,
we're just pulling zone trash, so no reason to stop pulls to deal with it.
And if the item dropped from a boss, then we almost certainly need a mana
break anyways.

90 percent of the attunable items seem to be on one group mobs so far.
Raid mob drops are still No drop.
