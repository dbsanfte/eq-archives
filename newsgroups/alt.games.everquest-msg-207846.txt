Healing is not as huge an issue with a Paladin, and, yes, I was talking 
about the higher level heals for the druid.  Paladin can deal with 
rezzing if need be, 90% at high level.  Personally, I think a shaman is 
best, due to the slows, heals, buffs.  The big thing missing is mana 
regen, whish is easily remedied with a KEI once you are of appropriate 
level.
