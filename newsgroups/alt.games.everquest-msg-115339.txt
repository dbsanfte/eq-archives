The first time I did the waki quest took me 3 weeks to get the damn second
claw, killing every f'ing panda cub I could track.  Had everything else,
just needed one more claw.  Went back there a few days ago, got everything I
needed in about 3 hours including travel time back to Oasis to get the
poison sacs.  Then dumb me, I gave away my new waki to a newbie, I'm too
softhearted.
