	After many years, my EQ account lapsed a few weeks ago, and I am not renewing 
it.  I have no invectives to hurl...it's simply time to move on.  If I were 
going to curse anything about EQ it would have been the idiotic design choices 
in Planes of Power that destroyed entire guilds, mine among them, but they've 
long since been corrected.  There were plenty of good times for me in EQ, and 
I'm glad I played, but the je ne sais quois is gone for me now and I don't 
think it will be back any time soon.

	I've been lurking here a while and it's become clear to me that without being 
involved in the game the newsgroup has also lost its charms.  There were 
plenty of good times here, too, but again it's time to travel onward.  I might 
surface over at the CoH ezboard, or alt.games.coh if GigaNews/Comcast ever 
picks it up.

	I'll single out Annie and Lenny for goodbyes; I'd do the same for Adar, Sam 
Schlansky and James Grahme if they still posted here. :-)

	Good journey.
