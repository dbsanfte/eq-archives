Okay, I'll bite.

Where, in Everquest, do Shamans or Druids (or Clerics, for that
matter) do anything at all that can be described as being
a "religious leader"?

What, in your mind, makes this a "FACT" in the EQ world
so uncontestable that you go ballistic on anyone who finds
that "fact" less than the most relevant thing in this discussion?

Sure, quest text in EQ often revolves around pleasing/displeasing
a particular deity, if that's what you're keying off of, but that's
true of just about *all* classes in the game that can (or must)
adhere to one of the plethora of in-game deities.  There are a 
shitload of Paladin-NPC quests as well which involve serving 
Tunare, Rodcet Nife, etc.  Hell, there are even Warrior quests
which require you to serve Innoruuk and so on.
