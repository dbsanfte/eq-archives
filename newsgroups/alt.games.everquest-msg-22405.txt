There seems to be a great shortage of Muffins in Neriak. 
After innocently shooting the breeze with the local NPC's no less than 3 of
them have pushed a huge muffin crate into my hands and asked me to fill it with
instructions to bake the damn things myself and not just go and buy them. Im
just curious as to the apparent Muffin love of Norraths dark brothers and
sisters, or has this muffin madness spread to other cities across the lands?
Im in 2 minds whether or not to deliver the spongey goods on this one, because
a.) I cant bake for shit.
and b.) i cant peruse the assorted cookbooks without buying them to see if the
muffin recipe is within. I now have a bank full of cookbooks ill probably never
use and still dont know the recipe. well i do because i looked it up on a web
site but it states that i also need a muffin tray which i cant seem to find
anywhere and well..in the grand scheme of my necromancical life, how important
is sating this no doubt unhealthy lust for muffins within my community? And i
just dont feel comfortable with the idea of a powerful, pet summoning, dark
necro bad ass....who does a little cake baking on the side.
