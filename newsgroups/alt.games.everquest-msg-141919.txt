Well, I do not concentrate on xping.  I do a lot of guild events that often
involve little to no xp, I do a lot of tradeskill stuff, and quests.  As to
comparing it to 53, it was much worse.  55 is a breeze in comparison as
well.  I could not handle killing the same mob over and over again night
after night, I'd go nuts.
