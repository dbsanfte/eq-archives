I have EQ running wonderfully with Linux (transgaming.com winex).  Very
pleased with how that all works.

Now I'm trying to get the Magelo client to run, but having very little
success.  The good news is that the install went just fine (well, no
errors or obvious screwups).  The bad news is I can't get magelo to run.  
2 questions

A)  Has anyone ever tried or succeeded to get magelo to run with winex
under linux?

B)  Could somebody running the winders version look at their short cut and
tell me if it points to MageloEQ.exe or "Magelo Update.exe"?  Are there
any command line arguments listed?

I get no errors, I just get no magelo either.
