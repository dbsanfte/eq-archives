Again, it's part of the human monk's headband quests. Red headband, I believe, but
it's been a while since I did it, so I'm not positive on that count. Since they
fixed the quest (which was broken for part of the summer) the head's aren't *that*
rare anymore, and lots of monks quest for them themselves. Frankly I'd be shocked
if you got 100 plat for it. Probably a lot less if you can find a monk too lazy to
hunt for it themselves.
