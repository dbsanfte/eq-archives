GM and guides always answer 'stuck' petitions pretty fast in my exp.
They can do it fast and get it off their que. This is one of the few things
they can verify fast and have the power to fix immediately.

Most bad experiences happen with CS when the guides/gms can't
or wont do anything. Usually because whatever happened can not
be proven by the player. Trust me I know, I had to go thru all kinds of
red tape to get my faction restored on one of my characters after
they all got reset. The first thing all guides/gms assume is that the
player is lying or trying to scam them, because 9 times out of 10
someone probably is. This is like going to your teacher after the
dog really ate your homework. "No really, the dog ate my
homework, seriously." "Yeah sure kid, You got an F, have a nice day."
