*think*  I suppose it's safe to assume that if someone pulls this sort of
crap that they are greedy, aye?  There might be other motivation (causing
grief because they enjoy it for it's own sake), but usually it is greed
for xp or loot.  And as such, they probably want to be in a guild that can
provide them with loot they can't get in groups or solo.  So...the threat
of the guild is fairly viable.  I can see that.
