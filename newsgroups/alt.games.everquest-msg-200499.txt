I was running into the same problem.  The rain would kick
on and I'd have to turn off my speakers or risk going insane.
Actually, the snow bugs me more than the rain, but they
are part of the same problem.  In Sony's infinite wisdom they
didn't tie the ambient sound to any of your volume sliders.
So, near as I can tell, the ambient sounds (rain, snow, pub
noises, etc) are all running at 100% volume.  Even if you put
your 'sound' at 50%.
I e-mailed sony to ask them about this and their first response
was a joke, and when I called them on it they said it should
be fixed in a patch soon.  Well, 4 weeks later no patch. :-)
My only suggestion is to put 'sound' level to 100 % and
adjust the rest of your system around that.  Its helped,
though not perfect.
