Good point. However, this isn't necessarily about what's ultimately 
"right" or "wrong". It's about what a segment finds acceptible and 
consistent with its own tenets and purpose. 

Granted, most shoot for doing what's right, but this isn't a computer 
program where you can rely on the end result given a basic set of 
parameters. It's a situation involving human nature and more 
specifically, the failings thereof. People have no choice but to make a 
judgement call, and under the circumstances, the odds were well in favor 
of the individual being one who would not be a good addition to a mature 
group of like-minded individuals.

So sure, there is a possibility that the guy wasn't really as he had 
portrayed himself to date. It's just not likely enough for debate.
