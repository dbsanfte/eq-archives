I'm not sure what level you are, but percussion skill (and all the other
musical skills) do improve.

I think it's worth keeping them all up.  Don't worry about it until level
16 when you get dual wield.  It will all catch up then.

Not totally broken, but they lie to you.  Give the package to the bard
in the far right corner (opposite side of the room from Felisity).  The
guy who give you the mail quest in Freeport (going to Kelethin).
