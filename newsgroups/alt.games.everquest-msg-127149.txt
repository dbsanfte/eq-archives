If you don't have a haste item yet, get one. Do not pass go, do not 
collect 200p. Save up for that Wu's Trance Stick. It rocks. Velium Fire 
rings  (6 ac 65 hp) are awesome also. Maybe some spider fur gear would be 
nice.

Might I suggest Crystal Caverns at 35? Theres a bank in zone, and the exp 
is great. The loot is pretty good, too.

If you really want to kill giants, pick up an Adamantite Bo Stick, which 
will ROCK any large-size mob. Read up on it first- it is called the Suicide 
Stick for a reason :)
