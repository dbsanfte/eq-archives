Surely you can't be serious!  As long as there are people, there will be
whining, kvetching, and general carrying-on.

Even with the auto-lotto system you can bet that someone will complain "Why
were you in on it?  You don't need it!".

Once boxes are dropped, you've got about 10 minutes to open them before they
become generally available.  Once they become generally available they can
be opened by anyone *simultaneously*.

Once they're openable, multiple people can open them at the same time, and
the winner's the one who presses "loot all" first, and has room for
whatever's inside.  I have opened an ignored box to see what's inside, then
had someone else come running up, open it and click, and hey, presto!  the
loot's gone.

I've also come upon a discarded box and been told by others waiting for the
timer to run out to "bug off, man".  That was amusing.  Beat him to the
click, too.
