is it possible to download EQ2 if I just get the core patching file (for 
example everquest2.exe) and run it?  I only ask because I am currently 240 
miles from home, in a hotel until friday and I'd really like to start 
playing EQ2.  I can get the CD key off the disk from my wife once I have the 
game downloaded, but I have no way to get the disk where I need it 
today/tomorrow.  Thanks to anyone who can help.
