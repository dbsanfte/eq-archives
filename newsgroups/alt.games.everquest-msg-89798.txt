I understand what he means by "on the take".

Example:  I was in Velks in a group.  Wizard lead.  Guy didn't say anything
but went AKF for over half an hour.  Just let his char sit there soaking up
exp and doing nothing.  How do I know,  He didn't stand, move or anything.
Just sat there.  We had a bad pull and he didn't say or do anything.  A few
comments such as "yo!  are you there?"  with no response.  Someone left
group, we got a replacement and no invite.

Guy finally gets back, resets the group (appologizing ,etc...) we get
rolling again and almost immediately he starts up with the just sitting.
This time we broke group and reformed.  Guy sat there for over half an hour
before getting up and asking "what's up?"...

That is taking exp and not contributing or just "on the take".
