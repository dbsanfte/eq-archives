Yes, maybe you should have backed up, but it sounds like he didn't give 2
shits if you lived or died.  He should have at least jumped in to battle and
used lifedraw and leach.
Can't heal you?  Necros have at least a weak heal spell by level 12.

you said you were going to.

Yep.

> Him: u wanted to pull it dont blame ur death on me. learn to play

You learn to play?  You've coherently explained enough to prove to me at
least you met up with a complete donkey.

> Me: ME learn to play? You're the one who didn't do what you said you were
going to.
> Him: i said id dot and fear it i didnt say continuous

If only you could go back at this point, hit the mob only ONCE, let the
necro draw the aggro and get killed.  You could have told him after, "I
didn't say I would *keep* hitting it!"  Actually you probably should have
stayed in the group long enough to do this after your corpse run.

It's too bad we sometimes can't go back and do this part first.

Hoping to have better luck than DT tonight,
