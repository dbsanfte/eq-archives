Very offtopic, but what the hell hehe.

Started DJing around '90 when the whole alternative scene was thriving.
Trying to place what I was DJing around 96 and just before...

Sanctuary (King's Head) Sat
Danse Macabre (St. Mortiz) Thurs
Masquerade (Camden Underworld) Thurs
Demonia (The Albion) Tues
Planet Earth (Slimelight) Weds
Planet Earth (The Wag) Friday
Malice Underground (Gossips) Tuesday
Tenebrae Tarentella (Gossips) Friday monthly

Not all at the same time, but at it's height I was resident for 3 clubs
a week, plus a couple of guest slots at places like Slimelight. The big
one was the upstairs floor of the Wag on a Friday night (Planet Earth)
before the management decided they'd make more cash charging $15 a head
to the 'normal' people. Then a year or so ago, the famous Wag, went the
same way as the famous Marquee (both locations) and go bought up by
trendy 'theme pub' chains. 

Pretty much got the 'full set' after a couple of guest slots at Full
Tilt at the Electric Ballroom, as well as a couple of full nights DJing
the Spa on Whitby weekend. Malice is celebrating it's 6th birthday in a
couple of weeks, and though not the fullest club in existence, we're
still there playing what we like for the hell of it, and stubbornly
refuse to stop ):oP.
