Most of the people I group with also tend to avoid rescue missions for
a couple of reasons. All of these are from people who's judgement I
trust so I tend to believe them:
- Bad pathing. I know of one group that spent 15 minutes at the zone
line trying to end the mission. There's also the pathing problems you
run into while trying to lead the rescuee back. 
- Strange agro. Wiping as soon as you hail the rescue mob because mobs
in a room behind them agro on it. ... admittedly easy to get around
when you know this one ahead of time. 
- Refusal to move. When the rescuee refuses to move due to a mob being
too close. Especially if it's a complicated dungeon like GuK or the
spider lair in MIR it's easy to miss a mob w/o a map. Mobs can get
stuck in a wall, some passages loop so that a long passage can be out
of range but a dead-end room at the end loops back close enough to
keep a mob from moving. 
- Long ass linear dungeons where you might have to clear 100+ mobs to
get to the rescuee.

Groups I'm in tend to avoid rescue and low-count collections. Both
because if you loose, it usually comes down to things beyond your
control. For a high risk adventure, I'd rather just try hard.

I wish they'd balance them another way, lets say you set the base
points at 45 (instead of 51) for a 65 adventure, but added points
based on the frequency that people have done them in the past week.
For example:
Slaughter  	- 45 points
Collection 	- 50 points
Assassinate 	- 55 points
Rescue 		- 60 points
... if you assume that's the frequency (in descending order) that
people do certain types of missions.
