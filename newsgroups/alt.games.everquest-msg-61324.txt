I'm in PA, too, and have been having horrendous times getting past the
Character Select screen. I'm on the Tunare server, usually trying to get
into Greater Faydark, and usually failing. I've been stuck since Sunday
when I zoned from Butcherblock to Greater Faydark and lost the
connection. I had ONE moment of success last night and surprisingly
found myself in the Butcherblock exit looking toward Greater Faydark. I
ran 3 steps down the path and was disconnected. I still haven't been
able to get back in. I'm really getting frustrated and the customer
support is nonexistent.
