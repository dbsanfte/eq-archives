Wow I just read somewhere that if your pet kills NPC  over 50% that
you wont get exp.  Is this true?  I let the pet do the melee and I
nuke. I slow, root, debuff Is this enough?  I was at Lake of ill Omen
Snark Fort and where blue to me).   I noticed that I was not getting
much exp. using this method.When I fight  fight I use a Sacrificial
Dagger.  If not right weapon any suggestions?  Im in CC now.  32
enchanter.  Have a shaman partner also at 32 (Started toghether)
Should I try a different tactic?  Thanks for any input
