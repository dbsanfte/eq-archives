the level limit in name is still 60th, even with SOL coming out.  who knows
what the new skills post 60th allow you to achieve though.  In terms of
farming, I don't think it really matters to the economy who farms the FBSS
as long as its being farmed at a constant rate.  I guess having higher level
people means its more likely to be farmed all the time.
