As a druid you can do a similar thing, grab a KEI off your friendly
neighbourhood chanter and wave goodbye to the superbuffed warriors.
You can zip along solo, without having to group with these guys.
Or alternatively, meet up with some other druids or some necros, get a DoT
strike force together and you will be zipping past the very same warriors in
the level-race in no time at all.
