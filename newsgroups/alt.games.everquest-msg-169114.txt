Well of course it is theft--we can't do circuses any more to placate the
rabble, so we give them free TVs, cable, beer, and a place to enjoy it all. 

Get with the program!

But then.... rich people would only pay for what they use--instead of
subsidizing the lazy!

You forgot all the hidden taxes thrown in. The loaf of bread you buy has had
the wheat farmer's earnings taxed,  the gas and road tax paid to transport it,
along with the tax on the wages of the truck driver, the taxes on the energy to
mill it into bread, and the taxes on the wages and equipment used in that part
of the process, the transporting of the bread to market with those taxes, the
taxes on the store property and wages and energy. Plus, they have to pay
someone to calculate all those taxes. Each tax, as people want to be
compensated for the tax taken from them, drives the price of the loaf of bread
higher.

If course, then the government is kind enough to not tax the bread when you buy
it because it is food, and government doesn't want to tax food ;)
