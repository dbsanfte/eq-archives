Pppphhhhtttt.

They were slapping me on the back too.  To the tune of 150ish per hit,
double hitting as I recall.

I was lucky and managed to gate out while being slapped on the back by them,
one more hit, and I would have gone down.  First gate attempt I channelled
through it, I would not have been able to try a second time.
