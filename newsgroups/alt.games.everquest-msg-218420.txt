Aha, if indeed you will start at 100 mana, then my arguement
collapses.

Do you retract any statements you may have made accidentally in
the past stating that you pull at (for example) 30m, that you
zone in at (for example) 30M, so on and so forth?

Yes, yes, yes, I'm willing to pull at under 80M, IF you are
pulling at under 30M.  Group B pulls at 50M more than your group
at all times, as long as we wait for your group to get under 50M
first.  If it takes you an hour to get under 50M, then I retract
my statement; again, the entire point I'm discussing is the one
where you get your group LOM and keep it there for a long period
of time.  If you don't do that, then you seem to agree with me
that doing so is silly and pointless, and the entire argument
evaporates.

Yes, discussions where you start at over 50M won't work for the
purposes of the arguement I'm trying to make.  Keep pulling.  You
are already down to 60m, call me when you hit 50.

If you start at 50M and I start at 100M, then when you get to 30M
I'm at 80M.  I long ago abandoned (for the sake of this
discussion) the idea that I'm going to stick at 80M; you go to
20M group B goes to 70M, you go to 10M, group B goes to 60M.  You
go to OOM, group B goes to 50M.

You still have it in your head that Group B stops at 80M... but
that approach was advanced under the impression that your group
stopped at 30M; note the difference was 50M, just as it is now,
but a better understanding of your technique meant altering the
description of what group B does as well.

You are now arguing an old point; this is a form of the straw man
as well: its NOT the point currently under the microscope.

Either you really don't understand what I'm saying, or you are
deliberately misconstruing it in order to appear to be making a
point. 

Do you get it yet?

No, I'm going to continue to point out that you aren't getting
it.  The same -except- for one difference.

I -could- come up with a "group X" that plays differently than
you in ten ways, instead of just in one way.  But then it would
be incredibly difficult to focus on any one of those ways.  So
instead, Group B, which plays like you in 9 of those ways, and
NOT like you in only one.

If you don't play as I'm portraying you, lets try to agree on how
you -do- play, where you end up pulling at 30M and under while
your cleric screams "LOM HOLD PULLS".

I don't care about the times where you have more than 50M and are
pulling.  Keep going, if you do the whole mission without getting
under 50M for any real length of time (not for one or two mobs,
mind you, for 15 minutes plus), then I'm not playing your way,
you are playing my way.  But if you eventually get around to
going under 50M and staying there for room after room after room
after room, now we have something to talk about.  I recall you
saying you'd zone in with the cleric at 30M, which I thought
really clarified things; you'd be at the "under 50M" point from
the beginnning.  Was that someone else?
