Yes, from level 9-65 compared to most other classes. (1-8 you don't
have your warder yet) The levels between Warder upgrades can be a
drag, but overall BLs are one of the best solo classes in EQ.

>2. Are beastlords valuable to groups?  If so in which role?

Many roles. BLs can heal (Ranger class heals), SoW (level30), Slow
(not great but better than nothing), park adds with pet, etc, etc Very
versatile class that can fill-in many roles. At 44 you get your firts
mana/hp regen spell (3pts a tick), that stacks with all other mana and
regen spells. It makes BLs very welcome in groups :)

>3. Are they fun?

Yes!

Tough call. The greatest strength of the BL class is the "manaless"
damage over time. Tanking along side your pet, is incredibly
efficient. Stepping back to bind wounds or cast heals (on self or pet)
then rejoining the fight is the bread and butter of BL combat. Keeping
your health ,mana and pet at 50% while killing a constant chain of
single-pulled dark blues is tons of fun :)

For stats I would try make sure STA is at least 100 (all other stats
75min) then dump the rest in Wisdom. As a leather class STR is not a
major issue.

>5. I know they recently changed how pets are summoned buffed (and cant
>zone with you now).  How exactly does that work?

It works just like a necro or mage (without needing a bone chip or
malachite). You cast your highest level Warder spell, and summon a
warder. You then have to apply any other buffs you wish to use, such
as the DD/Taunt Warder process buffs, SoW, etc.

>6. Race, which is the preferred race for Beastlords?  Iksars look nice as

 *ALL* BL races are good. Pick the race you like the best and go for
it.
