Well, the problem with third-person kiting is not so much an illusion of 
perspective, but the fact that your framerate goes down (there is one 
more character and a lot more environment to draw) and hence the client 
is asking the server for position updates less often, so you *are*, in 
fact, moving slower.

All other things being equal, you can time two players in a race, one on 
a POS PC like mine, and another one in a state-of-the-art PC, and the 
one with the better rig will move faster. I've definitely noticed a 
decrease in running speed since I downgraded my PC.
