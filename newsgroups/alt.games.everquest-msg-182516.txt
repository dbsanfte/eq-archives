A level 52 wizard cannot do it.  My wizard is 56 now, and he can stay ahead
of the pops on one island (2 quads) with KEI, but could not do 3 quads
faster than they pop, and the 2 islands together would require 4 quads.  If
a single wizard in his lower 50s claims both islands, he's not staying ahead
of the spawns, I guarantee it.
