Lol. If you want to suck, open the door in ToV/HoT while they fight
the entrance mobs behind it. Been there, done that. To my defense, I
was there first time and asked the guid about 10 times on what I should
know there. I got an answer to 'not open the door'. Well .. assumed a
different door. That was stupid. On the other hand, there was a wipout
anyway, as the door mobs owned us aready and I was trying to 'hide around
a corner' as I had been advised to earlier. Well, I guess I know better
now and never open this door nowadays unless I have ten 'SAFE TO OPEN'
comments .. in caps :P
