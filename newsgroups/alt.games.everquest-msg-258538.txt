These 3 explain why the GoD armor doesn't have faerune on it like PoP
armor did. Seems they want to make people grind out AA to get back the
benefits they had from the elemental helm. Swapping in a very poorly
statted item to get eb is much less attractive in the high end raiding
game, though I haven't heard of a underwater zone in Oow so eb may be of
minor interest. It was essential for plane of water, of course.
