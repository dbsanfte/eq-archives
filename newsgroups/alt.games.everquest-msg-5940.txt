Can anyone tell me what stat or stats affect how fast you get increases in
weapons skills (i think it is DEX but not sure if that is correct or if
there are others).  Is there a "magic number" that I should get that stat to
for the best results?

Just picked up a Stalag Terror Spine Spear (for 500pp which I think is a
good deal as I have seen it listed as going for over 2500pp) but my skill in
pierce is only around 45 or so at 25th.

Thanks,
Charles
