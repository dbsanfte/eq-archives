Ditto, just reproduced the experiment on my cleric.  Started CH,
moved enough that it ended up interrupted.  Was still at full mana
when was over.  Ditto for interrupting by various other methods.
Didn't happen to fizzle before my patience ran out.

I very much suspect that Chorkie is being fooled by the server-vs-UI
difference.  I.e., if your mana is NOT full, then the server and UI
will often disagree as to exactly how much mana you have, and when
you start to cast the spell your UI asks the server to make sure you
really have enough mana to cast it, so the UI gets updated at that
point and you might well see your mana drop.  But that's not really
a loss of mana; it's just your UI getting up to date with the server.
Try it at full mana and you'll see what everyone else is saying.
