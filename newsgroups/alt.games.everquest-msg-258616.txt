/nod, there's the first indication that you have a guy who doesn't know how
to play his class.

And there's the next indication. The guy isn't buffing in order to preserve
mana and so he forgoes the long duration beneficial buffs that he could cast
once and forget about for a while and instead casts two extremely short
timer buffs that require frequent re-casting, one of which was completely
unnecessary. Smart guy.
