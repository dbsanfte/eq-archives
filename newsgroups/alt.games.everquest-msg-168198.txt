    Right now there's a test case on Playerauctions that should show if SOE
reads the stuff there or even cares. The best merchant my server has ever
known, Tigerstyle, is up for sale. Along with the 4,000,000 pp he has.
There's no way there's another account on the server with 4 million pp on
it, not even guild banks. So when the account info is changed, will they ban
it? Should be interesting to see.
