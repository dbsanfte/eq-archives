    I've seen at least once where I left the dungeon, got back to the camp,
and still hadn't been given credit for the win. Go to your "view stats"
page, hit "refresh" - that should force the server to update you and allow
you to buy the spell. Or at least that's what worked for me. Here's hoping
you don't have an actual error.
