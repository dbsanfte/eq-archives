What I am thinking is that you have to have another piece of armor
with low int that you can replace for a high cha piece.  Maybe it
would make more sense to me if I played an enchanter, but with my
characters, I am used to thinking of the coldain skin gloves as damn
near godly (much like my coldain skin boots) and I'd be prone to wear
the int gloves and spend money on cheap cha jewelry in all slots.
Of course, if you really feel the incandescent gloves are better, you
could sell the coldain skin gloves and make a small mint...
