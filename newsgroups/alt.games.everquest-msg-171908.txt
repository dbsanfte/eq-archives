I think they're rare no matter what, probably why they go for over 100pp in
the bazaar.  You're on Drinal right?  I've been looking for some Luminant
Heraldic armor.  I have a 59 paladin on Drinal who could help getting
Essences in consideration of discounts on the armor.  I think I've read the
chromodracs in Skyfire are the best bet.
