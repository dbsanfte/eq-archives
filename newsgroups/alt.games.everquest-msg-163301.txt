Thanks for putting words in my mouth.  Saves me the trouble, or something
like that, I guess.

I never said I would reject grouping with a beastlord.   I group with one
every so often, although he is often off doing other things, or we already
have other friends along with us.  As I said a few messages ago, among my
friends and guildmates, he is the only beastlord.  Period.   I somehow doubt
that the exp gain with random dipshit level 60 whatever beastlord LFG will
be exactly the same as you describe.

Considering that we have about 10 shaman mains in the guild, (one that I
group with semi regularly) and 7 enchanter mains (two that I group with
extremely regularly) I don't think I'll be sitting on my ass waiting all
that long.   Not nearly as long as I'd be waiting if I tried to get the
beastlord out with us....
