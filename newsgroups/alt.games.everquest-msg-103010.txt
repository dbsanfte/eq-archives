There's a good point here about today's parents being overprotective.  Back
when I was a kid, I did stuff that was stupid and dangerous, and that's how
I learned that they ARE stupid and dangerous.  Nowadays parents are so busy
padding every frigging sharp corner of their children's lives that they
don't realize they're raising a bunch of selfish spoiled little turds.  I
let my kids be kids, and they're very well rounded and well mannered.  As
for EQ and computers, my five year old daughter knows enough about them to
turn it on, get out one of her game cd's, start up the game (click play when
autorun comes up, really), type in her name, and play the game.   If a
parent left EQ on the character select screen, it's only two clicks to
delete a character.  My three year old could pull that one off, but it's not
his fault for being curious.  Some goober left EQ on the character select
screen.
