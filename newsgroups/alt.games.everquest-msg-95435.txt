First off this post is not related to Everquest ( which I do enjoy) but I am
a bit pissed off at Sony and here is as good a place to vent. I have a Sony
Vaio Laptop and need an extended life battery, I called Sony and they
charged me $5.00 to lookup the part number for the damm battery. And yes I
did goto the website first looking for the part number it was not listed.

A bit tick off at Sony
