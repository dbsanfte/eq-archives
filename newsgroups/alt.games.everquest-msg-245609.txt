Maybe the player believes the only good Indiana is a dead Indiana?

Not necessarily!  If he can get a corpse in every non-instanced zone,
then the next time the servers come back from being patched there'll
be no instanced zones created yet, and he'll have achieved his goal.

The real challenge, of course, is that he has to generate all of the
corpses before the first one expires to the graveyard.  (If it were
just a matter of leaving a corpse *at some time* in each zone, then
he could include LDoN by dying at least once in each adventure zone.
Those corpses would just happen to get relocated sooner than most.)
