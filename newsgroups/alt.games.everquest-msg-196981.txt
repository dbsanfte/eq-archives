Fully agree... but we are talking about SOE =( And as far as I know the
rewards given out ( as long as you are no GM lol ) you maybe will get a
necklace with AC2 and a level 1 focuseffect .... (nodrop of course)

Again I fully agree. But I also think the needed trials are way too
difficult ... all is random on mobs and with bad luck you had 4 tries with 3
rocks in first wave ( happened to me ) ... even a full group lvl 65 would
not be able to do it ... stupid waste of time and disencouragement for
players ...
The levelrequirement would be great as it also works great with PoT and
other planes ... think you ll feel like in PC at lower levels ... packed to
maximum and many way underleveled players that cant deal with the mobs ...
( Here comes a train ... ). Access to planes should include knowing your
class/char and a challenging test (a fair and doable one). But i think next
will be the removal of keyquests because I pay for VT too ( in my opinion
the quests are way easier than the stupid trials are ) !

We ll see what the changes will bring ....

Have fun in game

Christian
