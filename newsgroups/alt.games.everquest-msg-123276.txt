You have a main "tank" who picks the target to kill.   Therefore the
enchanter (or bard) will "mez" the adds (so they don't beat upon other
people)

This means all the group MUST fight the same target - which is typically the
mob that your tank calls.

So /assist "tankname" means you are hitting the same mob as your tank - and
if the whole group does that, then the whole group is on the same mob.

Assist gives you the target of the person your assisting...  e.g if you
assist me, whoever I have as my target, will now be your target.

You can click on a player/mob (or press F2 etc) and type /assist
Or you can just type /assist name

Btw broken mezzes = dead enchanters.  And dead enchanters = group wipeouts
(imagine when it happens deep inside a dungeon!)
