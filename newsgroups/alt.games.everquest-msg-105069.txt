Sure, it's sad what happened, but I immediately lose all respect and
sympathy for ANYONE who files such asinine lawsuits with the sole intention
of making money.  Suing the tobacco companies because they were stupid
enough to smoke (morons awarded billions of dollars), suing McDonald's
because they spilled coffee on themselves (morons awarded millions of
dollars), suing Ozzy Osbourne because of a song (morons awarded nothing
because a judge threw out the suit haha).  How can juries keep awarding
people so much money for their own stupidity?  When does it end?
