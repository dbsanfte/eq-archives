Well, the point is that EC is not a city zone like Freeport or such. This
means Evil characters who are KoS in the cities can buy and sell as well.

On top of that, EC is rougly in the centre of the world, with fast access to
boats to Kunark, Velious and Faydwer. Both a druid circle and Wizard spire
are 1 zone away (2 wiz spires even).
Freeport and Neriak are close so good and evil characters can run to a bank
fast.

It's not that people decided to start a bazaar in East Commons, it's just
that it happens over time and EC is where a lot of people meet up. Besides,
the tunnel is a very easy to spot landmark, has no wandering mobs inside and
actually has a vendor that sells to everyone.

And as a last note: Anyone who wants to take up tradeskills has a blast in
freeport, but also has to go to EC and WC for supplies.


I think I said enough now, I'll shut up.
