Still - an admin is going to look at your report, see that the post was not
that far off topic, it is a non commercial, it was not crossposted and the
subject was clearly marking it for what it was. Then they will just delete
your complaint whilst grumbling "bloody wanker has nothing better to do with
his time".  I for one followed the link because I was interested.
