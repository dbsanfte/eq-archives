There are typos and then there are clear signs of pure illiteracy. 
Mine fall into the former category.  The person I was responding to
chose to resort to name-calling, clearly the act of the desperate.  My
point is, everyone chooses for themselves what they want in the game. 
Anyone who says otherwise is a liar.
I suspect Kiev is in one of those greedy leader-take-all type guilds
and can't stand the fact that someone actually professes that they
will call their own shots in the game.  I always have and I always
will.   Don't want to venture in Rujarkian?  Too bad... you're out of
my group.  Bye, sayanara, arrivederce, etc...

I also have let people die because they used dEwdsPeEk in my group.

DeWd:  "Will u HeAl me, pLz!!"

Me:  "Sorry, I don't understand.  Please speak English"

Ditto goes for anyone dying in PoK or another zone from a DOT or
similar ailment.  Sorry...

(And no, I'm not an angst-ridden teen.  I haven't seen those years in
decades)
