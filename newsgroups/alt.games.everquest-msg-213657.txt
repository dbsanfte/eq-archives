Oddly enough DT, you've yet to piss me off.  I'll admit I am somewhat
fearful of seeing your replies to my posts, simply becuase I wonder if
*this* is finally my turn to be reamed by DT.  But since you have yet to
do this, I still have no issues with you.  

No, what's probably more of a barrier is that you are probably in east
bay, south bay, or the city itself.  I hate driving, and living up in
Marin, the only way I get to visit folks is if I get my heinie onto those
hideous freeways.
