I am offering my copy of the Everquest trilogy for $5.  I really
didn't care for the interface, or the look and feel of the game.  The
interface was just overkill.  How many buttons can a person possibly
need on one screen?  I didn't care for the fact that I started off
with nothing besides a crappy knife and some food.  How lame is
that... you have to buy your own food to survive.  If I wanted to play
a game where I needed to survive I would have just bought The Sims...
LOL!!!  I cannot return it, and I have only spent 15 minutes on it.  I
thought it was lame right off the bat that I didn't start out with any
money or armor.  I mean WTF?  How good can a game be if I don't start
out with any decent gear?  I created a wizard and memorized the Frost
spell.  I was expecting to do damage beyond comprehension.  I cast the
damn thing and it only does *5*, yep count them... FIVE points of
damage.  Big deal.  After the spiderling that I attacked killed me I
decided to log out and not look back.  I've slated my account for
cancellation, and would like to find some way to recoup some of my
investment.  I would have invested in Worldcomm stock if I thought
this game was going to be such a disappointment.  If anyone here wants
to give as a gift, or buy it off of me, I'd be happy to part with it
for $5.00 (Plus shipping)

Otherwise, I'd hate the fact that I spent $40.00 for a online trilogy
of EQ just to have it blow up in my face and become a major suck-fest.
 I'm very unhappy with it and it's taking up unnecessary space on my
hard drive.  The CD's for the game are taking up unnecessary space on
my desk.  I can understand how some might like it, but it just isn't
for me.  The Sims is a much more complex, challenging game.  Anyone
who might want to buy it, please let me know.

Thanks to all who'd consider.
