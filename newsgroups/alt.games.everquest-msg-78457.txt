on ebay you'll find a ton of these lame items for sale.  I've always
believed when something sounds to good to be true, then it has to be NOT
true.

I've been playing this game 3 months after it came out.  I waited for all
the networking and connection issues to be resolved.

I've finally leveled one of my characters to 45.  :)  I also have a few
others in the 30s.  only play on weekends and maybe a couple days a week.
(3-12 hours total).

What ya'll think of these so called "plat makers"and power leveling guides?
You think it's for real?  I once saw a char awhile back selling 10-20kpp on
several servers with multiple posts.  I just thought the foo had ZERO life.
how can someone make so much coin in short periods of time?

I was excited when I finally had 1kpp in the bank just a short while ago.
Thought I could go out and buy cool items.  heck no...most +WIS items for my
druid are 2kpp +.

so, I continue on my merry way...saving for the next ticket item.
