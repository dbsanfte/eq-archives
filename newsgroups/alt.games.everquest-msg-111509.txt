Did you honestly think EQ would last forever? 2-3 years is an
incrediblly long time for a computer game. You are still missing the
fact that EQ will eventually end.

EQ1 is now 3+ years old, and will be almost 5 years old when EQ2
launches. That is again an extremely long lifespan in the computer
world.

EQ is a business period end of story. When it ceases to make a profit
it will cease to exist. You cannot "win" at EQ. A level 60 character
with all AAxp points and all skills/trades maxed hasn't beaten the
game. There is no end-game prize or cut-scene. Nobody but your friends
in-game will care about your EQ accomplishments.

Verant is not "ignoring the reasons people like to build their
characters", they are giving them new ones. EQ2 will be a completely
new playing experience in a world familiar to EQ players.

So? EQ is not about the destination (level 60), it is about the
journey inbetween. There are people who have played EQ since before it
launched (early beta) that have never levelled a character past 30.

Fan Faires, GM Events, and in-game content (guilds, quests, chat
channels, OOC, Shout, Auction, Tell, etc, etc) are all ways that
Verant helps to build the community. You could argue that EQ is
nothing more than a giant chat room with nice graphics and fake
money/items to play/trade with.

EQ2 is inevitable. The awesome success of EQ1 (400k+ subscribers) is
more than enough reason to produce a sequel. If the build it right,
then the players will have to decide on which game they want to play.
If that splits the community, then so be it. There is no reason to
fear change.

>funny that you write this paragraph after the one above where you
>explain "they are a business afterall"

Not "funny" at all. There is nothing strange about a business that
makes a profit and at the same time fosters a loyal and active
community. Being in business to make a profit doesn't mean you take
advantage of people or harm them in any way. The best businesses offer
quality product, satisfy most of their customers and still make a
profit.

If you think my response to you was a flame, you are sadly mistaken.
By turning your own words back at you, I attempted to open your eyes
to the hypocrisy of your statements.

>all bets are off once you start in with me loser, yes I picked up on
>your little flame too<yawn>

I have not even begun to "start" with you. You are hardly worth the
effort. My reponse to you was hardly a flame. I doubt that you are up
to the challenge should you decide to engage in any real debate.
