Warrior aggro is something that needs attention. But what can they do when
knights also have the taunt skill and spells that generates mega hate to
boost? Warriors something like a "ultra taunt" aa skill/dicipline. Kinda
like 9 aaxp yields double taunt value (Your face suddenly looks double as
stupid as it did before after this aa, so mobs suffer double taunt value
when you taunt them).
