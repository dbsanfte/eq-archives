Running pass the trader stalls close to bank I get about 4fps www.fraps.com

Clip at 100% (for the this example..I drop it to 0% upon entering bazaar,
normally)

Has little effect on Luclin models so off.

The bank areas contain that all the time, either your Bazaar is empty
compared to BB's (possible, BB is, generally, the busiest non Euro server)
or you're idea of playable is one of seconds per frame.

Peak time there are generally some 550 - 600 ppl in the Bazaar at 8am GMT
there 500traders and maybe 40 others (trying to become traders) I have never
tried it without Luclin models on but I recon I would still see a drop in
FPS to single figures upon passing the first row of Trader stalls. You maybe
able to "cope" with the FPS loss in Bazaar with your cfg but would you
consider that acceptable performance?

CF
Of course after saying this it reminds me of a friend who always tells me
his PC runs things fine at max res/detail but when I see them on his machine
I can almost count the FPS...Guess it's what you are happy to put up with.
