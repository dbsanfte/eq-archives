The exit from the caves in Gunthak takes you to a lava river you need
to swim along. It is a short swim though so anyone high enough to hunt
there will not be troubled by the lava-inflicted damage.

You can also get into Nadox by going through Torgiran mines, although
you have to cross the entire zone to do so. Nothing sees invis on the
route though which is good. Entering this way takes you to the outside
of the shrine which is the succor point in Nadox.

Nadox has long been my favourite zone; plenty of single-pullable mobs,
hardly any which see invis, reasonable loot and mobs which are not too
tough so that you don't spend loads of time recovering from each fight.
