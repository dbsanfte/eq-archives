You don't understand.  I don't play Necros or Shadowknights (or their
analogues in other games) because I have no interest whatsoever in
controlling/subverting/creating Undead.  I just want to smash them
into tiny little bone fragments, chop them into unrecognizable shreds
of corrupted flesh, prick the heart of their essence and laugh at the
frustrated howl of dismay as they fade into non-existence...  There's
just something fun about crushing Undead.  Why, I even took my young
Druid into Lower Guk, solo at L29, untwinked, no KEI, and thoroughly
enjoyed rotting some ghouls.
