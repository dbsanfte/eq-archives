Actually, my minimum hit has been 0. :) I believe that's because *I* missed,
but my weapon procced anyway, so it counted as a hit of 0 for melee. Just a
guess there.

Thanks. This is starting to make a bit more sense then. :) With my pile
driver, the multiplier, if 120 is my max hit, is 4; multiplying the 30*4.2
gives me 126, which may very well be the actual number. I'll have to check
back through my logs to determine what the true maximum hit with that hammer
was.

With my staff, the highest I've *noticed* is 40, which is 2.66666, which
means potentially, I can max hit for 63. Again, I'll have to check my logs
to see if I've hit for that as yet. I solo'd in PoJ this morning before
work, but wasn't really paying much attention to my actual hits. Was just
trying to get a quick half-blue-bubble of xp. :)

Hmm, this also makes sense; my ATK is currently 891 (goes up to 930 or so
with Yaulp V). So I just need to get my strength up a bit more and my ATK
will go over 900, which would be a Good Thing. I should be able to do that
with a strength aug or 2. :)

Aye, 95 delay is 3 times slower than my old hammer and 6 times slower than
my new staff. And I thought my hammer was too slow! :P
