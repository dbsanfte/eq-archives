Let me be public about my FV choice. I dunno if I want a Necro or a
Bard.

I rolled up a Human Nec. I like playing the non maximized
combinations. Lots of DE Necros, but few Human necros. I have a necro
already on two different servers though...

I am wondering is a bard would be more fun. 

As far as religeon, Veeshan comes to mind for the bard. What other
choices of religeon are a little odd or challenging for a bard?
