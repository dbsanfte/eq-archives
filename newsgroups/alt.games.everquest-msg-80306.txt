Just got through with this part of the Two Towers... I know this was brought
up before, but I delete messages when they get too heavy to handle, so have
no access to the answers, if any... does anyone know how they might treat
this part of the story? Will they simply leave it out (doesn't seem likely),
or will they do some fancy footwork on the computer (seems a bit more likely
to a non-computer geek)? And more importantly, will they find a "fit" for
it? Seems a bit too important a part of the book to just leave out.
