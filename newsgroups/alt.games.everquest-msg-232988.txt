    So, how is this going for you, Chris? I have to admit, once in a while I get
the urge to roll something up on a zek server, in fact I think I do have
something or other level 5-ish on Sullon.  But I know that I would be awful at
PvP.  If I see someone at low HP's, my urge is to heal them, not finish them
off.

    But everyone once in a while, I just want to go there, and I don't know why.
