Heh - I wish. There have been none for sale in any of the shops near me
since it was released. One store, EB at Cribbs Causeway, said that the same
person bought all nine copies of their stock on the day it went on the
shelves (haven't had any since and have no idea when they will get some
more).

I live in Bristol and work in Chippenham and just cannot buy it. The real
pisser is that Amazon.com (ie the US parent) have stocks but wont ship it to
the UK - just comes up with an error saying we can not ship to specified
address.

Oh well, it will be a birthday present for me (March 9) instead of an early
christmas present.
