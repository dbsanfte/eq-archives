It was probably played by a group of people doing 4 hour sessions round the clock.

I seriously doubt that it was one player playing 23/7 <G>

If I was going to try to win the race on a new server like this (with a 
group of like say 30 minded people) I would get a "round the clock" team 
to take one or more of the good solo & PL type chars to high level fast, 
say a druid.

Mean time the rest of the 30 work together to get some levels and help 
fund the soloer's early spell levels and equipment.

Once the round the clock team get high enough they start PLing, and or 
switch to a second char (twinked with whatever the first char has 
accumulated)


I recon that this would work, assuming that I had no life and 20+ 
friends who also had no life :-P
