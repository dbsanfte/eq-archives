EQ is about the journey not the destination.....

What makes EQ great is the fact that all of us can play the game we
want to play.

For me the game (or rather level progression) stops being fun after
level 50.

It takes MUCH more time to get anything accomplished. You are limited
in the number of zones you can hunt in, and almost every class is
forced to group at that point or face insane amounts of downtime.

If you are in a raiding guild you can find yourself "working" more
than playing. You can spend hours setting up for a raid or clearing
the "trash" to get to the Uber_Mob_01 that is the target for the
night. If things go bad you can spend hours recovering from a
wipeout(s). If you cannot gate/port/translocate you can find yourself
stuck in the bowels of a dungeon for hours longer than you planned on
playing.

Leveling up to 50 is trivial today. What used to take months now takes
weeks. All you need is a solid understanding of game mechanics and the
class you are playing. You don't even have to twink or PL. The bazaar
and mud-flation has driven the prices of gear so low that almost
anyone can buy gear at level 10 (or even lower) that would have made
level 50s drool with envy 2 years ago.
