Solstice earring is nice, but required level of 51, you won't get all
the stats. Does FT1 work pre 51 on this earring? Not sure on that one.
Here are some suggestions if you have 10 K already.

Earring slot - Forest Loops go for about 300 pp

Shield - Kunzar Death Shield or something like that, nice AC and
stats, about 500pp, could go Charred Guardian +9 wis here also

Froglok Scale Chestplate - seen as low as 800 pp, nice AC and wis
stats

Dark Ember weapon - about 400-500 + 5 wis

Golden Efreeti or Coldain Skin boots - about 3K

Gatorscale Legs - 400 pp

Nathsar Legs - a more pricey option

Othmir Cap - maybe 300 to 500 pp

Check out Jasper wis rings as well.

Anyway, you do have plenty of options. Good luck.
