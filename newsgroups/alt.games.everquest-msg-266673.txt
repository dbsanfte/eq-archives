   *Thud!*  Never occurred to me to check snopes, John, thanks for posting
the link.  *Checks Visine off of her list in the Notebook O'Justice*.

   So, I decided to google Silver Nitrate which Biz also suggested. 

   I found one link at
http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chemistry/smallscale/SS063c.html that says in
part "Sulfide and silver solutions are toxic. The sulfide fumes and ammonia
fumes are toxic. **Silver nitrate causes black stains on skin.** [my
emphasis] Store sulfide and ammonia solutions under hood until just before
use. Wear goggles and apron. Wash any silver spills immediately. Provide
adequate ventilation. Wash hands after the experiment." (This is apparently
a lab write up from a chemistry class.  It does not refer to *my*
experiment.) 

   Well, that looks pretty promising.  I'm planning on smearing the stuff
on a tv dinner, not cooking it on a bunsen burner to produce fumes.  But...
How do I know the perp will notice before they put the dinner in the
microwave?  I looked a little further to see what I might find, and came
across http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs146.html, which says in part
that they used to put silver nitrate drops in newborn's eyes to prevent
blindness caused by gonorrhea, and it is also used in salves for burn
victims.  Baby's eyes?  That doesn't make it sound that toxic at all.  Even
better!  But... I don't know what dilution the drops and salve are at, now
do I?  Poisoning is all in the dose.

   I click one more link at
http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/krubin/MSDS/silvernitrate.html.  This one is
pretty revealing, since it talks about the hazards of the full strength
stuff.  It says in part 
"Ingestion: 

Corrosive. Swallowing can cause severe burns of the mouth, throat, and
stomach. Can cause sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea. Poison. Symptoms
include pain and burning in the mouth, blackening of the skin and mucous
membranes, throat, and abdomen, salivation, vomiting of black material,
diarrhea, collapse, shock, coma and death. 

Skin Contact: 

Corrosive. Symptoms of redness, pain, and severe burn can occur."

   So it does support the notion that it will turn one's skin black, as Biz
states.  But now it's starting to sound like some pretty nasty stuff, even
if the perp isn't enough of a mouth-breather to lick their fingers when
they rove through some dubious substance.  Reading through this page, I get
more and more a feeling that maybe I don't want to mess with AgNO3.  In
fact, the very top of the page contains the warning "Emergency Overview 
-------------------------- 
POISON! DANGER! CORROSIVE. CAUSES BURNS TO ANY AREA OF CONTACT. MAY BE
FATAL IF SWALLOWED. HARMFUL IF INHALED. STRONG OXIDIZER. CONTACT WITH OTHER
MATERIAL MAY CAUSE FIRE."

   Ok.  I'm at the point where I believe Biz is right, it will cause black
stains on the hands, and that sounds good.  But the warnings about it are
scaring me away.  *Reluctantly crosses it off her list in the Notebook
O'Justice*.

     So... I'm looking at the Alum solution again.  I've only looked in one
store for the stuff so far, and De Soto, MO. has 3, yes count them, *3*
grocery stores!  And failing finding it at the other stores, it doesn't
seem that it would be hard to get it off the web. 
http://www.americanspice.com/catalog/item-20105.html .  This link says that
it can be hard to find, but they'll sell it pretty cheap!  As a bonus this
site has an impressive selection of hot sauces including Dave's Insanity
Sauce, which it states has a Scoville rating of 51,000, and the positively
lethal sounding Possible Side Effects, with a Scoville rating of 283,000.

   I've had experience with Dave's sauce.  I've seen a Mexican neighbor of
ours, who told Lenny that white boys don't know what "hot" means, cry in
pain and wash his mouth out with water under the tap from our sink after
shaking three drops of the stuff on his tongue.  I've put 2 drops of Dave's
sauce in a medium pan of bland chili and turned it almost too hot for me to
eat (I admit I'm kinda a wimp about such things, though).

   The Possible Side Effects?  Maybe it isn't liquid Capsaicin, but man of
man, does it sound painful.  A quick google of capsicum leads me to believe
that the only way I'm going to find something higher in the Scoville scale
is if I gets some pepper spray, the kind used for self defense, and set
that off on a tv dinner.  

    I bet 3 or 4 drops of the PSE stuff in a tv dinner sized portion of
mashed potatoes would produce amusing results.  And as others have pointed
out, all I'm doing is seasoning my own food here, if I use hot sauce. 
People use hot sauce all the time, for chrissake!

   I'm getting the urge to giggle evilly, and I think that's a good thing.
