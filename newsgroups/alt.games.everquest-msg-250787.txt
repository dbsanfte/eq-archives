If you can keep it so only the tank takes the damage (which is what people
should be doing anyway, but that's a different gripe), then 4 people
bandaging can be fairly quick. Assuming you're not grouped with level 40
players who are still carrying their first stack of noob bandages, that
is...

If there's only a shaman on healing duties, for the first few fights I have
the embalmers skinning knife equipped, so I can keep the shaman at 70% while
they canni. Much more efficient use of their mana.

It does make me laugh about the insistence of clerics though, and when you
look at the group you see a beastlord, a ranger and a paladin :-)
