Add

ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1

to you 'system.ini' file.

Its an old Win98/ME etc trick but ONLY use it if you have more than 128meg
or ram. If your running SoL I wouldnt bother unless ya have 500+ megs. It
was annouced by EQ but incase you wanted to know what it did read below.

System.ini

The system.ini file has several possible configuration opportunities that
can be easily overlooked as simple and unimportant. Who would think that a
simple text string, like 'ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1' would have such an
extreme effect on the overall speed of the system. What is even more amazing
is that this same setting has different effects on the computer depending on
the version of Windows you are using. All of the following settings should
be placed in their respective places within the System.ini as noted.

ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 - This setting has different meanings depending
on which version of Win9x you are using. It wasn't even introduced as a
setting until Windows 98 came out, so don't bother with this one if you are
still running Win95. If you are running Win98 or 98SE, this setting will
force the computer to use the swap file in a "conservative" way, which in
other words is the same way as Windows 95 did. If you are running on Windows
Me (this is one of the big speed tweaks for WinMe, particularly if you have
more than 128 Mb of RAM), this setting will tell Windows not to use the
swapfile at all until all of the RAM is used. After all of the RAM is used,
the computer will push off the most infrequently used data to the swap file.
This setting goes under the [386Enh] section.
