Not really a programming routine.  You can tell the compiler to produce code
that's optimized for use on a P4.  I think that's what they've done.  The
code itself will run just fine on non-P4 systems, but the order of some of
the opcodes has been optimized to make it run a bit better on a P4 than it
would if non-optimized.

On a game like EQ that has a human in the loop, you're not going to notice a
thing.
