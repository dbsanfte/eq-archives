    sigho, brings us back to the donating 50pp when you can donate 20pp
doesn't it.

    Circular arguments aren't my strong point so I'll leave it well alone.

    If I turn up with it, why should I put up with a drood in my group who
doesn't? He wouldn't be soloing without it, why should he group without it?
If I'm donating for it, why should I pay the casters' donations?!

    Mind you, I've never once complained lol, I'm really a nice guy honest,
but I have been silently annoyed to note that a caster who is constantly oom
does not have C3. That's DPS he could be pulling his weight with.

    I don't feel incapable of grouping without it, but without it I can't
cast as much as with it, for the simple reason that as an SK I'm either
contstantly pulling or tanking - I don't get to sit on my arse for any
length of time unless the group hits actual downtime, and downtime is bad.

    I can certainly group without it.... most groups will happily accept me
for tankign and holding agro, but I can also nuke and snare, and *fear* when
the healer's low. If I want a vague hope of keeping up my AC tap/buff, let
alone doing those very useful things, I need c3 in a chain pulling group.

    *anyone* can play without c3. Everyone should learn to play without it
before they get it. Agree with that. C3 should not be castable on character
below say 45...... agree with that 100%, WTF are they thinking letting lvl 8
people use it? Furthermore, to be fair it'd be great for even *one* of the
hitpoint regen spells to last 2.5 hours :P would be wonderful to see
warriors soloing stuff and having that option. They might not whine about
how bored they are then ;)

    Oh god, I just spent 20 minutes arguing for artificial turf. Ben was
losing his argument with me until he brought up KEI, damned diversionary
tactics! In fact, he convincingly lost his argument and everyone has jumped
on the bandwagon that although I'm dead right, my calling on KEI as evidence
renders my line of thinking incorrect. Ha! That's what I say to that.

    Augmentation for haste in your 40's? I've never even *seen* a chanter
try to pull that crap. God do any of you people play a melee? Do any of you
actually group?
