I agree.  I've been spending a lot of time in the Hole recently, 
and knowing where you are isn't gonna save your life.  After you've
dropped, you can't run for the zone, and given a choice between
gating, and one last nuke that might turn the tide in a close fight,
I choose the nuke.  (yes, 70 mana doesn't equal a nuke, but a nuke
can take the last of your mana and not leave 70).
