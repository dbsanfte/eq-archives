Here's our Gnome Walking strategy.

Slow Gnome.  Atone.  Move along the Gnome's Path.  Whenever a mob is
encountered, warrior taunts Gnome and then stands there and gets beat on by the
slow little guy.  Whenever the path is clear, Atone and resume walking.

While Mezzing would work just as well, this plan worked better for our raid
because we had only one enchanter, and he was more useful on the masses of mobs
we were facing than detailed to Gnome Control.  On the other hand, we had a
surplus of warriors and clerics, in fact the MA group had two clerics, so that
when facing the dragon we'd have a dedicated MA healer and a healer for the MA
group (including MA cleric) to do group heals against the AE.  This meant that
the spare cleric and one warrior could be easily sacrificed to GC.  Key element
here, have the warrior on Gnome duty take his weapons out of his hands, you
don't want to be riposting on the little guy!  Opal Encrusted Stiens are a handy
way to prevent HtH, although warriors don't do all that much damage riposting
with HtH anyway.
