As I had understood, they all stack as long as there is only one of
each.
I have a friend that we are in a debate, he says that :
He has a FBSS and when he is buffed by an enchanter (level 59 or 60 I
cant remember) and he takes off the FBSS there is no difference...
It is in his mind that they dont stack.......

So, what is the real low down... and if at all possible could you
refrence a source for your information, so I can guide him to it.

Its not a heated debate at all, and were both willing to be wrong if
that is the case...

as usual your time and information is appreciated.
