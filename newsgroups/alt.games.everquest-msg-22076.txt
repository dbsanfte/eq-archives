A minor correction to the definitions below,  America was originally meant
to
function as a Republic with representational government and Not a Democracy.
The people (educated or not) do not debate and vote on every issue.
They vote for representatives they feel they can "trust" to debate and vote
for them.
The problem is when the representatives follow the money and not the best
welfare
of their constituents.

Unless you have a small homogenous culture (the size of Sweden for example),
I feel that
Socialism and true Democracy are more likely to struggle because of
competing viewpoints
and those individuals that will try to take advantage of the system rather
than work within it.
That is human nature.
