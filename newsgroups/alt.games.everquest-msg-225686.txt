You do realize it is NOT an expansion, but a whole new game, right?  As for
anyone who is contemplating buying LoE let me give you this advice.  I have
been playing RTS games for years, I have been playing EQ since Beta, I beta
tested LoE.  They should be including this game for free as a side game on
the EQ/EQ2 install discs like they do Tanarus and that other crappy game
that they package w/ EQ, then and MAYBE then someone may actually play it.
I absolutely hated LoE beta, they couldn't pay me to reinstall it on my
computer, even if they offered me beta rights to all other SOE games I
wouldn't do it if I actually had to play LoE.
