Then they may as well drop it for all zones.

Can expect the first few weeks of luclin to be over run with the "uber's"
then. Anyone actually the zone levels in Luclin? I assume it's going to be
an expansion like Kunark rather than Velious, with a new race and new newbie
zones. Guess I'll have go and exercise my God given right to far...I mean,
explore the new zones.

The reason for the trivial loot code was obviously aimed at new players who
would be hunting for items as well as exp. By making the drops useless to a
higher level character (in that they don't get the drop) they kept the
farmers out of the Warrens, no, actually I take that back, the Farmers
wouldn't have hunted in the Warrens anyway because the loot is so crap, no
one would want to give it to their twink. I don't really understand Verant's
decision there, if you're going to make items unlootable and no drop you
could at least make them useful.

Banded costs 1pp per AC, Bronze armour, the same. Black Alloy 2pp (maybe 3)
per AC. Cured silk is now 1pp per AC.
Green silk Drapes are 100pp or less
Axe of the Iron back 50pp max
Runic Carver, Tower guards blade 100pp
Walrus tooth 20pp (this is basically a silvery war axe with +3str and
+6sta, the Silver ware axe used to go for 200pp)

These items are in the price range of a 20th level character and are cheap
because every expansion something better is released at the top end, moving
all items down a level or 5 in price. If they are going to do this to the
high end items then why not with with the low end equipment? Nothing in the
warrens matches the Drops from  the named gnolls in HH and many of the good
drops in Black burrow are better than the loot in the Warrens.

I can't comment on stonebrunt so much, have not done much successful hunting
there. I suppose Verant has made the best choice, it's player base is not
that new and with the release of newer games it will need to hang on to it's
current players rather than alienate them by bringing in a loot code the
majority do not want.

CF
I wonder if Trivial Loot Code actually meant that you would find the loot
trivial.

Oh, I am fully aware that had the loot been any good in the Warrens then
there would just be a lot of power levelling going on in there.
