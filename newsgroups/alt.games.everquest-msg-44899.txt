Last post of mine to this thread (see below) unless it changes drastically
(or we get a V.2, heh heh).

Kudos again, Matt.

    Even before epic, I would still rate Mage pets at the top.  They are the
strongest pets in the game.  If you are adamant about the regent issue
(which is a noteable one) then rate Necros and Mages as the same.  For the
power of their pets cannot make them second-best in the pet category.

    I would up this a little.  True, mages get no root spell.  Ever.  But
when earth pet is up it is a manaless, constant root.  Add that to the fact
that (good) mages keep those mobs' MR down and you have a very strong case
for adding a mage to the party if no snarer is available.  Again, your call,
but if this rating is something that you would use to show the
group-desirablility of a mage _and/or_ you are using the rating to show
people who don't know much about mages what they can do, this should be
upped.  Reason?  Because the strength of this ability makes any
clear-thinking group consider a mage to keep mobs from getting away.

> Downtime Reduction: 3, can summon bandages and such which can help

    Add mod rods to this, please.  They lower their own down time in a very
limited way but in group cases, this is way, way higher.  Modulation rods
turn life into mana and have the transfer rate of Canna III (I was
old).  --And they can be used in the outer planes.  Manastones cannot--
