I absolutely did.  I asked for help at least five times.  Names were off so
I couldn't call him by name, but considering there were only 4 people in the
zone and he was looking at me, I think he knew.

Heh heh.  If someone tries to KS me and it kills them when it draws agro, I
do let it happen.  The moment they try to KS me, they become my pet.  And
are entirely expendable to me.

I'm not usually this bitter, but I'm having a banner night here.  I also set
the entire DAY aside, my ENTIRE SATURDAY aside for a friend, and she didn't
show up until 7 pm (after seeing a movie I'd wanted to see but didn't
because we were gonna spend time together today), tired, unfed, then piddled
for 2.5 hours and I STILL don't know if we're doing anything.  I doubt it.
She has other stuff to do but just doesn't want to piss me off by saying
"can't hang," even though her making me wait is pissing me off more.

Sorry.  Bad night.
