That would explain the difficulty, although, at 30, I was damned close to
being able to solo blue Tumps.  One less resist would have done it the few
times I tried.  With your added wisdom, I would expect you to be able to
take them.  I'm not certain what the most mana efficient way is for you to
kite, I have heard that DoTs are your best bet.  I have tried both ways with
my Shaman, and found that nuking seemed to work better for me.
