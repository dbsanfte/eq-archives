I have, in the 2 months i've been playing,
    9 ranger (server i stopped playing)
17 druid
15 ranger
13 wizard
7 monk (hardy har har)  <--- nevermind though

The wizzy is great, because i can team him up with anyone and just plain
blow up stuff. The rangers, though loved because one is my first char and
the other quite refined, SUCK. Great dmg output, yet no ability to take
hits. What a baby! Can't really stand playing the ranger for exp. He's a
utility to help people lvl into their teens. The druid? clearly a superior
character in that he can be completely reliant for another million years of
playing. However, his lack of specialization makes him kind of inferior to
the wizard when i pair wizzy with any of his pals.

So with these chars, i feel the exp slow because they're in their teens. How
will I make it through the 20s? I'll NEVER make it through 25, which i hear
is a hell lvl. I've lost it! I can't stand to play anymore. I read every
online guide i can. Hell, I camped frostbite. SO much downtime! Its not fun
to play.

Am I honestly not finding good places to hunt for exp? Like the sucky ass
ranger, am i a baby? I'm pretty sure I'll resort to reality before i ever
get my wizzy to 30. And will I ever be 40? Hell no. Whatever was fun about
the game is faded; I keep feeling like there's something I'm missing.

I'm not playing to lvl, i'm playing because its fun to carve the
class-guild-tunic-wearing newbie into a little tool for smiting those
scowling critters. The last time my wizzy killed a blue, it involved about 7
intense seconds of striking it with lightning. But i can't JUST nuke! That's
not what it used to be.

I'm going to role play and say that i'm about 3 (and a half) listless
teenagers who are convinced there's no reason to persist. Yep, i can do all
the parallels and say that in the teens, even if you're only shooting for
60, is early enough to be like not even having started at all. I should keep
going. But I'm not; I'm going to camp (literally - a place known as camp
LOL) in a week and I'll probably abandon EQ until luclin comes out and i
remember the world of fantasy.

I'll take any ideas you people have on what i should do with my brain while
my hands are busied with the monotony of it all. /ooc hey! thats a great
quote . . . maybe i can use that . . .
Thanks
