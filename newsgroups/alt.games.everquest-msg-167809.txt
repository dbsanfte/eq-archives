Funnily enough, I owned a horse once, and since I had heard that it 
didn't stack with movement speed increase spells, I never bothered to 
test it before I sold the animal; recently, though, I've heard that SoW 
and SoE do indeed stack with the horse, which would make it a very 
attractive investment (although I would lose FT2 from the lvl 54 
Manawolf spell). Have you tried getting the Tboots to work while on the 
horse? The reason I sold it is because I didn't take it well to be *much* 
slower than before.
