I was hunting solo in NB Lair with my warrior (high 30s, everything
green or light blue except swarmcallers and leaders which were blue).
It was good experience because I would wade through the light blues so
fast, but I started to get low on hps just when I came across the
leader. I had not gotten the chitten yet, so I stayed to kill him and
was down to 1 bub when he died. I looted quickly even though 2 more
drones were on me and then I ran (sow was still good that a druid gave
me in Nexus, at zone).

Right around the time I realized I was lost in the caves, SoW wore
off.... This was not good.

I ran through the caves, back and forth trying to find the exit, my
train growing larger and larger. I eventually found it, and just made
it to the exit with about 20-30 drones and warriors on me and about 6
hps left.

I feel bad about leaving them all in the hallways for people to run
into, but there wasn't much I could do but that or die.
