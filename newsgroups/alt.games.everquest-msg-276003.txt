Really.. they don't care.

And they will never ban for this.

First and second hand knowledge here.

First hand: moved my partners account to a new server (she moved countries,
so entire address/billing changed to my card/address) no questions asked,
moved instantly
Made a shaman on an account given to me (back before they did the inclusive
packs and i didn't want to buy kunark and velious again seperatly) no
questions asked, moved instantly

Second hand: friend was given a druid by a r/l friend of his. Applied for a
server move, got rejected (billing info didnt match) he sent a reply saying
it was originally his uncles account (paying for him to use).. they wanted
to play together bla bla.. got moved instantly after that email.

I put some blurb on my account transfer forms about why billing etc had
changed, just incase they did ask..

When i made one of my accounts, I put totally fake name/address details in
(as I do with everything I register to!)... then I saw some account stealing
scams, and they were using r/l address info to verify accounts etc.
I changed the account all over to my real details (sorry Martin, the account
owner is actually called gsdsdjskdj..) which was name+address. Billing has
changed over the years, as cards expire or I used a different one etc..

Anyway I had zero questions or delays, I got all accounts moved without
delay.
