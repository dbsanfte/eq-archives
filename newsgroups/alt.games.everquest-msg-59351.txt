And that's why this is a skill, that takes quite a bit of exp to get.
It takes me over a minute to scribe my 8 normal songs, most casters
can scribe 8 spells in about 16 seconds.  
I think MANY MANY people have no idea how these skills will work.
Basically, you will have a *second* exp bar, that at any time once you
hit level 51 you can switch too.  All your experience goes into this
bar, and once you fill it up, you can choose 1 skill to learn/raise.
Right now it appears it takes about as much exp as going from 51 to 52
to fill the skill exp bar.  You don't have to be 60 to work on these
skill, you can switch back to leveling at any time.  The stat boost
will probably be where people default to after they're 60 will all the
effective skills maxxed.  I think resist boosts will be too little
reward for the effort in almost every case, but maybe if all stats
were maxxed at 255.....

Not all classes get safe fall.
Again, you're basically spending one full post 50 level of exp to get
this!.  (YBSOFP50LOETGT!)

One point of regen per tick, big freakin deal.  Catata of
Replenishment and c2 give 12 points/tick, regen while medding is 18
point/tick or something with med maxxed out.  Ohhhh, 1 point!

Except at this point you're basically spending 3 post-50 levels to get
this.  Big deal, so you do 95hp/bind rather than 63, you're still
capped at 75%+94, a whole 31hp higher than before.

You do realize that most likely these will have a rather long recycle

Except for Paladins and Shadow Knights, both of whom are generally
mounted in almost all fantasy literature.  They have been talking
about this for a long, long time.

YBSOFP50LOETGT!  Large race warriors wouldn't want this probably,
they'll spend their exp on something else.  Though with the huge
upgrades to 2hd, maybe all warriors will want this, who knows.  Nice
on raids with one of those 50ish/40ish 2hd I hear about.

Already have a discipline for this.

This is for Paladins, Unholy Steed is for SKs.  They generally get
very similar stuff, or at least equally powerful stuff with opposite
effects.

How?  It could be a nice effect, on fully-buffed, high-hp characters.
I see Paly and SK as the only ones doing this.

It's only obvious that they didn't break this down by class.  Each
class has about 6 specific skill.  There are generic all class skills,
and some just for casters or melee or hybrids.  As far as I can tell
these are almost all going to go live.  Basically they have given a
reason to get exp post-60, though I really, really hope that they have
some good, crawlable (rather than campable) dungeons that are level
appropriate for 55+.  It would be even better if the aggro were even
more level based than Velious, I'm getting tired of high-40s trying to
get into groups where they add nothing.
