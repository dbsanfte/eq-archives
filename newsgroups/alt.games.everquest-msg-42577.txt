OK, so I've spent many characters worth of life avoiding "good"
targets.  Now
that I'm playing a necromancer, I want to go pick on all that stuff I've
been
missing.  What are the classics, and what level ranges are they at?

Currently I'm at 20, and the only "good" stuff I've picked on were some
of the Qeynos area guards and the halflings in Nektulous. Oh, and some
of the freestanding barbarians, one in WK and one in N Ro. Hmm, and
some beggers down in the Qeynos Catacombs.

Mostly I find the "good" mobs are either green or red to me.

I'm thinking of checking out the Rivervale populace, High Hold Pass
citizens,
Halas residents, Butcherblock dwarves... any notes on those targets?
Any
other good ones I'm missing?  GFay/Kelethin strikes me as quite
difficult
to hunt in, as does AkAnon.  Qeynos, Erud, and Freeport are port towns,
relatively inconvenient to be KOS in, although frankly as long as they
are
free of see invis guards, not all that annoying to me.

It will be a while yet before I can go to Velious and beat on the
Coldain
and Skyshrine critters, but I'm looking forward to it.
