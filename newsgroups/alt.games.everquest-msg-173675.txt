That's why I was intrigued when he said "The GM said he needs help at his 
farm in North Karana."  The "Event" was in DL.  All I knew was that someone 
looted a piece of straw ( and it seemed like something else, too, that make 
me think of a scarecrow ) from the corpse of the guy.  The name of the guy 
they killed was also something that was familiar in out-of-game terms, and 
made me think of a drunken theif.

So, going on that, I told the guildie to have the guy take the straw ( and 
whatever else ) to NK and see if he could find a farmer in need of help.  I 
would have expected WK or EK instead of NK if he wanted help on his farm, 
though.

I don't know if anything came of it.
