You can always regain faction (except with groups that don't really
matter, like BurynaiLegion).

I wouldn't worry about the frogs, unless you have a huge desire to
be chummy with the frogs in Upper Guk.  More likely, you'll want to
hunt them too.

DE guard faction depends on whether you really want/need to do much
in Neriak.  Either write it off, or get someone to invis you and
sneak into Neriak Third Gate and do the Red Wine quest a lot.  A
very lot.

I forget what faction Lady Shea is on, but there will be ways
to repair that too.  Keeping, or regaining, faction is one of
the many things in this game that can keep you busy over and
above simply killing stuff for exp.  Consider it a fun challenge.
