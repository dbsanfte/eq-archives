Is that where they all are?  I have been running some CB Belts into Kaladrim
for experience and profit, and I've noticed there are hardly any noobies in
the noobie area.  I started a little over a 2 years ago, played up to about
level 8, then started a series of layoffs.  Being out of work, I stopped
playing.  Just came back to it about a month and a half ago.  Found out my
wizard, now level 12, isn't quite the desired beast he once was.  The other
thing I've noticed is it's rare to see noobies.  You go through a noobie
zone and the wee critters are running around the place like they own it,
because there's no newbies killing them.  It's definitely a different game.

Cheers,
Eric
