Not really an option, as of quite a few patches ago.

Well, obviously, the odds aren't going to be very good, if its main 
purpose is to be a plat sink. Me, personally, I plan to blow around 9k 
there it as soon as I have some time to play. Basically, I'm at the 
point where any *meaningful* upgrades to my equipment cost more than any 
money I can realistically make, so I'd rather take my chances (however 
slim) to get a Guise of the Deceiver. Failing that, Hanrahan will 
probably be on vacation until the next expansion...
