Common Problem one that I once had before starting another character
for this very reson. 
1. Keep the Druid it is beyond doubt the best char to have as a hole
card.
2. Explain that unless this stops you will /guildremove,  if it aint
fun whats the point?
3. Just say no. Simple and effective, and off raid time let em find
thier own port too.
4. If they cant seem to get the point and you dont want to
/guildremove try this :
Use the funds that can be easily generated from the druid and start
another char of a Non-porting class, Stop playing the druid and tell
no one of this new chars existence. Play the new char and have a
blast. Soon they will recruit another poor slob to do ports and by
this time you will have forgotten your problems cause the new char has
become more fun than the druid. Pop back up for raids or other
required events. If they complain ask them who pays your everquest tab
you or them. You will receive the amount of respect you give yourself.

Now I will tell you something I have noticed, good druids are rare and
missed terribly on raids for reasons that have nothing to do with
ports.  Any guild using you as a port beech is a waste of time.
