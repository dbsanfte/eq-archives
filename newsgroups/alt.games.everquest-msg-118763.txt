My guess (and hope) would be that they are new to the game. I must
admit that when I first dove head first into the world of Norrath, I
was pretty much on my own and saw loot that I couldn't use at a means
to obtain money to buy gear I *could* use. It makes perfect sense...in
a vacuum.

I have since become accustomed to and thoroughly enjoy the "brothers
in arms" mentality when grouping where you take care of each other. If
you group often with like-minded individuals (sounds kinda like
guilding :), it should all even out in the end with everyone getting
class-appropriate loot on occasion that they can use and enjoy. In
addition when I am *not* getting any loot, I can take pride in the
fact that I am aiding my comrades in obtaining their items while at
the same time watching my xp bar creep ever farther.
