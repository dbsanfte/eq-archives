I guess I still don't understand... why did you play, if you hated it? I'm
not trying to be a pain in the ass, I just don't understand. If I hate a
game (like Twixt, from years ago), I stop playing it. I don't even give it
the time of day for more than a few minutes. The reason -why- you hate it
seems non-intuitive to me. I really would like to understand, and if you
have patience to explain, would appreciate it. If not... well, I suppose
another soul has flown to the stars ;)
