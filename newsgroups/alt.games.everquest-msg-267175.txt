I dunno... SWG was very pigs in... I mean UO in space imho. Oh look, 
dead bodies lying in the middle of the street. How unusual. ((sorry old 
friends joke). It had the whole 'I don't fight I just run a bar as a 
job' motif going.

Hell as a 'brand statement' SoE is probably likely to keep EQ up as long 
as it will break even for them. Make it a value-add to their existing 
service; Here, sign up for the all access pass so you can play EQ2 and 
'whatever the hell they make next' and we will let you download EQ with 
all of the expansions for $10 to have something to fool with when the 
other servers are down. Don't forget to use /n00bbuff to pick which 
level to start at, with appropriate gear (and AA's if you are of the level).
