Then I guess I'll keep the ole boy.  He's a lot of fun to play and since I'm
used to playing a cleric, being in a support role isn't a problem for me.
In fact, that's most of the fun of EQ for me; playing a character as
effectively as I can to benefit the group.  Thanks for all the input.
Also, has anyone else had a problem with the /beggar get lost command not
working since the last patch?  ;-)
