If you hit F1 once, it targets yourself.  Hit it again and it targets your
pet.  Pet buffs like necro's Augmentation of Death, beastlord's Yekan's
Quickening, etc. automatically target your pet when you start to cast.  So
the issue would only have applied to the pet's owner, and only if he
happened to summon the pet before his mount.

Like the one about INT and WIS affecting fizzle rate?  When I created my
enchanter I noticed that, but with 230+ INT he still fizzles the hell out of
evocation spells :-)
