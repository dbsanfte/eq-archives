It all depends on who your main group of playing buddies is, IMO. I
have a 61 main, and 7 alts spread between mid-teens and early 50's.
I 'twink' my newly-rolled characters only in the very vaguest use of
the word. By that, I mean that I start them out with equipment that
is not over 200plat in the bazaar/per slot. But, once I do that, they're
stuck with that equipment until they earn it themselves, either by
drops or quests or some tradeskilled stuff that is passed between
the chars. My main is equipped with 8 pieces of either quested or
armor, the rest is really cheap bazaar items and all four weapons
she uses (3 swords, one bow) are dropped/tradeskilled/quested. And
I'm pretty much the norm for my guild.

Why worry about what others think of your stuff? I'm damned proud of
what I got because I know what I went through to get it. And I had
fun while getting it. I have more stories to tell other than 'Yeah,
I farmed X zone for 3 weeks to get the plat to buy this.' :)
