Jagged Pine Forest is great XP from 40-51.  It does get a little tedious,
and the loot sucks ass though you might get lucky and snag a nice drop from
the griffons, but the XP is really really good.  Fear kite griffawns til
about 46, then switch to griffons, and finally anacondas and black panthers.
The panthers will give faction hits, but they're really tiny.  I just ding'd
my ranger 53 this morning.  Did the last half a yellow of 52 in an hour and
20 minutes in JPF killing anacondas and panthers.
