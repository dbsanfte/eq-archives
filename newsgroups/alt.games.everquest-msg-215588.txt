However - at low levels (prior to 24) int does almost nothing for
your mana pool, which is not a high priority anyway, and any caster
(wis or int) with a brain is in getting hit as much as possible. 

An int caster's defense skill tops at 145.  I kept my defense maxed
through my mid 20's and capped it in my mid 30's.

I played a human mage (base int 110) with almost no int gear through
my mid 20's (I think I had 130 int at 29).  It simply didn't matter.

Mana pool is HIGHLY overated until you get to raiding Velious/Luclin
targets - and once the fights get long enough mana regen trumps mana
pool again.
