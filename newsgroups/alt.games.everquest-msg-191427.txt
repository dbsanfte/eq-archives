Okay, the way Dual Wield works is this: At the delay time of your offhand 
weapon, your Dual Wield skill is checked. If it succeeds, you will swing 
your offhand weapon. 

What this means is that it is always best to have your fastest, highest 
ratio weapon in your primary hand since it will swing more often. Finding 
a good equilibrium between fast and high ratio is sometimes difficult.

You should put the next best ratio weapon you can afford in your 
secondary hand so that you will get the best DPS (damage per second) from 
the off hand.

Ratio is determined by taking the delay of the weapon and dividing it by 
the damage of the weapon, which gives you the damage per delay ratio of 
the weapon. Ideally you would want that to be 1.0 or less, but there are 
few weapons that are that good.

So, for a weapon with a damage of 8 and a delay of 24 you would have a 
ratio of 3.0 which is rather bad. (24/8 = 3)

Hope that helps.
