That's a very true statement.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that
there's absolutely nothing you can do in character creation to gimp
yourself.

The way that EQ seems to have evolved over the past few years has taken
emphasis away from race.  Faction is practically meaningless with the PoK.
Weaker starting stats are easily compensated for in the bazaar.

The game has become a very gear oriented game.  If you look at a
cross-section of the population of lvl 65 <insert class here>, they're
pretty much all going to be equipped with something reasonably close to the
same gear.  If you're not wearing the prescribed armor or wielding the
prescribed weapons by then, you're at a decided disadvantage.

Which, I suppose, is why IGE continues to thrive.
