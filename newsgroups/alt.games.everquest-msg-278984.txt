In article <d96qa8024vm@news4.newsguy.com>, nouma@msn.com says...

The "flesh to bone" necro AA  (PoP I think) turns stacks of meat (which 
*are* buyable in unlimited quantities in places .. e.g. Shadowhaven) to 
stacks of bone chips. Its almost annoying that people buy them for 
absurd amounts in the bazaar etc, given it takes a suitable necro 5 
seconds and around 2.5gold to generate a stack. Or under 1 minute and 3 
plat for a backpack full.

If I recall correctly, I paid a bored necro 2k for 8000 bonechips, with 
around 1k going to cover cost of meat, and 1k for the half hour it took 
him.
