I think you are right.  As you said, the advantage EQ has over DAoC is it is
non-PvP, and look how many PvP servers there are compared to non-PvP in EQ.
Sure, there will probably be some non-PvPers who will be prepared to give up
that to go to DAoC but I don't think it will be great.

The other thing I don't like about DAoC (whether others have this problem or
not I am not sure) is that it tends to get rid of good and evil.  No longer
can Elves exist peacefully with all humans not because one is good and one
is evil, but that they exist in two different kingdoms.  If I was to play
DAoC I would probably be a Paladin, but then I have to fight against elves
and dwarves both of which I consider as my 'brothers'.

In all, as you say, if SoL can improve the game then I don't think EQ will
lose too many.  Even better, it might get rid of all the ones on just to
make everyone else's life difficult :-)
