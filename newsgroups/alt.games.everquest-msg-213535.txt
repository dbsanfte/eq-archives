I've tried getting a pickup group for the PoS trials recently (the lure 
of a charm-slot item and a free AA), but in several different occasions 
I couldn't find any people in PoJ who weren't actually getting good xp 
there. Then again, I do play on european time, so it may be better when 
it's busier.

As for the quests, I have to admit it's purely laziness on my part. I'm 
really not going to spend the time in the septic tank that PoD is (
intentionally, I suppose) killing placeholders to eventually get the CoD 
key, and I'm pretty happy SoE spared me from it.

What it boils down to is, I'm in a bottom-of-the-barrel guild, and I'm 
fully reconciled to the fact that I will never see *some* of the content 
of any expansion, but locking me out of *most* of an expansion I've paid 
money for would suck. I draw attention again to the operative terms 
"some" and "most". I think that the current balance of how planes are 
opening by level is about right (although I wouldn't mind some of the 
Tier IV ones opening up at 65 ;-)
