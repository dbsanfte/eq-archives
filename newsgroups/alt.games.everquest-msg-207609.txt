You are right in that DPS was increased in exchange for efficiency, but you
might be overestimating how much efficiency you lost.  All DoTs last one
tick longer than they are listed.  So, a 1minute DoT sticks for 11 ticks,
not 10.  Prior to this patch, EA would add 1 tick to any DoT whose duration
was 11ticks or less.  So, a 1 minute DoT with EA was 12 ticks.  Well now
with BA its 11 ticks, but each tick does more damage.

I think the new change is good for grouping, bad for soloing and vs raid
bosses.  Hopefully they will change it in the future, and/or introduce a
line of DoT crit AAs similar to what exists for nukes.
