i disagree.....and i know you were going for a joke, but the warrior aggro
spells were fabulous!

sure it's a "discipline" but we all know it's a spell

warriors can get "snap" aggro!

too bad they're warriors, and the ability to cast spells is lame

that ability kind of undermines something about the classes

so i think the warrior spells sucked
