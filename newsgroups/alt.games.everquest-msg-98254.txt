I could have sworn that I have seen you posting in this newsgroup for a
while now, maybe not long enough to have seen the usual patchday posts.
Everytime there is a patch several people come along and post almost exactly
the same message you posted.  That is why flames are quite likely from such
a post, people have gotten extremely tired of seeing them every patchday.
Usually several people mention the server status page as well.
