There's really no place in Seb to solo in a
time/mana/reagent-efficient manner. Sometimes, you can grab the "front
four" spawns, but I haven't found them worth the effort.

OTOH, shamans may be in the "and two others" slot for balanced group
dungeon raids, but the ability to slow MObs so massively often puts
them high on the desirability list.

One day, I look forward to being part of the perfect Crypt group:
Cleric, Enchanter, Shadow Knight, Druid, Rogue, Shaman. That day might
have been today, but instead I get the DTs[1].
