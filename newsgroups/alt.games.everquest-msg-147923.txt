If he's doing all that he's lucky to solo a low blue... I didn't
mean all at once!

On the other hand, I've partnered with a druid to kill low dark
blues 12 at a time, been in AE groups killing 50 at a time and
did kill on over 20 when one of the wizards went OOM and
the only things still operating were the chanter and my tremor
boots... Root for crowd control is something I've used since
very low levels and still find highly useful.  Dot hunting was
something new at 54, although its now possible much lower..
I didn't even mention Fear, come to think of it.

My point was, its a versatile class that often shoved into
a narrow stereotypical role... and then people get bored
with it.
