 Most of my suggestions will come from the perspective that you're in a
relatively good guild. Some you can buy or solo as well.

 Not a bad bag for a class other than a monk. The 3.0 kills the weight
reducing aspect of this item. A lot of times the things you have in it
wont equal 3.0 weight. At least in my case.

 Tinkerers Bag - 5250p with good CHA from vendor in SolA. 10 slot, 1.0
weight 100% reduction. Non-lore. Buy a couple.

 Dusty Ransackers Pack - Kaesora. Dont know stats offhand but it's good
for food and resist gear storage.  Lore.


>1 STACK FOOD

 Fishrolls!

 Maybe another Earring of Station if you're bored someday and want to
kill 1000 sarnaks. Personally I'd say don't bother and stick with cougar
claw.  I'm sure there are betters out there by now but I'm still wearing
two SEoS.


>NECK
>CHIPPED VELIIUM AMULET AC 4 STR 4 HP 30 WT 0.1

 Here's where guild help comes in if you can get it... Western Wastes.
Ac5 +4 (maybe AC4 I forget) to all stat necklaces are pretty common. If
you're not in a guild see if you can go on a couple runs with one that
goes there all the time. I've heard of others like Necklace of Defiance
though but I've never used any other neck item.


>FACE
> ENSHROUDED VEIL
>AC 7 HP 30 SV FIRE 10 WT 0.1

 I still wear one of these at 60 so I have no suggestions.

>HEAD
>CROWN OF THE FROGLUK KINGS
>AC 12 FIRE 20 COLD 20 WT 0.5

 Ditto on this one. I'd try going on a few FG runs and fight the
enchanters for a Crown of King Tranix. AC13 MR20 Effect:Serpent Sight.
It's good to have that and a froglok crown for situational resists.

 Dains crown is pretty good but that's slightly harder to come by. AC30
and a few more stats I can't recall.

>FINGERS
>2- VELIUM FIRE WEDDING RINGS
>AC 6 HP 65 WT 0.1

 Same on these as well.  Perhaps start working on coldain ring quests.
They start out a bit on the low end but they get better.

>WRIST BRACER OF EROLLISI
>AC 5 STR 5 WT 1.0

 Swirlspine Bracer thing from Sirens Grotto. I don't remember the exact
name. AC8 and some more stats...

>WRIST
>WU'S FIGHTING WRISTBANDS
>AC 4 AGI 1 0.1

 Symbol of Loyalty to Vox? I don't know stats since I'm an Iksar and
can't wear one. 

>ARM
>AZURE SLEEVES
>AC 12 WT 0.6

 Wont really find much better. Even using the Kael quest sleeves I think
I lose 1-2 total AC. They have resists and +HP though so it's worth it.
Compared to other melee Kael armor monks got screwed (For example, Arms
- Bards AC29; Cleric AC29; Paladin AC29; Ranger AC24; Rogue AC24; SK
AC29; Shaman AC24; Warrior AC33; Monk AC11? What the hell? Granted,
monks aren't tanks but neither are Rogues. Monk arms should be
equivalent to Rogue in my opinion.)


>HANDS
>CRESCENT FIGHTING GLOVES
>AC 3 DEX 6 STA 3 POISON 2 WT 0.1

 Iksar Scaled Gloves if you can spare the weight. 4.0 I think.

 Celestial Fists (Epic)

>SHOULDERS
>DROLVARD MANTLE
>AC 7 AGI 6 FIRE 5 WT 1.5

 Mantle of Fire. Nagafen/Burning Woods elemental drop from Cleric Epic.
Maybe Talendor as well but I haven't heard of it dropping from him.

 Sode of Empowerment from Hate.

>CHEST
>FUNGI TUNIC
>AC 21 STR 2 DEX -10 INT 2 AGI -10 EFFECT:FUNGAL REGROWTH
>16.5 HP A TICK WT 2.0

 Start working on Robe of Lost Circle/Whistling Fists.

 Besides that Icicle Tunic. Ice Burrower Skin (No Drop). Phase Spider
Carapace from Dragon Necropolis.

>FEET
>WU'S FIGHTING SLIPPERS
>AC 5 AGI 2 WT 0.1

Barbed Dragonscale Boots. Kael quest. Turn in a great (or greater I
forget) dragon head (Wetern Wastes) and get some nice boots. 

 Iksar Hide are nice as well.

>PRIMARY MELEE WEAPON
>FIGHTING BATON 1HB
>8/20 WT 2.0

>SECONDARY MELEE WEAPON
>CANE OF TRANQUIL
>11/25 WT 2.5

 Maybe a Trance Stick from City of Mist. Otherwise baton is still good
until 53 or so.

 Start working on 2hb now and then to make sure you keep your skill up.

>RANGE WEAPON SLOT
>PRESERVED SPLIT PAW EYE
>POISON 2      WT 0.0

 Idol of the Thorned. Droga. It's a rare drop and I seriously doubt you
can solo the Cheif room at 46.
