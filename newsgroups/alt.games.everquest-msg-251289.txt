I would say it probably about 50/50 with 50% of the EQ playing public
doing some sort of damage to their life by being addicted to EQ...not
100% doom and gloom like the original post suggests.  

If parents knew they could only pay $12 a month for their child to
fail college as opposed to $5000 or so a year then I'm sure they would
have bowed down to EQ from the very beginning.  (snort)
