Or on mobs that root sticks well enough for a net gain in mana
while you med.

I expect this to help my little druid on FV quite a bit.  Now when
I get three resisted roots in a row I can give up on the root and
just keep the mob dotted 'til it falls instead of choosing between
risking character death or zoning.

Hmm, OTOH maybe it'll just make it boring by further reducing the
risk.  But then, that's easy to fix, I'll just pretend I'm a necro
and start hunting yellow cons.  Which begs the question: will this
let the necros start soloing reds again?  (did they ever stop?)
IIRC that was one of the big whines leading up to the nerf.
