Just curious, I remember reading somewhere a very long time ago, about
exp modifiers, and how they can effect your ability to level.  I am
aware that a halfling warrior should theoretically level faster than
anyother race/class combo.  And if they spend some time in the
dungeons they get another boost since some dungeons have large
experience modifiers.

I also remember (this was a few years ago) verant saying they were
going to raise the exp modifiers for certain dungeons that were seeing
little to no use.

Paludial Caverns obviously has a very high experience modifier, but
the last time I had played prior to now, was just after velious and
right before luclin.

So my question is this... Has anyone kept an up to date list of the
places with the largest exp modifiers.  And possibly when it would be
most beneficial to hunt there?

Also since GoD came I have noticed a new thing called "leadership
experience" but I really can't find a good guide as to what it does,
how to get more, and is or is it not, a seperate thing from regular
experience.

I asked 2 high levels the other day about this leadership experience
and got 2 sperate answers.  The first was a high level about 50 or so
ranger who said, that leadership experience is in addition to regular
experience and will boost your regular experience gained from each
kill.

The second was a 52 magician who said that leadership experience ONLY
applies to Ldon and GoD instanced dungeons and while it does add a
plus to regular experience, it only does so in the instanced dungeons
from Ldon and GoD.

So does ANYONE know which statement is true if either?  Does it help
me as a lvl 8 magician or a lvl 10 warrior to try and start my own
groups, so that I can be leader and gain this extra leadership
experience (honestly I haven't seen any difference yet to anything). 
Or is it best to just try and get in what groups I can in the places
mentioned in my previous post about how to play a warrior nowadays.

I am honestly trying to get to 65 as fast as I possibly can, I know
that some skills will suffer horrendously if I don't max them out a
little later, but I think I can handle it, so whats the solution
