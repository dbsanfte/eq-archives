I don't know the answer to your actual question for certain, however, from 
your description, you should not be getting a CS rez regardless.  20k is 
the normal max fall damage since PoP came out, it used to be 10k.  I did 
get a CS rez for a 10k fall once, but, that was due to a bug, I logged in 
to Neriak 3rd gate, and promptly fell for 10k, under the world.  Needed to 
get my corpse back, wasn't even worried about the rez.  If I were you, I 
would get the best rez I could find, and suck it up, and learn from it.  
Given your description, and some of your later posts, it is maybe possible 
it was a bug, but, seems unlikely really.
