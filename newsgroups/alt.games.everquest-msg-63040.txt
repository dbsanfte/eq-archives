Sorta.
Anyone remember what Fear was like when it opened for the first time?

1.  No level limit.
2.  Mobs hit for quite a bit less.
3.  I honestly believe the aggro range of those critters weren't "I
see you, I'm gonna ass rape you!" but then I think #2 might have
mitigated it some of that.

Simiarly, anyone remember what Hate was like?

Actually, hang on...Hate got easier.  They removed all the stupid pets
from the mobs.  I used to dread hearing "Ummm, where's the pet?"  That
usually followed by "Shit, get a cleric camped NOW!" since the pet
just pathed around the entire zone and is bringing four spites, a few
rats, spectres, kabookies, clerics and the Maestro for good measures.
