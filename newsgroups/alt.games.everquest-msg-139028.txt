Tonight at work, one of the girls in the Chinese family who owns the 
place was helping out front.  She's a great waitress, it's just a bit 
hard to understand her because of course she speaks like so: "I get you 
a dlink of water, okay?"  That kind of thing.  She's actually very cute.  
If I had her for my waitress I'd probably tip her more just for being so 
huggable. :)  So this guy tells the third waitress on that he's only got 
66 cents left to give the waitress.  Then, as he's walking out, he says 
"Oh well, stupid Spic probably has more than I do anyway."

Uh...

Welcome to the Village of Idiots.  Please say hello to Mayor Blew on 
your way in.
