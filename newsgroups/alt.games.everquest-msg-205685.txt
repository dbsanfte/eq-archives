Aye, the groups my wife was in had some melee characters, who seemed to
have fun running after the bad guy.

Another real advantage of course is for pet classes, pets don't seem to
have any problem keeping up with the mob and you don't have to keep turning
them around or checking to see if you're close enough.

And you can see exactly how effective 'sitting' in aggro management.  Drop
a couple of high-taunt debuffs, run, sit, watch the mob (snared) ignore
everything in the world to catch up with the nasty sitting caster.  Repeat
and rinse.  Saves mana because you don't need to nuke to keep the aggro and
because you get to sit and regen some anyway.
