Skipping the point that there is no way they will make those skills go up
faster
I just have to point out that you can't put points into offense and defense.
Those
only go up with use, no option to put points there.  I personally think it
is way
too easy now to level up to 10.  That makes those first few levels of skill
points
lag a little behind IMO.

And your skills will go up just fine.  I just started a new monk and thought
the
same things you said here.  Forgot how hard it was to start over new.  But
by
5th or 6th level I was amazed at how easy it was.  It's just those first few
levels
that makes it seem harder.

And a new lizard beastie...Cazic Thule (and to prove my point on levels
being
too easy, 10th level in 4 and a half hours played. Completely UNtwinked)
