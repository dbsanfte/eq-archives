Oh?  And I suppose that you would go and med up in the middle of the zone?

If I "deserved" to get killed by some moron dragging a bunch of mobs in on
top of me, then I guess you "deserved" to die when your group disbanded and
left you alone say, in Frenzy in LGuk with not so much as  an IVU?

And would I think you would "deserve" a rez afterwards?  Not!

Sheesh, what an arrogant and obnoxious attitude you have there.  Don't
sugar-coat it, tell us what you REALLY think!  :)
