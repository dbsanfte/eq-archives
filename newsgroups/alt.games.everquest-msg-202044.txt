What can I say, my personal web pages are like your guild pages. Oh,
yer, I've called them my online shed to excuse the mess {:-). "a clean
shed is the sign of someone who never does anything"

I know this drag real well, both WWW and RL (club magazines, etc). do
some of these "free calendar pages" allow other guild officers to post
as well? (share the load).
