No, that cat is probably a stray hunting for food, since it is feral. Thus 
is the nature of unwanted cats.

*My* cat is the one scratching at your door asking for treats.

Pretty rhetoric I suppose, but totally nonsensical. How does one avoid A, 
B,and C? The only fourth option (which I did not list) is fix the cat and 
keep it inside.

With two sets of on/off criteria, there are always only 4 options. The 
criteria here are:
Outside? y/n
Fixed? y/n
