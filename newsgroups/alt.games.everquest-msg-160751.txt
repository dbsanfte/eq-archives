OK, I get a tell from a druid friend asking me to come do a rez
in TD.  A service I happily provide to friends if I'm not busy,
particularly porter friends or those smart enough to arrange for
a ride before they contact me.

I'm IN Grimling Forest.  I'm not anon.  For her to know I'm on,
she must have done a /who Bergh.

I reply "sure, pick me up in GF"

Then I jog back to the bank/port in area and wait.  And wait.
And wait.

Check /who, she's anon.  If she wasn't a friend I'd never even
consider helping her out, anon means ignore to me, unless its
because your guild wants to conceal movement towards a rare FFA
pop mob.

Thinking a bit more I send her a tell.  Thats Grimling Forest,
you know, not GFay.

Sure enough, she was running thru BB.

GF, to me, is Grimling Forest, the best port spot in the game pre
PoP.  GFay, is GFay, and its not somewhere I'd ask a druid to
meet me as they have no port to there at all... I'd at least cut
the travel time in half by running to the BB line while they run
the other direction.  More likely, I'd Faithstone to Kaladim and
run to the BB zone line from there, close to the Druid succor
point.

Maybe I should say Grim?  That would be more clear I guess.
