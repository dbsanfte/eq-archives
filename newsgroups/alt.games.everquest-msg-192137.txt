Secondary problems are of course that uber monks could not solo any faster
than any other melee uber character could. It was just that people saw uber
monks more frequently since the uber warriors and uber rogues always could
get a group but the uber monk every once in awhile could not. People noticed
good monk gear while they never notice good rogue gear.

There correction most probably consists of helping non uber monks while
trying to keep the nerf for uber monks thus completely negating the benefit
of getting gear or aa`s but at least that is a diffrent problem and may not
be noticed quite as much giving them another 6 monthes.
