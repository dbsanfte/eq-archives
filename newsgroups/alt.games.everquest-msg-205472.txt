>> How not to top post?

In a newsgroup where  probably a majority bottom post, mixing in 
topposting gets annoying, particularly if you have missed one or more of 
the posts in between, and have to attempt to understand the conversation 
from what is quoted.  If everyone topposted, it would not be an issue.  I 
don't get rabid about it, just mildly annoyed.
