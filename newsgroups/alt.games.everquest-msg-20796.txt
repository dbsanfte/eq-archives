Glowing black Swords are great, until 45 when they start to proc, then they
are good in the right situation (ie Duelling a Necro) but not as much use in
normal group play. CSS even better, I sold the GBSword I had, I couldn't
afford a Crystallized Short Sword and to tell the truth, I'd prolly try for
a better ratio weapon or weapon with a proc given then the price of the CSS.

Well a damage 16 weapon after 10th will hit your cap (29 + str bonus I
believe) so wielding Felhammer you are effectively wielding a dam 16 del 46
weapon.
After 20 you will find you hit for about double the damage of the weapon, so
around 68 although str can see that into the early 70's. This damage will
increase with skill but you will need to be in the mid to high 20's before
you start seeing the benefits of that 34dam.

Met a Pally yesterday with a 24/30 1hs weapon...not easy to taunt a mob off
him.
