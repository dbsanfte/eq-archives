But four days for assistance isn't really the best of customer service. In order 
to ensure that the customers are receiving the help they need Verant should hire 
more people to handle the matters. That is how other companies with products to 
sell and customers to keep happy are able to respond to inquiries within a day or 
less. It's not a matter of "I'm better than you so I need my problem fixed now," 
but rather a problem of "Why aren't there enough CSRs to handle the job?" I 
realize that there are so many players of EQ that it may seem to be outrageous to 
have them respond promptly, but a certain timeframe should be established so that 
we don't have people like this wondering whether they're the next in line, in a 
long queue of people, or have been ignored entirely.
