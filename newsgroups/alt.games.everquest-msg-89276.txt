Normally I wouldn't respond to a post with this subject... but
asbestos aside.

In Cabilis you have two unorthodox solutions. 

1 HB is the Cracked Staff, but better is in the Swamp buy yourself a
Survival Club. Not a bad cheaper sub.

2HB the SHOVEL, bought next to the Court of Pain across the river in
the merchants open air market. The Shovel is a decent 2hb. Plus you
can bury the mobs you whack.
