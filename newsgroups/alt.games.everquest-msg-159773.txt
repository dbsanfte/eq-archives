What the hell did you get ninja'd duing the Phenocryst fight? The
medallions? It's only three mobs and they go down pretty fast.

Just courious. We've done that one a bunch of times, and while I've seen

Geonids failing to follow the script, etc. I've never had an issue with
corpse rotting or ninjalooting.
