Relative level?  Is she lower level than you?

Proximity and sitting take a much more important roll at low levels, in
my experience.  Also, the reletive effectiveness of certain spells and
actions in causing hate will change over time.  For example, at low
levels a ranger/druid snare will often earn him near-permanent agro
unless he waits until the mob is nearly dead.  At higher levels, one
combat round by the tank will produce more hate than that same snare
spell, and snaring early is a good idea.

The best thing to do is just pull the mob toward her but not past her
and have her stand on incoming.  Later on you will get spells that will
produce enough hate that on your pull, she can remain sitting.

Is she casting anything on it?  Did she heal you on incoming?  Judging
by your log, it doesn't appear so, so I can only guess that it is
proximity, that she is lower level, or that she is outdamaging you.

Remember the reletive differences in your DPS will be very small at low
levels, and if she has a superior weapon, or just gets "lucky", she
might just be out-agroing you with melee.  If she is just doing more
damage than you, consider that at that level, she may almost tank as
well as you too.  And it doesn't hurt to keep her defense skill up...
