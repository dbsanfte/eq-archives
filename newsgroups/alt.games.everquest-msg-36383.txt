Non-competitive??  There are entire categories of PvP competition (indeed,
all categories except one: PKing) that take place on blue servers.  Who
first manages to solo that mob none of the group has seen before?  Who's the
first to get a sweet magic item?  Who really shines because they've figured
out the nuances of their class?  Who's got the best story to tell of how
they barely survived because of quick wits or sheer luck?  I find the slow
grind of advancement is an excellent contest in itself.  Trying to keep up
with my friends' characters when I usually have about a quarter their
/played time is quite a challenge, believe you me.  There is tons of PvP
action on blue servers, it just happens without killing.  People who are
competitive AND have serious blood thirst play red servers and like it.
People who are merely competitive play blue servers and like it.  Both offer
competition; the red servers merely remove most aspects of subtlety from the
contest.

I, for one, am nowhere near stupid enough to believe that total PvP even
approaches fairness.  That's the main reason I don't care for it in games
like EverQuest.  The discussion about fairness has been done to death and I
won't repeat it.  Some people like the bushwack mentality and others don't.
Nobody's right or wrong.  I actually love PvP, but I'm more apt to play
Half-Life.  In that game, I give no ground, victimize whenever possible, and
never give a sucker an even break.  If someone doesn't know how to play, all
it means is that I kill him more.  Most of the time, shooting a
disadvantaged foe in the back repeatedly is where kills come from, and I
know I'm decent at doing that since I'm usually about second place on the
scoreboard.  It is simply my personal preference to keep my PvP -- Quake,
Starcraft, Half-Life -- separate from my non -- EQ.
