I can't answer for the druid epic.  I started my shaman epic at level 25 or
26.  I actually did it accidentally, I killed a named dwarven bandit in
Butcherblock, and a lesser spirit appeared.  I know this is not how all of
the accounts I have seen say it is started, but I had read up on it, knowing
that someday I would be starting it.  I talked to the lesser spirit, got a
gem from him, and went on to Freeport for the next part of the quest, turned
in the gem, got my next gem, went to Erud's Crossing.  Turned in the gem,
found the mistake in the accounts I had as to the location I need to go to,
repeated Freeport part, back to Erud's Crossing, talked to several of the
right mobs underwater, got attacked by a red shark after getting my arrow,
gated out, decided I should wait until I was a bit higher level to continue.
Haven't continued it since then at this point.  I am level 30 now.
