You're right; sure enough, a boat came to the Kerra Island dock that
took me to Erudin.  It is rather confusing, though, because the Qeynos
TL'er says that there's another TL'er at Erud's Crossing to send me to
Erudin, so I was trying to find the other TL'er (who doesn't exist, of
course); she should have just said that she would TL me to Erud's
Crossing and that I can catch the boat to Erudin from there.  

Anyway, I got it figured out now, thanks!
