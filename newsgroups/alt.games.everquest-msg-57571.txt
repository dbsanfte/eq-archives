  As others have suggested... Karanas or Lake of Ill Omen can be good.  At
20-22 (I was a wood elf druid also) I mainly leveled off of crag spiders in
EK and Capn Surestout in the Ocean of Tears... he (Surestout) can be great
money machine for a 20ish druid.  You bind yourself at his camp, Harmony it,
pull and kite him, and loot him.  He's a quick spawn and often drops Bracers
of Erollisi, an AC 5 Str+5 item which, in my day, sold for 20-40pp fairly
reliably.  It's lore, so once I looted it, I'd either teleport back to the
Karanas and tried /auctioning it while hunting, or would TP to the Commons
or Faydwer with the main intent of selling it as quickly as possible.  Also,
Surestout's camp is RIGHT next to the named giant Gornit, who happens to be
an exceptionally rich, exceptionally camped mob.  If Gornit IS camped, you
might be able to make substantial money by ATMing for whoever's camping him,
or by offering to buy fine steel weapons off them for less than vendors will
pay.  Thanks largely to Surestout and ATMing for Gornit campers, I went from
being flat broke at level 19 without even having all my spells, to having in
excess of 800pp in the bank at level 24 with every single one of my spells,
including a few of my later spells that I accidentally bought.

  I also am fond of the forest giant fort in the Warsliks Woods.  Around
20-25ish you can solo greenwoods and evergreens there for decent experience,
as well as fairly good loot.  They drop legchoppers which can be sold for
60pp each to vendors, as well as giant grub diggers and hammers of
flattening, and giant tree flayers which you can get pretty decent coinage
for.  They also drop forest loops on rare occasion... less often than the
other Kunark giants, but then again, you can't solo the tougher Kunark
giants yet. :)  The only bad thing about the Warsliks is that visibility in
the area surrounding the fort is terrible... hills and framerate-killing
trees everywhere.  Once you get inside the fort, however, things are much
nicer.

  Hope this helps.
