So then my assumption is true then? A charmed mob would be a welcome
tactic in most groups since only ONE party member needs to outdamage
them to prevent the pet getting more than 1% xp?

One other question. When you give weapons to any pet, when they die
are the weapons lost or can you just loot them as with any other mob?
I would think you could loot charmed pets, but what about animations?

Thanks!
