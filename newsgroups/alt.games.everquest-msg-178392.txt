    Well they do get a thankyou, and more money than ill ever make from
casting one spell in total safety.

    Supply and demand i suppose, less chanters bothering would mean
donations would go back up.

    Havent a clue how much a 60+ chanter can make hunting, but my guess is
they can make at least 1k per hour with no risk (no excitement either but
still) sitting in nexus buffing people for donations.

    You can make an EXTRA 1k hunting hill giants in 3 hours because of c3?
My best score in 3 hours was just over 500pp TOTAL... Guess I should make a
mage?
