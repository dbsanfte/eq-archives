Easiest thing to show to prove the aggro fact is pulling in Upper Dogs,
Velks

LVL59/60 Pulls mob with spell or range weapon from a 3 spawn say, one mob
comes.

LVL58 or below does same, multiples come.

The effect of chaining aggro onto the next mob is evident on the lower lvl
toon. This translates into raids in high lvl dungeons. The aggro radius on a
lower lvls actions to a mob can chain onwards (through walls even) Also the
aggro generated lessens the effect the MA has in keeping aggro.
