The stalking continues!

I have, multiple times.  Your only response is to stick out your tongue,
hurl a few insults, and go "Nuh-uhhhh", after which you declare yourself the
winner (of what, I'm not exactly sure, but I'm sure it makes you feel
better).

Which, as I think about it, makes you sound a lot like my four year old when
he loses an argument to my seven year old.
