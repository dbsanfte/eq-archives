Well I wish I could moan about being a beta tester.
I always find it strange that many people moan about something which is 
voluntary and they could of left to others who may of appreciated it more.

I assume some of the problem is that
EQ1 was enjoyed by so many and the sequel is bound to dissapoint in many 
areas. Perhaps as a EQ newb I am going to be at an advantage.

AC2 after AC1 was a massive dissapointment - shallow but beautiful very 
efficient but limited I hope EQ2 does not go down the same road.

I remember on forums reading so many bad beta reviews about Horizons but I 
had an enjoyable 8 months (our guild leader left suddenly after managing to 
get beta on EQ2 so this could be a good sign for game and our guild is 
chomping at the bit to move over)

Well I for one am counting down the days for general release
