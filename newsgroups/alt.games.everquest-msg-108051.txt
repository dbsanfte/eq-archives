OK, this is funny.  Not really funny-ha-ha funny, but still pretty damn 
funny.  
Ben, seriously, chill the fuck out.  Accept that a standard greeting is 
perfectly acceptable to most people, IF it's followed up by reasonable 
answers.  If you meet a friend to discuss a business deal, and he opens 
with 'Hello Ben, how are you doing' do you call him an incompetant fuck 
for not immediately opening with business talk?  Do you berate him for 
daring to actually have some concern for social norms and conversational 
customs rather than getting directly to the matter at hand?
