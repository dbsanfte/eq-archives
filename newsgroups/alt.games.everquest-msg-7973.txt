Trooper Mooto at the Cabilis entrance in Field of Bone.  Give him 4 bone
chips, he'll give you a faction increase with all Iksar factions.

A small increase.

A very small increase.

Word is that you have to give him around 2000 bone chips before you will
become non-KOS to all Iksar factions.

You have to become non-KOS to him first, but that's easy.  He's on
LegionOfCabilis faction.  Just kill sarnaks.  Lots and lots of sarnaks.

But there are a couple of Crusaders that hang around near him.  Those are on
a different faction, and will still hate you.  They even hate my enchanter
in Illusion Iksar form.  They will wander off from time to time, so you have
to wait for them to wander off, dash in, give him bone chips (4 stacks of 4
at a time), then run away when the Crusaders start wandering back.

It's a quest that requires some dedication.
