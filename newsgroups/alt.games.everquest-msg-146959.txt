I was just curious if what was done to the Druid Epic Effect (Wrath of
Nature) was intentional and if so, why? and if no, when will it be fixed?

As of the patch on Sept. 4th (or at least this is the first time I have
noticed it), the Druid Epic Effect (Wrath of Nature) no longer has a snare
component at all.

It was indeed intentional. Druids have been requesting that change for a
while now. I apologize for missing it in the patch message, it certainly was
something we should have mentioned.
