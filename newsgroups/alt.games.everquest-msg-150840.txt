The difference is that the druid snares each mob seperately, THEN
gathers them all together close enough to each other to hit
them with is AE nukes.  You need to either waste mana casting
AE snares on single targets, or get multiple unsnared mobs chasing
you and lined up for a single AE snare to hit them all, while a druid
wastes mana by single target  snaring (assuming 4 snares  costs more
than one AE snare.

The AE nukes hit all 4 all at once just like yours do, only the snares
hit single target.  Since the single target method means theres never
a mob running at you without a snare already on it (barring resists)
it actually seems safer than the "4 unsnared mobs chasing you" plan.

Wizards can't SOW themselves, though, making them reliant on
druids, shamans, rangers, or beastlords, unless they pony up the
cash for TBoots or do the JBoots quest.  (Potions come from shaman,
they merely make it more convienient to keep SOW up)

Still, realistically both druids and SOW'd wizards are very similar
in quadding capability.  While there are some differences in
damage output per mana, you also need to take into account
the druids DOT capability (much of it clicky, mana free) which
allows them to finish off fleeing mobs or ones where mana has
run out before mob death, and wizards' wealth of different
damage types to allow them to overcome mob resistance better.

What I don't think you'll find a lot of support for is an arguement
that having AE snare makes wizards superior to druids with
single target snare.  Given a choice, I'd wager most wizards
would rather go with Ensnare (long duration single target snare)
than their Bonds of Force plan.

Single target snare at level one.  You can always be faster than
any mob you can stick a spell to.  Good snare at 29, but then
again, not many single target mobs live that long, realistically
you won't be doing quadding till 34+
