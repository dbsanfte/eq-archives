Indeed you can.

And its good for 3% exp in AA per run.   Of course I can get about 3% AA per kill in a
group in POV at 65, but its nice to have something I can do for short times online and
without a group.. in fact with hardly any risk at all.

Only trouble for me is  I have to train up to NFP, then come back in and root the one
guard near the vendor in WFP.

So what I did is do the freeport step last, with box already on me, then combine the
box.  Then try to buy a fresh purification tablet.  This fails because the game thinks
you have one on you.. but as you know, its wrong, you just used it.  So try a second
time, and she's happy to sell you one after all.  Now run the whole quest backwards
and end up at Trep with a combined box and all the ingrediants to go again.  Hand him
box, get another, combine it, hand it over, get double exp for only one trip to
freeport

This same trick works with any given endpoint, so if Firiona Vie is the hardest one
for you (at 35, running from DL tunnels to FV town can be scary) do this there.

Zoning also works to clear memory, but asking twice is faster and easier.

I bound in POK in front of the Freeport monument, so each run I just went to the guy,
bought item, and gated back.  In front of POT monument might be marginally better,
slightly less running.
