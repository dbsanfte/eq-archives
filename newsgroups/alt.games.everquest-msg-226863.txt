When I started playing EQ, my opinion on group looted items was that 
everyone should roll on everything, whether they could use it or not 
(NODROP items being the exception, of course). After all, even if you 
can't use an item, you can sell it for plat you can use to buy something 
you *can* use, right?

Well, then I joined a guild and developed a sense of mutual loyalty and 
commitment for many of the people I play with regularly. I have no 
trouble spending entire evenings camping a mob for items I have no use 
for so that others in the guild can get them. They would and have done it 
for me as well. I guess you could call that need before greed. 
Regardless, the loot protocol we observe to this day accommodates and 
fosters a sense of community and brotherhood, and life is good.

Now let's talk pickup groups. My feeling here remains that non-NODROP 
items should be FFA /rand. If the group wants to take it a step farther 
and ensure everyone gets an item before someone gets a second, that's 
fine too. It would seem to me that what would work the best is to have a 
ML who can link all items at the end so the group can then roll on who 
gets to choose first, second, and so on.

Pickup groups shouldn't be run like a guild event, because they lack the 
very aspects that define a guild to begin with. It's just a bunch of 
people who may or may not have ever even heard of each other temporarily 
joining forces to combat a foe none could defeat alone. There should be 
equal opportunity for all to walk away with some of the spoils that can 
aid them in bettering their gear in any way.

Now don't get me wrong, I've hooked up with people in pickup groups that 
I had actually played with several times in the past. We had proven our 
character to each other to the point that we would still defer to the 
other any appropriate items out of personal choice even as the rest of 
the group may FFA around us. Heck, we may even /rand with everyone else, 
knowing full well that if we won an item more appropriate for the other, 
we would gladly hand it over to them. This is as it should be. You want 
your odds at getting that +INT item bolstered in a pickup group? Make 
friends who don't mind giving you their chance at winning it, knowing you 
would do the same for them. You don't want to bother with it? Roll on it 
for a one in six chance like everyone else.

Throw the idea of NBG out the window for pickup groups and any problem in 
this regard solves itself.
