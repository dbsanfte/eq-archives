The B5 universe rings true. while ST is just another fantasy.

That ring of truth stems from its much more accurate model of humanity.

B5 is worth watching primarily because it is epic enough in scope that 
humanity becomes a character in the form of the various races including 
our own. And humanity done right is a beautiful thing; it succeeds on 
multiple levels, not only as a story in its own right, but one can gain 
insight into our own world and into our own society... on the same level 
as literature like 1984, Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm, or Brave New World.

Star Trek simply lacks that. It is much simpler. The various races are 
archetypes (including our own), and the conflicts between them tend to 
lack the subtelty and depth that is the result of pitting the black 
against white. The individual characters and plots are quite good but it 
fails to capture and reveal anything deeper. Worse, far too often, it 
seizes on the same small set of trivial epiphanies taken from Aesop's 
Fables. The settings are usually contrived to bring the conflict about, 
much like a fable, and unfortunately most of us have all had those 
particular epiphanies so the total effect is quite anticlimatic.
