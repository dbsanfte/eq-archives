If you say so. Like I've checked... or even care.

If anyone wants to show or hide their address that's fine by me. I don't 
care one way or the other. I'm not sure why YOU DO.

So? Theives are the ones at fault when my car gets broken into. Should I 
leave my car doors unlocked, windows down, and the alarm disabled to 
make it easier for them? Maybe leave my valuables on the seat too?

You call it cowering. I call it an informed choice. Neat how that works.

If someone legitimate wants to send me e-mail based from a usenet post I 
made regarding EQ they can just reply to a.g.e, and ask.

1) A half decent web-spider can tell a fake email address, and will 
ignore it.

2) MANY bulk emailers connect directly to the mailusers mail server to 
deliver the spam. When this happens, they can get the mailbox does not 
exist, or mailbox full, or any of several other errors *before* sending 
the message, preventing the message from being sent and saving the 
bandwidth. Further several will remove the address from the mailing 
list. (Although several won't.)

3) I just realized this one: If several people use nospam@nospam.com 
then the combined spam for all those people is reduced to one message. 
As the spiders won't add addresses they already have.

4) Suggesting that using a fake address legitimizes spammers is about as 
stupid as suggesting using anti-theft devices legitimize theft.

Think about the actual logistics of prosecuting a US company for the 
business practices of a completely independent non-US entity.

What are they going to do? Make it illegal to do business with crooks? 
Uh-oh... we all go to jail!
