Yes, buy OOW.

Seriously, I suspect that if you click buy OOW, that you'll be lead to a 
screen where you can decline to buy OOW, and then never see that 
irritating advert again.

But I'm not -certain- this is true, and I'm reluctant to experiment 
myself; if its worse the risk to you, go give it a shot.

I'm reasonably sure that if you -do- buy OOW via the advert that this 
will also remove that advert itself.

But please don't do that, I think it sends the wrong message to SOE, 
suggesting that the advert is an effective tool, instead of something 
that makes us want to visit SOE HQ with a sledgehammer and a spray 
bottle of Aqua Regia
