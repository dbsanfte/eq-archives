Honestly I tried to use SneakyAmp, but as nice as the idea was, it was
making my load of WinAmp all kinds of freaky.  When I would start a playlist
or whatever, I would get the normal play window, but the playlist wouldn't
show up for awhile and mouse would go into busy mode when I ran it over
winamp.  Then it would change to a windows titlebar looking thing (Running
XP) and then finally after awhile would be running normal.  The MP3's would
play, but I didn't have access to options and such.  Guess it just didn't
work for me.  Sorry Joe.
