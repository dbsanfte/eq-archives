Oh forgot to add, I hate the way my female druid and erud looks now but do
like my barbarians looks. But, I do have a gripe about the models, with barb
female model turned on I like her look but then I turn it off and she has
the barb warpaint on her face, that is not the look I want others to see
when they don't have the models on.
Now I will go have some cheese with my whine, lol.
