If it takes 30 seconds for the game to sense a LD person then you are LD for
at least 30 more now, then the 30 seconds sense would probably not save
you...  Most folks couldn't "cheat" if it drops you for being LD after the
30 seconds no ping from the client.

Only way you could save yourself via a "cheat" from it would be if you were
in way over your head, rooted and couldn't get away with close to full
health...  then pulling the plug for the 30 seconds timer to start *might*
save you but those incidents would be rare on non PvP servers.

If they want to prevent the PvP "cheating" that used to happen then leave
that code in place on PvP servers only (another exception to the normal
servers rules) and let the rest of us game in peace without the fear of LD
getting you killed with the frequency it does now...
