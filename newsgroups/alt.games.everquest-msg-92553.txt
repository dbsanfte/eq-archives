Perhaps the fact that Halfling Druid is by far the easiest race/class 
combo to play, and as such, it has attracted a host of pretty 
disreputable players. I know a lot of *great* Halfling Druids, and in 
fact some of my best in-game friends are of this persuasion, but I'm also 
aware of the fact that if some idiot druid runs their quad cluster all 
over where you are meditating, chances are it will be a halfling 
(admittedly, sometimes it's kind of hard to tell, if they are, in Wolf 
Form =)

Let's face it, Hafling Druid is the equivalent of playing EQ in the 
easiest difficulty setting. Playing a Druid isn't that hard at the worst 
of times... If you add Infravision, high Wisdom, an XP *bonus* and the 
best newbie zone of the Old World, you tell me what more Halfling Druids 
can ask for.
