I'm running with no problems using:
700p3
768MB Ram
GeForce2 GTS 64MB DDR
*old* Aureal vortex 2-based sound card
1.5GB swap file
dual-boot Win98/2k pro
All sitting happily on an Asus P3B-F mobo.
@320MB ram it was kind of slow until I added more now it runs pretty good.
I think a decent vid card and LOTS of ram is most important for this new
Luclin expansion.
HOWEVER, the moon zones still kind of suck, but I've been hearing that from
many people.

Safe travels,
Sean...
