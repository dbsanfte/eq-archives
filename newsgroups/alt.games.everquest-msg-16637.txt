Without a shadow of doubt, for levels 29-35, Dalnir has been a blast for 
me. The loot there is acceptable, with a few real gems amongst them, the 
xp is incredible, the mobs are interesting (nothing like being attacked 
by a big vicious blob of strawberry pudding to make you say "hmmm")and 
the layout is safe enough that you could hunt at the zone line or get 
ballsy and hunt further in. Give it a try. You can bind in OT (on the 
beach if you're a good race) and once you get past all the damn trees in 
WW you're homefree.
