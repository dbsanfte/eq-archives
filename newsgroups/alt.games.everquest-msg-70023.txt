Hi all,
Ok, so I upgraded to XP finally because I was tired to people laughing when
I told them I had WinME.
Now I wish I hadn't - I can't seem to get EQ to work as well as before.
I don't crash, but I am having some weird video problems.

I have a GeForce2 card, 1.2 Ghz processer, cable modem,  and I installed the
latest XP drivers, etc.
But now when I log in, the EQ screen is smaller than it used to be -- it
does not fill the entire screen.
When I change the resolution to 640 x 480 (or whatever it is -- the smallest
one), it does fill the whole screen, but then I have a mouse pointer in the
middle of the screen that ALWAYS stays there.  When I change to a higher
resolution, the mouse pointer goes away, but the EQ screen is smaller - it
doesn't fill the entire monitor screen.

I only have 128MB of RAM which seems to be a problem, I know, but I don't
think it would cause video problems, would it?

Also, one other quick question....while I'm logging in to EQ  - at the EQ
screen before you select your character, I always (and have always had)
weird sound issues -- the music is choppy, but then once I'm in the game,
all is fine with the sound.  Anyone else have this issue?

Thanks for the help!
