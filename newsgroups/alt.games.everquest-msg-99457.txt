Everything was going well last week.  I use Windows XP, have had a cable
modem for the last month (wonderful!), with no LDs.  Now, though, two days
after the patch of around 3/12, I found that I couldn't even run the patch
anymore.  I get to the 'connecting...' screen and it won't go any further.
I am networked at home with two other computers (both with Win 98) that
still play the game fine.  The networked computers go through a hub into a
router to the modem.  I have added no new programs during the time between
the patch and the problem.  I did play the game the night after the patch
without problem.
Do I need to re-do XP?  EQ support is trying but so far has been unable to
help.  Anyone out there with a clue?  I appreciate any suggestions.
