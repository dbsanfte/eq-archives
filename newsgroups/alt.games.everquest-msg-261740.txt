Anyone see those make lots of platinum guides and powerlevel at 1
level per hour of gameplay stuff.

I don't want to abuse leveling and platinum but it does sound
intriging.  I located one that I spend 1 hour deciding if I should get
it.  I figure the money invested is like saving hours of inefficient
hours of gameplay.

Advice and suggestions before I get it are welcome.




Thank in advance,

NT


ps. I was thinking about getting it at a website I got through a Yahoo
egroups message board:  http://everuqest.onlinegamingstrategies.com
