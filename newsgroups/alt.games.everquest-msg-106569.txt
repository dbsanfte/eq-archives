Actually, if you are above the corpse you can generally pull it.  If 
you're below the corpse you're too far away.  I've found this out dragging 
numerous corpses across WW.  Whenever I cross a canyon I have to be very 
careful to not get the corpse stuck in the wall.  If the corpse is stuck 
the only way I can reliably get it out is to go back up on top of it, get 
pretty close, sing corpse locate song to point directly at it, and then 
lev and slowly walk over it.  

I have done the same with lava, in Sol A, Sol B, Skyfire, and VP.
