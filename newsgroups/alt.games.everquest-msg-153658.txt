"Irregardless originated in dialectal American speech in the early 20th
century. Its fairly widespread use in speech called it to the attention
of usage commentators as early as 1927. The most frequently repeated
remark about it is that "there is no such word." There is such a word,
however. It is still used primarily in speech, although it can be found
from time to time in edited prose. Its reputation has not risen over the
years, and it is still a long way from general acceptance. Use
regardless instead."
