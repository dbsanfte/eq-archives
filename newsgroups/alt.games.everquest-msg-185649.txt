    I would agree except now it has lists for every class of all spells,
sorted highest level to lowest, linked right up front. If I want spell info,
it's coming off Lucy. The only info I'd go to Caster's Realm to get would be
"what vendor sells this spell", and that section of CR is as likely to be
wrong as right.

    lucy.fnord.net - learn it, love it. Now that it has the searchable item
database it's beginning to rival Allakhazam's, although Allakhazam's still
has more complete info on the items they do have and has better comparative
info.
