With your original charm song you can charm mobs up to and including
level 37.  This is oddly enough the highest level of hill giants,
which is probably a good indication of who is the true king of Rathe
Mtns soloing.  Your upgraded charm song at leve 39 will charm mobs up
to level 51, as long as they're not higher level than you.  This one
burns mana though, and bard mana regen is so slow as to be almost
non-existant.
Speaking of charming though, a bard who I have been friendly with
since I helped her on a Lambent quest when she was 20 did something
last night that amazed me.  I showed her several bard tricks,
including charm-fighting, and she often asks my advice on songs and
tactics.  She went to CS for the first time and was asking me in /tell
what to hunt.  I explained how the wyvern could be charm-kited or
chant-kited, and how the othmir can help if you get in trouble.  Her
first pull resulted in a mob just disappearing, off track, off target,
everything.  Her second pull resulted in 5 wyverns on her, and then
the first one came back.  She somehow killed and got exp for all 6,
over a blue of exp at 51 in about 10 minutes.  She admitted she was
lucky with the timing, but I still told her to lord it over all those
wimpy druids and their quad-kiting.  Bard sextuple-kiting rules.  (For
the record my best single pull is 7 spectres when they were still
blue, but I only got exp on 4 of the 7.)
She also shamed me into doing the Maligar portion of my epic solo, and
I'm glad since he's an absolute gimp, can't believe people say bring a
group, maybe if you're level 40.

they grow up so fast
