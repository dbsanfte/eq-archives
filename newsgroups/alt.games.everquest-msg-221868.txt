Actualy if you click on the default WHITE on the color palet ( 240, 240,
240 ) I believe it will remove any tint that wa on before.  THis costs one
prismatic dye ber slot, so if all you wanted to do was change your collor
dont waist a dye on changing it to default then spend another on the new
color.  IF you want to actualy tint something white you need to morve one or
all of the sliders all the way to 255.  I have a charcter that is tinted
white.  Everything was awsone when I first tinted him, but after making some
equipment changes most of his areas look like wased out grey or blue.  WHite
is one of the toughest tints to get to look good.
