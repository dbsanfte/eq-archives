I was being a smart ass, but, Rumbledoor was correct about the reasons 
behind it.

Off hand I don't recall if druids get either skill at any level.  If they 
do not get the skills, then you just have to find out which race gets the 
highest racial hide skill.  I suspect that halflings are the only ones to 
get both skills at 50, but, having both is largely only useful to a rogue 
who can use both skills simultaneously in order to move invisible to both 
undead and live mobs.  Racial hide will never go up for anyone unless they 
choose a class that also gets the skill.  Sneak can be extremely handy 
under certain circumstances, but, a skill cap of 50 on it does reduce it's 
utility.
