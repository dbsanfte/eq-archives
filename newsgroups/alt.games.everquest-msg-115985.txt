I think thats bad advice.

Well not bad (its obviously a good idea), but bad if its not what the raid
leader plans.

But.. I have been on many small guild PoF raids, where the idea was to get
to the Safe spot, and camp (especially clerics)
That means if you get agro.. keep running, till you reach the SS.  Melees
engage mobs until a cleric/several clerics are camped - then they try and
camp.

You might think that sucks for melees.. but think of it this way, if no
clerics get out... your raid is screwed.

Im guessing your a lower level guild (hence first PoF raid), lower level =
GUARANTEED agro at the safe spot

Listen to your raid leader... if he says run to the north wall and camp,
thats what you do - sometimes camping isnt an option.. 1 tip is to cast DA,
and /q out (stood not sitting)   Make sure your tanks are aware they need to
get a cleric out.

If the leader does say what m0oni suggested (I've been on a lot of PoF raids
that tried both methods) try to get to the SS as fast as possible. Look at a
map first hand, run around mobs, don't go anywhere near buildings (they have
a lot of mobs inside, and huge agro radius).    If you agro, instantly stop
and die.  If your near the SS, try and back up a few steps.

Some mobs see invis.. a handy trick, immediatly after you zone in, clear
your target window and start running.  If any mob name appears in your
target window, then it saw through your invis, and you have agro (a way of
telling before it actually hits you)

If you get 'warped' (random teleported) by a spider, do not run back to your
raid.  If you have to stand and die, then do so.. its better 1 person dies
and a monk pulls you, then you train an extra 1-20 mobs on the raid.

Another way of breaking PoF, when you zone in, turn 90 degrees left and run
to the zone wall (usual place for an AoE break) - the trick here is to get
your chanters casting AE stuns and everybody else casting PB ae's (point
blank ae's) asap, as soon as the mobs are in a nice tight bundle.

Obviously if your not caster heavy, this isn't really an option.

The other place for breaking in, is the bunker, its further left down the
wall I just mentioned (in the corner)... its a relatively safe spot., but if
you wipe out - you can NOT rez in the last 2 spots (there are mobs that
wander near both of these)

Drum it into people that upon porting in, never ever ever turn right and
run..

PoF is a great zone (imo) but a lot of people really hate it...  if you wipe
upon the break, you have a very tough C.R ahead of you.

Should the worst happen, don't keep running in and in till everybody has
multiple corpses (for one, the crippling lag it will create).. and don't be
afraid to ask for help.   It can take a while to break PoF - so don't leave
it till you have 30 mins left on corpses before asking a bigger guild for
help.

Have fun, and good luck.
