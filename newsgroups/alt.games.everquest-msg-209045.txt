I have a "theory" about this, but before I say it, let me start with
this...there have been many parses of how different stats effect
performance.  The best place to go is often the Shaman Class boards,
becuase who is more obssessed with stats than the people who have to spend
mana because others want stats increased?  And from what I understand, AGI
has been proven to provide only a marginal improvement in defensive
abilities, much the same way that DEX has a marginal increase in proc
rate.  So marginal that it isn't worth the plat to raise it, or the mana
to cast a buff spell.  (Unless you are working on skill ups...nothing is
too much to help raise skills, imho.)

That being said, based on how the mitigation AA does almost diddly-squat
for Rangers, whilst the avoidance AA does quite a bit, I almost wonder if
maybe AGI is at least intended to be the route for rangers to best improve
their damage-taking abilities.  Maybe AGI means more for chain classes
than for plate classes.  

Nonetheless, parses are parses, and I'm inclined to trust a good parse any
day over someone telling me that they have a "feeling" that they take less
damage when they have high agility.

If you want to truly continue the argument with your friend, do some
searches at forums.interealms.com/shaman/ or forums.interealms.com/ranger/
or perhaps the monk or warrior forums.  www.mobhunter.com is a good place
to get all the class-based forums.  A search will usually pull up a link
or two to the parse studies.  (I'd look it up myself, but firewall at work
is blocking me.)

I would argue both, of course, but I know that I intend to get Natural
Durability first.  Combat agility does diddly squat to help against nukes,
for example, whereas extra HP are always useful.  I do hear from Rangers
Glade (there is a great FAQ on the AAs there btw) that Combat Agility is
still really really nice, and even spiffier when you get Lightening
Reflexes as well.
