Did my first adventure last night in LDoN.

Good group motoring along then things went bad on us, warr went LD and
froze out (guildmate and he had been having some problems earlier anyway).
Two deaths happened as we tried to carry on. GOt everyone back into zone
and suddenly one player decides we cant finish, just says he's off hammers
a /q and disappears (our cleric) so we can;t even manage the lesser reward
(which would have been easy). Not only that the toon was the ML....so they
sure are gonna get chased up next time I see them.

A) Is this attitude of 'Im not going to complete so I'll leave' a common
one - I mean does dropping out there record you no fail result or
something that makes it attractive to do.
B) It was a mass kill for 25 claws collection in Mistmoore Catacombs. It
was entertaining and certainly reasonable xp at getting me one orange bub
before the death incident. THe group described it as basic - so are the
other options more complicated? More fun? More themed?
