you are hated almost everywhere you go
travel is often difficult for the above reason
you cannot dual wield weapons
you cannot bind outside of cities
nobody has any idea how to use you in a group

now the cons....hehe, j/k

after playing many races and classes, i'm proud to have an sk as my main

I can solo quite efficiently and in groups without a monk I am always called
upon to pull. As a puller for the group you carry alot of responsibility and
have to make quick decisions. You have some of the best defenses in the game
and get feign death at 30. <taunt> You are essentially a warrior with a
brain. </taunt>

You could taunt mobs off casters better than any melee class in the game, in
turn you will take alot of damage. When druid snares fail, you have
darkness...... and fear.

The best reason? You and the mob have been in a long drawn out fight and its
neck and neck down to the wire...... you Harm Touch the mob for (10xLevel+1)
damage. Its a sight to behold  :)

Get used to dying alot, but having a helluva lot of fun at the same time.
