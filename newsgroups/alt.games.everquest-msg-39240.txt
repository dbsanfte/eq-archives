>was kinda fun, GM passed out wedding cake and booze

It confused me at first, seeing Valtron's finest brew on other servers
than EMarr (Seen it before the wedding, mind you - Valtron used to be
our GM, you see) :) Jumping off the pier was fun too, I might have to
do that with my main to get her swimming up...

And yeah, it was a lovely wedding :) They made a handsome troll and
wife couple :)

>dafoo - 5th monk, worshipper of veeshan (very tempted to come play this toon
>more)

Damn, your pet monk is higher than mine! (I, who can't think of good
last names for my alts on EMarr, have the perfect last name for that
monk girl. She might get played too, monks are fun even with no gear)
