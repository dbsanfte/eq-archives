This is where I had a chuckle.  For a long time there have been 7
strange dark fungus and 10 underfoot mushrooms, which meant 3 were
left to rot when farming for kaladim constitutional.  One got changed
and there was another spawn that was inadverantly planted inside the
wall.

A bug that went unfixed for 7 years...  Anyway tradeskiller now gets 9
matching pairs with no rot or extras.
