Oh, and just fyi;

Clarity: Increase Mana by 4 (L29) to 7 (L48) per tick
C2: Increase Mana by 11 per tick
KEI: Increase Mana by 14 per tick

The difference is the stat boost KEI provides, which gives one a larger mana
pool.  And if you drain that large mana pool dry, the extra 3 regen per tick
isn't going to help you much if downtime is your issue.
