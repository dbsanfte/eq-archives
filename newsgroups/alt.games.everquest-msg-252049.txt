Having not reached that level, I can't comment on that yet, probably 
never will due to the amount of playtime I put into my warrior.

Same for me really, I've played my warrior maybe two times since the 
changes, but did notice how dramatic the difference was.

Yes, actually.  :b

Has a whole lot to do with how often I play any twinks at all.  I keep 
forgetting to correct the sig, but, the only twink I have played much 
recently is my druid, got him to 29 to imbue emeralds for me.  My warrior 
has been soloing in CC near the town, and solos the blue mobs there quite 
easilly.  Prior to that, he soloed in Frontier Mountains, and Runnyeye.  
I played him quite a bit leveling up to the mid 20s, since then, if I 
play him more than once a month or so, that is a lot.
