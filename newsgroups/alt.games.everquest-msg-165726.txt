Guys, that guild will not make you a whole lot of plat as fast as
working for it. Who wants to sit around making pickles?

You will find people have all kinds of "witchcraft" in this game. They
think they have a cheat, and usually it depends on some marginal gain.

My comment wasn't that this guild wasn't available for free, the first
is free(because it is bloodly useless), the second I have seen as a
copyrighted document.

All guides are not worth any more money than free. This is an
unqualified truth. Nothing in any guide is going to make you more
money than something that someone on some website hasn't already
posted for free.

The way you make money on guides is by selling them to gullible
preteens who are looking for the get rich scheme.

It is the same thing with carnival/midway food wagons, the ones that
sell elephant ears and funnel cakes. The way you get rich on them is
by selling one to an idiot who doesn't know what he is getting into.
