One really ought to turn it on for the first few levels. 20% at level 1 
means you'll have 2 or 3 lxp points by level 10, and it you'll have had 
to kill like 4 extra spiderlings... seriously its not a big drag.

At higher levels it is a noticeable drag, but then after you have key 
AAs whats the rush for another +2 cha...


And several the lxp's are useful:

Find path to PC. - great for ldon idiots who get lost at the drop of a 
hat

Regen hp - whats not to like about a couple more +hp regen
+hp - whats not to like about another few dozen hitpoints. We'd all be 
pretty stoked at finding an item that was an upgrade to something we had 
by adding another 30 hp to you, and everyone in the group... why whine 
about one that does that without using up an item slot?

inspect buffs - great for ldon idiots who don't respond to questions 
about whether haste is still up

health of targets target - great way to tell who the mob is currently 
beating on without trying to sort out the battle spam, also good way to 
see if taunt worked, again without reading through the spam. Also a nice 
tool for cc, and healing classes.

delegate MA - great tool to assist cc classes. Visual confirmation which 
mob the MA is targeted on.

delegate & mark npc - another tool to assist cc classes... also a great 
tool for chanters to identify their pet and make it stand out in a crowd 
of 'a raging beasts'

+atk ... hey its plus atk... whats not to like.

Seriously... the LXP's aren't great. But they aren't that bad. I've 
racked up some 50 or so points worth on my 51 sk (and thereby kept him 
on par level-wise with the Iksar I regularly group with), and we really 
miss all the utility when the sk isn't the leader.
