Nope.

Haste is exactly what it say - Haste. The common misconception is that
it's a reduction in delay. It's not. It's an increase in speed of
attack. No difference in theory, you still hit faster, but greatly
different in calculation. The numbers show the common flaw in his
method.

*** 16% haste ***

Delay without haste means you're hitting at 100% speed.
Add 16% haste, and you're now hitting at 116% unhasted speed.
On a 9/22 weapon, that means 116% of 22 which means it's a 9/18.97
weapon. (22/1.16)

In the above example, you took the haste value away from 100%, and
applied that to the delay: 100-16=84, 84% of 22 delay is 18.48. This is
wrong.


For a more obvious example, take an extreme.

*** 100% Haste on 10/20 weapon ***

Correct method:  20 delay hitting at 200% (100% + haste%) speed 
= 10 delay (20/2.00)

Incorrect method: 20 delay minus 100% (haste%) delay
= 0 delay (100% of 20 = 20)
