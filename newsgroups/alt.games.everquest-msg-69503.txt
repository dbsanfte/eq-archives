    It's a level 49 spell, so you're likely looking at 200 Conj. to stop
chain-fizzling. Go to EC, start auctioning all that junk you've been letting
clog your bank account, and while you auction cast Halo until OOM. Med to
full, repeat. If you're a typical wizard (INT 200+), it'll go up pretty
fast. And your bank account will have lots of cash and lots of space again!
