Yes, that's a pretty discouraging paragraph, but I have to wonder both why
there's no direct quote to that nature, as there had been for every other
example mentioned in the article, and why that particular example is so
incongruous with the rest of the article.  Nothing else mentioned in that
article is remotely like this.

Plus, there's the initial paragraph mentioning Everquest and Asheron's Call,
but many people are breezing right over that and didn't appear to notice
that they mentioned those two games to show that they *weren't* the type of
games they were talking about.  While they're making money off both those
titles through monthly fees, the number of people who have actually
purchased those games are decidedly paltry compared to the number of people
who have purchased commercially successful games that aren't MMOGs.  If they
can continue to milk the cash cow of games that have sold millions of copies
in a similar fashion through addons and such, that's a real market for
expansion.

Again, not quoted, although it seems as if a very simple direct quote was
provided by Andrew House.  The only thing he's actually got the guy saying
is that Sony has noticed that people will pay money for "online,
downloadable content" (ignoring the fact that EBay and IGE transactions
*aren't* downloadable content).  I'm wondering why, in an article that was
rife with quotations, to support a completely different subject, quotes
suddenly became unavailable for this one particular, incongruent instance.

I'm not sure that matters, and I'm certainly not picking nits with
semantics.  The rest of the article dealt with something completely
different from EBay and IGE transactions, and I think many people are
glossing over that fairly important point.  I never even brought up the
console versus PC argument.

> I, for one, am not so naive.

Hey, if they start an IGE-like operation on their console versions of EQ, I
won't have any difficulty saying that they're priming to move it to the PC
version, but we'll see what happens, really.  How well is the console
version doing?  Would they need to resort to more desperate measures to keep
that property afloat?
