I'll have to preface this answer by saying, pretty much "no". Soloing at
42 is usually impossible, and when not, highly impractical, slow, and a
huge PITA. It *can* be done, obviously, but your'e not twinked well
enough to make it any type of picnic. You're time will likely still be
better invested actively travelling and LFG.

That said, there may be one or two possibilities. I'm trying to remember
what level the tree spec in Free Rot is and what level he greens out at.
Specs are nice targets once they are low blue, because they have a
relatively tiny amount of HP for their level, they are slow as hell even
when uninjured, and they rely heavily on their DD casting. You can use
your natural Barb slam ability to interrupt as many casts as possible,
and I *think* it's on a six minute timer in a totally green area so you
should have plenty of time to bandage and heal up between fights. Even
if you have to run, you'll have a fair chance of outrunning it to the RM
zone. They even drop a little bit of fair loot which you can sell over
the line in RM at the merchants when you want a break.

Of course, good luck *getting* the camp in the first place. It's a
favorite of solo Necros, Druids, and Mages. As I said, check mob level
first, though. I honestly don't remember which level that mob is ideal
for.
