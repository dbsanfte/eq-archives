The graphics in EQ is the main area where the game lags behind current
technology. If the screen shots are any indication, the expansion
coming at the end of this year will go a long way towards correcting
that, for the new lands, anyway.

It depends what you're looking for. I played Diablo 2, and I enjoyed
it, but I was done with it in a month.

I've been playing EQ for over two years, and am not yet done, by a
long shot. There is no 'endgame' in EQ - it has no ultimate
destination or goal. The point of the game, instead, is the journey.
Give it some time, and you'll understand what I mean.

>Maybe the total playable land space you can go around in is better

Not 'better'. 'BETTER'. Emphasis.

I find them a lot better than Diablo's were. To each their own.

Best way to do that is to play through the tutorial, then experiment
in-game.
