A few epics have parts there, a shaman spell has a part there,
and it's a GREAT place for a necro/paly/cleric to solo around 45
to 52 or so (and a rogue with some twink gear to solo from 51
through 54...after 54, some start to green...although for a solo
rogue even light blues show visible exp gain).
