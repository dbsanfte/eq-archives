Actually, I'm of the opinion it's the custom UI's that cause the problem,
loading them to be more precise.  

I've been working on my own modifications recently, and after each
/loadskin command the change is noticeably slower.  After about 10
/loadskin commands I get a virtual memory warning.  If I keep going
after that EQ will eventually lock and crash on a /loadskin command.

I had my kitty running straight for 3 days this week (playing and
selling) on my Win98 machine with no issues.  I don't keep a character
in game that long on my XP Pro box, because I don't want all those
resources being used when I'm programming - but it is the one where I
had the problems with virtual memory after multiple /loadskin's.

At a guess, the code that loads a custom UI has memory leak, and switching
characters with custom UI's probably executes that code each time.  That
(IMO) would explain Cel's experiences.
