What I don't get is how you think that little X2 scenario there is
even REMOTELY comparable to the situation here. A more valid
comparison: The bonus disc is included with all purchases of the
movie, then they decide to give away a few more to people who DIDN'T
buy the movie via a draw.

You're getting something extra for free by purchasing a product.
However, if you don't want to purchase the product, you still have a
chance to get it anyway. Where's the problem?

How is this any different from any other "free with purchase" promo?
It's not.
