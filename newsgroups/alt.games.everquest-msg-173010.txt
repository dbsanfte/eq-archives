 I've had odd Doom dreams before. Imagine noclipping outside
of the level in your dream and finding yourself standing on
tiny bits of floor stretching from the rooms and areas all around
your position. Its happened to me on a couple occasions.

 Iif you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine 
standing in the middle of a spoked wheel where the 
surrounding rooms make up the rim, the floors make up
the spokes, but without gaps between them, and instead
of standing on a hub, you are standing right where all of
the floors are comming together around you .The floors appear
to be a triangle, with the wall of the room at the base, and you
at the apex, This is actualy how the Doom engine (and several other
games using the same kind of engine) works, scince the floor/ceiling
and related information render from the walls to your position 
in the level to make it look like you are standing on a solid floor.
