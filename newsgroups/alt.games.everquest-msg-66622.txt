Rarely are PC games updated, patched and added to on so regular a basis as
EQ.  Even with a team of a couple of hundred beta testers working 8 hours a
day, 5 days a week (give them the weekend off to play the game on their
own), they wouldn't be able to test every possible combination of hardware
and software.  We're not talking about console games here.  It's not like EQ
was written for one video card/sound card/processor/memory configuration the
way Super Mario Bros. was.  On the contrary, it was written to run on top of
a multimedia system that tries to support as many, different and
incompatible, pieces of hardware as possible.  If you've ever tried putting
a different engin into a car, you'd know that sometimes you have to replace
the transmission and/or beef up the suspension to handle it.  Is it Ford's
fault that an Escort won't support a Ferrari V8 out of the box?  Same
situation.
