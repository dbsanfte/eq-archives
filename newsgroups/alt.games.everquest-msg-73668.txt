A long time ago conventional "wisdom" <read: The Vision>
deemed that casters died a lot more than melee characters, and
so needed to be able to bind anywhere.

This must have apparantly been before they decided to add
SoW and Gate/Evac spells, as well as Snare/Root/Mez/Memblur
etc.  Usually, deep in a dungeon if something saw through my
rogue's sneak/hide the first thing I would do was AoE stun, then
Root, then cast a quick Gate right to the other side of the Upper
Guk zone before re-zoning and trying again.

Oh, wait...no he didn't.  He just died.
