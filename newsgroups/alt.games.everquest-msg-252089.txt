Saryrn server seems to be stagnant in lvl65 population, and shrinking at
lower levels. This is based on the past few weeks of seeking groups with my
65 BST, 47 CLR, 28 PAL and my son's 24 ECH. In particular, filling out a
full group for anything in the 20s (including LDONs) has gotten damn near
impossible.
