While for 53 levels, I had to make do with such pets as the
warrior, paladin, and shadowknight, at 54 I finally got one
I don't have to split loot with, the Unswerving Hammer of
Faith.

I honestly think I'm the only cleric I've ever seen cast the
pesky little critter, he's generally inefficient and/or useless...
but I'm terribly fond of him.

More than once I've mentioned him to another high level
cleric to find them surprised, they'd assumed the spell was
simply another in our long line of completely lame weapon
summons (OK, clue, clerics pretty much don't -use- weapons,
so summoning ones that are no-drop, with lousy stats for
the level, means a waste of an entire spell line!)
