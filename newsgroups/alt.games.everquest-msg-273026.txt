HAHAHAHA

Keep dreaming. 

You only get access to them if you are a station access member -when- 
the pack is released, and even then only if you were a member for 60 
days prior as well.

So.. if you are an account in good standing (ie up and running for 60 
days, you will be given the adventure pack). Any adventure packs that 
you got will remain yours when you downgrade. And upgrading will only 
get you adventurepacks that come out once you've been a member for 60 
days. (So if an adventure pack came out last week, comes out next 
months, and comes out 3 months hence, and you upgrade your account 
today... you will only get the 3 months hence one. You will still have 
to pay for the old one, and the one comming out next month.

Its not as complicated as it sounds, and it is 'fair'. (At least as fair 
as SOE ever is, that is.)
