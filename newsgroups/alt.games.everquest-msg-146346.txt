The slanted poles at the end of each row of awnings are climbable,
no GFlux needed, even a Warrior (i.e. my trader mule) can do it.
Not only that, but once you're up there you can eventually locate
and click on the hidden joker with the 80pp vendor trash priced at
1pp, lol.

I am glad that the 80 item fix has eliminated the chumps trying to
drive prices down by putting items up for sale at bargain prices,
but having the items be unreachable (i.e. not really for sale).
In fact, I have not seen the two I noticed trying this most often
on Tunare server since the patch.
