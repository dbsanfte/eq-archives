    That's a higher-level version of something my Iksar Monk was greeted
with the first time he went to Kurn's Tower to go get pieces in the basement
for his quest shackle. Someone had obviously done something wrong, and was
running to get out, but ran into the middle of a group of SK badgers. As I
crossed the main floor to the stairs down, I saw "<Soandso> writhes in the
grip of agony" flash across the screen quickly four times, followed quickly
by "<Soandso> has been slain by a Burynai Excavator!" Made me tread a BIT
more cautiously. ;-)
