Well...if you don't know where it is, then you can't. :) But generally if
you go to the zone that is indicated in the description and look at the
overhead map, any inn's will be marked by the inn icon.  Then once you get
to the inn, look for the doors that glow when your mouse moves over them.
The slightly confusing thing is that there are multiple doors, and you
need to find the right one for *that* player.  I suppose they were trying
to make the instanced rooms feel a little less instanced.
