I haven't seen any posts dedicated to this subject here at a.g.e., so in
case it isn't already common knowledge, I wanted to pass on that there is
evidence of "anti-camp" code. Or rather, anti...well,
anti-grind-in-one-spot code.

I read about it first on the official boards and decided to start paying
attention to my own xp gain. The past 2-3 days I've been "grinding" near
the docks in Enchanted Lands. Partly because we like the specific spot,
and partly because we wanted to see this code for ourselves, we've been
primarily on the klaknok soldiers (^^ group mobs).

What we've consistently seen is that at the beginning of the session, both
the 31 and 32 beetles give us 1.5% per kill. After about 5-6 of these, it
drops to 1.25%.  Then after a while 1%, and finally will bottom out at
about .5% per kill.  Generally we stop hunting at that point.

When we return the next day, it is back to 1.5% and the same process
repeats itself.  We've done this 4 times now, so I'm fairly confident it
isn't a fluke.

I do not know if SOE has stated that this exists officially, but I'm
personally very convinced, and so are many others.  (If you don't want to
take my word for it I encourage you to do your own experiments or search
on the official message boards for threads discussing this.)

Point is, if you weren't aware of it already, keep it in mind when seeking
XP. :)  Don't assume that you can hunt in the same one spot over and over.
You will in fact get much better xp if you move on after a bit.

I don't know if the code is by geography, spawn point, or creature type,
nor how long it takes to reset, but I do know that staying in spot too
long is deadly to fast xp!
