There was no benefit:  An equally  more honest system scan could be 
obtained, as some others have pointed out, with a non-ActiveX method, ie, 
having us download an executable that we can virus scan to our heart's 
content before running.

It's funny that you think I'm going apeshit here.  My aversion to ActiveX 
is probably just about as strong as your aversion to the word "toon".  
What was it you just said about how if something annoys you, you oughta be 
saying so?  But hey, I agree with you about "toon".  We'll just have to 
agree to disagree on this one, I figure.
