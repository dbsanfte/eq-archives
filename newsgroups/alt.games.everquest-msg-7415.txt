Perhaps I'm projecting here, but if the only spells you cast are
heals and buffs, as so many of our EQ compatriots will insist
is proper, then you are doing it wrong.  Yes, if you constantly
die and make naked corpse runs you are also doing it wrong.

Even if it works, though, the buff heal cycle is inherantly boring;
as you are in the game for fun and excitement, this approach
is contradictory.  There are mobs which can be handled most
efficiently with this approach, of course... try going after some
of the other sorts of mobs.  Don't pick on any one type of
mob; stun stun stun heal stun stun stun heal med is no less
inherantly boring than the heal cycle... but if you vary your
prey and your approach to them, you won't have to spend
your EQ life in a rut.  LGuk is an excellent example; some
mobs are best tanked, others need root control, others
simply beg for chain stun, still others (or other group composition)
call for the cleric to Nuke.  If a cleric bores you in this dungeon,
then I can't think of a class that wouldn't.

Well sort of, but no.  Pulling can take on a wide variety of
complications and complextions, as can killing.  Assuming you
are looting a variety of prey, even this can be exciting.

Rather, I mean "pull the caimen, stand toe to toe hitting
my combat keys till it falls, loot and destroy the junk, wait
till I heal, repeat till I level, consider the Crocodile.  Eventually
I'll ding again and again, until I'm considering the DW Caimen,
then the DW Crocodile."

Exact same set of actions, only on increasingly difficult prey
as you level up.  No matter how you handle the crocs in
oasis, you can get trapped into the boredom cycle fairly
easily.

It certainly sounds like you have... but time in grade is no
indicator of playing the class well, or more to the point of
this discussion, "right."

You find the class boring and repetitive.  Since there is a wide
variety of things you can do and do well with the class, in fact
as wide a variety as any of the other classes in the game, you
must therefore be doing it "wrong."  Not necessarily ineptly,
mind you, I can certainly think of a lineup of foes that would
take you -quite- efficiently from 6 to 49 without ever having
cast anything but heals and buffs, as long as you insist on a
classically well put together group at all times.  Just in such
a way as to make playing the class an exercise in tedium.

Which ones weren't "boring" and how did you approach
their lives?  Did you keep doing the same sorts of combats
in the same sorts of situations, only taking on higher level
prey as you became higher level?  Or were you forced to
find a wide variety of solutions to changing conditions,
prey vulnerabilities, and party composition?

Personally, I think you could make any class boring if
you made the effort, with the possible exception of
the bard you eschew... bards more than the other
classes simply can't be effective doing the same thing
they did at lower levels; they go from tank to cleric
to enchanter to shaman instead of getting better and
better at any given field.  You could only make an
ineffective bard boring, a good one -has- to evolve.
