If it is at all an option for you, backup your entire EQ directory.  Format,
install windows, install EQ, copy your backup of EQ back over the EQ
install, play, all updates already downloaded, all hotkeys, options
unchanged.  I've done it twice now with great success.  I'm told that you
can skip the install EQ step, haven't tried it that way.
