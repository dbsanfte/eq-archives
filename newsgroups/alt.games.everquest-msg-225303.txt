EQ planning didn't put enough thought into this change...

The stone from SG to Jaggedpine is a high traffic area for lowbee
players that need bank access. Surfall Glade to Jaggedpine is much
easier than the run to South Qeynos. The change caught quite a few
players off guard; while visiting the new area I found two groups of
low players that were trying to find their way out of Jaggedpine...
needless to say my 40 ranger had to guide a very timid lot out of
Jaggedpine.(I felt like a camp counselor with all my kids following me
to zone lol)
