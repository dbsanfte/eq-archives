No, it's a directed analogy.  I believe you probably want to check out this
website:

http://www.m-w.com

Has a lot of good definitions for those big words.

I can guarantee that my cat will never get the chance to reproduce without
ever being neutered.  Perhaps I just set the bar of my responsibility a bit
higher?

Though I am beginning to see your point.  Laziness.  "I can't be bothered to
be *that* responsible."

Yes, you've changed my opinion.  I am now in favor of fixing stupid people.

Overpopulation?  You've heard that mice are an endangered species because
there are too many cats?

Again, http://www.m-w.com will serve you well in looking up the definition
of overpopulation.  What you meant to say was that there was an inconvenient
amount of semi-wild cats and dogs that people didn't want to have to look at
and would rather have killed.

And "humane" is subjective.  Perhaps you should try reading some on
euthanasia for the elderly.  Very humane.  In fact, since there's an
"overpopulation" of old people, offing them "humanely" is much better
than just letting them get older and drain their relatives, Medicare, etc. 
Just being a responsible son...

I'm a helluva lot more worried about their kids.  /sticksouttongue
