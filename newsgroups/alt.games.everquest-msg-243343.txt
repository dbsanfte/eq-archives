Hi all,

Just need some clarification on skills for low/mid level characters.

Will a given skill (say 1H blunt) continue to rise, as long as it is being
used regularly by the character, untill further advancement requires payment
for training?

Once payment is required for training/skill points is this the only way to
increase a skill, or if it is used enough will it continue to rise in the
absence of spending training points/money?

The reason I ask is that I noticed that for my newbie character's early
levels I often received the 'you have become better at 1H-blunt' message in
the middle of battle, but as I am increasing in level this is not happening.
Therefore, is it better to save up training points at early levels to spend
later since my character would increase in those skills, with use, anyway?

Thanks,

Andrew
