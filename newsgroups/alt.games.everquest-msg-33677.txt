As a cleric, I watch that spam fly by not to see what the
melee-types are dishing out, but for the damage the mob
is doing per round.   Since the first thing I do in a group
after buffing is ask the tanks how many HPs they have, it's
nice to know that those 68 HP/round a_generic_mob00 is
dishing out means I have XX seconds to cast as heal when
the tank gets to two bulbs on my mana bar.

As a warrior, I watch it for the occasional "mine is bigger
than yours" crit, of course, along with the "stupid cleric
hasn't thrown a heal yet which means I'm going to die so
I better run" calculations.   It wouldn't be much fun having
a major crit that doesn't show to that monk to make up
for the "look how fast I generate damage" chat.  <g>
