    Well, I should have been a lot more positive in response to your earlier
post regarding experience - it did contain exactly the kind of information
we probably want more of around here and I was rather dismissive of it,
without a doubt because it was in dissagreement and supplied as a
counterpoint to part of one of my arguments. Once again it does reflect I
think rather poorly on me that I didn't do more with your post than supply a
tardy rebuttal. That aside, what I needed to say, and what I wish I'd said
was:

    I was absolutely dead wrong when I said that a level 40 character and a
level 50 character duoing will advance at basically the same rate on their
exp-ometers.

    Your figures establish that this statement was off by a wide margin, and
I regret not being more respectful of your efforts and intellect, being that
your post was far more the kind of information I like to read than many of
the flames and silly retorts I've had from this newgroup in the past.

    However, that one statement was not central to the argument that soloing
is generally better experience than grouping, and I think overturning it
doesn't necessarily trash the point that at the levels where its likely to
occur, a lower level person grouping with a higher level person will find
the experience slow compared to soloing. The higher level person is still
absorbing the bulk of the experience, and while their comparitive rate of
advancement will not be identical, the lower person's rate will be closer to
the higher person's than soloing would be, and probably even grouping
without such higher characters. In order for your calculations to have true
bearing on these statements, you obviously need to add in the number of mobs
dropped over time [pull time and possible downtime not just added dps needs
to be thought of], in addition to the per-mob experience factors.

    I think the basic reason that soloing is generally better experience is
that the kill rate of a 6 person group doesn't add up to the kill rate of
six soloers - and it falls short to the point where the group experience
bonusi don't make up the difference. Although with buff sharing and
cross-skill tactics one might expect grouping to be more effective, a closer
examination shows that the various abilities of the classes don't fit
together as well as they should. Necromancers and druids do much of their
solo damage with dots. For a typical group that consists of a few meleers
and chain-single-pulls, dots dont get a chance to work their efficiency.
Even a wizard with faster hitting damage has more trouble killing
mana-efficiently in a group than solo - if he nukes early he gains agro and
gets yelled at by the tank/cleric - and if he nukes late he often kills the
mob outright with some of the damage and the rest is wasted. Many groups
even encourage this because its convenient not to have to run after mobs.
Just some more things I thought of...

Cheers,
James
