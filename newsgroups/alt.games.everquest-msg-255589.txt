In some camera views, you can use Alt-arrows to shift the camera.
Alt-left/right "rotates" the view, circling it around the character
(who stays at the center of the view), and Alt-up/down moves the
camera away/toward the ground, i.e. looking more down toward the
character vs looking across the ground.

Though I usually use first person, I do have a hotkey tied to a 3rd
person view (using "User defined camera" in the Camera Keyboard
options), and use it particularly when pulling.  Indeed, I have a
question for you: how do YOU "pause and glance back to see what's
coming"?  Any time I try to do that, I get whacked, especially if
I'm not SOWed or am pulling in a cramped area so I can't run fast.
I much prefer using a 3rd person view -- I'm getting better at
navigating with it so I can keep running while circling the camera
to see what's coming up behind me.
