Hmm, that may be an answer.  It's almost tragic how difficult it is to
actually find something to learn from, given the great number of texts out
there.

Also, no way to tell if you're right or not.  It's amazing how often
compensating errors can give you a "Right Answer, Wrong Reason" situation.
I still need something to check my work against.

Why does that remind me of "I've got a really good proof for this, but it
won't fit in the margin."?

The athelitcs one.  I never saw the point of paying for classes, when you're
just there to get a credit towards a piece of paper.  I'm happy to see
colleges starting to court the older types who are returning to academia
from the work force.  In fact, I'd like to see more college students have
real-life experience under their belt before heading off to the ivory towers
of the Ivy league.

Well... "and the stupid shall be punished."
