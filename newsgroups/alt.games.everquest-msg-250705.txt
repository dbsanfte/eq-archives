Yes it can.  But everyone needs to know their character, and be willing to
actually *play* and not be busy watching TV or 2boxing or whatever the HELL
people do when they join a group and then appear to be AFK.  We did a 5 person
caster group when our tank went LD that turned out just fine - necro pet was
our tank.  But we were all experienced at LDON and we all were *good*
players...
