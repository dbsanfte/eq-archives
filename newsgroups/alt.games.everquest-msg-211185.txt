As long as you have the expansion registered to your account, it should 
have downloaded automatically.  Make sure next time you patch that you 
click advanced then make sure LoY is checked off on the downloads, check 
  the other options you have too.  I check my patcher periodically 
because sometimes it gets changed, like today when I just checked.  Also 
make sure you have Optional zones checked so you'll have Stonebrunt, you 
need Stonebrunt to get to the zones that were added with LoY.

Good luck.
