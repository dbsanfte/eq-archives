Your putting words in my mouth.


My comments about it being a park, refer to the fact that the area can 
be alive and healthy afterwards. If a lynx or cougar wants to make its 
home there great (I don't think many lions are loose in North America).

I favor hydro over most other types of energy. I'm willing to pay the 
price in terms of destroying an ecosystem or 3 to get sustainable long 
term clean power.

And i consider it an environmentally sound position.
