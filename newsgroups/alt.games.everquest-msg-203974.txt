Usually I dont auction. I have 0 competition, so people just send me tells,
or shove money in my face (even when anon).
A guy last night shoved 10p in my face, and then wen I said it wasnt enough
he complained that I wasnt auctioning my minimum price in ooc. I wasnt
auctioning period. I was just sitting there. I had people I was talking to.
I guess im obliged to KEI every stranger who shoves 10p in my face.
AAAAAARGH
