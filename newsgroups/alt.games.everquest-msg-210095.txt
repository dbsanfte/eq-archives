[Cue "Kiss And Say Goodbye" by the Manhattans....]

Here I am, Level 15, Human, Warrior.  Picked up all my (cherry-red)
BattleMaster armor earlier in my career.  It seems fine but I'm wondering at
what point I need to replace it with something a bit sturdier.

I am not twinked and I don't want to be twinked.  I want to see this thing
through a non-twinked progression.  Call me crazy if you will but please
tell me: What's my next set of armor and when should I start obtaining it?

Thank you fair Questers of Ever.  Thank you very much.
