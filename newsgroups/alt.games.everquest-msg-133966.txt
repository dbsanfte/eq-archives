There are five specializations, matching the five spell caster
skill areas.  Oddly the trainer won't show you which is
which, but when you select one he will tell you which one
you are about to train in.  They are also in alphabetical
order IIRC (Been simply ages since I had to pick one)

You can specialize in all five (counter to logic) but only
one can pass the 50 skill mark.

Each time you cast a spell, you check your skill in its
specialization, on a success, you spend less mana casting
it.  Those specializations at 50 almost never seem to
succede, while the one you went over with really starts
to kick in fairly reliably over 100.   Up over the 200 line
in the high levels you come to count on it working most of
the time, which can mean a pretty significant savings in
mana casting that line.

Most druids  pick Evocation, although Alteration is another
possibility.  Ask yourself which spell line you cast the most,
and further which you will be casting the most as you
continue to level up.
