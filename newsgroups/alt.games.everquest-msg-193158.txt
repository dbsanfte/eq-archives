I never said SOE couldn't do it.  There's a difference between what
they *can* do and what they *ought* to do.  Simply because they call
the shots doesn't mean that whatever they choose to do is right.

I somehow doubt that if at your guild's next big raid, a GM
materializes and poofs the target you're going after that you would so
blithely accept that that action would be right and perfectly
acceptable because after all, you're in their world now.

You're missing the issue.  I initally said that it was wrong, but it
wasn't a big deal.  The fact that the damage is pretty limited doesn't
make it right, instead, it simply makes it no big deal.  Damage still
took place.  Someone, a player on an "open server", received a pretty
significant ingame reward for something done out of game.  That's also
how it differs from ridiculous rewards doled out in GM events, even.

And do you think that warrior will stay guildless forever?   Do you
think she has no associations with guilds?  Would it be wrong if you
discovered that she either recntly joined a guild or was a de facto
member of a guild (ie, she raids with one guild as regularly as most
of their tagged members)?  What suddenly makes it wrong in those
circumstances where it is not wrong now?

As for prestige, who the hell cares, really?  I was just pointing out
that you weren't considering any of the merits of either side of the
issue when you mentioned that the FoH member had no problem with it. 
Apparently if Furor condemns this development tomorrow, what you're
now describing as perfectly okay becomes a terrible injustice, despite
the fact that none of the issues involved changed at all.  That's not
particularly thoughtful, is it?

I was just making the point that "you won't know how you'll react
until you find yourself in that situation".  The latter is more
believable because they're following a more base instinct rather than
taking a self-aggrandizing posture.  The fact is though, it's still
speculation.
