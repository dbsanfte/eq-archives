This question pertains to Firiona Vie which apparently has its own Language
Rules (unkown by me!)

I had a strange thing happen last night and I hope someone can tell me what
the proglem might be. My Halfling Druid is at level 11 and his Human was
Bad. But, I mangaged to communicate enough to a Human to get him to
understand how we could trade language lessons. We zoned back and forth
between Rivervale and Misty Thicket giving each other lessons. I went from
Bad to Average and had dreams of Mastery - he was cranking along as well.
We hit a point where I did not get a skill point for a long time. Not
wanting him to loose interest, I gave the OK sign /cheer and we zoned.  He
was still getting skill points and I gave him the sign 5 times until I
called it quits. Darn, can I not get past Average at level 11 or what? Are
there level limits and if so where/how do I find out what they are?
