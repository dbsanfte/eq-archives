A few elements of curiosity...

How, or why, or how and why, did your guild get into such an odd position?

To be worried about PoFire keys, much less Sol Ro keys, seems bizarre when
discussing a Time guild.  There's a couple reasons for that.  First, Fennin
Ro is without a doubt and by far the easiest of the gods.  He gives out lots
of keys.  It's utterly simple to park armies of twinks there to take
advantage of that fact.  Obviously, and here may be where my logic is
failing, if you're at the level of the game where you're just now working on
P5 gods, you've done Fennin Ro recently and could again.

Next, "these all go to our most reliable and needed people" also throws my
logic for a loop.  Your most reliable and needed people were there when the
four gods dropped...   right?

Now, there is a possibility that some guild out there, perhaps yours, got
into Time entirely by piggy-backing.  Maybe that's where my logic fails in
trying to figure out the hows and whys of your description of your guild. 
But, well, that's irrelevant.  First, if you can take a P5 god, you can take
any of the big four to get into Time.  Hell, Fennin Ro and Coirnav are
pushovers compared to even the P4 fights.  And I hear that with the added
levels Rathe has gone from the hardest of the four to being fairly easy. 
Another five levels per tank in an off-tanking-intensive event make a world
of difference.  And second, your most reliable and needed people were there
when you got into Time however you got into Time, so either way they're
*still* already flagged according to logic.
