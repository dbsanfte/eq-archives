Easy : go to the Spec Island in OOT. Exactly 4 specs there. A great quad.
Not too many HP. One note : the island will also be populated by
gargoyles/giant skeletons. The gargoyles WILL aggro, even though they're
green to you. Clear the gargs, so only skeles are left. They will not aggro.
The island is safe. And usually, by the time you're back at FM, the 4 specs
will have popped again. Keywords : levitate, keep distance.
These babies should get you to 47 VERY fast.
As a bonus, you have the Oracle island right next to you. Kill him for the
Robe of the Oracle, which should still be worth a few PP here and there.
Sister Island is right next to you also, to sell the Scythes that drop off
the Specs.
AND if you're sporting a KEI, or something like that, and the specs re-pop
too slow, you can always run to the Cyclop island and snare/root/DoT a
Seafury Cyclops now and then.
Then I suggest you try the hornets in Burning Wood. Ash and Cinder hornets
should be great xp till 49/50. Then you can include Ember, Scoriae hornets
as well.

Happy hunting,

Lalor Windrider
