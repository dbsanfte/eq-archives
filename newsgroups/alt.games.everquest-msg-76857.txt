Then its amazing the powers of a placebo ;) I'm a wolfform freak and
I've got so used to it I complain my 21 druids sow is sooo slooooow...

....and I thoguht I noticed the difference in run speed ;) I certainly
notice it when I'm guiding folk who dont have it. You'd be surprised
how quickly you outdistance them. I'm hoping theres a fair number
of critters pegged at less than 10% faster than normal run ;)
