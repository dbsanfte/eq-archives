Public interest item, just something I'd like to see...

This is a thread to post stories from playing Everquest... logs, fictional
writeups, rants, any kind of story you can come up with is fine, I'd just
like to hear interesting/funny/exciting things that happen in everyday EQ
life :)

I'll probably post a few, but to start the thread off:

The other day I was sitting in the bazaar trying to sell two items I really
wanted to get rid of but didn't want to sell to the vendor.  I don't have a
bazaar mule so I wasn't really doing anything but staring at my chat screen
waiting for someone to buy from me, and it was a welcome relief to watch a
hilarious exchange on the ooc channel.  Some guy named "Unnerdy", claiming
he just created this char in his stepdad's EQ account, walks into the bazaar
and starts shouting about what a stupid and nerdy game EQ is, basically
letting everyone know that anyone who plays EQ is a fat turd who shits his
pants just so he won't have to leave his keyboard and whose sole contact
with the opposite sex is jacking off to amateur child porn, etc., etc.  Not
surprisingly, half the players in the bazaar starts making fun of him, at
which point he almost starts crying and tells everyone to "shut the hell
up!"  Turns out he's 15, or maybe 12, he didn't seem too sure on that point,
went back and forth, apparently depending on his mood.  But somehow he
couldn't understand why everyone hated him, or why nobody seemed inclined to
agree with his stereotyping.  He also wanted everyone to know what losers
they were to be playing a game on the weekend when they could be out
partying, and didn't seem to see the irony in the fact that he was logging
into a game to make an idiot of himself for two hours straight when
theoretically *he* could have been "out partying".  The general consensus at
the end of the whole conversation was that he must have been anally raped by
nerds in preschool, and was trying to have his vengeance in the one place he
was sure he'd find lots of nerds.  I just about died laughing :)
