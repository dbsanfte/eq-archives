I was on 56k dialup for a long time before I got broadband. PoP was out by
then. The information level that bounces back and forth is not out of the
ark for that sort of connect. All the fancy graphical updates are handled
client side not through the pipe. My machine handled it OK in that era.

Its not a twitch game so a bit of latency is not too much of a problem.
