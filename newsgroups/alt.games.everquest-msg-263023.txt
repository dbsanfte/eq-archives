That remains to be seen at this point.  So far, by invading Iraq, we have 
completely squandered what sympathy we had for what happened on 9/11 with 
just about every nation in the world, and further antagonized most middle 
eastern countries, including ones that were nominally friendly with us.  
At this time there does not appear to be any way out of the morass in 
Iraq.
