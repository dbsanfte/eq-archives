Anecdotal evidence:
Having plvl'd my rogue to I think 27 or so, his hide skill SUCKED when I 
started grouping and had to dump aggro.  So did his success rate on evade.  
I've noticed success on evade going up as I keep practicing hide (he's now 
lvl 30 and his hide has gone up over 60 points since 27, so it's not just 
level based).
