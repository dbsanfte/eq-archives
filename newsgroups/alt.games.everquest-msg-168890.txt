Been playing since release. In a guild with several 60+s. Spent a lot of 
time in NFP on MM and Drinal at the auctions (yes there were auctions 
before the bazaar). Personally, the "high end" doesn't appeal to me. The 
petty BS (by players and VI) I see there has kept all my characters under 
50. I HATE raiding. I HATE having to spend 4-6+ hours camping. I also have 
a life outside EQ. Doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about. Does 
the fact that my highest is only 47 mean I'm wrong? Terrible argument as 
several have pointed out before (see the DT thread a while back).
