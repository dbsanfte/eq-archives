Oh please. You saw a chance to snipe anonymously against a member
of a hated guild, and jumped it.

"Oh, no! I liked Joe Bob until I found out he was a supporter of
the Redwings / a Democrat / an NRA member. Now that I've learned
this, I have to hate him! Time to attack him in public fora!"

Here's a real interesting snippet from a previous post by Martin,
detailing some of the shit he's had to take because of his guild
tag:

[begin snip from <C2cz8.17157$Mi.3489907@news2-win.server.ntlworld.com>]

I was helping a small guild with a real bad PoF c.r (me and the guild leader
went back a loooong time), and I managed to find a few guildies to help me
with the C.R.  (It was really really bad.. 45+ people had got wiped out all
over PoF during the breakin, and almost all of them had used up all their
rez time)

Some stupid ungrateful pricks seemed to think 1 and a half groups of PDF was
actually coming to "steal the Demis" rather then help with the C.R  (when
your an NToV/Dain/Yeli guild, I really cant think of much use of PoF demi
items to be honest..)

I had made 2 high level groups (59 and 60) for the breakin.. reason being
59+ would have a tiny agro range, and 2 groups could easily deal with any
mobs that did agro).. anyway those over-imaginative dicks decided to come
train us (1 was level 48 or so, so easily agrod half the god damn zone)..
anyway they wiped out most of my "c.r" raid (some of the FD classes eat
death touches after they stood back up, which made it even more fun)

The original guild had tried a bunker break-in (impossible to C.R there) so
we had to move every single corpse to the nwall safe spot (which was now 60
or so bodies...), really really slow, as Death Touches at this point would
have been critical...

In the end there were 2 people left alive (2 monks), and a guildie monk I'd
asked for help was on way (he had a rez stick) by the time we had moved all
the bodies, and killed a few wanderers (its sad when you think 2 monks can
kill something that wipes half a lowbie raid heh), a lot of my C.R team now
had unrezzable corpses too...

8 hours later, the raid was finally all c.r'd.. and to think, all of that
was caused by a few selfish pricks with bs grievances against PDF (these
people had NEVER been hard done by, by PDF.. they were just following the
messageboards popular view, like the little sheep that they are)

[end snip]

I suppose you can laugh at him for that incident too, then? Cause if
you are, you've proven pretty damn well to *me* what kind of person
you are...

>>>So? After a long time lurking I finally felt moved to post.  Does
>>>that make my opinions less valid?

Let's see... Your first post is an attack on a regular contrubuter
to this newsgroup, posted anonymously... You then go on to defend
your attacks, and keep slamming Martin and his guild. No no, your
opinions are quite obviously treasures that must be revered by all
of the group.
