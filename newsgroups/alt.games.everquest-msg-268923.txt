Because of the other lines in the newsgroup setup, about it being a 
vanity group and so on, its likely that a lot of newsgroup servers won't 
carry it.  While its also likely that you can send a message to your 
newgroup server's administration and request it, most usenet readers 
won't even know it exists, and if they do, how many will actually bother 
to make that request?

IT could work, if we make a concerted effort here, that every time 
someone posts an EQ2 question or comment, they get jumped on and 
informed about the EQ2 newsgroup, sort of like what happens now every 
time anyone top posts.

Trouble is, there's a lot less consensus here about the desirability of 
that newsgroup; many, myself included, would rather keep both EQ1 and 
EQ2 in this single newsgroup, and just see people include the name of 
the game in their message header.  So you'd probably see a lot of 
counter arguement if you really pushed the new newsgroup.  (by "a lot" I 
mean far more than the people who attempt to defend top posting)

On the other hand, it would be fun to see whoever tried to grief poor 
Foxeye by doing this get his comeuppance by having the new newsgroup 
actually become popular.
