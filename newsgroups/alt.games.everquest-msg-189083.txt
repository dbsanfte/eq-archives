First of all, no one in the game *ever* has the authority or the right to
use profane language or to verbally abuse you in the game--I repeat, *ever*.
Whenever this happens do a /report <PC name>. Follow it up immediately with
a /petition and refer it to the report.

Whenever you do a /report, the last 10 lines in your chat window go with the
report. Note that I said the last 10 in the window, not the last 10 lines
written. Scroll up to the abuse before you do the report.

Next, to report the member, do a /who all "guildname". This will tell you
who the guild members are. Second, send a tell to one of the members and ask
for the name of the guild leader, or at least an officer. (If the person is
an officer, you might want to stick with the leader.)

Send a tell to that person when s/he logs on and explain what happened.
Don't elaborate--just state the facts. Most importantly, the goal you want
is to notify the officers of their members, not necessarily to have them
booted from their guild (although that could easily happen if they have done
this before).

Finally, move on. I am not saying this because I believe that you are
harping on this. What you don't want is for some nut to ruin your enjoyment
of the game. Believe me, if this is quid pro quo for this group of folks,
their reputations will precede them. They will find it very hard to find
folks to group with. Even worse. their guild will find it hard to get
support.

We have rejected many an application for membership because someone is
constantly accused of KSing, or camp stealing. SoE also takes a dim view,
and have terminated entire guilds, and suspended accounts for this reason
alone.
