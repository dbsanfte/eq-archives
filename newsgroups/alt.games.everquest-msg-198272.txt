I'm fairly new to EQ. I have a 42 Hafling Cleric. I'm fixing to roll a
Hafling Druid. One thing that I can't find out checking the various forums,
is accurate info on Hide and Sneak.

My Hafling Cleric has it but it's capped at 50 each.  Will a Hafling Druid
have the same caps??

Thanks in advance for your time in helping me.
