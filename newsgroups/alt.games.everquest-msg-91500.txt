Tell ya what - If bizbee can find some stats to back up his claim there are
only around 40 international EQ subscribers I will fire up google myself.

Until then which part of me not giving a rats arse about your opinions are
you not comprehending?

Still, the "evidence, case, dismissed, claim" quasi-legal superiority stance
was rather entertaining is a somewhat sad sort of way. Did you hear someone
mention the words "anal retentive" and not have "Lokari" in the same
sentence and get your nose put out perhaps?

Cheers.
