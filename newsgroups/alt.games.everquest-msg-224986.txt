Is it?  I know most everything I wear is "recommended" but I don't think I
have a single "required" level item.  Granted, I don't have any elemental
gear yet.  But I have auctioned several pieces (dkp bidding system in my
guild) and I don't recall seeing them as "required".  Haven't paid attention
to the elemental class armor, though, and can see it maybe being that way. 

Watch, I'll look at my equipment tonight and go "Doh, half my stuff is
required level 65".  :P
