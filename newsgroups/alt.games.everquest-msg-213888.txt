    Where are the NPCs that start the adventures for all five dungeon
themes?

    Where are the entries to each of the dungeons?

    Are the trap location and disarmarment spells on normal vendors, or must
they be purchased with LDoN adventurer points?

    What is the difference in point values between hard and easy settings?
Are we talking about twice the adventure points, 1.5 times as much, the same
but better loot drops in hard?

    The enhancements that can be purchased with points: can you see all of
them on a vendor at once, so you can plan your progression and know how much
work remains before milestones? Are the vendors the same from place to
place, or do different vendors have different things? As a specific
question: how many points would be required to buy the level 63 cleric group
BoR spell, and how many successful adventures does that represent?

    Dungeons: which dungeons seem to have a goodly number of undead mobs?
Which have no/almost no undead mobs?

    Interactive objects: are they targettable the same as NPCs are?

    That's all for now. ;-)

    James
