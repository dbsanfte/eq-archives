I wanted more - such as the ability to filter weapons, furniture,
clothes, armour, etc.

I hated getting to Artisan 12, and buying all the books, and taking 2
minutes to find the Chloro Resin recipe.

What makes it worse is that all the new recipes are added in
alphabetical order, but aren't integrated into the current list, so
all the recipes are in order of difficulty, THEN alphabetical.

I loking forward to retail as it means I'll finally be able to make
some suggestions on the officail forums - I could never get into the
beta forums.

And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
