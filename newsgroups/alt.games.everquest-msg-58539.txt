I was in TD this morning quadding raptors on the small island. I had 3
raptors ensnared and clustered. I moved past the building and ensnared
the vicious raptor.

CRUNCH!! A raptor has hit YOU for xxx damage!

WTF? The raptors should be nowhere near me. I moved quickly to the
waterline. CRUNCH!! Hit again. No raptors visible. Oh no. Sure enough,
packet loss at 30% and climbing steadily.

I ran out onto the ocean and cast gate in a desperate attempt to live.
I wasn't too worried about doing a CR in the water; been there, done
that, it's not so bad.

YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED. Sigh. I log back in. Character screen
shows I'm in TD. What the hell?

When I log in, I find I'm floating on the ocean near the small island,
full hit points (probably because of regrowth), full mana, fully
buffed except for Form of the Howler, with all my spells and
equipment.

No clue how I lived. I'm not complaining about this, just kinda
stunned. Any thoughts?
