con-sid-er. v.
1) To deliberate upon; examine
2) To think or deem

Considering is just a guess, dont trust it if you have so much trouble... or
find some new tactics
Kunark and Velious were designed mainly for groups
I can solo anything in the low 40s, sometimes up to 45, but after that I
never expect to solo anything
I have trouble with the drovwhatevers, but their whole species hit hard,
accurate, and usually double
