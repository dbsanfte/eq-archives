That may be the reason.  There seems to be a bunch of traders next to me.  
Some times an ogre or two.

I'm thinking - "it can't be my prices, wouldn't they use the search window 
first?"

In the past, I have gone through my log and read tells to me saying "lower 
your price on item X".  I usually do if I still have it.

Has anyone ever done a simple trend analysis of which days things sell the 
best?  I used to think it was Sundays but now I'm not so sure.  And the 
market is fickle.  One week item X is hot, next week I have to give them 
away and item Y seems more appealing.
