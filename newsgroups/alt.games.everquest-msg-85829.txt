He is just having a bit of trouble understanding how vendor diving works.

If the vendor is full, i.e. only two open slots at the bottom of his
inventory:
1.  Buy out one item.
2.  Sell him one item you are diving for.
3.  If the item appears in the empty slot, then the vendor has no more of
that item, buy back your one item, find another vendor.
4.  If the item does not appear in the empty slot, the vendor has more of
that item.
5. Click Done
6. Click on vendor.
7. If the item you want is at the bottom, buy until they are all gone, or
you don't want any more.
8. If the item is not on the bottom, buy out an item.
9. repeat from step 5.

If the vendor is not full, then you can see what he has for sale, no more
work needed.
