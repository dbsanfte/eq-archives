Question for you.

How often do you think a level 58 cleric casts a Complete Heal that lands
for more than 2925 damage healed?   Assuming an equal level / gear tank.


For all intents and purposes, druids have the exact same spell as complete
heal.  The bit higher mana cost when you hit 64 isn't significant either.
I'm sure the cheaper cost is a nice bonus for clerics, but it does not mean
in any way that druids won't be keeping up with heals just as well.
