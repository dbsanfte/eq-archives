Mob = Mobile Object.  Commonly, any monster you fight.  Usually single.

If you run with a kite on a string IRL, it follows behind you.  In EQ, to
kite is to get a monster mad at you (to 'aggro' it) and run away so it
follows you.  If possible, most people will reduce the target's run speed
(see Snare, below) to make it easier to outrun.  If your run speed is faster
than the monster's, you can damage it with spells.

There are several times of spells.  A 'Nuke' is any spell that does damage
to the monster all at once - it hits, it does damage, and the effect ends.
A 'DoT' (damage over time) spell is a spell that does a smaller amount of
damage initally, but continues doing damage over a period of time.

A Snare is a spell that reduces the target's movement speed.  Some Snares
are also DoTs, typically the ones used by necromancers.

Hope some of this helps.
