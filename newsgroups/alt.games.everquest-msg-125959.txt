"The SRo is the most heavily camped zone for the AC as the zone
is a Free For All. This simply means, if you see him first and
engage him it is yours."

Which just happens to be *exactly* what the PnP specifies for
*ALL* mobs.  If you see a mob and engage it first, it's yours.
Anywhere.  Any mob.  Period.  According to the PnP, anyway.

FFA != kill stealing.   FFA == no recognized "camp" rights.
You can't "camp" the AC in SRo;  you can camp the AC in OOT
(although the spawn in OOT is, according to the PnP, still
a FFA mob.  The PnP doesn't recognize camps.)
