My current system:

AMD 1.4 Tbird 512MB
Geforce 3 Ti 500
Cable connect.

This sounds like the perfect EQ setup, it was before post Luclin this is no
longer the case. At 1024X res I'm able to notice a considerable pause as the
game occasionally pause to load or rendener the sence and the game run at
the lower fps overall. I want to get my system running Luclin at the same
performance as it did with Velious (without Luclin model). Unfortunately I'm
not a millionare, but I do have around $400 to throw at the problem.

What is the best upgrade for my setup? A new GeForce4 Ti 4600 (128meg on
board..mmm) or dishing out for a set of 512 DDR memory?
