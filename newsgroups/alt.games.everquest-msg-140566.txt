America Online used to outsource it's technical support to a company called
Sitel... Sitel lost it's contract to AOL and now most of the AOL tech
support is locate in India as well.... It feels wrong having the phone
picked up and hearing Thank you for calling America Online technical support
in a very thick Indian accent....  I find it interesting that all sales are
still done in the U.S. by 100% english speaking americans... Corporate
America... got to love it, or should I say Corporate India
