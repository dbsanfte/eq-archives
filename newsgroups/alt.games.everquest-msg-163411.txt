I use OE5 on this box, and OE6 on the other box (you can tell which one I
post from... this box is 'rcsmiley', the other box is 'Rob Smiley')... and
first used OE3 to post to newsgroups... they ALL default to a 'top reply'
setting and I couldn't find anything in the Help File in OE5 about this
(/shrug)

Over the few years I've been posting to various Newsgroups I've got into a
few habits that are generally regarded as polite behaviour in just about all
the Groups I post to...

I don't like reading top-posts, so I avoid top-posting myself (which is just
common curtesy).
I don't post binary images to text-only groups... because not everyone is
lucky enough to have moved away from pay-per dial-up.
I (usually) snip my quotations down to the relevant parts that I'm actually
replying to... even if I don't add a <snip> marker for clarity.
If I'm *trying* to be funny, flippant or crude... I'll add a 'smiley' to
indicate it. If there's no 'smiley' and you find my post funny, then
consider it a bonus ;o)

A couple of other pointers... mainly aimed at the OP, but there are a few
others who could benefit ;o)

If you're trying to make a reasoned point... taking the time and effort to
use propper punctuation, correct grammar, and reasonably accurate spelling
along with cut/paste trimming, judicious use of interweaving replies and
generally taking care over your posting style will help to give you an image
as a reasoned and thoughtful poster.

If you're too lazy to correct something as simple as top-posting, then you
give the impression that you're too lazy to consider an idea thoroughly and
it follows that people will value your contribution less.

If someone takes the time to point out your posting ettiquette errors in a
polite manner, and you persist in demonstrating bad manners... or are even
crass enough to object to their helpful reminders... you're only going to
earn a reputation as someone with no desire to see the other persons'
side... and by consequence, a reputation as someone who it's not worth
entering into discussion with, because of that unreasonable attitude.

Anyone else have anything to add?
Agreement/support is welcome... as is reasoned and constructive criticism...
flames, however, will earn you a special place in something called a 'Kill
File' :o)
