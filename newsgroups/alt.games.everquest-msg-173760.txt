I have noticed this as well.

This is weird.

Two monsters will attack my pet.
MonsterA, MonsterB.

My pet begins to attack MonsterA, i mez MonsterB.
Pet finishes current attack on MonsterA, turns to MonsterB, and swings at
it, breaking mez.

I can repeat this very reliably now, and not sure exactly why its working
this way.
