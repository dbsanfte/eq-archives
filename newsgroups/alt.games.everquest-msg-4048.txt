no no, hehe..
Those map pieces are for the Eyepatch of Plunder, very nice high end melee
item,
You need 2 more map pieces in order to complete the quest. One from
Lodizal(lvl 60 turtle in IC), and the other is a side quest with that green
con uber bear in GD, you have a chanter charm him and give him 4 tizmak
meats which spawns a gnome, ask the gnome "I want the fourth map piece" and
he gives it to you
