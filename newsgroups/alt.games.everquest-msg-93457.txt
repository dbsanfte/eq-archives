I just need to have a moan about this one.

I wrote to EQ Tech with this problem. They wrote back to me today (about 5
days later!). They suggest that I press the "Register Upgrade" button in the
Server Status screen! I would have thought it pretty obvious that I have
tried this seeing as how I told them that I have already upgraded to Luclin
without any difficulty (how dumb do they think I am?). Like I said, I have
waited about 5 days for this reply and having written to them again today
I'm guessing it's going to be another 5 days before they send me another
insult.

I needed to get that one of my chest, I'm feeling better already.

Bart
