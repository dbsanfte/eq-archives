Yep we can't (and therefore can't use this wonderful JBB). Get
yourself clad in Mystic Scale. The quests for it all start with two
NPC's in East Cabilis in the upper level of a ruined house (near
Shammy/SK castle - exit to Field of Bone). Tell them 'oxyn sent me'
and they will reveal what they can do for you. It requires gems (you
can buy them in the gem shop  near the bank) and no drop items from
all over kunark zones closer to Cabilis. You can often ask groups to
loot those items for free. Some items require longer travel, like a
golra hide. This is pretty good mid-level armour (at level 57 I still
wear some, then again I'm not very uber). Later (i.e. after level 46),
you can try to go to hate and get Scaled Heirophant armour pieces. I
currently have the SH bp (which is AC26, +16 wis, some more stats and
resists), so we also get pretty decent AC with time. At top level, we
can wear velious armours with AC up to 45ish and more, which should be
your endgoal for now, unless you make it into a 55+/60 uberguild and
get some even better stuff (vindi bp etc)

Don't have one, but go to allakhazam's website and search items for
mystic scale or scaled heirophant :)
