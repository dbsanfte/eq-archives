Um no.  I will always pick the Knight, *unless* I know the Warrior to be
of the highest caliber personality and skill.  Call me inexperienced if
you will, but you cannot call the leader of these groups, a 65 Enchanter
who just dinged 400 AA a few nights ago who also bots the cleric and
shaman (Rak gets to play wizard in these groups, he has a hoot of a good
time), inexperienced.

Absolutely.  I love experienced Warriors.

Sir, I know I keep picking on you, but do you realize that "I use tuant
everytime the key becomes available" is actually doing jackshit to help
your aggro?  You *save* the taunt button until you need it.  Save it for
after the slow, for after the heal, or after someone else gets aggro.  If
you cannot understand this, then visit the Steel Warriors boards and ask
more experienced warriors to explain to you how your taunt button works.

Please tell me you just slipped up, because I'm embarassed just reading
your post.
