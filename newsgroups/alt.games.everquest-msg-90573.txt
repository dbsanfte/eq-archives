What Verant does for non US customers: Sells the product, takes their money.
What Verant doesn't do for it's non US customers: It doesn't provide a tech
support help-line, so they have to make an international call and get put on
hold. Provides 1 non US server for the thousands of non US players. Shuts
down that server with all the others even though that is at peak playing
hour for non US players. Never responds to tech support queries, except to
tell them to phone the tech support number even after it has been made clear
that they do not live in the US. Doesn't advetise or make the product widely
outside the US. Sets up great conventions for players in the US but nothing
for those outside the US.

Paramount pictures is a US company. Yet it makes it's Star Trek products
widely available around the world and sets up conventions outside the US
too.

Ok, heres your que, all you whiny pissant US flamers who are gonna say, "oh
yeah so what, I live in the US, so I don't give a shit."
Get ready you sad pathetic gimps outside the US, and defend the lovely,
cuddly Verant who loves us all so very much.

Whatever your response, just do one thing. Prove that my comments about
verant are wrong.

Oh and btw, lets have no, "your the sad pathetic whiner" or "if you hate eq
why are you still playing the game" or "learn how spell, or learn correct
grammer" soooo old and boring. Oh and no "your the old boring one"

Get off you flabby arse and excersise your brain for more than just
concentrating on jerking off your dick to internet porn.

Oh and no "your a sad pathetic loser for posting this in the first place" A
5 year old could come up with that.

And dont put one of those stupid quotes at the bottom of your post, what a
pissant dorkish thing to do, like it makes you clever and smart and one of
the intectual elite. It's just the sort of loser thing internet geeks do cos
they think it's "cool". Well it's only cool to other geeks. And if you
defend it then you are a true nerd yourself.
