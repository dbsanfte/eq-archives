"Over a hundred"??  I'm only a low-level, but I can't imagine having to 
eye a screen for the spell I need from out of 'over a hundred' when I'm 
in the middle of an important raid.  15, maybe... but I prefer someone 
else's idea of having 2 spell gem configurations that you can switch 
between - because I have vastly different spell preferences for when I'm 
travelling and when I'm fighting.
