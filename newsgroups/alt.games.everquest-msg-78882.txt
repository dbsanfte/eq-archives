Yeah I'm on the look out for a Crude stein, I just got my Stein of Mogguk
(quested) and forgot to check the vendor in Ogguk for any!!! Doh!

Not really working particulary on getting any stats up.

The Drake-Hide leggins would be useful, may take a trip to Solusek eye.

Couldn't find Oppaline earrings on any of the search item engines on various
websites. Where/what are these from?

Thx to you and Empty

Cheers
