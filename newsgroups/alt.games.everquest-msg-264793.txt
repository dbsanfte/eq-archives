The descriptions I've seen of Wards make them seem only somewhat
similar to runes;

A) cast by priests, rather than enchanters
B) much shorter timer... a rune tends to last a long long time, unless 
broken by damage.  Sounds like a ward lasts long enough for a single 
pull... and might not last thru a single fight even if not broken by damage.
C) Ward is also a heal, when the ward timer is up the hp remaining are 
applied to damage
D) no material component for ward... most runes expended a gem, and 
could be quite a cash drain, even if you were rich/twinked, heavy use of 
them as a heal would rapidly drain stacks out of your bags.

Wards seem to resemble a cross between a rune and the HOT lines of heal 
like Celestial Elixer... or since they seem to be the shaman healing 
method, comparing to Torpor/Quintessence might be a fair comparison 
(although with several important differences)
