    Ah, ok. Not many people seem to kill stuff in there, so there's a ton of
No Drop items from there you never hear about. I think that's why Oiled
Greaves are so rare on my server - nobody kills there.

    If it's free, go for it! And you can get Plat Tiaras for dirt cheap in
The Bazaar. I'm just saying if you wanted to camp it, the area would give
you XP.

    No. It's only a one INT upgrade from what you have now. It's more of a
"well, I can XP in a bunch of places, but I'll go here because I'll use one
of the possible drops".

    Was it the Crystalline Spider Fur Belt? That one is AC 1 WIS/INT 3
HP/MANA 20.

    They're in an odd spot, and they come in two and threes when pulled. The
AoE groups on my server have them as part of the standard "things to kill",
so you at least know their resists aren't so bad.

    Some of the Velious quest armour is just crap. But you're a monk, so you
already knew that. ;-)

    Depends what the price difference is between EBoots and CSB's on Prexus.
It's a really fair-sized chunk of +MANA.

    The rough guide is: before 200 INT, 1 INT = (level/5) MANA. Above 200
INT, 1 INT = (level/10) MANA.
