Now, this takes care of my single biggest gripe about EQ.  There have been
many times my Paladin has gotten a case of wanderlust, but stayed put
because she didn't feel like playing the "wait for a bind" game.  WTG,

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
