It will still have to pass the `fun' test. In theory having degrading
weapons and a vibrant player economy is good fun. However it's a
very delicate balance to keep the rate of degradation `acceptable'
and drops common enough that it's not an issue. And it's failed
far more often than it succeeds. The DaoC people aren't too happy
about it (and trading is dead there) and I still remember diablo2
warriors going broke because of excessive wear and repair on
weapons.
