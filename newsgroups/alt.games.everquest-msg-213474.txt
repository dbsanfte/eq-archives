act like getting in game as normal, when patcher quits and you are on
first screen, hit account, log in if needed

Hit change billing. 

You are at a screen that says EVERQUEST  and ALL ACCESS.
Hit everquest, pick a plan, etc.

Or just end billing, then resubscribe with the new card when your
current time runs out. You can resubscribe with the new credit card
number any time of the day or night, with it automatically being
accepted. You'll still be able to play your characters fine in the
meantime, before your time runs out.
