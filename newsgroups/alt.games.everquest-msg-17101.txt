Good grief you really have got a bee in your bonnet about something havent
you?  Calm down?  Isnt it totally, completely and utterly obvious that I
think they 'should make it easier to start up after some time'?  Perhaps I
should have used those exact words?  hmmm but then maybe some other raving
loony would chastise me for not using some other exact phrase eh?  I guess
(probably without even realising it) you are admitting I am right, that *it
should* be easier to start up after some time, well gosh thanks for
agreeing, you could have been a little less insulting though eh?

'Taken care of business at my end'....eh? wtf are you on about?  I should
have been able to remember the account details for a game afer 2 years?  Its
not really hard to forget such things you know.  Sure its not Verants fault
I forgot them but it *is* their fault that they do not seem to have a system
to cater for such an eventuallity and I am sure they would not be too
surprised to find out that this could cause frustration for their customers.
Its just so fucking obvious that people are sooner or later gonna forget
this stuff if they dont play for a long period of time.  Ok I did bitch a
bit in my first post (I also clearly laid out my problem and asked for help
so I didnt 'just bitch' eh?). I also emailed em and got a quick but not at
all helpfull reply, next step an international phone call to the states.  As
for them coming to my house etc etc well no, I just want them to 'make it
easier to start up after some time' ok?  Anyway like I said, try and calm
down eh? you dont owe Verant anything, we are their customers, its their
responsibilty to make sure stuff like this does not happen, well I think so
anyway, you may well have a different point of view.

Paul.
