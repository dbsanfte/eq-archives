My rl friend has a 65, 200 aa ranger which he has put on the shelf for
his (now) 65, 25ish aa wizard.  I mentioned that I thought his ranger
would be a better tank than my BL (who is within 50-60 ac and 200 HP
unbuffed now) because he has taunt, where as I have to rely on spells.
His reply, when he stopped laughing, was that all he ever saw from taunt
these days was the fail message :-P

Now the question is - is snare+flamelick better taunt than slow+incapaciate
+Sicken (cheap, very fast casting)?
