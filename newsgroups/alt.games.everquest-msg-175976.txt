They will horribly out of date.

I price /trader items acording to: What others are asking, and the what I'd
like to buy it for (if I were a shopper).  If all are selling for 2000p,
then pricing it at 1500p will get it sold a *alot* faster.  I consitantly
see people with high-priced items that never change the price (and the item
really aint worth that much).

If you want to move items, then price them low enough that people can't
resist them, but you can still make some money for you hard work.
