The amount of xp required to get to level 50 is the same.  The number of
mobs you have to kill has gone down significantly.  I can vouch for this
with absolute certainty for pre level 10.  Jazz posted some log parsing he
did for level 18 after patch vs several levels below that prepatch to show
how much easier it was for him to level post patch.

I'm not going to say they have ruined the game as a result, but I get the
feeling they did go a bit too far, at least for the low levels.  I always
had difficulty keeping my skills maxxed at low level before, now I find it
completely impossible.  The low level character I am playing is a level 4 DE
cleric, he was twinked with a Bronze mantle, and a FS staff (which he sold
to buy spells), and a FS mace (his current weapon).  Everything else he is
wearing he made from ruined wolf pelts, or by completing level appropriate
quests.  His 1HB skill is below 5 still, his Offense is 3 or so, his Defense
is 9.  His casting skills, other than Evocation are all below 5.  Next test
is to take one of my midteens characters back into Befallen.
