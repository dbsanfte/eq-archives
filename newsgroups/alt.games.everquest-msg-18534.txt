OK, just running down what you need to do.  (I'm sure you've done all these
steps, but bear with it, I got mine to work doing it this way.  :P)

Click on Tools --> then Internet Options--> then make sure you're on the
general tab, type in the URL for the page you want to set as your homepage,
then click on Apply.

That should do it, right?
