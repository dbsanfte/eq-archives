I never said you said this.  I said you brought up the issue adequately 
described by this phrase.  I believe I (and others) have explained the 
flaw in the 'if you don't like it, killfile them' argument, but what the 
hey.

Generally, when you make this argument, those who -would- killfile you, 
already have.  The rest won't, because (a) they don't know how their 
killfile works, and it's too much trouble, (b) they hold out the faint 
hope you might redeem yourself by saying something interesting, or (c) 
they actually enjoy watching you flail around like a stuck pig.  So, if 
you find yourself on the verge of making this argument, skip it.  Save 
yourself the time and energy.  Consider whether you really want to lose 
category (b) from your readership and give yet more pleasure to category 
(c).  Then back up, figure out what you did to get yourself in this 
situation, and strongly consider not doing it again.

}I was jumping into a thread which was about top posting.  See answer to
}your first point.

The thread under discussion, the 'bottom poster being caned' thread, is 
one -you- started.  If you'd like to discuss some other thread, we can 
move on to that later.  But given it's a thread -you- started, it's very 
hard to give much credence to a claim that you 'jumped into' it.

}> You included statistics which were roundly proven to be incorrect,
}> whether because you made them up, or your statistical experiment
}> suffered from poor sampling techniques.  It's amazing what you can
}> prove with anally extracted statistics.  The majority of the error
}> was in that you counted numbers of posts, rather than numbers of
}> posters.  Since this included the same 5-6 people top posting "no
}> it's not!" 5 bazillion times, this easily biased the experiment.
}The "experiment" as you termed it was based off my count over a 2 day
}period in all the groups I subcribe to.  I guess this is a question of
}semantics.  If TomG in the alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit posts over
}10% of the posts (current count of 101 of 900 posts on my news server
}and he is a top poster non-snipper), my newsreader XanaNews breaks down
}the posting list. And others with large posting counts such as PRIVATE
}1964, Amir Facade, Robert, FN, Justin Clark, Bill and I could go on
}(all are top posters).  I assume you are saying that because 30% of the
}posters are top posters that does not make a top posting newsgroup even
}if they contribute well over 50% of the posts?

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.  Bravo.  You can add a gold star to 
your reading chart now.  This is the same as, if End Times Prophet were to 
return, and more than 50% of the posts in a.g.e were suddenly useless 
bullshit, that would not make a.g.e a newsgroup specifically 
intended for the dissemination of useless bullshit.  Similarly, a top 
poster, particularly with a dander infection, posting a huge number of top 
posts to a group where 70% of the posters prefer bottom posting, in no way 
makes that a top posting newsgroup.

}> }At no stage did I defend top posters or any type of poster.  I did

}killfile them do not abuse them.

This is cute.  Translation: "I do not remember defending top posters, I 
do remeber saying things that might easily be interpreted as a defense of 
top posters."  Troll score: 1.7.

}> Sorry, but there it is.  You also,
}> in the very first post in the thread, included a direct taunt, to
}> wit: "join the fray Ben Sisson and the wet cat."  
}IIRC This was on the "bottom poster gets caned thread not the original
}thread.

Exactly.  It was in the thread currently under discussion.  Well spotted.

}I do not remember the FAQ in my time in here and it is not posted at

}Sisson et al appear not to have read the bit in the FAQ about treating
}others as you would want to be treated (or perhaps they have). Thanks
}you for being the first to answer my question.

You're welcome.  

}> Allow me to quote it again: "join the fray Ben Sisson and the wet
}> cat." No, no provocation at all.
}Again if memory serves me well that was on the "Bottom poster gets
}caned" thread. When I had my dander up still.

Dander is bad, mmmkay?
