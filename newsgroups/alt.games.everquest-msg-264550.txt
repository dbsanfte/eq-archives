It would make sense that it's not in yet, that in order to test the results
of skill usage that they're forcing all characters' skills up periodically.
They know (or should know) how to set it for aperiodic increases, as that's
what EQ1 does, so, set it on forced group skillups now, and you guarantee
that the players have the skills available to be tested in combat or other
actions.  Instead of waiting for someone to dutifully practice Swim up to
100, just set everyone to gain 10 per level.
