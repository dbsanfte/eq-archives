Mage: Cleric can heal your pet which would supplement a mage quicte well.
Necro: Once you can fear kite you dont need a cleric
Druid: Cant see how these classes would group well.
Paladin: Will work fine, and easy to expand to a larger group.

Cleric-enchanter could be interesting. Chanter pet can tank fine when the
mobs are slowed. More dps than the paladin, and less downtime (unless youre
just buying KEI). Wont work at low levels tho... no slow, no haste, no dual
wield pet, and no clarity.
