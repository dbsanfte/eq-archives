"charactername.opt" files store all of your hotkeys
and configuration settings (eqclient.ini) on your own
PC.  They are a couple of the very few things stored
on your own computer, and pretty useless to "hack."

IMHO, it's also one of the reasons EQ has lasted so
much longer than the other MPOG's out there, no
"Bloodbath on my level 2 rogue" hacks and other such
"fun."
