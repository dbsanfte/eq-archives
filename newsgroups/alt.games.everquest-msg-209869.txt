I started mine at level 26 or 27.  Purely by accident, as I didn't know 
that killing Pegleg in Butcherblock would spawn the spirit needed to start 
the epic.  Fortunately, I had read up on the epic, so I knew what was 
happening, and, got my epic started.  I don't recall what level I did each 
step at, but, I did the first few steps when I stumbled upon the spirit 
like that.  Stumbling block for me for a while was the Erud's Crossing 
part, as, even with invis to animals up, I was getting hit by a killer 
shark.  I believe I finally got past that part in my 30s.  I ended up 
completing my epic at level 58.
