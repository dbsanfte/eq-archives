And the reduction in practice is actually greater than that for DoTs
that run full length and do not have a dmg/tick that is divisible by
5.  So, the mob dies a little faster, but at higher mana cost (just
as if you were to use nukes to speed its death), resulting in more
time sitting around between kills.  So, that's a good thing, right?
an increase in the penalty for soloing my Druid (idle med time) will
encourage me to group, right?  Except for the piddly little detail
that now when I'm grouped I will contribute _less_ damage than before
(if I DoT a mob when grouped it's because it _isn't_ going to die
before the DoT runs out).  Oh well, I've been waiting four years to
get nerfed (never had the right class and/or level before), I guess
it's about time.  ;)
