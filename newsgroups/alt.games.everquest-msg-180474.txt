Cool!  Game movies can be really cool...especially if you use good music and
edit them well.  Although not from EQ, here are some links to good examples:

http://camelot.stratics.com/movies/Aladora.shtml

Take a look in particular at "Hero", "For Albion", and "Dreams".  "Darkness
Falls" was pretty good, too.  Actually, pretty much everything Aladora makes
is good.

For some reason, there are a lot of people making DAoC movies.  Go up a
directory there to get to some others, and there's also a movies section at
camelotvault.ign.com with some good stuff.
