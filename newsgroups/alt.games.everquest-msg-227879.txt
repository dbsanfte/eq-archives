I inspected a box with my Rogue just before a pull and every one swore
I set the trap off with my inspect.  Everyone died. I told them to
scroll up and read what happened.  I was in combat when the enchanter
casted AE mez.  The mez set off the trap.

I gave them a nice talking to when they figured it out.

I have never set off a trap with inspect.
