If I were a warrior I would consider using copper hammer of striking
(CHoS) and sword of the bloodsworn.  Both proc at level 1.  The
recommended level on the dmg/dly was broken as of at least a couple
weeks ago.  I gave my level 1 cleric frog twink a CHoS at she was
hitting 16 max and proccing, albeit rarely because of horrible
dexterity.  

I imagine have 2 stun procs would be very fun for a twink low-level
warrior =)
