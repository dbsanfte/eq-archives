Are you sure you lose XP if you die as a result of a DOT while duelling 
on a blue server? Why is that?

I jumped in the Arena in the Bazaar once whne I was in my 30's, and 
immediately a level 60 Shaman put a DoT on me. It wasn't long before I 
was running back to retreive my corpse :/ If you do lose XP as a result 
of a DoT, then wouldn't Shamans, Necros and Druids be totally avoided in 
duels?
