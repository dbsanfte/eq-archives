Ok, I see there's a lot of confusion on this one. The "good 'ole boys"
over at Steel Warriors have been doing some fairly exhaustive testing of
all the haste items (at least the warrior usable ones, heh) available
and published the results. Updated as of 2/5/02.  The list below didnt'
originally have the FRSS in it, but was added a few posts down, so I
tacked it in here to save you clicking, etc.  The FRSS came in at 6%
haste. Here's a direct link to the thread if you want the background or
to ask questions to the people doing the testing:
