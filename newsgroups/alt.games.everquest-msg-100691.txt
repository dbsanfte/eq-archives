I'm trying to figure out how you decided a Lammy is the best weapon
out of that group.

First off, the Wurmslayer has the highest damage/delay ratio at .625
(25dam and 40del means 25/40=.625 exactly, the higher the number the
better the ratio.)  Next is the Centi LS at approximately .51, and the
Lammy is last at .47.

Not to mention, that with a fast weapon you will be generating a lot
more aggro than with a slower weapon.  And aggro for ranger is a bad
thing.

My ranger is swinging a Wurmy, with a Velium Short Blade in the off
hand.  TONS o' damage and I don't usually draw any aggro.  Only
downside to the Wurmy is that it's HEAVY, and on long fights you'll
find yourself getting pretty tired out.  Fortunately, rangers in
Invigor, so you'll have a way to deal with it.
