Just the reason I don't like MS.  No Loot, poor XP per kill.  I seem to
do far better elsewhere.  Any-elsewhere.  Definately no ZEM there.  I
found Unrest to be the best zone at this level, of course that's for a
cleric :)

This is the other reason I didn't like it.  Fortunately one time when we
got a good group we decided to go to DSP instead, and we did much much
better there.

Lol..  I see a lot of people with the HP buffs running around. 
Admittedly not as many as with kei, but enough to be careful about
watching people's HP bars, and asking so I know what kind of threat I'm
really up against.
