On the Esther the Tester boards, there was a request for feedback on
broken and/or problem quests. One of the comments was that the drop of
frogloc eyes in Guk was so rare as to make a lot of people ask if they
had been taken out of the game. It was indicated that they might up the
drop rate "slightly" so you'd have some reasonable chance of getting
them. I'm guessing this might be a reference to that.

The same thread indicated that the respawn time for Tiny in the Karanas
would be moved from a month to a week. Similar reason.
