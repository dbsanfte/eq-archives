Popped at 7:00 pm last night. Dead in under five minutes. Gratz to
Ivorry of <Azure Legion> on Xev for her new clicky. Bastage was kind of
stingy on the loot table, but did drop two red scales, one of which went
to one our guild's MAs. Also dropped that bazaare BP... the one with ...
what? Twenty AC? Went to a Pally I believe. Dragon meat, a diamond, a
cleric spell.

One other guild in zone, but they were very cool about it and stayed
clear. A very clean Rage kill.

Thank gawd that's over. 
*sigh*
