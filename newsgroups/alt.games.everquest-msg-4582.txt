WHy mem only 2?  If you -know- you are going to be fighting
caster mobs, load 3, and you will be able to keep the caster mob
from casting 100% of the time excepting fizzles and resists.  In
fact you can completely shut down -any- mob that doesn't have
good resist, which is where your chanter can make things interesting.
Even better, these are really low cost spells relative to what they
can do for you.

That first Stun spell, though, is an "always mem."  Its extreme low
cost short cast time and the fact that it has no damage component, makes
it extraordinarily versatile.  I use it to pull, as its a cheap shot that
doesn't put me high on the hate list, and it gives me extra running
time to get back to the party.  I use it to run away, as again all
you really need is a little head start, mobs mostly don't run
faster than a healthy PC.  I use it to allow tanks a chance to taunt
a mob off someone (or me)  or the chanter to mez.... best part is
if the mez goes off before the stun, stun doesn't break the mez. I even
use it to stop runners; sure a good solid nuke would do that job too,
by killing the mob, but the tanks are usually perfectly capable of
dropping it if it stands still for them for a round, and my mana outlay
is much lower than it would be on a comperable nuke.

Because the stun effect is the main thing I'm looking for, if I -do-
mem 2 stuns, its likely that I"ll mem just stun and holy might, as
the -cheapest- two.

Tough part is educating your group members as to the nature
of the root park.  Time and time again you'll face party members
who insist on standing in melee range of the parked mob.  At least
its less annoying than people breaking mez, but it does make the
effort largely a waste of time.  With a well trained party, though,
a cleric can do some fairly effective crowd control work with
root, and as Cadfael says, I'd keep it loaded unless you have
a -very- good need for something else you are sure that the
situation won't call for you to do CC.
