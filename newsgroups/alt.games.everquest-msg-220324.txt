I don't know how many of you have run across this guy yet, but there
is a new mob in Field of Bone called "a rotting flesh hunter".  It
kind of looks like a little gray dinosaur and I got jumped by it on
the north side of the pit area.  It's supposedly only a level 14 mob
but it was hitting me for like 62 points damage each time (I didn't
even bother fighting it, just zoned into Kurns Tower), and apparently
from what I have read on other message boards, it has like about
5000-7000 HP and even players in their 50s said it took them a while
to kill it off, though it does start the death march when it gets to
50% health.  Apparently the only thing it drops is zombie flesh.  

There's more info about it available at:
