    "MaloX seems to have about..." Seems TO WHO? "That could be pure

    From my previous post:

    "So alternate who is responsible for
getting stuff slowed and who is responsible for malX (since no one shaman
likes getting pounded all night)"

    Eventually, the one shaman assigned to slow gets pissed at being the
only shaman to die/get smacked around on pulls. So you alternate. For
someone that bitches about reading comprehension you sure seem to have
issues of your own.

    We assist heal off mobs, although the more malicious clerics won't heal
anyone that shouldn't have early aggro. Or the clerics more interested in
self-preservation, hard to tell them apart sometimes. ;-) You do have to
make sure the clerics know who is pulling, though, or else someone not in
pull will /assist heal the puller with predictably disastrous results. For
stuff that requires a CH chain, we have the chain rolling when the tank
engages. CH isn't exactly a "reaction heal", after all.

    Unlikely. How often does a wizard attempt to nuke before Malo lands,
especially seeing as how it cannot be resisted?

    Snare? On a raid mob? Druids do join, though, for their resist debuffs,
or they do it in the druid-specific channel.

    Yes.

the

    Only reason a mage would be there is if they're doing mal-line. Casters
aren't limited by time so much as by aggro, so waiting for aggro to be
established before nuking pretty much ensures you're nuking a debuffed mob.

> Of course the tanks will want to know when the mob is slowed.

    Um, no. They tank it whether it's slowed or not - that's their job.
/disc use? Don't see people blowing /discs on trash mobs because they want
them available for minis or bosses. I swear that every warrior has a Word
document where they list every boss they've tanked to completion, they get
so competitive over it.

> And
> the clerics, so they can adjust accordingly...

    If you're assist healing, you heal whatever you get on assist if it's
hurt. If you're in a chain, your timing is pretty much fixed at fastest
possible. It's not like I say to myself, "Hmm, that mob that quads 1300 is
slightly slowed (high mitigation). I think I'll use a slower heal on that
caster that got aggro, I bet they live long enough!"

:P

    The only people that need to know about debuffs are the people
responsible for it. All the rest of the raid needs to know is that the
debuffers do their jobs in a timely fashion, and they do need to be alerted
if a given debuff isn't sticking (since it usually implies something more
about the inherent resists of the mob). They don't need debuff info on top
of raid instructions on top of whatever channel-specific information they
get.
