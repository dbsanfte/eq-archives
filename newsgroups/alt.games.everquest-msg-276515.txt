Sounds like a nice reward.  I wonder how hard it is to do (as opposed
to solve) the hunt?  Last year my characters were too low level to do
it themselves, but my monk tagged along with a high level friend and
managed to finish the scavenger hunt to get the fireworks staff, which
is nice to have for celebrations but has no real utility.  This potion
is something I'd like to be able to get for all my characters.  (I'm
assuming it's no drop and lore.)

Likewise, my characters weren't able to take on any of the Fabled NPCs
last year.  I'll have to look them up again and see which rewards I'm
interested in trying for.  I wonder whether the reduced population will
translate to less insane camping of the fableds?

I'm also relieved to see no mention of further tradeskill triv changes.
I spent all last week collecting ingredients for brewing practice, and
for two nights before the patch was madly using them up just in case
the update made Kaladim Constitutionals useless for skilling up to 300.
Did 1200 combines for 44 skillups, so I still need a few more to finish
the job.  (On the bright side, I now have lifetime supply of KC's banked
across two mules. :-)

One other change I noticed that didn't get mentioned: they apparently
decided too many people couldn't find their way around the bazaar, so
they've blocked off half the passages between spokes to make it easier
for people to figure out which path leads back to the hub.  I guess
putting up a sign to mark the hub path would've required new artwork,
while sticking in a door let them use art they already had?  Sheesh.
