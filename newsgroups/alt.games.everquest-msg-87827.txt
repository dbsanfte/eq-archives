I know this is a common rant but what the hell. This morning after all the
server came up except 8 I spent almost 2 hours trying to login, Queues full.
After the last 8 servers came up I was able to log in on 2 accounts within
10 minutes. I was just curious how many people can CAMP in the queues wait
for their server to come up. I know we all have done it sometime or another
trying to be the first on the server. I just never realized (call me
stupid), or thought about how many people I am keeping from logging onto an
operational Server. I don't know how many people the Queues can hold but
think about it 50-100 players per server waiting in the Queue for their
server to come active.
