A new BP is a must, your current Bp has barely more ac than your legs, thats
not a good sign.
Depends on your server but acryila breastplates can be a good upgrade path
for not alot of cash

AC 30 Str 5 HP 15 SV 10

I got my little war one for around 500pp

A FBSS ? Yucky-yuck-yuck, I've never been a fan of these, haste is important
but at the cost of AC and stats ?
I love the Silver chitin handwraps

AC 10 plus a shed load of other stats, of course they are hand slots so its
going to mean dropping the cobalt (or keeping them in your pack for the
effect), but with the ac gain you will get from your waist (Chitinous belts
are only 200pp or so and have 13 ac) its not going to be a massive loss if
any at all.

I've seen SCHW for as little as 2k, and with FBSS still going for anywhere
up to 1.8-2k its not going to eat into your savings too much.

And like someone else said, drop the wurmy and do it fast, I was fighting
alongside a war using a Wurmy and CLS combo and he didnt stand a chance of
keeping aggro off me, that was before I even started using spells, In the
end I had to switch to my least DPS weapons and stop casting all together
and still it was touch and go.

Get yourself a nice Lammy (got one for 650pp the other day) it will make the
world of diffrence.

As for ears, well thats always a stumpling block for me too, the earing of
the solstice is nice for the stats, but its not cheap (I got mine of 5.5k)
