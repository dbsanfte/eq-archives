There a melee class, they hit harder than a warrior but cant take the same
beating as one.   Ive found mine good to play through until i got to about
lvl50, they dont seem to be balanced right at the moment and if you goto
websites such as www.berserker.org you will see they feel the same way, im
sure sony will get around to them sometime soon though, and then they should
be a good class to play.

As for stats i would put my bonus points in STA, as you can use gear to
raise STR pretty easily.

They also have abilities you can use which can snare/stun mobs during
combat, just having these at hand makes it more fun than being a warrior as
i felt more involved.
