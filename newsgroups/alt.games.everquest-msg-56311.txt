>What quest is this Bread Run, please?

Give Jarlen Meadowgreen (a centaur in SK, located at 91, -2251) 2gp and he will
give you a "Bag of Bread Loaves" (LORE NO-DROP). Give the "Bag of Bread Loaves"
to various innkeepers for faction.  Give the "Bag of Bread Loaves" to Innkeeper
Morpa (an ogre in Feerrott, located at 1145, -131).

Faction hits:
+MerchantsofOggok
+Clurg
+OggokGuards

Regards,
John
