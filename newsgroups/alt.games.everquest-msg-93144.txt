 I don't know if it still works, but I lost my note when I first started
playing (before they had the quest to get it back). I remember that I
created a level one monk and used that to get the shackle of dust an
multiquested to get the next shackle. Seems easier than dealing with the
toilmaster, but It's entirely possible that this has been nerfed.
