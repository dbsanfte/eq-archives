Stinging Swarm is conjuration based  While a pain in the
arse to do, your only other conjuration spell is Dance of
the fireflies.  You will only be able to practice at night,
but cast it over and over again, til you conjuration skill
goes up.  Druids have it a little easier in that they also
get summon food and drink to practice with, but there isn't
alot of conjuration spells for either class before this
point.  My druid probably spent an hour summoning food to
get my skill up to maxed when i got stinging swarm at 14.

Hope that helps
