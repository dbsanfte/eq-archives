<physicsnerd>
There are such things as matter "lasers".  While technically they are
not Light amplifiers, they use the quantum nature of matter in a
similar way to a laser to  create a coherent stream of matter emitted
out one end.  So I don't see any reason why you couldn't make one that
fires anti-matter, other than the fact that anti-matter is pretty hard
to create.
