*supposed to be covered by guides* 24-7.

Actually scheduled will depend on your individual server, and is up to the
guides to schedule. So your guess is as good as mine. Guides are not
supposed to be anon. Although actual GMs usually are. And the roaming GMs
will often visit servers with a known gap in guide schedules.
