This is true. However, if your inventory consists of 6 bags and 2
items (therefore, it's full), then as long as you leave the stuff in
the bags, there is no problem. Four bags and two items go into the
trade window, four bags and two items go neatly back into your
inventory. Someone wants to see a particular item, I take it out of
the bag and put it in the trade window. When the trade is cancelled,
it goes right back into the bag/slot from which it was taken (assuming
all bags are full - otherwise it will naturally go into the first
available slot of course). You kind of have to go out of your way to
hose yourself here.

I do this myself quite often. If I am trying to buy low/sell high to
earn enough for that Centi Shortsword, I will be looking for any good
deal I can find. That sometimes means just checking out everything a
person is selling. In those instances, I would rather see bag sellers.

I agree. If I say "Selling bag of stuff...", don't send me a tell
asking what I'm selling. Come and take a look. If I wanted to list all
the items, I would have done so.

It would be less trouble to just show me than to type out the
description more often than not. If you put ALL the pertinent info in
the /auction, then you won't hear me ask. However, if you don't
include a complete description (rarely do people include weight or
size and often they leave out class/race usable for example) or just
say "Selling all on me..." then I'm gonna ask to see it if I'm
interested.
