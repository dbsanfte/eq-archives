I don't think it is as simple as that.

I suspect that it is a combination of hardware....Soundcard,
Motherboard Chipset, Processor, etc. If I had to make a guess, I would
say that the people with the most problems are running VIA chipset
equiped motherboards.

What we need is a poll of people with SBLive! cards that do work with
Win2K and XP, and see what they are using for motherboard chipsets and
processors.
