In another thread, I asserted that Root can be broken only by DD.  This 
assertion has been challenged, and I thought the issue fundamental 
enough to warrant a thread of its own.

I think that root A) wears of at the end of its natural duration or B) 
wears off at some shorter point for no visible reason, presumably the 
spell has a random duration up to its maximum so its not reliable or C) 
is broken by DD of some sort, which gives the victim an additional 
resist check to see if they break root.

DD here includes DD spells, DOTs with a DD component, Roots with a DD 
component, Stuns with a DD component, Procs that do DD or any of the above.

Specifically I believe that normal melee, with no procs, does not give 
the mob "break root" chances.  Root may break early due to reason B 
above, but not because the mob is being hit.

One way to test this would be to get a group of 5 melee, make sure they 
aren't using proc weapons, and have them attack rooted mobs with big 
slow two handers for a while (few blows, few chances to break root) and 
then with paired fast one handers (many blows, many chances to break 
root), and compare root durations.  My experience suggests that the 
average root duration will be identical in these two cases.

But I've been wrong many times in the past.
