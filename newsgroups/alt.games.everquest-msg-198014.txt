Well, first day of E3 and I went to the SOE booth.
Well, it looks like they really don't give a shit about EQ anymore.
I was not "escorted" around their box then escorted out just as fast
like everyone else, so I had plenty of time to see demos and bullshit
with the dev's about SOE.
First off ..
NO EQ...
They were showcasing only 4 games.
EQ2
EQOA The New Frontier Expansion
EQ RTS
and Planetfall.

The EQ2 Demo was fucking fantastic!!! They had a live feed from the
beta and the interaction between players and NPC was great. Saw a high
end mage and her rock pet and got a port to a city that was just
incredible. Combat was unbelievable!!! It was great to finally see a
monk "Toss" a NPC with actually Martial Art moves, also saw him block
and counter blows in a very Jet Li way, very, very cool.

EQOA looks like it's growing in player base and they are trying to
make it more of what EQ should be. ( Not my words, just the Dev on
EQOA) I also asked him why EQ wasn't being shown or why SWG was a no
show. Turns out it was Lucas' turn to show off SWG this year but since
Lucas is by appointment only I did not get a chance to check it out
yet. But as far a EQ go's he basically said, " Well..were kind a only
showing games that are getting increased development, We just gave EQ
two expansions and were not really working on anything for it at the
moment." my reply, " Just patches heh", Dev laughs " Yeah patches"
smile. 
And before anybody jumps on me, no this is not a doomsday post. They
know EQ is a cash cow and they'll milk it until they can't milk it any
more and that does not look like the very near future.

EQ RTS...well lets just say the guys running the demo were very
lonely. 

PlanetFall did look very nice and it was getting attention, but I'm
not into Sci-Fi MMORPG's so, nuf said.

The game that really blew me away was EA's MOH Rising Sun. That Puppy
got a round of applause from everyone in the place.
