Whether he's saying that or not, there are an awful lot of players
who behave as if they believe it to be true.  This has been true for
years, and it isn't just Enchanters that all the morons try to jam
into some tiny little pigeon-hole.  Ask a Bard about grouping and
mana song.  Or consider the ever popular belief (recently stated
once again in this group by some idiot or other) that "all Wizards
are good for is ports and evec".  Or the amazement people express
when they discover how well things can go in a group with a well
played Druid, Paladin, or Shadow Knight in it (of course, some won't
get it, they'll tell their friends "XXXXX is easy, we did it with
just a Druid for a healer", as they lead them to their doom).

Here's a scary thought:  consider how unimpressive the "average"
EQer's game knowledge and skill are... now think about the half of
the player population that is below average.  [For extra credit,
try to avoid a migraine contemplating the 2 boxers mucking about in
the bottom 25%.]
