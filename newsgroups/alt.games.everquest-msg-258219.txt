The website traces back to Yahoo, at least that's what pasting it into
Spamcop's box says. Considering the questionable legality of the
material that's being sold on the site (copyright and/or trademark
issues possible, as well as instructions on hacking a commercial
service), I imagine Yahoo would take exception to a page selling this
guide being hosted on their service...
