Manufacturer's Description
The expansion pack EverQuest: The Planes of Power will introduce EverQuest
players to an arching story line through the Planes of Power, home of the
gods of Norrath. Hundreds of new items, quests, and encounters will keep
even the most revered players challenged and enthralled.

In The Planes of Power, a portal has been unveiled that leads to a world
unlike anything anyone has ever seen. Players can share in the knowledge of
this extraordinary discovery as they fight to bring justice to Norrath.
Veteran players will face fresh challenges in each of the 18 newly
discovered planes, while novice players will benefit from the Plane of
Knowledge that hosts scores of new and challenging quests along with open
portals to Norrath, making travel faster and easier than ever. Players will
fiercely battle the minions of Rallos Zek in the Plane of War, join arms
with Karana to regain control of the Plane of Storms, and overcome vile
pestilence in the Plane of Disease.
