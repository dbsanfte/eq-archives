Faned,
Having been in an AOE group many times - both as wizard and enchanter - I
will gladly take a spare cleric.  I've been in a perfectly adequate AOE
group with two clerics, two druids, an enchanter, and a paladin.  No
wizards, no mages, and everything worked just fine.  So please, exclude
clerics from your groups, AOE and otherwise, as often as you like - more for
me.
