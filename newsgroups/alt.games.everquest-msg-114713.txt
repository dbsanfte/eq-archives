I had a roleplaying beggar hit me up on the FV server Saturday. He
stayed in character for the most part, but refused to take "no" for an
answer. He also called me "rude" and expressed the hope that I would
some day be "poor" and know what it is like. I am a level 15 Barbarian
Beastlord (untwinked and unguilded). I think I have a pretty good idea
of what "poor" is like in EQ. After the encounter I made it a point to
give a couple of gold pieces and a couple of pieces of patchwork armor
to the next lowbie I found that RP'd and didn't ask for my assistance.
