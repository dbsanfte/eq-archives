Well, I was going to say that that goes without saying, then remembered what I that
would imply.  I suppose that there are plenty of people who are immature enough not
to realized that, or care very much if they do.  Makes me wonder if there there are
people who play nice on their "own" server, then go blow off some steam by a  prick
on another.  I suppose that Test would be a prime target of these weekend wankers,
since they could also  check out new features as the do so.  But then, the low
population of test might make this less tempting, too.    One question, do players
from "proddie" servers really tell test native that they shouldn't play there as
their main?  And if so, why?  The risk of a wipe seems pretty low, the population is
low so the soloing is good (if you're into that) and fact that it's a little bit
harder to get into keeps the lowest IQ members away.  And you get to check out new
features from time to time.  I don't like it better than FV, but it's a hell of of
lot better than the other servers I've spent time on.
