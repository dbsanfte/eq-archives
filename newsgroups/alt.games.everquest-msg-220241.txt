PoP

LDoN would be second assuming you are at least level 20 and are
willing to group with random assortments of people.  The beauty
of LDoN is that there is no longer any need to seek out new
places to level, the dungeons themselves level up with you as you
go.

LoY is a nice expansion with loads of fun and profitable things
to do, but to get any real use out of it you need to be at least
30 and either good at talking people into going places with you
or good at soloing (and probably at least 35), because few people
-do- go there, its off the beaten path and a lot of people don't
even have the expansion.  Nicest thing about it for most EQ
players is the map system, which you can try out in any starting
city or newbie zones; if you like it it might be worth shelling
out the little bit of cash to get it.

PoP seems like the least useful, since you need to be 46+ to get
in and in most cases 50+ to actually do anything worthwhile...
but that leaves out the PoKnowledge, which gives you easy travel
to every starting city as well as most of the rest of the game
world (s), and is therefore a common meeting grounds for people
to go just about anywhere.

Plus, unless you switch characters whenever you start to get up
there in levels, you'll end up spending most of your gaming life
in your 50s and 60s... heck, its clear a lot of people will spend
more time at 65 than at any other level.  So in a way, its the
higher level content that really matters.
