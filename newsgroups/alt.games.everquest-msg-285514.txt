Good lord why?  More lag, more annoyance, and honestly who cares about 
the commonlands anymore?  Glad they waited till after progression moved 
past this, the new freeports and new NRo/SRo were annoying enough.

One of the best exp zones in the low end game, did this really need Hot 
Zone status?  Everone was already heading here or Paladul.
> 25 Unrest
Now here's a zone that can use some love... and the timing is great as 
I'm busily trying to level up my new Shaman/Mage duo with my son, who's 
been playing for years but has never had his own account... nor ever 
gotten past 20th.
> 30 Tower of Frozen Shadow
Does this place really support multiple groups?  I can't see it as a 
good pick for hot zone, although I guess getting more love for an 
overlooked zone is nice.  I'd have gone with CC for this level range, 
you can really pack a lot of people in there.

> 35 Lower Guk

Ah, the nostaligia of people packed in here, screaming over spawns, 
trains wiping the bedroom group... wonderful move for Progression, where 
people want to see the old game as it was, although maybe a bit late as 
there aren't many people still this low level, even on Combine.

> 40 The Hole
40?  Did they un-revamp?  The new Hole isn't really a 40 zone, although 
they didn't bump it up to 65 like they did Splitpaw.

> 45 Chardok

Its just cruel to make one of the hot zones one were a lot of people 
won't want to fight due to faction... or will later regret having done 
so.  I didn't like the previous descision to make KC a hot zone for the 
same reason.  Good zone otherwise, though, lots of room for multiple groups.

> 50 Sebilis
Always glad to see this one on the list, recently its been 
underpopulated on Combine simply because there are zones with much 
better exp.  Should see a resurgence, heck, I can probably get Juggs 
groups even with 65's in them, if the exp is good enough.

> 55 Grieg's End
This zone was already packed on Combine, as its some of the best exp you 
can get due to the fact that the mobs die fast and the ZEM is high.  Hot 
Zone it, there may not be any mobs alive to kill; exp rate in there 
might actually DROP rather than go up!

> 60 Cazic Thule
Good news for smiths, should increase the amount of Tae Eww components 
coming out of there.  I haven't really been back since they revamped it 
on Combine, probably will be able to get groups for it now though.

> 65 Splitpaw
Frankly, on Combine this zone kicks the buttocks of all but the really 
top end people, the guys who are in the couple guilds that are deep into 
POP.  It says 65 on the lable, but I think thats 65 in gear much better 
than most people have a month after POP release.


> - Changed most of the gems in the game to stack to 100.
Which will come as a real shock to people used to buying a gem by 
holding down the shift key... I bought some stack of 100 bat wings along 
with stack of 100 fresh fish a while back, so I had 5 times as many 
wings as I'd wanted.  Wing expense is pretty trivial, but accidentally 
buy 100 Peridot instead of the 20 you meant to buy, that could be a 
noticable Oops.

Hadn't got this, in fact I'd noticed I could frequently cast a spell 
significant fractions of a second faster by spamming it near refresh 
time instead of waiting for the gem to actually refresh.

Well thats good and bad.  I actually liked being able to tell someone if 
they were successfully hiding.  I wonder if they'll show up with their 
names in parens if invis now.  Hey, maybe I'll show up name in parens. 
That would be great, I'd really like to be able to tell when I've 
managed to Hide while lying FD, and the only way to do so currently is 
to have someone else look at me and tell me.

They mess with these spells so often I'm never sure whats going to 
happen with them.  Still, its a big deal, for some rangers arrows are a 
big part of their characters, and I know for magicians bolts are often 
far better spells than their other nukes... but not during the periods 
where their pathing means they often don't land.
> - Metal Bits now stack more efficiently.
Remember when they didn't stack at all?  Now let us make stacks of 20 or 
100 with a single button press, when they are deeply trivial anyway, and 
we'll talk.

Oh, a bone to the Progression peeps!  By the way, luclin release was a 
long time ago on both progression servers, so this wording is odd unless 
they're planning to open another progression server in the future.

Which would be nice, if they change some of the way the current ones 
were implemented.
