If someone harass people bad enough i report them, and im normaly VERY tolerant
with the usual jerks. But if youre stupid enought to start calling the person you
need help from names its solely your own fault.
Try to think for a minute, what happens if you tell a druid that hesa retard if he
dont give you a sow and buff you up right now? Right, youll be on his ignore list.
Of course a guide that are there to HELP people dont like being harassed either,
and if you just try to waste his time and harass him you do not only bother they
guide, but also all the other players that need help, and increase the waiting time
after you petition.
