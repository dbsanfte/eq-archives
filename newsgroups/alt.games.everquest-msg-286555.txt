Professions
A male assassin
A female ritualistGuild Wars Factions adds two new character classes
to the game.
The Assassin is a master at getting in quickly, striking and getting
back out just as quick. They are able to instantly teleport to their
target's location using their ability to Shadow Step. They are capable
of dealing a great deal of damage to a particular target, especially
spellcasters, in a very short amount of time. This is offset by their
weak armor, making them relatively ineffective frontline fighters.
The Ritualist uses bound spirits, weapon spells and ashes of the dead
to do damage to enemies and protect themselves and their allies.
