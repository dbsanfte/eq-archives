My EQ acct is on the credit card acct. I bought a copy of the basic EQ game
from www.chipsbits.com for my brothers. They are 16 years old, so they will
have to use the game cards.  I was going to buy them a card to get the acct
started.  Is 29.95 the price everywhere? Is there somewhere to buy the cards
cheaper online?
