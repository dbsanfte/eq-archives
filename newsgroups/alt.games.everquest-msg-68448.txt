I had the same experience.  My wife's character was running around with something
like "Uber-SoW", and I seemed to be moving slower than normal (maybe it's that I was
just jealous).

The only thing that occurred to me later is that I was experimenting with the bard
song Selo's Consonant Chain and cast it on myself.  However it wore off quickly, but I'm
thinking that somehow the slowing affect might have stuck permanently.

After casting it, I met a high-level druid on an expensive horse in FV docks....  we decided
to try a race with me drumming away on Selo's, and him on his horse.  There was no competition!
If we had raced around the docks, he would have lapped me three times for every one of mine, I think.

So something's either broken, or those horses are like lightning!
