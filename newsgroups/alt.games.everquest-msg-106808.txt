Bah, bards don't require that much manual dexterity, they just require
more than any other class in EQ.  Hotkeys are your friend.....

You would be amazed at what consitutes a good bard at that level.  One
who can sing haste and either regen or clarity and do some melee
damage.  That's all you really have to do.  Point yourself at the mob,
hit attack, and sing two songs.  You can do more, but at this point
you're doing enough that the group will want you to stay.

Soloing a bard is generally a 3 song proposition, unless you charm
kite.  Worry about that in a couple more levels.  You need to learn
how to do a simple 3 song twist.  It's easier than you think, and once
you get it set up, you'll be amazed at how little work it is.
Create 8 hotkeys, labeled them Song1 through Song8.  Each one should
have the following lines on them:
/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast X 

where X is 1 through 8.  

Select a hotkey bank and put those hotkeys in slots 1 through 8.  

Hit the Song1 hotkey in slot 1.  Does it pause a bit, then a song
starts?  See the casting bar up near the top of the screen, slightly
left of center?  Watch that, when it goes away hit the Song2 hotkey in
slot 2.  Your first song should end, a quick pause, then song 2 should
start, and you should see the little casting bar.  Now do the Song3
hotkey, then back to Song1.  
You may have to change the /pause 3 to /pause 4 or /pause 5 even, but
once you get it set up, it all becomes simple.  No more timing the
lag, just hit the next song when the casting bar is gone.  
It will become second nature, I always have my left hand over the
number keys, and just have to give a quick tap, rather than a tap to
stop the song, a pause to make sure it wasn't too fast, then hit it
again to start the song.  
Again, not that this really matters, since you can be quite useful
with a two song twist.  I've just found that a 3 song twist flows
better, keeps me more focused.  Plus it's fun.

It's up to you.  You're almost to the point where bards become solo
machines.  A couple more levels and you'll learn what *real* pet work
is.  Then at 32 you get your real manasong, which is a huge downtime
reducer, though you'll have to do a twist to get healing too.  Of
course at 34 you get the nice mana/regen song, so you really don't
have to twist, though you could twist the 32 in for C2-level mana.
Then at 35 you get track, so you can simplify your life to: track blue
mob, hit blue mob, track 2nd blue mob, charm 1st blue mob, sic 1st on
2nd.  Repeat every 18 seconds until mob is dead.
  

If you can play a necro, you can play a reasonable bard.  As a necro,
you already know what kind of mobs are good to solo, and what to watch
out for.  Now you get to do nothing more than say /pet attack, sing
selos, and stay the hell out of the way.  Easy as pie.  :)
