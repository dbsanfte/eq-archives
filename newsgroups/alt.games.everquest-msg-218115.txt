My problem is more with the "lameness" than the "sameness".  LDoN
feels more like PacMan than dungeon crawling after you've been a
few times.

That is about 100% of LDoN's goodness.  And I do not object to it at
all.  It's a shame, however, that it isn't 50% of LDoN's goodness.
The absent 50% would be dungeon crawls that are more interesting than
a race to set a new "assassination" record.  The dungeons I've been
in have been full of hapless mobs that haven't the slightest chance
of even slowing down a skilled group.  Pacify pulling makes a mockery
out of rooms full of mobs, but if you want to kill fast it's better
to have a mezzer because the mobs are so gimp you don't mind having
four at a time in camp if you know what you're doing.  Add a bunch
more Enchanter mobs, some Paladin mobs set fearless so they'll LH
themselves even if you drop them under 20% fast, Wizards (and Shaman
and Druids and Mages) that cast AE nukes and rains (and set it so
the NPCs are hit by their buddies' AEs so mezzes get broken), try to
make the mobs effective fer pete's sake!  Make it a challenge, make
success something other than a foregone conclusion, make it so that
you expect to take a death or two unless you're lucky (and make sure
the xp awards measure up to that risk level, as it is if I'm not
seeing L56+ mobs I get total crap for xp, the next step down it
appears that all or nearly all of the mobs except bosses are 50 or
lower).

Well, sorta.  They've added a shiny new habitrail that I'd like a lot
better if it didn't smell so strongly of McDonald's and SuperMario.
