Oddly enough, this is one of the things I really like about it.   The pickup
group merry-go-round sucks, blows and then sucks again.  Finally get a group
able to kill something, play for 5 mintues, and then start looking for
replacements.   And looking, and looking because every time someone finally
comes and joins, another person up and leaves.

Had a "normal" pickup group in Plane of Disease the other night.   Was
excellent experience for the first half hour, even if the paladin did spend
15 minutes of it afk.   Then the enchanter said "sorry, got to go" and left,
and suddnely the druid healing wasn't cutting it.    And then his
replacement shaman took a half hour getting there, during which time the
paladin camped.   We did broken stop and go pulls until the druid ran out of
mana and had to evac, then sat at zone the rest of the time.     And then
when the shaman finally got there, the druid and beastlord annouced that
they had to leave....

Yeah, the experience was incredible when we were actually killing.   Perhaps
twice the rate of LDoN dungeon.   But over the entire amount of time spent
there, I would have gained more doing an adventure or two, since nobody
could have left.
