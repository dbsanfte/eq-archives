You're taking things out of order and out of context.  In your original
reply, you accuse me of wanting EQ for free ... even though in that same
post I said I'd accept an increase in the monthly subscription fee.

It's development costs that I'm referring to.  Once the engine, templates,
etc. are down, expanding a world only really takes graphic artists.

You haven't grouped with people that don't have all the expansions, have
you?  I have.  Heck, right now I'm one of them as I haven't bought PoP.
Sure you can play EQ without any expansion, but you'll feel miserable.
Everyone else can take off for the new lands and you're stuck where you are.
Then again, maybe on your server you have no-expansion guilds made up of
players that have none of them.

And that's my point as well.  By forcing players to buy expansions and not
simply including all expansions in the monthly subscription fees, EQ is very
possibly hurting itself.

However, all this might be a moot point.  Major advertisers are looking at
the success of the US Army's free MMORPG and many are considering doing
likewise.  In fact, a friend of mine is currently pitching such an idea to
major advertisers and has asked me to come onboard if he gets the go-ahead.
And he's said he knows others are doing exactly what he's doing.  Time will
tell.
