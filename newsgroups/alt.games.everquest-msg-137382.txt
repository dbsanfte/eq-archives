I did.  You refuse to reply once it becomes hard to defend you
position.

If you feel you can invalidate one of my points, do so, stop avoiding
them.   So far you have avoided the following issues:


1) You can no longer justify your stupid claim that " open
homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or so" and
therefore dropped the topic like a hot potato, and

2) You made a statement that the first article you linked to somehow
proved that some imaginary "homosexual lifestyle" was being forced on
"everyone".  I made nine statements to the contrary, you had no
rebuttal for any of them.  You then jettisoned that angle to link to a
second news article.

3) You ignored my challenge to prove your statement that I was forcing
my so-called homosexual lifestyle on anyone.   YOUR words: " All
anyone has seen is your militant attitude about forcing your lifestyle
on everyone else... "

4) You are failing to provide this policy you say Big Brothers-Big
Sisters of America Inc. has.  If such a policy exists, it should be
easy for you to provide the exact text and/or a link.   Then you need
to show how the existence of such would somehow invalidate what you
imagine my position to be.

If you want to claim that you have answered any of these points, then
you should be able to give direct quotes of your replies!
