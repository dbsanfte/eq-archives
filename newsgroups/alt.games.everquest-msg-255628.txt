Honestly, do you really think he meant *all* casual players are whiney 
powergamers? I am also what you might call a casual player. I put in a lot 
of time, but don't generally dedicate large blocks of it. Even still, I 
agree with him here for the most part.

You basically told him he was off the mark and then proceeded to support 
each of his points.
