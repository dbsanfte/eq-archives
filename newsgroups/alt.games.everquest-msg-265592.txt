Heh.  Charisma is a hard stat to raise for warriors. ; p  I'll probably go
for it before the resists even.

I bought it, but I find it decidedly less useful.  It would work great if
they *used* it... but the type of person that always gets lost (Invariably
the cleric :P) is almost always incapable of figuring out how to use Find
Path to PC, even with the rest of the group explaining it to them.

Regen is always nice, but it fades into insignificance at higher levels.
Considering the time between CH's is probably 3 to 4 ticks, (18 - 24 sec)
even max leadership AA is only 9 to 12 hp added to my max.

I haven't purchased this one yet.  It really doesn't seem worth it to me.
I do have a question about it though... what does the second level do?
I've seen the first level used, which just reports a list of buff names.

Best leadership AA.   I find it absolutely invaluable.

Last ones I'll purchase, if I get around to them.  I've never seen a
situation where they were actually useful.

5 percent more melee damage for the entire group?  Sounds damn nice to me.

Lance mentioned Spell Awareness.    I really like that one.   When it's on,
I have a ton more information about what is actually going on.   I can tell
who is casting what spell that is getting aggro, if the aggro is going to be
recurring (because it's coming from DoT's), what heals are coming and when.

More max hit points are always important.  100 extra just for being leader
is big.

HoTT and Spell Awareness are great.   All the rest I can take or leave, but
going back to playing without those two is torture.
