Hey! Suineko has a FBSS, a fungi tunic and a very nice 2h hammer to
melee with thankyousoverymuch!

Sui, who hasnt quite adjusted to not being a ranger yet ;)

Suiddaru Fallenstar, 57 ranger
Suineko Jamming, 21 druid (Mana? What ma... ohhhh yeah.... No, I ran
out ages ago.)

Oh, and Greater wolf form adds a *significant* atk bonus, its very
nice for the meleeists that can get access to it, even discounting
the speed and faction advantages it can bring.
