Sort of, not even close, and possibly.  SoW was available at L9 to
Shamans and L14 to Druids from the beginning so it's not very
comparable to a L60 buff.  Clarity, available at L29 to Enchanters,
was highly desired by <some> casters, but again not in the same way
as KEI.  KEI lasts for 2-1/2 <hours>, substantially deepening your
mana pool while giving twice the mana regen boost of Clarity.  Even
without the Nexus (and now PoK ports) KEI would have had the same
impact on the Kunark and pre-Kunark game, i.e. a huge fraction of
the caster population refusing to hunt without it.  There has been
no comparable impact on the game from any other buff.

For a caster KEI is completely unique, the only thing that could
replace it would be an upgraded version of KEI with a duration as
long or longer.  If KEI had a more normal duration (say 40 minutes
or so) and there was an extended duration (i.e. over 2 hours)
Clarity with an effect identical to Clarity's the extended duration
Clarity would have the same high level of demand that KEI does now.
It's the extreme duration that gives KEI its impact on the game.
If Aegolism lasted 2-1/2 hours instead of 90(?) minutes, it would
attract a similar, though much less fanatic, following among melees.
OTOH, a 2-1/2 hour duration buff that added 400 HP and gave 15/tick
HP regen and +25 STA/STR (i.e. effects comparable to KEI's, but
aimed at melees instead) would have the the same effect on melees
and Necros that KEI does on casters.  The non-existence of Kaev's
Extraordinary Vigor is just another example of the "casters, casters,

uber alles" mentality of EQ.
