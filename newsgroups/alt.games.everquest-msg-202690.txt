One simple answer:  Some, if not MOST groups *REQUIRED* casters to have KEI
and more often than not, when KEI ran out, the group would STOP so who's
ever ran out could go get some.  I've seen groups BREAK UP because...get
this....THE FUCKING PALADIN lost KEI.  The fucking PALADIN.  you tell me how
that wasn't affecting game play.  when a PALADIN *requires* KEI to fight,
that is a serious FUBAR.

I'm 50/50 on the issue.  I've been through the grind, and I know the basic
skills.  I cut my teeth on EQ waaay back in march of 1999 when it was
released.  I did the stare at spellbook 90% of the time i was logged in. I
was THRILLED when they removed that requirement....even if I dinged 35 the
following day it was removed.  I liked the reduced downtime, but then I
already had learned how to manage my mana. glad I play a melee now instead
of a caster though.  been a couple weeks since I ran out and got KEI (well,
got it the other night on my shaman because I felt like it, but I certainly
didn't *need* it.

Pickup groups just got a LOT more dangerous though.
