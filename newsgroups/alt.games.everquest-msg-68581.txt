  My dial up speed shows 56 to 55k Bps and only drops off if I log into EQ the
reload of the of my computer was to get away from luclin..that did not work EQ
would remind me that that My logon use to have Luclin and still kill off my
bandwithth at this point I am going to get a modem from a my Chief and see
useing a dif modem will work. if the Navy had not put 3 States away from Home I
do not think it would be a problem. At least I have a Computer to use.
