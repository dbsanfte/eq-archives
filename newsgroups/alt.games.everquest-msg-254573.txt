As an aside, I seem to recall that the invis (or at least my druid's camo)
timer has 3 possible durations, chosen randomly - 20 seconds, 2 minutes, 20
minutes. If I was going to need my invis to absolutely stay up, I'd wait 2
minutes. If it was still up after that, I knew I'd be good for another 18
minutes.
