That doesn't answer his entire question, however.  He was also
wondering about what the pre-51 skill caps were, as opposed to
the post-50 skill caps (which is all that eq.castersrealm.com lists).

It sure would be handy to have such a list (ideally, broken down by
level, not just pre/post-50), especially since most sites that
bother to list skill caps at all have a lot of WRONG entries
(including eq.castersrealm, which for example lists a max of
200 for a Paladin's Bind Wound skill, and my Paladin's BW skill
is already at 202...)
