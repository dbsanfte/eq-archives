In combat, click off attack, then Hide.  If anyone else is on the hate list and
you succede, the mob will turn to attack them.  This is called Evading.
Normal practice is to wait for BS to come up, then Evade, manuever
behind the mob, backstab, and reengage attack.  Its also possible to
use Evade just after a backstab, in order to ditch the almost inevitable
aggro, instead; this lets you keep the mob attacking your tank full
time instead of only taking a swipe at him just before you stab him
in the bank and then coming back at you.

You can pick pockets on any mob, what you get is something that it carries.
If you are planning to kill the mob anyway, picking its pockets is either
a waste of time, or larcenous on your part (the latter if you don't tell your
group mates about your share of the loot)  On the other hand, successfully
swiping things like the Koalind Fish would seem like a clever way around
faction hits...
