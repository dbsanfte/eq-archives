You'll likely want to try The Grey (assuming you either have an EB item
or really trust your EB spell.)  Good level for you. You can hunt
outside the Mons Letalis zone area and pull golems and snakes to the
zone wall and root rot them there. I've yet to have a mob resist Fetter
or any snare more than once and they seem to run the full time. Very low
MR to that sort of stuff, though my wife's necro reported they are very
high in resists to disease and poison for some reason. (At least the
snakes are.) 

Oh, just don't pull the shimmering rock fiends that hang out there. They
are "immune to changes in speed" and are faster than a cheetah.
