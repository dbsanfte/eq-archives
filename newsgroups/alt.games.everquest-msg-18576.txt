I can't remember the name or the class of the guy who did it to us, but 
someone did this to a group when I was still a fairly lowbie mage.  (Okay 
fine I still AM a ... you get what I mean - like around level 5 :) ) He 
claimed to be level 9, joined our orc hill group, then when we started 
fighting he pretended to panic, said "I'm getting us out of here!" and 
the next thing we know, we're all in Toxx.  The bastard ported us back, 
but you can imagine the panicky "WHAT THE HELL???" messages going through 
group chat.  I'm sure he got a great kick out of it.  I'm just glad he 
was at least mature enough to port us *back* after he got a good laugh.

(We found out afterwards he was a high-leveller who did this to groups 
often.)
