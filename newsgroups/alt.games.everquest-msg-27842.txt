My wife and I used to play Everquest before we moved to a house out in the
country with a terrible internet connection. (Old phone lines) Now, we're
moving into an area with DSL (Hooray!) but we'll only have 1 dynamic IP
address which we can share on our 2 computers.

Will Everquest allow us to play with only 1 public IP address but with 2
separate computers and games?

Thanks!

John
