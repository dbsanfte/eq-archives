There is no exp bonus for being human.  There is a lot of evidence to
suggest there was supposed to be one, but it accidentally went to halflings
instead.  Thus, you have a race that has substandard starting stats and the
disadvantage of night blindness and regular exp rates, and then you have
another race with several advantages, nice stats (for some classes) and a
healthy exp bonus to boot.  Why this wasn't changed when it was realized is
beyond me.  Sadly, halflings can't be necros, not that their stats are well
designed for the class anyway.
