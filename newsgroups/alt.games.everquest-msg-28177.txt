This surprises me, it really does.
The only thing I can think of is maybe the Guide you had actually had a
thing for you or your partner and was jealous or perhaps a previous partner
of your current man and new that he was nothing but trouble, deciding it was
better to save you from the all pain and aggravation he will cause you.

I come to this conclusion because I have often "heard" it stated in /shout
or /ooc that GM's/Guides are gay.

If this is a troll I'd say it's the best yet.

I must ask, are either or both of you Half Elf Bards?
