Was doing an LDoN today... a hard. Monk went off ahead to pull, gets 
some aggro, fails his FD, gets charmed... and then suddenly 4 mobs (and 
our still-charmed groupmate) come racing into camp to wreak some 
significant havoc. Charm wears off, Monk dies....Interestingly the 
enchanter that charmed him never aggros group.

OK. That was weird!

Twenty minutes later we're fighting another caster, who fears me, and i 
proceed to run three rooms deeper into the dungeon. When it finally 
wears off I'm immediately dazzled for another few minutes.

Group meanwhile has finsished enchanter, regrouped, and single pulled a 
skeleton to work on. I plan to FD at the earliest opportunity, and 
rejoin them when they fight they're way in to me.

Dazzle wears off I hit FD, but get interrupted (I'm in a room with 3 
mobs), and now I get charmed... and suddenly I'm tearing off towards my 
group... charm wears, I've got a swarm on me (8-9 mobs). I die FAST.

15 seconds later the swarm descends on my group and shreds them.

OK. That was REALLY wierd!


I've *never* seen that sort of behaviour. Two players charmed, both 
times all mobs in the vicinity are 'auto-aggroed' on the group, and head 
towards it. Previously if you got charmed and the rest of the group was 
out-of-sight and unaggroed, you just stood around until it wore off.

The 'new' charm appears to aggro you on your former group, chain 
aggroing everyone in the area.

Anyhow we missed the win by one kill, which is even more aggravating.



Have others noticed this? Is it a bug? When did it go in? What the hell 
can you do to mitigate it. Fear/Charm is bad enough in LDoNs... but now 
it seems to nearly autowipe the group.
