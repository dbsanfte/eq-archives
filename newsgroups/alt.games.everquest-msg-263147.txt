Twinked out with regen gear, a berserker solos better than most melee 
characters up into the mid 50s; basically a regenning zerker can take 
anything DB that he can single pull and that isnt' immune to stun; bonus 
points for killing casters, who waste a -lot- of DPS on casting spells 
you interrupt before they go off.

Above 55 or so things slow down dramatically and viable targets start to 
vanish, as 55+ mobs are all immune to your stuns, and the normal model 
where mob DPS goes up faster than PC mitigation also applies.

I soloed at least half of every level except a few in the 18-24 range, 
which I think I blew thru in an afternoon grouped in PC, and while I'll 
grant you it doesn't compare to the solo classes you name, its really a 
lot better than soloing a warrior, cleric, enchanter (all classes I've 
solo'd as well) and on a par, more or less, with soloing a shaman; the 
shaman can take harder targets but the berserker's kill rate on easier 
targets is much higher.

Lets see, these were my principle stops as I recall them:

Tutorial
Everfrost (getting newbie armor drops)
Blackburrow
Crushbone
Kurns
Paladul Phlargs
Paladul Bandits in group
Paladul Bandits solo
Echo Caverns
Gunthak Beach grouped
Gunthak Beach solo
Gunthak tunnels
Dulak scouts
Dulak warehouses
Dulak ships grouped
Dulak ships solo
POJ grouped
POJ solo
Velks
POJ second floor
Chardok grouped
Chardok exit solo
Griegs Grouped
Valor Grouped
Torment Grouped

I definately did a lot of other zones on the way up, but those were my 
principle sources of exp.  The Grouped items indicate places where I 
wasn't able to effectively solo at first, but was able to group, and 
after leveling once or twice could solo.

I also did a fair number of LDoN's, but rarely found them decent exp 
compared to what I was doing... unless I was soloing in them, but that 
was never more than a few mobs, because after the first few I'd 
inevitably end up with multiples I couldn't handle.

At 58 I can still solo downstairs in POJ and chardok exit, but the exp 
rate is pretty slow, I can't yet solo Griegs and can't even tank at all 
in Torment (every other place on the list where it says group I was MT 
about half the time)

My current soloing zone is... hmm, I forget what its called, the zone 
underneath LOIO.  Veksar?  But thats such a long trip that I just as 
frequently either do POJ or just hang out and chat with folks in POK 
while LFG.

Honestly, I might have topped out on the class, because my inability to 
solo well means I stay LFG more, and at the same time I'm getting far 
far fewer invites; under 50 I could get a group in 10 minutes or less 
almost always, now I'm lucky to see an invite within two hours.  When I 
could solo, LFG didn't bother me at all, because I was busy anyway, and 
could group or not, no big deal.  Now that soloing is inconvienient and 
grouping takes forever to arrange, my interest in the class is seriously 
starting to wane.

Grage, 58 Zerker, Luclin
