Well 'slayer' is like a guild surname...   Inc <boring Prexus history>

Once upon a time Prexus was Rotations and Calendar Reservations.

Seens as this was controlled by the servers resident uber guild, it could be
argued that it wasn't fair to all guilds, and that the resident uber guild
were just doing this, because it helped them out.

1 example, a guild was interested in VP, so needed to get a lot of Trak
teeth (from the Seb dragon, trakanon), 2-4 teeth every week is a loooong and
slow process.  Added to that though, the rotation on Trakanon was about 25
guilds long, so (taking server crashes and patches into consideration) you
could expect 2-4 trak teeth every *20 weeks* or so.

At the same time, people asked why First Brood dragons werent on a rotation
(a similar deal with Trakanon, they drop keys for Sleepers Tomb).  The
resident uber guild (and rotation moderators) said basically.. "if we rotate
first brood dragons, it will take each guild too long to have enough keys to
launch a raid"  (and that differs from VP because???)

So basically the answer was, the uber guild was done pharming Trakanon.. and
put him up on rotation for everybody else to fight over.  they still wanted
to pharm first broods though, so you tell me who was the greedy party in the
events that unfolded?

A guild called Stasis went into PoH in-between a scheduled raid (you got 1
plane raid (Pof and PoH) per month, for a 24hour period.)

They had 1 group port up real early on (its arguable how it would have
effected any other guild raid, or even if it as a big deal) and that group
stayed up about 45mins or so.

Anyway as a "punishment" for this evil dastardly deed, Stasis got suspended
from the rotations and calendar for TWO months.  (another guild who FCFS'd
Cazic - a *much* longer spawn, receieved "a warning" lol)

They were active speakers against the rotations (stasis were prevented from
joining rotations for a loooong time, in the same way some other more recent
guilds were - so much for 'fair rotations' huh?) anyway added to their
obvious being pissed off, and their already public feelings against
Rotations (corruptness etc etc), they decided to FCFS VS the next time he
popped (they gave all the loot to the scheduled raid guild anyway...)

They got really really flamed on the server messageboards for that, and
after enough abuse, the guild leader said "Ok were now fully FCFS"  (most
other servers were FCFS for a long long time before Stasis FCFS'd VS on
prexus to make a point)

Most cases they gave the loot to other people (they didnt have a need for
trak loot, they just wanted Trak teeth so they could raid VP), 1 time after
they killed Trak, they succored to the zoneline and random_paladin01 who
zoned in, was given a deepwater BP in trade, for free by the guild leader
(he didnt know the Paladin... nobody did)

The message boards were full of anti-Stasis messages (how greedy they were,
rude, thieves, dishonest, etc etc)  "Sanctions" were placed on Stasis by
certain guilds (no groups, no rezzes, no ports) which was kinda funny.. cuz
most Stasis didn't care, and would still rez random_deadpeople.

After a few FCFS's of Trak and VS, another guild declared they were leaving
the rotations and now FCFS too.   Before long another guild left the
rotations and became FCFS.

Eventually the resident uber-guild decided to scrap all rotations.. people
cried how Stasis had destroyed Prexus (well to be fair, unbiased people
argued for and against Stasis).. the guild leader (whos surname used to be
GiantSlayer) changed his name to RotationSlayer... i guess sticking 2
fingers up at all the flames and insults on the messageboards.

Some more guildiers got the surname 'Rotationslayer'.. and it became like a
"stasis" thing.

Anyway with the "slayer" bit told.. we come to your original question :)

Prexus suffered a serious crash and was out of action for several days over
a week or so period.. at first when it happened (nobody knew why) a lot of
people were in the chat.. bored.. frustrated.. passing time etc.

A guildie said to me.. "hey meem i hear the server crashed cuz you were
foraging Cloaks of Flames".. anyway chinese whispers came into play here,
and before you knew it, our server messageboard (which still has a lot of
anti-stasis posts) was filled with "PDF HACKED PREXUS!!!!"  (PDF is what
Stasis are now known as)

There was post after post about how I had performed <insert various hack>,
how PDF was crashing the server so they could re-pop mobs (like nToV, King
Tormax etc).. we were amused at first, the gullability of some people really
was pathetic.

A gm goofed up too, which was really funny lol.  He said in the main chat
room.. "I have heard of a lot of rumours that PDF has hacked Prexus. This IS
the case"  (of course he meant to say "This IS NOT the case")...  that
screen shot got posted on the messageboards, stupid n00bs started more
rumours and stories

Some guildies said to me (I had never had a surname on my monk in 60
levels).. you should call yourself Serverslayer.. and so I did.

The history of Stasis/the servers reaction is long and complicated... I
joined a long time after they went FCFS (my previous guild did raid with
them though, before and after the FCFS stuffs), so I don't really have the
"shitty rep" that some of the guild do...

It was interesting how people let "evil PDF" thoughts change their view
though..  I was known as somebody who would always go out of their way to
help <anybody>.. I pulled raids for a ton of guilds, some with friends in,
many just total strangers.. but now i was <insert random greedy asshole
insult> because my guild didn't agree in rotations (its also worth adding,
90% of our targets then.. and 100% of them now, are Velious mobs that have
*always* been FCFS)

I was helping a small guild with a real bad PoF c.r (me and the guild leader
went back a loooong time), and I managed to find a few guildies to help me
with the C.R.  (It was really really bad.. 45+ people had got wiped out all
over PoF during the breakin, and almost all of them had used up all their
rez time)

Some stupid ungrateful pricks seemed to think 1 and a half groups of PDF was
actually coming to "steal the Demis" rather then help with the C.R  (when
your an NToV/Dain/Yeli guild, I really cant think of much use of PoF demi
items to be honest..)

I had made 2 high level groups (59 and 60) for the breakin.. reason being
59+ would have a tiny agro range, and 2 groups could easily deal with any
mobs that did agro).. anyway those over-imaginative dicks decided to come
train us (1 was level 48 or so, so easily agrod half the god damn zone)..
anyway they wiped out most of my "c.r" raid (some of the FD classes eat
death touches after they stood back up, which made it even more fun)

The original guild had tried a bunker break-in (impossible to C.R there) so
we had to move every single corpse to the nwall safe spot (which was now 60
or so bodies...), really really slow, as Death Touches at this point would
have been critical...

In the end there were 2 people left alive (2 monks), and a guildie monk I'd
asked for help was on way (he had a rez stick) by the time we had moved all
the bodies, and killed a few wanderers (its sad when you think 2 monks can
kill something that wipes half a lowbie raid heh), a lot of my C.R team now
had unrezzable corpses too...

8 hours later, the raid was finally all c.r'd.. and to think, all of that
was caused by a few selfish pricks with bs grievances against PDF (these
people had NEVER been hard done by, by PDF.. they were just following the
messageboards popular view, like the little sheep that they are)

Sometimes i swear EQ (or at least prexus) is 99% politics, and 1% actual
gaming
