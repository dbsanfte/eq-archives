Ewwwww, a troll has agreed to marry a BARBARIAN?  Gross!

Actually, starting at 3pm on the 26th I'm hosting a race from Ak'Anon to
Erudin of level 1 PvP gnomies with a grand prize of a black (blue?) diamond,
2nd prize 1500p, 3rd, 1000p.  I'm guessing that'll run a couple hours but
may last longer.  I'll try to make it though. :)

(btw, PC on the black/blue/whatever diamond...the person who donated it for
the race said it's worth about 2500p)
