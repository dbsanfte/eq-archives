then what, oh great master of wise signatures, should i put in my sig?
there's nothing about me that makes me a newbie. i've been in this game
since early december '99 (no, i haven't been playing since beta) and my
druid was created in february 2000. I'm not too informed on the higher-up
part of the game, because I just recently got to be planes-capable, but I
still know a lot about it. Newbie? I'd like to hear *why* you think I'm a
newbie .. Really, try me. And as far as being a "pathetic newbie" .. You
don't even *know* me and all of a sudden you have the knowledge to say that
I'm a newbie? Should I be so bold as to say that you're an e-Baying farmer
who started off with a level 50 necro with absolutely no clue as to how to
play the game?

If you feel justified in judging me without knowing me, then there should be
nothing wrong with me judging you without any knowledge of who you are. I've
yet to see what *you've* accomplished in the game.

It's not inappropriate. It may violate the naming rules, but it's not
inappropriate.

If it was established in the first post, then why did you ask why I didn't
report her?

"mild and inoffensive" .. Children play this game. They have parents that
will freak out over "mild and inoffensive" things. "Smoking Pot" is a bit
more than "mild" or "inoffensive" ..

> You are lacking both intelligence and consistency.

Again, judging me without knowing me. And again, I'll just say, for
argument's sake, that you are the one lacking in intelligence. Consistency I
can't say, because I doubt you've been around this NG long enough to develop
any sort of consistency.

Because you commented that I said she rocked because she rezzed me. I said
that because she took time to come and rez *40* people, not just me.

Again, you don't know me, yet you judge me and make assumptions.
"deficiencies" ? What deficiencies? You don't know who I am, what my age is,
anything. You're making stuff up as you go in hopes that I'll get mad and
flame at you, which won't happen. I agree with one comment though. I am
human. And, like above, I will use *your* philosophy (judging others and
telling them what they are without knowing them) to say that you get your
jollies off of seeing people flame at you.

I don't flame. You can ask me to try harder. You can insult me all you want,
but I will not resort to flaming. I'll just sit back and let you destroy
what little attention anyone pays to you, and I'll smile when you leave.

"another mental midget" .. Still, you don't know me and you're judging who I
am as a person. You have exactly *ZERO* valid points (except that I'm human,
but I think everyone will agree on that) in your entire post.

> This conversation is over

It's a one-sided conversation if it's over, which it isn't. And, if you're
set on the conversation being over, then I reserve the right to call you a
hypocrite if you dare reply to this post. Others will agree with me there,
you said it yourself.
