I could not agree more!! 
I could set up hot keys to yell train, however it would be rediculous
to do so because how can i possibly manage so may keys for all the
zones i run thru... I mean if im in DSP for instance there are 4 zone
outs there.. so if i just make a generic train key then i get peeps
yelling where?
then i am supposed to risk gettin killed by either autorunning while i
type or stop to say where?.. no thanks... 
If u r gonna camp at a zin.. you must expect to be trained! If u get
killed... tough titty said the kitty cause the milk don't flow...
WISE UP!!
move your camp to the left or right of the zin area so you don't pick
up agro.. how hard is that to figure out?
I really enjoy EQ and I do my best to help people out, especially new
players. One thing I always try to get across is that there are safer
areas to set up camp and places that are just plain foolish to set
up.. 
The whole point of the game is to get people to think, to stop bein
stupid, so if you are lazy enuf that u camp the zone.. well ur gonna
gget trained, what's that? what if u zoned from a bad melee and then u
pop in on the last of a train the other way? 
hehe.. LOADING...  PLEASE WAIT...
