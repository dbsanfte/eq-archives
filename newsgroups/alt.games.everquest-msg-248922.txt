I am.

LDON gives the casual player a chance for gear they'd never get 
otherwise(FT2 items, etc). It also gives people a good way to practice 
raid-type kill-move-kill-move crawling behaviors. On top of that, it's 
fairly good exp and can be a lot of fun.

Yes, it does.

At the same time, when I have 2 hours to play, I don't want to spend 1/4 of 
it running from Qeynos to Freeport again. I am glad I did it to start with, 
but now I just want to get to where I am going and start adventuring. 
Running for 20 minutes isn't an adventure- it's mindnumbing.
