Yeah, a quadding Wizard has some nice numbers.  The best pillar spell, which
is at level 57, will have a 10.46 damage/mana ratio, assuming no modifiers.
The other two pillar spells that would be used in the 50's have ratios of
9.86 and 9.85.  (And, or course, most Wizards will be specialized in
evocation, which will make the numbers better).

When fighting a single mob, Wizards are under a 4 to 1 damage/mana ratio
until level 60, when Ice Spear of Solist gives exactly 4 to 1 (again,
assuming no modifiers)

High level DOTs beat that, which is why over time the DOTers deal out
more damage than Wizards.  Wizards are great when it comes to doing damage
quickly, though...Draught of Ice, for example is 731 damage with a 3 second
casting time.  With the 2.25 recast time, that's 731 damage every 5.25
seconds, for 139.24 DPS at level 57.  (215 mana, so 3.4 mana/damage ratio).
At level 65, with Strike of Solusek, it is 2740 damage, 8 second cast, 2.25
recast, so 2740 every 10.25 seconds, or 267.3 DPS.  (640 mana, so 4.28
ratio).  Throw in AA and focus effects, and the DPS will be much higher.
