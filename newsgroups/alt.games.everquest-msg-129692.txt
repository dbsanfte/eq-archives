AEQ3:

Why do you bother with these numb nuts?

You should just put together your POV, and copy/paste it every time:

Like this:

1) Pali sympathizers feel it is ok for Palestinians to kill their own
women/children by recruiting them for homicide bombers, but get all upset
when they are killed by collateral damage.
2) Young and desperate? Why weren't they desperate when Jordan controlled
and occupied the West Bank, AKA the Palestinian territories, for 20 years,
slaughtered them, and ultimately exhiled them from Jordan? Why weren't they
bombing Jordanians then?

I challenge ANY Pali supporter or sympathizer to address the above issues.

BTW: I agree with 100% of what you say. These folks are just spitting back
the usual liberal drivel they see on TV, without much thought to it at all,
or not much research into the history of the region.
