    Once you get to the stage where focus items are dropping, it gets much
better. For example, I wouldn't dream of going in on any priest-wearable
item with a detrimental focus (affliction stuff, improved damage, or any of
the Solusek effects), or anything with HP regen. But I get cranky if I see
FT or healing foci go to non-clerics before clerics, all other factors being
equal.

    Prior to the specific foci, when all you get is HPs/AC/resists, it's
harder. Like you said, everyone needs that. You have to balance everyone's
desire to get loot with the desire to do bigger and better encounters, and
what loot awards will allow you to do those better encounters. Right now I'm
not terribly cheerful that I can't replace my weakest items (bracers)
because all elemental plate drops are going to warriors first, but I
understand why we're doing it and agree it has to be done if we're going to
progress.

    They're pretty close. You get less AC and less HP/MANA, but all the
other stats are identical. The less MANA is a bit out of place, but the less
AC and HPs is right in line with what the two classes do.
