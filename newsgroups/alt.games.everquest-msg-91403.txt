Have you compared mana usage for Moonfire and Seukor? Seukor is 320
mana, Moonfire is 450 mana. You'd be better off comparing with
Wildfire, which is the druid level 59 nuke and does 1024 dmg for 320
mana - just like Seukor but without the bolt issue.
Wildfire I can get from a vendor, Moonfire will be something I'll pick
up if I come across it and then only use against mobs that are fire
resistant but not cold resistant, and I won't spend money buying it.
Mages are the #2 nukers throughout the game, you just get to share the
position with druids when we hit level 59.
