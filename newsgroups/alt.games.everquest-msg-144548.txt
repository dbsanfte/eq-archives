Not to pick on you.... *evil grin*  but perhaps you could explain to me the
difference between "creative" tactics.. and exploiting.

2 points specificaly.. although im sure there are others (they may well
apply to bens guild too)

Note both have since been "nerfed" (or should I say.. "fixed" because they
were exploits)

You mentioned part of your AoW strat was to have 2 necros in your cheal
groups who would /duel before the pull, and then cast mind wrack on each
other.. something like a 100mana spell, which gives 300 mana to everybody in
the group

Of course the net result is endless mana.. and this "creative" tactic is
something you specifically mentioned.

Well, I put it to you that you guys exploited.. the fact the spell was fixed
shows this wasnt an intended effect of the spell.

Example 2 (Ben agreed with you on this one.. hence the "his guild may have
done the same")

Using the Mind wrack "Z axiss" exploit for your emp kills.  Similar to
above, but once the duel version of mind wrack got fixed, something
different had to be done.

The "exploit" - well mind wrack didnt check the Z axiss, so it didnt matter
if they were on the same level as you, or 10 levels below you.. as long as
they stood in the "same" place  (below you).. they could cast the spell and
the group would receive the benefits.

So how could that be exploited?  Simple, banish your necros to the mines,
where they could "wrack" away on the whole feast of undead mobs.

They could both be argued as "creative" tactics.. tho i doubt you asked a GM
if it was allowed :)  And the fact its been "fixed" shows it was a result
that wasn't intended.  Taking advantage of game bugs = bannings and
suspensions.

Do you really think LoH deserved the banning/s?  If so, shouldnt your guilds
officers (and whatother guilds exploited it) had a similar fate?

Not meant as a slur on either of your guilds (I like both of you).. but id
like clarification :)

Afteral if your so against what LoH did, James (take advantage of a flaw in
the game).. how does that differ from what was done with mind wrack?

Its not like theres an official mob pull guide, to know whats legit and
whats not..

And no, we've never used that exploit ever.  The fact we've had *one* necro
on maybe 3% of our raids in the last 2 months should show that :)

Not a flame guys.. an honest question and a curious mind
