Hmm, did you doublecheck that the CPU is running at the correct voltage, 
and is not overheating?  Those can lead to all sorts of odd behaviour that 
EQ seems abnormally sensitive to.

I think I may also have had some problem that somehow involved the onboard 
network adapter.  Turning that off in the setup made whatever problem it 
was go away.  Onboard sound was similarly more complicated than sticking 
El Cheapo Yamaha card in it.  As I recall, if I used the onboard stuff, I 
tended to get in trouble about when I installed nvidia drivers, but 
eventually managed to get it all to work at once through some tricky 
miracle.  Then I had to reinstall the drivers a month or two later, 
couldn't remember what I'd done, so I turned the onboard stuff off. :)

Now, if that doesn't work... can I have your stuff? :)
