2HS is never as good option as when the damage cap is lifted at level 20 and
your dual wield skill is still fairly low.

Therefor you may find that 2HS will outdamage 1HS a while from level 20
onwards.

When you hit level 35+ (correct me here but when running Copelands program I
came to that level conclusion) I would go back to 1HS again to maximize
damage.

In fact try keep most weapon skills maxed.

To answer your question the ultimate way would be to keep one decent weapon
of each weapon 2HB, 2HS, 1HB, 1Hs , pierce and keep skills maxed.

If you are a bit lazy and find this to time consuming then don't do 2HB,
pierce,1HB or whatever, just 2HS and 1HS.

As soon as weapon skills are maxed for your level turn to your main weapon
for that level which should be 2HS between 20 and 35(?)

There is nothing wrong with 2 lammies, a cheap 2HS with nice ratio is the
Nathsar Greatsword which you could get for just 500 pp and which has a nice
ratio plus it raises your skill fast.
