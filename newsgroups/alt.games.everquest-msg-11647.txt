Personally, I think you should have stuck with A.Moron, but to each
his own.

hmm.. lessee...

My argument:  A Shaman can tank equal to that of a ranger, rivaling a
paladin, if necessary.

Your argument:  "Guffaw"

Yeah, that's a way to defend your arguments.

My argument is supported by numerous high level monks and the people
who've grouped with them.  Your argumen is apparently supported by
blinking a lot.

What the fuck ever, just ask the high level monks that peruse the
group.  Monks can and do out tank Warriors up until the endgame.
