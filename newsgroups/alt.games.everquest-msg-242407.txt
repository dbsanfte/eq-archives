I assume anything I can buy off a vendor on FV, or sell to a vendor, is
not nodrop on a normal server.  So many everything but the sharp bloodling
mandibles.  Which, it seemed to me, they upped the drop on; I remember the
very first time I played a Vah Shir going for several levels of killing
those damned bugs without seeing ONE mandible (and I was looking for 'em
for the Ghulam Armor quest).

How does that work exactly?  And did they ever really add the thing that'd
allow people to sell bags in trader mode?  I remember hearing something
about traders getting a token or something from an NPC...

Exactly.  :)

Lord, yes.  Actually, re-reading the class description, there's a bit that 
says:

"With the mastery of his innate rage, the berserker also gains the ability to 
become "berserk," a deadly state which causes a great amount of damage as a 
berserker's blade swings with frenzy. As dangerous as berserkers are at these 
moments, they become more vulnerable to enemy attacks."

Frenzy definitely does NOT work like that.  :P  And, having been low on HP 
many times, I can say for sure that 'zerkers don't go "berserk" the way 
warriors do.  Reading over the class boards, it doesn't seem like they get 
/any/ ability to up their damage while lowering their defense.  Meh?

Right now, my snare is fairly reliable.  Not 100%, but good enough to stop or 
slow most runners.  I know they recently fixed the level 60 berserker stun to 
work on creatures up to level 65 (where it used to be limited to 55, 
*boggle*).  Don't know if the highest level snare does the same.

Looking over Lucy and the berserker websites, it seems as though the class 
gets three different types of axe-powers (along with various disciplines).  
Snares (leg crushes/slices/etc), stuns (head-smacks), and group attack/buffs 
(war cries).

Unfortunately, it seems that, right now, the war cries override other 
people's disciplines.  D'oh!  Not very useful, that... in fact, worse than 
useless.  I hope they fix that soon.  :P

Ooo, good idea.
