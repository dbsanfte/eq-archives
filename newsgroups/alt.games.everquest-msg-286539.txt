	"Software testing" doesn't mean exhaustively verifying every possible
combination of inputs and outputs.  Even when your target involves a very
complicated graphical UI it's not necessary to test for every possible
combination of keystroke and mouse click. Every program is a finite state
machine ***or can be simplifed to approximate a finite set of states for
the purpose of verification***.  For instance, to verify proper interaction
between a moving character and the geometry you don't need to test every
possible path.  A path down each axis and a path into two corners is probably
98% sufficient.  And the beauty is that even if the ONLY way to test this is
to actually have a human drive a GUI tools exist that will "record" that 
session and produce an automated test that can be run by a machine! Then
EVERY TIME someone touches the code a machine automatically makes sure that
there's at least a 98% chance that you can still move around correctly.

	There's much more at stake than downtime or flawless patches.  Whether
you believe (as I do) that these guys should spend some time fixing long-
standing playability issues like warping mobs or if you feel that they should
put out as much new content as possible there are a finite number of 
resources available.  A bug that makes it to production is orders of
magnitude (yes, orders of magnitude) more expensive to fix than a bug 
caught in unit test.  If Sony has 200 programmer units to use, they can
use them to fix 2 bugs in the production system, or they can use 100 of them
for effective QA, 50 of them to fix 10 bugs during unit test, and 50
to design new zones only 2% of the playerbase will ever see.  Which is better?

	Think of effective, scientific software QA as Lesson of the Devoted
for defect prevention.

	This isn't an isolated incident.  It's so much a part of a set
pattern that people accept it as normal behavior.  That in itself is
a serious defect (that it's part of a pattern, not that people accept it).


>To complain with such zeal about one bug in such a 

	Pattern.  I'm fruitlessly whining about Sony's observable lack of
adequate development and operational quality control.  It's a consistent
pattern, not a single bug.

>magically able to catch any and all bugs in their enormous multi-server 

	Not magic.  Just standard scientific development procedures.
And not all of them, or course.  But really, *every* time they change 
something it's broken for N weeks afterward.  That's not just bad luck.
