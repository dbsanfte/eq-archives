Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword doesn't have all the nice bonuses, but it
is cheap to buy (or easy to get at your level if you get a partner and
go to Runnyeye) and at 24/38 will outdamage Shieldstorm by quite a bit.
Arbitor's Combine Greatsword is more expensive, but not beyond the pp a
L40 could raise, and it is 30/43 15wis 25mana.
Centi Shortsword is usually pretty cheap and will outdamage Ghoulbane
by quite a bit (12/25).

Lots of choices here, Fineplate Visor is ac7 and should be purchaseable
from a player smith for 60pp or less.

Skull-shaped Barbute is same ac and gives 35hp and 10mr, worth _way_
more than the 8wis

Anything (except maybe patchwork leather :p ) is better than a Serp
Bracer.  After you upgrade a few other pieces you could solo the
Minotaur Hero to get drop for Hero Bracer quest (ac9 10str 5svp 5svd).
Fineplate bracers are ac9 and should be buyable for 50pp or so.
Scavvenger Bracer is ac9 and some stats.   lots of other choices here.

Enameled Black Chestplate (LGuk) ac25, better anytime you don't need FR.

Fineplate boots (forget exact AC), Boots of Ro

Rember that as a Paladin you're single greatest strength tanking (and
at 40 you are still close second to the Warrior).  So, except in
circumstances where resists are important (not too often, tho MR has
value in a number of xp grinds) AC is king, HP is queen, and looks/stats
are the court fool.
