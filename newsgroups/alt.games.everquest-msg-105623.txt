Silver you have to understand that for the 3 years the game has been out
EVERY time there is a patch (scheduled or not)  someone
comes into this newsgroup and posts something along the lines of:

"EQ DOWN WTF?!?!?!"
"I can't log on VERANT sucks!!"
"I keep getting error #### when I try to log on?"
"Verant needs to refund money for ALL THIS DOWNTIME!!!!"
"Why can't they bring down the servers when no one is on?"

We actually take bets on when the first moron that posts about
the servers being down on patch day.
When the post comes it generates the requisite flames.
So realize this is the environment your post jumped into.
