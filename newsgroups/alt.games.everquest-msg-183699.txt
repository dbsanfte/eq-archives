This is the kind of rare spell where research could help, but even so, take
note of this blurb from the article:

"The new research still requires components from risky locations or
dangerous foes. Our goal is to increase the number of ways to earn rare
spells, without reducing the challenge required."

So it's still not going to be a trivial process to acquire the research
components, even if you have the skill to do the combine.
