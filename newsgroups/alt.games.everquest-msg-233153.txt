an odd occurrence I get sometimes is... Ill have the maps working
fine, and use em numerous times in the same session, then one time I
bring up map, and no map there.. zoomed out still no map, zone, still
no map, log to another char, still no map.  Log all the way out,
reconnect to EQ, and maps are back.

Love the new UI, but I honestly think its rather buggy at times.
