I've been thinking about this since yesterday, and I've changed my
mind regarding the people who disrupted the Wiccan ceremony.

They are Christians - or more specifically, we can't look at this one
instance and declare that the people who participated are not
Christian simply because of this act. 

Certain it was a non-Christian act, and while that leaves a stain on
the participants, it doesn't change who they are. You don't cease to
be a Christian simply because you've sinned. Absent this particular
hateful instance they may be model Christians.

Or it may be that they are acting in a way perfectly consistent with
what they perceive the religion to be. You yourself noted that
Christianity embraces the Old Testament as well as the New, after all.

No, actually, I didn't notice that at all.

I haven't seen any evidence of that. Perhaps you can provide examples?
