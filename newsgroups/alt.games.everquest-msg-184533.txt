Skill, in my understanding, is the successful, applied use of knowledge. It
involves knowing what needs to be done in a particular circumstance, and
being able to do it.

If you know what to do, and how, but can't do it, you may be knowledgeable,
but not skilled, or at least not skilled enough. If you don't know how to do
something, then having the physical capability won't do much good unless you
depend on luck.

Only if you both know what to do and can actually do what you intend, are
you skilled in that area under consideration.

In that respect, there are many skills involved in playing Everquest at
certain levels.

Some example skills used in EQ:

Crowd Control (via spells, songs, or even simply being the one person who
fights the extra critter while the rest deal with the first.). You must know
what to do, when to do it, and be able to do this at a seconds notice based
on a number of variables, including the location, the type of monster,
relative mana and health levels, your class and level, the class and level
of your group-mates. etc. Compared to some of the rote reactions required
for many "twitch" games, this requires both knowledge, judgment as well as
reaction time.

Pulling. Yes, even the simple task of grabbing a critter to be slaughtered
requires judgment and application of knowledge. Unless you grew up in the
Lake of Ill Omens/Overthere/Dreadlands cycle where often "pullers" learn how
to pull by killing their group repeatedly in Karnors Castle... But again,
you have to balance factors such as mana/health levels, keep track of when
certain static spawns are likely to reoccur, judge the likelihood of
returning with multiple targets and balance that against the skills of your
group and their ability to crowd control, etc.

Healing. There is often an art to knowing when to heal. Heal too early and
you may draw the monster onto the healer. Heal too late and you may kill
your groupmate. Which heal do you cast? Do you wait to cast Complete Heal on
your main tank? Or is there a chance the enchanter or another low hit point
class may require a heal during that 10-second cast?

Even something as apparently simple as choosing your weapons involves SOME
skill. Do you go for maximum damage output? Maximum speed? Are you trying to
hurt the critter or just keep its attention on you? Which brings up the
skill of playing the main tank, a.k.a. "Aggro Control".

There's skill involved in organizing and running raids. Finding the correct
class and level balances, communication, etc. I've been fortunate to work
with a bard who ran 20 dragon raids in a row over a several month span, and
had only one failure. There were fights with only one or two deaths, or
none.

All in all, is Everquest a mentally challenging game? It depends on how you
play it. If you're content to sit back and do the same old stuff that you've
been told "here's how you do it", then once you've learned a certain minimum
basic knowledge and can apply it, then no, it won't be particularly
challenging.

Like so much else in life, you get out of it what you put into it.
