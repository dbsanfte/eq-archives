I'm looking for a recommendation for a place for my 35 Druid to hunt (far
too many 'for's in that sentence). I've read up on various sites and Eastern
Wastes sounds interesting. Was reading about how good it is if you group to
hunt Ulthorks from 35-41. So I would get spires to GD and run over. Is this
a good plan or will I find EW is devoid of other players?? Is there anywhere
better I could go fight. I'd prefer to group having soloed 25-35 pretty
much, just want a change for a few levels.
