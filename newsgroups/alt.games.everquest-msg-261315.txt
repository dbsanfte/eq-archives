Unlimited?  Why would it have to be unlimited?  A few kpp, not at all
difficult to acquire by 50, will outfit your L50 in gear far better
than he could possibly hunt for by 55, with a very few exceptions.

There should be usable, class restricted, NODROP gear dropping IN
LDoN missions, the AP bought stuff should befor filling gaps.  There
should be lots of level restricted content with NODROP rewards.

Oh, and one more thing... Has it not occurred to you that one of the
reasons YOU don't see so many lower level toons around is that one
of the reasons they are lower level is because they play a lot less
than you?  And yes, SOE should be paying attention to these customers
who cost them a lot less to support while paying the same fees.
