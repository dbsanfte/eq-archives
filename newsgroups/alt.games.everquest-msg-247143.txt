That is not in dispute.

Yeah.  Thats the part that I don't get.   You're not making sense here.
Sony isn't sending you to 15 random porn sites with ActiveX enabled, or
saying you have to keep it off to be a part of the beta.  You can turn your
protections right back on as soon as you're finished.  And you obviously
/didn't/ forget about it, since you remembered to come here and rant about
having to have it on for a few minutes.

It's like saying "They're making me install software!  I might becomes so
used to installing software that now I'll download stuff from random sites
and install that too without thinking about it!"
