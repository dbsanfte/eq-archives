I have mine set up as

/stand
/cast 1, /g Castin' complete heal on *** %t ***
/cast 1, /cast 1
/pause (11 seconds, don't have it in front of me, can't remember if it's set
as 11 or 110)
/sit

and it works fine. I'm 99.9% certain it does read from right to left,
though, regardless of the command used, at least from what I've read. And I
do know that my announcement to the group comes at the same time as casting
(if it's in the other order, from what I remember from early blunders, I get
the 'You can't use that command while casting' message. I could be mistaken,
but pretty sure it's right to left.)

That might not be a bad idea; usually when one cast fizzles, it goes ahead
and recasts the next with no interruption. Once or twice I've had the
situation where the spell fizzled and it didn't recast at all. Usually I
just pay attention, if it doesn't cast I'll cast it manually (since it's a
complete heal, which is cast in a life-or-death situation, usually, and
requires vigilance).
