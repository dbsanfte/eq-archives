It displayed both, I know 'cause my cleric has a shield she's too low
for with no other stats.  But the reduced AC was grey, and the standard
AC was red, so if they changed that around, it would make more sense I
guess.  Not too hard to figure out though.

Interestingly the shield actually gained AC as she leveled.  It was 18
when I got it, and it had gone up to 23 last time I checked, even though
still not at recommended level.
