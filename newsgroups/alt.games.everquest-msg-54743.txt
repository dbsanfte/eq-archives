If loot isn't a problem,

Swamp Of No Hope - Always empty on my server.  May have to hunt closer to
the Field of Bone zone than the FV zone at level 12.  Loot is terrible but
there's no competition for kills and it's nice and quiet ).

Gorge of Xorbb - Hunting muddite minors and goblin sentries near Runnyeye
Entrance.  Although more popular since RE was renovated.

Field of Bone and Kurns Tower - Not less traveled by newbie iksar but rare
are the newbies of other races in these zones in my experience.  Lots of
undead and good areas to hunt.  One of my favorites.

I can think of many other zones on my server that are almost perpetually
empty, but not suitable for level 12.  Warsliks Woods, Mistmoore, Emerald
Jungle, Dalnir, Dagnors Cauldron, Kaesora and Timorous Deep are all zones
I've been too regularly and found that Im the only person in the zone (or at
least not riding a boat as in TD).  With the possible exception of Kaesora,
you can eventually solo in all those zones for experience if careful.  I
haven't had much luck yet alone in Kaesora except with the minion who guards
the lobby ).

Just my 2 cents,

Moriarty
