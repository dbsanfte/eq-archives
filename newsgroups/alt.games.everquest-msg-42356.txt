Nope - but it's fair game for other players to pick up.
Your best bet is to give it to a friend or GUildie, log out and in
again as the other char and have them give it to you.

If you have no friends (!) or are not in a Guild, move both chars the
same place (that is not usually frequented) i.e. a room in one of the
inns in East Freeport.  Drop the stuff, log out/in and pray the bag
/plat hasn't been picked up.

Slightly off topic:  What would you do if you came accross a small
fortune in gear or plat on the ground:

One thing to do would be hold it, wait 10-15 mins, using ooc to see if
any one was missing or had dropped "something".  If they could
describe it exactly, along with where they had dropped it, then more
than likely it's theirs.

If after waiting a reasonable amount of time no one started shouting
for it, then is it "ok" to keep it?  Throwing it back on the ground
just would mean that someone else (perhaps less scrupulous) would
probably pick it up and leave.  Shouldn't you be allowed to keep it
after trying to do the decent thing?

I am not trolling, I'd like to know what you'd do:
1) Pick it up and keep it
2) Leave it alone
3) Pick it up, wait around for a reasonable time (10, 15, 30 mins) and
if no one claims it, then keep it.

Personally speaking if I came across a Wurm or several thousand plat,
I wouldn't be elven if I didn't *think* "JACKPOT" and make off with
it, but  I don't think I'd actually do it.   I might add it's never
happened to me, so I haven't had to contend with that moral dilemna.
