It is trivial for a voter to examine thier own ballot prior to
dropping it into the box to confirm that there are no "hanging chads"
and that it is punched properly. It takes all of about 5 seconds and
an IQ over 60 to pull it off. If a problem is found the voter is
allowed up to 3 attempts ("spoiling" the problem ballot) to get it
right.

The "hanging chad" is a voter problem, not a punch card problem.
