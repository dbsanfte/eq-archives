I find it helpful at low levels to tell people what my pet is attacking...
and all the more so when you consider that the player is suffering
under the mental handicap of being a five year old.  Without
tag lines like this there would be no comunication coming from
the boy at all.

I changed it to

/pet attack
/say my pet is attacking %T

and it seems to work fine.  No way on the planet I'd consider
building in a pause before the crucial attack command is
issued, if there is going to be lag built in to the button its going
to be in communicating.

Slowly he's learning some basic grouping words like RUN
and GET YOUR DAD... since this game really works better
when you can read and write he's been figuring those
talents out a lot faster, sort of like his sister when she
discovered Harry Potter.
