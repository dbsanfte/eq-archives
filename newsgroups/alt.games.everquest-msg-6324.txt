While I can certainly understand, and empathize with, your frustration,
I think you might be better served by changing your outlook on the whole
thing. Yes, it is difficult to see someone running around with all this
equipment that they didn't earn, but keep in mind that it is not a
contest. There is no way to "Win" this game, so the only one you are in
competition with is yourself. Now, if the person starts acting like an
asshole because you have "inferior" equipment, then by all means, lay
into them. But, like I said, it just may have something to do with your
outlook on the situation. Neither one is necessarily right or wrong,
just different.
