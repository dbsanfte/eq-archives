Here is what you said:

...which is only true if you fail to look up sufficiently.

Either your understanding was just plain wrong, or you failed
to supply sufficient information to give an accurate overall
description of what happens when you run out of stamina while
swimming.

: Here's a hint: You won't find one.  You will find several in which I state 
: you will FALL, which Kaev kindly confirmed.

Fall, drop, sink, lose elevation, go down, decrease in altitude.

Whatever...you're a dope.  Go swim in circles for a while, I'm sure
you'll find it a blast.

By the way, this is my last response to you - feel free to get in
the last word.
