I started a new Druid on Bertox,  ran around in Misty thicket for a couple
of hours bashing rats, etc.  just as i was getting to 5th level I was too
bold and got killed on the 'bad' side of the wall.  I ran about for a while
looking for my corpse, but it had done that sliding thing when i died and
seemed to have kept going while i was dead...so no mini Naddo's stuff.

I wasnt too bothered, logged off and came back on next night, ran the coin
quest a few times to get enough cash for a rusty mace and carried on
bashing, about half an hour later, i stumbled on the previous nights
corpse!...which was nice!

So the point of this little ramble is, that I thought that the decay time
for under level 6 was about 5 mins, I wonder if this has been changed? (man
i was gloating when i lewted my 30sp 60 cp...i am UBER!)

happy new year, (i know i am early but i have some beer that is singing a
siren song, i dont think i can hold out much longer....oooh, sweet, sweet,
beer)
