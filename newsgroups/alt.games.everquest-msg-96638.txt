Hi there,

Have been playing EQ for bout a month now, reading group bout 2 weeks.
I have a question that has been driving me round the bend, and I can wonder 
no longer:
What is 'twinking'?
I gather it has to do with gaining XP (god bless M$), but I am at a loss to 
understand exactly what it entails
Anyone able to help, an explanation would be much appreciated

Thx

Sid
