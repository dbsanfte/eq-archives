  Another nice thing about the transparent inventory screen is that it
doesn't show your character like it did when you were in 640x480 mode
before.  The problem with showing your character like that (for people
with slower computers like mine) is that it renders everything that's
BEHIND your character too, which causes performance noticeably
decrease.  True, you only get the bad performance while you have the
inventory screen up, but it's really hard to switch from 2HS to
1HS/shield to bash a caster in the middle of a fight when you're
getting 8 FPS.  For this reason I find that I usually find I can
tolerate the performance better when playing at a 800x600 than when
I'm playing at 640x480, which forces the old inventory screen on you.
