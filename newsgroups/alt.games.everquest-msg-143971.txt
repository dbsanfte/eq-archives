You have to get your pick lock skill up to 11 at the trainer's before 
it'll work :/  Then work on the door in Befallen for, oh, AGES.  :)  
When I'm super bored I'll go put 50 points into it.  Well, 25 now that 
it's around 110 or so.  It's very very VERY boring.  And since you're a 
starter rogue, go here:

www.thesafehouse.org

Best rogue website out there.  Check out the resources link for info on 
lockpicking and all the other nifty skills you get, and a heck of a lot 
more.
