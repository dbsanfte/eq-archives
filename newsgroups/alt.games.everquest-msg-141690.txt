Seem to recall the reversed the banning and issued an apology, but the
person in question decided he/she wasn't coming back anyway. The story
in question involved the rape of a minor, and some parental watchdog
found it and started bitching to Verant about it...

Just should be a general common sense rule, though... When writing a
fanfic to be posted publicly set in someone else's created world, be
sure to know the accepted boundaries of "taste"... ><
