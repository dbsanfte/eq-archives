Well...I've not been everywhere yet!  :-p

Besides, it *is* a 2 inch thick type binder.  I have room...

That being said, I do have plans to spend a day or two doing a grand
tour with my bard and checking out as many zones as I can get him to -

Emerald Jungle and whatever that zone is with the big Globe in it this
past weekend for the first time!  Realized there was a lot of cool
stuff I've not seen yet.
