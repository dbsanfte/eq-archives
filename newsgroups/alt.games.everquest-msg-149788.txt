*shrug* It's a matter of what you LET get in the way. Some people feel
they can't RP with /ooc turned on. I never understood this. If you're
good, you can seperate OOC and IC without having to totally filter out
the OOC.

Anyway....I don't understand how the graphics "get in the way" of
RPing for you. Just because the character on the screen doesn't move
for everything you emote shouldn't be a problem. *shrug* A good
roleplayer shouldn't NEED that. Do you have problems with LARPs 'cause
you can't really fire a gun? ;-)
