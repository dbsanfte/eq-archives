Sure, if no one else shows up in the meantime. The concept is
extremely subject to abuse, though.

Example - say I arrive at a camp, find no one there, and decide to
work it. Some schmuck comes along and says it's his camp, he just
stepped away for a minute to sell. Why on earth should I believe him?
As far as I'm concerned, his 'claim' is entirely unverifiable.

The *only* valid way to lay claim to a camp is to be there working the
camp. Leave it, and lose it.
