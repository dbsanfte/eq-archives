I wish i had as much whit as some other people, but I am left with what I
have, nonetheless.

I was hunting Giants in the Warslik Woods fort with my bard who was level 29
at the time.  My method for fighting was snare a giant, pull it to the "safe
spot" and then fear kite it while snared.  Well this usually goes pretty
well for me, the giants seem to hardly resist at all, but on one occasion my
snare broke and a giant trained back a friend on me.  Well the first one was
almost dead so I finished it off and then preceded on the second one.
However, the second one was resisting a lot more then usual (of course don't
they always), so i decided just to snare it run away and sit and heal with
my song.  I did this a couple of times and had gotten it to about 1/3 life
left.  I wanted to make sure I had plenty of life before the final round so
once again I snared it and went and sat down to heal.  Of course the giant
is still running at me with malice in his eyes and his life is at 1/3 when
all of a sudden i get the message "you gain experience".  I stand up look
around and there is a monk standing over the body of giant.  Before I even
get a chance to speak he /shouts "Hey that was my kill"
Me: /boggle No it wasn't I had been kiting it for some time.
Him: "That's crap I pulled it way before you did.
(at this point I check this guys level to see what I am dealing with, /who
monk_a ~ which returns 32 monk)
Me: Well i appreciate the help killing it but as you can see it was almost
dead when you started attacking it.
Him: Was not!  It had full life when I first saw it.
(now i realize this situation could be a little tricky so I am going to try
and be diplomatic)
Me:  Ok well there is an issue with EQ where if you are far away and con a
monster it will always look like it has full life, so you might want to
recheck the monsters health before attacking.
(all the while I am thinking wouldn't he notice that the monster didn't
attack him back and that it died in 2 or 3 hits?)
Him: You are an a$$hole, I hate crap bards like you who go around killing
everybody elses kills. You mother ...etc.etc.
Me: /ignore Monk_a
Me "Sorry to here about that, hopefully you have more luck Kill Stealing in
the future!"


Ok ok so i know the last part was unnecessary but man some people urk me!


I wouldn't get too upset with the monk, he did you a favor by killing it for
you.  You did loot it under his nose didn't you?  If you got xp I think you
should have gotten the loot too, I think.  The way to prove you were kiting
was by looting before he could.
