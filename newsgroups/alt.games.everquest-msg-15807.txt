I was in the best group I have found to date this past weekend. It was me, a
lv 39 monk, a lv 35 monk and a lv 42/43 shaman killing Hill Giants in Rathe
Mountains. (he dinged while we where playing) Man, I'm telling you it was
like feeding Hill Giants through a shredder. I was getting good exp, not
great as they where all blue to me, but the money was what we where after
anyway. In about 5 hours, we each made about 600pp. Double that for a full
group and the mobs would be dropping faster than you could pull them.

4 monks
2 shaman

slowed mobs, buffed up monks, can you say fast damage?
