You will not evade me, "Bill Silvey" <bxsxixlxvxexyx@cfl.rr.com>:

You and Lokari seem to be covering the rest, so I just thought I'd go
into a bit of detail on this quest problem :)

What she said: read Allakhazam's instead of Everlore. As for these two
quests: The bone chips are to be handed in to the paladin guild in
Kaladim - not in Greater Faydark at all. There is no cleric guild in
Kelethin, the closest is in Felwithe. (There is a bone chip quest
there too: hand in 4 bone chips to start a quest for Tunare
worshippers, but I think the Kaladim quest would suit you better.)
You didn't mention if you were high elf or dwarf, but I assume you're
a high elf - get a map of Greater Faydark, Butcherblock, and the two
halves of Kaladim, and follow the paths. You'll get experience, some
money or low end item, and better faction with the dwarven paladins.
If you hunt Crushbone orcs and collect their belts, those are also
handed in in Kaladim, but in the warrior guild instead.
Now, the spider silk thing with the bards - that's another faction
thing. Unless you've delivered a ton of letters for them, they just
don't trust you enough to let you hand in spiderling silks.
 
>All I can think to do at this point is to go from "room" to "room" and hail
>*everyone* until *somebody* gives me a quest *shrug*

Well, that works too :)

Greater Faydark is generally not the best area for quests. It has
nothing but a handful of bone chip/pixie dust/rusty weapon things
which don't pay off in either experience or item reward.
