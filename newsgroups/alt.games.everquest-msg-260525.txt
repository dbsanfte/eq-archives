Hi gang - I'm playing my 45 bard.

I just did a LDoN and I disarmed a chest and we beat the heck out of it.  It 
coughed up some sort of no-drop potion, however nobody could loot it - we 
all got a message saying we can't loot while an enemy is close by.  There 
were no mobs within several rooms.

Can someone explain this to me?

Thanks!

Lou
