I played a mage for 66 levels.  I've played them before for 29 levels, 
and others into their teens.  Its a fun class.

One nuisance, though, is that the air pet goes invis when he's not busy. 
  Which used to be great, back when mobs would aggro on perfectly 
innocent pets who were just wandering around lost in the pathing.

But they changed that, so pets have no faction problems.  And left the 
invis in.

Why is that a nuisance?  Well, just this; its often a good idea to give 
your pet some gear of his own, and mages are great at doing that, with 
loads of stuff they can summon for the purpose.

Unless they have an air pet, who is likely to go invis and then is hard 
to find.  Mem see invis, buff up, another step.  Or have the pet attacks 
some green mob just so it will break the invis for a minute.  A pain.

My son, playing his first mage, about an hour after I explained this to 
him, looks over at me and says "uh, dad, you can just click the invis 
buff off."

So you can.

Of course, in my defense, there didn't use to BE a buff window.  And I 
generally summon an orb of exploration so it really isn't a problem for 
me.  But still.  DUH.
