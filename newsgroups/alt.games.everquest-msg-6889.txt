If you are asking about the stat boosts on some food items now, they
don't have a timed effect.  It starts working as soon as the stat boost
item is your first accessible food item and lasts as long as that item
remains in the number one consumption position.  You don't need to
manually "eat" them for them to work.  I've got a stack of pickled
wyvern or some such I carry at the bottom of my supplies and move up to
the top spot when I'm hunting WL mercs since I need any and all sv vs
magic I can get when fighting them.  I don't use them unless I'm
actively in combat so as not to waste them, though they were in fact
easy to make for me, just being frugal.  This way of using them only
when needed would be a good plan for anyone purchasing them rather than
making their own for certain and can't hurt even for master bakers.
