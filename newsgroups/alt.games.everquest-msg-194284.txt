I think Patrick had a great idea when he suggested giving druids a disease
based slow line like Shaman have. Id say make it come a few levels later
than the shaman, and be 5% LESS efective and youd have a balanced solution.

Mind you balanced on only 2 Serves. Vallon Zek, and Tallon Zek. Also, fixes
like this are not without precedent. The Diety based PvP server ( Sullon Zek
I think? ) has somthing similar. The good team has no way to summon corpses,
so mages were given a spell that they can quest for that allows them to
summon corpses. Its expensive, and takes a lot of mana  ( From what I hear,
dont know first hand ), but it does address the issue of the good team not
being able to summon corpses after a total wipe.
