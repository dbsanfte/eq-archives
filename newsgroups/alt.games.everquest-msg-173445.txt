PotG does not have a regen component.  PotG, and PotC, give clarity 1,
but no regen.

Skin Like Nature gives two points of regen per tick and Natureskin
gives four.

Only SLN is castable on anybody under level 45 though.

Cast SLN, Chloro, and Sheild of Thorns on a level 1 though, and they
will be at least level three before Chloro runs out.

Especially considering that up to level nine or ten, the main method
of killing is still gonna be melee regardless of class.
