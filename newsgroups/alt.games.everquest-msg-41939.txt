If that was your point then you didn't express it very well.  My post,
which you quoted part of, was advocating extreme punishment to the
mastermind of the attack; i.e., one man.  There was nothing in my post
about indiscriminate bombing of Afghanistan.  Try to read more
carefully and not simply have a knee-jerk response to language you
don't care for.

I do advocate death to bin Laden.  Death to the members of al-Qaeda.
There are no "innocent people" in bin Laden's training camps.

I advocate the removal of the Taliban from power.

I do not advocate the indiscriminate bombing of the Afghani people.
