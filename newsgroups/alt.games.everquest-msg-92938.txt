Bone chips, 3 and 4 done. 
Many people forget the East freeport dismal rage bone chip quest
in the sewer with xelha, where only a few characters are KOS. I think
only high elves and wood elves are kos, especially if a class with a
god. Shamans of the tribunal, dwarves of brell (pally for sure, so
probably cleric too) any evil race, are only at worst dubious which
you can do the quest at. Vah shir shaman (so presumeably the rest) are
only apprehensive. 

3 and 4 are very easy in terms of getting through with an exp quest
if you can kill decayed skeletons at all which I'd guess you could
easily. Of course if you are playing a twink, its no problem as with
the dark elf cleric I got from level 1 to 14 mainly with bone chips my
wood elf druid dumped to it near the east freeport sewers (after
buying them out hundreds at a time from vendors like the gfay newb
lift vendor.)
