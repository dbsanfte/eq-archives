Oh come on.  I've given handouts and what always mattered to me with
regards to them is that the recipient is actually going to use the
item I give him or her.  What sort of "good vibe" comes from knowing
that some level 12 with centis and a barbed ringmail ran off to sell
the banded leggings you gave him just 15 seconds after the exchange? 
Do you think he'll appreciate that gesture three days from now?

It's not a narrow minded purist attitude, it's making sure that the
intention you had in giving the gift was followed.  The problem with
the guy in the above example was that he sent the tell blind.  It's
not too hard to go find the proposed recipient to ensure you're
finding someone untwinked, especially when you're a level 60 hanging
around Kelethin with not much to do in the first place.
