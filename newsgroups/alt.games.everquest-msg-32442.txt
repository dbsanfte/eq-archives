Hi All,

I'm not much of a whiner, but my friend was killed by Wuoshi on TPing in and
I was killed trying to drag her corpse from the Kael zone.

How does one get their corpses from Wuoshi's aggro range? He has see invis,
is faster than a speeding bullet, and aggros on anything in sight. Won't he
aggro a non-KOS player dragging the corpse (velious rules)?

We ended up camping and logging on every two hours to see if someone had
killed him yet. Needless to say this made it difficult to enjoy a day I had
set aside for some serious questing.

It seems like all Velious TP's are somewhat dangerous, which is fine, but
when you make CR's impossible that's going a little too far...

Drywit
