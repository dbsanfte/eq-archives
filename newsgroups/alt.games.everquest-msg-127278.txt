"Trivial" in tradeskills means you'll no longer get skill
increases from making the item.  You always have a chance
of failure, estimated at around 5%.  Obviously, you can
have a bad streak and fail more (or have a good streak and
hardly fail at all) since the chance of success/failure
has a random component in it.
