In the sense that equipment has no physical requirements, and is constantly
being defined by the game manufacturer and then created out of nothing by the
game engine itself. 

More importantly, in the sense that there are orders of magnitude more
power available to characters with cutting-edge equipment than to those
with easily-gotten stuff.   It's quite possible to consider the character
itself to be equipment, in which case the power difference between a cheap
and expensive one is so much more noticeable than player skill it's not even
funny.

This is simply not true for other games/sports/activities brought up in this
thread.  Also, be aware that if it is NOT the case that equipment/character
matters so much, the whole question of ebaying becomes moot.

You're not competing against each other as the game.  You're competing for a
(stupidly, but that's a separate argument) limited resource within the game.
You don't care whether it's an ebayed twink or a horde of newbies or a wizened
old "legitimate" player who takes your camp.

I was thinking "flying airplanes for pleasure", where rich people get better
planes, can fly more routes, etc.  Racing, like most competitive events (and
unlike RPGs), has limits on equipment to minimize the effect of wealth.
