Oasis will probably not be included with live because the progressive
server is not going to be the classic EQ but rather current eq with
locked expansions.  As it is, Oasis was merged with South Ro as one
zone.

POK book were all in places but POK wasn't up last I tried.  Some
special zones like Nedaria went live with later expansion and probably
won't be available at launch.

I'm not aware of a detailed list.  A quick and dirty list would be to
look at EQAtlas.com site and ignore anything not part of Antonica
Faydwer, or Odus contenient.  That site has not been updated since POP
era and could be used as a general guide to what will be available.
