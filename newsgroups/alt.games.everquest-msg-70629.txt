Keep in mind, though, that the upgrade version of XP doesn't accept 95
as a qualifying previous version of Windows.  You'll need the full XP.
If you don't need Microsoft support, go for an OEM or DSP version,
since you'll save a lot that way.  Microsoft has greatly relaxed their
OEM requirements over the last few years, and it is legit to sell the
OEM version with pretty much any hardware (e.g., someone could bundle
the OEM XP with a power cord, and that would be fine :-)).
