I use the alternate viewpoints a lot when I need to try to target other than
the mob currently being beat upon.  I have to do this often for purposes of
slowing mobs that are next to die, plus, that makes the mob mad at me
instead of the enchanter, and I can take a lot more hits than most
enchanters can.
