I read these posts with anticipation every time I log Outlook Express, 
hoping to find more information about my favorite class - Beastlords... I 
run 3 on MS, a 57, and 2 12s... My 57 is a Vah Shir and the 2 12s are an 
Iksar and a Barbarian (just wanted to see the warder difference between 
races).

In all the threads that I've followed, everyone seems to be hung up on SKs, 
Pallys, and casting classes... Occasionally, I see a reference made to 
Warriors, Rangers and the occasional bard... but no one seems to either 
think much of, or play a beastlord...

Is this class really the dregs I'm getting the impression it is?? Or is it a 
class that is so well rounded between some melee, some nuking, some healing, 
some buffing that it goes without needing to be expanded upon...

Or is it just the fact that you are all die hard players that don't deal 
with a hybrid class??

I don't want to offend, as I've picked up valuable info from most of you... 
but I really want to know...

Thanx,

A lone beastie on Maelin Starpyre
