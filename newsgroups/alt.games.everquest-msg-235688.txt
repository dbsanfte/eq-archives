    True.  But those millions aren't in the United States, by and large.  In
this country, at this time, the accepted practice is to let ones children self
select their mates.

   And this, I think, is at the heart of the matter of why this guy is so
weird.  Yes, what he is suggesting has been suggested before.  Yes, in other
cultures it has been fine for a man to have multiple wives.  But in this place,
at this time, his goal is weird.
