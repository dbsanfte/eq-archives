I don't disagree that individual classes are more suited to specific zones
or mobs/pulls.
My point is that any of the 3 can still work effectively in any of the
others "specialised" fields too.

I know that skill plugs the tools gap. Simply because there is never just
one way of doing things, never just one "good" or timely way of doing
something, and as a result any of the 3 can use the tools he does have,
combine it with skill and knowhow, and produce good enough results.

Well you could give examples as to why monks pulling is only ever out of
courtesy, and never because they offer a valid contribution to the pull
team. The way i see it, the way my highly respected and highly skilled
guildies see it, is that teamwork and cross-class skills/tools is what wins
the day. Not any one monk, not any one bard, and not any one SK.  And even
when one class does excel in a set area, it hardly changes anything. You
zone into the adjacent zone, and suddenly the opposite statement holds true,
the opposite class now excels.

I know that if 1 of 5 people in my guild pulls or tags, we won't be waiting
on mobs, fucking up on a regular basis, training and dieing etc.  It doesn't
matter what zone, what mobs, whos prefered environment it is, if one of the
5 people, we will be getting a competent job done.  And those 5 break down
as 2 monks, 2 bards, and 1 Sk.

Skill and knowhow > anything else.
