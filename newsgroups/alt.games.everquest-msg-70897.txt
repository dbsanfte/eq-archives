Eh, ok.  If good loot is dropping yes, of course, balancing the plat is
important.  If you win an item (even if it's no-drop) everyone else should
be compensated as fairly as possible with the other loot that drops, and
most of the time this doesn't come close to being equal.

Let's say that you have 6 people in your group.  Phat_loot01 drops, worth
5kp.  Rogue gets it, due to NBG (used in the fairest sense...he doesn't have
one, and it's a nice upgrade for something else).  Nothing else of value
except trash gems & no-stat jewelry valued at 1300p.  I'll say right here
that NBG in pickup groups is stupid, but some folks insist on it, so I'll
use it in this example.

Cleric spends 300p in peridots.

The only fair way (in pickup groups...guild groups are either more or less
complicated) to distribute the loot is:

Rogue gets nothing
Off the top cleric gets 300p worth of loot leaving 1000p to split.
5 people, including the cleric get 200p each (cleric 500p total).

Well, the cleric didn't get 500p, he got 1300p.  He's brand new to the guild
and it was only 3 people in my guild in the group and he doesn't have enough
history with ANY of us to see if he was due not only my 200p but the other 3
people's 200p.  I need that cash. :P

No one volunteers to give me peridots for Rune...that's why I rarely cast
it, I usually lie and say I don't have any. :)  There are VERY few zones
where everyone needs 'dot'd anyway. MT, enc, and cle...that's it.  If
someone steals aggro from the MT long enough to get killed without it, then
dying is the price you pay for not managing your aggro *shrug*.

I can't help it...I don't like it when a cleric unknown to me gets 200p out
of my pocket for contributing absolutely nothing more to the group than me.
