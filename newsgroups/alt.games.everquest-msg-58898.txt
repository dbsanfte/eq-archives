Smoke crack much? The only classes IN THE WHOLE GAME who have worse AC and
melee than druids are the int caster classes. EVERYONE ELSE IS BETTER.
Druids are total shit at all forms of melee past level 10 or so.

No, they should be sitting on their ass meditating when they aren't
casting.

"most" of the time!? A WARRIOR HITTING WITH HIS BARE HANDS DOES MORE DAMAGE
THAN A DRUID WIELDING HIS EPIC.
