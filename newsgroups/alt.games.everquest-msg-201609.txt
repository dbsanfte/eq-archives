I got the itch to get back into D&D recently. After some searching, I 
hooked up with a couple of guys on the internet who lived fairly close. 
We met at a neutral site for the first encounter, the main public library 
in a nearby county.

One of them was a bit of a pasty type who appeared to be a bit on the 
effeminate side and wouldn't look at you directly. The other was a short 
scrawny type with an eyeglasses prescription that must have to be filled 
by the Hubble team. Personal hygiene didn't appear to be his strong suit, 
and he wasted little time bringing up his interest and regular enjoyment 
of playing the dominated role in an S&M relationship.

All of this could possibly have been overlooked (ick, maybe not) if they 
had any semblance of communication or general social skills. They didn't.

It's a bit of a bummer, but I've decided that with none of my friends 
much into it anymore, it's a lost cause. :(
