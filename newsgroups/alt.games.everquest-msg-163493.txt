Freeport can take you up to 53 or so on the militia inside the city.  Neriak
can get you up to 55 or so in Commons, and a bit higher I believe in 3rd
Gate.  The loot is not bad in Neriak either.  I think that if you later
switch to North Freeport, it can take you on up higher, but not sure, they
love me there.
