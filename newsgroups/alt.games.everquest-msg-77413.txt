If everything was like you told us here, then this is the case where
you should /ignore people and /petition if they train you on purpose.
Also don't forget to turn /log on as soon as you figure out it might be
 useful and if they say something offending before /ignore, do a
/report playername and petition then.
A GM once told me that /report sometimes only works when you
have the offending lines in chat window, so you might need to scroll
up.

Just don't let them distï¿½rb your playing...
