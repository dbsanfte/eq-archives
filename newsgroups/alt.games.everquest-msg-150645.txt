I'm very new to porting people around to earn some extra income.  I have
received donations ranging from 3 to 45 plat and had alot of fun doing it.
Last night a nice lady gave me a small piece of Velium as payment for a
port.
I thanked her for it, but I just wanted to know if it is worth anything.  An
ingame friend of mine said that the joke is on me and I should never port
her again, but she seemed very sincere and was very polite.
So, is it worth anything?
