Maybe because I had no issue with that part of your post.

dstep said he'd leave a group where a Cleric though he/she should melee
*instead* of healing.

You responded to say that would be his loss...uh uh, his gain, any group
where the healer is melee'ing and not healing is not one that I'd ever want
to be part of. He was suggesting a scenario where the Ceric didn't think his
primary role was healer and you seemed to be saying I'll play how I want, if
you don't like buh bye.
