I haven't actually used a black blade of tormenting, so I dont' know the
aggro on it.   Nor how much of a damage hit you will take for it.

My, aren't we exadurating what I said just a bit...

Thats nice.   Try playing with an epic Paladin, SK or Ranger sometime.   I'm
sure your warrior friends could hold aggro over you, but doubtful as to the
other three, unless the player behind that hybrid was extremely skilled.

I play a warlord, and have for months and months.  Before I got my epic, I
tended to think as you did and use non-procing weapons with the lowest delay
/ best ratio.  I was main tank at more raids than I can count.  Aggro
control was always a serious issue, and problems were common.   Getting my
epic, with it's very nice proc, solved each and every one of these problems.

Hell, I still have a Swiftblade of Zek (11dam 18 delay) that I use with the
non-proc epic blade for when I don't want aggro, or when damage output is
more important than maxing out hate.   Atempting to use this with my paladin
friend in the group means he would be tanking the entire night.  I also have
a great big slow axe (43 delay!), that does sweet damage and a frequent 125
DD proc with stun.  I hold aggro perfectly well using it, no matter who is
in the group.

As far as high end tanking is concerned, procs are God.
