Another good question...

No, your price would ideally be set by your characters realistic
needs. What needs would a level one have? First level spells, are a
few gold each, and weapons appropriate to your level are usually loot.

Bandages? Cheap. 
Food? Cheap
Water? Cheap

You work your way up in levels incrementally & according to ability
rather than by an uber weapon or armor you bought in the bazaar. 

So your needs = Price A

The level 60 was much more expensive needs, but also spent a lot less
effort to achieve the same results. 

Effort = Price B

In an ideal world, Prices A & B would be roughly equal. 

But then again, this is just an economic theory, and not necessarily
one I subscribe to whole-heartedly. But it amazes me how many people
have gotten their panties in a wad because someone has a different
opinion than they. 

Just my thoughts..
