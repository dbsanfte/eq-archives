I never said soloing a Warrior was a work of genius.
I will say that I have always considered it an incredibly stupid
aspect of the game design that casters can solo effectively and
melees cannot.

How convenient that you ignore the more "normal" example I gave of a
group with a single healer encountering long (15 minute) downtime
should they have the unmitigated gall to actually take on a challenge
rather than just grinding away on risk-free low blues.  It is a real
flaw in the game that in normal play the greatest reward is given for
the most mindless behavior (and that applies equally to xp grinding
vs. easy mobs as well as being just another ant in the raid machine
pharming dragons X, Y, & Z for the umpteenth time).
