My necro found this for sale in erudin SK guild on a normal merchant look at
the bottom of the inventory and the right merchant will also have the coffin
component for it, called something like Black Ornate Coffin.

Spell cost 18pp and coffin 39pp. Coffin is giant size, wt 10lb and non
stackable, must be grouped to cast, and both caster and target in same zone as
corpse and only works on players up to a certain level <have heard lv 35 but
not confirmed it>.
