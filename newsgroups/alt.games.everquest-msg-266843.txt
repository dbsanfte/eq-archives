Consider the case of an antarctic fish that had to develop an antifreeze 
gene for its blood due to environmental temperature change, and did so. 
The sequence of mutations and changes to the genes are known, and even 
the time frame that it happened (determined independantly from the 
geological record showing the cooling period), but the odds that it 
could have been driven by evolution's random mutation and natural 
selection within the allowed time frame appear to be 10^370 against.

Thus the working theory of evolution, in no uncertain terms, predicts it 
wouldn't happen. It happened. Biologists are investigating it...

Another simple case:

quote:
"Darwin wrote that evolution was a gradual process, with infinitesimal 
changes accumulating over the ages to eventually yield major differences 
in living things. If evolution advances as Darwin says it must, only 
tiny steps would ever happen. He states in The Origin of Species: "If it 
could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not 
possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, 
my theory would absolutely break down".
/quote

This of course has made the apparent existence of irreducible systems 
troubling for most proponents of the theory, except you. Regardless...


quote:
"Evidence from fossils does not bear out Darwin's theory of gradual 
change. Instead, species remain relatively unchanged for long periods, 
and then suddenly, new kinds arise." 
/quote

This led to the a theory called "punctuated equilibrium" which matches 
the fossil record better than gradualism does, but this has its own 
problems:

quote:
"Today there is still considerable discord over punctuated equilibrium. 
How real is stasis (the period without appreciable change), how gradual 
is punctuation, and how can neo-Darwinists account for them? One 
proposal is "species sorting" or "species selection." In general, the 
new idea is that big evolutionary steps occur gradually in small, 
isolated populations. When the evolutionary steps are complete, the 
small population with its new advantage quickly expands and replaces the 
bigger population. Thus, in the geological record the change looks 
instantaneous. This solution has some appeal, but it offers little more 
by way of explanation than that gradual evolution always takes place 
somewhere out of sight. In 1931, J.B.S. Haldane foresaw this problem. 
"The paleontologist can always postulate a slow evolution in some area 
hitherto unexplored geologically, followed by migration into known 
areas" (14). Perhaps punctuated equilibrium is a clue that the genetic 
mechanism underlying evolutionary progress is altogether different from 
the one currently in favor."

Oh...my... perhaps evolution is wrong? Perhaps, for example, there is 
additional information coded into the genome that we haven't begun to 
tap into, that directs the generation of genes (this is a hypothesis in 
the fish scenario).... 

Perhaps not.

But evolution isn't answering the question satisfactorily so we ought to 
be looking to replace it with a better theory.

And no, I'm not suggesting creationism is a better theory. Not even an 
'as good as' theory.
