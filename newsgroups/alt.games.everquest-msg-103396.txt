	They are half that, tops, and on the more mature servers they are falling
below the 1K mark.

|Remember those people who <aren't> twinking?

	Statistically insignificant.

	In fact, not only can you design the game around twinking, you MUST.  A
sane mud design must take into account the permanency of goods and what
happens when high-quality goods are passed to characters who otherwise
couldn't obtain them.  EQ's original designers considered this an
inconsequential issue and the result is the mess we're in now.

|What about the real newbies, the ones without a spare
|trivial 2K to pass down?

	They don't exist, at least not in numbers large enough to amount to
anything.  As soon as a "real newbie" runs into either a) a "starter guild" (a
guild that isn't going to accomplish anything of note and probably won't last
six months, but takes in anyone with a heartbeat) or b) a veteran cleaning his
bank, he'll cease to be a newbie.

	That's your fault then, you should get out more.  Make connections, get
yourself hooked up.  If you'd made him a Wood Elf chick you'd have all this
stuff by now.

	When Venture was 31, he had thousands of platinum (well, when he wasn't
broke from failing a bunch of Darkwoods in a row), and wore gear worth
thousands more, without twinking.  I did have the advantage of being able to
fletch my way into that money, which you probably won't be able to do these
days on a server older than, say, a week, but if you (say) went out an hunted
Wisps for a week you'd at least be able to upgrade that jewelry.
