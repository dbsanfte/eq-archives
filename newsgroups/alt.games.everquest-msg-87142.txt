Hi all,
Just two quick questions for you all. A long, long, time ago my Druid
decided he needed some armor, so I made him some patchwork. Being my first
char he is rather poor. Lately (at level 17) he has realized he needs better
armor. So I look at the next advancements in tailoring and they require
other items besides those that I can find on the ground.
For things like studs and steel bonings (I think that is right), is there
anywhere I can buy them? Like from a NPC Merchant, or do I need to take up
smithing just to get these things?

Second question, lot of sites mention types of Tailoring as being trivial at
certain levels. What does this mean?

Thanks in advance,
Chaos
