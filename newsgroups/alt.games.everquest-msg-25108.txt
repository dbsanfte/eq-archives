Did he say it bugged him that you asked? It didn't bug him, but he
expected you to meet his price requirement, which you didn't. His time
and the mana for the spell (it's NOT 'only mana'. Are your HP 'only
HP'?) were worth 50-70 pp to him.
You sound like one of the warriors who expect casters to wait on your
every need because you're a TANK and they're only there (un-anon) to
cater to you. People like that make *me* sick.
