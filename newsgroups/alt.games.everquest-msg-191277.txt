I'm beginning to realize that a lot of my "Impressions" come from
previous experience with other games. In Ultima Online the "Grind" is
not so much experience gathering as it is GOLD gathering. there the
craftables are undertaken more for profit as you can "Master" them in
a fairly rapid progression. At least you used to be able to. Once my
blacksmith there made Grand Master (Max of 100 skill level at that
time) I made a million in gold in under a month. That more than made
up for the investments I had made to get to that point!

Here the tradeskills seem to be more of a diversion at least until you
get to the higher levels.
