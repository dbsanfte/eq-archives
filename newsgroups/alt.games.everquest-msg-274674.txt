Exact same thing happened to me in OoT recently.

Once I set my pet on a mob, I'd lose sight of both mob and warder and 'could 
not see your target' when trying to melee.

If I moved more that 4-5 steps, I'd have to summon my warder from wherever 
it was he'd disappeared to.

Spells took forever to mem and cast - it was just hellacious.

People zoning in (for Druid epic 1.0, I believe) were fine for a minute or 
two then were also plagued with the same problems.

We all left to petition. Servers came down shortly after (once, twice? can't 
remember) and everything was ok after that. Never heard anything about my 
petition...

Downed my first AC soon after, though! :-)

Regards,

Zoop
