There's a knife that procs summoning bandages which might also be useful to
reduce downtime without having to carry a lot of bandages.  The number
summoned is equal to half your level, so by 37 you are getting 18 at a time,
and it procs enough that if you just use it when it is safe (on easy greens,
or when you are sure you are going to win against harder mobs), you should
always have free bandages.
