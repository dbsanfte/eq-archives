I don't think the game has changed much. <grin>  But what you get out of it will
depend entirely on your expectations and what you bring with you to it, like
most anything else in life.

Yeah, that's going to be your life for your first 4 or five levels, sadly. But
it gets way better after that, trust me.

For your first character with no established higher level friends yet, no higher
level characters of your own, no guild, etc. get used to the idea of being broke
for many levels before you start really cashing in. Again, it's worth it if
you're willing to put in the time to get there.

Tip #1. If you are in the habit of typing things like "B4" instead of "before",
get out of it now.  You'll only annoy a lot of the people who *might* have been
otherwise inclinded to help you get ahead.  #2. Never beg. People hate beggers.
#3. Always be polite, particularly if you are asking for something like SoW (a
spell to make you run faster) or a heal or a port (magical transport to another
location) etc. Always offer to make a donatation if you can. #4. Learn to group
early in your career. Use the /shout command to say "/shout Level 5 Warrior (or
whatever) looking for group!" You'll meet lots more people, make friends, and
advance faster. #5. Read this newsgroup a lot, avoiding the pointless flame
threads. You'll get lots of good tips.  #6 Go bookmark
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and http://eq.castersrealm.com/ as well as the
Sony homepage.  These resources will provide tons of valuable information. [more
tips below]

From what I've seen of three servers, and what I read of others, they are all
the same except the PvP (player killer) servers. Just pick one that's green on
the server selection screen. They have the lowest populations and will hopefully
have a little less lag, etc.

>  What type of character should I be for my 1st character? etc. etc. etc.

You can be whatever you enjoy most. You likely won't keep your first character
anyway. A basic melee type is nice to start out with at first to learn the
interface. A warrior, monk, rogue, or even a paladin to learn something about
how to use spells. Start a pure caster too (wizard, mage, necro, cleric) to
learn about that. Try to avoid the evil races at first, since faction can be a
headache. I would say a Dwarven or Barbarian warrior *might* be a nice first
character to take a look around with.  Up to you, though.  And if your set came
with the tutorial, run that first. It will help.
   If you don't want to spend ten days on bugs and bats, realize that the only
effective way you are going to advance is by getting out there and killing stuff
and getting experience.  Sure, go turn in your note to your guild when you first
start, but then get out there, kill everything that cons even (black/white) or
lower to you, loot everything you find and sell it to vendors. Save up your
money. Save bone chips from decaying skellies to sell by the stack to higher
level characters. There's a good early money making tip for you. Most of all,
talk to people. Get in groups. Suck the knowledge of the world out of them for
tips, etc. and make friends that you can rely on. Keep on killing. If you waste
your time trying out low level quests and "looking around town", you may enjoy
yourself, but you won't be doing anything to get out of bug/bat hell.

Hope that helps.
