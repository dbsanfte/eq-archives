Who said anything about magical powers? Most people pray to
"communicate" with their god. The self-therapy explanation is one I've
never heard before it was presented here and, honestly, totally
removes it from being a religious practice. I'm not trying to tell
anyone they shouldn't pray. Mostly this is an illustration of the
flaws in trying to apply logic to religion. They simply don't mesh.
