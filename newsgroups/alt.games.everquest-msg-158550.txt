Im a magician.. And im just tired of being a erudite..

Im just plain not cute enough...

I know at 50 something, we can use AA points to transform into an
elemental..

But  before that, is there anything i can do to change my race...

I remember an item called guise of the deciever that turned you into a dark
elf, but it was removed from the game, and replaced with a rogue/bard only
version. Can any class yse the rogue/bard mask for its illusion compnent
only? Is there any item out there which i can use to change my form?

Thanks for the advice.
