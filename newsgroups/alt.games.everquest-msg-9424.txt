This doesn't sound like an enchanter, more like a druid or a wizard.

This is acutally less helpful then you would imagine.  Mez is a level
4 spell with a pretty good cast time, and quite often will cast
through a hit or two.  Enchanter stun spells are close in area spells
with a very fast cast time, and provide enough time to get off a mez
or even a charm if things are really bad.

Ahh, here is your key misconception.  Many tanks suffer from this.
The cleric primary job is to keep the enchanter healthy.  His
SECONDARY job is to keep the tank healthy.  This is how it normally
works.

Puller pulls mobs to group.

Primary assist tank starts attacking.

Other damage dealers use /assist to target the tank's target.

Enchanter mez's everything else.

Anything that resists mez comes after enchanter.

Enchanter stuns then mez's.

If the mob resist stun (a very fast casting spell) and manages to beat
the enchanter down, the cleric throughs a heal on the enchanter (not
the big honking full heal that he has to throw on the tanks, the less
mana intensive heal that he got a couple levels ago, enchanters have a
much shallower HP pool).

The mob (or mobs, usually healing pulls all the mobs off the
enchanter) now starts beating on the cleric (who has the HP and the
armor to put up with it for a while).

The enchanter mez's the mess around the cleric.

The melee's hopefully have managed to stay focused on the target and
not been distracted by this very normal business and have managed to
put down their first target and are ready to shift to the next target.

Enchanters know this.  Clerics know this.  Melees don't have a need to
know.

The enchanter hardly ever is the leader becuase he is just to damn
busy.  Melees make good group leaders, because during combat, they
have PLENTY of spare time to talk.  Occassionly hitting the kick,
bash, or slam key doesn't compare to target all the various mobs,
mezzing some, debuffing others, check to make sure no ones HP bar is
dropping too fast.  Enchanters have to spend much more attention on a
fight than the people who are actually doing the fighting.

By the way, want to annoy the enchanter next pull?  Drag the whole
mess right back to him.  Try to stay attached at the hip.  

Enchanters don't like being right in the middle of the fight unless
they decide to jump in the middle.  Usually they choose to be off to
one side or the other to get a clear view of the area.
