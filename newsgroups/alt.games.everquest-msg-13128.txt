In healthy people being overweight can be viewed by some as a sign of
"letting themselves go", like not getting a haircut, not shaving and not
bothering to wear clean clothes.

I am six foot and have been 95kilograms all my adult life. I got to 95kg
from gym six nights a week ages back. That was a long time ago and everyone
knows what happens to people who stop going to gym...  yep, lard arse city
here I am.

Do people view and treat me differently? For sure. Do I cuss and cry foul?
Not a chance. I know who and what is responsible. The 'who' equals me, and
the 'what' equals the fact I don't give a damn what other people think
anymore.

*shrugs*

If a friend thought I was somehow pathetic and needed "sticking up for"
because of my weight though, then <that> would bother the heck out of me...
