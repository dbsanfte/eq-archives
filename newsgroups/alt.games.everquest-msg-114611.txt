Outside of very small optimizations being possible, the only
improvement we get is EQ2 which is an entirely new game in a year and
a half (with no character transfers though it sounds like you might be
able to reserve a name.. sounds messy to me though)

There is just a lot that they either can't or won't bother to do as
far as trying to "fix" current EQ. As evidenced with bard problems,
trying to fix this now ancient game engine or system often breaks
other stuff that they then have to fix. Its a lot of work to do. That,
in a nutshell, is why they are making EQ2 which is a fully new game
and game engine from scratch.

The luclin move to directX 8 in the engine and the luclin models took
this game about as far as it can get, creaking and screaming all the
way.
