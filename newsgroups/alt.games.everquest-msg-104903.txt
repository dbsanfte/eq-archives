It's also a good way to make sure that you're not getting
in over your head.  If you have trouble with the mobs halfway
to your camp spot, reconsider.

Also remember that Synthi Davisi, the NPC with the MM Drums
and the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, is an Enchanter, and
Enchanter mobs are always extra trouble.  She will
almost certainly charm a member of the group and use 
that person against the rest.  She charmed me several 
times even at 54.
