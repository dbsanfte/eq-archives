Wow! Well, it wasnt quite that simple, I'm forced to use Nullsofts installer
if I want the plugin to be on winamp.com, but adding 'start' to the
installer script and playing with quotes did the job. Thanks, theres an
updated version on my page now. I'll send it to winamp.com in a while, but
dont expect to see it there in the next 2 months. They're very slow...

BTW - its not an updated version of SneakyAmp, just the installer script. If
you have it already and understand it, dont bother. :)
