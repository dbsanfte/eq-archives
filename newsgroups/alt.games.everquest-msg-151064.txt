Hi Barb....the orginal question was mine. My druid is now lvl 32, and
while meeting a friend of mine in NK a few weeks ago, a HG just happen
to pass by.  I couldn't resist the temptation any longer :)   I hit
him with snare, DoT, and took off running.  My DD's didn't seem to
have much effect and were a waste of mana, but my DoT did slowly eat
away at him.  I had to recast SOW on myself once or twice, and snare
on him a few times, and of course, my DoT everytime it wore off.  I
also had to med whenever I could for mana.  In the end, I got him, but
it took almost a half hour and there were a few tense moments when
snare wore off ( those giants run fast and hit hard ).   It was a
tiumph, but there are certainly better ways to get exp/plat at lvl 32
:)
