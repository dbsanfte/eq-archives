Your subsequent quoting of an AI article which addresses
a point you did not originally make does not change the
fact that you misrepresented what was in the AI article
in order to make the original claim -- the one to which
I replied.

To remind you of your post:

what about the murder of 1000+ palestinians under isreali oppression that

This is an untruth and a misrepresentation.  Subsequent quotes
of AI and other sources to make other points does not change
this fact.  You would be more persuasive in your arguments
if 

1) You stop misrepresenting your sources
2) You acknowledge your misrepresentations
3) You stop trying to bullshit your way through these
conversations.
