I remember a website awhile back that showed how to get an all/all white
robe from the city of Shar Vahl from killing this particular mob.  Does
anyone have this link and/or info to do this?  I would love to see my
Halfling in a robe and was thinking of getting one for my monk to make him
look different; tired of the faded blue CCS.

TIA, Danny
