Hee. I do that too :)  "Explain 'need'." "Fuk off u s0w 
me man I ned it 4 CR!"

Tsk.  Thing is, I keep getting called a 'snob'.  Now how 
can I be a snob when I have ONE character who is lucky 
enough to have SoW all the time, and NINE characters who 
NEVER have SoW unless somebody offers (and even then, 
I'll offer a donation or apologize if I haven't got any 
money).
