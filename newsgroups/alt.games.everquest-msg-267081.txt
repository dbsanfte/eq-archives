"disadvantage" is only a meaningful term in hindsight. There is no way 
to predict a gene is disadvantageous, even if its killing the population 
left and right -today-.

Consider the gene for sickle cell disease. Clearly having sickle cell 
disease is a disadvantage with significant risk of death due to 
complications arising from the disease.

Clearly having the disease is a disadvantage, as you may die before you 
can reproduce. Clearly carrying the gene for sickle cell reduces your 
reproductive chances, as it increases the odds of your offspring 
developing sickle cell disease. Clearly the gene is a disadvantage.

Right?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, enter Malaria into the picture, its a terrible disease also capable 
of killing, particularly lethal to young children, thus preventing them 
from reproducing.

But there is hope, the gene for sickle cell provides a defense against 
malaria. And suddenly -not- having sickle cell trait is the 
disadvantage.

So if you have 2 Sickle-cell genes you, if you have no sickle cell genes 
you die. But if you have 1 gene, you are defended against malaria, and 
won't develop sickle cell disease and you live.

(Sadly, the combinatorics of the reproductive process doesn't allow us 
to select for having 1 gene, the odds are more or less fixed... a 
quarter with none, a quarter with 2, and half with 1. Yeah, I'm 
oversimplifying a bit... but you get the gist.)

The best chance of survival goes to those who carry the gene, but don't 
have the disease. And a gene that was a clear disadvantage becomes a 
clear advantage.
