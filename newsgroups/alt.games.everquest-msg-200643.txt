The desire to a guild picture out of dollz is very appealing...

I agree some shields and glowy red things and whatnot are in order, and
possibly more dress styles for the dark elf women at least (they have
multiple dresses for other races, so I'm thinking they just ran out of
time)....but I feel almost guilty saying that because what they've
already done is so spectacular.  

*fingers twitch towards the bookmark for eqpixel army, but she holds them
back because she is at work, and the firewall hits would no doubt be very
extensive*
