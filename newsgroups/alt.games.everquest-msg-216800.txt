Probably a good idea in BoT and usually my preferred way of pulling if
a druid is the main healer. Druid harmonies the potential adds and
shaman pulls with malo(s). The advantage of doing it that way is that
the mob is usually slowed by the time it gets to camp. Monks don't
pull particularly well in BoT from what I've seen, too many casters in
close quarters to make it even reasonably efficient.

It's nice when a main healer is good enough to recognize the
difference between low health due to cann5 and the fact that you're
getting beat on for a resisted slow but not something I ever expect.
I'm not too proud to call for a heal when I'm taking a serious
beating, healers get too used to seeing me at half hitpoints.

Well, BoR is an extra 10hp per tick of regen compared to the Velious
clicky BPs. Marginally useful in a place like BoT where only one
person gets hit but often a good idea when a lot of people in a group
are taking damage. Debateable either way imo.

Too much depends on the rest of the group in that situation to make
any judgements. If a group is used to working together, a shaman/druid
duo can heal well in BoT but a lot depends on the rest of the group.
Tanks have to be ready to peel off of the shaman on a resisted slow,
shaman needs to be a bit more careful on bad pulls because you have to
assume that in any bad situation a druid will be too busy to heal you,
shaman should be willing to use Quiessence to help save the druid's
mana.... 

  It doesn't sound like the shaman was particularly clueless. I'll
withhold comment as to whether he was a jerk or not, it's too hard to
judge just hearing one side of the conversation. 

Rgds, Frank
