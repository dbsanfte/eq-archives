What the hell are you talking about?  You know what?  Why don't you just
tell my what you think I said, because your point is too obtuse for me.

Straw man?  What straw man?  Tukka said "Just because they're utilizing
their GM privileges..." and I answered him.  We were both talking about GMs.
If you're using your GM powers you're logged in as a GM, just go figure,
right?  Every bit of info from Verant regarding GM's personal accounts are
that they are just the normal accounts that every other customer use, hence,
normal account equals no GM privileges.
