Especially in the part where it attracts people that use words like
"pwnz" non-ironically. Frankly, I consider this to be its best
feature. Every d00d drawn to WOW is one less I have to /ignore in EQ2.

I have already noticed the general chatter level in EQ2 is more mature
than that in other games I've played (granted, this is like noting
that "Yertle the Turtle" requires a higher reading level than "Green
Eggs And Ham"). With luck, when WOW ships in a few days, there will a
giant sucking sound as every k3wld00d flees Norrath for the 133t
friendly realms of...uh...wherever it is WOW is set.

I think SOE should use this in marketing.

EQ2: For people who can spell.
EQ2: Because you're not 13 anymore.
EQ2: Meet people online you wouldn't mind meeting in the real world.
