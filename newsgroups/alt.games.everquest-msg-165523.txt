The gal in freeport that sells the purification tablets was WAY out of 
position - in the Newbie area - so I couldn't do the quest.  Well, I 
thought I couldn't.

After I petitioned her 3 more people had shown up to do this quest ( within 
1 minute of me being there ).  One of them mentioned that there is some guy 
in the tunnels "Toxisomething" that also sells the stuff.   Well, being an 
Enchanter, I -know- where that guy is, so I went there, and bought my 
tablet.  The other guys followed and I bought theirs for them ( in DE form 
) since this piece isn't no-drop.

It's good to be the chanter.
