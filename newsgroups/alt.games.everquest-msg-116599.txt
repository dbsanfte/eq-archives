FWIW, wisps require "magic" weapons, something I know that *I* did not have
until Month Three or so.

But if you can't afford 10p for a port, you really need to be running.
Newbies have no need for ports...I only port them for extreme reasons, and I
can't think of any of those off the top of my head.

Oh yeah, I can think of one.  A barbarian in Kelethin asked me wolf form so
she could do her banking.  Sure, np.  I was about to port my enchanter to
Surefall, but I could wait for a second while she came over.  So, I group
with her, Wolf her, disband her, then port over to SFG.

...as soon as I noticed that my enchanter didn't go anywhere I realized that
I disbanded the wrong character.  BAH.  So I apologize profusely, port her
to Steamfont, run her back to Kelethin, wolf her, and got the hell outta
Dodge. :)
