Sorry, but your reading comprehension is off the mark here.  His thesis,
stated again and again, is DO YOUR HOMEWORK!  That is all my original post
was aimed at.  Yes, he tells the story of the annoying out of character
tells to illustrate his point.  There is a simple answer to that.  /ignore

The KS gets only a brief mention in his post.

In response to the rest of your post, tells across zones do not help the
immersiveness of the game.  They are there to facilitate communication
between friends and groups.  If someone is giving tells that ruin the mood
of the game, /ignore them.
