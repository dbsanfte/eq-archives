I am a 52 druid who is just the stone from VSR away from getting elaborate
scimiter but I am in a small guild with not enough 50+ ppl to take him out.
I have tried sitting at ent in kc shouting for volunteers to help and either
get lots of tells saying "I will help but i want a stone" or very few tells
at all.
I am on ayonae ro server so if any of you here on my server would be willing
to lend their skill for this mob i would be eternally grateful.
