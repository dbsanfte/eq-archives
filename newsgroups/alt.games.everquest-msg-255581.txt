You should stop reading the rags, they went byebye to credibility a
long time ago. Anyways there are a lot of alternatives to EQ and more
on the way. If you are patient you can wait for WoW which from most
accounts should do many things better than EQ, mostly because they can
design for them from the start while EQ has to fight with its
framework to add anything new, or EQ2 which will try to do things
differently. Also Vanguard at least 18 months away, but out there
lurking in the shadows, if you preferred Brad's "Vision" to today's
dreck.

If you can't wait, DAoC, AO, AC, SWG, even UO are all serviceable
alternatives, each with its own positives and negatives. There's also
a few less stellar options; I don't recommend trying Horizons,
Shadowbane, AC2, Lineage 2, or any of the space ones.

This is going a bit far afield... but anyways do you think this
doesn't happen in every war? And yet we have games about every war in
history, or so it seems. As far as I know you can't actually burn down
villages and children, poison forests and men, or anything else like
that in that game (though I could be wrong).

If you like your shooters to be clean, play Unreal Tournament. That's
where I get my violence fix (other than usenet).
