Well, if you're a low level character, selling stacks of batwings (used for
Levitate spells) and bone chips (used to summon Necro pets) to other players
is a good way to start.

Also, if you're in the Freeport area, selling DF belts from Orc Camp raids
is a good idea. Turning the belts in yourself is a bad idea, unless you do
it for faction, because your skills won't go up as quickly as they would if
you levelled up the hard way. (Same goes for Crushbone belts if you're
around Kaladim or Gfay)

Me, I mainly get plat right now by killing Willowisps with my level 14
Warrior and selling any Greater Lightstones to other players. Regular
Lightstones I just shove in the bank until I can get to Oasis of Marr and
hand them over to Sythian for the exp and books to resell.
