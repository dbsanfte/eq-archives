<snip lament about not being able to buy tailoring supplies>


> A tailor is what I want to be damn it!  :p   help please....


As far as I have heard tailoring requires either pelts or silks.  Until 
the spinning wheel comes to Norrath we're stuck.


> any suggestions?


Nope :)

I have two friends who are master tailors, they each started lowbie 
characters and leveled up until they could go to the Karanas and hunt 
animals and spiders.  Wu's armor is good for skill, but I understand you 
still need silks.
