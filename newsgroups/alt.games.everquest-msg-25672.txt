Try to head to Steamfont, had 2 gnomes DEMANDING money or items from me, and
when i told them i didnt have anything they told me i was lying, and i just
had to hand over the FP bracer i was auctioning over (What a gnome want with
a Large FP bracer i still havent found out). After 2 begs like that in 1 hour
i ported out, and dont plan to get back.
