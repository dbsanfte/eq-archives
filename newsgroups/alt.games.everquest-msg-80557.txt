A few extra pointers: Usually, a buffed tank in normal conditions (not
swarmed by mobs or fighting a red one) will be completly cured in time if
you wait to cast it around that point where the 'goes berserk' messages pops
up.

Also, I usually try to time CHs so that the mob is past three quarters dead
as to not aggro the heck out of them.

Note: After CHing a tank, be prepared to have any extra mobs take a very
sudden interest in you... ;-)

Be safe,
