Well, if you're going to insist on questing, then Ivy Etched is the
way to go.  And you're right, some pieces are just too hard to do at
your level.  If you don't have a regular group of playing friends to
help you out with them, you need to join a guild, make some friends,
and eventually ask for help.  Remember, however - joining a guild, and
then five minutes later typing "/gu Can anyone come help me get my Ivy
Etched boots?" is in very poor form.  I highly suggest learning to
love the bazaar though - the search tool will allow you to search by
the particular stat you feel is the most important, and you can input
your desired price range.  It's incredibly well designed, and has led
to drastic price drops on most items.
