If your main is 26th, I would suggest gargoyle island in the Ocean of Tears.  I
just spent level 21-24 there (fast too, like two days real time.)

The Gargs are all blue at 24, and sometimes drop gargoyle eyes. Either one,
two, or none.  The eyes sell for 8 plat to a warmly vendor.

In my time there, I ended up with a total of 74 eyes, I have ALL my 24th level
spells, and 511 plat in the bank.
