Nothing is written in stone they can change anything anytime they want.
Big changes have come that people said would never happen.
I wouldn't discount anything.

So they change it. No biggie. Its just a program. They got all these programmers
sitting around. Might as well use them for something.

Nah. Just level limit them or leave them.

Mobs don't follow the same rules as PCs anyway. They could change
them without changing PC stuff.

50 bucks says they adds more levels. Any takers?

They have to do something to keep people interested and playing.
No sense in letting a cash cow die. They are going to keep ole' Bessy
