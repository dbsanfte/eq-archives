Pretty much how I am about it. I never *ask* for money, but if someone
offers without being asked, I accept without complaint. I've given
many free ports, and I've accepted up to 50p for a single port so far.
And I don't even have one of the "high demand" ports yet...

Now, if the offered donation for the port is less than 10p and the
character is obviously a newbie nontwink, I will refuse the
donation...
