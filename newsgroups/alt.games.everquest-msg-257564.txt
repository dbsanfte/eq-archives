Pets are treated just like everyone else as far as agro is concerned.
Only difference is a biggy. A mob will attack which ever PC has the
highest Hate if there is a PC in melee range. So if you have 10 pets
around a mob, it will attack the pet with the highest hate. If you
have 9 pets and a PC around a mob, it will attack the PC. But only if
the PC has some hate at all. (Say if the PC does not own one of the
pets around the mob, has not attacked or cast a spell on the mob, and
is normally not KoS, he could stand next to the mob without getting
attacked.)
