    And eventually replace THESE with Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings: AC 2
HP 35 MANA 25. ;-)

    CCS would be the better alternative of the two for a high elf. It is
quite lightweight, and has STR and resists on it. The BS Tunic is more a
dwarf cleric / soloing shammy sort of item.

    This would be a good item to buy, as the camp is frequently occupied by
farmers. And like they've said, it'll last you a LONG time. Until then, your
old Shiny Brass Shield from Crushbone will be fine.

    Or, get out your pocketbook again. The Kunzar Cloak is AC 7 INT 2 WIS 2
Sv. Fire 10, and is quite lightweight. Since it is the common drop in a
high-level zone, I frequently see them for 200 or less - or sold to
merchants. :-/ It provides about as good protection in a back-slot WIS item
as you'll get before high level.

    Both excellent choices. Also consider the Ulthork Hide Bracer, AC 6 WIS
1 INT -1. Fair AC, and they're dirt cheap.
