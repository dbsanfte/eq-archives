I still think shaman spell progression is a mess, so i'm probably

The story I heard is that stats used to be really useful. Then 
Verant realised that no one would play any warrior but an ogre
warrior. It made the optimum class/race matching too efficient
for most people to consider alternatives. So they heavily
reduced the importance of stats.

The only buffs I consider to be truly worth casting are those that
affect primary combat stats by a noticeable amount. So for me the
only stat buff I bother with is STA (although HoS does the melee
stats anyway). I sometimes do strength because it raises the max
hit so melee get all excited, even though I suspect the actual
change in DPS is marginal.

Our HP buffs start to stack with cleric and druid buffs, which is
really their strength. Of course the cleric ones are better and 
the damn druids get group versions. I dream of having group harness
or focus.

Remains the same i'm afraid. Abysmal time and mana efficiency.

It is very noticeable. My druid friends used to ask me to DoT the
mob when they wanted to break root so they could re-position it.
The druid snares will also continue to inspire jealousy.

The problem with spells is that they also haven't suffered from
inflation in the same way gear has. Dotting for N points per tick,
at a sizable cost in mana, isn't so impressive when you know a
twinked melee is using a weapon that would once have been considered
godly. Of course KEI can make the mana question nearly irrelevant.

There are sizable gaps in the shaman healing progression. There is
a large gap where trying to keep an MA up with greater healing
becomes more and more farcical. And once the clerics get CH any
vestige of competition is over.

Slow is uber, no doubt about that. However in my experience groups
of even moderately twinked melee go through mobs like smarties. As
such it can be somewhat hard to see the effect of slowing. Likewise
healing efficiency takes a huge jump when clerics get CH, which
reduces the importance of slow.

Only druid roots have a DD component. And they get a non-DD root
as one of their PoP spells. It is fairly short lived though.

Together these spells generate much less mana than you might think.
If you do the numbers you'll find it's only something like 4 mana
per tick (assuming perfect canni-dancing). Which tends to get chewed
up because a lot of the shaman spells are very costly. It's a nice
ability to have, but people expect it to be "infinite mana" and it
really isn't.

Haste is, I think, our best contribution to a group. It's really
annoying to maintain, and somewhat of a mana drain, but the
contribution to group DPS more than makes up for it. However as
you noted enchanters do it much better (and can also slow and
increase mana regen, although there's is for the whole group).

IVU through alchemy. Never get a superior version of invis. Improved
invis is one of those things that make life so nice.

The best part about the pet is the fact it's one thing we kick
the druids ass in doing. The L34 dogdog will kick the ass of
bobo the bear. Mind you, the druids can charm stalkers in PoN
which sort of ultimately wins them the pet debate.

Whatever you can do to get a group, because any group will be
better than solo XP. My shaman (first character) was really
badly equipped. So while I could solo the kill rate was just
awful. Good haste and weapons, funghi, KEI would all make a
big difference if you have access to them. I didn't.

In groups I would buff the melee. I didn't feel they were
anything special but melee tend to get this "security blanket"
feeling when they see a screen full of buffs. Haste was the
first buff I got which I felt actually justified my role.

Healing is probably the main thing you bring however to get
you upto mid levels. While your heals will suck your mana dry
while causing only minimal movement in a twinkies health bar
they remain the second best heals in the game. And every melee
group needs healing, probably even two healers at low levels.
