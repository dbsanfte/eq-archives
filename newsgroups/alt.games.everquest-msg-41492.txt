Point conceeded.  Players are the customer base, so
of course their questions and feelings have no bearing
on anything...worthless scum that they are.

And it just sounds like a hastily created no-answer.  "Concealing
the server numbers from our competitors?"  That's a load of
crap! I mean, honestly, that's crap.  When the upper-tier folks
at VI crow about those same numbers every opportunity they
get?

Yep, that's me.  Playing for over two years, I pounce greedily on
VI for EVERYTHING!  Again, I laid out my reasons why
this appears to be a shoddy thing to do.  Will I quit playing?
No! I love this game.  Will I get upset the first time I get a
LD on a Saturday afternoon and am told by CS,"It's your
ISP" when I used to for damn sure know within 4 minutes
whether it's my ISP or VI? Yes.  Will I be upset if someday
they combine E. Marr and Saryn and don't tell anybody
because, economically, it is easier than two separate servers
("Your increase lag is probably your ISP, it would have
nothing to do with the fact that we have 6421 people on
your server at the moment...huh? 392 folks in L. Guk?
Hmmm...must be a GM event...contact your ISP")? Yes.
