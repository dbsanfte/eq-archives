Yuppers!  And my other choice would be the Neon SRT, a really foolish little pocket
rocket.

Oh, yeah.  And whatta V-6 it was.  But it was pretty rare, only 547 were delivered.  The
Regal Grand National was very hot too, and much more obtainable.

Heh, one of my favorite cars of all time was a little bitty 1992 Escort GT, with the 1.8L
Mazda DOHC 16-valve I-4.  8k RPM redline with great 5-speed manual.  I loved dumping the
clutch at 4.5k!  Cruising at 3.5k because anything slower was a waste.  Put that little
blender in puree and let 'er rip!

Before that there was the I-6 280ZX.  And the 1974 455 Cutlass Supreme, a real pooch
saddled with a ton of emissions gear.  And then there was the 351W LTD-II sedan that gave
its guts to a Mustang-II hatchback, which terrorized the streets of St. Louis from
1984-1988.

I stand by my opinion that there's nothing quite as visceral as a kick in the ass from a
big honking hunk of iron.  Make mine a rear-wheel drive sports coupe with a big Detroit
V-8, please ;->

Best regards,
