My thought is get SOW on cleric, zone in, aggro the guards (if they aren't KOS
to him), DA and run far away.  Gate out (or perhaps zone out to Marus Seru,
looks doable on the map), log out, log in necro, zone in and loot fast, hoping
the guards havent wandered back yet.  Do necros get FD by that level?  Can you
FD while looting yourself?

It wasn't impossible, but it was certainly disporportionately difficult, and a
very unpleasant surprise.
