Simming is faster than the canoes, *but* when you are on the canoes,
nothing will attack you--stick to the canoes if you are lost and don't
want to risk getting whacked by something that will hurt you bad.  (In
fact, if something is chasing you, and you jump on a canoe and take
command, the thing chasing you will give up, and it will forget that
it is mad at you, and if you jump off the canoe it leaves you alone,
unless you are still near it and it re-aggros) (I wouldn't use this
trick too often...it is probably considered an exploit).
