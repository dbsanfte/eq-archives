Just a word about that necklace so you don't get as disappointed as I 
did when I got it.. The right click root sounded so sweet to me that I 
decided I had to get this. When I got it I realized that the cast time 
on it was 4 seconds which makes it very situational. The ones you have 
in your spellbook are probably much faster in cast something that is 
often quite important when rooting. Still can be fun to do the quest I 
guess, but I wouldn't have bothered if I had known this.

Oh and be sure you can use it when you are done. You probably know this 
already but a friend of mine did the entire quest once only to realize 
that he was a bristlebane druid and only followers of tunare can use it. 
He wasn't very happy but I did my best to cheer him up by making fun of 
him. ;)
