Quote from someone who emailed me (I rarely reply to email):
"castersrealm is wrong the cast time is less than 1 sec I have a ranger and
use it all the time for all sorts of reasons."

Could be they're wrong, but when I looked at the spell (my druid memmed it)
shortly after Luclin came out, I'm pretty sure the spell said the casting
time was 1.8.  I also thought ensnare was 1.8 but it's been so long since
I've specifically looked for that info that I could easily be mistaken.
