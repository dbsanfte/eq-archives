I definitely agree that 95 sucks, but the issue here isn't about that.

The issue is that Verant just pulled the rug from a bunch of users. If 
it's any consolation to the Win95 community I doubt it was deliberate. 
Probably some genius in their dev team start coding to DirectX 8 & 8.1 
interfaces without bothering to check if it actually ran on Win95. I'm 
still not sure *why* they needed to upgrade DirectX anyway. Yes, Luclin 
  benefit, but surely people in the old world could make do with the 
older engine, after all there is still a stable eqgfx_dx7.dll lying around.

Still, it's a mess of their own making and laying the blame on the Win95 
people is the wrong thing to do.
