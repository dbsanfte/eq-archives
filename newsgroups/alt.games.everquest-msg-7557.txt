    It's nice to see they put that much extra effort into this. This could
have been just a "here's what our GM events were" note, but they put a lot
of work into it.

    I wouldn't say the papers are confirmation of a mega-event. Absor had
commented several times on the boards about player complaints that unless
you were PART of a GM event, you really had to work to find out what
happened. And given that some of these events are important parts of what
little evolving storyline EQ has, many players wanted a method of learning
IN GAME about it. Absor said they had something in the works to better
communicate the storyline and history to players. I'd say this was part of
that, and a very welcome part, too.
