Sorry, self-discipline is not a skill.  It is very valuable aid in
learning and applying skills, but it is not a skill.  Now, if you
were so excitable that you needed to exercise calming technique(s)
in order to keep your cool, that exercise would require at least
minimal skill.

I'm willing to accept that there is skill involved in pulling, simply
on the basis that it has required practice to get good at most of the
pulling techniques I've used.

Ok, you've confused me here.  Care to rephrase that so I can reply to
whatever it is you're meaning to say instead of me having to guess?

I disagree completely.

I do agree that it is a requirement for "mastery".
