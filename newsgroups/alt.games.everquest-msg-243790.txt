Just be aware that travel occasionally involves dealing with mobs that
see invis and run at sow speed. Makes corpse runs a serious bitch for
a lot of classes. 

GoD is a pretty hard-core expansion in the sense that you can't really
progress in any of the trials unless you have a good group of 65s
that's can play 4+ hours at a stretch. There's a couple (5?)
non-instanced zones you can hunt in but any zone past the first one is
out of reach of a lvl 65 duo/trio. ... at least if you plan to try the
named mobs that spawn occaionally. In Quinimi (2nd zone in), we ran
across a named that hit for 1250 this weekend as we where passing
through. 

Otoh, even the first zone which is pretty much green/light blue at 65
has decent drops live 20hp augments and a FT1 necklace. 

I haven't spent much time in GoD but it's empty every time we've taken
a group there. I don't ever see people doing GoD in pickup groups,
there's just too many ways to screw up to go in without knowing you
can depend on the people you're with to help out with something like a
complicated corpse run. 

Loot in even the normal GoD zones can border on spectacular, this
weekend we got a fungi with really nice stats and 90hp off of a trash
mob.

It isn't a as much about balance as it is game design. SOE has come
out and stated that they'r going away from high hitpoint/low dps mobs
Now you have mobs that put out insane DPS but die in 30 seconds which
just isn't the type of encounter that a shaman is designed for. Add
slow mitigation and insane MR on top of that and they've made the
shaman class obsolete.
