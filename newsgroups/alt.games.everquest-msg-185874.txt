From the shadows, the mysterious kaev <gaston@nospam.yuck.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Al of the racial armors I have seen stats for have non-diety-specific
>versions.  The Diety specific versions have slightly better stats
>(except for the Rallos Zek version of the human Heraldic armor, which
>is noticeably better for Warriors than any of the others afaik, and is
>wearable by warriors of nearly any race so long as they follow Rallos).
