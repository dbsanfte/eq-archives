Finally got my bard alt up to 40 and am considering 
buying a Lute Of The Howler.  My question is this.  I 
realize that there is a lot of inflation right now but I've 
had 2 people give me the price of 40k this week.  Is 
it really worth it?  Even if the price is high, is this an 
item the will really get some use or just a toy that will 
wind up sitting in the bank or bazaar?

Thanks for your opinions.

Brian
