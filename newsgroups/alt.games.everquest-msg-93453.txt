I'm guessing that you don't solo 100% of the time.
Try looking at who you group with, are they in a guild? Do they seem
"nice" ?
If so ask them if their guild is good and recruting.
This is probably your best bet.

Alternativly www.guildmagic.com lists 90-odd guilds on Seveth Hammer
By searching for level 30-35 mages I found them in these guilds :
Humm I found you listed there twice <G>
So you know about that then.

You could also try http://www.guildworld.com/public/guilds/results.asp

HTH,

Jim
