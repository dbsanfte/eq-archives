Uh, if you can communicate with your tank, you can lull (pacify) and 
they can then pull.  I have found this works about half the time, most 
of the pullers seem to be too stupid to understand that they should wait 
for pacify.  Even a train of 6 mobs can't knock sense into their heads. 
  But if you can find a smart tank, perhaps someone who has played a 
class that casts harmony or pacify, you may be in luck.

Better yet, get a paladin and let them pacify and pull.

I heard that if pacify is resisted you may get agro.  Whether you get 
agro depends partly on your charisma.  So when playing a shaman or 
enchanter I keep charisma buffed on pulling paladins as well as charming 
bards.
