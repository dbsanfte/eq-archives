Apparantly I'm insane, I've played an enchanter and a necro (latter only 
to 24 admittedly) and don't recall seeing this spell for either class.

Again I'll ask, why don't I ever hear of necromancers doing pet canni? 
For mages, this works out to about 136 mana per tic if its really 
boosted up right... are necro and chanter pets that much less efficient 
to cast/reclaim?
