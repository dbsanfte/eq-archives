Sometimes stand somewhere or sitting somewhere when LD isn't fun either. My
troll SK went LD once in Oasis. He was on the dock by that time. So I just
quit and went to sleep. A few days later when I logged back in. My troll was
in East Freeport near zone line. He was bound there. And he was naked. The
corpse turned out to be on the orc high way hidden behind a hill. Thank god
my troll sk has locate corpse :-)
