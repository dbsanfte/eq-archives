Me either!

I use it for the kids' and wife's machines - even the desktops.  My
last house I had custom wired cat5 through the walls before the
dry-wall went up and did that whole "wired-home-weenie-wag' thing :-)
But then I moved... and switched to wifi.  Life is simpler now.  Well,
except for that dead zone above my office where the refrigerator is.
It seems to destroy my signal.  Some day I need to move the WAP, but
just haven't bothered - no bedrooms up above there and it just means I
can't sit with a laptop in the far corner of the living room (which is
probably for the best).
