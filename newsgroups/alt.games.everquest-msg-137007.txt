Since it always seems like the all-rightious Enchanters are
complaining about everyone that does not listen to them,  I thought I
would throw this in.  (humor not sarcasm. They are right 99% of the
time and I dont want to start a fight.)

Last night I was grouped with a lvl 32 chanter who didn't seem to be
mezzing anything successfully at all and was doing some awful
complaining about broken mezzes.  After a heated discussion with our
tank, it turned out that the chanter had made an assist button, was
assisiting our only tank/puller/main-assist  then casting a single
target mezz.

I was happy to see that the leader, once we figured this out, politely
educated him instead of maddly kicking him out.  He did fine as soon
as was told his error and ended up saving us from a serious overpull
about 20 minutes later.

I was refreshed to see patience win out over the easier choice of
disbanding and abandoning.  He's a better player now and we didn't get
slaughtered after abandoning our crowd control.

Still, you gotta wonder, he was lvl 32........

Speaking of starting fights, I think I'll top post this as a new
heading.  It's so rare these stories have a good ending.
