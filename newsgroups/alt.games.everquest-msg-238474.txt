Firstly, I'm not hotwizzard.

Secondly, Frizbee, she did what she wanted, and so did I.  She isn't posting
here because she's probably too busy finding another guy online to cyber
with and get to feel sorry for her so she can call that a "relationship",
too.

And she has no ongoing problem?!  She engages in cyber sex and tries to get
the men to think she regards them as "special".  Then she gives them the ole
"let's just be friends" speech and pretends she knows how to be a friend.  I
wasn't hurt because I lost someone special (really I hadn't, now I see), I
was hurt because I was part of her ongoing game.  Play the man (do him a
favor), oooooooooh get to know me and feel torry for me, give 'em "what they
need", ooooooooh that feel good for you?, then "You don't have to
reciprocate", oh you want to?, OOOOOOH, let's just be friends now, rinse,
repeat with next twit.  All the while a dumbfuck of a husband is at home
wondering why his wife spends so much time in the computer room when he's
not there, and outta the fuggin room when he's there?!  She didn't respect
her husband enough to talk WITH him about important things, she told me as
much.  She enjoyed talking AT him and relishing in how he would storm out of
the room, and then she would tell me about it as it was occurring.  She
ordered a female "toy" for herself (partly in the hope of using it with my
text), and then described to me as it was happening how he walked in and
confronted her with the credit card charge.  She also described how she
bitched him out, and how he subsequently stormed out of the room in anger.
Or how she would tell me about how they had multiple bank accounts and how
it
would be sooooo much easier if we just had one.
Again, why would she think I cared?  How could I change it?  Just another
episode of "How the Whore Turns" I guess.

She has an ongoing problem.  More accurately her husband does and I wanted
to insure he knew it.
I wanted someone to show me EQ, she seemed nice, friendly; I was friendly as
well.  I didn't ask about her husband, and what time he was getting home.  I
didn't ask for her to grab my virtual ass.  She dragged me in, I gave in,
and I was IN.  I was drawn into her life by her, don't tell me I had a
problem and went after her.  I had the problem AFTER I was drawn in.
She told me how she has few friends of her own, and how most of them are
male.
Her husband probably thought I was just
another male friend, and that's all I wanted to be at first.  I just wanted
someone to play the damned game with, I was new.  I wanted her husband to
know she wasn't as innocent as her surname, Angels, but rather more like
"Jezebet" -- far more fitting.
