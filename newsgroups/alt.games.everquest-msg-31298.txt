Same here. I've camped Aviaks for over 3 weeks, but only got 1 Glove of
Rallos Zek (research component for certain mage spells). Thanked a friend on
my knees when he got 2 and gave them to me. Only was able to use one
effectively because of failures :(

What I'm really concerned about is that I can only buy 1 pet at lvl 44, the
fire one which is the less used by me, and I need to research the rest.
Biggest problem is that I first need to research 2 lvl 39 ones and then try
with the results of those to create the lvl 44 ones. With a failure rate of
at least 60% I need a LOT of research components...
