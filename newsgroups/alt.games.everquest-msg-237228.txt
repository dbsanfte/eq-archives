Zeus was a God to the Greeks, and he didn't know what his own wife was
up to three quarters of the time.

The Greeks and Romans didn't even require common sense never mind
omniscience from their Gods, and even most Christians don't require
God to *know* what I'm going to decide to have for lunch today... why
do you insist on it? Particularly in the face that what your insisting
simply doesn't make any logical sense. an omni-god is logically
impossible.

A useful definition of God that avoid omni-paradox is to say that God
is perfect using this particular negative definition of perfect: That
which can not be improved.

The operative word is *be*. If any improvement you suggest logically
cannot *be* (as in cannot logically exist) then God is perfect as he
is.

If you were to say but he's still flawed... I'd have to respond that
its not a 'flaw' if its impossible for anything to logically exist
without it.

This definition neatly address your Q argument. Q can definately stand
some improvement... ergo he's not God.

Most people only require complete and total knowledge of the past and
present. Its certainly sufficient for "moral authority" to judge the
past events to leave the future up for grabs.
