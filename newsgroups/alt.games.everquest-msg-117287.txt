Obviously you don't know how EQ works....

If the original poster used the CD-Keys to open an account and play,
he can "steal" the account back from anyone he sells it to by
contacting Verant. A "good bargain" can quickly turn into a nightmare.
Anyone that is interested in playing EQ should buy a new (unsed) copy
of the game.
