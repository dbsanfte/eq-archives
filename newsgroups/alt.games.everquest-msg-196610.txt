most of the pull with a bard are just from agro in my experience and say you
got chief agro swaped to you
by bard being just to close to you,yes he should of apologized,but he also
should have pulled them away from you any way if you were there first, only
the right thing to do.i got a lvl 51 bard and have never lost my pull unless
others came to close to me and got agro,its just comon sense to pull to
where no one is.or better yet not pull from somewhere people are fighting it
he cant do it safely
