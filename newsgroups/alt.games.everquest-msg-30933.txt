Then why include it?  If it doesn't interest you, chances are it doesn't
interest you.

At level 50+ there are rarely enough clerics.

More or less.  At level 53 I can still solo but the downtime sucks.

No xp penalty.

Rogues are REQUIRED in certain high level zones, and even not in those
zones, any melee group that snubs a rogue doesn't know what rogues can do.

No xp penalty

Again, why bother mentioning it if it sounds boring?  I mean, you didn't
mention druids, shaman, necros, rangers or magicians (errr, I think there's
14 classes but I don't feel like figuring out the 2 I forgot) so I'm
guessing you find THEM boring or not fun either, right?
