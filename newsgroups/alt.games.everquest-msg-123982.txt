Tips for Kelethin...

All the ramps are in a 'tree to tree' straight line... if you run from the
tree at the centre of the platform you're on, to the tree of the platform
you want to go to... even if the ramp is down, and you can't see it... you
should be safe.

Also, try to think of Kelethin as being a string of platforms with Orc Lift
at one end, past PoD lift, to Newbie lift, and on to the Rogue Guild... with
another string going from PoD lift, past bank, to Ranger guild, then Druid
guild.
