OOPS ah i was wrong:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp

"Additional menus are added for those with 256MB of RAM to tune which
models are loaded (among many other options we will be providing),
further increasing performance. For example, you may choose to see the
Troll Male but not the Ogre Female. Fewer new models will reduce the
amount of memory EverQuest requires. "

So if you have 256 meg of ram you can tune which ones are loaded so
its not all or none. Hmm the thing is though look at the before and
after screenshots on that page I posted.

Before:

After:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/screenshots/112101b/EQ000012.jpg

The new and old models kind of gel together. I could really not see
turning some off and some on. 

And this may just change your name about not using the new dark elf
model:

After:

VA VA VOOM!

With all the new models on it really does look like you stepped into a
fully new game, at least as far as Luclin is concerned.

Except for the not yet dressed dark elf, they could say that was EQ 2
and we'd believe them and go "oooh!".
