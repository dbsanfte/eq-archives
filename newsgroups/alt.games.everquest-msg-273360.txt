There is a lot of content that is totally overlooked by people. Go to
northern or central Antonica and you will find large mobs of gnolls,
which people never go after. Yet the Blackbarrow is full of people
killing gnolls .

Half the problem is the way quests are dished out. They are on very
individual bases but require you to find a group but there is no
obvious way too. Ie you get a quest while running around Qeynos harbour
to kill things in the sea but there is no one spot to go and met other
people on the same quests. You can send out ooc or shouts but you just
find the other half of problem is people are all out doing there own
thing and no ones interested. Set the LFG flag and you will probably
only get invites from people grinding away on gnolls or crows.

The only way is often to level up and come back then the creatures are
all grey and you can solo them, minus exp and items of course. If, like
I suggest, SOE change the con colours based on whether you in a group
or solo the creatures and quest will give you exp and items for much
long. But at some point you would have to switch from being in a group
to being solo to get anything out of them.

Another answer would be to do what AO does and give quests out
depending if you are in a group and solo. That way the entire group
gets the same quest at the same time and has their mind set on doing it
but that would still limit the content to solo players, much better to
make it all available.
