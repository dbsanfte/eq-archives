I have this problem when using my laptop. P3 600 8meg ATI Graphics. If I hit
f10 to go to full screen and hit it until I'm back at the interface screen,
everything goes back to normal (i.e. clothed). Don't know why this happens,
but his is what worked for me. BTW, also works for the "everything is
floating" bug.
