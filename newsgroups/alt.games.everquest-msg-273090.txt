Another great post, thanks!  And I'm glad to hear you're sticking around.
(Wish you were on EMarr, but ah well. :-)

As for your problem with the windows, I have to say it: you should've
read the FAQ!  Question 4.4 covers this, and would've told you that the
Monual_drinal.ini has some stuff (including hotkeys), but most of the
character-specific stuff (including windows, /autojoin channels, etc.)
is stored in UI_Monual_drinal.ini.
