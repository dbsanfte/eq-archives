	There are more ways to document this sort of thing than simply
reporting it to the FBI or your local police.

	The fact remains:  No one has ever produced any documentation to
show that EQ passwords are being stolen in the manner you cite.  It is not
impossible for EQ passwords are being stolen in the manner you describe,
but I suspect that it is extremely unlikely.

	Yes, I really do think that they will not bother with small peanuts
like EQ accounts.  Anyone who can perform the type of hackery you describe
is capable of making more money phishing credit card info than he/she ever
could with selling EQ accounts and items on eBay.




>Hey, wallow all you want.

	I do not think that phrase means what you think it means.
