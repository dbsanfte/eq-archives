I'd have to go with this advice, most important (almost) are Dex and Agi, at
least for me, with almost any toon, I never suffer less than 75 in either,
skills just raise too slowly.

Hit points are most important?

I'm entirely unconvinced, I should point out that for the most part I play a
beastlord or a bard, and solo, the beast melees ALL the time, the bard
melees occasionally. I NEVER bother with either Temperance or Virtue as
buffs (actually thats a lie, temp is useful to see you from 1-5 if you can
afford it at that stage). How often are you fighting mobs that reduce you to
zero hit points?

I rarely allow myself to fall below half, if I do, then I shouldn't be
fighting whatever is doing that to me, as it's not an efficient way to get
experience (too much downtime)

It may well be entirely different at the Raid end of the game, but by then
you will be able to max out all your stats with equipment, almost entirely
independently of what class you play... *dons flameproof eyebrows.
