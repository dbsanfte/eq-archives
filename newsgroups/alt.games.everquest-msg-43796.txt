Hmmmm, Mythic says they're not supported, people on the boards
who try to run it on them (and banshee's) experience really bad
framerates, some of them have spent the $60 it takes to get a
Geforce2 mx400 and have reported *substantial* gains in framerate.

Suppose that means they were right?

Personally I dislike 1st person, and have long been unhappy with
the lack up mouse control of your avatar in 3rd person in EQ.  The
rest of the game made up for it in my mind though.  When I finally
get a chance to run this thing through the wringer, a good 3rd person
implementation is certainly going to weigh in it's favor.
