LOL!

"One who makes what is considered an unreasonable profit especially
on the sale of essential goods during times of emergency."

You think wizards and druids made an unreasonable profit selling
ports?!

: by selling a lot more milk than you would have
: otherwise to folks who don't have access to drinking water,

EQ players can get anywhere except a few places without teleports.
Your analogy is fubar.  In essense, drinking water is, and always
has been, available.  It's called walking.

: and
: the local authorities finally get the water system working, do
: you have anything remotely resembling a legitimate complaint?

I'm not sure how to respond to such an obviously unreasonable
analogy.  Perhaps you need to think things through more carefully
before responding.

: Grow up and smell the roses.

I was wondering when you'd start acting like an insulting asshole.
Perhaps it's you that should grow up and attempt to discuss issues
without resorting to being a jackass virtually every time.

: If all being a Druid means to you
: is skinning other players for ports then I've got even less
: sympathy for you than I do for Ingot's pathetic whine.

Teleporting isn't all being a druid means to me.  For you to even
remotely suggest that just makes you further the asshole for
making grand assumptions.

: Go out, get a group, learn how to be one of the few Druids who're
: welcome anywhere there're players with IQs above room temperature.

I never have problems finding groups.  Besides, grouping too much
screws the offense, defense, dodge, and weapon skill of choice for
a druid.  It's almost like SOE wants us to solo, or lag terribly
far behind in those skills.

: It might be hard at times to find players who aren't idiots to

Not only do I not have a problem finding groups, but I never have
a problem finding good groups.

What does PoP teleports have to do with groups anyway?

: Once you're a credit to your class go find

I'm already in one of the best groups of FV.  I love my guild.

What does PoP teleports have to do with guilds anyway?

: By then you'll be too busy having
: fun to engage in bullshit whining like you did here.

But think of all the entertainment you'd miss!

1. You wouldn't get to whine about other people's whining.

2. You wouldn't get to be insulting every chance you get.

3. You wouldn't get to make bizarre off topic comments (i.e.,
   "Teleporting is now worth less."  "So, get a group."  HUH?)

Nah, thanks for the suggestion, but I'll whine anytime I want,
whether you like it or not.  After all, watching you act all
superior and condescending when you're an obvious fuckwit is
terribly enjoyable!

Try taking your head out of your ass sometime, Kaev.
