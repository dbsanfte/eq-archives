Magelo is fine on my end ( USA ). 
From Magelo FAQ:

I'm having problems with the site, how do I fix them? 

7 times out of 10 it's IE's cache at fault. Simply clear your cache and try again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO CLEAR IE'S CACHE 

Click on the Tools menu and select Internet Options. Click Delete Files then OK.
That's it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure you're using IE 6, Mozilla 1 or Netscape 7. Opera 7 reportedly works, too.
But other browsers simply don't cut the mustard (yet). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


And from Jelan's own post:

Internet Explorer 6 

There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order: 

- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft
(Tools -> Windows Update -> Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least
once a week for maximum compatibility. 

- Make sure Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced -> Use HTTP1.1 through proxy
connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON. 

- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or
custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to
medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be
acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit. 

- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy
settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or
Norton HOWTOs in the library). 

- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old
page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -> Internet Options -> Delete
Files. 

- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -> Internet Options
-> Settings -> Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you
to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else. 

- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools ->
Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?) 


Internet Explorer 5 & 5.5 

Your Mileage May Vary, as they say. Those old browsers are less secure, less capable
and less compliant with current internet and web standards. If you can get either to
work with Magelo, great, but don't expect that to continue. We move with the times.
New techniques allow us to provide better, more interactive features efficiently. 

Always stay up to date and you'll be fine. Because by staying with an outdated
browser you are reducing the size of the web you can use. Change or fossilize.
