I figure that due to the vaguaries of the random system any answer will
involve a +/- 10% and YMMV so I doubt that it matters a whole hill of
beans.

I guess that if you had to make a 1000 of some trivial item for some
insanely masochistic reason then the difference between a 95% and 98%
sucess could make a difference, but for any normal player, even any
normal Grand master trade skiller I really can't see the point in
arguing about a % difference that will be eaten up by the RNG.

Nice to know aproximatly what your chances are for non trival combines,
but once you get past the "I have a one in three chance of making that
250 triv item" it kind of becomes meaning less, IMOSHO.

However I would never want to discourage the anal qualities of the
tradeskilling community, afterall thats the only way that us mortals
find out about new recipies etc.
