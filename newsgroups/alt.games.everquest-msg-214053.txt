This makes sense now, thanks.  As a side note, excited to get EQ/AM3,
I stopped at 59, went 90% AA, and got EQ/AM2.  At 62 I went ahead and
got AM3.  Those AA's did help a bit with grouping.  In fact it isn't
uncommon at all that if a non-level-65 ranger goes LFG in BoT, people
will only take him if he is a hunter.
