On a related note....

EQ has thousands of quests in the game. But most of them are hopelessly
broken or outdated. What quests are left in the game that get you a reward
(gear or spell) that's worth the effort? Assuming you did all the
camping/tradeskilling/etc yourself (solo, in group, or in raid), rather
than buying all the components off merchants, in the bazaar, or getting
your L65 druid to camp the mobs for you? Assuming you did the quest when
you still got xp for the mobs? You know, the type where you hand in the
items, press the Give button, and Wowza! you get an item you can't *wait*
to equip?

IMO:
most newbie armors are pretty good
probably a fair number of the PoK focus item quests
testament of vanear
stein of moggok
sol ro mage focus items, eye of zomm bracelet
staff of temperate flux
froglok wizard improved damage 2 belt
OT hammer
JBoots
rallic pack
wizard concussion spell

Anything else? Ghoulbane? Trueshot Bow? I haven't gotten beyond the low
40's yet, so my knowledge of the higher level quests is pretty sketchy.
Surely there must be an epic or 2 still worth the effort (cleric? mage?
druid? rogue?)? Hollowshade Moor war? But surely most of the prayer shawls,
coldain rings, qeynos badges, solro gear (and iksar equivalents) are pretty
weak compared to what you can buy in Bazaar for less than 100pp.
