	You are indeed using bad logic.

	" The player base experenced its greatest growth during the 
Velious expansion.  Growth slowed down after the next expansion added
magic transport.  Therefore adding magic transport slowed the growth
of the player base."

	That's a classic example of faulty reasoning: "It came after there-
fore was caused by."  Your error is that you fail to eliminate other
reasons for slower growth, such as competition from other games, market
saturation, bad pricing models, and so on.

	Exactly.  There is no real evidence either way to support
or disprove the claim that adding POK books hurt the game signiifigantly.

	I think that what REALLY hurt and is hurting the game is lack
of any attention to quality.  They dont' care about providing a quality
gaming service:  look at the downtime and connect issues.  They don't
care about providing quality customer support: how many days does it
take to get a meaningless answer?  They don't care about providing a quality
product:  look at the unfixed serious bugs and omissions.  And they
don't care about providing quality content:  it's less expensive to use
all the same models, textures, maps, and "plots", so that's what they do.
THOSE issues are hurting the game both in terms of keeping and attracting
players.


>again, you like many of your ilk confuse "downtime" with "doing
>anything but grinding".

	No.  I simply refuse to agree that holding the W key for 10 minutes
is anything BUT downtime.
