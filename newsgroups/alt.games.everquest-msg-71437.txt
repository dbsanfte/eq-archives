Same thing happened to me Ben.   The bad part about my death at the hands of
Jenhadar is that it took place opening night for Luclin.   Clerics where
very scarce that night and I was barely able to talk one into following me
through 2 "new" zones to Rez me.  "But I died in a safe newbie zone!"
hehe... they were suspicious.   Then to top it all off, I had dragged my
corpse to the Shadeweavers/Paludal zone line for the Rez and after getting
the rez, I forgot to loot the last "junk" item on my corpse.  I zoned into
paludal and went on exploring in other zones for the next few days not
realizing I left a corpse in a newbie zone.  Kept getting "You died in a
newbie zone? giggle" tells for 4 days till I got back there and disposed of
the body. ;-/
