for mages:

1: pets often lead out with a spell - long before you can hit
/pet back off

2: I do not, repeat NOT want to be the rampage tank, thank you
very much :-P

3: If it's an air pet and it stuns the mob when the AE hits him,
I just pulled aggro off the MT and the mob charged over towards
us casters - not a good place for it.
