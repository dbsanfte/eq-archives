Yeah, that's what I was presuming...

On the other hand, it's possible (but probably not likely) for
the keys to be set up in such a way that applying the trilogy/gold
key to an existing "classic" key would simply unlock the additional
expansions.

There's no way to be sure without trying it.  But I wouldn't
count on it working.
