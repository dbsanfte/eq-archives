I am Srie, just Srie, it is the name my mother gave me. I need no
title, and I desire no surname. I have steel, my wit, and platinum,
what else should I require?

With platinum you can buy honor, look at the Knights of Truth. Why
would I want a title?

I understand I can't turn off a cursed surname. Why is that so?
