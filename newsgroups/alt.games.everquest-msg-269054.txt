It's pretty trivial to solo a warrior through the mid 50s these days.
Up through 50th lvl, it was probably more efficient to solo than group
with him. After 50 it would probably have been slower but I know CoM
would have gotten me through the high 50s at a decent rate. You can
mow through low lvl blues there as a melee.
