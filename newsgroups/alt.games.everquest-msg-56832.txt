IIRC has been around a loooooooooong time. It's been one of the usenet
standards for years. It means "If I Recall (Remember) Correctly".
"Mob" (no funky caps) refers to a NPC enemy, and is short for
"mobile". It originates back in the MUDs of old. "Aggro" is from
aggressive. If something attacks you, it becomes aggressive towards
you...hence, it "aggros" you.
