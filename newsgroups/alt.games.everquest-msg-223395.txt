Yeah. That would make a big difference. There's always *somebody* 65th 
level, alone, and looking for easy cash. :)

Even here, never saw any unpleasantness about the camp, people were 
pretty polite, but *every few minutes* during prime time someone would 
log in, camp check.. .and get the GEOS CAMPED!!! response 0.2 seconds 
later...and then leave... so its a really popular camp... and probably 
never spends more than 5 minutes empty... which would make snagging it 
on most servers probably a waste... spend all that time running from GD 
and through EW with a very small chance of scoring the camp.... :)
