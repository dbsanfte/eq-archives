As an update on this I am trying to produce a definative list of who can
be what etc.
I have posted some stuff to the thread about a good duo for FV.
I'm still having some trouble ironing out all of the kinks.

Still here is what I think I have worked out about the xp bonus.
Note that this is 100% guess work based on Brad's comments :

	OG	NG	DG	ON	NN	DN	OE	NE	DE
OG	++	+	==	+	==	-	NO	NO	NO
NG	+	+	+	==	==	==	NO	NO	NO
DG	==	+	++	-	==	+	NO	NO	NO
ON	+	==	-	+	==	-	+	==	-
NN	==	==	==	==	==	==	==	==	==
DN	-	==	+	-	==	+	-	==	+
OE	NO	NO	NO	+	==	-	++	+	==
NE	NO	NO	NO	==	==	==	+	+	+
DE	NO	NO	NO	-	==	+	==	+	++

In the table each +/- is about -/+ 2%
NO means can't group and == means no bonus/penalty.
Based on the fact that the max bonus would be equivelent to a full group
bonus.
i.e. all are OG = ++ * 5 = about 20%

Thus a group of OG,OG,NG,DG,NN,DN gives

OG = ++,+,=,=,- or +4%
NG = +,+,+,=,= or +6%
DG = =,=,+,=,+ or +4%
NN = =,=,=,=,= or 0%
DN = -,-,=,+,= or -2%

HTH,

More to follow,

Jim
