Well, various reasons;

1) there is always something better anyway,
2) quests can be fun,
3) Lambet armor looks cool (even cooler than my newbie bard quest stuff)
4) I'll get more chat up lines from chicks that like my new cool armour
(guys are wasting their time {:-),
5) I'm poor,
6) farming plat is exceedingly boring,
7) prices in the bazaar are a wank
8) I'm a hypocrite and will gladly take 1pp for snake skin and other
bazzar pumped prices ( a fool and their money are soon parted,
especially lazy fools),
9) I do not have any expansions packs and are not going to waste the
money on buying them, unless I win the lottery before my subs run out,
10) so, I don't have access to the bazzar,
11) EQ totally looses is value if you approach it simply approach it as
an money economy exercise,
12 It is more fun this way.
