    Yup. And while the server's top guild (not much of a top guild in the
scheme of things, but they've had their server-wide firsts) is JUST starting
to "feel out" Aaryonarr, the "gimp" guilds are in PoM farming it for the
superior armour with less risk. I think I know who the "gimps" are: the ones
who aren't in PoM yet.
