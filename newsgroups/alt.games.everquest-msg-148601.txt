}Trees and rocks won't (usually) block AE, but landscape still can.

Best thing to block it with is probably distance.  Dragon roar has a pbAoE 
range of 300.  Which is just further than the casting range of 
most detrimental spells.  Slows run about 250, so if you have Imp. Range 
and you can get slow to start casting, you're too close. :)

Recast time on Dragon roar is 36 sec.  Have the MA call them, and run in 
between roars, cast, and flee again.
