It will cost you 50 dollars to transfer one character from his account to
your account, and 25 dollars for each character after that.  Go to
www.everquest.com, one of the boxes halfway down the page says 'character
transfer service'.  Click it and follow instructions.  I did this for my
second account.  I had one account with a plus 50 shaman and a plus 50
enchanter, and my brother had quit the game a little while ago.. I restarted
his account and then transfered my enchanter to it so I could play him and
my shaman together.  I also transfered my cleric to the second account for
rezzes, so it came out to 75 bucks.  A 100 percent profit for sony, as it's
a totally automated system of taking one 'character' object and attaching it
to another account, but what are you gonna do, it's the price you gotta pay
if you want it.
