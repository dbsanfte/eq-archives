Level 13 took forever and a day. When I finally dinged 14 and scribed
Spirit of Wolf and Bind Affinity I was bouncing off the walls. I
remember at 14 or 15 someone paying me 15pp (!!!) to bind them by the
gnome in WFP. That was a huge amount of cash to me. Level 19 was a lot
of fun too -- the freedom to go places!

Level 29 was the next big milestone. Group ports! Cash! A day or two
after I dinged 29 someone in LOIO offered me 100pp to come to the
windmill and port him somewhere. Twenty-nine was probably the level
where I felt I had "arrived".

Level 60 was less a milestone and more "thank the gods it's over".
