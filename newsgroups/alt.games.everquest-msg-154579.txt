}(1) Does poison making count as a trade skill for the "one
}grandmaster" clause? I've already got a 210 in fletching.

From what I hear, no.  Supposedly a gnome rogue could be 250 posion, 250 
tinkering, 250 one other.

}(2) Are there poison-making Geerlocks?

No.  There is, however, a Grandmaster's Seal.

}(3) Are there any droppable +make poison items out there?

Yup.

Note also that posionmaking can supposedly be raised well past 21 by 
spending training points.
