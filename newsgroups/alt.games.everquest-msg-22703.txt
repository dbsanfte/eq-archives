It is a limitation of the pathing engine.  This is a VERY common form
of pathing bugs.  Anyone who's played for any length of time with even
the tiniest bit of common sense can pretty much figure out that taking
advantage of this IS an exploit.

Consider:  In many higher level zones, the mobs are coded to not even
bother pathing around water/lava/whatever.  They are specifically
coded to just teleport to your current location.

Infact why the hell do you think Verant specifically gave the ability
of level 51+ mobs to summon your sorry ass across the zone?  As
annoying as that is, it's a simple fix to the limitation caused by the
pathing engine.
