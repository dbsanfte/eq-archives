Without testing, my feeling based on years of play experience is that 
this is not the case, that, in particular, Stun and Root were resisted 
no more than higher level stuns and roots; I used both these spells a 
LOT because they cast faster and used less mana, and did the same job as 
the higher level versions.

In particular, Stun seemed to be resisted LESS than say Holy Might or 
other cleric stuns.  I'm told this is because the other stuns have a 
damage component and give the mob a second chance at a resist.  Don't 
know how true that is.

I do know that some mobs gave a message saying they were immune to the 
spell I was casting, for a low level stun, but were stunnable by a high 
level one.  Immune, however, is not the same as resist.

I think, insofar as resist goes, that the only factors are your level 
relative to the mob's level, innate resists for the mob, buffs for the 
mob, and any resist modifier the spell itself has; this last is among 
the data that Lucy captures for us to see.
