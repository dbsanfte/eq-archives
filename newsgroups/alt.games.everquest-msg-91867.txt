People ask this kind of stuff a lot, and the answer, "it
depends," seems clichï¿½, but it's really true. But first,
class is way more important than race. As to what classes
suit what play styles,

If you want to be in demand for exp groups, choose:
Cleric, Enchanter, Bard, or maybe Shaman

If you want to be able to solo, choose:
Necromancer, Druid, Shaman (at higher levels), Enchanter (at
higher levels), or maybe Monk (if you prefer melee to
casting and medding)

If you want an easy epic, choose:
Rogue, Monk, or maybe Shaman

If you want to be in demand for raids (at higher levels),
choose:
Cleric, Bard, Rogue, Monk, or Wizard

The main reason to choose a one race over another once
you've picked your class is to get nightvision, favorable
faction (makes traveling much easier), and a look that you
like.

You can't really go wrong with Barbarian Shaman if that's
something you're leaning toward.
