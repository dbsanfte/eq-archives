I asked a similar question earlier and was VERY confused by the answer. Let 
me ask in layman terms without using astro physics and analytical geometry 
to solve it.

When I have 2 items (say shields) and:
 one has a shield factor of 45 and the description says you are grossly 
overqualified for this item and is grey.
and the other one is shield factor of 12, but I have just begun to 
understand this items potential and is orange.

Which one offers more protection (overall).

And yes, they both are same in all other qualities.

Additionally, is there or do we ever see a day where the will be a stat on 
our personal or inventory screen that would show our overall shield level, 
so we could mix and match and determine the best armor assembly.

Just this Palladian's 2G 5S 47C.
