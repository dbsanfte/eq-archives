There's ways around the bind sight nerf (Don't disband my guild
please!!!) but the sad fact is, other than monk boots, monk staff and a
few Phara drops, it isn't worth going for the risk/reward. We went last
weekend for a bit of fun. Everything died first attempt apart from
botched pulls. Siverwing dropped a Lifetap Scim and everyone who could
use, had better. It's now gathering dust in someone's vault. Very sad...
