Do you actually lose anything when you fail?  The first
Ixi fight I was ever in (as a 51 mage) we wiped.  But we
ressed back and took him 3 more times, 1 time for each
cleric who needed it.

As an addendum - Mala has very low aggro.  The entire
Malxxxx line is fairly low aggro, as compared to Tash.

As a mage it is very common to pull with the Mal line,
as it is very easy for the pet to grab aggro from you.
