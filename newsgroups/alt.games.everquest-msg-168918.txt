Harmtouch won't gauarantee a way out of a jam, but sure gives him a fighting
chance.  Once a rogue get's aggro'd alone, he has nothing to fall back on to
get out of trouble.

Ahhhhh I see, so the trick is to get them to turn around.  Throw a pebble
into the bush and they turn around and I tiptoe by.  Damn! I never thought
of that.

I don't get your question.  You mean that a limitation is only a limitation
if no other class has the same limitation?  Is it the same way for benefits?
Does that mean that FD is NOT really a benefit to a Monk because Necro's
have it too?  Healing is not an ability because there are several classes
that can do it?  I never thought of it that way.  So you are saying that
rogues are overpowered because they have abilities that no other class has?
hmmmmm at least now I can see where this came from.
