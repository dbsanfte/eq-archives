Yes.

}There are many many MANY more ways to teach tolerance.

Aye, I'm not saying you shouldn't use those -as well-.

}And all of them are better suited for such a young age...

All right, so when should we teach them that HIV+ kids are people too?  
When they're, what, 12?  20?  30?

Nobody is forcing your child to watch Sesame Street.  If you, as an 
informed parent, object to the values that it teaches, and has -always- 
taught, like tolerance, there's always Teletubbies, or Barney.  Shame your 
kid will sing all the wrong words to traditional songs, but we can't have 
everything.
