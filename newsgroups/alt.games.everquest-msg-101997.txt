This is the kind of answers (debates, guesses) that I already
have from discussions in the game. I'm looking for a verified
list.

Eqatlas, I should note, is provably inaccurate on the question of
what is and isn't an outdoor zone or a dungeon. In some cases
just doesn't address the point. Eqatlas doesn't directly address
the new exp bonuses at all, but I wouldn't expect it to, they are
only a week old.

So....I guess we gotta start building such a list.

Please reply here with a report of any zone which you believe
from your _own_ play has a new exp bonus from the recent major
patch. No secondhand reports, please -- just firsthand testing
based on having spent time in that zone both before and after the
patch. If you aren't completely sure, that's fine, just say so;
the important thing is firsthand experiences only. If you think
you know somebody who has tested a zone for this, get that person
to report their own results here, rather than report them
secondhand yourself.

I'll tabulate the responses, summarize them, and post that back
to the newsgroup. Where there isn't clear consensus about a given
zone, I'll note that, and perhaps that will inspire further
testing to clarify it.

I could send the list we generate to everlore and eqatlas and
other website moderators too, if they are interested. Ought to be
useful to players.
