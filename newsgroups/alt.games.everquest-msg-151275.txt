Well, the *most* bang-for-the-buck is to go to www.everquest.com,
and click on the "IGN" icon on the lower left.  After giving
your email address, you'll get a free "account key" (the necessary
item for starting up an Everquest account), *and* a link
that lets you download "Classic Everquest" (also for free).

So for $0.00, you can be up and running (presuming you have
a broadband internet connection, since the "Classic Everquest"
files are 450MB and would be a nightmare on a dial-up).

The downside is that this only includes the "original three
continents" -- it does not include Kunark, Velious, or Luclin
(the three expansions beyond the "original" Everquest lands),
and you would have to buy these separately to get the "full"
game.

And in any case you'd have to start paying the $12.95/month
online fee after the first free month is up (which is also
true if you buy the game, the box sets come with a free
initial month and a subsequent $12.95/month fee -- and
that fee is "flat", no matter how many expansions you've
purchased and enabled).

Unless you're on a really limited budget (or wanting to do
a "just a trial"), I'd advise the "trilogy" or "gold" packs,
as others have suggested.  And I'm not sure whether it's
possible to use the trilogy/gold starter packs to "expand"
the freebie "classic" account (although it *is* possible to
use an "add-on" expansion pack to do so).
