I started this twisted Dark Elf Rogue who worships Bristlebane, a
halfing god. I have no idea why, but it IS a good practical joke!
Maybe thats the funny part.

I find there are only a few places I am KoS. NFP, EFP, WFP and all of
Neriak are ok for me except for a few NPCs. Where else would I be KoS?
Please except Cabilis, I know anyone is KoS there. Do the Elves
automatically hate me in Faydark? Are the people in Rivervale KoS to
me? Are Qeynos and Odus safe?
