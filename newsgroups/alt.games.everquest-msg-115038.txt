Use traceroute or some similar tool to check out potential servers, if you
are going to play on more than one.  Verant uses (or used to...haven't
checked to make sure they still do) more than one ISP.  Often, when there is
a network problem such as widespread LD, it only affects the servers
connected through one of the ISPs.

If server "foo" has server number X, you can traceroute to it using either
foo.everquest.com or eqworld-X.989studios.com.  E.g., The Nameless is
thenameless.everquest.com or eqworld-41.989studios.com.
