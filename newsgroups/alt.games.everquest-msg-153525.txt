You may be right.  On the other hand, having read the full text of
their message, you may also be wrong (no bets please).  They claim
that they will be reducing the HP totals of a bunch of mobs as part
of this tuning, specificly because their HPs were previously balanced
for mod rods.  We'll see how it all comes out in the wash.  Who knows,
by the time I manage to finagle my way into a high-end raid or two
perhaps VI will have actually fixed things so the fights are at least
a little bit interesting, instead of just (1) establish agro, (2) get
the CHeal chain running, (3) wait a very long time and pray that you
don't get a MassiveLag add before the mob drops.  (Yes, I know I'm
simplifying things, but, from what I hear from those who do these
fights, not by very much in most cases).
