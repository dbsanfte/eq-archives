The best authority I have found on this, is Paul
Hume. The original word in Hebrew is 'makesofha'
which would be a feminine version of a
'practitioner of enchantments'

To those pagans who have any Qabalistic training
at all, it is spelt Mem Kaph Shin Peh Heh. As it
is from Exodus, gematria may prove revealing.
