They changed the expiration time to be significantly longer I believe.

The best way is to use the email your server GM link on the website.  I 
have done that twice, and they got back to me within 2 or 3 days in both 
cases.  Most of the time, petitioning in game is sufficient, but, if it 
requires an actual GM rather than a guide, then, you are probably best 
off to use the email route, and have some patience.
