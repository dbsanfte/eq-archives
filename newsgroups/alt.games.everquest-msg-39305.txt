Some vendors will always charge you higher prices and give you less money
for what you sell them.  Tubal Weaver at the Qeynos gate is an example of a
merchant who will always rip you off, while Captain Rohand in South Qeynos
is one of the more generous merchants in town.  This has nothing to do with
faction and charisma.

But I've noticed another factor.... over time, if I'm playing a very long
session, even without any faction hits or changes to my charisma, many
merchants will adjust their prices.  If I go to Sneed Galliway too often,
for example, I'll notice he'll start giving me less money for those fire
beetle eyes than what he did earlier in the day.  Then I notice that many of
the other merchants in the same zone will have also adjusted their prices
toward me... most will pay me less, but a few who used to slight me will
suddenly be paying me more.

I've noticed the same thing happening in Freeport and Halas as well.

I suspect that it is merely a tool to get you to explore the city a little
more, and not to always rely on one favorite vendor.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Another factor if you're playing on Sullon Zek......
It seems many of the merchants are coded to prefer certain teams.  Sneed
Galliway in Qeynos was one of my favorite merchants on other servers.  But
suddenly, when I started playing a Good character on SK, he was ripping me
off, despite my faction with him.  I suspect that he gives Neutrals much
better good deals.
When I moved my Sullon Zek character up to Halas, I found that the merchants
in the Shaman's guild were giving me much better prices than what I was
expecting, despite having only mediocre faction.
