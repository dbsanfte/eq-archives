I took my 37 wiz there (main, not an alt), and found ONE mob that conned 
red to me and ready to attack...everything else was red but indifferent.  
(I forgot the  mob, but he was named, and *IS* involved in a quest for 
something, just didn't write the details down and forgot them over 
night).  I was going to take my rogue over to sneak-hide past them, but 
if it's a dead end it pretty much ends the curiosity.  On a side note, on 
the way there, a green-to-me skeletin thing agro'd and followed me al the 
way to the mob that was kos to me, then all the way back to the place he 
picked me up (roughly half way to/from the PoK book to the Unknown Zone).  
he kept casting something that I resisted, but each time I stopped to 
gate, he caught up and hit me (max was for 20 or something like that).  I 
didn't bother to kill him, and there was no one else in zone to train, so 
I just kept running.  That's what curiosity gets me into sometimes, hehe.

Well, thanks for the info, and I'll try to find more stuff to explore 
that won't run into a dead end.

Later
