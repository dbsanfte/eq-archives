Once again, this is apparently several days (?) after original post so I
don't have it to reference...  Sorry for tagging this onto the end of yours
Tim...

And, when push comes to shove, Ranger spells are nothing spectacular to
begin with.  I agree that lvl 30 is a fine level for it.  As others have
pointed out, about twice the levels that Druids get theirs makes perfect
sense.  As for being able to Bind, heck, why not let Warriors have bind too?
Everyone has bind and therefore nobody has to ever worry about Corpse runs.
No thanks.  How reckless would people play if they could all be bound
wherever they travel?

So, to the original poster, you have to realize that every class has it's
benefits and detractions.  Rangers can track from Day 1.  That alone is a
HUGE deal in my eyes.  Rangers can dual wield and double attack.  We can
crit with a bow.  We can do a whole lot of really cool things that other
classes cannot do.  I realize that Warriors get the weapon benefits and
Druids eventually get track as well, but no other class to my knowledge gets
all of these things...  If you are a Ranger depending upon your spells, you
might want to rethink the way you are playing your character.  Our spells
are weak in relation to our other abilities...

Sorry, I'm not sure where I'm going with this, other than to say that if
being able to SoW and bind is such an issue with the original poster,
perhaps you should become a Druid's pet (like myself...hehe) or play a
different class.  I've never had a problem finding a SoW or a bind or even a
port for that matter.  I try to throw plat at the person who assists me, and
most of the time the plat is refused.

Just enjoy the benefits the Ranger does get and Happy Hunting!
