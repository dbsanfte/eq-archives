Don't forget '/report Kudelanthehated' right after that.

I'll have to hijack the "No, I do that for free. It's a hobby." line though,
it's good.

Also, saying "what?" when he hit his hail button was a mistake, usually I
just play AFK w/o tag until they go away, and half the time I'm not playing
since I'll port into WC and go to the bathroom or get a drink while I'm
loading.

WC is my least favorite place to port into, there's ALWAYS some dimwit
standing there with one of four things hotkeyed:  "sow plz", "can u port
me", "can i get some buff plz" or "ne1 have pp for me?"

I prefer Misty Thicket since there's a bank close, although back when I was
level 19-28 I used Erudin to bank.

Some assling dr00d was PBAoE kiting (we ain't talking no quadding here sirs)
in the Grey, he had about 35 skelly/snakes following him around, and he took
special time out to yell at me for having Hierophant Grazan (with necklace)
on root/rot, claiming that he had the Hierophant in his swarm, then
harassing me about it for about a half hour, until I left the zone (and not
because he was a dumbass), at which point he said something to the effect of
"Oh yeah, leave the zone n00b, you can't handle it here." followed
immediately by "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so mean to n00bies like you,
you're forgiven, it's not like you know what you're doing, oh, BTW,
/ignore".  At this point I was actually relived, because it meant that he
wouldn't be bothering me any more.  And all this just to help a friend of
mine who didn't know how to get to/hunt in The Grey.

Personally though, I thought it was fairly humorous when my pseudo ignoring
him ended earlier on in his tirade, he had been yelling at me, then said
"reply now or I petition you" to which I replied "smart", probably confused
the hell out of him, as well as my using big words, such as his response to
"why do I have to justify my actions to you?" being "??", as well as him
blatantly ignoring my remark of his "logical ineptness"

Although, the name Heebiejeebies should've been a big fat "STAY THE HELL
AWAY - MORON HERE" flag initially anyways.
