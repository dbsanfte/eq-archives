Just tried logging in after new patch. Servers are screwed up.

Mass reports of:

Freeport guards spamming at high speed, disconnecting people.

Luclin Portals not working

Ships are flyign through the air.

Reports of a Bixbie Army sieging major Cities in Norath are yet to be
confirmed though...:)
