Very odd...

Maybe they are having to reboot instance servers regularly? (Biggest 
disaster in an SoE game, and afaik has not changed yet, was that they 
had to reboot the SWG servers Every Single Day after they went live. 
Every morning at 6 am CST (I use CST because that's what I'm on) or so, 
all servers go down, then come back up in random order one at a time. 
The random order was because Wanderhome was starting to revolt always 
being down till 8:30 CST or so.

Mind you, I don't play that game anymore, so things may have changed.) 
Anyway it might be something like that.
