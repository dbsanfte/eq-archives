Interesting, somewhat, though irrelevant.

So the bottom line is you would like some advance notice of patches? If I'm 
not mistaken, they *do* normally post a notice on EQLive. I don't normally 
know of them, but that's because I don't check it.

As far as running three times as long as scheduled goes, it happens. No, 
it's not preferable or convenient, but it's certainly not due to 
incompetence imho.
