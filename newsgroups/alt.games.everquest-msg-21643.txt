Petition with your plans, and ask if a guide/GM can be scheduled to show
up and change your surnames. They will also need to know if they are
performing the ceremony.

You'll need to arrange for someone to do the ceremony, provide
refreshments (wedding cake and drinks), and possibly some tinkered
fireworks. Some folks even pick special outfits in which to marry. For
the ceremony, if a friend is doing it, make sure they work with you to
write a meaningful ceremony. You should also try to arrange for ports
for your friends- hire someone to be in set zones at set times to
deliver your friends to the wedding. If you are getting married in a
dangerous but beautiful place, you may want to arrange for body guard
party to circle your group and keep you healthy.

Hope this helps,
