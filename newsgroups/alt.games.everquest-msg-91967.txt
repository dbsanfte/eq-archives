Bzzzt! Thanks for playing. You can skill up on failures too. The quickest 
way to learn baking for example is to go buy a couple of backpacks full of 
fresh fish and a couple full of batwings and make fish rolls (trivial 135) 
until your wrists hurt, despite the fact that you'll fail virtually all of 
them for the first 80 skill points or so.

You can skill up on whichever recipes you like, just the closer the trivial 
is to your skill level the more likely you are to succeed, which is 
important for things like jewellery where you can make back most of your 
costs for a successful combine selling it back to a vendor. But if money's 
no object it would be possible to go from 1-250 on Velium Blue Diamond 
bracers. Just would cost quite a bit :)
