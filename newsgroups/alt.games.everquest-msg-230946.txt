Using an expansion requires two things: installing the expansion
software on your PC, and registering the CD account key.

Your account will still be enabled for all the expansions you
previously registered.  You won't ever need the CD key numbers
again.

If you removed the software from your PC, you'll have to re-install
the game and all the expansions, of course.
