I know exactly what you are going through but be assured that my
experience has been that only one out of every 10 or so will be like
that guy you described. most of the drive by buffing/healing/sowing I
do is met with gratefulness, a return buff, or a cheer and a smile.
That's enough for me. (Of course there's the level 9 gnome who shouted
me a marriage proposal when I saved him from the jaws of a Centurion
but that's another story ;)   Example: Last night I sowed and buffed
and healed two different people sitting at the Freeport gate. One of
them "Hail"ed me as I headed towards the bank and asked for more buffs
"buff me" 
"erm, I already did"  
"more"  "that is all I have, sorry" (I'm level 29 so a heal/sow/damage
sheild/skin like steel is pretty much the limit of my ability at the
moment. However a level 29 sow and a skin like steel is a pretty nice
buff for a level 10 warrior in Freeport.
/em leaves greedywarrior_01 and heads to the bank

The other person said nothing, I figured they were afk and would have
a nice treat waiting for them in their buff window when they came
back.

Twenty minutes later I'm in a zone across Norrath and I receive a tell
from a name I don't know-  "thank you very very much".  I scroll back
in my chatbox and sure enough it was the level 12 enchanter I'd sowed
at the gates who was afk. :)
