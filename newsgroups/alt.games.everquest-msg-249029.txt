Let me just quote a bit....

"We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years,
and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time
to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost
listening to you."

Anyone else see the problem with that?

How do you listen when there are no GMs? How do you CONVINCE us that
you are listening when a petition takes 2-4 DAYS to get answered.

How can we trust you when you say (circa Feb 2002), "Q: Will the
effort and resources required to maintain the new service detract at
all from the basic EverQuest servers? // A: Absolutely not--in fact,
it's just the opposite."

... and then remove most of the GMs within the next 6 months!?!

Want to convince us that you're listening? Hire 1 GM for every server
and swing-shift them so that they can cover all of the servers 24/7.
Next, build a queue management tool for GMs that's cross-server and
let them interact through cross-server chat so that they don't have to
log in to a server to address issues.

If you do that, I will sing the praises of EQ support to everyone I
can find. Until then, I can't recommend the game to my friends, and
that makes me really want to go play WoW when it comes out.
