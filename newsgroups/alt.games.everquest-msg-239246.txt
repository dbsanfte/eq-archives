Perhaps I mistunderstood you, perhaps I overreacted - Mea culpa.

My only defense is I'm still pissed as hell that I made plans with
some people to play Thursday and get through trial 2 in GoD and they
completely wasted it for me, one by not showing up until over an
hour and a half after our planned start time, and the others for
pulling the "oh, just wait, he said he'd be on in a bit" Shtick.  At
the same time there was a very competent tank from our old guild
(and a good guy all 'round) LFG, and they completely refused to consider
going with him.
