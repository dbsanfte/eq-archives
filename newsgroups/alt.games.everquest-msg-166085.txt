I have had the same problem of late as well.  I had just installed the
latest on Earthlinks systems programs as well.  One of which monitors
connecttion activity as part of the anti virus system.  Everytime it went
active, EQ went flakey.  I dumped the programs, went back to the older
Mindspring formats,  and the problem went away.  Also, since I installed
Ad-aware and did a sweep of my system for those bad pop ups, That redused in
game failures as well.  You may want to check if you have a virus or active
hidden pop up program on your drive.
