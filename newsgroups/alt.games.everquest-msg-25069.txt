Actually Kith, Runneye and Befallen are prime examples of why this is not a
dynamic world, they were changed by forces outside of the game and in the
case of Befallen changed back without the players in the game being able to
do anything about it.  If it were a truly dynamic world players actions
would have a lasting effect on the game and they don't, all you can do is
kill a pile of mobs log off come back on and kill the same mobs again until
you move on and repeat the process elsewhere.

As for GM events being opportunities for roleplaying that too is a joke.
Basically, they are either opportunities for GMs to take unbeatable mobs and
kill everyone in sight as many times as they can or opportunities for idiots
to kill the GMs who are attempting to create a true roleplaying event and a
reason to jam a zone so heavily that it crashes and takes down all the zones
around it as people try to get to the "so-called" event.  If this were truly
a role-playing experience GMs would circulate constantly through the game
creating small and private role-playing events for limited numbers of
players.  This did, in fact, go on at one time but to my knowledge has not
occurred in at least a year.
