}Apparently you missed the word "usually" in my sentence.

Yeah, I'll agree with the 'usually'.  But the exceptions do tend to be 
rather glaring. :)

}That's one thing...apparently you're insinuating that they don't admit to
}way too many things...what else didn't they admit to in 2.25 years?  I'd be
}shocked if you could come up with a half dozen.  I can't even think of 3.

The only other one I can think of right off is those broken monk epic 
mobs.  They denied those were broken for quite a while...

Yeah, a half dozen would be hard.  But I wouldn't be suprised if there's 
more than just these two.  Still, 'usually', and all that.
