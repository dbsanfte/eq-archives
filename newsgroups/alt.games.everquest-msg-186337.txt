That's right, I "argue for the sake of arguing" in spite of merely having
corrected your *wrong* assertion that not only didn't help the guy asking
the question but in fact could harm him.  You then decided to argue in the
face of irrefutable evidence.

To put it another way, there *isn't* anything to argue here.  You stated
something that was wrong, you were corrected.  That, my poor illiterate, is
the end of that.
