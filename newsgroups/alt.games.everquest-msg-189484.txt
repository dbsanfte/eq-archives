Hmm, OK but that still doesnt deal with the zone line safety issue (OK if
you are 60 odd its not an issue but a lot of people in and around the the
GD zone will have an issue with this) - as you say there are a few items
specific to Thurg and its not really that much further to Thurg from mosy
directions given the running round in PoK you have to do to get the
supplies....add to that there are two possible supplements that were under
dicsussino (Luclin and PoP) I still think there is a good role for the GD
based city.....
