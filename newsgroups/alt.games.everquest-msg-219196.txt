Add in magician here.  Given the (poor) quality of pre-kunark gear,
and the incredible ability of a 49 fire pet to solo blue cons with
ease, mages were definitely overpowered at this point.

Here's an odd one for mages - the great mod rod fiasco.  Mages were wanted,
but only for their ability to generate limitless amounts of mana through
rods.  Many mages quit during Luclin, as they saw their role on raids being
limited to "rod-whore."

In addition, where 'chanters and necros got dire-charm, and wizards got
mana burn, the offensive aa given to magicians resulted in a total damage
increase of 700 damage every 72 minutes.

Early in the expansion, mages still had no respect.  However, the
perception among the player base has changed, and more and more people
understand the DPS we bring to a group.  On leaving PU groups I've
often been asked to find a "rogue or mage" for my replacement.

Only very well equipped melee's can consistently match the DPS of a
mage with average gear.

Simply untrue.  The epic pet was overpowered for its era.  It was a
terrible mistake: It removed one of the things that seperated good mages
from bad - the ability to use the right pet in the right circumstance.  
With the epic pet the decision was made for you.  

The advent of 61 air and 62 water returned this decision to the mage -
on mobs <level 60 epic pets do nearly as much damage as a properly
positioned 62 water pet, without positioning issues.  For tanking low
to mid 50's mobs the epic pet does WAY more DPS than a 61 air, has
more HP, has an innate DS that is bigger than Flameshield of Ro and 
grabs aggro far better.

Mages need to move on - the epic pet (a misnomer btw, these were particle
effect weapons that resulted from an epic quest - the devs never meant
them to be the be-all, end-all weapons for a class) is several expansions
old.

Add mages in here again - DPS is key, and we provide it in spades.
