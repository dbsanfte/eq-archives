Sort of. I took advantage of the Lords of EverQuest offer last year when it
was offered and so have a guaranteed spot in that cycle, whenever it starts.
The way I understand the beta cycles, they will go something like this:

1) Closed beta (underway now)
2) Legends subscribers rolled in
3) LoE players rolled in
4) Open beta
5) Release

So whenever they get around to 3) I'll be playing. I also applied for the
closed beta independently but haven't heard anything there, yet, but I
believe those decisions haven't been made yet so I could get in there too.
Meanwhile, I have a pre-order kit which allows me to create the character
that I'll be playing when the game starts, and most of my friends joining me
from other games will remember me as Winter, so I decided to pull him out of
retirement. I'm looking forward to trying this one out.

Are you in one of the beta cycles?
