If the pick up group can't adapt to a non-KEI caster then I identify the 
members who are problematic and don't group with them again. Its really 
quite simple.

I don't need KEI to do this.

It helps that I'm not hung up about about my 'success' record, and that 
I'm not afraid of dying, rezzes are easy to get after ldon.
