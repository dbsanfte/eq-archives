I see you picked the crack pipe up again...    an enchanter, magician, and
monk don't even compare 50% to the ability of a druid solo.

I've seen a druid root dot SEVEN mobs in the grey in 1 pull, that druid was
solo.  As a 60 monk, I'll be damned if I could even solo 1 of those mobs let
alone 2.

The druid in question isn't really a power gamer, she never raids, all her
gear comes from zones she hunts in, she has level 1 of the AA title.  I'm on
my final AA title (50 or so aa levels), I have nToV loot/Sleepers weapons
(primal)... so please explain your "monks will easily double the kill rate
of a druid"

I know as a magician, if I get an add its bad news.. Im either gating or
dieing in most cases.  As a magician I don't even compare 1 bit to soloing
as good as a druid (w/my 54 magician).   Mages are good at clearing lowbie
dungeons/zones if your gonna camp something

Enchanters.. lol.  Maybe I just suck as a game player.. having played a
chanter upto 54, I'd have to say thats the most laughable of your comments

SK.. ya SK's can solo, albeit slowly.  The only real effective soloing
method for an SK is fear kiting, and as a 54 troll SK, with a INT level of
120, believe me theres a lot of downtime.

Whats this etc etc bullshit?  Theres one class who can solo better then a
druid, and thats a necro.  Subsequently, necros are probably the least
desired in an exp group AND in a raid.

Stop fucking whining about druids.

If you believe the class is broken, make a new fucking character !
