Suicidal? Hardly takes that... a number of people have been 'obsessed' 
with EQ to some degree; deleting the character simply removes the 
temptation to come back and get sucked in. You don't need to have 
'serious problems' in order to decide that EQ is too much a time sink on 
your life, so much so that you want to make a clean break of it.

Another reason for deletion is as a silent protest to SoE. It sends the 
message that they've gone too far, and they've now lost a customer... 
vs... I'm just taking some time off and may come back later.
