Being a wood elf from Greater Faydark (what, no water?) it took a while
before I could get my swimming skill nice and high. Places i've enjoyed
swimming;

Halas: How cool is this, a huge basin in the town. No self respecting
barbarian will catch the raft so there's lots of other people swimming
as well. No monsters in the water and swimming while it snows on you
is cool. Can be a bit dark and deep though. And afterwards the pub and
a hot fire are close at hand.

Oasis of Marr: Swimming with crocs in it. They don't agro and gliding
through the water with them is fun. Also good because it's a straight
coast with a gently sloping beach so there's no danger of getting lost.
There's also a raft to dive off and pillars to swim to. South Ro has
the same beaches, but no crocs to swim with.

Surefall Glade: Under the rangers guild there's a nice shallow pool to
swim in, with the scenic surroundings adding to the fun. Lots to dive
under and swim around and no danger of getting lost or too deep.
