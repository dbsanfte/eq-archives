Clinging Darkness DID NOT make you blind. If I was going to take a guess,
I'd say a blind spell did. Clinging Darkness is like the snare series. it
slows the target. low levels dont slow it much but the 34+ ones oh good lord
they are nice. plus they do a small amount of damage over time.
    they are best used with fear and your pet. you slow them down then pet
has easier time bashing and smashing them when they are feared
