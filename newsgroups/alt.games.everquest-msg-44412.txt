Forget the name now, but it's sold in the same shop as the jewelery kit
(why they sell jewel craft kits in a city where none of the inhabitants
can enchant the metal seems odd to me, but then they made everyone take
up jewelcraft that wanted to do  the shawl quests too, so they obviously
don't see it as the problem the players do).  It's near the "teleporter"
that takes you to the cleric guild.
