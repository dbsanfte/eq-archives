I explain it this: Not all druid rings are the same.

For example, at the WC rings there are two druids (who I believe are druid
trainers) and a vendor. None of them care what you do to animals in their
sight, whether bears or cats (no wolves in WC iirc).

But at the NK druid rings, there are a number of 'a druid', Tak Whistler (a
vendor), and Briana Treewhisper (a trainer), plus a number of treants, ALL
of whom will care VERY MUCH if you are fighting - or even just being hit
by - an animal.

Similarly, Toxx druid rings = safe, BBM = safe, WK EK = unsafe.. Lavastorm =
no animals, SRo = safe... if there are others I forget them at the moment.
