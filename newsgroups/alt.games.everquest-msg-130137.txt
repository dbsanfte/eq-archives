Don't forget long lasting cheap snare, and Harmony, and better roots.

As a Wizard, my snare only lasts about 2 and a half minutes.  Druids snare
for around 11 minutes.  Mine is 125 mana but AOE.  Theirs is 35 mana, single
target.  For snaring single targets, theirs is way better.  For quading,
mine is slightly better in terms of mana *if* I get no resists, and can get
all the mobs together before snaring.  So, to multikite, I've got to run
around with my jboots, pissing off my mobs with my Staff of Temperate Flux,
then run the unsnared mobs around to get them into a tight group, then cast
my AOE snare.  If I get a resist, I've either got to root that one and hope
I can get the others out of its chase range before root breaks, or spend 125
more mana snaring that one, then I've got to get them all together again,
and snare again, because time is running out on the first snare.  If I get
some resists on the nukes, I may not have enough mana to finish things,
after spending all that mana on snares.

There are places as a Wizard that I can kite that Druids can't, because of
my fast nukes.  (650 damage for 215 mana, 3 second cast).  However, there
are many more places Druids can kite that I can't, because they can single
pull mobs with Harmony.

Finally, if there is a need to med during a fight, mobs get fewer checks to
break Druid roots than Wizard roots, so Druids can root park and med better
than Wizards.

Wizard crits are nice...but what they basically mean is that some fights use
a little less mana than they would otherwise, so we get slightly less
downtime.  They don't really enable us to do anything we couldn't otherwise
do.  They are nothing like cheap long snares or Harmony or better roots.

Basically, drop a Druid and a Wizard in some random outdoor area, and the
Druid is going to have a better time soloing.  Wizards are great outdoor
soloers, but we have to pick our fights much more carefully, and we don't
have the option to switch from nuke kiting to root/rot or use a charmed pet
or (at lower levels) melee and damage shield.
