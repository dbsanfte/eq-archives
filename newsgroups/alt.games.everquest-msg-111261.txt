Yeah, that's what I thought, but the mage and cleric know that I can CC, 
grouped with them in everything from duo to 40+ person raid.  The others 
were people I had grouped with before, though I hadn't seen the shammy in 
about 6 months.  I didn't think they were hitting that hard, seemed to be 
doing less damage than Kobalds in Velks, but I've upgraded AC 
significantly since last time I was seriously hunting Velks.

Well, the exact mechanics are target a mob, sing level 53 mez song, and 
immediately target the next mob, restart the song as soon as it takes 
effect.  Most of the bard songs last 12 seconds, plus time remaining on 
current tick.  I can keep 4 locked down solid, though it takes me a couple 
rounds to do so.  Positioning the mobs so that you can select the next one 
easily is the tricky part.  I generally start with mobs all over and end 
up with them lined up neatly.  If there is a shaman in the group they can 
slow the mobs too, which makes it significantly easier.  If there isn't a 
shaman, I use an AE slow/snare song.  Gets aggro on me, slows the attack, 
and keeps them from running after the cleric too quickly.

I guess that's true.  I just don't think my guild is nearly as uber as I 
used to think.  I guess it's all relative.

Hmmm, maybe because there are enough bandits that you never have to worry 
about running out of mobs, compared to shrooms which are great at 
off-hours, but very camped during primetime.

I honestly have no idea what loot drops in CT, other than I hear there are 
some nice bard boots there.  I don't think they're better than Kael quest 
armor, but they may be.  I just love that zone.  I loved it when I was in 
my 20s and 30s, and I love it more now.  One of the best nights I've had 
in EQ recently involved a group of guildmates and recruits in the throne 
room.  The cleric went LD on the first pull and never came back, but we 
were able to keep the entire room cleared for several hours.  Another 
guild had a couple groups there, and we could hear them training out and 
dying.  We just sat happily in the TR getting drunk and killing lizards.
I *really* like the fact that a bard is arguably better at CC than an 
enchanter there (OOS and mez is faster and safer than Tash and mez).
