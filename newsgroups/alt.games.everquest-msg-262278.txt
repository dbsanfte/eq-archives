I thoroughly enjoyed reading your post!

I miss the old EQ. It seems like only yesterday when I was in Kelethin and I 
didn't even know how to open my back pack that a friend had given to me. I 
remember once running from one of those Baslik lizard guys in Kelethin and 
almost being dead, running for the guards for protection, seeing the ramp 
down, so I jump on and head up, only to have the Baslik join me for the ride 
up and proceed to finish me off! Thanks guards! lol

I can't wait for EQII only because, I'm hoping that I will have that 
"newbie" feeling all over again! You know what I  mean? Like when you were 
about to die, and you started to panic, because you thought you would never 
find your corpse!!
Or the first time you took on a "named" mob? I remember the first time I was 
in Crushbone and D'Vinn came running down! Players where running around in 
chaos! Players screaming in chat "Run! He backstabs for over 100!!" and then 
as your trying to fight, you see most of your group running and jumping out 
the windows of the Castle to save themselves!!

Ahh those were the days!!
