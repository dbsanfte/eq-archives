I'd be all for that.  I was speaking from the standpoint that I don't know
exactly how he got it though. This child could have been the victim of
sexual abuse and gotten AIDS that way. He could have been given IV drugs by
someone and gotten AIDS that way.  Without knowing it isn't right to state
why.

I was also making this statement in an attempt to avoid bigotry.  The child
is a victim of a disease and should be treated as such. How he got it really
doesn't matter to how he should be treated. My apologies if you took this as
bigotry  as this was not what I intended.
