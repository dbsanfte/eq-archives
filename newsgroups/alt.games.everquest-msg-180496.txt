So what you are saying is that Black people are corrupted by evil even
then
only white, elite of those get to live with their creator/ruler.
You racist bigot

Sorry Ryou I don't see any Sarcasm here at all. Freeman writes ' So
what you are saying..' which implies that he thinks D'lo is making a
statement. Then he even goes as far a calling D'lo a "racist Bigot"
which IMHO I don't believe either one of those guys is ( D'lo , DT).
I think Freeman just jumped the gun without reading the whole thread.
