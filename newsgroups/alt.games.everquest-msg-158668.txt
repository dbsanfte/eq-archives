Don't believe this.  5 of us (52war, 53chanter, 47monk, 49rog, 54dru) burnt
a path from zone in to the efreeti in SolB and then farmed his boots for
about 3 hours.  Our druid was the only healer and a damn good one at that!

Not only did we also get some nice Skin buffs, but DS for the 3 tanks as
well!  Then when finished, we succored to zone, and then ported the rest
out.

I absolutely love druids (not just as porters mind you) and have, and always
will welcome them in my groups.

I don't pair up much, but maybe more of a tanker type maybe a Ranger,
Paladin, Warrior or Monk?

Face it, this is a silly game.
