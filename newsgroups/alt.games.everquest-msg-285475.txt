For 98% of the WOW community these changes wont have any bearing, just the 
healers in raiding guilds.
In a way you're lucky cos you will never have known thew simplicity and ease 
with which we could track the people who are damaged in raids and heal them. 
Now we will have to stare at 40 health bars and play whack a mole.

Gonna be very mentally tiring and bad for the eyes.

Blizzard will probably throw us a bone when half the healers quit and none 
of the guilds are able to raid anymore, but its anyones guess how long that 
cycle will take.
