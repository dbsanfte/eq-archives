He'd probably be better equipped than my current warrior, as the stuff he 
can buy in the bazaar with what he earns is significantly superior to 
what I bought him when I did.  In fact, I soloed him up to level 29 with 
no haste item at all, dressed in a mix of banded/bronze/crafted armor.  
It's trivial to solo a warrior if you find the right places, at least up 
to the low 30s which is what I have experience with so far.
