Actually, I believe this is incorrect.  Not certain, but I believe you
generally don't see a higher hit rate from high attack.


What it does do is influence the amount of damage you do on a successful
hit.  On each successful hit, your attack skill is compared to the mobs
armor class.  The result of this is that higher attack scores will tend to
hit for closer to maximum damage, while low attack scores will tend to hit
towards the bottom end of your possible damage.
