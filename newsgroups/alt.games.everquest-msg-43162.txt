Coldain Velium weapons proc at level 1.  Most people would consider that
low level.   Furthermore, they're vendor-sold for around 100pp, depending
on faction and charisma, of course.   Basically, they're FS weapons with a
12 DD proc at level 1.   That's a good choice for baby twinks until they
outgrow the weapon.
