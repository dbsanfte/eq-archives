Too many changes in too short a time.
Don't expect to play much tonight.

Lot of good changes mind you, just know that somewhere there is going to be
a problem, something will clash.
Removing the Tome of Discord from newbie equipment should have been done
LONG ago.
Also, it has saved me from a trip into split paw to get Summon Corpse for my
Necro, they are definitely on a mission to make corpse retrievals easier but
I said this when DAoC came out, that was part of the intensity of the game,
exp loss never bothered me, losing my equipment did I guess I shan't have
the worry quite so much, will that make the game a lesser or greater
experience tho, who can tell.

Competition,
Who gets the first tell from a newly dinged level 10 saying "Can you spare
any items? I died and lost everything I had" Need a screen shot ;ï¿½)

/Ignore works on /random spam...At LAST!

Paladins with res spells, although likely much lesser than Clerics, should
make the Paladins more appealing to groups.

Even although I have to agree in a way they have dumbed down the lower level
game I'm not so sure it's a bad thing as yet, as long as it stays in the low
levels I don't mind.
