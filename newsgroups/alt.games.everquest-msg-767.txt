As others have said it is a good way to spend time when waiting for boats.
You can also fish on boats. It's a bit tricky as if you are too close to the
edge it give you a "You must be on dry land" message and if you are too far back
it give you the "land shark" message. Also EQ seems to randomly decide what is
the right point as you can cast OK one time then fail either way the next time.

Ho hum, still it save me buying food.
