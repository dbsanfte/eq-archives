Whenever I've played Nuetral in D&D, neutral is designed as a balancing
force. If evil is winnig it sides with good... good winning it sides with
evil. Right now evil is winning so Neutral should side with good (And have
the option to do so via ability to help one side and harm the other) if the
neutral faction is dead set on wageing a two front war DESPITE the obvious
imbalance they are 1) Stupid and 2) not playing their role which re inforces
the stupid part. What use is a neutral that doesn't promote balance? might
as well get rid of it and have pure 'good' 'evil' options only.
