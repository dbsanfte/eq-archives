I bought PoP, installed it, registered it etc. A few days later my computer
crashed and I have to do a total reinstall. Well, I can't find my PoP disc.
Granted, an avid EQer should know better than to lose his most cherished
posession, the CDs, but alas I am a messy person lol. Is there anyway I can
get the files need for PoP? Like if I got the eqgame.exe file from someone,
when I patch, would it download the PoP files I don't have since it thinks
it should have it? My guildmates have it, but no one around me has PoP so I
can't borrow any CDs. Just trying to find some options, since buying another
copy isn't one.
