well... after a lot of discussion between the two main guilds, it looked 
like the SLeeper would be safely sleeping on Fennin for a long time to 
come.

Last night, after OOR killed Hraashna, Tukurak, and Ventaani, they left.

Most of them did anyway.

A small number of them snuck behind their own guild's back and killed
Nanzata, waking the Sleeper. 

So Fennin joins the rest of the servers with a gimped zone.  /sigh
