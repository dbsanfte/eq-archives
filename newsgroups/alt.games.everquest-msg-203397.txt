My level 54 ranger plays with my BFs 54 wizard.  We started these characters in
2000, long before KEI existed.
I think KEI on a ranger is like sprinkles on ice cream.  I can keep us sowed
and buffed.  I also keep the mobs debuffed and snared.  And I keep us both
healed, (mainly me - he doesn't get hit often).  With KEI I also kept the mobs
dotted ... 
I will probably continue to pay for KEI for my ranger, and I'm sure he will
continue to pay for KEI for his wizard.
Just my two cents.
O, for our baby characters, they'll learn to adjust.
