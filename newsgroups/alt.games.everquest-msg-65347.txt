Hello,
      This doesn't affect me personally, but looking at the Sony site
Today there was the clear statement that Windows 95 is not supported.
This is beacuse 85 can't support DX 8.1, which is required for Luclin.

Being a good consumer I checked the box and it also lists 98 as a
minimum requirement. My guild had two people trying Windows 95 second
addition, but eventually had to upgrade.

Everyone probably know this, but just in case. 

Ken
