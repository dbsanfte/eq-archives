Eh, it might, but I could never spare the spell slot for stuns, except in 
aoeing situations.  Besdes, you only have to channel the first mezz... if 
it's an aoe mez.  A lot of encs are told bad things about aoe mezz, but 
I've frequently found it invaluable.

Color stuns have this annoying tendency, IMO.  By the time your spell gems 
refresh, the stun is halfway through its duration... then you start to 
cast your mezz, and one second into the cast, the stun wears off and all 4 
mobs hit you at once.  Thre's no way you can channel that.  I always 
seemed much better off if (a) the mob's delay timers were not synched up, 
and (b) I hadn't built a huge amount of aggro on the mobs by stunning 
them, so one or two would actually go pound on a wizard for a second or 
something.  But hey, lots of encs use color stuns to great effect.  And in 
aoe groups, they absolutely rule, no question.  I just personally haven't 
been as thrilled with them as their reputation.

I do wish raid leaders would get it through their head, though, that encs 
and wizards need at least 12 seconds warning before they decide we should 
aoe on this pull. :)  One stun, I may have memmed, just by accident, but 
please, give me a sec to get the other three up there and equip my color 
flux wand. :)
