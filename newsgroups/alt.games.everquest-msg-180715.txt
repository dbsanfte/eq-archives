	Nope, not since they made pet only spells (buffs, heals, etc)
	auto-target your pet.  Attempting to target another pet when you
	don't have a pet up results in you de-targeting and getting the "you
	must target a player to cast this spell" or such message.

	Damn shame really.  With so many pet classes the ability to cast pet
	spells on other pets would make Beastlords much more desirable in
	groups.  Mages can hand the other pets armor (see below) that never
	wares off unless pet dies.  The least they could do is put a check
	in that it auto-targets your pet only if you don't have another pet
	targeted.

	Pets are people too...  On yah, and group spells not affecting pets
	is beyond lame. :-P

: Beastlords have very nice pet only heals too.  Pets are usually lower
: level and take a lot of damage quickly.

	Really depends on the pet.  Mages in particular have quite a few
	options between dealing damage, taking damage, avoiding damage, or a
	mix.

	FYI, your pet can also ware armor and take advantage of focus items. 
	If you're a mage, or a pet class with a mage around, summon up some
	plate armor, rings of levitate (4 or 5ac each), etc.  If your pet
	casts nukes (fire pet) swap one of the summoned bracers from the
	armor kit for the summoned focus bracelet.  BTW...do NOT give the
	armor to the pet in the bag; you must give it in pieces (4 at a time
	is fine) for the pet to use it.

	My 47 mage can drop 150 or so of AC gear on any pet.  Dropping that
	gear on low level non-mage pets like necro and such turns them into
	pretty beefy tanks.

	The down side is a full set of pet gear will suck down nearly 1/2 my
	mana (200 int) and between pointlessly long cast times, recast
	times, and swapping spells out, the entire ordeal takes like 10-15
	minutes.  Add mana regen, focus items for myself, and buffs and
	we're talking a good 30 minutes logged into EQ before I'm able to
	actually do anything...  God forbid I have to zone or I otherwise
	lose the pet...poof another 20-30 minutes of down time.

	Summoned pet gear is one of the best and worst aspects of being a
	mage...

: If you expect your pet to keep up with you, then yes, it needs SoW too.

	Mages get a pet-only sow.  Not as good as SoW and also has the
	outdoor restriction.  Only really useful if you don't have a sower
	around and you're thus downing SoW potions.
