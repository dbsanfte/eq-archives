Prepare before porting.  SoW everyone (if you are a wizard,
see if you can't get sows for everyone from someone in the
area group or the area you are porting from.  Frankly, at 10pp
a hit, 10 pack SoW potions should be in everyone's inventory
if they are making a trip to SOV anyway.)

Invis everyone but yourself.  Instruct all members of the port to
immediately make a dash for the beach and prepare for incoming.
Invis yourself the second you arrive, and do the same.  You -may-
still have a fight on your hands, if someone's invis drops or you
yourself popped in aggro range.  Don't fight at or near the
ring, too many wanderers.  In gangs, those critters can tear
down a 49 paladin... I know, cause I've ressed one.

If you aren't porting a group, but rather doing taxi duty, they should
rather be instructed to run for the bridge.  Nothing in the
zone runs faster than SoW, and almost nothing casts (settting
aside the odd turtle, which will summon you anyway) so just barreling
to zone is reasonably safe.
