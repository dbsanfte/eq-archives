Let me offer some of mine, I am a Kubrik fan so those long wide shots
interest me.

Looking at The outpost in Overthere from the top of the wall near the
PoK book. The ships behind the outpost, and the fire was always a nice
view.

I like seeing the ToFS from out a ways. Inside ToFS 6th floor is kinda
cool.

The Dragon Bridge from the IC zone is neat too.

I liked Maiden's Eye, the mobs scurrying around and the little thinks
like the Heiroglyphics by Akheva are neat.

I also like looking at the sky in the PoT while I fish waiting for
someone to get me. I know there are better places to fish, but I like
the psychadelic light show.
