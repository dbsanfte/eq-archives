I havent really bothered with Brawlers and Battlemasters (except for my 
first night, when I was learning the area)...most of the time I group on 
the west side of the lake near the pillars and fight Goblin Warlords, 
Iksars, Skeletons and Sarnaks...they're usually red to me, but I've been 
grouping with a great druid and cleric alot lately, and weve been raking 
in the money and exp.
