    Sorry but how is that even remotely cool? Looks like a combination of
soul crushing tedium and gameplay-destroying spoilery - especially if the
maps are saleable once you've made them. (reduces A but increases B)

was having to learn to navigate by landmarks, and learning to take not of
these landmarks as you learn a new area.
