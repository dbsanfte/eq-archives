Until someone who actually knows responds, I'll take a crack at this one.

Put your stat food / drink in your main inv slot, you immediately get the 
bonuses.  Keep food / drink in another main slot and eat / drink off and on 
to make sure your character doesn't auto-eat / drink your stat food / 
drink.  I don't know how long each of the various foods / drinks last, but 
I make fish rolls and they last a loooong time and they aren't even the 
best.

I read that Vah Shir consume food ( and maybe drink ) faster than the other 
races.  Not sure if it is rumor, but some zones like Oasis will make you 
drink faster, I hear.
