I can make banded myself (and yes, trade skills are still retarded !!)
Im sorry my expectations of you were higher !

Omg consider yourself lucky !!
xxx tells you, "can you kill a SG and let me loot it?"
xxy tells you, "can i have his loot?"  (before it was even dead)
xxx,xxy and xxz all tells you, "can i loot it?? can i loot it??"  (the
second he dies)

Maybe im not a man then :/
Mobs like Seru and Emp tho.. you can figure you will only be getting 1 loot
from them.. do you really want a horsey, or something with 10billion AC,
1000HP and a right click 10k nuke?

There are extensions for buff durations, but focus effects do the same thing
so they are kinda a waste of AA points.
If you want an uber, long lasting shaman buff, offer a shaman in the nexus
some plat to cast khuras on you/your group (your too low for single version,
so may as well get a group to benefit).. its about the longest lasting and
best shaman buff.
