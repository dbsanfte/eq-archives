Im also a 12 necromancer and have experienced similar things though i dont
think id dare take my pet to black burrow heh. I  use the /follow command
mostly and if im running quite far, like buying from the merchants in EC tunnel
ill have him /guard here at the front because ive noticed that on long runs
pets can just dissapear. I've also noticed that a couple of times ill be stood
around and suddenly my pet will dart off as if to attack something, run off
into the sunset only to re-appear at my side a couple of seconds later.
