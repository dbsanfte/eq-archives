Actually, SK is now a radically different zone, at least around the middle;
they apparantly revamped splitpaw again, and dumped all the contents of 
the place out into SK, so instead of a couple static gnolls per spire 
and not much at all by way of wanderers, now there are dozens of gnolls 
of wildly varying class and level, and you're in an outdoor zone so 
tactical possibilities are different than they were back when you did 
paw mobs indoors.

Might still not be different enough for you, but its not the same as it 
was before.
