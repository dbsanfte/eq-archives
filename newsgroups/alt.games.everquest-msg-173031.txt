AFAIK there are 2 versions of the "new dawn" package the one contains just
the basic everquest game and Planes of Power (this is meant for upgrade and
i spose they include the basic game in case you get this one by
mistake?????) and the other contains the whole lot. your best bet is to go
to your friendly software dealer and you may get lucky and find someone who
actually knows what they are talking about (LOL) but even then read the cd
case carefully and the important bit is on the front top right where it
lists the packages included.
Good hunting
