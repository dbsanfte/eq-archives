Depends on the level of the zone. low level zones (10-20) won't be affected
much in old world/kunark, the people at that range won't take the trip to
luclin. Luclin newbie zones will be PACKED TO THE RAFTERS with people
starting cats. It will fall off drastically after about a week or so, but
until then, expect 150+ level 5 and below cats to be in the newbie zone
24/7.

Some of the current zones will become ghost towns...xp zones, mostly. Zones
where items drop will have people taking advantage of the folks rushing to
Luclin to do some farming (ie: frenzy in Lguk). Places like Velk, KC,
Sebilis will dry up pretty heavy, as the higher level people go check out
the new zones. After about a month, the populations in the older zones will
raise up a bit...how high depends on the quality of the Luclin high level
zones. If the moon is full of velks-as-it-was-when-velious-came-out zones,
then nobody will go there until verant wakes up and changes it.

The smartest thing to do, regardless of level, is to rush your ass to
Luclin the very MINUTE the servers come up, and start running through zones
and killing everything you see. I can 100% guarantee you that verant will
do some sort of massive fuck-up of the drop tables. There is some debate
over whether they do this deliberately or not, but when a new zone opens,
the drop rates at 5x what they will be 2 weeks after the zone is up, and
sometimes you will find items that will be outright removed from the spawns
(see: the amazingly good gem encrusted rings from DL giants that don't drop
anymore anywhere) . Get in while the getting is good, cause once they put
in the first patch, the drops will turn into shit. This is especially true
if they implement a new plane in Luclin (say, Decay)....planar drops when
they first open are like fine steel in Cazic-Thule. Take advantage of it.
