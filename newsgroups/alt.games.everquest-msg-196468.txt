 What exactly is the twisting of bard songs? I always loved to watch
bards...back in the days when that loading song meant the sound of excitment
and adventure...watching the bards do performances for their guild hanging
out by the bank in Kelethin...but anyway what is twisting exactly? I know it
has to do with the combination of songs...but thats about all I know about
bards...so if anyone knows anything, I'd apprectiate the spread of
knowledge. Thanks in advance
