I just found this file and wondered if the error messages
in it contain any clues to my problem. It's a long file
so I'll just include the lines that have errors.

I've been unable to connect to any EQ server since
reactivating my account about a month ago. I emailed
tech support and they put the blame on my ISP this made sense
because they had just started upgrading(?)the cable modems to
DOCSIS ones(don't have one here yet)and in general my net
connection has been bad since the change over started...
Anyway this has been going on for a long time now and I figure
even with a flakey connection I should actually be able to get
on a server at least once for a few minutes but all that happens
is select a charand see the "you have been disconnected" screen.
