    I have this problem, I get dropped to the desk top for no reason at all.
I have had it happen in other zones but it seems to happen more reqularly in
the bazaar.

       I am running EQ on two different computers and I do not think it is
ISp issue. I have noticed that it seems to happen more regularly since LOY
was released. Actaully I do not remember it happening all that often before
lOY now it is a very regular occurance.

    In short SOE has done something.
