I don't think this is a bug.  It actually appears to tailor nicely with what
rogue have been asking for with Evade...an escape mechanism.

Was fighting in the Dreadlands early morning US when our ranger
pulled 3 giants by accident and she told me to run to Karnors.

I evaded, started running, then stopped and snuck/hide past the two
drolvargs at the KC entrance.  With the way evade used to work
I never would have "hidden," and probably be lunchmeat.  It's
not a "get out of death free" like Feign Death is at lower levels, because
it does NOT wipe aggro.  What it does is allow you to get out of a bad
situation as long as the critter you were fighting  and his buddies are
still
whaling on the tank/DA'd cleric without aggroing the rest of the
zone on your way out.

It could be a bug, but this is exactly what many rogues have been asking
for.

The "fighting while hidden"  isn't exactly correct, either.  As long as
you are still around, the critter knows it, and any wandering friends
know it, too.  You just don't "carry the hate" with you anymore, which
made it impossible to hide from anything when on one Mob's hate
list.
