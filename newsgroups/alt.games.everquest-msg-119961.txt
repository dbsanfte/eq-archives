I don't want to talk about shissar right now, had a rather bitter experience
over it this weekend.

But I finally (FINALLY!) got my essence last week.  We'd been raiding Hate
fairly regularly for the last couple of months (with occaisional raids in
the months prior) just to get epic drops for people, and it finally dropped. 
It also dropped last week, but I had missed the first part of that raid
because my wife wanted to go look at patio furniture, so it went to someone
else.  In all the months we've been hitting Hate, those are the only two
times the essence has dropped.

All them Hate raids have been good to me, though.  Got a damn near complete
set of Insidious.  And the last time we killed Innoruuk, he dropped an
"Engineer's Ring".  Gnome only.  Being the only Gnome on the raid, I got it. 
It is my preciousssssssss, yesssss, it isssss....

Verina Tomb was easy.  Just camp a DE mule on her spawn spot and check it
every day.  Eventually, she'll be up.  Same with the guy in the Cabilis
sewers.  The Tangrin seems to be up more often than not.

In my mind, the hardest parts are (in no particular order)
1. Essence of a Vampire
2. Shissar Head
3. Prince in Chardok
3. That ruby from CoM
