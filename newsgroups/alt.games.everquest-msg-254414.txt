I thought about this and figured it would come up.  I, too, think everyone
should get a chance, but not at the expense of the entire group.  You said the
guy wasn't really doing much damage either, so I figured he must be working on
a new weapon skill.  Now add that to being a mana drain and, well, not optimal
in my mind.  
I've often wanted to ask the MT if he is taunting or *just what weapon is that
you are using and is it new?*, but that seems really rude so I never have.
My ranger *hates* getting agro herself and isn't twinked.  I always have jolt
on myself and a damage shield on the MT and never snare until the mob is near
death.  I *shouldn't* be able to get agro grouped with an *uber armored /
weaponed* warrior.   (And I'm pretty darn sad when I do.).

Snare axes right?  I have a zerker friend...There again, a ranger or druid who
is *so* new to grouping and their class that they don't know they should be
snaring isn't going to learn if someone doesn't tell them to, and the sooner
the better.
