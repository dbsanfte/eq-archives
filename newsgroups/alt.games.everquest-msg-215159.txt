200 malachite is my minimum when I'm close to a vendor, In addition
My guildmates make sure I have 100-120 pearls on hand at all times
so I don't have to get cash from an officer and visit the vendor
before a raid.  As a result I usually have 2 10slots reserved for
reagents.  Of my other 2 10slots, 1 is over half full of swap gear.
The other 4 general slots usually (for outdoor/pop xp groups) have
1xsummoned 10slot bag, Torch of Alna, Mod Rod, Drogmor Drum (ammo
slot is a coldstone.)

200 malachite isn't as much as it seems if you pet canni as much
as I do.  I'm a couple aa from /pet hold then 5 more to elemental
pact so I only have to carry 1 malachite around.
