Except...in this case, Sony has a section on their web page that gives 
folks permission to use EverQuest names/places/etc. in fan fiction and 
fan art. 

*clears throat before she reads off the scroll*

"SOE hereby grants to each EverQuest account subscriber that is in good 
standing and with the grant automatically revoked as of the moment that 
the subscriber's account is no longer in good standing (an "EQ 
Subscriber"), a limited, personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, 
nonassignable and fully revocable license to use (a) the EverQuest name, 
and (b) trademarks and copyrighted material from EverQuest including NPC 
names and images, diety and monster names and images, geographical 
names, item names and images, character names and images, background 
art, and screenshots containing any of the foregoing (collectively, "the 
SOE Property"), solely to be used for material (for example, so-called 
"fan fiction" and "fan artwork") that the EQ Subscriber posts to and/or 
transmits through SOE's Communication Features ("Licensed Content") in 
accordance with these Terms of Service -- and for no other use."

I found this out just an hour ago, so, well...even if my other argument 
about EQ being the medium, not the creative work, held true...Amulett is 
working within guidelines approved by Sony.

Oh, and someone else mentioned Parody. Well, as it turns out, that guild 
wasn't actually working within the legal guidelines of what defines 
parody.  Just slapping words and a moustache on a piece of art doesn't 
qualify as parody.
