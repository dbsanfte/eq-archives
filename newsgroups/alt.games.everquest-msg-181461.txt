It wasn't a MQ.  He was max ally.

The monk who tried to MQ with a cleric was max ally (and successfully
quested his own leather sleeves)

My girlf successfully quested her SS plate legs (cleric)

I assume the warrior and cleric dudes are bugged on certain items.. I don't
know if any others are though.

I have an assload of armour to MQ, but I don't want to while its in a bugged
state... having a gm refuse to help because it was a MQ, and losing chain
bp/legs would make me cry irl :(
