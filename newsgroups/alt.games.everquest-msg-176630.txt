Ah, but you could....so long as you have the relevant starting details of
the account you can always reacticate the account - more importantly for
resale even if you handed over the account, which can be done, you could
simply go to Sony and get the account back from someone else a year down
the line....

You would be fine....as it is you can sell the software - for someone who
has say lost their disks but needs to re -install, but that key is useless
to them so they cant use the CD you gave them to start to play - I dont
know if SONY sell standalone keys which would be sensible to my mind...

Ties to the account, the account can be reactivated, theoretically billing
details can be changed to allow someone else to be using it...but Sony
consider the account yours and non transferable 

Software could be sold on, but its not going to be playable....
