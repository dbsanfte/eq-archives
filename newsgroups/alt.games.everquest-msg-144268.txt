It's a fair question.

I'm suggesting that it's absurd that the school officials in question
believe that a teacher became ill *because* a hex was cast. This
demonstrates not only a complete lack of understanding of what Wicca
is, but also a startlingly poor grasp of how the physical world works,
and a near-pathological gullibility.

Bear in mind that there are as many varieties of Wicca as there are of
Christianity, and my answers reflect my personal views.

Wicca is first and foremost a religion, and legally recognized as
such. It is not 'witchcraft' in the traditional horror-movie sense of
an old hag casting spells to give her neighbors boils or make their
cattle lame, which is what these school officials seem to think.

These officials aren't alone in that, of course. It is extremely easy
to have entirely the wrong impression as to what Wicca and magick are.
A couple hours a week of prime time TV will give you all kinds of
misinformation (despite which, I still really enjoy Buffy). Add to
that the rantings of fundamentalists and the relative secrecy that
Wiccans have kept about themselves until fairly recently, and it's
little wonder that the religion is misunderstood.

As for what's the point of being Wiccan, I'll readily grant that for
some people, especially teenagers, the point is very much that they're
attracted by shows like Buffy and Charmed, and think it would be cool
to "play witch". I've been alternately amused and disturbed by the
dramatic increase in shelf space that book stores are giving to the
subject these days - certainly are large percentage of them are
nothing more than jumping on the bandwagon. It's gotten to the point
that I won't buy a Wicca book unless the copyright date is more than
ten years old or it's been highly recommended by the community.

Back to the 'point' question, though. The point of being Wiccan is to
express your love and worship for deity and earth, to improve
yourself, and to make the world a better place. Not much different
than many other religions in concept, even if it is quite different in
the methods and practices it uses.

>It seems like they're saying one thing in public, and another 
>in private.  Maybe there's something I'm just not understanding.

Magick in Wicca is analogous to prayer in Christianity. When a
Catholic priest converts wafers into the body of Christ, from a Wiccan
perspective he's performing magick. When a parishioner prays for a
friend to recover from illness, from a Wiccan perspective she's
performing magick. Any action that invokes deity, from simply making
the sign of the cross to a hugely intricate Christmas mass, is magick
to the Wiccan. (Please forgive the Catholic-centric examples - I was
raised Catholic and don't know enough about other religions to draw
good examples).

Wiccans may use ceremonies, incantations and tools that are wholly
unfamiliar to the average person, but the underlying intent and
process are the same. We're talking to God(dess).

I would hazard to say that the witches you've known who publicly
discount magick are dismissing the popular view of a witch waving her
wand and having some immediately visible profound effect on the
mundane world. Like boils, or lame cows. We don't do that - but we do
perform magick, just as Christians pray.


And that's probably the best hour I'll spend today :)
