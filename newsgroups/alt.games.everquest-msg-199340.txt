Haven't we already heard this story once already?

Tell that to my guildie wizards who kite fennin guards (PoFire) and get 26%
aa exp PER MOB.
Wizards haven't been nerfed out of anything.

Imo they are actually one of the strongest classes...  you see, druids are
great soloers but blow on raids.  Necros are great soloers, but have limited
use on raids.  Wizards are awesome soloers, and are truly awesome at raids
too.

Sure they get it rough at early levels, but nerfed/under powered they
certainly aren't.

I see level 65's, on big raids, in elemental Pop zones, asking for (and
using) mage summoned focus items on a virtually daily basis.  That above
comment is completly wrong.

Necros, druids, even mages god forbid, can solo in PoN.  Necros have NP at
all dealing with ravens.

Correction.  YOU couldn't do it.  It can easily be done.  A shaman can solo
here with relative ease.

Root and dot... root and dot..

Bleh don't say whats possible and what isn't based on your own failures.

Like i said...

Anyway I don't mean to be harsh.. but your advice is SO wrong its
potentially damaging to him and his character.

Try different things in the game... you learnt that pet tanking doesn't work
in PoN... so try root dotting.  Try agro kiting with your wizard, dots and
pet.  Try a combo of shaman tanking and root doting.

In other words don't just try the 1 method that you know, and then declare
it "impossible".  Its not impossible at all, your just going about it wrong.
