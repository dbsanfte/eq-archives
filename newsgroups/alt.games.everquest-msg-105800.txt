I'd have to disagree.  I have created a new untwinked char since the
changes went in and even a complete novice to the game would level to 10
in short order, took me just over 3 hours played to hit lvl 9 and I
wasn't hurrying, spent some time chatting with friends and even grouping
with them to kill stuff for fun rather than optimal exp.  Now faced with
CRs, low skills due to rapid leveling and increasingly dangerous targets
many true "newbies" will grow frustrated in their teens even with the
boosted exp rates.  Either VI lowers the bar for the mid level game or
these folks quit and I think we all know how that will work out
considering VI's dedication to integrity over profits <eg>.  You may
soon find yourself looking at your "meaty" mid levels and asking
"where's the beef?"  Only supposition, neither you nor I knows what will
happen down the road, only Ben knows for sure.
