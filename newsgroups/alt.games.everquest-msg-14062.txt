this is why I play everquest. the other players tend to be really helpful
and pleasant.

the only problem is that the game can be overpowering.

I also saved up for a steel weapon. Payed more for it than for the Velium

I always found /auction really intimidating, all these weapons selling for
1500pp, and me with 15 gp!
