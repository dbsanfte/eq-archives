This may not be the best newsgroup for this - failing anyone here
knowing I guess I'll run to CSIPGA.

I'm trying to set up voice-over-internet for my friends and myself.

I know about Gamevoice Share and Roger Wilco - are there any other
shareware voice applications that people can recommend? 

Also, I have a problem with my microphone - if I turn the gain off
then it doesn't pick up my voice well enough, if I turn it on, it's
like I'm shouting in the mic.  This may be a problem of having a 
crap sound chip:  However, can anyone recommend a decent mic. for
this sort of thing that isn't more than about $20 (mail order is
fine).  A non-omni directional mic with variable gain would be nice.

BTW - who thought a headset with an omni directional mic. was a good
idea?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
