I don't have much experience of Luclin to offer advice there but next places
to go would be

Lake of Ill Omen, you will level very quickly to 29/30
Skip Frontier Mountains
Move on to The Overthere and you will level very quickly to high 30's

Around lvl 35 onwards you can move to The Dreadlands and level quickly to
high 40's. Whilst in Dreads you will receive numerous tells to come and
fight in Karnors Castle. The exp in there is very fast and will give you
very good training for Enchanter crowd control skills.
