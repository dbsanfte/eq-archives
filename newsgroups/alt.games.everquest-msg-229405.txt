HOHO! Thank you, you just made the Christmas of this 41-year-old EQ addict
with house and job and refigerator (no ice maker).

I'd play on that server, no question. Not sure about the PoK -- there's
something appealing about travel routes being an issue again -- but that's a
detail. Not sure why to make everything no-drop -- a little free enterprise
does spice things up doesn't it?

A PvP aspect could have some appeal if it was less wide-open (there's some
little part of me that gets an extra charge out of that particular danger).
Er....maybe without the PK points, and with guards attacking PKers like they
kill mobs? Maybe guards react by race/faction to players who have done
damage to other players, meaning that if my dwarf pally runs to a BB guard
the guard will defend me against the dark elf who I've been fighting with?
Whereas if we were fighting in Nektulos Forest it would be the reverse. So
you still have some incentive to try ganking somebody (for their gear and
cash), but its riskier...and if there was no PoK then the travel issue
becomes part of the balance here...could be fun, EQ with an edge. Could also
turn out to be a griefers' paradise, of course.
