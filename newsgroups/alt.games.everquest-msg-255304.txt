I know its a stretch, but if you don't have aggro at all, I mean are not 
on the hate list of the mob, then sneak prevents you getting aggro.  If 
you cast, you aren't sneaking, so thats the end of that... except that 
its possible that the plan involves casting mem blur/atone on the mob, 
which would wipe aggro, so that you could have the casters break sneak, 
cast, then sneak again while someone wipes the mob's mind clean

Sounds like a pain in the butt, and I can't imagine where it would be 
needed... but it seems possible.

I haven't heard that one, and even if it were true, it would be a 
stretch for me to believe it applied to casters and not just to melee.
