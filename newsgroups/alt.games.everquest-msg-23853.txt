Kill a lot of goblins to get non-KoS to the deputies (guards), then go hand
band-aids in to the guy in one of the huts out in Misty thicket to raise
Deeppockets and all the other Halfling factions.  (even if the guy is KoS,
he's only level 8 or so, I think, he went green to me around 15 or so, so
you should still be able to hand them in withought him attacking, but his
wife in the same hut is about 8 levels higher)

Looked it up because I was getting confused...
