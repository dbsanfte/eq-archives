Correct.
A level 60 ranger at haste cap (roughly around 100%) with a fleeting
quiver will have an effective haste of 120% (or there abouts).
Combined with a primal bow + trueshot (get the shaman to cast primal
avatar on you first so you'll chain proc avatar from the bow), the
amount of damage a ranger can generate during the 2 minutes is pretty
sick.

I should get one of our rangers to log his damage against Yelinak next
time...then again, maybe not, it might piss off the dragon baned
wizards.

Nope, only bow delay.
