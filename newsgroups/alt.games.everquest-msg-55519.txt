I got a 3 wis 10 fr 10 cr and 10 mr shoulder
CLR/DRU/SHM  (yeah no ac)

off a wretched mare. We kept getting the earring, often as many as 2
at once then finally got TWO shawls off the same mare then another off
the next one.

That item is darn good at level 55 even for a druid. I got that then
the next day a retiring friend gave me a sarnak battle shield so now
im up to 204 wis and 105 base mr, 100 base fr and 105 base CR all the
time, which is good since I'm mostly in a flexible raiding guild.

I can't think of another single item as good as that shawl which was
so basically easy to get except for uber nuts stuff probably.
