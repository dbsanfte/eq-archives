Did you check how long was left on the corpse?  Unless that zone has some
kind of special super-fast corpse timer or something like that, they had
plenty of time to get around to dealing with loot.

Second, you could have checked the corpse, seen there was something others
might want, and told the group that they needed to ditribute it.  Instead,
you simply take it!?

That sure doesn't look good to the rest of the party.

Third mistake.  If the situation calls for running, let the group leader or
the crowd control people call it, and then evac.  Don't just leave everyone
else to die.
