I have a dell computer running at 1.6ghrz with 512mb of DDR ram and a
40gig harddrive running windows xp home edition.
Now I have a 16mb video card an ati one.

Next week I am updating my video card to a Geforce 4 ti 4200 on
monday.  So today as any good consumer I phoned some of the diffrent
computer store's in my area to get some price information.

Now one store say's they have the Geforce 4 ti 4200 and said it is an
8X agp card. ok no problem. Now here is the thing I got out the old
computer manuel to check the exact specifications of my machine here's
what I came up with.

Expansion BUS

Bus types--->PCI and AGP
BUS SPEED--> Pci:33 mhz Agp:66mhz
AGP Connector--> one
AGP connector size 172 pins
AGP Connector Data Width 32bits
AGP bus Protocols--> 4x/2x modes at 1.5v

Video
Video Controller---->AGP 4x

Now with this setup does this mean I will be unable to use that card
or would it just be a drop in performance from the card Itself.  Any
help on this and reccomendations would be Welcomed. Since I am doing
the shopping for the video card next week.
