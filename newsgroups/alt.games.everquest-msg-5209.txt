Hello all... I have a lvl 18 Shaman as my character. Currently I am hunting
Gnoll Commanders, Elite Gnolls, and other high-lvl spawns in BlackBurrow. I
have been in Oasis of Mar also, where i levelled from 14 to 17. At lvl 19 i
will get my spells in Halas, and head out in the world again.

I have been on Odus, and did not really like the Warrens that much.

Where do you suggest I should lvl to 19, 20, 21 and perhaps more? I heard
East Karana is supposed to be good. And how about the RunnyEye Clan? I think
i can't get TOO much experience from the BlackBurrow gnolls, but the
Split-Paw kinds do give a nice XP and loot!

Maarten
