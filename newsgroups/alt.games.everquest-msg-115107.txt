Id like to encourage any "idiot melee" unfortunate to group with this POS to
forget to press their taunt button the next time this wonderfully group
friendly druid forgets about his aggro control and starts getting beat on.
I think that would be a good lesson for him to learn.

Ever stop to think that some people might be on giant faction and kos?  Not
a druids responsibility to help get a raid out of an area after a fight is
over? You really need to adjust your attitude or you will find yourself one
of those druids that can never find a group, never find a raid and is
limited to just kiting, wow fun.  I guess it might have been all your levels
of soloing that you fine tuned your me-only

Your resist buff is nice, but get over it.  Bard songs kicks its ass, and if
your not well over 100+ fire and cold without druid buff you need to
reconsider your equipment.

Just to recap your situation.. raid wipe, cleric must have camped, came
back, rezzed everyone, a repop had occurred preventing people from just
turning around and walking out, and your bitching and moaning because you
have to bind, and do ports to get the non-gaters out?  I think even Lokari
will agree that is fucking lame.
