I got to do that quest!

I logged in, was asked to port a guildie to EK, we got there just as
the event ended. We went to WC  to chase werewolves with 200 others, I
got bored so I decided to go back to Freeport and make some skewers
and then maybe check on EK later...

I was in EFP and had just bought skewer molds when I saw Deacon
Gallius shout for people to come hear his sad tale. I'd wanted to go
on a real GM event for a long time, so I made a beeline for the docks
and was the first person to get there. He was a human paladin of
Erollisi Marr, and had been a sailor between Freeport and
Butcherblock. His ship had been attacked by an evil force in the Ocean
of Tears and he had lost many friends, thinking them dead. Now he had
discovered they were still around in the form of evil, unholy ghoulish
creatures, and he needed help to free them from their misery.

So, we sat around and talked with Deacon, rounded up some people (I
even managed to persuade a monk friend on CR to come, he'd died at the
Rathe mt. event and just happened to be bound in East Freeport :) )
and waited for the right boat to OOT. We were roughly 30 when Deacon
said we had enough; half a dozen from my guild, a bunch from another
guild, and some other people.

The 'right' boat arrived, we went to Sister Island to prepare as
Deacon's powers would be the strongest there, and waited for a ghost
ship. The Deep Tomb arrived, we got on board, the ship started moving
and then turned invisible. We stood around on the invisible ship, some
fell off. Deacon said that he could only tell the ship where to go,
not how to perform, and that the illusion of floating in mid air was
just evil out to get us :). The ship stranded on spectre island, but
seemed to start moving again when I moved slightly. More people fell
off and lost each other, and the boat seemed to be heading for the
middle of nowhere - Deacon was still on it, so I didn't do anything.
Suddenly Deacon disappeared from my track and then shouted that evil
had tricked us and sent the boat astray, and proceeded to summon
everyone to the spectre island with the power of Erollisi - while I
waited for summon, I got 3 swimming points by running just above the
water with levitate :)

Once everyone was on spectre island, we waited while Deacon talked
with the ghosts, trying to save them with love and friendship and his
magics - he failed, of course (my sk Zavijah would have loved this
quest ;) ) and we attacked and killed the spectres and his shipmates
with only two casualties. The two named sailors were blue to 53, the
deck hand and the spectres were green. The shipmates dropped FS, light
burlap bag, some kind of cloak and other relatively low end items.

After the sailors were dead, Deacon rezzed the two casualties and then
shouted for  a level 40 rogue (he was one of the first to show up and
his guild was the other one with a noticeable presence) to seek him
out, and he also wanted to talk with *me*.  He thanked us for our
honorary service and our devotion to Erollisi Marr, said the gods
would remember our names as outstanding citizens of Norrath - and gave
me a Heirophant's Cloak! I did manage to stay civil while talking with
Deacon, but after I looked at the cloak, nobody else got much other
than #"ï¿½%"!!!! from me for a minute or so :) That cloak is one of the
things I have wanted the most, both for the stats and for the cool
name, so I was pretty much shellshocked to get it like that :)
(Tonight, I am going to look for the rogue and ask what he got, it was
probably something equally nice, and it's all the nicer that he got
something since he's a self-made and very untwinked rogue :) )

It was a great event, even with the bugged ghost ship. The GM took it
in stride with treating the bugs as Evil Interference(tm), there were
no zergling rushes, no attempts to attack Deacon or take things ooc,
and nobody tried to attack the mobs before we were supposed to.
