There not lore by the way, so you can dual weild if you want. The Chimp
spent quite a bit of time in Stonebrunt collecting etched iron armour (basic
plate - but <heavy>) and built up quite a collection of tiger skins. After
looking up what they were used for he went ape one day and got a swag of
panda claws as well. Without faction to do the quest himself - he latched
onto a druid farming the Waki quest  to barter, and got 4 shiney new Waki's
out of the bargain.

My baby ranger isn't big enough to proc 'em yet, but once one she is they
will be her dual wielding weapons for quite a while. The other two Chimp
plans on giving to gnolls in Blackburrow once he finishes farming some more
Blackened Alloy for the same purpose.

Playing at the opposite timezone to the US has it's rewards, I get Runnyeye
to myself : )
