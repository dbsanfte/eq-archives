I did the same thing with no luck.  After upgrading to DirectX 9, I went
into the game.  The screen was very dark.  Tyring to adjust the gamma in the
options menu was no help.  I downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers and
installed them.  Then when I went back into the game I still had a dark
display and adjusting the gamma slider control in the display options did
nothing.  I tried to get technical support from EQ and they said that they
do not officially support DirextX 9 and I would have to contact Microsoft.
