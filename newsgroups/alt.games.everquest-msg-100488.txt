Well, the thing is...  You drive down the price when you don't change the
product.  Hence the cost of Quake and such is at a low price, because the
newer product or competition provides more.  Everquest, on the otherhand,
is a product that has been expanding.  If you look at the cost of D&D
material, you don't see it going down, but going up with inflation as it
is.  What people are paying for, in essense, is the base rules, the
expansions accordingly, then the monthly updates in order to play.  Given
it has been $9.95 a month for 3 years with a modestly growing group...  The
areas mentioned by Valien isn't actually getting cheaper, it is getting
expensive as well.  The demand and the fact they are now running another
division in Europe so European players have something a little closer to
home, suggests costs should be rising.  And while it is a 30% increase, as
another poster mentioned, compare 30% to your ISP bill if you pay one, or
your Phone bill, or you cable tv bill.  Hell, look at the Post Office.  I
heard that we may go from $.34 to $.37...  That's a 10% increase from the
3% increase from before, and people are attributing that to loss of sales
due to the Internet's Email.  Go figure.

Re-read Valien's mentioning of reasons why:  More content, More usage, more
Bandwidth.  More users, requires more content for the older users to find
something to do, More usage due to more users, more bandwidth to support
the current and new users.  As more users come in, I am sure you want to be
able to play at the same level of network speed, not watch it go down
because the pipe can't handle the current load.
