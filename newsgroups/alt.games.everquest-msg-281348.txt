I was responding in terms of previous /claim rewards, like the LDoN bag, 
the GoD stick, and the OoW wand, and so forth, not PoP flags or 
something. 

Buying LDoN (boxxed) entitled you to CLAIM a bag once; it didn't entitle 
you to actually HAVE a bag; so if you deleted it, or the character it 
was on you permanently lose it.

I think the same goes for vet-rewards. For each year subscribe you may 
CLAIM the rewards with one more character. That's it. Once you claim it 
it will stay with that character until you delete the character... and 
it will be deleted along with that character. (Inasmuch as characters 
are actually deleted of course)

That's pretty much what /claim does. It moves the reward from your 
account and assigns it to a character. In a sense, I suppose /claim 
moves rewards from account based to toon based.
