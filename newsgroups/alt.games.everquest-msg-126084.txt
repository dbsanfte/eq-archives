I'll preface this by saying that I have no idea what would be involved
in this from either the difficulty of coding aspect, or the legal
problems.  But I do know that the company I currently contract for has
their own proprietary instant messaging program. They have it tied into
AIM/Netscape Messenger so that you can log into *both* from their one
application and send/receive messages to people on your friends list
from inside theirs.

I wonder if AIM /tells are possible?
