Since Sony has made a lot of changes to EQ over the years, I think it would
be very cool if they were to reveal the answers to some of the mysteries
regarding how the game used to work, in the old days.  In particular, I'd
love to see offical answers to the following questions:

1. How did the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro work?  Random spawn?
Placeholders?  Something more complex?

2. How did Pyzjin and the Glowing Black Stone in Qeynos Hills work?  If she
spawned and wasn't killed right away, she seemed to be involved in some
scripted events, that seemed to tie in to quests relating to Befallen.  One
site claimed that if you let things play out, instead of killing her right
away, you could always get the GBS.  If you simply killed her, it was just a
random drop.  What's the real story here?

3. That Pegasus in South Karana--same questions.

I think all the zones and mobs and quests involved have been changed
sufficiently over the years that answering these questions would not give
away anything relevant to the current game.

Anyone care to ask these questions on Sony's forums, and see if maybe
they'll answer?
