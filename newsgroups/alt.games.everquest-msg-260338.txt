That was a problem with not having enough zones for the size of the
player base. It has nothing to do with dumbing down the game and
making it exponentially easier than it once was.

Nope. That's why I said I preferred a game that was "2-3" on the
scale. Some of the early limitations (like book medding) sucked beyond
belief.

>Mouse input for numerical values was fun too.

Please point out where I said the original state of EQ was perfect,
