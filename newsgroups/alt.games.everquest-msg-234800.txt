First number is your "ping" time, in milliseconds.  This is how long
it takes data to do a round-trip from the server to your computer and
back again (or vice versa).  The lower the better, 0-300 is typical.
When it gets really high you'll see a lot of "delayed reaction" stuff
in the game, where you'll issue a command and then nothing will 
happen for a little while, *then* it'll respond.  The usual cause
is a sluggish internet channel which keeps data in a holding pattern
for too long before passing it along to each new switching station.
This can also happen when the EQ server gets overloaded and can't 
keep up with the game-world changes in realtime.

Next two numbers are your inbound/outbound packet loss percentages.
This is the number of packets sent to/from your computer which never
arrive at the other end for some reason and have to be re-sent.
Should be zero most of the time.  Noisy phone lines is the usual
culprit if not, or a crappy modem, problems on the internet, etc.

The green line (actually, two green lines, each starting in the middle
and flowing outward to both ends) below those numbers is a graphical
representation of the packet losses.  Lost packets show up as gaps
in the lines.

Last number is the average amount of data flowing across the line between
you and the server, in bytes per second.  Low number means not much is
happening, high numbers are not bad, they just indicate that there's
a lot of game info that has to be kept synchronized (like movements of
lots of people/mobs around you, spell/emote/text messages, visual spell
effects that have to be triggered on your screen, etc.)  When the number
gets way too high it can overload your internet connection (especially on
a dialup) and cause the first number (ping time) to start rising because
the data flow gets "backlogged" for a while until it catches up.
