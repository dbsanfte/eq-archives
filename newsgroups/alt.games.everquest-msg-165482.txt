Nothing wrong with a grouping Druid -actually at higher levels,though not a
necessity, you will find grouping makes the game in many ways more rewarding
(in platinum as well as the social aspects). My main is a Druid at 53 and to
get through a large chunk of the 30 to 50 experience I grouped with folks in
Marus Seru, Dawnshroud and for the occasional change up there are some nice
spots in Echo Caverns - particularly around the areas Fireclaw and Xilinov
Spawn. For solo time- I developed my kiting and root dotting techniques on
Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains or in East Karana (just watch out for Tarbul
Earthstrider). For better information - you can try the guides and or forums
at eqdruids.com - they are able to provide you details that my old foggy
memory cannot provide. Hope this helps and good luck to you!!
