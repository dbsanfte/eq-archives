If they're already better, and you've got some of the SoL/PoP upgrades,
gettting stuff with Vengence V or the like won't be much of a problem.
You'd waste more time getting your guild's level 50ish alts together
for a V'Ghera raid than it's worth.

RB is still THE weapon for 80% of rogues out there, but the SoL and
PoP piercers along with the new Vengence + armors and slots make
it "leave-behindable" at that level of play.  For the person grouping with
his casual guild, using Silver Chitin Hand Wraps and a 13/26 piercer,
it's still THE weapon to get.

Good luck finding a Dart, though...on E. Marr they don't drop that much...
