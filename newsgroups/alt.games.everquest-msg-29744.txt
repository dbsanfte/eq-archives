YMMV but that was what i was finding, If i stood right at
the zone line i could get my pet off with out aggro, but on
moving in your pretty much guaranteed a two mob attack. 
sometimes i could zone, sometimes i just got stunned and
died.

I would use root, only because i didn't want to have to
melee stuff.  I usually find that i have time with clinging
darkness in a good situation, to pull with it, send the pet,
cast another dot or so and then i need to recast it.  I am
usually fear kiting though, so i want to make sure i don't
have it drop.

I may go back, but I gave up at level 6 on Toxx, got a port
to Butcherblock and have been fighting goblins, and undead
mostly.  I got two levels the day i ported after getting
about a bub on Odus in a week.  I did get in a decent group
with a couple of friends who were like two levels higher
than me, one being a ranger, so we never had much of a wait
for pulls.  And with me having clinging and fear we could
take yellow/red basilisks without the stun problems easily. 
At 8 i can pull from the chessboard in butcherblock,
provided i can get solos and take yellows with ease.  

Once I hit 12 or so I may go back to the Warrens, not sure.

I don't know about it being all that salable, it's not bad
for newbie loot, but the better items i think are no drop
class specific.  The filth covered boots were nice, I think
they are like ac 7 or so, and have sta on them if IIRC.  I
just take them off to sell.  They were way better than what
my druid was wearing at the time.

Yes with relative safety, you will still get jumped by some
of the mobs, pretty much any named, the pit fighters, and
the trainers, but alot of those are easily avoided.
