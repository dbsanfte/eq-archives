> I think the biggest problem is the putzes selling plat for $$$ ...

I'm curious. Is that comment directed solely at the dupers introducing
counterfeit plats into the economy and then turning them into real-world
cash (creating huge incentives for cheating) or are you saying that plat
selling in general is a problem?

I'm not asking about or commenting on the EULA issue or denying that SOE has
the right to take action against plat sellers, let's assume these are a
given. My question is on the topic of plat sellers in general and what
impact you think they have on the game. This is a whole new area of activity
that didn't exist when I first started playing but I noticed when I returned
after a 2-year absence.
