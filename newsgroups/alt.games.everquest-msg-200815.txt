For what it's worth, I used to have mega problems crashing left and right.
I was using a Soundblaster Live Platinum card, and it seemed to be the root
of all evil.  I tried updating the drivers for it and several other AGE
recommended tweaks, but alas, kept crashing.  On a whim, just to test
theory, I disabled the sound card and was able to play uninterrupted until I
decided to log for the night.  I got tired of dealing with the problems and
replaced the sound card with a different one.

Long story short, I may have had a defective sound card, maybe not...I
replaced it and runs great now w/o crashing.  I'm running over a gig of RAM,
but that never seemed to be an issue.

This may help you, maybe not...but worth a try, who knows.  Good luck.
