Not really its attitude, let me show you. Read though my comments and
look for a hidden example.

It is a good indicator for the type of people I want to be with. You
dont have to be smart, or selfless, or imaginative. I want people to
be polite, and have respect for others.

I want a good time, and some guy acting the "fool" ruins it for me.
Doodspeak and naming ruins the immersive effect of the EQ universe. My
OP said that people judge you.

The name "oobahdeathguy killjoo"  says to me that could be someone who
may not be the the best person for me to group with. I may invite
them, then again I may not.

Ok, your point is "I will put up with a lot so I can win"? To me dps
isn't the be all and end all. I would rather have a Paladin there if
he is ready to play and agrees to share loot. I would not want a
ninjalooting, foulmouthed, egomaniac, and AFK rogue in my party. I
would rather spend more time slowly leveling with people I like than
PLing with people I despise.

The whole game is about spending time in the EQ world, not mastering
the EQ world without taking time to smell the roses.

No, the game is there to enjoy with people you like. I have friends
with dumb names, I am referring to the whining from the "dumb name
supporters" who complain that people judge them for the choices they
make. Those people tell me I have no right to judge them based on the
stupid choices they make.

Okay, I cant understand your first sentence. It doesn't form a
complete thought and contains a profanity. Making assumptions on my
behavior is a straw man arguement, and doesn't support your point.

There is a point here. I know what you wanted to convey, if I were to
dismiss your friend for his name, I would have lost the friendship of
a fine person.

You see, your presentation got in the way of the good arguement you
make. You have a bad supporting thought, the straw man, but the
sentiment is a good one.

Let me comment on one more thing. The use of numbers for words bothers
me because it shows you can't be bothered to take three keystrokes and
spell
o-n-e. 

It is like using 4 for 
f-o-u-r 
or 
f-o-r. 

I never understood why it is used in writing. Of course, YMMV :-)

My original point is people will judge you for the way you
communicate. Naming yourself, your writings, and presentation all do
that. I hope my OP is clearer.
