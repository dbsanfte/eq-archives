And yet you were so ready to abuse me for displaying what you *thought* 
was a preference for Australians. Hypocrite.

What a witty display of profound vocabulary skills this diatribe is. I 
am in awe.

So they deserved to die?

Keep in mind that while Australians are being airlifted to first world 
class hospitals, these hostpitals ARE in Australia and they ARE 
Australians after all. Your anger should be directed towards the 
Indonesian government for not providing their citizens with world class 
hospitals, rather than at the Australian victims in this.

Are you watching TV in Indonesia? Oh you're not? You're watching TV in 
Australia? And they're focusing on Australians huh? How strange!
