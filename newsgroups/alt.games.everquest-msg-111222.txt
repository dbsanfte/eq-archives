Stonebrunt is a shocker for wandering adds - the entire zone is chock full
of aggro wanderers on seemingly brownian motion pathing. Rotting is pretty
difficult to do - I would say kiting would be extremely hard close to
impossible until a lot of the stuff is greening out at least.

The animal spawning in the zone seems to be like a fountain - huge (as in
avalanching) spawns in the centre of the zone and they disperse radially out
from it bouncing all over the place. The centre of the zone regularily snows
under blue conning warrior Gimps - he starts a 1 one 1 - gets an add and
within 3-4 minutes there are 4-5 on him. Definately stick to an edge.

Up north close to the top wall the cats seem to be a bit tougher but there
is a relative "bare strip" along the wall where careful kiting may work. I
really should stress the word "relative" though, but at least you would get
a chance to med easy enough up there. You have to keep them from straying
off the wall carefully and watch out for the (Raging/) Highland Kobold camps
but they are stationary and easy to avoid.

Then again - maybe my lack of Kunark experience has caused me to fall behind
in the "eyes in the back of the head" skillset and it's not as difficult as
I seem to think - tough call. Try a bit of rotting first, see how you go.
You could also have a look down by the beach - I didn't check that area out
much at all so there could be better spots down there I missed entirely.

Cheers
