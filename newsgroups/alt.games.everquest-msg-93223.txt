You're safe in all the Dark Elf portions of Neriak. I would avoid the
Troll/Ogre section of the Foreign Quarter, being a human.

BUT, cast invis vs. undead on yourself before going to the Lodge Of The
Dead, or the Ghouls that guard the entrance will stomp holes through you.

Butcherblock=KOS
Gfay=KOS
Oggok=KOS
Grobb=KOS
Ak'Anon=KOS except in the Necro guild
Qeynos=Probably Dubious, but look out
Erudin=KOS. Not sure about Paineel.
