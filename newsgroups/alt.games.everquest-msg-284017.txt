Hmm, I'm having second thoughts.  I could have sworn I read this in a 
patch message (although I still make sure I have food because the 
message bugs me) but I just spent 40 minutes going back through them 
all, and can't find it.

It's possible I'm confused with EQ2, for which I was in the Beta for a 
while and now have recollections of them changing how food worked in that.

I've asked on the EQ forums for clarification.  So far I appear to be 
the only one who remembers it changing in EQ which doesn't look good for 
my theory ;)
