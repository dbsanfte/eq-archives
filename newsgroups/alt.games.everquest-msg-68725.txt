For some strange reason.. I predict the following items will be lowering in
price either just a little or dramatically here soon:

1.  Pegasus Cloak
2.  Fish Bone Earring
3.  Glowing Black Stone
4.  Leggings from VS
5.  Confidence levels of druids and ranger have in getting their stones from
VSR <grin>


Please do add to the list.. as Im sure and know there are many others...
hehe.. naw, things wont lower TOO much in price.. but low enough.

I guess the PC of the FBE's have dramatically decreased since the Surefall
Glade port spell has been released for obvious reasons.  Same with #3 I
suppose.

Sorry.. really had nothing better to talk about beside this.. <grin>  I
certainly hope they do concentrate on problems that people are experiecing
instead of nerfindg things... but.. whatever..
