Your zone time is a factor here.  And perception > all.  I've taken the run
many times, even with a wizard buddy who could just as easily have come pick
me up.  But it is still numerous zone crossings and a bit of a pain.  My
bard found that he could cross Warrens in one Selos burst -if- he didn't
stop to sightsee.

That doesn't mean that people don't see getting to LOY as a pain in the
wazoo and that their perception of how long it takes to get there isn't a
factor in how many are willing to go there to fight as opposed to somewhere
easy to reach.  DL is highly populated in part because there are lots of
ways to get there fast; druid/wizard port, Luclin pyramid, FV book located
in the tunnel to DL; something's drawing people there and it sure isn't the
loot (oooh, bronze armor) exp (about half what you get in Gunthak or any
dungeon for killing the same level mobs) or the civility of ooc
conversation!

Getting to the "other" zones takes even longer, you have to cross Gunthak,
which of course is a mix of dead and undead.  Now I've found its actually
simple enough to get past the undead by hugging the right hand wall crossing
the beach, and so run the whole way invis, but most people seem to feel its
simpler to just train half the zone to whichever zone line they are heading
for.

I bet if they put in a POK book to Gunthak the population of the LOY zones
would double.. heck, I don't think most people who -own- LOY have even tried
the place yet, most people don't seem to realize (for example) that there's
a soulbinder and a bank right there at the lighthouse in Gunthak (they ask
me if its possible to bind them outside in Stonebrunt or if they have to go
all the way back to Paineel for the closest bindable spot)
