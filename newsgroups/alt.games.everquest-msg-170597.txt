Probably because I do try to learn from the liberals.  The way I figure is
that I don't have to worry if they disagree with me.  If their argument
carries water, then it will be show through with dilligent analysis..  If
it's full of bovine refuse, that will be apparent as well.

Not all of them.  I think the conservatives have made some distance between
ourselves and the extremists like Pat Robertson and David Duke (who isn't
even smart enough to realize that nobody wants him).  As far as Clarence
Thomas, Ronald and Mike Reagan, or Dubya, I have no problem letting them
speak for me.  You can also listen to Ken Hamblin, G. Gordon Liddy, or J. C.
Watts and hear what we have to say.  Hell, even Limbaugh isn't too far off
the mark, if you actually take the time to sit down and listen to what he
says, as opposed to what others say for him.

How about the liberals?  Where are your spokesmen?  What I'm trying to get
at, is that I attack a liberal position, and all I get is "we don't really
believe that."  If that's the case, than you guys have got to do something
about those who claim to represent you, since they're doing everything in
their power to disgrace you.  If Jessie Jackson, or Kweisi Mfume don't
represent the liberal stance on race, who does?  Of all those I listed
above, the only one I can actually say I have any respect for is Peter
Jennings.  Do his views represent the rank and file?

Maybe not fair, but it does have the side-effect of pushing the focus back
towards the neutral.

It's been over a decade since I read any of her work, but I think you're
quite oversimplifying her position.

"Enough" is relative.  Small things have a way of ballooning if there is a
need for them.

I see antitrust laws as pruning back the worst excesses of the tree.
They're what keep it healthy.  Competition is the essence of a free-market
economy; it's what represent's the interests of the customers.  If the
market is allowed to bypass competition, it will fail.
