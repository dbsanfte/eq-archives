My little gnome enchanter was fun while she looked cute running around
pretending to be other races.  Now I have clarity, and while it's nice,  I'm
very disappointed in this class.  I can't do much other than buff.  I feel like
a glorified, or not so glorified water girl when grouped.  I don't mind, but
really!  I thought I would get more action.  Every caster has some decent DD
and area spells.  Am I missing something, or have I worked on a class soon to
be obsolete?  I'm very near to deleting this character out of frustration.  I
can make jewelry, enchant plat and electrum, but no one wants to pay much for
it.  I am spending a fortune on learning the jewelry craft, and find that the
costs of supplies and the lack of demand hardly make it worth it - I may break
even IF I work real hard ;)

Some feedback would be appreciated about now.

Thanks
