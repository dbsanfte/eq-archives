Where the hell were you pulling? Outdoors you should never EVER come 
with 8. Indoors you should not be pulling.

Gotta know when to heal em, know when to let em fold. Also, that's what 
DA is for.

First almost right answer. Offtank while the CC is working, FD if you 
get to low and healing isn't coming.
btw where did 6 and 7 get to? Actually, I'm sure that 7 is in prison for 
murder, because 7 8 9. <bad bad bad Tyas... no cookie for you.>
> 9. Enchanter - Cast AE mez and get killed by the 7 that resisted it.
Toss quick root at the pile as incoming.
Charm another, sic it on a third.
Step next to the agro magnet.. er cleric, start chaining AE-stuns 
interspersed with mezzes and roots.
Line em up, debuff them, and thank the puller for the buffet.

Why call off pet. Get the roots flying there buddy.

Swarm kiting. Swarm kiting.

You got time to gate you got time to evac. Even better, you got time to 
Root. and Snare. Chanter may need some help for some reason. Maybe not, 
it's only 8...

You should know when to evac, and when not to. If you don't, watch the 
enchanter's spam, he'll tell you. Or he dies and it's time to leave.

Second reasonable action on this entire list. If the situation warrants, 
go for it.
