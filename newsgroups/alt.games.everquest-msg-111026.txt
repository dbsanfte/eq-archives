Time to dispell a myth again.  After the changes which got rid of
the hybrid XP penalty, there is no such thing as a higher level
"sucking" exp.   XP is divided based on level (I.E. duo a 43 with
a 37, the 43 gets 43/80 of the xp, the 37 gets 37/80 of the xp).
Since the lower levels require far less xp to get a level, the 
apparent xp per kill (how much of a blue) is way bigger for the 
lower level than the higher.

My 55 ranger friend has a cleric buddy who stopped playing for
a while, she's 37 ( just high enough to group with us).  We were
fighting down in the Hole.  Each spawn cycle is worth less than
1/4 blue to a 54, the 37 was getting a yellow (this is every 21
minutes).

I'd assume he means Cannabalizing - at level 24 shaman
get a spell that exchanges health for mana - making it
very worth while to twist in Hymn for him.
