I used to read for entertainment, still do when I'm offline for extended
periods of time... but its in no way a cheaper hobby than EQ.  New book runs
me about $6 US.  Reading slowly, I go thru about two books a day.  EQ costs
what, $15 per month, plus about $60 per year in expansions?  So 20 bucks, or
about a day and a half of books.  I spend more than $20 a month just having
something to read in bed!

I really can't think of a cheaper form of entertainment.  My cable bill is
higher.  Mountain climbing costs more than that in US State park parking
fees.  Movies? Spend more than that on popcorn plus a tickets for two.
Karate is running me $40 a month plus another $40 for my daughter.  Heck, I
can't even take a family of four to McDonalds for what I spend on EQ in a
month.

The only thing that beats it is old fashioned board games or better, pen and
paper RPG's, where your cost is once and done but you keep on generating
more entertainment for yourself.  Sadly, my friends have all generally
outgrown RPGs or moved out of the area, EQ provides me with a pool of
potential friends who -are- interested in playing, there's always someone
on, and geography is no issue.

I see it as a pretty good deal, although I can certainly also see that other
MMOGs have the potential to be the same excellent deal; so far EQ's content
has amused me much longer than anything else I've tried in the past.

(thats post beta but pre ROK, for anyone who was wondering)
