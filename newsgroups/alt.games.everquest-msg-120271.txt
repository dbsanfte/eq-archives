You know, up until yesterday, I had refused to have a Magelo profile, or
in fact to have anything to do with Magelo.  This was for two basic
reasons:

First, I had a terrible time even trying to look at anybody else's
profile, say nothing of create one, with my previous browsers. It's only
with a recent upgrade to my copy of Internet Exploder that I'm able to
deal with the site's interface at all.

But moreso, if I'd made one before it probably would have been for
Jakugg. Now mind you, it's not that I couldn't have handled the derisive
howls of laughter from warriors as low as level 25 when they looked at
my pathetic kit. I've got a good sense of humor and could handle that.
No, it was more because I knew that if I made one, someday, be it
through desperation, depression, or despair, I would have succumbed to
the temptation to take a peek at Ben Wilson's profile. And I simply
can't afford the cost of an entire new computer system after I smashed
mine into a pile of rubble on my office floor.

But for my wizard it's different. We're not so equipment dependent as
the melees. (Not that good gear isn't nice, we're just not quite as
enslaved to it.)  In fact, I'm assured by some experienced folks on
Graffe's that with my current Kit, without obtaining one new item
(excpet spells, of course) I could quite happily make it from 40 to 60
soloing, grouping, or raiding, and be quite acceptably effective. So
gear envy isn't such an issue.

So without further ado, James, (and anyone else who wants to suggest an
improvement or two) I give you the brand new magelo profile of my
wizard, current as of last night:

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=243664

Oh, I was off on the INT stat. (must have had a buff on). My INT is
sitting at 203, but the 3rd shawl quest will take it to 207, so I think
I still have some room to fudge around a bit.  There's no picture or
background yet, nor anything fancy. Just the gear. As to your questions
about price, etc., well, most of my fortunes were flushed into Jakugg's
blacksmithing really, and I'm nearly broke. If it's something for me to
buy at auction, I'd consider shopping for an item for under 1 KPP if it
was a big boost to my mana pool.  Probably looking more at a hunting
option, though. Either something I can hunt for myself with Jakiss, or
for a tougher goal, something that can be nabbed by, say.... two full
groups of mid fifties. I'm NOT going to try to call out a full blown
guild raid with allies just to get some item for my twink. But I've
spent enough nights and weekends getting Shield of Bane Warding, Epics,
etc. for a bunch of my friends that I'm sure I can round up the usual
list of suspects to help me up my mana on the wizzie.
