We did the same thing at work.  Except that we
have a general EQ folder on the network and once
the T3 line picked it up, everybody just recopies
the patched files over their old ones.  Then
we can connect and play (did I mention my
main's guild has a core of 30+ folks that all
work in the same building and can often finish
up raids in the same room or pair of connecting
rooms? ;-)  )
