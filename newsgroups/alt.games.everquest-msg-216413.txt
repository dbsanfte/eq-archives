Given that level has no effect on stats...

I started my shaman out with 95 wisdom I believe.  Any minor variations 
that are caused by where you allocated your starting points are easily 
correctable with equipment nowadays.  When I was level 50, my wisdom was 
still under 200.  Now, it is maxxed with no AAs spent yet on increasing the 
cap.
