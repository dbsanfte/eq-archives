I'll admit I don't know the high-level game yet, but I think the
argument is that casters do NOT have a huge variety of NEW spells
at, say, level 70.  The comparison would be to imagine if there
were about a dozen items that are specifically available to a
Warrior at required level 70, available only as rare drops and/or
from raids, and at least, oh, 4-6 of those items make a huge
difference to the effectiveness of the Warrior compared to any
other items they might have.  Usually, for the melees, they can
find other gear that gives them a significant fraction of the same
effectiveness.  Thus, a melee type can go a variety of places and
end up with, if not the most effective gear, at least something
that comes close, whereas a caster who doesn't spend an eternity
in the rune-dropping zones will never come anywhere close to being
as effective as a caster who's managed to get the spell drops.

I can't speak to how accurate this perception is, but have I at
least gotten the argument straight?
