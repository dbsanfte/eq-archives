Trolls are best ignored. The more you repsond to his moronic
postings, the more he has to "feed" on.

Keep him in your Kill File and move on.

I had just cleaned my KF for "shits & giggles" and now I know
why I had this moron in it! It is obvious he is a stalker. It is
obvious that he is no benefit to this group.

And welcome to my KF again Avenger!

You 43 year old pussy poopyhead!
