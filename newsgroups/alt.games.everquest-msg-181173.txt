As far as I can tell the last two are and always have been identical.
You can change the range (zoom) and horizontal angle (pan) using the
mouse (you do it by right-click/hold and moving mouse left/right to
pan or forward/back to zoom).  You can change the vertical level using
ALT+UPARROW/DOWNARROW.  The vertical angle is determined by vertical
level and how far your POV is from the character (you are always
looking straight at your character's eyes in the pan/zoom modes).  I
usually have one at or near the lowest vertical level (character's eye
level) and one at a higher angle so I don't often have to adjust when
I want a different POV.
