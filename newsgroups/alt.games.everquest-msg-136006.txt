Ok...

Drakkel Icegrinder, 27dmg 45dly, modal damage (caster) of 55.
This one's from Velious.  The initial two-hander upgrades were
already in game when Velious opened, and decent two-handers
were as common as white rice by then as well.  Any Paladin
close to your level at this time that you actually outdamaged
(as opposed to appear to outdamaged) was:
a) training a new weapon skill
b) woefully ignorant (i.e. equipping total crap weapons)
c) a blithering idiot (willfully refusing to equip effective weapons)
d) all of the above
By the time Velious came out Paladins under L50 were no longer
pathetic, just a bit inferior.  Over 50 they fell farther and
farther behind the other melees, but you're speaking of low to
mid 40s.

Runewood Great Staff, 22dmg 40dly, modal damage (caster) of 45.
This one's from Kunark.  You could've been using it prior to
the first two-handed weapon upgrade, so let's compare it with the
Runic Carver, a not uncommon 2-hander of that era that would've
been a poor weapon for a paladin of that level, and to Ghoulbane,
the generic paladin one-hander.  Assume no haste item and the old
damage bonus:

Runic Carver, 18dmg 37dly, modal damage (at L40) of 41 gives very
similar modal ratio to the staff (41:37 vs. 45:40).  But wait, the
paladin has Double Attack, increasing his number of attacks by over
40%, and he's on a better damage table (unknown how much benefit
this gives).

Ghoulbane, 15dmg 34dly, modal damage (at L40) of 35 gives a noticeably
inferior modal ratio (35:34 vs. 45:40), but again the Paladin gets
more than 40% more attacks than you do.

It is worth noting also that average damage per hit was likely closer
to [base*1.5+bonus] than to the modal, which would actually favor the
Paladins even more.

In conclusion, even before most of the improvements to the hybrids
and two-handers a Paladin should have routinely outdamaged you by
a significant amount.  If he didn't, he wasn't playing his character
worth a damn in terms of his contribution to melee (i.e. he was not
making sure that he had reasonable equipment).

Oh, and on the subject of "missing" melee messages, others have
commented on this in other threads, and I've noticed it myself.
I've had my log showing that I was outdamaging a Monk three levels
higher than my Paladin, which I knew to be absurd both in theory
and from how the fight went (I had to work hard to keep agro).
All I can think of for an explanation is that there is a limit to
the amount of bandwidth the server will use to send you messages
and that "other's hits/misses" are at the bottom of the priority
list for what it sends.

P.S.  I enjoy reading your posts, btw, I just couldn't see any way
for your claim to be true (as opposed to appearing to be true from
your perspective).  Of course, I was assuming the Paladins in question
were at least marginally competent.
