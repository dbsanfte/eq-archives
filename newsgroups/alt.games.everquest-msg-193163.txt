I really would like to know the source for this info myself. Given
that all the gamers I know buy games regularly, but run on systems a
year old or more. Matter of fact, I only know a handful of people
(Well enough to get into computer discussions with, that is. Not
counting co-workers I don't talk to often...) who have bought a
computer within the past year, and none of them were gamers.

It's been my experience that gamers tend to upgrade their systems to
meet game requirements rather than game requirements upgrading to meet
the systems that their markets have. As a matter of fact, last time
most of my gamer friends bought new systems, it was specificly because
of the fact it was getting to where their systems couldn't run any of
the new games coming out.
