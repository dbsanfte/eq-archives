I've been mistaken about things I expected to be consistent about
EQ once too often to trust generalizations like that anymore.

If that were actually true I'd expect some Barb to have piped up
by now with comments similar to the many who have reported that
they too drink more in NRo/SRo/Oasis, so it seems unlikely to me.

If so, the effect is not large.  I've been half convinced at times that
mountains and/or continuous fighting result in heavier food consumption.
But I've never proved any of these to be true (or false), nor am I aware
of anybody else who has done so.

What you or I (or anybody else) thinks "makes sense" is of limited
interest to the EQ designers wrestling with balance issues.  The
force-feeding mechanic did two things that I am aware of, it gave
foraging classes something to do with all that extra food/drink
(probably not important at all to the designers) and it made stat
food/drink economicly viable for most of the player population (I
suspect that this is why it was added).  [Note, balance above
refers to trade-skills, not classes.]
