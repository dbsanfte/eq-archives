Now I feel really guilty. I was simply pointing out that there were some
groups of derv/bandit level mobs that were generally uncamped and
sometimes used for cash farming. I was guessing you'd be able to pull
them singly at range and it sounds like you could. I was higher than 19
when I first encountered them so I don't know exactly *how* green they
are, and was assuming that you would con them first, and take steps to
avoid pulling them all at once (like not either not sitting in the
middle of them, or getting someone to harmony them or something).

Sorry if I incited you to act suicidally :)
