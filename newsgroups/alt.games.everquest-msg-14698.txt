Levelling really isnt that hard. The hardest task is finding a zone where
the mobs give you the best experience and getting into a full group to kill
them. I have a level 24 ranger in my group who was level 9 only 1 month ago.
I have no idea how much she plays. I have a wizard who leapt up in levels at
the oasis and the lake and is now 22.
Its more a question of using your time wisely. If you want to just level,
try hard to get into groups that are good.

Personally i think you are better off leveling at a slow rate and exploring
the game fully.
