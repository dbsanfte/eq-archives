Yeah I did the Magic thing for a while too!!
I managed to collect full sets of nearly all the expansions after fallen
empires up till saga block.
No clue where they are now though :(
I gave it up because wizards of the coast focused on Type II tournaments
which made the value of the older cards pretty much nothing bcause noone
would play you unless you had a type 2 deck, that really pissed me off after
I strived hard to get these cards which became useless.
Lets hope Verant dosnt make a similar stupid move that causes loss of its
many players, dont forget that ultimately we the players make that company
(same for most companies really) and maintaining a strong community allows
us to make decisions about what we want.
If everyone decided that they wanted the level limit increased to 65, and
everyone stopped paying for their accounts until it was, verant would be
screwed.
They have nicely placed an addictive streak to the game that will probably
prevent that from ever happening as the player feels dependant on them. Look
how many people get pissed of on patch day because they cant  play for a few
hours.

Some great strategic marketing by Sony.

Thats just my rant for the day.
