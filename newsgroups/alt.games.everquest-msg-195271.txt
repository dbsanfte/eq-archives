I take it from your response that you've always played the game with the
crutch of KEI.  As such, you are fantastically inept at mana management.

I have a shammy ... I've played him since way before the inception on KEI
... I rarely go oom, even in the worst of fights.

It's called knowing your role, and not over-extending yourself.
