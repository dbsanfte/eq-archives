I (maybe wrongly?) concluded it was racist because it was an assumption that
only a certain race would speak a given language. Had he said: "Speaking in
Dutch means only he and fellow Dutch understanding associates can understand
and participate in the discussion" then I would have drawn the same
conclusion as you.

He seemed to me to be directing his ire at the fact that he perceived the
thread to be exlusive to Dutch people, rather than exclusive to "Dutch
understanding people". Maybe I am splitting hairs, but I am very sensitive
to racial intolerance because a habit of cross cultural relationships
exposes me to a great deal of racial intolerance.
