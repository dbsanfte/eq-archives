As a current but soon to be former user of AOL and a former Guide of AOL i
can tell you that AOL is bugged more than you know.  The newer versions of
AOL just make it worse and not better.  I have stuck toggling between
versions 4 and 5 for their greater stability, but its the CAT's lack of
desire to fix security issues that scares me.  Along with respectable
connection speeds, well...unless you change your modem string to display the
correct connection rate, you are fooling yourself to think that littl
enumber that flashes at sign on is your real connection speed.  Try going
her when you log on and check your connection speed
