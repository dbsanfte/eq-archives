From Mike, the original poster:

I'm already back.  I've got to work this addiction out over several 
years, and see every classic Norrath zone.  Perhaps in five years I will 
shed a tear and delete my character.  Strange how RPGs get into the 
heart so much.  I felt guilty about the time wasted that I could of 
spent with my family, but I will try to be moderate in this matter and 
not let EQ consume me.

I played Ultima Online when it first came out, but that did not intrigue 
me.  I then played EQ in its second year, and was fascinated with it 
immediately.  Several times I quit to play other MMORPGs, including DAoC 
and EQ2, but EQ1 is the only MMORPG that has ever captured my interest.

I will stop posting foolish "I quit!" messages.
