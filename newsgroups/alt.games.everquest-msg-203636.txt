I appreciated your work! I enjoy playing with my students online (high
school teacher). I've seen some online more during finals week and gave them
a nudge into reality. It'd be interesting to see the correlation between EQ
and grades (HS and college). BTW, I'm addicted and get my fix daily. I just
live by simple philosophy: When fantasy becomes reality, you cease to live;
when reality becomes your fantasy, you start to live!
