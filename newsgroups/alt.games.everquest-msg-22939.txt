Not in the least.  You have 8 character slots per server.  Jewelcraft
is independant of level.  Make a second enchanter, get -his- skill
up to 250.  I'd level him up to 6th just so an accidental death won't
cause you to lose his stuff if you can't get to him within the very limited
time to decay on the under 6 set, but since you don't need any functional
skills this would take no more than the application of some cash for
bone chips, CB belts or any other choice of buyable exp quest material.

When it comes time to do some -money- work, your main enchanter enchants
the metal before handing it over.  Since you have a 55 chanter to work from,
this won't be till you are making serious plat or velium stuff, after all, whats

a few Kpp in "buy materials, make junk, sell back to vendor" losses?

The "dummy" chanter can put all his points and effort into wis/int, and you
should
have some more than adequate wis/int gear to loan him.

Enchant some plat bars and velium bars and hand them over to him, and
park him somewhere convenient (say Felwithe) to your guildmates who
may want to port/TL in and have something made.  Now -you- can
happily wander around, and anytime jewelcraft is called for all you need
do is find a safe spot to hang.
