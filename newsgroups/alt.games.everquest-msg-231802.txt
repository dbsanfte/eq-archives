Two things.

1.) CIBYS?  (Can I Borrow Your Stuff?)

2.) What kind of swords do you make, and do you have a catalog/price
sheet?  I've been looking for a legitimate (read: not cheap stainless
and glitzy fittings that break if the sword happens to fall off the wall
mount that's just as cheap as the sword) maker/dealer for a bit now, but
nothing is available up here in the NW that I can find.

Oh, and have fun in AZ!  It's a DRY heat!
