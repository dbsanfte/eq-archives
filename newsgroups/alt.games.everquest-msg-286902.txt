Umm... my understanding was that the NON weapon procs were what were 
broken, things like my SK's Shroud of... line buff (proc a lifetap) and 
Touch of the Cursed AA (also proc a lifetap).

If instead they merely fixed the augments on my weapon (hmm, proc a 
lifetap and proc a lifetap, there seems to be a theme!) I'll be pretty 
pissed (due to AA expenditures, the buff and innate procs are MUCH 
bigger than the augment procs)

Or worse yet, maybe they only fixed it so things like my primal lance 
will proc (not a lifetap, Avatar self buff)?  After all, its on a weapon 
while none of my other procs technically are.
