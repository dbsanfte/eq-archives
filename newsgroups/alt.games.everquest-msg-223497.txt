There's one particularly nasty one in in Tak where the dungeon goes
off on 3 paths right from the beginning. All 3 are pretty much of
equal length. Best bet in that type of dungeon is just to clear each
route about halfway before the boss spawns. That way you're at least
haflway there no matter which end he's in and you can usually finish
it pretty quickly.
