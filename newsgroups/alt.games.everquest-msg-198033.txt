 How do you figure Stromm as the most populous server? it's at the
bottom when sorted by population.

my other main server is Karana, which is usually around the bottom at
daytime in the UK and slowly rises as the US kicks in, in the UK's
late evenings.
Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana
Frostfist 35 Beastlord on Stromm
Otserp 32 Mage on Venril Sathir
Wikkan 42 Druid on Karana, Nekk 32 Necromancer, Moorbane 26 Warrior, Zinga 32 Bard, etc....
