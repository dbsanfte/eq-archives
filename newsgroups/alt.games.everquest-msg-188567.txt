The real problem is that the bazaar was a stupid idea to begin with.

First, take all the crowding in the EC twisty tunnel and stick it in a
square room qirhout the twists and turns.

Then, let people park their toons and go to bed.

Lets throw trade skill fixtures (forges, etc) and NPCs in here too, and what
the hell, tack on the horse market too.

Oh, too much for even the most powerful graphics card on earth coupled with
the fastest CPU available, even with a liquid cooling mod on both?

Well, lets limit the number of people now, defeating our original purpose
completely.

Oh, look, the economy is bottoming out! Oh shit, what do we do now?

Hey, lets randomly kick people out of the game if they don't do something
for 5 minutes or more in this zone.

Ok lets throw in a few other random crashes and boots so it's not blatantly
obvious that we have no idea how to properly cope with this mess we've made
simply because we wanted to force everyone that plays EQ to buy our latest
expansion pack.
