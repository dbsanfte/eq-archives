My 38th level main finally completed the J-Boots quest over the
weekend.

I was feeling satisfied so I decided to work on my baking skill some
more.  Being a DE necromancer, I went to Jagged Pine forest via
Blackburrow and bought cheese from the gnoll chef to make some patty
melts.  When I bought the cheese the gnoll chef conned apprehensive.

I went back later to get some more cheese and on the way, I passed too
close to another character who was fighting gnolls and the one he was
working on, took a swing at me.  It never agro'd on me, so I just kept
running.  When I got to the chef, he refused to sell to me.  I
reconned him and I was now doubious.

I assume I took a faction hit when the other character killed the
gnoll he was fighting.  This was new for me, I've never taken a
faction hit for I mob that I haven't done damage to.  Now that I think
about it, I did a drive by buff on the other guy, Spirit Armor I
believe, could this be the reason I got a faction hit?  Is there any
thing I can do to raise my faction with the gnolls in Jagged Pine to
undo this?

I have leveled up killing the druids in West Commons, so trying to
undue the faction hits I've taken with the "good" Jagged Pine
residents doesn't seem pratical at this point.
