400k now.

Based on the setting, reaction to what was seen at E3, Verant/LA are
going to have to really mess up not to have the best thing since sliced
bread.

Also of note, the Korean based mmorpg Lineage has a subscriber base
of 2,000,000 already

Expect it to be very difficult to become a Jedi, the designers (including
Raphe Koster of UO) want that to be an option available to anyone
(so no server quotas) but still be very rare.

Hmm, I've been playing EQ since release, and it's caused no problems
with my relationship with my girlfriend.  Perhaps because I spend less
time playing than the average american does watching tv each week.

I also try to play when she's working and I'm not, and if I'm playing when
we're both home, I usually solo, so I can park my character and go
snuggle and talk to her :)
