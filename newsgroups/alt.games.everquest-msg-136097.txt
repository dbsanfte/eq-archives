That is the dream, anyway.

At the moment, frequent patches, a game still buggy as always after a
major patch, and the very fact that this is so popular its causing
massive crowding in the Bazaar zone, all contribute to a higher
than normal chance for crashes.

Still, an hour a night of selling your wares unattended is a massive
improvement over leaving all the stuff in your bank account, and
to me an even -more- massive improvement over having to
listen to people spamming out their actions once every ten
seconds, and spamming my own out once every five minutes or
so, in EC or in the marginally better auctions channel.

Oddly, I have to shut off ooc and shout and auctions now while
in bazaar... the feature of the new trade stuff I like best is not
having to deal with this, yet the zone seems to be packed with
people who don't get that!
