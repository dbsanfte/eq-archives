No, and it not being easy is probably considered part of the
challenge of the game.  You'll just have to get good enough
to do it even when it's difficult.

As the previous fellow said, a smart tank will help get the
clump of mobs separated a bit, by one means or another (Root
and Stun are good for this).

Also, if you haven't noticed yet, the mob you have targeted
has its name (the one hovering above its head) blinking
(or more accurately, "pulsating" through a small range of
color intensity).  So sometimes that helps to visually tell
precisely which one in the pile you have targeted, or not
targeted.

And if you want to tell exactly which one the tank is
beating on, target HIM (the tank) and then type /assist
(or better yet, have a hotkey assigned to that command).
Your target will now be the same as HIS target.

An even handier technique is to do this in reverse --
target a monster and then type /assist to see who the
MONSTER is beating on at the moment.  In small encounters
this is obvious enough anyway, but on things like dragon
raids, it's not visually obvious which of the 36+ raiders
the dragon is attacking, it really helps to know exactly
who the dragon is trying to swallow at the moment, so you
can fling heals at the poor schmuck.
