I'm really not sure where you're leading.

No one's saying they're identical -- except at the low-level
priest stage.   They're different.  They're just all effective.
Some fit in well better with some groups, others with
others.   (A druid's damage shield comes in damn handy
fighting a 10 mob group;   a shaman's ward works better
against a single big mob that's hitting harder;  cleric's can
fit at the midpoint very well, etc.)   But *any* priest can
take care of a group -- maybe not quite as well to the
min-max players, but enough so a group doesn't have
to disband 1/4 of the way through a dungeon because
they run into a mob the healer can't handle well...
