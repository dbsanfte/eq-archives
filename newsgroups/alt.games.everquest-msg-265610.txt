It is not as simple as that.  Sometimes I'm on the streets with my tanker, 
engaging a pack of villains.  Someone around my own level or lower comes 
running in and starts whaling at them. That's not harassment.  It's not 
killstealing either, to the best of my knowledge. If however a lvl 50 
blaster comes and wipes out the pack (for which he gets no xp or 
influence), that's a problem, particularly if he proceeds to clean the 
entire street so I can't just move on to the next pack.  These two things 
are entirely different. One is a problem, one is not. The idea that I 
"own" the villains is not part of the equation.  The idea that I get or 
don't get XP is.
