It isn't just a matter of setting up web-based email boxes...  But any
reputable business, even a small one, needs to provide contact information,
not just us providing contact information.  Plus, having knowledge to setup
CGI to take information that he will 'contact' them later with
information...  Yes...  He doesn't know how to set up an alternate way to
receive information.  Also...  Something along the lines of 'PAPER TRAIL'.
Given he calls you, not the other way around.  Asking you for CASH, not
check, credit or other means of traceable money funds...  Hmmm...  So
basically, it is 'his word versus yours', as not many people keep track of
cash and who they gave what.

Uhm, yes.  I have.  And yes, it is a hassle.  However, if you are going to
charge the amount this guy is... With a Minimal hour...  Yeah... I'm really
tempted to send $300 or so dollars cash or Cashiers check in mail to a guy
with no real paper trail or way to prosecute him for fraud other than
saying...  'Well, he gave me a PO Box.'  Which, btw, will probably be the
way he will have the money sent to him.  So...  Given the fees he is
charging...  The 'expense and hassle' is worth it.  He wants payment in
front, and no guarentees on it.

> Now imagine a young EQ addict jumping through those hoops...

Don't have to imagine.  A person charging the amount he is offering,
violating several EULA rules, and 'playing' with other player's characters
with a supposided list of 'qualified' people to cover various hours...
Sorry...  It isn't just one EQ addict he is advertising.  No kid can cover
all hours of the day.

Yes, your dog could make a better webpage.  So have other scammers.  So...
You want me to invest money on a cheesy looking website where you say this
is a young dweeb EQ addict offering to sell his time to level my characters
on the times I am not available.  Sorry...  Not going to float.

I think you miss something pointed out earlier, a promise to work your
character at the times you are not able to be on, and suggesting handling
Raids at a premium, only because 'they' hate raids.  This suggests it isn't
a kid, but several people.  Even the unwilling to accept additional
'quality' type people, because they already have enough and don't want other
people.  This is not a few bucks they are making, if they sucker enough
people, you are looking a lot of money here.  Their MINIMUM fee is that of
an hourly fee for Computer Techs at the cheap end and require a minimum of 8
hours.  That is for ONE person.  That isn't going to the other
professionals, since they aren't doing anything.  that is not 'just a few
bucks'.

Sorry, even starry-eyed kids, doing something like this, where it involves
making some LD calls and money, while they might not think that far ahead,
they need help in estimating the value of their time, and the 'fees' they
are asking for is not something a kid would be looking for in playing with
someone's character.

Think this over.  Why do you not do skills?  First thing that comes to mind
is that it is none to fun for us, we rather spend our time getting our XP or
Money in the process.  I don't find Tradeskills much fun because in order to
work them, you need money to do so, and to make money, you need to hunt.  It
is a Catch 22.  They charge you more cause they know for some of us, *gasp*
we rather be doing something else than working up trade skills.  Or have you
coviently forgotten the fact that some of the Velious questions, like the
Ring and Shawl quests for Coldain require you to have decent trade skills in
various things, like smithing, banking, tailoring and jewelcrafting.   As
for raids, another obvious thing there.  Raids are big time sinks.  Trudging
them into areas you want to go into, but don't have the time to put into a
Plane Raid, which I have seen go for 8 hours and not even clear the plane...
Yes, I think it is obvious some players would be tempted by the idea of
having someone raid for them with an opportunity to get one of those nice No
Drop items drops, since they don't have the time to sit there and do it
themselves.  I have been to one plane raid and haven't gone on another
because I simply do not have the time or able to get into one due to time
conflicts.  There are many ways to 'explain' away issues like this, and how
to sweeten the deal to make it too good to be true.

Sometimes, the simplest looking plans are often the most devious.
