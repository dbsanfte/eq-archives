You said it was for a period of 5 years only, which is not the case.

By the way, as I stated the other day and you refused to accept,
the Federal Gov't announced today they would appeal the Ontario
Courts same sex marriage ruling to the Supreme Court.

You have no clue what we face out here. Isn't it hypocritical to
defend the tyranny of the majority when you are part of the majority, 
but rail against it with respect to same sex marriage ?

What rights would be removed from me ? Your hypothetical domino

all be living in Gulags ?

You are truly a piece of work. You make completely false statements
that sexual orientation was added to the Charter under section 15,
I take the time to spell out the genesis of it being added to the Human 
Rights Act, point out it_isn't_ as a matter of fact anywhere to be found in 
the Charter, explain the governments position as to why it isn't and won't 
be included in the Charter, and then you come back suggesting the above.
Why didn't you simply acknowledge you were wrong and clue in that
I happened to know what I was talking about and really don't need your 
silly homework assignment.

It sure wasn't moot when you presented your few examples of where 
same sex marriage would be of financial benefit to the government, 
was it ? I can respond with 30 on the other side of the fence and all 
of a sudden the question is moot ? lol

To make a point which apparently escaped you.

Do you even bother to read responses or do you think the 
raison d'ï¿½tre of this is for you to present a series of soliloquies ?

>Much like most of us will never get veteran's benefits, disability

It has nothing to do with numbers, but everything to do with a
legitimate claim to the benefits in question. What same sex marriage
is doing is to artificially create eligibility by redefining what in fact a 
marriage is. It is akin to a group of people wanting to be declared 
veterans in order to collect veteran benefits even though they weren't
veterans. Realizing this they sue the government for discrimination
and request the definition of veteran be changed to include anyone
who could have or would have served but didn't. You can put a skirt 
on a pig, but it's still a pig.

And your numerous references to benefits reveals what it's really all 
about. In addition to the political agenda, it's all about ' there's more 
in it financially for us if we can be declared married '.


Are you then willing to cut off any
>benefits that apply to a population lower than that percentage?   And

Once again if you had read my previous posts you wouldn't have felt 
the need to ask this. You really should at least scan them before responding. 
There's some good stuff sent your way--you really don't want to miss it.

First of all the federal government _doesn't_ give_any_money to Alberta. 
Alberta, BC, and Ontario are the only provinces which contribute more than 
they receive in return. Secondly, if Alberta contributed in accordance with 
their population [ they don't,they contribute far in excess of their numbers ] 
then no, the federal government should not give money to any province
which isn't also available to every other province. Quebec is the perfect
example of twisted thinking at the expense of the rest of us. They receive
billions of dollars out of proportion to their population or importance.

Other than the fact I hardly have to prove any feelings I might have,
and other than the fact this discussion was an exchange of how we all
' feel ' about the topic, and other than the fact I've acknowledged only
time will tell the positive or negative ramifications of same sex marriages,
and other than the fact there is no way to prove the results prior to the 
event ...........

I find it hard to believe it was all that tough and anymore stressful or
challenging than a myriad of hassles we all faced, albeit different. 
Now I'm not gay, so I can't speak from a first hand perspective, but I 
can speak from one who has had friendly relationships and contact with 
gays for as long as I can remember. Not all positive, as my first encounter 
with a homosexual was when I was 12 yo and a sick homo/pedo tried to
molest me, coincidentally it was also the first time I kicked another guy 
in the nuts.

Can you explain how you face any more of a hassle than anyone else
when it comes to the above ?

>> and don't

Because I don't believe marriage is a ' right ' per se. I believe marriage is 
a privilege somewhat akin to the granting of a drivers license. I also 
believe the inventors of marriage are entitled to define and apply their
definition to whatever criteria they wish. The problem is the state got 
involved, so perhaps the best solution is for the state to get out of the
marriage business, and when they get out, get out all the way. No special
treatment or exemptions for anyone, declared married by some other 
institution or not.
