It's a good analogy, but it frays just a bit.

Here's the rub.  If I go to the course by myself and choose not to go around
by myself, I'll try to grab a threesome and be their fourth.  Now if three
guys show up with matched clubs, coordinated outfits and shoes, and in their
own carts ... they will quite probably take one look at me with my walking
bag and 5 year old shoes and blow me off.

So, in a way, you have to look the part to be accepted into a group
sometimes.

Let's take it a bit further.  Let's say, hypothetically, that once you hit a
certain handicap you become eligible for a really great set of
handicap-restricted clubs.  Only problem is, you can't afford them.  So you
end up having to group with players who have a higher handicap than you do
simply because the folks at your peer level won't hook up with you unless
you have the special handicap-restricted clubs.

Not having the clubs doesn't change your skill level, but it will affect how
much enjoyment you'll get out of your round since you won't be able to get
into a pickup group with people at your own playing skill level.  Even
though the real opponent is actually the course designer and the
greenskeeper.

Change 'golf' to 'EQ', change 'handicap-restricted clubs' to 'Pot9' (or some
other abhorrently expensive spell in the bazaar), and perhaps you can see
what I'm trying to get to.

Agreed.
