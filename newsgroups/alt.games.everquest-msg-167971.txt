I too did a search and the FAQ is something that has been handed down from
individuals for quite some time now.  I have actually been revising the FAQ
since November 2001.

The quote that you refered to, I found that it was first included back in
1998.
You are the first, to my knowledge, to respond it.  If it needs to be
removed then
I will remove it.

In regards to the number of posting that I have is irrelivant, since I have
a login for
each of my characters.  I did a search of three of characters and came up
with
327 postings since April 18, 2000.
