If you read the Analysis and Conclusions section, you get the following 
information on Lineage (and Lineage II):

*****
In previous versions of this report I did not include Lineage: The Blood 
Pledge in my graph.  Why?  Well, two main reasons.  First, it completely 
dwarfed the other MMOGs, distorting the graph and making visual 
comparisons much more difficult.  But more importantly, Lineage uses 
substantially different metrics for �counting� players.  They may have 
close to 4 million �players�, but most of these players did not buy a box 
at the local software store and then pay a monthly subscription fee like 
traditional MMOGs.  Instead, they play in �PC baangs�, Internet 
cybercafes in Korea that buy Lineage access from the company and then 
sell it at hourly rates to customers.  This, combined with the unusual 
Korean dynamic of rapid deployment of broadband and the fact that imports 
of Japanese console platforms were restricted, made Lineage unusually 
popular.  Lineage�s lack of success in the United States via the more 
�traditional� MMOG model only proves this out.  However, people still 
demand to see their data for comparison, and so now that I�ve broken the 
graph into multiple parts, I�ve decided to include Lineage (and Lineage 
II).  The number I will be using is the worldwide total of �Monthly 
Access� players.  This number is the most comparable to a monthly 
subscription in North America or Europe; indeed, at least 50% of Lineage 
players are now on a monthly-subscription as opposed to paying and 
playing in a cybercafe.  NCSoft also tracks a variety of other metrics 
for measuring player population, such as daily access, peak concurrent 
users, registered IPs, and so on.

Reading further (rather than just looking at the graphs), you get the 
following info on Lineage and Lineage II:

*****
Lineage  (Confidence Rating: A)

Lineage: The Blood Pledge has been a gaming phenomenon in South Korea for 
years, and has since been exported, with somewhat lesser success, to 
China, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States.  Some press reports will say 
Lineage has over 4 million �subscribers�.  Lineage actually has a variety 
of different pricing schemes, and many players access the game via 
Internet cybercafes rather than a more traditional monthly subscription.  
The numbers I have chosen to use are the �monthly access� numbers, which 
I feel are the most directly comparable to other monthly subscription 
MMOGs.  As of December 2004, Lineage has just under 2.1 million such 
users worldwide, but only 7,634 in the United States.

Lineage II (Confidence Rating: A)

The sequel to the highly successful Lineage, Lineage II launched first in 
South Korea in November of 2003 and then the United States in April of 
2004.  As of December 2004 they had nearly 2.1 million subscribers 
worldwide, with over 61,835 of those in the US.  http://www.lineage2.com/
