should

you
: think i should switch to the blunts or am i fine with my 11 damage weapon.
: Also where is a good spot I should go for exp. and loot?
:

/boggle  You tank?!?  Get decent Int or HP in your Primary.  Those are what
you need most.  As for loot, HGs are doable, but tough, at 35... Wait til
39.  Go to the forums at http://necro.eqclasses.com (go to the index under
General Discussions) and loo at the where to hunt thread.  It's great info
(hint, Ulthorks in EW drop plat/velium weapons for pet and sale/and tusks or
Druids in WC).
