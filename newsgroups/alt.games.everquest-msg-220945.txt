Yeah, I learned that last night when I asked someone shouting in PoK why
they were making KEI available only to those 45 and over! I was told of an
Extended-KEI...

I dunno. I really think I will try and avoid the crack this time around. I
distinctly remember that when I last played, I felt so dependent on having
KEI that I just wouldn't hunt without it, and would wait around at the Nexus
for an awful long time till I got it. Really spoiled it for me on those
times when I couldn't get it and had to endure normal mana usage. I really
don't like that kind of dependency so I think this time I'm just going to
avoid it altogether.
