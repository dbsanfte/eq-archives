Cleric/mage combo can imbue gems non-stop and
do the same thing.  AND they won't have downtime
if the cleric is level 39 (CHeal) and the mage is level
44 (mod rod.)

The enchanter gets a larger return but has downtime.
The cleric/mage combo has a smaller return but can
do it non-stop and would make more over time.

Or just have the cleric get the focus item and use a
manastone.   Either way, you're effectively talking
about a minute or two downtime between cast cycles
as compared to the 10 minutes or so a level 60
enchanter would have to med back to full even with
KEI.

And there's no need for a high-level cleric:  the imbue
spells are level 29 and work on gems worth 100pp
that are available from vendors.   So even a level 29
cleric can do the trick, if he can get a focus item and
has the initial money needed, and is willing to med.

And *level 8* enchanters could do it as well with the
enchant silver spell anyway, even though that would
be barely worth it, IMO.
