The smithing chisel, to my knowledge, can only be purchased on the moon.
I've got one, but it's on loan from a friend, so I can't say exactly
where it came from.  If you get a large block and put it in the forge
with a chisel, you get ONE small block. If you put the small block in
with the chisel (going from memory) you get two small pieces. Or maybe
the block gives a brick, etc. but you only get one other block/brick
until you get to the smallest one which will yield *two* pieces when
combined in the forge with the chisel. I think they all trivial in the
low fifties. And yes, the info is all at eqtraders if you go look for a
minute or two in the smithing section.
