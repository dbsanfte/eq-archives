I remember reading years ago about a shaman who went to a cave full of iksar
bandits, with lots of food and water, summoned his pet, and went on
holiday... afk for 3 days. He came back to find the relevant factions maxed
and his pet monstrously obese from the mayhem.

I think it won't work unde the new pet rules but i'm not sure. In any case,
the cave now has an underconning nasty in it, and i suspect that was placed
there to stop anyone ever doing this again. He hits hard, drops nothing, and
gives basically zip xp to anyone tough enough to kill him.

Mebbe the shaman's pet was tough enough to deal with him? Pre-POP, was this
possible? I thought shaman pets were pretty weak? Not that I have one yet...
