My corroded plate greaves dropped at the bank, in a four man group
that was there strictly for exp and faction... I'd heard that they changed
the
drop so that stuff drops all over the zone but this was a very pleasant
surprise nonetheless.  We also had silk headpiece drop the same camp,
and a friend fighting in a group at the WL zone line got leather arms.

You see more drops in the arena, this is true.. but you split them among
more people.  Five times as many people killing five times as many
giants, and therefore seeing five times as many drops... but your chance
of actually getting a drop to keep is the same, and you probably didn't
get any exp at all, not to mention that you aren't getting the thurgadin
faction you need to do the quest!  (if your raid group uses points, then
your chance of getting a drop of your own is either much smaller or
much larger, depending on your point standing otherwise....)

Also Cobalt Scar and Sirens Grotto.  The breastplate gems drop only
in SG and VL, or at least extremely rarely in the other zones.
