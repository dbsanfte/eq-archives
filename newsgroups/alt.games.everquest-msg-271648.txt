One thing of interest - in the Subway after you get of the starting
island, a fairly common uncommon drop is called Morphing Memory.
Basically a memory unit that upgrades with you just like the modified
newcomer's armor.  It only fits in NCU slot 1, so you can only get one,
but definitely worth going to get.

I understand your unarmed damage goes up as you level, but I haven't
played my MA past the first few levels.  This was the first profession I
played, so I haven't gone back to revisit it yet. :-)

Fixer is my current pet profession.  They're primary weapons are
MG/SMGs.  The only oddity I've found with this is that the upgraded
solar SMG you get on the starting island can be dual wielded, and I
haven't discovered an SMG since then that can be dual wielded, so
upgrading my weapon is getting difficult.  However, the nanos that
Fixers get help out, since you're looking at damage buffs, HoT's, and
weapon skill buffs.  My Fixer is only 23 or so now, so I haven't picked
up any of the Grid spells which allow access to the grid, or give you
big run speed buffs.
