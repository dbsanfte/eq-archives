I plead guilty.

While trying to make my iksar loved around Norrath, I kill quite a few
beasts.
At first I looted, but now it's not worth the trouble anymore. It does feel
nice though, to walk kneedeep through kobold or gnoll corpses. I'll make
sure you remember me, you landruiners. =)

For me it's just too time-consuming to loot hundreds of corpses.

(and, yes I leave enough beasts of appropriate lvl alive for the normal
dungeon delvers. and when more are there I don't do my mass carnage thing)
