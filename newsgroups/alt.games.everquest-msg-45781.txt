OK, flame away because I did technically deserve it, but I wouldn't have
risked it had the risks been higher.

I brought my alt character to Halas to transfer some items to my main.  I am
giving him a skinning knife, 2 polar bear pelts (to do the quest, for
faction, the armor is about 15 levels too low for me so I just sell it
back), a +2 STR ring (cost me 5pp), a few silk threads, and a few leather
padding (think 5 or so), and 4 LQ bear pelts which I planned on making
leather padding with. All 7 items in a bag.
/camp select
wait 25 seconds and confirm the drop
see bag fall to ground (I'm facing down)
screen freezes for a little while, I think I'm locked up but knowing
rebooting would take longer I don't do anything yet.
I'm not locked up, just being disconnected from the server and returning to
the server select screen.
Reconnect to server
select other player
log back in to find bag gone, either PC, NPC, or time out (more likely time
out my guess, took about 2-3 minutes and I was behind one of the shops in
Halas where there is a tree and I've never seen NPCs wonder, and didn't
think any PCs were around near that part of the zone to see me drop the
items.  Only about 15pp or so total at most, so not too big of deal, plus I
had a spare skinning knife in the bank, but just sucks losing that stuff,
especially the padding, pelts, and ring. Backpack and knife kind of sucked
too, threads were all I'd have not minded so much as I've looted as much as
4 or 5 spider silks multiple times in Everfrost.

By the way, anybody know how hard it is to become kindly to merchants of
Halas faction? I'm amiable right now, and been there for some time so I'd
say I'm probably close.  Other than ice goblin necklace, polar bear skins,
and spider fungus, what is any other good quests?  Polar bear pelts is good
because you can get quality pelts in the process, and also risk the chance
of the rare HQ Bear 30+pp pelt drop as well which that would be fun for a
newbie, loot one or more HQ bear pelts, though the Halas fur trade market is
more like the US stock market back near the end of 1929 to 1930s.

Anybody see the irony of ICE goblins in permaFROST using FIRE as a weapon?
