I remember when I very first tried Test server there was a long
disclaimer (which I imagine most DO NOT read in its entirety),
basically said that NOTHING on Test was permenant and everything was
constantly in flux due to Testing and you could lose ANY or ALL of
your equipment and money and/or character(s)... or something to that
effect.. hehe, been a LONG time, since I don't play on it anymore.

Can't imagine levelling a character there... and some day poof!!
I think that just about the only reason ANYONE would want to put the
time and effort into making a high level character there, is cause
they have that "First on the block" syndrome.
Meaning they like to be 'the first kid on the block with that brand
new toy'
