"Dragon Kill Points". Though that's an old term dating back to Velious 
and before. Now, obviously, not every raid target is going to literally 
be a dragon. But back in the bad old days, the only things worth 
considering "boss mobs" for high end raid purposes were actually dragons.

Systems differ from guild to guild, but in general terms, you'll get 
awarded some points for every raid you go on and participate in. Later 
on, you can "spend" your points when loot drops which you want. You buy 
the loot, use up your points, and keep raiding to build them back up again.
