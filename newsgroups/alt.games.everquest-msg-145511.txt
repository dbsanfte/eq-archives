Hmmm I think I'll wait till the Atari 2600 version comes out Its probably in
the works right now :)

Quote from pocketgamer.org

"Something is amiss on the outskirts of Freeport. More undead then usual are
wandering through the Common Lands. There are rumors of a powerful Necromancer
raising an army of skeletons and zombies to threaten the city. To add to this,
the local orc tribes are taking advantage of the situation and raiding farmers
all along the frontier. The player must confront these evils and save the
populace from the growing menace. 

• Take on the role of a Dwarven Warrior, High Elf Magician, Human Wizard, or
Wood Elf Druid to fight the evil Necromancer. 
• Pocket EverQuest is a single player role playing experience for Pocket
PC’s. 
• Explore a vast game world, complete quests, battle monsters, acquire items,
and increase in level and ability. 
• There will be hundred of weapons, armor, and items for the players to use. 
• Players will be able to travel to familiar EverQuest locations such as
Freeport, Oasis, and Neriak. Dungeons will include such locals as Befallen, the
Spectral Isles, and the Freeport Tunnels. 

There's no information yet on an estimated release date for the title, nor
which devices the game will be compatible with. I'll do my best to find out,
and will of course report back as soon as I know any more.
