Hmmm, as a Kael allied guild we don't play in HoT much, but we do get 
20-30 drops a night.  We have the entire guild in full ToV, except plate 
wearers.  We'll wipe out everything except the plate BPs in the next round 
or two, but all other classes have been full for months.
We've taken to destroying almost all silk, leather, and chain other than 
BPs and legs.  There isn't even much of a MQ sale market for the stuff.

one BP away, but likes the Vindi BP better anyway
