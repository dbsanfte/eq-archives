	I would disagree, at least in EQ's case.  Warts and all, its designers did
a great job of bringing a standard DikuMUD to the mass market.  (EQ's real
problems didn't start until the Kunark era, when its designers started
believing their own PR and fell prey to the next issue.)  As for UO, Koster
won't learn from anything short of divine revelation, and maybe not that
either.  With the possible exception of PvP, he's making all the same moves in
SWG he made in UO: he's treating the game as his own personal copy of SimCity
with the players as the sims.  The problem with that is SimCity isn't fun for
the sims.  (And I have to wonder if the PvP issue in SWG wasn't settled by
higher-ups insisting the game have a switch.  I also wonder if, as I suspect,
everything worthwhile in the game can only be achieved by going PvP.)

	I rather expect that SWG's economy will require a major overhaul before it
will become anything like functional.  The idea that NPCs sell NOTHING and
everything, no matter how basic or necessary, must be made by PCs is
completely brain dead.  Closely related, and just as idiotic, is the idea that
as characters advance in trade skills they lose the ability to make the easier
items.  Koster has this Vision of people setting up cooperative marketplaces
or whatnot, and that's completely out of touch with reality.  No one wants to
roleplay a shopkeeper, not even the people who say they do.

|Key point - it's not those guys anymore.

	That remains to be seen.
