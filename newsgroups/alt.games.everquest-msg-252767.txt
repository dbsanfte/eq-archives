The DKP system we use sounds a lot like what you are describing.

There are roughly 1000 points per member in the guild in circulation.

We use a Vickery Auction to determine the winners and values for loot items.

The total value of the raid is divided among those participating.

Raid value is equal to the total number of points spent on items from the auction.

There are no set values for targets, time spent, or items.

We allow recruits to earn points in the same way as members but their points are not divided out of the raid.  They do
not participate in the auctions until they become members.
