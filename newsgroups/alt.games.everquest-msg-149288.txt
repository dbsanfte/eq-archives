I am.

If I was in charge of the game, and had the power
to say whether there should be pre-made characters
available to players, I would say no. 

Does that surprise you?

That wasn't the question though, the question was
whether I would consider buying such a pre-made
character, and I said, yes, I would consider it.

Do you see the difference?

I can see how you might think your achievements
might be cheapened by people who buy accounts, but
I can't really say that I give a fuck. The same
way I don't care whether someone buys an account
off e-bay or not. If Sony start selling them as
well, tough shit.

Its no use getting shitty with people, who would
be using a legitimate service, offered by the
company that runs this game. 

Save your righteous, misdirected anger, for the
"cancel account" screen, if and when, pre-made
characters ever materialise.

Its shitheads I don't like, challenges are fine.

If EQ starts selling pre-made characters, then
that WILL be the natural progression, won't it?

Its against the rules, and I don't trust you.

Its against the rules. Can you see a pattern here?

I don't WANT to buy my way into these zones, but
if they offer pre-made characters, I might.

 I might come visit you with it as well.
