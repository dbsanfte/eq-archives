Umbral Plains has some nice armor for most classes but it's all no
drop stuff as I recall.  Some nice lore bracers drop off various
named. 

 In PoN and PoI there drop some nice pieces of dropable lore armor
(Leaf Scale Gloves and a helm in PoN; a nice bow, Polished Tin Boots
and Tunic in PoI), but they have recommended levels of 50.  

I'd suggest the alt hunt near the Ry'gorr fort in Eastern Wastes and
pick up the lore ry'gorr armor while getting exp.  Your main could
also try Velk's for crystal chittin pieces and pick up gems for quest
armor later.
