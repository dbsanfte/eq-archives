My guess is a clueless bought account.  Claims to be in his 30's level wise, yet
doesn't know what the arena is, etc.  If he is a troll, he is trying to hide
behind stupidity.  His previous inquiries about how much platinum people have
would lead me to believe he bought an account that included a couple of thousand
platinum, and he wanted to know how he compared to others.
