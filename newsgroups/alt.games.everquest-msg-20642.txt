I don't think it is a waste of time to try and change something that if
enough people asked to be changed it could happen. I have complained to
Verant. And as far as cancelling my account, why? I enjoy the game, I am
just unhappy with a too strict naming policy that is too subjective to
interpretation and the whim of everyone. Either relax the rules or go with a
name generator.
