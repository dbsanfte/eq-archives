I helped a 55 druid get his recently, but I am an enchanter... we were fear
kiting the whole time, with my pet hasted, dual wielding and banging on
it... took about maybe 2 mins to kill tainted, corrupted about 3.
You are a cleric, I see... you have fear line spells, right?
Well if you do, have the druid snare, you fear, druid dot up, and you can DD
every now and then I suppose, but when fear breaks, stun the sucker or he
can pull a heal off before he runs (if you feared while it was casting), so
just stun him and re-fear. That should kill the thing, might take longer
than it did since my pet was hitting pretty hard for a change, and I was
DD'ing every now and then but you probably have more effecient DD's than me.
Good luck =)
