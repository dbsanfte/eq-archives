   I have to admit, I'm something of a bazaar rat.  
 
   Things that I've had no problem selling on FV; Celestial Essences, 4p.  Going
to raise to 5, since I can't keep them in stock at this price.  Prismatic Dyes,
43 plat.  Low population or not, these things sell well.  Grobs Liquidisfied
meat, 5 plat.  And finally, imbued emeralds, 20p.  Sometimes I can't keep these
in stock, sometimes I'll hold on to my entire inventory for two or more weeks. 
Last night, I sold 700 of them.  They are unpredictable, but worth it.
