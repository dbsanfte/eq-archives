I am thinking of creating a Rogue for the purpose of dragging corpses from
dangerous areas. I have heard I only need to get the rogue to level 3 for
hide and sneak.

      Is there any real advantage to trying to level the rogue beyond this
if I will only be using them for this function.
In other words what does incresed skill in sneak and hide give you.
One elf race has hide or sneak as a racial ability is there an avantage to
using this race?

Is there actually any advantage to equiping the rogue.

     In creating the rogue are there any stats which will help the hide and
sneak ability.
