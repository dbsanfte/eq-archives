Hello everyone and I hope someonce can help me.
I wont detail my month long video card dilemma here.  Suffice it to say I am
up and running again using my old card which is a Riva 128zx and Voodoo 2
accelerator.  Atleast the $100 I spent on RAM was worth something.

Anyway my problem is this.  I have turned off all of the new models and have
my clip plane all the way down,  But whenever I am in a city or dungeon I
can barely move at all.  Seems like I am running in slow motion.

I figure my best bet is the newsgroup, because "they" don't seem to care.
More of a atleast you are able to play type of deal.

Anyway any help is greatly appreciated
