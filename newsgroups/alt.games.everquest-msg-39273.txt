I saw a /who bug over an incident like this.

A guy in Qey Hills asked me if I'd hold an item for him so he could give it
to his wife's character.  Aparently he couldn't drop it on the ground, but
he could give it to characters...

I, being a nice guy (and he offered me 50 plat for my efforts), decided to
help him out... though I already knew where this was going to go.  I meet up
with him, and *for some reason* it says he can't give the item to me...

Me: "Hmmm... Let me guess, the 'characters' you could give it to were NPCs."
Him: "The merchant."
/who him = 40 Paladin.
Me: "How do you get to be a 40th level Paladin and not know what 'NO DROP'
means?"
Him: "I don't know."

Funny, I have an idea about it.
