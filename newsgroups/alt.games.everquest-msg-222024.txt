Exactly, and, in particular this was a collection mission, and, we lost 
it.  If we had not taken an extra 10 seconds or so on 70% of the mobs, we 
would have likely succeeded.  Next time someone starts insisting on that, 
I will break the damned mez myself.  A slowed LDoN mob in a normal 
mission is not going to kill an enchanter that fast anyway.  Chances are 
the mob will be attacking me, not the enchanter anyway, as I slowed it 
after it was mezzed, so barring repeated remezzing, I am usually at the 
top of the hate list.
