Well, it's the end of my 18th level wizard twink. He was made for
soloing and it just became unbearable for me without KEI. I never got
into the 'let me read a book while I med' school of EQ and if I have
the time to group, the wizard isn't a character I'm playing. 

I do wonder how it will affect the availability of KEI for the higher
levels. It's not unusual that my shaman is the only one that doesn't
run off to grabt a KEI before heading out to adventure somewhere. Will
enough people still be buying KEI to make it worthwhile for enchanters
to sell it?
