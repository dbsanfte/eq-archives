Taken quite a few spins in Steamfont, gotten one oxide. And the
vendors aren't exactly reliable sources anymore :) Got my second oxide
exping in the Hole. Looked around in Najena, found some elementals but
got annoyed with seeing elementals on track and not being able to
figure out how to get to them. I have a pile of swirling mist and
drops of mercury, though.
