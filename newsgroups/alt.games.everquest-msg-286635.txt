I like this idea, although it will interfere briefly with my other plan, 
which is to be actively casting during the interval before enrage.  Duck 
will interrupt.

I'm pretty used to mobs enraging, this isn't my first mob doing that... 
its just the first time one happened to summon me just as enrage hit and 
put me into a position in his front arc with him in my front arc.  This 
can't be a high probability event...especially considering I wasn't even 
the MT at the time, for it to happen, the MT had to be banished at just 
that magical instant as well.  Within a half second or so I'd have 
turned off attack, and its also important to note that the mez also had 
to land in that same fraction of a second.  The trouble wasn't that I 
got riposted, its that I broke mez because I was swinging.

Yep, got the combine finished today, went thru the POI series of 
conversations to get into Time.  Sort of a letdown, one big ice plain 
with indiff mobs and no exit I could find.  Finally I beat on one till 
my OT hammer procced me out.
