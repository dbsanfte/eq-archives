I am getting, when trying to download the patch, a Local File IO error, file
may be currently in use... nope, not running EQ, it isn't set to read only,
etc.. anyone?  gonna post this as a message by itself as well, so more
people see it, I hope.

ps- also got the famous EQfx_Dx8.DLL error when I tried to bypass the patch
using eqw.  was trying to get into the tech chat room =0(.. man their phone
lines are packed.  I feel for them.

anyways, anyone else get the local file IO error or know what to do about
it, let me know (and I'm on a dial up, so it takes about 3 hours to patch
and decides to give me the error about half way through.. I have done it
three times).
