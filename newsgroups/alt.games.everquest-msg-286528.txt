Nonsense.  Automated test suites are for automating as much as
possible of the testing.  The last thing you want to do is only test
weird conditions... you want to test normal cases, error conditions,
etc etc etc.  Basically you want to catch as many errors as early as
is possible.

Obviously if there's no automated testing, they can't introduce tests
for everything.  But what they can do is introduce testing *as they
introduce changes*.  So when you change how AAs work, you introduce
tests that verify that the old AAs and the new AAs work the same.
