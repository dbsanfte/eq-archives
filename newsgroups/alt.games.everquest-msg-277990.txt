It would? Suing a company that's been abusing their IP for years and
also known to facilitate scamming of their customers would
"demonstrate their rank hypocrisy and outright greed"? Suing a
competitor using THIER IP WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION to run a MULTI
MILLION DOLLAR BUISNESS? Fine, I guess you'd have no objection if you
owned a store to me setting up a stall out front to conduct sales of
my own (Selling the same product as you) without asking you... After
all, it would "starkly demonstrate their rank hypocrisy and outright
greed" to all your customers if you took legal action against me for
doing what you're doing.
