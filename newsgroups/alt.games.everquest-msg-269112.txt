No. Rather obviously wrong actually. What article?

The tick is a client side artifact. The server tracks things like mana
and hp in realtime. This means the tick has no gameplay affect at all,
its in there to reduce pressure on the client CPU. Though you still
run into some people who still think sitting to med just before the
tick then standing up then sitting before the next tick works.
