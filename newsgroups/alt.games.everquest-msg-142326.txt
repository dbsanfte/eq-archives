No.  I was criticizing you for "gratuitous" insults (i.e. insults tossed
offhandedly into a discussion that up to that point was fairly civil).
The insulting tone I adopted above was a deliberate response to your
gratuitous insult, along with your repetition of that <very> inaccurate
summarization of my position which seemed at the time to be a
deliberate choice (but see below).

I apologize for implying that your apparent incomprehension was a
deliberate illusion, it is now clear that you really are failing
to understand the difference between:
"There is a valid way of viewing the relationships between classes
in which paladins are closer than druids/shamans to clerics."
AND
"Paladins are closer than druids/shamans to clerics."

What I'm having trouble with is the stubbornness with which you hold
that your rather narrow-minded point of view is uniquely valid.  I am
simply amazed that you are so utterly unable to grasp what I have said
that you insist on misstating my postion repeatedly (three times now).
