    Ok, so I have a good guild that constantly has something or other going
on... sometimes it's even just something fun, but mostly it's the same old
xp grind with a few friends or solo.
    Ok, so I have a shaman that I got from 47 to 52 in 4 days by solo
camping a few spots for 16 hours each of those 4 days.
    Now what?
    Alts suck (28 Warrior, 22 Cleric, 13 Chanter, 12 Wizard, 11 Ranger, 11
Bard, 7 Rogue) and I spent way too much plat on them to even mention. All of
which was before the bazaar sent prices through the freaking floor, so now I
REALLY feel stupid.
    I have done the whole obsession thing, lemme see... Camped Quillmane for
4 months until I finally got a cloak with no whining mages in the zone...
Did AC in sro until I MQ outfitted all my friends with jboots, that took
about 2 weeks.... Spent 2 days in the grey to get a perm eb neck item, that
was fun... Spent 5 days or so working smithing (that's right, did nothing
but smith for 4 to 6 hours a day in EQ), and luckily it was before the patch
nerf... Have killed the Mino Hero and turned in the shackles for bracers
about a half million times, again to outfit alts and friends *sidenote: I am
so KoS in freeport I don't dare get anywhere near it even invised. Sgt.
Slate thinks I'm his whore*... I have camped enough plat to get my shaman
his JBB and a fungi, but I always spend it on alts before I see them for
sale... I finished as much of my epic as I could with a small group of
friends or soloing (all that remains are the book/page drops in CoM, then
the Hole and PoF... yes, that's right, I had my epic SoW boots at level 35
*sigh* and believe me, I got constant questions about that the first time I
went to PoH and turned down a boot drop at level 46) and I spent 8 months on
Legends just to find out I was totally screwing myself being there.
    Ok, enough rambling, the problem is this: What now? I haven't been in
the 50 plus game on EQ ever before and even with a great guild that's
constantly on the move, with or without me I find I am at a loss. I
basically solo'd my way all the way to 52 from the first time I walked down
the Halas ramp and promptly got gang-banged in the newb highway. I have had
friends along for the ride more than once, to duo or just chat with, but
most of them are gone or never on anymore.
    I aint burnt out, that I know, just bored really and with no clue what
to do next. I am strongly considering gathering all the twinkage together
for a yard sale and trying to get either the fungi or my jbb, since the
bazaar has ruined my chances at selling for enough to get both, but I am
worried about settling after a short jaunt in that hateful zone just so that
I can get the hell out of it.
    EQ2 is really taking too long, IMHO. At least with that it could let me
start over right along with everyone else, and maybe even not have to worry
about the high end game for another 2 years...
    Do tell: what am I missing here? What now?
TIA...
