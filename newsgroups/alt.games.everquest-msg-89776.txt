The *classic* essay on this matter is:
   http://tweety.bowlofmice.com/tweety/try_being_a_guide.html

Full essay title:  "Try Being A Guide, You Nutless Assmuncher".

"Tweety" was an EQ guide for a while, and after putting
up with a lot of crap from the low-IQ end of the player
pool, wrote this hilarious essay to describe what it's 
often like on the other side of the fence.

She was subsequently booted from the Guide program,
not for calling a subset of the players morons, but
for, basically "revealing Guide secrets", like the
fact that they can't rez you just because your ISP
booted you.  Yes, really.

Then for good measure they banned her player account.

There are a couple of dozen other top-of-the-line
EQ rants and essays written by her at the same
website.
