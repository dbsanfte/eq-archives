PoK eliminated as much world effects as it could, including faction,
travel, exoticness, regional variation, etc etc. It was a complete
surrender to the "to be playing EQ you must be actively grinding exp
or raiding at all times" mindset.

An action game is about action. EQ would be a very very shitty action
game if that is what it wants to be. A rpg game is about choices,
among other things. PoK made many many choices completely irrelevent,
in favor of shifting focus onto the aforementioned action (grinding).
