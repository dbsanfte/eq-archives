Ok posting this question here as tech support is crap in UK and US tech
suport is closed.
Ok so my account expired but now when i go to the global collect site on the
station there is no subscribe button. aggghhh why am i not able to subscribe
also the other problem is that my bank didn't do the transfer they were
meant to so my account wasn't up to date money wise until yesterday when i
found out. today my account expired, i have already sent them the money up
to date and for another month (I think)
but i still cant get in.
Can someone explain WTF is going on
or is/has anyone been in the same boat?
