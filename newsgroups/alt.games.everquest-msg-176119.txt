Shooting Shark
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - D. Roeser - P. Smith - )

Well I'm up there beside the magic man
And he layed some tricks for me
He said you do need help my friend
I whispered, obviously

He laid a spread of Jacks and Queens
And he begged me take my pick
But every face that had your face
I cried out, I am sick

Chorus: Sick of hauling your love around
Want to run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone
Oh it's a hard love to love you it takes up all my time
Having you so familiar like past lives and nursery rhymes

So I gave away the pictures and your golden ring
And the phone calls you sent me and the silver birds that sing
Then the man he told me something that really brought me down
Your things were blown away it's true but you were still in town
Chorus:
The magician left a message, it flashes when I hide
Accept the chains of loving,
Accept the rails remove yourself from her side
Do without her love

As I lay back in the speeding train, I keep it by my side
I could mail a letter to you but I still have my pride

Chorus

Three times I've sent you back from me three times my boat's gone dry
And three times I've seen the shooting shark lighting up the sky
Oh it's a hard love to love you babe it takes my breath away
The fourth time round is the last time round there's nothing else to say
