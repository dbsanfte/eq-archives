Iksar really has better stats and equipment as a shaman over a troll
from the get go. It has max of 115 wis (highest of all shaman races in
game now) and great other shaman stats (since no other ones really
matter unless your agil is too low) A shaman does not melee anyway
beyond the low levels and the priest melee table generally sucks.
Yeah, an iksar does not have the benefit of going to the evil cities
in the old area but why would it? Its own city area in kunark emptying
out into several great zones is the best of all. 

That being said a troll is pretty good as long as you max wisdom. You
will have something like 25 lower wis off the bat I think. Trolls are
funny and fat and moderately few of them are around at the high levels
so if you stick with it you can be quite the fun character. The only
real questionable shaman might be the ogre and it only is if you don't
remember to make agil at least 75 or more.

They have the same regen rate.

Iksar has VERY easy class armor quests which are BETTER gear than the
old world shaman armor. This is a comparison example:

Iksar:  once you get sow at level 9, if you have the money for the gem
you will need for the quest, run to the overthere zone, skirt along
the right side of the zone and hang out a bit away from the city where
you can still see the evil dock along shore (out of aggro range) Oh,
and bring some bat wings and fish scales you can buy on newbie vendors
outside of your home. 

Swim out on to the evil boat, giving the evil area itself a wide
berth, so you come from behind the boat sort of. Once on the boat any
skell guy or anything wont jump you from the dock thing. 

Take boat to timorous. Hopefully someone is there kill watchmen (they
were when I tried this) ask to loot glasses. If its a druid ( was
lucky and it was) hand him the fish scales and bat wings which he will
probably be happy to get, in exchange for a levitate and enduring
breath (or wait to do this until you are high enough to yourself,
which is really easier) Run down to the hidden inn and buy the no drop
drink. Gate back to halas and buy the gem you need and get your iksar
shaman bp which is better than totemic.

The old world way involves killing lots of stuff in south karana in
the hopes that griz the treant spawns and you can bag him (level 30 or
so?) then getting  a lancer sword fish fin form outside kedge (about
as high)

Most of the other quest armor is similar. I managed to get all but the
iksar quest helm and arms on my own (those are a bit harder), just
asking players in an area like dalnir or the overthere to please say
if a no drop item dropped while I hung out in the zone. My main is a
goody with bad iskar faction but luckily a dark elf sk who had done
much faction work with the iksar could go with my main into kurns and
get the helm drop then quest for it and give it to my iksar.
