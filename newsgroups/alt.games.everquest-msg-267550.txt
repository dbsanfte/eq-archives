The loot window opens for all when anyone opens it.  It contains buttons for
"Accept" and "Decline" (and something else I don't recall), and a timer that
says "this item will be lotto'ed in N seconds" or something like that.

You click accept if you want it, decline if you don't.  At the end of the N
seconds, or when everyone has accepted or declined, the server rolls and
awards the item.  I don't know if people who neither accept nor decline are
in the lotto or not.
