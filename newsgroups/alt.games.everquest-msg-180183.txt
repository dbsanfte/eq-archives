I finally made it to 32 and so far I've been in groups.  Am I old enough now
to start swarm kiting?  If so, can someone tell me which songs are involved
and how it's done?  I plan on practicing in nearby Misty Thicket once I
figure out the technique.  I played around a little bit with charming in
Highkeep so I think I have a general grasp of how that one works.  The
fear-kiting doesn't sound as appealing, because you end up running all over
the place and don't much control over what area you're running through.

Thanks!
