Heh. I remember a joke from one of the Discworld books (Terry Pratchett?) about
Dwarven Journey Bread. "If you have some Dwarven journey bread, you always have
something to eat." Yeah, because anyone other than a dwarf would rather eat dirt
or chew on half-decayed wood or nibble granite or chow down on your own mother
than eat dwarf journey bread, it was that bad. "Hmm.... eat the bread or this
rotting corpse dragged out of the river... So, who want's a drumstick?"

I *shudder* to think of what dwarven battle bread would be like.
