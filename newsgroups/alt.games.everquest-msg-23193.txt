This is what I found at URL:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/general/common_everquest_error_cod
es.jsp

(translation into easier to understand English below this next paragraph)
This error will only occur when you are unable to connect to the login
server. You may receive this error when the EverQuest servers are brought
down for their routine maintenance, and you try to log into EverQuest while
they are down. Please remember that any type of firewall may prevent you
from logging into EverQuest if you are blocking certain ports. Please visit
our Firewall and Proxy Information page for more information regarding the
port number for the login server. If you are having continual troubles, and
are repeatedly receiving this error even when the EverQuest server are up
then you may want to visit our Network/Connection support page for
additional connection troubleshooting.
---
What it means is either the servers are down (they were not) or perhaps you
are using a firewall and it does not have the correct ports open.  If
neither is correct, go to their Network/Connection support page for more
help.

If you are using a firewall or proxy server, they have a page for that too.
