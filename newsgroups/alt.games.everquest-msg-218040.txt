True, but blind rote repitition of the same object over and over again, 
will eventually get you very consistent success with that object, even 
if you lack any skill at all. You will eventually get good at making 
that one exact thing.

After stuffing 10,000 envelopes your skill at origami will not be going 
up, but you will be able to stuff that particular envelope with a 
particular set of contents very efficiently, with very few screwups.
