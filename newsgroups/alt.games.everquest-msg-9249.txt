1. Kill will-o-wisps. Sell the Lightstones for merchants for about 1pp. Turn
in the greater lightstones into one of the gypsies in NK and get a tomb or
something. You sell that back to her for 6-9pp. Plus get some good xp for
your level.

2. Kill bears. HQ pelts sell for 15-30pp. LQ and MQ for around 1-2+ pp.

3. Kill wolves and cats. LQ, MQ, HQ pelts sell for around 1-2+ pp.

4. Kill bandits and turn in their sashes to someone in Qeynos. 

5. Kill large or giant spiders. Combine two spider silks in a sewing kit
(never fails reguardless of tailoring skill) to form a stackable swatch. The
swatches sell for 1 pp each usually.
