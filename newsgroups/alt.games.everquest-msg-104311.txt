You know I *DO* think Everquest needs a warning label.

And, after spending around 400pp to get my skill from 163 to 177 in
fletching, I think that warning label should read:

WARNING: Attempting to attain Grandmaster level in any of the
tradeskills in Everquest will result in Carpal-Fucking-Tunnel
syndrome.  Goddamnit.

Might have to be worded a bit differently than that, but there you go.
