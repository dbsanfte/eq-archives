>>> What is this quest? <<<

There is a Realm of Heroes NPC for every race. I've seen each one, except
for the Vah Shir one (could be because I haven't looked for him/her).

IIRC, it's part of a GM quest. If a GM is feeling particularly nice, he can
give you a coin. You give that coin to any Realm of Hero NPC, and they give
you some item.

But since GMs are pretty stingy (when they ever do show up), very few people
know about the quest or the reward.
