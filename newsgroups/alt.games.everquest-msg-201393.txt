My druid is 53, my wizard 52.  Neither here nor there except as background.

If you're bound in POK you don't need many of the self ports.  If you only
hunt with people who have POP, you don't need many of the group ports if
THEY are bound in POK as well.  You WILL end up needing all the ports at
some point but if you're hurting for money (and you say you are), this is
what I would do:

Bind in POK.
Steamfont, Tox, Feeroott, Misty are covered pretty well.
Buy Lavastorm, Karana (both NK & EK) and Commons (both self & group, none
are covered THAT well with POP).
Buy Stonebrunt obviously, both self & group.  In fact, hang out in POK and
you can probably make some cash porting folks to SB (and Commons, and
Lavastorm, and NK) so you can buy your others.

Iceclad can wait.  Cobalt Scar and Wakening Lands buy when you hit those
levels (or within a couple levels after).
Great Divide is covered VERY well unless you're going to Velks (keep that in
mind when you're thinking of hunting there).
