> What is the command to remove your surname ?

I have always appreciated the hell that GMs and guides have to put up with.
The vocal majority of people in game and on this newsgroup seem to love to
harass them, call them names, etc.  All my dealings with them are 100%
polite.

And yet, a couple of times they told me "no" even though I know that the
answer could have been "yes" if they wished.  One of the "nos" is when I
asked for them to delete my surname because I didn't like it.  This was
shortly after Verant changed the rules to supposedly allow them more
flexibility regarding stuff like this.

Oh well.   Well, I decided to ask again a month later but this time I lied.
Here's my petition:

/petition Hi!  Could I get you to delete my surname, please?  I got a
divorce and she took half of everything I own...in fact, I used to be a
human!
(I play a gnome)

My petition was never answered in /tell after 4 hours, and I thought "oh
well, I'll try again later."  The next day I logged him on and noticed the
surname was gone.  Cool. :)

Politeness, humor, and respect (via not abbreviating easy-to-type words like
"please" and "you") are extremely powerful tools.
