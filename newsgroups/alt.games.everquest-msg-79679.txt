Sure let give Rangers the ability to stand back like caster and shoot arrows
first take away their AC and Hit points so they will be like a caster then
we have to increase the the rate a hit will raise them on the hate list.
Lets see Casters have a limited supply of mana so we will have to raise the
cost of arrows to say 1p ea. to limit the number of arrows a Ranger will use
or allow them to only have the ammo slot for arrows so when the 20 are gone
they have to sit done and make more.
