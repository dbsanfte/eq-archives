Kinda funny, then, that all the (extremely outdated) advice on boards for
paladins said to get a mithral two-hander as fast as possible, since it was
the best weapon in the game.  Verant must have been dying at the fact that a
nerf was considered a selling point.  Of course, it's possible that even
with the nerf (assume all FBSS were going to warriors, monks, and rangers...
wasn't it before rogues were boosted?), the M2H was still a better option
than whatever you walked into UGuk with (what, a combine greatsword?).
