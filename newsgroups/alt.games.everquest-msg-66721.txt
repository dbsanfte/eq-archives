You don't see many paladins or rangers with all thier points into Wis,
and you don't see many bards or shadowknights with all their points
into Int.

Beastlord is not a caster class, nor a healer class, its a hybrid class.  While
Wis does determine the mana pool size, it doesn't determine the regen
rate of mana, so more wis doesn't mean more kills per hour, at most it
means larger kill at one time.  This is also true of all casting classes, but
hybrids have another means of killing; melee.  Stats that improve melee
damage and damage resistance mean more actual kills per hour... higher
damage means mobs die faster, higher damage resistance means you take
less damage during fights so you need less healing time between, or to spend
less mana on healing between fights.

You can't improve your mana regen time but you can improve your melee
efficiency, so that should be your main thrust in a hybrid.

Melee stats are strength, agility, stamina, and dex.

Stamina means more HP...and thats just like wisdom, increases the size of the
pool but doesn't mean you can take more HP damage per hour, with more sta you
can survive larger battles but you can't kill more mobs per hour because your
regeneration or mana to heal cost remains stable (until clerics start
CHealing... but I don't think beastlords are ever going to be main tanks on boss
mobs)

Strength is a classic melee stat; with a higher strength you do more damage per
hit.  Pretty straightforward, except that the effect isn't all that pronounced
and isn't likely to make all that big a difference in your damage over time
equation.  It also allows you to carry more weight, but while the monk equation
doesn't seem to be in play, Beastlords are still a leather class, and aren't
likely to get very deep into trouble with weight carried unless they insist on
being the ML...

Dexterity helps learn, perhaps, but primarily fires the production of procs.  If
we can find a lot of interesting proccing weapons then this might be a good
stat, but since we don't seem to recieve double attack, we'll never be the Proc
Gods that rangers are.

Whats left?  Agility.  Agility affects armor class. AC affects how much you get
hit, and for how much.  If you take less damage, then you don't need to spend so
much time on your butt, or bandaging, or so much mana on heals.  The operating
question is, can we get AC up high enough with leather and agility to
meaningfully cut damage?  The degree to which agility matters seems to vary by
class, if beastlords are on the monk schedule, then the answer seems to be yes.
If not, then it doesn't really matter much where we put the stats... charisma
perhaps to let us buy kitty treats cheaper.

Personally, I put enough in to bring both agility and stamina to 100... and I'm
sorry I did the stamina, in retrospect, 100  is an important target, but
beastmaster weapons seem to be very light, so stamina won't be that big a deal
unless underwater, and enough points to take sta up to 100 at that point is not
hard to come by.
