I watched a couple episodes when it came out, struck me as a weak
attempt to ride the ST:TNG spinoff DS9 concept into commercial
success (not that DS9 was all that and a bag of chips either).

Bored and mildly disgruntled, I didn't bother watching it
serially after that, I saw a few episodes, and came to the
conclusion that it was one of those shows where you really had to
stick with it to enjoy it, and since I only occaisionally had
time to catch any episodes at all, I'd never catch up.

I suppose I -could- now get the whole thing on DVD and watch on
my schedule instead of that of the network... but in the back of
my mind is still the general dislike of the thing from what, 10+
years ago when I first saw it?
