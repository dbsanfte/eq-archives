who is this "they"...sorry KinSlayer, i too have since the one scren shot of
FV with the cape...and according to what i've been told before, there's been
code for capes/cloaks in EQ ever since beta, it was just removed for lag and
frame-rate considerations.  so while it's quite possible you'll see more
capes on NPCs in Luclin, we still may not be able to see those white wolf
hide cloaks we've been collecting.  anyone with anything more definite than
"they says this will be an option you can have off or on in Luclin."
;)
