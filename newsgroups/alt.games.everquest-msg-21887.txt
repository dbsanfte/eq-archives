When I was living Kurn's full time collecting massive amounts of
bone chips for Cabilis faction, I constantly camped the Jester area,
and finally got the Club near the end of my stay, after a full
week and a half, on the fifth (or maybe it was the sixth) Jester
that I saw (all the prior ones had carried Fine Steel swords).

Contrary to most of the Kurn's maps, he does NOT spawn in the room
with the hole in the floor.  He spawns anywhere along the hall that
runs outside that room, in a "U" shape, starting at the "T" where
most people enter the stable area (as it splits left to the Cook
area, and right to the six-room hall that then turns left into the
hall that runs outside of the "hole" room), and then continues
all around to the big split-level room full of Burynai and skeletons.
There are two spawns in that "U", which can (rarely) be the Jester.

It also seems that the jester will not spawn unless there's
no other "named" in the stables area (e.g. Thickboned,
Cook, etc.), so keep them all cleared.
