Actually, the majority of the arguments for not disabling inspections
are basicly "it ain't broke, don't fix it"...there's no compelling
reason to fix it, so why bother? That's self-serving? 

What the big debate here is truly is people getting worked up into
hissy fits over being inspected without being asked. There's no real
reason to put much that much time and energy and emotion into
something so trivial. There's no harm done. *shrug* Yeah, I apologize
if I accidentally inspect someone, I ask before inspecting
intentionally, but I see no reason for all the rage from some people
over those who don't do these things.
