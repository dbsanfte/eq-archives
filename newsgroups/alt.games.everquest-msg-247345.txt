Thank you.  It was when I was taking a look at Bruce Woodcock's research
that it struck me how closely the EQ curve resembled a growth curve.

I'd add into that the fact that both established and more recent players
seem to be becoming less tolerant of raiding for hours on end to achieve a
goal.  There will always be those who look at things like that as a badge of
honor, sure, but by and large it seems like then days of "We're spending the
weekend in Hate" are dwindling.

Changes to the game like HP regen and BW to 70% are evidence of that as
well.  More uptime is good ... it's one of the reasons I play AO primarily
with EQ as second fiddle.  But I'm saying this type of change illustrates
your point.

I thought that PlanetSide would cut into DAoC's PvP base, but it really
hasn't.  Possibly because it's an SOE product, and DAoC players seem to hold
SOE in as much regard as Linux people hold Microsoft ... I don't know.

If you look at the chart in Woodcock's research as an analogy to a growth
curve, then the 'Decline and Death' phase actually started about July of
2003.
