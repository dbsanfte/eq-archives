I'm surprised to see such a thoughtless response from you Dennis.
Still, it comes as no surprise to see that the overtly religious
have no monopoly on closed-mindedness or blind faith.  Or can you
not see that your certainty in making that statement is itself an
act of blind (i.e. unexamined) faith?  What I'm telling you, if
you care to listen, is that just as surely as the unexamined life
is not worth living, the unexamined faith is not worth believing.
