	You are answering the wrong question.

	No one is denying that RL tactics are effective, or that people who ignore
them are going to get splattered.  The point is that a) these tactics are
intended to produce one-sided confrontations, b) one-sided confrontations are
not interesting by their very nature, c) the primary purpose of a game is to
entertain, d) uninteresting situations are not entertaining, thus e) games
that reward RL tactics are poorly designed.

	Thus my statement that PvP in muds is an idea whose time has gone.
Competitive games need to be tightly regulated to produce enjoyable
competition; this is why professional sports have rules and referees, and
things like salary caps and weight classes.  The kind of open competition
found in PvP muds serves only to empower those who care for nothing but
victory, making virtues like honor and sportsmanship into liabilities.  This
point tends to be lost on a lot of my countrymen as the days of laissez-faire
capitalism have passed out of living memory.

	I am an old-school wargamer; old enough to own SPI games in the flat
plastic boxes.  The Sun-Tzu is one of the seven books I keep within arm's
reach (the others are the Lao-Tzu, the Chuang-Tzu, the analects of Confucius,
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Machiavelli's _The Prince_ and Chandler's _The
Simple Art of Murder_.  I see my copy of Machiavelli has gone AWOL though;
I'll have to replace it.)  I certainly don't need to be lectured on what
effective tactics are, and if you think I'm in favor of eschewing them in
favor of warm-and-fuzzy moves I suggest a Google search on my name in
rec.games.trading-cards.misc in conjunction with a game called Shadowfist.  I
am merely pointing out that rewarding these tactics, in terms of victory
conditions, produces an unenjoyable game.
