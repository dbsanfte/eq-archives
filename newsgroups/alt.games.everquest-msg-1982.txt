If you've started off in Qeynos, then the tax collector quest is quite good
for learning your way around the city. He gives you a box, and asks you to
go to various shops and collect some taxes from them. If you don't want to
do the quest, you can keep the box that he gives you - it's very useful for
storing stuff in for the first few levels. Just don't hit combine!
Someone should be able to show you the way to the tax collector, if you ask
nicely :)
