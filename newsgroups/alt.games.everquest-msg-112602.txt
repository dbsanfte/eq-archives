Here's a thought on the 4-in-1 drivers.  Uninstall them.  Then
consider trying them 1 at a time or not at all.  Or go about 5 revs
back even.  
I just put together a machine around the Soyo 266 dragon board and the
4-in-1 drivers just totally stuffed it all up.  Ended up with ONLY the
ide drivers installed, didn't use the rest.

There's a forum over at www.viahardware.com you might try.  Sometimes
you can get a usefull answer there.  Sometimes not...
Depends on who's reading.
