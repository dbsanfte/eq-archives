Cute way of avoiding the issue.  You could at least have been gracious
enough to acknowledge my honesty.

It was quite clear that you did not know same-sex couples had
common-law status as of Jan. 1, 2001 in Canada.

I'm not "getting my way".  In case you forgot my stance on marriage,
here it is, quoted directly from a previous post:

    There are already so few
    differences between marriage and common-law status in Canada, lets
    scrap the remaining differences.  Organized religions could
continue
    to have whatever ceremonies they wish, but from the government's
point
    of view you would either be "single" or "in a relationship", with
no
    distinction between what is now called common-law and marriage.
Once
    all the kinks got worked out the end result would probably be much
    simpler and easier to work with.

That was in reponse to Gabby on July 29.  In other words if I was
"getting my way" marriage would be scrapped entirely as a legal
entity.  I would also remove some of the government's ability to
define relationships and put that back in the hands of individuals.

The judges no more usurped the role of the legislature than the
reverse.  At least in recent history both have acted according to the
powers granted them by the Constitution, others laws, and precedent.
Just because you feel some decisions go against your views of courts
vs. legislature does not make the judges guilty of anything.

As judges retire they are replaced, true.  Since they serve much
longer terms, on average, than any elected government, they represent
a broader base of political backgrounds than the party in power at the
time.  This is considered one of the important balances in our system
of government.
