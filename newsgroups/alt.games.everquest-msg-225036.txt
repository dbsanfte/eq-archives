Well, you have to put 6 in general before anything else.  See another
thread that Bob started regarding that.  The upshot is that you might
as well get Run 3 and 3 points in just about anything else, they aren't
a big deal.

DS's don't generate aggro (unless you cast it on a player who is already
engaged with a mob - but it's just a buff in terms of aggro)

Rangers don't have to taunt if they are careless with their spells - 
snare and a dot and any procs and boom, they will be on top.  It's really
up to the ranger to duck aggro.
