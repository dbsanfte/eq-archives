I figured it out.  The bits were different between windows and everquest.
Set them both to 16 and it worked right away.  Seems to run at a fairly
decent speed in the window too (i.e. not notable slower).  Unfortunately the
slow 'Now loading...' parts tie up the whole computer (there appears to be
excessive memory usage during these parts, as I've mentioned elsewhere in
this thread I'm going to upgrade my memory, yeah yeah, I know).

I'm admittedly still surprised at the resourses required for running a
'silly game'.  By the time I've configured my computer to be ready for
Everquest 2 it will be more powerful than the high-end graphics workstations
that we use at work for broadcast 3d graphics.
