Now Ben the man asked for facts and you give leasons in subjectivity.

Char creation is different and there is a great latitude in how you
player progresses to higher levels. In EQ a 40 enchanter is a 40
enchanter no real difference in skills or abilites assuming both are
good players. Not so in DAOC they can be very different from each
other depending on how they play the game. Some like that others dont.
Grind is there but its no worse than EQ (mindnumbing is the bottom
rung you can go no lower ) the RvR (team PvP) does change things in
the high end game. And last but not least...they have real customer
service in DAOC, not the best mind you but you can talk to someone
pretty quickly should a problem arise. Need more play the game and see
for yourself. Otherwise they show many of the same problems eq does
just in a different way that perhaps you may find easier to accept, or
not.
And btw Soloing is not treated as a red headed step child  but a valid
type of play.
