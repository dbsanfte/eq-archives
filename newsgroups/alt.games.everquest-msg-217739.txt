I heard about it, and it happened to me! I trivial for leather
padding, and I was turning some pelts and spiderling silk into gold.
:-)

Every combine, first thread and pelt then two silks to thread failed.
I did maybe 6 or 8 combined and failed every one. At 5% each, the odds
are slim this is random chance.

Anyone else seen this bug?
