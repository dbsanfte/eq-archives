I've done it that way.  Slow and sloppy, but you can't expect peak performance from
everyone.

If there are only a few bodies, its no big deal.  If you don't want to go fast, its no
big deal.

On the other hand, if someone approaches me with a method for going faster, I don't
ignore it.  I might question it.  I might conclude its not worth my time, after some
thought.  But I don't write it off just because its not the way things have always
been done in the past.

I'm sure if I sent any random cleric a tell like that, it would be ignored.  After
all, most clerics haven't thought of this idea.  But try it and you might find you
like it.  Spending a few seconds explaining the idea to shave a few seconds off every
single rez for the rest of your mutual life seems worthwhile to me.

On Morel Thule, quite a few people now send me tells "can you click my target?" when I
show up in graveyards.  And the idea wasn't originally mine, I've just adopted it and
explained it to lots of clients, and adapted it to raid use.

Why would clerics be getting tons of tells?  I typically get about four tells per
total wipe that aren't rez related.  A couple BOR a couple Virtue, thats it.

I admit we aren't highest end by any means, AOW, Grummus and Arch Lich are our latest
successes, we haven't got past BOT level in POP.  But that doesn't mean I haven't
rezed 50 people in short order while avoiding repops in situations where moving five
feet out of line would wipe us again... heck anyone who's gone to Hate in their low
50s has been in that kind of situation!
