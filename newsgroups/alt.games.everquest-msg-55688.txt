My level 13 warrior had trouble finding anything to kill in WC last
night until someone ended the event. I switched to my level 8 mage,
went to north ro (damn that pet rocks, especially when he is yellow)
and got some exp/pet-hunting-practice until the event there restarted
and killed my pet. I stuck around the EFp zone for a short while,
killed some very green event mobs with melee and the occasional nuke,
and got the 3 int 5 mana caster ring from something that probably was
level 3. That area of the zone was far from overcamped, and now I want
to shoot for the robe as well :) (Heck, she's *supposed* to look like
a mage...)
