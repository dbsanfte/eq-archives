There are very few tailored items that are much better than stuff available 
cheaply on the open market, before you get to the real high end stuff. Vale 
leather just isn't that great - why sweat and slave over making things with 
1 or 2 points of WIS per piece when for next to nothing these days you 
could buy things like a foreman's tunic, ulthork sleeves, crystal lined 
slippers, PBBs etc.

There are some nice items that trivial below 250, but I don't really think 
a level 18 is up to farming small pieces of acrylia for a 10 WIS cloak, 
etc.

I have a wood elf druid, who is a 160 tailor. I started learning the skill 
as I played, when I was getting pelts from xping on bears and wolves etc. 
By the time I got to the sort of level where I could make imbued mithril 
studded leather I already had better equipment in virtually every slot (I 
made myself some boots, that was about it I think).

Finally seems to have paid off now I have my acrylia studded cloak and 
acrylia reinforced tunic, though (not quite sure how I lucked out on that 
one).
