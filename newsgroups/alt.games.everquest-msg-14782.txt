Or from another perspective.... how about they make a point of crashing
all the servers so anyone who is considering playing AO runs out and
gets a copy on day one.  Sources I've checked with expect AO to be
released in a very unsatisfying condition, many making unflattering
comparisons to EQ at release, and those of us who survived week one of
EQ know just how ugly that was.  Exposing any potential lost customers
to AO at that early stage may just underscore how good EQ is today.  AO
has great potential and if its still around in six months or so I'll
probably give it a try, but the game being played on day one of release
doesn't sound very appealing to me.
