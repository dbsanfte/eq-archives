I totally agree!! I remember my first days.... and how excited I was when I
leveled from 6 to 7 or so.... learning all the new things...

My main is now lvl 41 and i'm starting to have fun again after losing
interrest in the early thirties levels...I had fun though all the way up to
thirty or so! And I still have!
