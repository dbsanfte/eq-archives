Plus only one set of your chars from one server can go to legends and
only up to 8 characters. So what you have to do is transfer the other
characters you'd want on legends to one main account .. then transfer
all those characters to legends. You can transfer 1 - 8 chars but only
from the same server. In otherwords, your additional chars are going
to be

1) naked, since they went through a server transfer

2) its going to cost you 50 bucks per server move of characters to the
consolidation server.


This is all in the FAQ at the legends site.
