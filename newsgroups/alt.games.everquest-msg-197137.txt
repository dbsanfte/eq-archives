ah, if I tell you, then I gotta kill you, hehe. Actually, we are a small 
guild and none of the other regular players know I post here, don't want 
to get someone's nose outta joint because someone from the newsgroup 
came begging for stuff, that wouldn't be nice would it?

We've been adding folks that we group with who seem to be a good fit ie: 
not loot hogs, can listen to simple instructions like /assist the MA and 
ZONE NOW!!!!, are literate and mature enough that they don't act like a 
12 year old and whine all the time, and don't get too upset about deaths 
(we die alot, 2 tonight).  We seem to be doing well so far, even tho we 
aren't up to a full group of regular players yet.  The guild is big 
enough that if all players were on at the same time we'd kick some butt, 
unfortunately our roster has alot of alts on it.
