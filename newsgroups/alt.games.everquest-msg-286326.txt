Yay another patch and 3 or 4 more emergency patches to fix broken
stuff and plug new exploits.

*** Highlights ***

- AA Window Changes: The AA window has been revamped and many of the
AA lines have been consolidated to make them easier to find.

The biggest change you'll notice when you first open the AA window is
that there are only 4 tabs now - General, Archetype, Class and
Special. The first three tabs are fairly self explanatory and the
Special tab will hold any AA that doesn't fit into other tabs. For
example, the "Glyph" (expendable) AAs will be on the Special tab and
various AAs that have been used for progression for several expansions
will live on this tab as well.

With the new UI, there are a series of drop down menus you can use to
view only certain sets of AAs. Additionally, all of the column
headings can be clicked to order the visible AAs by that column in
either forward or reverse alphabetical order. Finally there is a "Can
Purchase" button in the new UI that will narrow the list down to only
the AAs that you currently qualify to purchase. 

In the past, new AAs have been created that were pure upgrades to
existing AA lines from previous expansions. These added many ranks of
similar abilities, each with its own name.  To cut down on the amount
of data that each of the new tabs holds, many of those types of AA
lines have been consolidated into a single line. This should make it
easier for you to see where you are in a line without the need to
search through multiple tabs. You will still have all of the AAs you
had previously, but their names and ranks may have changed and you may
need to recreate hotkeys for some of the abilities in order to ensure
you are using the highest rank's effect.  

- Item Window Changes: The Item Window has a new look and some helpful
new functionality.  We've changed the window to be easier to read and
you will now find a button in the middle of the window that will let
you toggle between the item's base stats and its stats with
augmentations.  In addition, the name of the item will change colors
depending on if you can use it or not.

- Triple Attack has been implemented as a skill for those classes that
had it innately before.  You will automatically receive the
appropriate skill for your level with this patch.  Characters becoming
eligible for triple attack after the patch can receive it by visiting
their guild master.

- Misty Thicket Revamp: Halflings across the world of Norrath rejoice
as the hills of Misty Thicket flourish into a new paradise.


*** Recently Reported Issues ***

While some of the other issues that were resolved in this update were
reported via bug reports, here are a few we'd like to highlight this
update.

Issue: Guilds not able to send guild wide emails with text in the
body. 
Summary: All of the players in the guild are able to send in game mail
messages to the entire guild that have text in the main body. The
email is sent, there is a subject line, but none of the text entered
in the body of the mail. 
Status:  In-Game emails should now send correctly to guilds. The
maximum message size is now set to 4500 characters.  The address list
will display "Too many addresses to display" if it is longer than 500
characters but the message will still be sent.

Issue: Enchanter Epic 1.5
Summary: The Cryptic Page in Ocean of Tears could no longer be located
after the zone was revamped.
Status:  The note was moved to an island to make it easier to find.

Issue: Task - Pepe's Got a Brand New Bag
Summary: NPC Rion is not giving the correct item for the task 'Pepe's
Got a Brand New Bag'.
Status:  If you ask Rion "Where is Pepe?" after you receive the poison
sac back from Rion, he will now properly give you the doll.
 
Issue: Black Wolf Tooth
Summary:  Players are unable to find the drop 'Black Wolf Tooth' for
an armor quest.
Status: The black wolf tooth was added to other black wolves
throughout the newbie areas of the game.

specifically to destroy Draz Nurakk.

useable in socket type 8 in addition to socket type 7.
- Re-added the spell focus effect back to Valorium Belt of Devotion
that was mistakenly removed.
- Increased the number of items summoned by Ton Po's Mystical Pouch
and by Dusty Worker's Soriz Pouch from 20 to 100.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Lowered the minimum players required to attack Rallos Zek's final
form in Plane of Tactics to 6 people. 
- Updated the valid zone for some older Ocean of Tears quests to the
new Ocean of Tears.
- The Goblin Dojo event can now be started with 6 players instead of
12. 
- Added faction adjustments to several raids in Ashengate.
- The Monk epic event in the Ocean of Tears will again spawn a reward
chest.


*** Spells ***

- To help balance the way healing items work from class to class,
healing-based AAs no longer work on heals cast from items.  Items that
cast healing spells that are not castable by normal players and were
previously affected by healing AAs have had their healing amount
increased accordingly. 
- The 30 second global cool down on the bard song Brusco's Boastful
Bellow has been changed to a 30 second spell cool down.
- The spell cool down on Bind Affinity has been removed.

dealings.
- The Hatchet and Redfang events in Demi-Plane of Blood will now drop
back flag items.
- Bark at the Moon and Rampaging Servant pets will now enrage
properly.
- Mage pets from The Serpent's Spine will now spawn pre-equipped with
a full set of Phantom Plate armor.


*** Tradeskills ***

- New Cultural Symbol QUESTS have been implemented.  At this time it
is only the quests, and not the other upcoming cultural drop changes.
If you still have one of the old quests they can still be completed.
The NPCs will still respond.  The target NPCs are still up and still
dropping the items as they were before.  You just will not be able to
get the new quests any more as the NPCs will now only give out the new
quests.
- The recipe for making the unfired runed potion vials used for
throwing have changed.  There are no new items, just a reorganization
of what is used in order to make them less expensive to create.  The
Art of Delicate Throwing Things books have been updated with recipes
that match the changes.
- The alchemy potions Distillate of Antidote X, Distillate of
Immunization X, and Distillate of Regeneration X now require Hypericum
instead of Wormwood.  You can find Hypericum where you would find
Wormwood.
- Fixed the naming on the pattern books to match the patterns they
make.
- Fixed the failure return on some Fishy brewing.
- Fixed the Additive in the spell research recipe for War March of the
Mastruq.


*** Missions ***

- The task leader should no longer change when the leader zones.
- Zhisza - Counter Attack: All 3 major (named) mission targets will
now return home when idle if they have moved from their spawn
location. 


*** AA ***

- Consolidated many AA lines. AAs that were logical extensions of
previous abilities have been consolidated into single lines. For
example instead of 5 different AA lines to increase critical spell
hits, there will now be 1 AA line with more ranks.
- There are 4 new expendable AAs available:
* Glyph of Stored Life - Stores some of your heath in a protective
shield around yourself. Your health is returned when your protection
fades or is lost.
* Glyph of Frantic Infusion - This ability increases the damage done
by your pet in three steps. The first step will increase your pet's
minimum damage by 10%, the next by 15% and the final step by 20%.
* Glyph of Angry Thoughts - This ability increases the hate you
generate by 30%.
* Glyph of Courage - This ability increases many forms of damage.
- There are now additional ranks of the AA "Mastery of the Past".
Ranks 4 through 9 will allow you to increase the maximum level of
spells that are immune to fizzling to the following levels: 61, 63,
65, 66, 68, 70.  Note that the new Mastery of the Past AAs are tied to
the level cap increase expansions. Ranks 4, 5 and 6 are Omens of War
AAs and Ranks 7, 8 and 9 are Serpent Spine AAs.
- Added Mastery of the Past to all casting classes which did not have
the AA previously.
- Corrected issues with Touch of the Cursed in certain instances.
- Spell Casting Deftness, Quick Damage, and Quick Buff now work on
spells with a minimum casting time of 3 seconds instead of 4 seconds
so they are consistent with how spell casting foci work.
- Alternate Abilities that are interrupted by player death will now
have their timers reset appropriately. 


*** Zones ***

- Misty Thicket Revamp: Halflings across the world of Norrath rejoice
as the hills of Misty Thicket flourish into a new paradise.
- Buffs will no longer count down while you are in the Guild Lobby.
- The entry orb into Solteris now allows 85/15 entry into the zone.
- The Kerra Catfish, thought to recently be extinct, have been found
again and are breeding strongly.
- Characters should no longer get stuck in the geometry when Level of
Detail is set to minimum in The Buried Sea zone.
- The Ghost's Vengeance spell will no longer cause the Ghost, Guardian
of Razorthorn event to crash.
- The Atlas entry for Ocean of Tears should now point to the new map.
- Moved one of the fights with King Odeen away from the hot springs.
Hopefully this will improve performance for some players.  Also
reduced the number of NPCs in the zone by about one third.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- A long and outstanding projectile weapon problem has been fixed.
Previously, if you shot an arrow or a projectile spell such as a
firebolt, the visual representation of the projectile would actually
hit its target after the player was notified of the hit.  Now it is
syncronized such that the output to the player's chat window is
appropriately updated with the projectile hit information when the
visual representation of the projectile actually hits its target.
- The /who command should now process quicker.
- The Tip Window for Dragons of Norrath merchants should now show
correctly.
- Solvents that destroy augments now display a destroy message instead
of safely remove message.
- Drakkin should now receive the level up messages directing them to
new zones at level 20, 25, and 30.
- /melody now terminates for bards when they get silenced.  They
should no longer get spammed with "You can't cast now, because you are
silenced" messages.
- Loot permissions are now passed as part of corpse messages and are
updated to the world when loot permissions are changed except if a
corpse is ported to another zone.
- If a merchant has no items to sell, it will now use the welcome that
contains no item names.
- Armor should no longer disappear after using illusions.
- Updating the price of an item without changing the price will no
longer increment item count in the bazaar search.
- After attempting to invite a player that does not exist or is not
logged in, an error "Player soandso was not found." is now displayed
in red text.
- The Link All button will now wrap links onto the following chat
line. This will allow a list of items spread over multiple lines to be
sent over chat channels.  If the amount of text is long enough that a
link can't fit on the line without exceeding the text limit, only the
links that fit will be shown.
- You can drag corpses through teleporters once again.
- When auto attacking an NPC, characters will no longer lose a
fraction of a second from the delay on each swing.
- Faction losses/gains while shrouded (not in a monster mission) will
now affect your main character appropriately.
- Players that camp out on a boat and use the Return Home button
should now get sent back to their home city.


*** User Interface Changes ***

- A problem has been addressed and fixed regarding full screen mode.
Previously, users would experience "bleed through" where background
applications would sometimes draw through the EverQuest window in full
screen mode, and where the mouse cursor might periodically change to
the background application's mouse cursor.  This mouse issue appears
to have been fixed, and the "bleed through" of background application
drawing has been significantly reduced.
- GUI handling of containers with an odd number of slots has been
changed.  The last slot will be aligned with the container icon if it
exists.  This could affect some custom UI skins.
- Using the escape key to close the petition window should no longer
cause a crash to desktop.
- Froglok characters should now appear with their selected look after
character creation.
- Vah Shir and Guktan illusions should now appear with matching heads
and body colors.

- Changed -

EQUI_PotionBeltWnd.xml
EQUI_AAWindow.xml
EQUI_ItemDisplay.xml
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml
EQUI_DynamicZoneWnd.xml


*** Previously Updated ***

- Lowered the hit point value for all of the adds spawned in the
mission "Counter Attack" in Zhisza.
- Reduced the hit points of several of the adds in the mission
"Confront Emperor Vaakiszh."
