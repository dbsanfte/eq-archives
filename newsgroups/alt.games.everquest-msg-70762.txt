Observations on wood elf and dark elf females:
Leather legs: bad. Especially on wood elves (lederhosen)
Chain legs: good. 
Plate legs: good.
Chain tunic: very good. 
Chain tunic with plate arms: very good.
Plate bp with chain sleeves: very bad. 
Plate bp with leather legs: very bad. 
(The arm and leg armor needs to look like it can carry the weight of a
huge padded plate BP, which pretty much means plate arms and legs)

Observations on wood elves, both genders:
Chain tunic will fix almost anything, especially for male characters.
Visible chain hat: very bad.

Observation on Velious armors:
I hope and pray the textures, at least for the leather armors, will be
added to the Luclin graphics soon. Having ry'gorr look like regular
chain isn't too bad when the chain looks good, but when you had
something that looked like tizmak or kelp of various colors and you're
given boring plain leather whether you like it or not...
I also hope and pray the skin tint on gnomeskin armor won't be fixed.
