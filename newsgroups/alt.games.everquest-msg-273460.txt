I'm a cleric and can get to the highborn area with 2 casts of ITU and one 
normal invis pot.
Entrance to golems = itu x 1;golems area = invis pot; golems to highborn = 1 
itu cast.
More of the area past the golems is safe with ITU.  Theres a few mobs that 
are live.  I thing there's a hand like the one found in Unrest and also a 
room of live mobs somewhere. (it's been a while)
Just con each mob that doesn't look like the standard undead mob model for 
veksar and you'll be safe enough.
