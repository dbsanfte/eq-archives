I have to ask, is documentation ingame and in the box so scant these
days that a true newbie would come into the game for the first time
thinking this?  I mean, let's assume for a moment that it never occurs
to them that a gameworld might have different starting cities for
different races (after all, there are plenty of RPGs with cities that
are home to many different races, although frequently it's, for
example, a human city with a dwarf or gnome ghetto), isn't there
something in the box and ingame during character creation that shows
you that if you're a dwarf, you're starting in Kaladim, if you're a
dark elf, it's Neriak, etc etc, and that this is a different starting
location from other races?

Golly, how did we ever manage before PoK?
