I also refuse to attack anything that cons higher than "indifferent."

There are lots of ways to fight alone but role-play with other characters.
One of my favorites is to do "driveby" rescues then slip away Lone Ranger
style. I did one last night with my Ranger. I noticed a caster had just
killed a Wandering Greenblood, then fell down bleeding to death. A quick
cast of light healing and she was up. When she said "You saved my life." I
just blushed, bowed, and ran away. It would have been easy to let her die
and loot her kill, but this particular character would never have thought of
it. Speaking of which...

Another very fun and interesting to play solo-fighting role-player is to be
a "split personality" or someone with a dual life. Behave one way in town
and differently out in the field. Do quests that build your faction up, then
commit despicable acts when no one is looking. (Daggerfall had an
interesting take on this -if you committed a crime unseen (including murder)
it did not count against your reputation in the community. Shoplifting was a
fun and profitable, albeit risky vocation. You never knew when the guards
might be by.)

A lot of people without even knowing it are practically role-playing the
lone "Mountain Man" when they spend hours farming hides and silks, then when
their packs are full head to wherever to sell them. Of course this was a
better RP opportunity before the ability to 'bot sell in the Bazaar.

I also role-play when people want ports, heals, and the ever popular SOW.
