The explanation that was given to me is that when you are very close to
death, you will sometimes zone to a safe spot where there is a low
likelyhood of trains or roaming mobs.  It's a safety feature for the
character.

I've also noticed recently that all enchantments/buffs/debuffs, etc., are
now being stripped.  My necro zoned with 10hp and was dying
(diseased/poisoned).  When I got across, I was further out than expected and
my shielding, poison, disease, and strength icons were all gone.  Gave me
time to bandage.
