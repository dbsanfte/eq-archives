I fixed my problem with this.  Not sure if you are having the same problem,
but mine was with my BIOS settings.  After I installed the new video card
and re-loaded DX9 I had to go back and adjust them.  It seems that DX9 was
trying to use the NEW card and the ORIGINAL built-in card.  After I fixed
that problem everything worked great!
Ben

P.S. Make sure you check this AFTER you install DX9
