    It is in a standard XP group, which is where they wanted to be improved.
Really, when the choice is between a monk that will deal 100 DPS non-stop
(and that's low for our guild monks on XP mobs) and a wizard that can
sustain 20 DPS non-stop, who will you tell to go away? Do you pull a single
mob, kill it, sit around for a long time, then go get another, or try to
always have a mob getting killed and a mob parked waiting to get killed?
That is an XP grind, that is efficiency, and that is the one situation in
the game where a wizard blows enormous chunks. Again, the folks at Graffe's
did analysis after analysis, including certain amounts of down time and
looking at how much down time was in those classic "constant pull" groups.
And the answer is always the same - they come up very short.

    No, meaning I won't invite the New Jersey to participate in my small
battle. And if all we ever do is small battles, the crew of the New Jersey
is going to feel pretty damn useless.

    This, I agree with. I don't think the class that is one of the most
wanted at level 60 for raids, and the class that is amongst the best
soloers, and the class that is the centrepiece of the most efficient XP
group in the game can argue that they deserve to be great in standard XP
groups, too. But I think they do have a valid point about how flat their
damage is between 51 and 59, or how they lack damage at lower levels when
soloing and AoE grouping isn't much of an option.

    Actually, you're wrong. They wanted to prove they were worth it in XP
groups so they could get rid of all the bad press surrounding wizards.
Asking for improvements is a long, generally fruitless task - witness your
class and how long it took to get a miserable 20 Defense points.

    So you're saying that your XP grind groups kill more mobs per unit time
when you replace a melee damage dealer with a wizard?

    Good lord, you do if you plan to kill those mobs again, and again, and
again like the standard XP group does!

    They are in this area. I agree with you on a class-as-a-whole basis, but
not in this area.

    Your class gets crapped on because of how relatively weak you are. If a
group is looking for someone to just deal damage and never take aggro,
rogues are better, monks are better, and warriors are almost as good. If a
group is looking for someone to TAKE damage, well.... I looked up the Magelo
profiles of my guild's rangers, level 60, mains. HPs ranged from 2400
unbuffed to to high of 2993 unbuffed, unbuffed AC was in the 1100-1200
range.

    I have 2283 HPs unbuffed, and 950 AC. And a lot of my gear is crap for
someone in a top-tier guild, like Thurg plate instead of Skyshrine/Kael. A
better example of a top-tier cleric, Nvenia, is sitting at 2309 HPs unbuffed
(she isn't a HP freak like me) and 1100 AC.

    Would you let your cleric tank a mob? Would it be terribly efficient?
It's not much different from letting the ranger tank. Wouldn't you rather
let, say, a paladin (average unbuffed HPs, our guild: 3500), shadow knight
(3300 HPs), or warrior (4700 HPs) tank? Hell, our MONKS are all over 1200 AC
and 3000 HPs unbuffed - all they lack is a method of gaining aggro at will.
They're certainly better on the healing efficiency than the rangers,
assuming they can hold aggro. You folks don't need AC, despite how you've
cried and wailed for it. You need *hit points*, so a CH can at least come
close to being as effective on you as it is on other classes. As it is now
you have Bard HPs, and that doesn't cut it.
