There was someone over in the DAoC group who totally went insane over males
playing female characters.  You might find it amusing if you can find it on
Google.  He felt that it either meant you wanted to be female and were
probably gay, or that it meant you were trying to deceive people.

He had no problem with people who are human in RL playing trolls or elves.
He said that wasn't deceptive, because everyone else would know that you
aren't a troll or elf in RL, since there *aren't* trolls or elves.  There
are females, though, so it is deceptive for a non-female to play one.  I
don't recall if anyone ever asked him if this applied to classes (there are
clerics in RL, so does this mean atheists in RL should not play clerics in a
game?), or if we all just wrote him off as a total idiot and ignored him
from them on.

Hmmm...wonder what he thinks of white people playing dark-skinned races, or
black people playing light-skinned races?

Anyway, I too have played characters of both sexes, although I've tended
toward males, and that *is* because I'm male.  My general tendency has been
that if the character is going to be almost always played solo or with
people I know in RL or will get to know well enough in game to use real
names, then the character can be whatever sex fits in with the role playing
background I'm making for them.

However, if the character is likely to be in a lot of one-or-two-or-so time
groups, I'll tend toward male.  Despite what the PC people would like us to
believe, there are differences in the way men and women socialize, and so
there are less likely to be problems if people match the gender of their
characters.
