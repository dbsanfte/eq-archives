ROFL
That much I managed to do with my very first EQ character (a Paladin
I deleted and replaced with Kaev due to a misunderstanding of how
faction worked).  I won't talk about how long it took my to find him.

Entering the Hall of Truth turn right, open the door you come to
immediately on your right and go up the stairs.  Up on the balcony
there you can find a female Paladin who will send you on an optional
sub-quest that gives you info on the Soulfire quest (it's a complete
waste of time, IMO), a male Paladin who will gladly give you a quest
for a worthless (ac3) shield that requires you to kill a shark that
easily crushes an untwinked L5, and Valoren himself.  I have not
poked around since they added the new newbie quests, so I dunno
which NPCs give the armor and weapon quests.

Good Luck Grasshopper!
