HASTE.

HASTE.

Oh, yeah, HASTE.

The options here are Silver Chitin Handwraps and FBSS, both of which are 
pricey but will definitely pay their own way in increased damage output. 
Haste items do not stack[1] so one is enough.

AC is good, and AGI (which translates into AC) is also good. HPs are also 
good.

If you have two wu's trance sticks (wow, thats some twinkage, but they 
don't proc until 35) you may want to get a 2hb weapon so you can keep that 
skill high as well. Always max 2hb and HTH as well as 1hb, as you do NOT 
want to practice one of these after letting it lapse. WR bags are very 
nice, but make sure the bag itself is not super heavy. Herbalist Pack is a 
good option in this area.

Also (something I have not yet gotten) any kind of regen item is supposed 
to be godlike for helping solo.

Feign Death will be your best friend in the whole wide world.

~Empty, speaking for Wasain, a 29th Monk of Drinal.

[1] With the exception of "spell" haste items and "bard" haste items (like 
the Robe of the Whistling Fists), which *do* stack.
