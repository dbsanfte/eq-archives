Everquest is not a manual dextarity game if you want to play with buttons
and joystick controls go to your local arcade and put 50 cents in a
streetfighter machine. I am a 60 Monk and to be honest I spend way too much
time laying on the ground. As a puller it is my job to bring 1 and only 1
mob to the group at a time, then go get the next mob while they are killing
the one I just brought. If you want to play with the keys try a Rogue, you
can attack, backstab, evade, pick pockets, disarm and apply poisons.
