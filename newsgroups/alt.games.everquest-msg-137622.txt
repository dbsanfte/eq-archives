    On Quellious, the market has already adapted and stuff doesn't sell for
below vendor value. I made sure of that. ;-) Adamantine Epaulets sell for
100+ pp to a vendor, SSoY for 200+ pp, Kunark arms/helms/gloves for 333 pp
or so, etc. I cleaned up that market ASAP. Those prices are with 110 or
higher CHA and at least indifferent faction, BTW.

> i.e. jewelcraft items .... what they sell for to vendor:

    In general, an enchanted JC item will sell for slightly more than the
combined cost of the gem and the bar of metal from a vendor. So a Gold
Jasper earring, say, would sell to a vendor for slightly more than the cost
of a gold bar (10 pp) and a Jasper (1 pp) combined.
