Hrmm.   Resists and XP desired.

Prophecy Scroll
+8 Wis +2 Cha +50 Mana  (primary melee)
    (for a 41 cleric, that's approximately the same as 14 WIS
    to swap out for resists if needed.)

Beer Stained Coldain Tunic
+12 AC +5 Str +5 Sta +5 vsMg +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +15 HP
    (resists)

Finely Crafted Velium Ring
+2 AC +3 Sta +3 Agi +8 vsFire +15 HP
    (fire resist and good HP with AC -- good combination for a certain
    dragon...)

Crystalized Shadow Helm
+4 AC +2 Wis +2 Int +1 Cha +10 HP +3 Mana
    (good CHA for buying/selling, REAL useful when you get a couple
    more levels and start buying peridots)

Velium Spiked Skull Helm
+10 AC +5 Str +5 Cha +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold
+5 vsPos +5 vsDis +20 Mana
    (more resists, and some CHA too if you didn't get the other drop)

Teacher's Syllabus
+3 Wis +3 Int +20 vsPos +20 Mana
    (range slot WIS/mana item with great poison resist)

Crystalized Shadow Tunic
+18 AC +3 Str +2 Sta +3 Wis +2 Cha +10 HP +5 Mana
    (Decent AC tunic, with STR/STA/HP/mana/CHA.   The other
    pieces in this line all have CHA on them as well)

Yeah, I'd say you missed a bit.
