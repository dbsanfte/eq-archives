You can't divide the raw experience like that.  Relative levels come into
it.  The above only works if all PCs in the group are the same level.

And anyway, the figures above are wrong (hell they are different to the
cited link)
Pasted from Allakhazam:
2 person group - 2% total bonus.
3 person group - 6% total bonus.
4 person group - 10% total bonus.
5 person group - 14% total bonus.
6 person group - 20% total bonus.

A numerical example...

A level 55 warr takes down a level 50 monster, in an ordinary zone (Zone
Experience Modifier (ZEM) of 75).  Dungeons have higher ZEMs which affect
the experience given by a mob.  The formula for experience from a mob kill
is ZEM * (MoB level)^2.

I am using http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/ as my info source.  He
got it from HackersQuest :)

He gets 75 *50*50 = 187,500 XP.  (pre the 51-60 smoothing, a human warr
would need about 45,000,000 xp to get through 55, or about 240 level 50
mobs, SOLO)

Now he groups with his level 60 cleric buddy, and they kill another level 50
mob.

This now yields 75*50*50*1.02=191,250xp.  But it is not shared equally...
The warrior gets 55/(55+60) of the  xp, and the cleric 60/(55+60).  In
figures 91,467 and 99,783 respectively.
A level 57 shammy joins the group, so now the next level 50 mob gives
75*50*50*1.06 xp and they get 55, 57 and 60 parts of (55+57+60)
respectively...

etc etc etc.

As you can see you get less XP *per kill* the more in the group, but you
should be killing more mobs per hour with the tanking / healing / buffing
coming from more players.  I am talking about regular tanking here, not
PBAoE groups as I have no experience of this style of play.

I don't know exactly what the recent changes have done to alter xp for high
end fights has done (I'll let the ShowEQers fill us in on that score) but
the split of xp among the players should not have changed.

Anyhoo, hope that helped.
