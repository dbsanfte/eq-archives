This is interesting, but as far as I can tell has no application to loot
distribution; unless 8 stacks of items have dropped and you intend to roll for
each and every item.

It does seem to hint that the RNG relies on an internal clock on a digit up in
the realm of a second, rather than something sensible like the nanosecond realm
(where your reflexes are not going to influence the odds at all) for its
seed... but when the roll is  a single instance in an hour... you aren't going
to be hitting the "correct" second for your roll either.

Although it might be worth trying as an experiment
