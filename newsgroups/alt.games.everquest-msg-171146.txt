Sadly, I only have one:

Start a new character in a different class.

You are in, arguably, the most IMPOSSIBLE to solo class past the lowbie
levels. If you can still solo anything that's very low blue at 27, then
it's a minor miracle in itself. Being alone all this time, I'd assume
(perhaps wrongly) that you haven't amassed any great fortune of hundreds
of thousands of Plat, nor have you been scooping up top end gear. (These
types of things can make it possible for a rogue to solo much longer
than your level, but I'm guessing you don't have that level of
ubertwinked equipment.)

However, you've probably collected *some* stuff, and bought things,
saved some money, etc. I'd gather up everything you have that's not no
drop, all your cash, etc. and find a trusted person to hold it for you
while you switch to a new character you create. (If you don't know
anyone at all to trust, pick a very high level person from a guild who's
name you recognize. They might not mind helping and doubtless won't want
to hike off with your trash anyway.)

I'd suggest, for your play style, times, and availabilty, either a
necro, druid, mage, or (much harder) a wizard or shaman or BL. Then at
least you can solo effectively if you can't get into a playing pattern
where you can get regular groups.

If you keep trying to solo as a rogue, you're not going to be having a
very fun time in EQ. :-(.  The fact that it took you a year to make
level 27 should be some indicator of that already.
