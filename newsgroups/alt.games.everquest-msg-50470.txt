I meant that is the simplest route via the design and really the most
beneficial until you are quite uber. Being pro giant you really have
to be pretty uber before its of much advantage.

I do all that on dragon faction too while still being allied with
them. We do west wastes and all outdoor dragons and parts of north
tov.

I still think it is really until you are pretty darn uber. In both of
these cases we are talking about uber stuff. If you are not in a big
guild your only chance of velious quest armor is getting it in drops
from kael if you are lucky enough to be in pickup groups. Velious
overall for the more casual gamer seems more anti giant to me. People
DO get pick up groups in kael and manage to get quest armor (when my
guild was doing POG and stuck in that mode, one paladin in my guild
actually got ALL his plate thurg quest armor in small groups in kael
he organized on his own) Maybe you can do similar things in TOV but I
don't think so.

Yes, I sort of agree.. its TOO easy. I am probably kos with yelinak
but just got to ally with Cov again for a ss quest armor. Our guild
was flip flopping about giant or dragon since many of us were dragon
allied from trying to get the kael drops for thurg quest armor (again,
before we were at a point where we felt we could do tov.. it all comes
down to that) but once the skyshrine armor quest givers in Skyshrine
were only COV, it solidified our choice and gave us what we feel was
the most room. I don't think we are probably uber enough to take the
dain though not sure. We just got to the tormax/statue point a while
back.. I guess tormax is one of the harder mobs so does that mean we
can take the Dain? We don't even know!! ;) We are kind of learning
this stuff as we go along.

Ah yeah, I was in error. Another guy explained how you cover that in
killing the dain and other named dwarves. I thought it was more
complex than that.

It still comes down to you or your guild's uberness though. For the
people not at that point the thurg quest armor from killing giants,
which will make them kos with giants quite fast, is the only choice. I
don't think everyone level 55 or above is in a guild that does POG (or
in a pog benefiting class) or whichever part of TOV. For them the
design of velious locks them into being an enemy of giants if they
want good armor.
