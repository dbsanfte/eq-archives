Not to mention the fact that the article straight-up said that Ebaying items
was the root of the idea for Sony.

"The inspiration for the Sony initiative, said House, came from participants
in online subscription games who sell virtual goodies they've earned in the
game on EBay Inc.'s auction site, sometimes for thousands of dollars."

I've yet to see "virtual goodies" for Crash Bandicoot or SOCOM on Ebay.
