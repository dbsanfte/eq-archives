For dungeons, I'd take out Curse of Simple Mind and Alacrity. Shuffle
them with Clarity if you have to, make room for two AE stuns (Color
Flux and Shift?).  Need them to survive the nasty trains.

depending what doing, if soloing and doing mez/nuke/stun system, then
use the level 4 one, its gonna be broken 6 seconds later with a nuke
anyways.  If in dungeons, I always used enthrall or whatever latest
was. Extra cast time and mana is a non issue. To me anyways.

Paw was fun for my chanter in 30's. Tough getting group, but once get
going it goes fast.  Try Cazic out, seems like Upper Zig was good too.

If want the fast boring non loot outside xp, since got 29, drop
everything and goto Overthere. With illusions and Benevolence or
whatever faction spell 29 gets, you can shop at the outpost and even
do the quests.

Dalnirs is good in early 30's too, but need to bring your own group,
my mage is usually only one in zone for hours on Mith Marr anyways.
