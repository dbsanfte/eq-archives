I don't know if you are able to do "hard" adventures yet, but many of my
guildies are getting upgrades from drops. This is a guild that is farming
many PoP mobs and is in VexThall. These LDoN drops are very nice. Save your
points, consider them a bonus from gaining exp. Once you get to the
"required" level, you will have even more points for your UBER earrings,
maybe you can get the UBER ring to match.
