Get yourself a set of Crafted armor (the armor which is quested from the 
Centaurs in South Karana).  You should even be able to quest it all just 
fine at your level, and have fun doing it.  Crafted is such good armor that 
many warriors keep it until they replace it with their Planes armor.  I've 
looked at the stats for Ry'Gorr armor but they just seem slightly less than 
Crafted to me - I'm sure it is much more interesting to non-Warrior classes.

A few items which are slight improvements over Crafted and are relatively 
common to find at East Auctionlands are: Gauntlets Of The Black go for 1kpp 
or less now (if you see them at 500pp GRAB 'EM, they are well worth it).  
Crested Spaulders are a bit more useful than Crafted Spaulders in my 
opinion.  And the Skull Shaped Barbute, while sacrificing only 1 AC, gets 
you 7 more Magic Resistance than the Crafted Helm, a more than fair trade.

"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who
learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating
argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely
arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself--a
barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits atrocity also commits those
future atrocities thus bred."
