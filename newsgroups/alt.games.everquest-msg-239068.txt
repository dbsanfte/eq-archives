And theres the source of my frustration. Ill be using mine for the
forseeable future.  Next logical upgrade for me would be Statue BP ( been
drooling over that for a while now ), or an Ornate BP.  Statue is out of
reach at current due to guild having problems, and possibly imploding, and
Ornate, *laugh* 1/4 - 1/2 Million Plat, if you can find the mold in the
bazaar, and as far as farming it from BoT mini's, just havent been lucky
there yet. With those 2 options basically closed off to me, Im not saving up
Tak points for the royal attendent bp of sand. Ive ground out over 4k
Adventure points... I can grind out another 1500 for the BP + another 2k odd
points for the necessary Augs........ But like I said... thats not happening
any yime soon.
