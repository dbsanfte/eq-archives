OUCH, in weeping my guts out,

what a bunch of self-righteous, ameobic, flaccid, waste of dna you all are,
you lot couldnt flame your way out of a paper back that was on fire. Go get
an education then come up with something original, instead of the usual
standard responses. My only pain comes from the fact that could not come up
with something better.
BTW do you all feel better now, feel like REAL men, you said a few harsh
over a newsgroup, whoo hoo, you are real bunch a badasses. Did you enjoy
scrawling your inane pizzle, drafting your best, most acidic, comments, LOL
Im off to the trekker ng's, now those are true hard men.

PS The only decent response came from Mark, well done.
