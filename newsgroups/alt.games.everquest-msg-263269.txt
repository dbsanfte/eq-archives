I think a lot of it has to do with making things 'easier' for casual
players and power gamers to coexist.  Locked encounters will mean there
is no kill stealing (if you don't have the killer equipment to drop a
mob before somebody else jumps in), more instanced areas (including epic
encounters mean that they won't be camped 24x7 preventing others from
getting in).  No more raid guilds training entire dungeons over each
other because they weren't there first, etc.

Raid sizes might also help the casual player, if raids are limited to
four groups of six, prep time won't really be that big of an issue (not
sure if it is now, never went on a full scale raid in EQL).  I'm not
sure if the way they are handling death would be easier for the casuals,
but it looks like corpse runs are out.  If that is the case, it will be
a lot friendlier to people who don't have the time to do the runs (my
brother was on a 14 hour raid, he said about half of it was corpse
runs - he wasn't happy :P).

Small things like that make it easier for people who don't have an
abundance of time to play.
