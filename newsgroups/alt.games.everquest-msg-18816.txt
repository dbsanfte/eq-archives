Actually yes.  The Jarsath scale was left in my account, all my food and
water, some spells, my tizmet armor, and lowbie fire resist gear was all
left in my bank account.  Why, I have no idea.  I also don't know why
they didn't clean my character out, as she had some nice items on her,
but not a single piece of that was missing.

My password *at the time* was love69.  Not the name of a character, not
a password I've ever used before, just something made up on the spur of
the second.

I'm gonna pout and whine about it for a couple of weeks, get back on the
game, and play again.  <shrug>  Not much more that *can* be done.
