 > knows the guidelines but chooses not to follow them

guidelines set by who? you?  Why should I do as you say?  Just because 
you prefer bottom posting, why should everyone else follow your 
preferred method of posting?

i don't give a damn what you think.  If you don't like me top posting 
then you'll either have to ignore me or get used to it cause i aint 
gonna stop posting or change how i post because of a couple of 
arse-holes trying to impose their own sanctemonious ideals on me.

Some people prefer bottom-posting, some people prefer all sorts of 
things that i don't - i don't try to intimidate them in to doing things 
the way i like them to be done.

As I said - I read from the top-down, not the bottom-up, having to 
scroll past posts i've already read in order to get to the new post is 
something i find highly annoying.  Why not just quote the bit you are 
referring to, so that people know what you are replying to, (as done 
above) and then put the rest of the post after your reply to allow 
people to read the full post if they choose to.  This way you don't 
force them to scroll down lines and lines of quoted text, when you only 
really need them to read one short quote in order to know what you are 
talking about.

 > who doesn't use OE

That's right I don't.  Another preference of mine - I use Mozilla.  I 
suppose you're gonna have a go at me about that as well?

This is the last I will say on the matter.  I have explained my views. 
If you don't agree with them then that's fine.  I don't agree with your 
views, but if you hadn't brought the matter up then I wouldn't have 
given you a hard time over it.

To quote my original post about this "Sometimes people do things you 
find annoying, that's life - deal with it!"
