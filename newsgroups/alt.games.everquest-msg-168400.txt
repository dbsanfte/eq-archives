The combo of decent loot and good exp in the high 30's is killing
Cyntia in Rathe Mountain at the gypsie camp.  She is not on any
faction, spawns like a clockwork every 6 min, and drops about 100 pp
an hour in pp, gems etc. And you have a merchant closeby.  The
important thing is to hit her as she pops, before she can get her
annoying damage shields, pets etc up.
