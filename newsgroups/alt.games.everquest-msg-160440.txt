More than half my guild still doesn't have PoP, as most of them
are in europe and still awaiting deliveries for one reason or
another.  Most common complaint, they can no longer find anyone
to play with.

Why?  Because we are all in PoP.

Can you wonder why?  PoP zones are rich in experience.  61+
levels require exp by the bucketful.

I went on a CR to Velks, where I used to solo for decent exp, on
the rare occaisions when it wasnt' so overcamped that I could
find mobs.  Body was up in Top.  I had to kill three spiders and
two statues on the way up, all green.  It was like getting those
annoying Tizmak Warriors on you at 50.  A) there should not be
anywhere near that many mobs alive in Velks, its just wrong.  B)
They shouldn't be green, its contrary to all my expectations!

Then I got talked into a Ssraa group, "for massive exp" they
said.  I made disparaging remarks but came along, because these
are my guildmates and friends, and what the heck.  We carved a
large and entrail lined swath thru the place, dropping mobs fast
enough to get thru the Trial of Execution.  People dinged AA,
dinged real, and generally had a fine exp rich experience.  I got
3% of 62 in 4 hours.

I'll continue to go to pre PoP zones for quests, for phat lewts,
for my friends... but you'll never catch me going there actually
looking for exp unless someone posts a claim here that zone X
camp Y is still great... and then only because I'll want to test
that claim with the silvery spoon of skepticism

Bergh "you call this a train?? Its one green mob and I'm happy to
kill it for you or let you have the exp, whatever you like"
