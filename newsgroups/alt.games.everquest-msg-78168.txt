Ok, I'm wondering if anyone can give me some ideas here, or if this is even
possible.

I have a Half-Elf Warrior, follows Rallos Zek.  Now, I spend a lot of time
building my factions (I'm also a faction nut - damn you enchanters and
rogues) because I like to go anywhere I want and other various reasons.
Well, the places that I would really like to be able to get into, but can't,
are the homes to my darker friends, the trollies, ogres, and my dark
cousins.
Is there a way to improve factions with any of these folk, or am I not good
enough for them?
