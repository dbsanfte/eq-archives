OK, I was in Barnes & Noble tonight and there it was: The Everquest
Roleplaying Game Players Handbook, so, like the little Verant bitch that I
am, I bought it. :-)

Anyone else pick this up?

Haven't had a chance to look at it yet.  I'll put it next to my computer,
and read it while medding.  From glancing through it at the bookstore,
though, some things were obvious.

1. It is indeed similar to D&D 3e (which was to be expected, since it uses
the same system).

2. It looks like it goes up to level 30.

3. The magic system is mana based, like EQ.  I think that is what I'm most
curious about, since in D&D, the magic system is NOT mana based.  The D&D
magic system is based on preparing spells beforehand.  (The explanation in
game terms for this is that casting a spell consists of a long series of
steps that you do in the morning to gather the magical power and get it
ready to do whatever it is the spell does...leaving just a relatively simple
triggering step to complete the spell.  It is that triggering step you do
when you cast the spell later).  This makes D&D Wizards, for example, quite
different from EQ Wizards.  A D&D Wizard will actually be good with a
weapon, and will often use it in fights, saving his limited spells until
they are really needed.  (Like in EQ, though, D&D Wizards don't have a lot
of HP and don't have good armor, so that weapon is typically something like
a crossbow, so they can stay away from the monster).
