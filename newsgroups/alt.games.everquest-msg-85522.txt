Wow. I've not heard it with *quite* such golddigger overtones before,
although I guess they're implied. Here it means more "golden on the outside
full of cream on the inside", like your "twinky" candy thingies.

Its far more of an older-leer-at-younger-tottie type comment....

Weird. My guild has a fair few gay and bi members. Nobody has a problem
with "twink". It was bloody confusing the other day when I said I had
to "tweak" something, meaning "tweak", and they though tI meant "Twink"
though ;)
