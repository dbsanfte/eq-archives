Sorry but to say that someone who lost a best friend wouldn't be playing is
just ignorant in my opinion. I know that one of the reasons I play EQ is to
get away from Real Life... when is one time that I wanna get away?
DEFINTELTY when Im depressed, angry, etc. It's ignorant, and cold hearted to
say that automatically he's being a troll. Think of how many ppl are hurt by
this... ppl react differently... just becuase you wouldn't play eq doesn't
mean someone else wouldn't...
