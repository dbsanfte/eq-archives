Actually I'm not sure that would be too much of a problem.   UO servers also
run on several machines simultaneously, yet a single machine running an
emulator can do the job too.   It just can't support as many users at the same
time.   Our player shard generally averaged between 30 and 40 players at once.
I'm not sure how high it could have gone, since we used some pretty strict
entry requirements to keep those numbers low (and high quality.)

To date though, there are currently no EQ emulators that I am aware of.

I know one was being developed, but the project stalled and was possibly
abandoned.
