Yes, I tried to do this quest about two to three weeks ago and the
interrogator
got to outside the hermit's place and just stood there.
I petitioned and was told by a guide that there was no GMs on that could
help.
I went to bed and the next morning he was still there, so  petitioned again.
A GM eventually told me that the quest is broken and to wait for an
indication in the patch messages to say when it is fixed.

Bristlebane server BTW. But as he said to watch for a patch message
I assume that this applies to all servers
