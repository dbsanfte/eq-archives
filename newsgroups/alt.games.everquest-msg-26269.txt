I jerk around a lot, I am known for it. If it was me, I would get another
character out, something useless that everyone hates like a rogue.<sic> Try
to get a guild invite from the same guild for the rogue. If the guild wants
the rogue too, that means they are building and as odd as this may seem,
they probably want your druid in the guild for the benefits they will
provide your rogue. See what I mean? Your druid is part of an overall plan
vs guild taxi for existing members.

I have yet to see this. With the 10 person minimum for a guild, most guilds
are being nice to their members.
