Personally i got all models off, including horses as the work around, 
been working fine so far.
And since i seen noone else on any boards complain over this yet, lets 
do the standard question:
Did you cast anything while you were medding on horse?
If not, theres your problem.

The workaround make the client think youre not on a horse, but the 
server know you are. This make for a problem with mana regen. Since the 
client dont think your on a horse, it dont think you get the mana regen. 
But the server know your on a horse, and thus give you the mana regen.
Since the differences between those 2 are ONLY corrected when you do 
something that get the client to reload mana values from server 
(casting, using right click items, zoning and so on), you will on your 
screen see mana regen as if you didnt have a horse, UNTILL you cast 
something, then the server will update you, and youll get the true mana 
value.
Before i found that out, i wondered why i could jump from 10% to 50% 
after casting a Cheal.

Try it again, and cast something this time, and lets see if it dont work 
better now.
