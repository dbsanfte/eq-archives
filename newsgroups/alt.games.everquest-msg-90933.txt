I've heard the rogue epic is the easiest to get.  I'll take their word for
it.  My enchanter one isn't so hard, but getting the Fear & Hate pieces when
you're not in an uberguild is a pain in the ass.

Druids have to be near the top of the easiest.  There's only 1 encounter
that require more than a single group to do (that I can think of).  The
Kedge component I believe is the hardest part (getting people to commit to
camping that god-forsaken zone).  Ulump is easy with one 55+ group, and
Faydedar is easy enough with two 55+ experienced groups (with at least a
couple 60 tanks, including warrior).  Druid epic is annoying, not very
difficult.
