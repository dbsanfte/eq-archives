The mob to reset the zone will spawn in the fort itself only after the fort
has been taken over by one of the three factions in the zone.  On zebuxoruk
the war tends to bug out at this point as when one faction controls all
three outpost they never move on the fort so the named mob will spawn.

I usually wait for a patch and then race to Hollowshade before some
item-crazed 60th level ignoramus ruins it for everyone else by starting a
war he doesn't intend to finish.  Especially since the items dropped are of
little use to a character high enough to finish the war.  They should have
better by that level.
