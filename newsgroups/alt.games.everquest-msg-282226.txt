Or more likely lazy programmers.  Do you have any idea how many lines
of code there are to make the entire EQ works?  Add an expansion and
that's good for a few million or so more lines.  Now try reading the
entire thing to check if something would work as intended with no
exploitable side effect.

One has to give SOE some credit for keeping EQ running for so long
when there's plenety of things that are still broken.
