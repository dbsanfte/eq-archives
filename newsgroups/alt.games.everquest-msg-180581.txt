I prefere a SK over any other tank with lvl 65 in BoT so this is not 
only until 40th.

Dont let Rangers tank that levels. you wont have fun. They can but have 
way lower HP and stuff than Plate classes.

hmm ... chanters can CC slow and haste, shamy can sow slow and haste and 
backupheal.

Wrong. Monk is nice but for FD pulling you have the SK as Tank ;)
dont decide on pulling here, go for dmg as you dont have much until now ;)
Monk or Rogue or Beastlord or Mage.
Monk is dmg and FD, thats all.
Rogue is dmg and Closed Doors
Beastlord is good if you decide to go Enchanter, because he has lots of 
Dmg + Buffing + SoW
Mage is good dmg and alot of utility stuff

No Ports ... okay, but no evac == bad ... and Dungeons > Out Door zones.

as I would decide between Shammy Chanter ... you have now:

SK
Cleric
Shammy/Chanter
Monk/Rogue/Beastlord/Mage
1 slot free

I would go for Wizard or Druid.
Wizard: NUKES and evac
Druid: nukes dots DS evac


Have fun...
