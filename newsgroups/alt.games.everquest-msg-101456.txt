Use caution but in the end it comes down to rolling the dice. There is a
good chance that someone will attempt to rip you off, so don't go spending
any cash you can't afford to throw away. I used Playerauctions to buy my 55
necro, and paid a tad over 150 dollars US for it using Paypal from the card.
If it had gone bitter I would have chalked it down as a learning experience.
The transaction does leave a very clear electronic trail but whether it is
worth investing time and effort to act on it is a question each burnt user
has to answer themselves.

Do not kid yourself, lot's of people DO get burnt. I was rather the
surprised that things went smoothly. I would not think of dealing with
anyone with an web based email address (hotmail etc). I was lucky and the
seller had his own work domain and I pulled up the DNS records and got his
address and phone number. He was rather surprised to get a phone call from
me to verify his identity but it did establish he was actually a legitimate
person. Most of the time you won't have this luxery though : (
