I'm relieved half your gear is plate, as I was copping flack about it. I
made it myself in the bazaar (great for plate but pity it doesn't sell
folded metal)

 I've gotten a few pieces with much the same ac but a bit of resists as
well, and it does make things a bit easier; nothing worse than being rooted
and having no long range weapons to shoot back at whatever's casting at you.
I'm sick of people with ubergear, which is why i've pretty much given up on
grouping. Too many loud mouthed braggarts.

I got the ghoulbane a looong time ago on the last day it was salable, from
memory, put it on a paladin in case i ever needed one, and then started
doing the quest anyway, then gave up because i didn't have the resists to
solo unrest and at the time noone else was there (is it busy again?)

My first ever paladin, many years ago, somehow got himself kos to freeport
(might have been trying to help a fellow paladin when i was still naive,
it's blurry now) and then got killed in the ocean of tears falling off the
boat, losing body and all gear and just gave up totally on the character.

Those boats used to be killers. You could walk through wall in to the sea,
and i never figured how to get back in again, and you couldn't fish or do
anything interesting. What a dumb idea that was. I would rather they let you
swim across zones or something. I end up zoning back while watching tv or
reading a book, and having to go through the boredom all over again.
