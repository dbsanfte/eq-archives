Actually, IMHO he is just human.  I've done things like that in dreams
when I knew it didn't matter, and when I woke up things would be normal
again.  And the constant wondering about whether the Land is real or

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
