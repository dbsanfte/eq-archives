Logged out my beastlord late last night to go back to my main, and
crashed
to desktop... a not infrequent occurrance yesterday.

Trying to log back in, my patcher started loading the dx8.dll... odd,
game had never stopped running for a patch.  OK, so I figure it got
corrupted or something, no big deal.  Patcher estimated time ticking
along with all sorts of wild estimates at first, finally settles on 9
minutes 28 seconds, 9 minutes 27 seconds, 9 minutes 26 seconds... so on
until 8 minutes 14 seconds, when the timer stops.  Nothing happens
for at least 10 minutes, well past the estimated time of completion.  I
stop and restart, get the same performance.  Try it a couple more times.
Try it with a total sytem reboot.  Try it after deleting the 0kb file of
that name in my EQ folder.  same thing every time.

OK, well, its late, off to bed, it will be  fixed after the patch, I
say.

This morning I get up, download successfully brings in a text file or
two and then starts with eqgame.exe... and locks up at 3 minutes 11
seconds. Again and again, it loads down to that time and then comes to a
grinding halt.  Giving it 15 minutes to finish its 3 minute job does
nothing, nor does wiping the offending fragment.

Sure am having fun "in our world now"
