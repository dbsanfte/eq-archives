Depends what you want to play.  The warrior is a plate class with much
better armour while the Berserker wears chain.

The closest analogy to the Berserker is a cross between a Paladin/SK
and a Ranger.  The berserker does not have the defining attribute of a
warrior (taunt) but has others ways such as stun to get the attention
of mobs.

They all have their own benefits Vah Shir (safe Fall) Ogre (Stun) Dwarf
(Strength) etc ... really is a personal choice.  I made a Vah Shir
simply because I have never had one before o)

Have a read here and see what you think:

You are welcome ... I am enjoying the class and can't wait to see how
they finish it .. the Berserker has no defining class AAs as yet and
Sony will be adding them within six months.  In some ways this is good
unless you have a power levelled character who is stuck with the
current abilities.

It will be interesting to see how the game play changes with these AAs.

On a personal note my Berserker appears to put out more damage than my
Pally but log parsers do not show the full story atm (none take care of
the Frenzy ability)  I hope Yalp put out a patch soon so I can do some
real testing.
