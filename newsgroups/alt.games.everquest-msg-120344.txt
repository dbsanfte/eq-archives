I agree, the non poofing key seemed very like a fix to make an otherwise
wasted zone more popular.  Now I wish we'd taken advantage of it, since
we were sure this was an intentional change we weren't in any rush to
cancel scheduled raids and do this instead, just put it in at the end of the
calender, and asked people to make a point of going on pickup Air raids
in the mean time so there wouldn't be any key issues.
