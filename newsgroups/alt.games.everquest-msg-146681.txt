Hmmm, I would think that "a Christian web site discussing the Wiccan
rede" ought to merit being taken seriously.  OTOH, judging solely by
what Taras quoted, this particular site would appear to merit nothing
but derision.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that what Taras
quoted constitutes a clear violation of the 9th Commandment.  That is,
I can see no qualitative difference between the writer's absurd mis-
characterization of "An it harm none..." and any other "false witness"
he or she might bear against a "neighbor".  Sadly, so far as I can
tell this sort of bullshit is not at all uncommon.
