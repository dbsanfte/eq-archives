You don't piss and moan about how you're suffering when your dashboard
squeaks, do you?

It's a part of the game. You take one part, you get all the other
parts.

Need I define "most of the time"? F9 is still restricted somewhat. You
cannot use it to see more than minimally around corners...

No, but when you read a book IRL, you aren't totally focused on the
letters on the page, are you? If it is a particularly good book, how
quick are you to notice when someone walks up to you? Most people
won't notice until that person makes a sound or touches them to get
their attention. The degree of immersion in meditation is far greater.
