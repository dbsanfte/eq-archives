You made me think of an interesting point, Biz... there was no temporary
truce or agreement made to suspend the guild war for the wedding, and no
'sanctuary' zones or events were declaired as a part of the war
agreement.... therefore, nothing was violated as far as guild wars go by
attacking during the wedding.

The leadership of the Dwarf guild was not thinking properly in planning
either for the war nor for the wedding.  It's their fault something went
awry, by leaving themselves open to attack at such an event.  Makes me
suspect that a sizeable portion of the guild may not have even known they
were at war.

It shows just how totally mentally unprepared for war the Dwarf guild was,
and it sounds like absolutely none of them has had a single ounce of PvP
experience prior to this.

In my opinion, jd should garner the attention of the Realm of Heros for his
act....not to the level of being immortalized, but at least a minor goodie
from the Realm of Mischief might be in order... :-)
