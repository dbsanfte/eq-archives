It's all a matter of perspective.  From my perspective, with a 60 melee and
a 60 caster under my belt, I could step into *any* character and within 1/2
hour be able to play it respectably.  Again from my perspective, as a raid
leader, I know what I ask each class to do on raids, and so I know what
would be asked of me if I were to be playing that class.

I didn't say "good" there, just respectably.  I'd get the basics done and
wouldn't wipe a raid, but if it came down to me single-handedly saving a
raid it probably wouldn't happen on a class I just jumped into.

For this to even appeal to me, it would have to result in a 50+ character. 
I mean, seriously, I can have any character up to 50+ in a week fairly
easily if I want to, in a day if I want to devote the time and effort to it.
