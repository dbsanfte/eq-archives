I think EQ1 is too much overgrown to start playing it. Too many uber
players are around.
The biggest blow in EQ1 were teleporting books. One of most thrilling
part of the game - exploring -
was reaped off in one day.
I played EQ1 from time when 55 was max level.  Then sony started to add
new levels(60,65).
And I realized that I will be always about high middle if they continue
add new levels.
I finished playing with 46 level character and waited for EQ2.
Now I am enjoying it.
