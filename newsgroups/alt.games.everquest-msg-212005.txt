Please shut up now, I'm really starting to get embarrassed on your
behalf.  Apart from the obvious fact that only having to heal one
person is much more efficient than having to throw heals left right
and centre did it even cross your tiny n00b mind that SKs and
Paladins can, erm, heal themselves?

Case in point: Paladin friend of mind got bored sitting in PoI and
pulled one of the yard trash mobs and straight up melee-d it to death
unslowed.  Didn't bother rooting or stunning it just dropped heals on
himself and went back to meleeing just to prove it could be done.
