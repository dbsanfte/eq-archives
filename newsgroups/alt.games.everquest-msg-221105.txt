Hadn't thought about them, but a possibility.  Ideally they'd be coded a bit
nastier to undead than a necro would be.  Necros should get higher aggro
from live than from undead (live critters have more to lose).

Admitted I wouldn't want to break Paladins (after all, my main is a
Paladin).  But changing things so that Paladins are more desired against
undead, while Warriors are more desired against living opponents doesn't
seem to me to be much of a "break".


One thing I really liked about AD&D 2 was that Clerics were slightly better
against undead than Paladins were, and Paladins were better against
hellspawn than anybody.  (A close check of the rules showed that Turn Undead
worked against undead for Clerics, but against Undead *and* demons/devils
for Paladins.)

Warriors versus the living
Clerics versus the undead
Paladins versus Evil.
