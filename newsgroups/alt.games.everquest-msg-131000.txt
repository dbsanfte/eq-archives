Yep.  Their script heuristics and parsing are crap.  If the guides weren't online somewhere,
I simply wouldn't be interested in doing them AT ALL.  I have one character that's currently
working on the Iksar shackle of rock quest.  Whoever figured this quest out is
a genius, or at least someone with a ton of patience and time to play.  As it is, even
knowing all the steps, it's pretty hard to complete.  And the result is an AC4 bracer.
No stats.  And kinda heavy.  Yay.  But it's necessary to get the better bracers and
even the whistling fists weapon eventually if I have the patience.

Some of the higher level quests are so much easier, like, for example, lambent bracers.
Basically, get one hard to obtain item, and buy some other stuff.  Turn them into the right
NPC's and boom, nice item.  Shackle of Rock requires getting many hard to obtain items in
about 6 zones with camping required on five of them (4 fingers, left fist, sash of young ronin,
sparring gloves, jawbone).  And it's especially difficult to do on a PvP server where some
of the zones are primarily havens for players from other teams.
