Sure it happened, but the perceived need was not *nearly* as great as 
with KEI. SoW runs don't happen any less frequently now than they did 
then. Why would they? Nothing has changed in that regard. If you felt the 
need to have the ability for quick flight from a fight before engaging a 
mob, nothing has alleviated that. Now you just have to put up with KEI 
runs as well.

Yup. Still got those people as well, though now far few folks are willing 
to part with their pp with PoK books everywhere.

Not a lot, yet your implication there is that being a "port whore" is 
also a bad thing. Now we just get to deal with more types of whores.

You would have to be extremely short sighted not to realize that with KEI 
casters can nuke far more often of each mob than without it. That makes 
each mob fall faster and more easily. Often no teamwork is required, 
everyone just nukes, nukes and nukes again until it's dead.

Diablo didn't have much downtime either. It was also one of the most 
mind-numbing games I have played. Click, click and more clicks.

No one likes downtime, just like no one likes to have to work for their 
money. I would much rather just get a check in the mail every month for 
doing nothing, but what if everyone else did too? Do you think that money 
would be worth nearly what it is now? Nope. Neither is the resulting EQ 
after all the effort is gradually removed.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.
