I was having much the same problem when I started playing SWG. I ever had a
problem with EQ, although I don't have all the ezpansions you have (Vellious
and LOY are all I have). I also haven't ventured out of the confines of the
original game either. But when I atarted playing SWG it was excruciating how
slow it was. Sometimes I felt fortunate if I could take 4 steps before the
screen froze. I have a similar system to yours, only my vid card is a Radeon
9000. But today I went from 256mb of RAM to a full gig. Bo problems now. The
reason I knew that was the problem was that my hard drive light would
eventially stay on full time. That meant the RAM was full and it was using
virtual memory to take up the slack. Too much for the poor Athlon. I don't
know that going from 768 to 1 gig will help that much, but it's pretty easy
to do. I probably paid way too much for mine ($165 for two 512 chips), but
you'd only have to buy one and no one complains about having *too much* RAM.
Just a thought,

Curtis
