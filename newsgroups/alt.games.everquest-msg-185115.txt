I use a GeForce 4 ti 4200 with 128MB of DDR.  It works absolutely awesome 
for eq.  Only times I have major slowdowns are the Bazaar (bit surprise), 
and big raids, in which case, turning off all the effects, sky, player 
names, makes it respond quite nicely.  This is running with a P3-800 and 
768MB of 133MHz, so, far from top end on the motherboard.
