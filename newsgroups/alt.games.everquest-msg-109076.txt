>>> I'm playing a DE Necro, and I am in Northern Ro and the East Commons,
 usually...  I can trade with Merchants in the Inns (and have done for
 some time) but only the "main" merchant - the two who stand in the
 wings or annexes of the buildings still won't trade with me  :( <<<

This will be of no help to you, but I think it's interesting ....

My Gnome Necro can trade with the two merchants in the wings, but not with
the main merchant.

Weird.
