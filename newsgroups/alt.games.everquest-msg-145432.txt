That'd be the necro channel, dear.  IE, the other day they were 
discussing that thing awhile back where some tribe caught 2 kids hanging 
out together who were not from the same side of the tracks, so to speak, 
and raped the kid's sister or something.  Many, many jokes flying about 
whether she was hot or not. ><  It's fairly typical of the type of talk 
going on in there.  I took that channel off my autojoin list, if I want 
help with my necro, I'll /ooc the question in the bazaar or log off and 
find it myself.
