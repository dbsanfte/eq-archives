That is exactly the case. No class has received as many huge improvements
as rogues. The only class that has been nerfed less than rogues are
warriors...and rogues only because of the evade "nerf" (which really didn't
hurt them at all). Warriors of course, have not ever received a single nerf
in the history of the game.
