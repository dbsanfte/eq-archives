Absolutely!  I'm just a handful of kills away from level 45 with my
Ranger, still beating on dark-blue Large Zelniaks in Dawnshroud Peaks.
 If they stay DB, I'll stay there until reaching 46 -- when
Swarmcaller starts to proc!  Then, I don't know.  I've been told to
try the City of Mist entryway, or possibly the Dreadlands.

But I've pretty much soloed my entire career, with one successful (my
first and only) LDoN adventure and a few quick pick-up groups in Maris
Seru back in the 30's.

As you get more Root and Snare spells, soloing becomes easier.  ALWAYS
Snare your target, since they are locked in place when they try to
Death-March away at 20% health or so.  It saves you chasing them and
possibly getting adds.

Enjoy!  I love my Ranger.  Between tracking and being a blender with
Dual Wield and Double Attack, it's been a fun ride so far.

Take it and run.
