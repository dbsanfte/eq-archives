For those thinking of upgrading their machines for the release of SoL,
here's an applicable question posed to Brad, and his answer. May be of
value to you. (...or not, of course.)

Question: For SOL, Would it be better for me to upgrade (see the
following):

My 128 RD-RAM to 256 RD-RAM
Or
My Geforce2 32meg(RD)4xAGP to Geforce3(yada,yada)
Or
My PIII 866 to PIII 1.0?

Answer: Well, you've got a pretty nice machine there already, and it's
definitely above min spec. If you still plan on upgrading, though, I'd
think the additional RAM would help the most - more RAM means less
swapping and better load times. After that, more CPU is always good. As
for a Geforce 3, we're not doing much that would give it a significant
advantage over a Geforce 2.
