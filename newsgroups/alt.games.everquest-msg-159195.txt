You'll see clerics that swear by it, though.  Crunch the numbers and Heroism turns out
to be a better heal... unless your group has Aego or heroism from a higher level
cleric.  I used Remedy where many would use DL, cause its better at stopping most
forms of death that preclude CH.. just because its faster.  I used ER and Remedy
concurrently from 58 on, but now I have only SR memmed, freeing up a valuable spell
slot; I learned that when I was casting a fast heal I no longer care at all how much
it costs, with the damage mobs are laying out in PoP, I need fast AND large heal.

Compare your warrior buddy HP to that of some summoned pets, or worse of charmed pets,
and you may get a surprise.

I ran a cleric from 1 to 49, then started over on another server and ran one to 61 so
far, never got much twinking or PLing on either character, and even the highest level
guild I've been in (the one I'm currently in) couldn't really be called uber, only
some of the tanks in it are beginning to pass 1250.  I'm not saying 30 AC don't matter
over 1250, I'm saying that it matters very little at 1000.  Or at 700.  Or heck,
almost any time.

Try this yourself.  Go find a nice dark blue mob you can pull to a safe spot.  Root
it.  Go in and let it hit you for a while.  Back out.  AC buff yourself.  Go back in
and let it hit you a while.  Don't die, but get a nice long log to compare.

AC in small amounts doesn't matter much in the best circumstances.

But wait, I said "the best circumstances"... take off all your armor and go try the
experiment again.  I'll bet you find NO difference at all in how much you get hit
for.  Now drop that mob and go find a nice green one.  Put all your armor on.  Repeat
the experiment again.  Once more, I'll wager you find no difference at all between
buffed and unbuffed.  AC matters only over a narrow range on a per mob basis; in that
range you will see some effect from adding AC, but below that range, you'll still take
max damage no matter how far below you are, and above that range you'll still take
minimum damage no matter how far above you are.  These are "not the best
circumstances."  Usually your MT will be above mob target range, and the other people
you care about, enchanters, will be below the target range, and there's nothign much
your AC buff will do for either, beyond making them feel all fuzzy and warm inside.

I've heard its been changed, or perhaps that it works now with the resist changes.
How it used to work was 75% of the time it would be resisted, and almost every time it
was resisted, the target and all the mobs nearby would come running.  Very little use
for a "lull" with that low a chance of even splitting a single pair.  If it works 75%
of the time, or if mobs stopped attacking most of the time on resist, then it would be
useful.  I've got 110 levels of "thats a useless line" behind me though, will be hard
to learn a new trick like that.

Memming DB means a lot more freedom to use it as a tool, since you won't be throwing
away DA ability.  It also effectively cuts your refresh time in half, if you use DB,
then a bit later are forced to use DA, you have less than the full 18 minute wait
before DB pops up.

Yep, the "root and atone" trick is a package deal, more powerful than either memmed by
itself.

Well, its kind of a DS, and it stacks with all other DS except another cleric casting
the same line.  15 points isnt' a whole lot, but it does add up, and you can get a
mage putting a 33 point DS on the tank, who can have a DS of his own, plus this, for
around 100 points every time the mob hits the target.

On the other hand, its a pain in that you need to put it on every mob, while a DS
works on the victim instead, against every mob that hits him.  DS works just as well
in camping short lived mobs with a fast pull rate as it does on slower kill slower
pull mobs.  MoR works only on the mob, so in a fast kills situation, its a waste; the
mobs die before you get your mana's worth.  Its also works best with mobs that do a
lot of hitting; with a slower in your group, your MoR loses some of its effect, since
the mob hits less often.  If you can find mobs that hit for very little, but fast fast
fast, then you get maximal effect out of MoR.

Well, the warriors won't do damage all that fast... but the shaman will slow the mob
so it won't be doing as much hitting as it might.  Probably not worthwhile with mobs
only living a minute and being slowed.

A far more important spell is Mark of Karn.  Not that the tiny heal it provides is all
that important to most people.. but it uses the same slot that mobs use for their
damage shields, and overwrites them.  Usually you will see people casting dispell
magic line on mobs to kill a DS, this is using a sledgehammer to kill a housefly; it
also removes useful debuffs that people are casting on the mob!  MoK goes in and takes
out your DS target like a precision munition targetted on an Iraqi Scud.
