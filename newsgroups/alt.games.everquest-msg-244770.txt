Yes, item links are links to *items* only, and in the case of spells that
means the scrolls. I bet I'm one of the few players in the game (if not the
only one) who was careful to do a t; to both "Balance of the Nihil" and
"Daluda's Mending" (2 new GoD SHM spells), and writing down the item codes
before happily scribing them into my scrollbook after looting them. ;-)
