So, trying to get to max ally faction with True Spirit, I'm
wondering a couple things.

1) what, precisely, are the various point levels of the various
faction levels in the game.  I presume all factions are the
same.  So if we start at zero faction for max KOS and run up to
what, 4000 for max ally... what are the waypoints in the course?

2) how many points does each of the various shaman epic quest
parts generate?  I've assumed that the further along in the
quest, the higher the boost, but that could easily be wrong.  The
hardest part I've done so far was Black Dire... logic might
suggest it would be the biggest boost but I dont think I'd do it
again even if it was.  However, it would be easy indeed to do the
Woe and Envy part repeatedly... heck, bring a friend along to
carry spares and I could do it several times in one go!  At the
moment I'm doing the pages as thats good soloing, and books as
people kill Ghiosk for sport and let me loot them

3) how about other quests and kills?  Is there a resource out
there listing the amount of faction hit for various actions?  I
know, for example, that killing coldain and wolves in GD seems to
generate exceedingly small negative faction hits with them, I did
several levels of killing them and didn't drop past dubious.
Similarly, killing giants in GD does little good, killing frost
giants in KD does more, killing storm giants still better, so on
and so forth.  Has anyone actually broken out exactly how much
relative to each other these things do, other than just by feel?
