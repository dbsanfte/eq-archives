Snip>Neither said anything, I just sorta felt like the odd one out.

My daughter plays a druid and she feels the same way sometimes.  In this
situation they seemed to have things well in control, but you never know
what might happen....

My daughter was feeling pretty useless one day while we were fighting Ice
Giants because we had a healer in the group (wasn't needed for healing), we
had a wizard in the group (not needed for nuking) and two tanks and a rogue
(not needed for melee).  Well, the rogue (me) went LD at just about the time
the group pulled a big baddie.  They lost the main tank, but my daughter
evacuated the rest of the group before anyone else went down.  Yeah! Druids.
