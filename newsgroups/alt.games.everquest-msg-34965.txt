You don't list your race, class, or religion, so its hard to say what your
faction is with -anything-

There are two Guks, upper and lower.  The one you get two from the swamp
is peopled with live frogloks, and most races start non KOS to them.  There
is a -large- faction hit for killing even one, though.  Having been KOS to them
with a past character, my current main will stand there and let you die rather
than lift a finger to help kill a live froglok if a zone line isn't nearby.
Heck, I
can always res you after!  Not only will live frogloks attack anyone who
is KOS, but they will do so -long- after they become green cons.  Nothing
more annoying to me than being beset by swarms of greenies, so that even
if I kill them in droves, I'm not getting exp for doing it.

At any rate, you can wander safely around most of UGuk, at least the frogs,
spiders, and crocodiles won't attack you.  There are some other mobs
in there that aren't on that faction, so eyes open, and con anything different
before you get close.

Lower Guk has a few live frogloks, but a lot of dead ones... the undead
are KOS, and killing them gives a little positive faction with the live ones.
Unfortunately, it seems to take a -lot- of dead froggies to make up for
killing one live one.  IVU will get you thru most of the zone if you are good
with Live frogloks, but just past the bedroom there is a spot with mixed
bats and dead frogs... The bats see invis, even thru rogue hide&sneak

Dunno how you raise faction with them, or what various race/religion combos
might start non-KOS.  Bards and chanters can raise faction with most
intelligent races on norrath with a song or spell, so that would be one way
to wander the zone... but that doesn't work as well if there is more than
one faction there.

Anywhere in Norrath, killing merchants is useless.  You never get exp or loot,
and they tend to be underconned.  Only reason to do it would be in limited
circumstances where you need them cleared out of the way for some reason.
