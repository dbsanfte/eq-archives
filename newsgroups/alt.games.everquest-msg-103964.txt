I can top that.  I was at the WL zone in Kael with a corpse, and
a 56+ Cleric was sitting there naked not five feet from my corpse.

I asked him if I could buy a rez, and he said, "sorry, I'm
going to be rezzed myself soon".

I just said, "ok, thanks anyway", but what I really wanted to say
was, "so what the hell *else* were you planning on doing with
that full mana bar before it all vanishes when the rez comes in?"
