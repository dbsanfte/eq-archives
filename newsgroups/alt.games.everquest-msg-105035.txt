I noticed that my 29 druid is not so hot at divination as she is with other
skills. Scanning my log I see (only) invis and see invis type spells as
increasing it. Can someone confirm that that is the case and, if so, is it
just a simple matter of taking some time out for some repetitive casting of
them? Will that work or is there a wis/int/char/etc. improvement that will
help or is it worth improving it anyway? It's at 48 at present and
everything else seems to be up in the 140/150s
