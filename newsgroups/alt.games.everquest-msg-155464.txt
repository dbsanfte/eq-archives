I've had my own batch of weirdoes. One would propose marriage every
time he saw me for 6 levels. 
Another took "lonely 29 druid seeking company" as a plea for friends
rather than a twist on /lfg, couldn't understand why I never roleplay
deeper feelings, proposed to me, ended up getting EQ married (and then
divorced) to someone else, complained when I wasn't being enough
'close friends' for his tastes, went around on sept 11 claiming he'd
lost an arm and a leg to draw attention... (and I used to know weirder
guys when I was into telnet chats! they never figure out why they
never really get to know anything about me)
The first time I played, a halfling druid was being kind of lewd
around my level 13 patchwork clad self. I made him stop, he started
behaving well, and he later gave me a plat ruby veil and a plat star
ruby veil, as gifts for  the beautiful lady. /sigh (but I took the
veils, mwuahah).
I've received gifts from other players several times, but almost
always from females and mostly from someone just giving away old gear
to random_newb453463. My girls don't have a tendency to develop
hormone catching personalities :) (Ok, my mage is the Happy happy joy
joy type, but she's only 12, and I am not sure what the 9 pally is
yet. Every single one of the others has some measure of haughty bitch
goddess in them *eg*)

/ponders introducing meem to Zavijah Iceheart, DE SK, to make him stop
complaining about how Cel treats him :p

Anyway, I've also received my share of comments during CRs and during
the naked Luclin model phases... woofie form is usually nice for that,
except one ogre who also fancied dogs - welcome to my permanent
shitlist.
