  Ah, I've been trounced by your impenetrable logic.  I'll have to see if
local debate teams are up on the "nuh-uh" tactic.  Descartes will probably
nerf it when he hears about it though, the bastard.

  And there was the point you missed.  People who (willingly, informed of
the situation) go to the RvR area, assuming they're adequately organized, do
not *always* lose.  The people who play, and continue to have fun (despite
your arguments that this is impossible) are those who do not mind losing
sometimes, because it's at least fun enough when they *do* win to balance
out.
