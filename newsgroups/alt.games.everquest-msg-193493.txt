It says a NVIDIA GeForce4 MX card so I assume it is a AGP slot. I
could go a little better on the graphics card for some more cash.... I
think the Raedon 9700 adds like $200 to the price. But I'm using a
GfForce4 MX 420 right now that does a good job... Thanks for the info
though I'll have to take that into consideration.

One thing, right now Dell is promoting the 3.06 GHz CPU with a $200
rebate so that makes this machine the same price at a 2.66 GHz machine
with equal characteristics.
