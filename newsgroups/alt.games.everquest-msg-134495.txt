Just me... but doen't it take a bigger man/woman to say

'Hey.. I'm not sure about something... could you give me your opinion on it'
and be wrong and find out the right answer?' and had thier answerer

or someone to say 'Hey your a dumbass for asking a question' and the flame
and 'prove' how much 'better' they are...

Personally I'll ask questions if it has a chance of pointing me in the right
direction... even IF it proves me wrong... stupid ppl do the same things
over and over and expect different results... smart ppl learn from
mistakes/misinformation and move on...

just my 2 cents
