But even so, when people talk about the time sink in skilling to 250 - that
just shows its bs.  I spoke to various people before she started her
brewing, they all said "it took xxx weeks to get 248" (average being about 4
weeks).. she did it in 2 days

Took her <2 days to get 200

hehe poor her.  her tailoring is only 36.. wonder if she knows what shes
lettin herself in for

Which is stuff a handful of people can do (read 3)

I did the princess house in SG before (bunch of high level clerics and
enchanters) with my monk/my shaman, a cleric, a friend monk.  Make that more
balanced (add a chanter in, drop a monk for a warrior etc) and you have a
trivial "camp".   I do fully understand the joke that is trade skills, but
somebody earlier said the 8th shawl was "an uber guild thing"..   lots of
pointless trade skills + camps is about the furthest from making it an uber
guild thing, as they possibly could

as for my skilling.. well ive already said how retarded they are... pottery
122, smithing 38.  I dont expect either to change anytime soon either
