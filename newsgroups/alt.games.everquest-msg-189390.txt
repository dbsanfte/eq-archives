    From what I remember, it was two clerics and a monk main tank with
support, top-end gear. They had one close call which required someone to be
ressed back in, but other than that it was smooth sailing.

    You'd be surprised what can be one-grouped. For example, remember that
mob in the Carprin cycle that spawns all the skeletons if someone dies? It
can wipe out a 47 person raid quite quickly, but once they give up and
leave, three clerics and three necromancers can move in....
