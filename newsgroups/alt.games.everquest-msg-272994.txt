Hard to say. In a "roleplaying" game one would expect to recruit a party 
in the local bar (ie a gathering place for adventurers betweem 
expeditions)... but since nobody hangs out in the local bar the 
roleplayer is already reduced to behaving like an idiot... (ie running 
around in the forest at night yelling "Hi I'm looking for a party to 
join! Hello? Helllooooo?") Its a no win situation :)
