DL seems to be most popular on the "north wall" (of karnors).

Personally, I hate crowds and when I hunted in DL I did it near the FV zone
line.  A full, rounded group of even LOW 30s should be able to survive
there.  Hmmm, well, mid-30s anyway. :)  You'll have to avoid dog ragers, MG
Steeps...maybe spider recluse and widows as well (but spiders are pretty
easy regardless, so dunno).
