Though I do think a business should pay attention to their customers it
must not be without questioning the consumers ideas. Let's exaggerate a
bit here. Assume you play chess and always play white. The rules say a
pawn is weaker than any other piece on the board and only can move
forward. You may find yourself where you wish you could move the pawn
one step back but the rules prohibit that. So you complain about this
rule at the manufacturer. If they get alot of complaints and the majority
stems from players exclusivly playing white they might figure there is a
slight disadvantage for white pieces. So they allow white pawns to step
backwards to compensate for that.

Surely black is set up to loose then. So they complain in return and so on
and on.

Sure I know that chess is perfectly balanced as white and black command
the same pieces with same limitations. It was just to emphasize my
point. And this point is there are rules for any game. And how to
advance whithin these rules is up to the player. And one way to become
better at any game is understanding these rules. You could complain
about some nearly impossible to beat obstacles or you could try to fight
them.

If the company is going to change the rules do you think this
truly will benefit the game? I don't. Especially as these proposed
changes often are just tailored for one single occasion.

So no, I don't think a company should provide everything the customer
asks just because he is a customer. They should listen. If they deem it
ok they will implement it! Otherwise they must not.
