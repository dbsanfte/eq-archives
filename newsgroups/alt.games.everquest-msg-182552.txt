Wizards aren't about sustained DPS.  They're about "KILL IT NOW."  In that
respect, they're pretty damn powerful in all three aspects (soloing,
grouping, and raiding).  I've seen a wizard five levels below me clear out
the Plaguebone Thieves in DL, when my Paladin can barely keep two spawns
clear.  There is absolutely nothing gimp about Wizards.
