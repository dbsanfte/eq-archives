I'm going on my first Hate raid tonight.  I'll never see Vex Thal.  I'll 
never roam NToV.  I'll probably never see an epic in the hands of my 
chanter.

Whatever you do, don't -ever- stop writing your normal posts.  I don't care 
if you quite the game; make shit up.  It gives we that will never be there 
a glimpse of what it is like, and we appreciate it.
