The biggest difference between the 2 is faction. Gnome Necros are MUCH
less hated throughout the old world than the Erudites. Erudites are
KoS to most of Qeynos, until they kill a lot of Gnolls for example.

The next biggest difference is night vision. Gnomes have inate
Infravision, and Hum/Eru have to wait until level 8 when they get the
spell Deadeye.

I can't think of any other "big" differences. As a pet class all of
the Necro race choices are good. (Even Humans)
