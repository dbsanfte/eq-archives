I've gone the situation in South Karana where I'd occasionally be in
groups with 3 other druids to Overthere, where there was a marked
shortage of healers of all kinds last night and I got two offers for
groups within a minute of shouting for one - at level 30, where a lot
of stuff is too high for me to even snare. At one point, there were 3
clerics, 3 druids and 2 shamans in the entire zone (not counting /anon
people).

I also had a discussion with the 52 cleric who gave me a rez about the
difficulty of getting groups around his level, and he said he was
having problems since a group only ever needed *one* cleric, not two.
