Oh come on, the OP asked for more information about RTS games and made it
clear they weren't familiar with WC or AOE, so I elaborated for the benefit
of someone who doesn't understand what an RTS is. I made it clear that
although I found the game "moderately fun", I wasn't commenting positively
on the gameplay, the AI or the potential longevity of the title.

To suggest that I was paid by SOE (yeah I know it was in jest, but still) is
overstating things, don't ya think?

For the record, I spent some time playing this game earlier tonight and I
can tell you with confidence: don't buy this unless you have a serious
jonesing for EQ in an RTS, or if you just want the EQ2 Beta invite. A few
observations:

1) If you want to play a skirmish against the computer, you would probably
look in the Single Player menu and choose Battlemap. You would be wrong,
that option is only for custom maps made by the mod community that has yet
to materialize. No, in order to play a single player skirmish vs the
computer, you have to go to the Multiplayer menu, choose the LAN option,
then click on your opponent to turn him into a Computer player. Of course,
this means that you can't save or pause your game since you're playing a
multiplayer game. Those features are only available if you choose one of the
Campaigns. /boggle.

2) The AI stinks. If you approach, say, a pack of gnolls and stand near one,
it will aggro and come toward you. At that point you can sic your Lord
against this one unit and not worry at all about the other units all
standing nearby, apparently oblivious to one of their kind being slaughtered
in front of them. If you accidentally step into aggro range of the others
and they charge you, no problem. Just step back a few steps and they'll run
back to where they were standing, apparently forgetting that you're fighting
in front of their faces. Imagine if EQ worked that way.

3) I went online to SOEGames.net, the new online matchmaking service for
playing online LoE. There was no one in the lobby, and apparently no games
being played. So I left. I tried it again later with the same result. This
is exactly what happened on the first day that I brought the title home, on
Day One, which is kind of surprising for the launch of a major title. Well,
I was curious about this and visited the forums and the response from the
forum moderator was that the service doesn't give any indication of games
actually being played. It only shows games waiting for players and then
promptly removes them from the display once started. The impression created
is that SOEGames.net is a ghost town and no one is home. The forums had
messages to this effect from players disappointed that no one is playing
this new game. The designer who came up with this idea needs to be awarded a
plaque or something in recognition of their contribution to the cause of
Engineering Efficiency, and then promptly FIRED for one of the dumbest ideas
in the history of computer gaming. They are consciously hiding the fact that
people are playing their game. Brilliant marketing!

Too bad, it is a gorgeous looking game and it's FUN to have a Lord that is a
Barbarian Shaman who carries a spear, slows enemies and buffs allies. It's
fun to wander into a pack of gnolls, assess the situation, opt to take out
the soothsayer before hitting the warriors and then find cool items of loot
on the corpses after the battle, like regeneration charms, etc. My Shaman
casts Spirit of Bih'Li and my blackguards backstab! My Elemental Masters
cast Eye of Zomm and can Evac if we're in trouble. And then to hear that
trademark Ding when one of your guys levels, there's a rush for any EQ
player. It *could* have been a great game...

Except it's not.
