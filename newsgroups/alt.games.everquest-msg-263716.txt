True, it does work well in this case in economical terms.  

I guess I view the bazaar, consignment merchants etc. as the equivalent of 
a Wal-Mart moving into the game.  No need to shop around
(quest/kill/group/raid/search/etc.) for an item, it's usually just sitting 
right there in one place for you to saunter over, buy and walk out.  No 
muss, no fuss.  Easy/simple yes, gameplay value excitement, none.  At least 
to me. :)
