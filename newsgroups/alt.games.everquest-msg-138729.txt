Hi all,

I have actually installed EverQuest + Kunark + Luclin and I will finally get
Scars of Velious tomorrow.

Is there something special about installing Velious after Luclin since
Luclin upgrades Velious graphics too ?
I'm thinking about installing Velious then reinstalling Luclin with Velious
options checked only.

Is it better to uninstall everything and make a fresh install, and if so,
what are the files to save to not have to configure again the UI for my
characters ?

TIA,
