Almost no bears, wolves, cats, etc. have faction hits.  Notable exception 
is the bears of surefall glade.  Don't kill bears in surefall glade if you 
like hanging out there.  In general, though, you're perfectly free to kill 
bears with no ill consequences other than your own guilty feelings.  Just 
tell yourself you are culling the sick and infirm from the herd. :)  And 
if you see one actually -give- you a faction hit, take that into 
consideration and try to figure out why that one is special and whether 
you care.

But 99% of them won't give you a faction hit.  Hmm, other exceptions:  The 
tiny bear pet of the druid by the druid ring in North Karana.  The bear 
hanging out next to Kithicor in Kithicor Forest.  In general, if its name 
isn't a(n)_optionaladjective_bear, cub, or kodiak, it might be worth 
thinking twice about it.
