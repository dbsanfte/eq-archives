The easiest thing to do is to prefix all your out-of-character
communication with 'OOC:' or something.  I'm not sure what conventions
are normally used for this on FV, though.  On "regular" servers people
usually mix in- and out-of-character chat wildly, in my experience,
with no explicit indication of which is which.

To emote things that don't have a predefined emote command, you do
"/emote gyrates wildly", and people will see "Someone gyrates wildly".
