Yeah because they're already dying quite a bit.
A lot of these mobs rampage, that means they will hit the top 8 or so
players on their aggro list.  There's a greater chance a monk is gonna
be up in that list.

Monks don't have a lot of hitpoints to start with.  A couple of
rampages and ripostes and suddenly the monk is at 2 bubbles of health.
With the modified hate list on mobs, at 2 bubbles of health, they go
to number 1 on the hate list.  Dead monk.

Will a 10% increase in damage make the monk go to the top of the hate
list?  Probably not.

Will it make him in the top 8 or so?  More than likely since he's
outdamaging other warriors (remember these other warriors aren't
taunting since they are probably not main tanks at this point) so he
gets rampaged.

Ummm, I see...let's let a monk loot this uber 12/18 1HB weapon and
help him get his epics so he NOT use them against big obscenely high
hitpoint mobs.

The point is that monk damage output wasn't the problem.  It's the
aggro management that's broken.

Give monks a way to reduce their aggro while still sustaining high
damage output and you've "fixed" the monk class for the most part.
