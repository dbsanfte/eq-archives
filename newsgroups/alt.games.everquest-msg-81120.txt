If I remember correctly the common goblin mobs are low-mid 20s and
maybe a few in the low 30s. Caster mobs will eat you alive if you
don't have good resists, and you pull a train. As a monk you can just
mow through them and FD if too many take an interest in you. It's a
lot like SolA only colder :)

>2 whats the highest normal mob in there?
Check www.eqatlas.com it should link to a beastiary list.

>3. highest named mob? other then vox
See number 2 above

>4. where on the eqatlas map are the dire wolf pens
See number 2 above

>5. im looking for perma crystals anyone have any locs?
The crystals seem to be a semi-common drop off of any of the goblins
