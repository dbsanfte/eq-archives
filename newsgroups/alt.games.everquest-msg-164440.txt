Ogreville, Feerrot. Spiderligns galore in the newbie area.. advantage of
this palce is the larger jungle spiders also drop spiderling silk.

In Field of Bone their is a little underground set of tunnels and rooms
called Bonebinder Warrens (on EQ Atlas map). three/four rooms with 4-5
spawns in there plus they run about outside.

Check vendors in Feerot as the Ogre newbies sell them there.
