In Old world - be sure to check out The evil eyes in King Xorb's Maze. 
I think the sphinxes are gone in Rathe Mountains, but they were cool. 
Qeynos Sewers - find Q'bert.  Rivervale - just for the silly halfling
music & the scarecrow.  Runnyeye - see if you can use the goblin
banker.  Alleosaur in OOT.  Kithcore at night ;). Ak'anon, hire a
guide.  Unrest, just hang near the zone and stop a train, you'll
probably see all the mobs in the zone.  Go kill "Emporer" Crush for a
laugh in Crushbone.  Find the hidden cavern in Everfrost, maybe a lich
around that will kill you, but cool zone.

In Luclin Go take a look at the centi's in Maiden's eye, if you are
lucky you can even get by them invis.  Really wierd 4 armed dudes. 
Griegs End.  Really wierd zone - you'll probably die there but worth a
peek or 4.  Mons Letalis - cool bug city, go to the Grey and turn into a
watter elemental, the undead snake people are cool, Paludal & Eccho
Caverns - both awsome XP zones, but cool to look at none the less.  Shar
Val - kitty city, Katta Castellum & Serus Seru - both non agro cities. 

In Kunark check the Burning Woods, the trees are on fire, and there's a
big crater, Chardok is a cool zone as well, you can run around invis a
little, some of the scaled wolves see invis though, or you can raise
your faction and run around.  Don't forget to make an Iksar and explore
Cabilis.  Dalnir is neat, and good for grouping at your level.  City of
Mist.  Go to Dreadlands and ask if Gorgonaire is up, you can get a close
look at a dragon without being killed - just don't turn into any
non-humanoid forms like elementals.

Have fun :)
