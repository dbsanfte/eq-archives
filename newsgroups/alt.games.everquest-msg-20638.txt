Because I petition only names that are truly offensive, whereas
other people petition names that merely annoy them for being
allegedly "stupid", or not creative enough for the petitioner,
or out of spite because they didn't like the fact that the
person was begging, etc. etc.  Are we clear now?

No, actually, I have a very low tolerance for people who are
truly "fucking imbeciles".  I am not, however, arrogant enough
to apply that extreme judgement to people who merely choose
a name that I myself find silly -- apparently, however, you
*are* quite willing to apply extremely derogatory judgements to
people whom you know nothing more about than what name they
may have whimsically chosen to use in a game.  I must say,
I find that far more offensive and anti-social behavior
than someone who (gasp) dares to name his character "Vacuum
Cleaner".

>Hanrahan Thornhide, Druid |

Clearly named after Mark Hanrahan, pitcher for the
Iowa State Cyclones.  That spoils the suspension of my
disbelief, I'm sorry, you'll have to change it.


>Rhialto, Enchanter        | Living and Dying in Fennin Ro

Sorry, names stolen from related fantasy works aren't
allowed, and you'll have to pick a new name, since
you've obviously taken the name of Rhialto the Marvelous,
a sorcerer who is the central character in the three
fantasy stories contained in "Tales of the Dying Earth".

Shall I start a character on Fennin Ro so I can petition
it and let the GM's make the final call?


>Parsifal, Bard            |

You didn't think you could get away with misspelling
"Percival", the Knight of King Arthur's Round Table who
found the Holy Grail, did you?

Just like the woman who called the police because boys
would pass by her window whistling dirty songs, one
can always find an excuse to be disgruntled by someone
else's behavior if one is of a mind to.
