No offense, but that's just a silly notion bordering on spiteful.

Aye, but show up four times as often as others and you will then have 
more /rand chances at loot, effectively giving a similar advantage as a 
point system might.

/rand gives no unfair advantage, ever. Sure, that person who shows up for 
one in twenty raids might win something, but what are the odds? What are 
the odds someone who was at all twenty won the roll on several items when 
that part-timer walked away from his one raid with nothing?

In a guild raid situation, I would have to be in favor of some sort of 
merit-based system. However, that kind of system is very time intensive 
and can cause problems as easily as it prevents them if you don't have 
the right person(s) running it.
