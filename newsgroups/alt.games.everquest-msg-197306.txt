Honestly, its just a perception that its the easiest one.  Ok maybe its more
straightforward than the other trials, but that doesnt translate to easier.
I can think of one easier trial, and one of the same difficulty.  Thats 3,
of 5.

But my shaman is severely under-geared.  The rogue I did my trial with (who
ran the cleric bot) is also severely under-geared.  Sure our mains were nice
and hooked up, but ou bots were geared lesser than your average level 61
person (at the time)

That froglok cleric got to 65 in 3? days.

Well slow doesn't increase DPS.  But it reduces damage, thus saving cleric
mana, saving lives etc.
How do you deal with the waves of adds, mez them? Stun them?

My shaman uses Tigers (ae slow) to 1) slow them, 2) occupy them., whilst we
kill each mob in succession.  He probably tanks more than the designates
tank does.  Thus he can directly replace the bard/chanter, he isn't
competing for a DPS spot.

As for the spawn gods.. well thats just the way it goes.  The first time I
ever tanked it (around 5k HP) I got dispelled on the very first mob of the
first wave, but there was no time to rebuff. We just had to make the best of
it (we did ultimataly win).

Another time the cleric went LD on the executioner - we did win (kindof)..
the people who died were the only people who needed a flag (the wizzie and
shaman), ah well :/

I have no sympathy for level 50 dr00ds who expect to pass PoJ trials, sorry.
Heck even tier 1 stuff would likely con red to them.

About 1/6 my guild used a different trial to execution.  Something like 1/4
of the number 1 guild used different trials also.  We also have 3 guilds
with people that passed all 5 trials (to fight 7th hammer.. what a waste of
time that was)
