You don't say what level you are, but assuming you are L9 or above you
could simply go to "orc hill" during a busy time and start tossing
Heals at other folks who are fighting orcs and using your bow to "tag"
orcs (score a hit to get on the hate list and gain faction without
KSing).  You can gain tons of faction hits in a fairly short time
doing this.  I have done this with a human Ranger (Karana) and as I
recall it took only a few hours to get enough faction for the Trueshot
quest.  Also, at L9 to L13 you can try to get in a group in Crushbone
that is pulling/killing orcs at a fairly fast pace (can be lower, but
you won't be killing as many orcs in as short a time).  The Crushbone
orcs are fairly low hp mobs, even for their level, it isn't really hard
to kill a lot of them solo or grouped, and they are prolific so the
Heal/tag technique also works pretty well.
