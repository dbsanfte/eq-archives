MQ is short for MultiQuest.  It is not actually a way of
transferring no drop items per se, but rather of allowing you to
complete quests which involve no drop items.

Here's the basic plan.  Person A has a no drop item.  NPC
requires that item and at least one other item.  Person A hands
in his item, hits give, NPC complains that he wanted more items. 
Person B hands in the remaining item(s), and NPC gives him the
reward and any faction hits.  If person A is grouped with person
B, they split the exp if any off the quest, but that part is
rarely important.

There are several factors to consider here:  

One, both person A and person B must have sufficient faction to
do the quest.  If person A doesn't have good enough faction, the
item he hands in won't count.  If person B doesn't have
sufficient faction, his item(s) won't count, just as if he'd
tried to hand in the complete set.

Two, if the quest involves only one item, then its impossible to
multiquest

Three, some quests involve filling a container with items and
combining to create a new item, then handing that item in.  If
the combined item is the only thing the NPC wants, then see Two)
above

Four, if someone else handed in the other item(s) the NPC wants,
then when person A hands in his item he'll complete the quest and
get the reward, even though that wasn't your intention.

Five, make very sure person A has hit give before you start...
handing in items in the correct order is the key because whoever
hands in Last gets the reward.

Six, some degree of trust is required, since you can't actually
see whether person A is handing in his item(s) when he tells you
he is.  Some NPCs give messages that will help you be sure whats
happening, but many won't, and if things don't work out as
expected, you are really on your own; the opportunity to play con
artist is certainly present.

Some would call MQing cheating, since you haven't earned the
entire reward on your own.  Others, though, would say that this
is an integral part of the Multiplayer nature of the game, and
point out that many quests are specifically designed (via the
combine angle, for example) to prevent it, implying that where
its not prevented, its working as intended.

Sorry its not as brief as you requested... but for me, this -is-
a short post!
