Ok, I've had this spell for 2 orange into 39 now - and have cast it
once.  The one time I cast it was solely to get a feal for how long
the cast time is.

Frankly, it terrifies me....

How do I use this one?  Better yet - when?  

During a typical grind session, I'm in a 3 or 4 person group FAST
pulling blues, so the tanks don't get beat down too much and Superior
Heal works just fine.  Obviously, its not needed there unless I want
to run the tank(s) down over the course of a few pulls, then CHeal
'em(?).  

Is it more mana efficient?

Did I say that long cast time scares me?
