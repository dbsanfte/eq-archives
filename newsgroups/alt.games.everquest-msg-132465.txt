The current lack of consensus of the tradeskill community is that you may be
more likely to get a skill gain on a successful combine than a failed
combine.  Therefore, given that you are more likely to succeed if an item is
almost trivial, you are more likely to get a skill gain.  So, doing it by
the book would be both the cheapest, and most effective way to do this.
That being said, there is no real consensus on this, so your guess is as
good as anyone elses.
