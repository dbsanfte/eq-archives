I forsee the cheap ones being 10k or so and not being all that much
faster than normal running speed. I also see the top of the line
horses costing 50 to 100 k and looking like Pegasi (permanent Levitate
and SoW speed).

And I just know some winer out there is gonna bug Verant to get
ridable Dragons and/or Jousting skill in the game...
