Not only can you change the background color of the windows (most of them
anyway), but you can set the transparency level of the background too.  I
can't even imagine going back to the old tiny view of the world screen, now
that sucked.

One other possibility, what resolution do you have your screen set to, if
it's set to a low resolution, then the new view is probably pretty bad, as
the windows take up too much screen real estate.
