Wal-mart has been known to refuse to carry certain games until changes
were made so that they could be sold on their shelves.

Read "The Games Wal-Mart Doesn't Play" at this link:
http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,55955,00.html

(Gives examples of several famous "Wal-Mart Versions" of games.
Scary.)

In my town, there's a Best Buy across the street from the mall, which
has a Software Etc. and an EB store. The mall stores consistently beat
Best Buy opening day (and week) for new games but Best Buy often has
some sort of advertised special on a game a few weeks after its been
released that's far better than the mall stores.

I think it pays to comparison-shop, myself. I'll certainly drive
across the street to save five dollars.
