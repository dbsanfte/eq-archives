Like I said in my experience people aren't interested. It was hard
enough finding a group for AQ4, one of the more popular quests. For
other lesser quests you often have no chance of finding people. And yes
I was often do the recruiting.

In my experience people only group to grind away certain creatures and
aren't interested in doing specific quests.

I agree but that doesn't mean you should penalise people you want to
solo. I've played online games that have both. Grouping is always
better because it safer and quicker. EQ2 the only game I played that
draws a line down the middle between group and solo content. But the
line is unfairly biased towards groups.

And if SOE don't listen to what its subscribers they will leave for
games that do, ie WOW. Enough people seem to be scream for soloable
content leads me to believe SOE have this issue very wrong.

There are not as many soloable quests as groups ones and when you get
one its impossible to tell which is which. Plus you can get mixtures,
ie start out killing easily creatures but the last bit sends you up
against a named or mob which you have no chance doing.

Or how about unavoidable class quest that make tell you to kill
creatures you can't solo but because you hit a level cap you can't
level past and come back to then they are grey!

And what's there to stop a group doing solo quest? The game doesn't
stop a group killing red/solo creatures and getting exp and item but
stops solo players killing group mobs. Seems very biased an unfair to
me.

You have totally misunderstood me here. I would rather be in a group
then soloing. It safer and quicker but I don't often have much time
during the week. I can only play maybe an hour at a time and if you
spend the first half and hour finding a group that doesn't leave much
time to do anything.
