I also moved from EQ2 back to EQ1, luckily i still find a lot of people to 
play with on my server (AB) in POK i can still do a /w and see over 70 
people in the zone at any one time, EQ2 amazed me with the graphics, but it 
did feel like an awfully lonely place at times and i could spend more than 
an hour sometimes looking for groups, which definetely is not the case on 
EQ1.  I would also like to see the EQ1 world with EQ2 graphics.

I left EQ1 around october last year, so i never got a chance to see the 
dragons of norrath expansion.   When i joined EQ1 again about a week ago i 
went to check out the lavastorm zone to see how much it had changed, the 
graphics are amazing.   It was quite funny zonning into Solusek after about 
10 minutes of running around the zone.   Lol going from the new graphics 
right back to the EQ1 (before any expansions) graphics is quite a shock to 
see.
