I and Dominikus should take most of the blame for that as we incorrectly
spouted off about "winds of the north" being the right evac.

My memory of the evac is more like this...

...you are now in skyfire mountains...
Orlun says "hmmm, skyfire, this looks fun"
Tylana says "oh! look at all the pretty critters"
Jakugg says "ACK!!! WE have to leave NOW!!!!!!"
Orlun says "why, lets look..."
Jakugg interrupts and says "PORT!, help help EVAC,   im scared......
waaaaaaaaaa"
Tylana says "sigh, I suppose we could go..."
anon_druid says "what song shall I play?"
Jakugg says "HURRY!!!!"
/em orlun comforts Jakugg
Tylana says "hang on, dreadlands next stop"
...you are now in the Dreadlands...
Orlun says "that was a neat diversion"
Jakugg says "afk, I have to go to the Bathroom now"
....

Just kidding Jakugg... ;-)
