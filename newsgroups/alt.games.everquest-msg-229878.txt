Right, group they said and I have, a little.  Now I am diving in the 
deep end tomorrow and going on the above as part of a multi-guild raid.

As a L55 druid, what should I know and what am I expected to be doing? 
I'd guess at damage shields and snares/roots and backup heals.

I do not have any special gear, I do have wis at 254 but all other 
resists are merely 40 to 50.  Am I an automatic suicide case :)

Oh and I've tried to find some advice/info on the web and have come up 
with very little - not even a map, although I think that is due to the 
layout of PoI.  Anyone point me at any resources?

Thanks in advance.
