EQ never had 2 million simultaneously active accounts.  Maybe 2 million total,
but the discussion here is active subscriptions.  500k active subscriptions is
the generally accepted level for EQ's peak.

When WoW hit 1 million accounts, every industry person I know said a
collective "holy shit".   And they publicized the hell out of it.  EQ would
have done the same if they had ever gotten close.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
