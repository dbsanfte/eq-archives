There's nothing wrong with access to guns and I never said there
was.  We're talking just about access to full automatic weapons
and Teflon-coated bullets, remember.

If the whole purpose is to provide for the citizen's defense
against an oppressive government, why shouldn't you (and everyone
else, of course) have access to anti-air missiles?  Or claymore
mines?  Or, for that matter, your own thermonuclear device?  After
all, the Constitution says "the right to keep and bear Arms," not
"the right to keep and bear guns."

But I seriously don't expect you to argue the Amendment to its
logical conclusion and argue in favor of individual rights to have
hand-launched anti-air missiles or RPGs in every closet.  Reasonable
people agree there's a place where the public good outweighs the
individual's rights.  So we're talking about a line.

You seem to draw that line at a point where anyone without a prior
record can buy weapons capable of killing hundreds in a short amount
of time, weapons that are designed only to kill people, and ammo
that's designed to shoot through metal barriers including protective
wear worn by law enforcement.  Lots of reasonable people draw that
line on the other side, putting weapons which CAN kill but not quite
so well in the hands of the public for self defense, recreation, and
self-sufficiency, but reserving military weapons for the military.

But, hey, if you're comfortable with the religious right gun-nuts
down the road having a fully-stocked arsenal of military-grade
weapons when some loony kills a kid or two with tracings of "that
evil pagan witchcraft" around, who am I to argue?
