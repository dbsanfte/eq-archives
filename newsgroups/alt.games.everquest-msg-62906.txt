It indicates that you avoided the obviously implied question of why don't
you ask HERE if anyone else is seeing this problem.  Lets diagnose the
evidence.  You claim that you have many users reporting to you (I am
assuming *ALL* implies many).  These users report to you because they feel
you are in a way responsible for their machines since you built and upgraded
them.  This SHOULD imply that you have a certain level of troubleshooting
knowledge that would be sufficient to solve a modem setting problem.  But
yet you come here asking for help and implying that Verant did something.
Do the math.  It dont add up.  If you have problems with YOUR machine, you
would get better help if you came clean and don't start casting aspersions
that are unwarranted.
