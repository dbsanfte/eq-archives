Can you define the specs on Headshot for us? Since I don't follow Ranjah
stuff too closely, I haven't been watching their PoP AA stuff. Does
"pose no challenge" mean green con mobs? If that's the case, I think
there's a whole host of greenies that our Trueshot Ranjahs can already
down with one arrow.
