I've got a level 4 shadowknight and I met a necromancer (level 5) who was
practically begging me to fight his pet.  I wasn't interested but he still
kept asking.
I usually give people the benefit of a doubt but this guy was so persistant
that it made me wonder what the deal was.

Is there some advantage to me fighting his pet? Will he be able to attack me
if I do?  Why would he want to if that's the case.

Sorry if these seem silly questions, but I'm still learning the ropes and am
really curious why he would want me too.  I should have asked him why but he
finally logged off after I told him no quite a few times.
