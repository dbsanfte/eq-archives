And yes, I remember those old games. In particular, I remember GS, when it
was running on Genie. More than about 30 people online and it crashed pretty
regularly. I met the love of my life in that game, role-playing. I also
"married" a warrior named Amra in Gemstone. I had a daisy, given to me, made
by a GM, which I treasured highly. I couldn't see it, I could only read its
description. It's certainly true that you had to use more imagination, since
there were no graphics, and I have to admit that some sort of ...
something... not ambience, but -something- is missing in the graphics glut
of today... still, there is much to be said for the extreme beauty of the
game/future of online RP games, even if they aren't the same as they were 15
years ago.

I'm not sure that people have lost a sense of what a game should be. I think
that people... -all- people... just have not been subjected to the game
world in the same way as some of us were. You find beauty where it lies.

For me, frustration comes when when it -does- become a job, rather than...
an adventure!!
