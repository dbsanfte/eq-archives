How about this?  SOE sets up a way to purchase a special in-game item on
your credit card: "Al'Kabor's Token of Trading" (make it Al'Kabor's so that
there will finally be something at least remotely useful with his name,
since his spells sure don't qualify!).  Say, $10.50 per token.

SOE also purchases back Tokens of Trading, for $10 per token.

Players can now do player-to-player transactions for real money by using
Tokens of Trading.  Somone wants to sell you 100k plat for $100?  You buy 10
tokens for $105 dollars, then trade them with him for the 100k plat, using
the existing in-game trading mechanism.  He then sells the tokens back to
SOE for $100.
