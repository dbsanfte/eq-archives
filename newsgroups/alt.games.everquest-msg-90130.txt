Ogre pros... Slam, No Stun, huge STR and STA at start... cons faction, size
can be a problem in cramped spaces, lowest CHA

Vah Shir pros... Slam, natural 'safe fall', lots of quests for newbies...
cons, weak stats for Large race, consume food faster, size

Dwarf pros... good stats (high dex = more wepaon procs)... cons low CHA
(you'll be trading at a loss early on, twinking adivised)

Barbarian pros... Slam, good faction, nice newbie area (you'll be quite
wealthy, comparativly)... cons no night vision, size

Troll pros... Slam, Regen!, high STR/STA at start... cons faction, poor
newbie area, size, low CHA

Human pros... faction, easy access to low level zones... cons average stats,
no night vision

Wood Elf pros... foraging, rare choice (not many WE Warrs about), reasonable
AGL/DEX... cons LOW STR/STA

Half Elf pros... biggest choice of starting locations, good DEX/AGL... cons
below avg STR/STA

Dark Elf pros... best night vision, good AGL... cons lowest STR (for a
warrior), lowest STA, avg DEX (doesn't make up for low str/sta like other
races)


Personally, I'd go for Troll or Ogre if you want to just hit things... Half
Elf or Dwarf if you already have a few weapons with a proc (PGT is a good
twink weapon for this reason... nice proc, starts low lvl) . Can't
understand why you've ruled out Iksar... they actually make good warriors
early on... tougher at mid levels with no Plate armour, admitedly.

YMMV
