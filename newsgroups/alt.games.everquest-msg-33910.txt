Couple Comments...

Change your 'takl', 'reply', 'auto attack' buttons at the least... Say your
in town with a shop keeper, window button out on accident purpose, and hit
A. R, or T. Everything after the reply/talk button up till your next
'return' key press will be replied to the last person on your list. It is
rare to actually send a 'tell' to someone tho but I changed it just in case
heh.

Now with 'say' and the like... only way not to say is NOT to press 'return'
key while EQ minimized... instead of hitting enter press the 'go' button...
or press the 'send' button on AOL Im (For me I talk to GF on AIM... kinda
bad for some of those messages to be said heh)
