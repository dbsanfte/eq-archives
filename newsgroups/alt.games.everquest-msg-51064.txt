Not sure, I have heard the theory about the 'a coyote', 'a rattlesnake' etc.
but I had also heard that noone had spotted them on track for some time, so
many assumed that they were the placeholders and since the game had been
found out Verant changed it.  (once gain, can't confirm, I don't have track)
It is probably quite true that my killing SG Hasam had something to do with
the AC spawn (interestingly enough they spawned in nearly the same spot).
Whether the undead did or not I don't know.  The undead by the way wasn't a
'a drybone skeleton', but 'crypt mummy' (don't think it had an 'a' in front
of it), in my case.
