For those who don't know the story yet, a riddle was put in the latest EQ
newsletter and two URLs were uncovered:

http://www.nektulos.com
http://www.wailingcaves.com

At first, I thought for sure these were paintings unveiling a new zone off
of Nektulos, but with the new screenshots on Castersrealm, you can actually
see jaggies, and the 4-sided trees that EQ made so famous. :) Now, either
they just rendered out some stuff in 3ds Max and posted them, or these are
actual in-game shots. What do you guys think?
