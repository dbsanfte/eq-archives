It would be an easier question to answer if you tell us what Didn't you like
that made you quit EQ earlier.  You said I could not understand it.  What is
it that you did not understand?

As far as levels, camping, and downtime, they are still there.

I suggest you hold out for Stars Wars Galaxies, and buy Never Nights now to
get you through before SWG is released!!
