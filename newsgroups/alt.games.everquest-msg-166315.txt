Hey,  this is a serious question:  Can anyone come up with a reason to petition
the name "Healea"?  I named my cleric that in a moment of mental lapse /
drunkenness / momentary insanity.  I hate it.  I know I could pay the $50 bucks
for a name change but FIFTY BUCKS??????  I have several friends who would
petition for me, (err... against me,)  if I can come up with a good reason to
give the GMs.  Any ideas?
