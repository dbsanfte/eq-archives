Personally I will get a temp if there is a cleric sitting at the
camp/dungeon entrance and I have a peri on me. If someone told me to get it,
I would expect them to pony up the peri or the 11p to buy one, and have a
cleric lined up to cast it now. I hate LDON groups that take 30+ minutes to
start an adventure, the reason I am doing LDON is usually because I am on a
tight schedule and want to take some frustrations out and kill some
pixels.......

Might as well go down the LDON group rant a little farther, why the heck do
people care what the group make up is, if the group is full, when you are
doing a normal mission? Any 3 people should be able to handle any normal
mission. (Ok maybe 3 warriors might have issues with a level 65 LDON because
of runners, maybe)
