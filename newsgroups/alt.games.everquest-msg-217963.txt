Play ping pong with a snared mob.

Shaman gives the enchanter pet the one thing it is really lacking, 
healing.

If the wizard can keep aggro on himself, and aggro kite, this can work 
quite well.

A lot rougher, with no snare, the rogue would have a really tough time 
hitting the mob, so, I'll give you this one.  Mind you, I have done tier 
2 groups with a rogue as the MA, which does, admittedly, significantly 
reduce his DPS, but, it did work just fine with a druid for healing, me 
for slowing.
