Hopefully by the 13th Verant would have fix up the major bugs. I expected to
see problems but not like this.  It would not suprise me if Verant would
give out a month bonus free time for their stuff up.

The other thing is with poeple reporting errors, it would be nice to know if
you have SOL or not.
