Yes, let's look at this.  How long did the original patch take?  8
hours?  The second patch another 3?  And how long for the third patch?
I don't know, but lets say it was another big one and took 9 hours.
So, let's say a totally of 20 hours of down time.

There are 30 days in a month and 24 hours in a day. *opens
Microsoft(tm) Calculator(tm)*  30 times 24 is 720 hours in a month.
20/720 is 1/36 of the total time you COULD have played EQ this month.
We're paying, what, $12.95 a month to play Everquest, which means they
have gypped you out of about $.36 of your fee this month.  You should
demand a refund.

Granted, I don't recall them ever promising 100% up time in the user
agreement anywhere, but I haven't checked in a long, long time.
