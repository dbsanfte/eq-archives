Pretty sure I've said this before, but ..

do a "/who all count" and "/who all druid count" during peak time .. Druids
usually come out to 1/9th to 1/12th of the entire population. How many
classes are there? 14? 15? There have been many times where I've done a
"/who all <class> count" for every class to check numbers .. I've seen many
times that there are often more warriors and clerics on than druids .. This
is during peak times too.

There's a lot of druids, yes. But there's not *THAT* many ..
