When did 1024x768 turn into the standard resolution?  I'm not saying you're
wrong, I've just been playing for 2.5 years and the last time I had to
fiddle with it was about 2.5 years ago when FS default was 640x480.

As to 5 being fine for you, you're probably younger than me. :)  Either that
or your color scheme is better.
