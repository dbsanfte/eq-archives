I'm not a shaman, but here is what I would do...
Fighter Classes - STR, DEX, STA, AGI, AC
Priest Classes - STA, AGI, AC
Pure Casters - STA, AGI, AC

That is just what you should consider - toss the buffs on a priest or pure
if theyre getting beat up alot (AGI will increase AC, STA for HP, AC for...
ac...), but you should always try to keep str and dex on a fighter, the
others just help get hit less and live longer, which never hurt... =)
