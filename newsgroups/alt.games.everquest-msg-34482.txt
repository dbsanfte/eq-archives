Here is my advice to new rogues.

Weapons -----  o to WC and EC and auc for a "bloodstained fang" 9dmg 34ish
delay piercer.  Peeps returning from iceclad often have these for sale 40pp
on Xev, or they even give them away if kindhearted.  This piercer will be
great until you are in your early 20's.  You should be able to solo easily
until level 10, then start grouping and never look back.  You will need to
group in order to max your backstab anyway. The delay on the fang is slower
than some but as a young rogue, this is sometimes a good thing.   It will
help you keep the argo on the tanks and help you stay alive.  You can go
"all the way" with piercing as a rogue.  Most rogues also seem to try and
keep the 1hs skill up as there are some nice rogish weapons there too. I
would try and keep a range skill up too. I prefer throwing for RP reasons.
As the pullers bring in a mob, just lob a shurken or dagger and soon the
skill will be maxed.  Good to have in case you have to pull and cant get
close enough for a backstab pull.

Armor ------   According to the latest consensis, AC is number 1 followed by
strength, so look to max those areas first.  I worked my way up to the 20's
with banded.  Banded is cheap ac and sometimes uppers give pieces to lowers
for free.   I then started aquiring Ravenscale armor and now have the full
set.  Ravenscale is the begining class armor for rogues and the black color
is good for RP reasons too.  I am happy wearing it but as I get into the
40's, I find myself lusting for myrkolar and other uber rogue armor.  RS has
good ac and is similar to ry'goor except it seems to lean towards the dex
and agi end of stat increases.  I play a dwarf rogue and have natural
strengh so that doesn't bother me, but you might want a few pieces of
ry'goor to increase str. I used a bracer of Erollisi (50pp) to up str as
well. It also seems to be cheaper on my server because it is rogue only.
Good Luck
