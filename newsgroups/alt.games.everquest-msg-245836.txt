A victory is when you complete your LDoN adventure within the allotted time.
Every 2 victories in a theme makes you eligible to get a 'valuable piece of
information' by hailing an NPC in the corresponding Wayfarers camp or a nearby
location. Your Adventurers Stone will increase in stats roughly every 10 wins /
5 hails.

Everyone gets the ability to use the /surname command at 20th level.
