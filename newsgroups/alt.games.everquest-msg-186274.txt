What, just once?  Pfft.  I'm going to kill her once, too - with EVERY

And Sebet, I was once where you were, young grasshopper.  Now I, too, 
can spout off things like "ooh he went to BoT and all he was wearing was 
SCHWs and he's so dead unless he's got a SBI and even then, he's dead 18

with a CLS and a LSoEE?  WTF eBay??"

Ah yes.  I have arrived.  ::zen::
