I don't think (although I can't remember now) that he did bitch and 
whine, either.  He just pointed out that to get to some of the great 
places in EQ, you have to dedicate most of your life to the game.  It 
kinda sucks, especially when you don't have time to play for a week, 
then come back and all your friends have moved on to the places for 40s 
and you're still in your 30s :/  But then, I don't want every idiot 
running around at 65 with three epics, either.  So what I'm saying is, 
it sucks, but don't change it.
