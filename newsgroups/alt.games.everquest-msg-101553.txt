Well, I've seen people petitioned for hanging out near a raid
invis'd as well as for taking faction hits without asking.  And
those people were asked - by the guide or GM - to leave the
area and/or zone.

From the PnP:

"Harassment .. goes to the state-of-mind of the ... party
on the receiving end of the action."

If you're hanging around a raid, either just to watch or to
grab faction, the other party may feel harassed.  That's up
to them, not you.  And you can bet that if they do /petition
they do, in fact, feel harassed.   And the GM is likely to agree
with them.  After all, why would they go to the trouble of
getting a GM's attention if they don't feel harassed?  And it
IS in the PnP that you can't harass other players.
