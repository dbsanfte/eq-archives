You should just be able to click the little box in the top left corner to
move the boxes... and click on the lower right corner box to change the size
of them (The ones that can be size changes like Text box and Buff box) and
as far as I know... when you move the boxes around the positioning stays the
same for all of your characters... I could be wrong... so if you move your
box on your main character and you log off and back onto an alternative
character the boxes should be moved on that pc also

hope this answers yer question... don't know about ini settings so you'll
have to find that elsewhere :)

good luck
