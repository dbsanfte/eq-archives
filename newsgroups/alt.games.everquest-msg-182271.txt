Start here

I was subscribed to a minor newsgroup last year when I replied to a troll.
Just one person responded in THIS way to which I replied apologizing, and
got a similar response to the one you have just given.  Made me so impressed
with the 'real' users of that newsgroup, no need to flame every damn noob
that has only just come across these things, just a please do not respond to
this <insert word here> will do.  Your attitude can put off people who can
become major assets to newsgroups over time.....


Thanks, feel free to respond to ETP's posts, I don't have to read your
reply, and due to decent filtering ability on my part by understanding my
equipment I usually don't have to download them.

Cheers
