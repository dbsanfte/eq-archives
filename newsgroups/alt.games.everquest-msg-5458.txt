I've taken both routes with my barbarian shaman, no trouble at all either
way.  If you take the evil route, you just have to jump ship, either after
it zones, or after it docks, either one seems to work, and swim to shore,
then zone a few times to get to LoIO, and/or on to FV to shake any pursuers,
and bind in a safer spot.  Personally, at that level, I stayed in OT,
merchant was handy, loot and xp were good.  I did make the run over to FV
from OT, was not a problem at all, OT to WW via tunnels to LoIO to FV.
