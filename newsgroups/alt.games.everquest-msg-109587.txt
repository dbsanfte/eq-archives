And if that dammage adds up to less than what you are regening then it has
no visible effect. If you have 50 AA points and dont have the regen of at
least 6 you are an idiot. A nice fungi tunic also helps. If you have primal
you damn well should be able to get the golden ulak from rhag 2 especially
since it is not no drop.

Try resist disease you schmuck. Unresistable my ass . For awhile they did
raise the level of the resist disease needed but it has since been lowered
back down to where a simple 50 is enough to resist almost all special
attacks.

I doubt so to if you are a 60 with 50aa in a good guild . My monk is a 55
twink in a good guild and has an ac of 1113 and 2200 hps self buffed. If you
noticed though I said that I can kill shrooms nonstop but cant pull them .
However when I get a few more levels where I can single pull them this will
get easy.
