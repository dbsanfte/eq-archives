A friend and I got the Velious expansion a month ago and just headed over
there.  All the NPC's appear to both of us as humans.  The Coldain are short
humans.  The frost giants are tall humans.  The spiders and tizmaks were
also human.  We both have different graphics cards, etc. but have the same
problem.  Has anyone ever heard of this?  Kinda hard to tell what creature
is coming over the hill when they all look the same hehe
We installed Velious after Luclin, so not sure if this is a factor
