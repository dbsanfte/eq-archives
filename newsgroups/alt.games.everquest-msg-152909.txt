I have not played for a few months, so the monkey is off my back. I have a
couple characters 20+ on a couple of different servers. A Human Monk, and
Gnome Enchanter. It's a good start.

I am not really selling the account, but if you wanted to offer me a few
bucks via Paypal I would not object.

All I ask is that you do not loot the characters and then dump them. I'd
prefer to give them to someone who will play. Perhaps you have a friend who
would like to play with you but not start at the bottom and work their way
to your level?
