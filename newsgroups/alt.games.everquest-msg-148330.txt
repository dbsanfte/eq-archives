Hmm.  I think, if you're able to run these files, there aren't going to be 
mobs or anything the server might provide, so you should be able to do it 
with your internet conection off and then restore everything to the way it 
was before you dial up again.  That way, Verant couldn't detect diddly, 
and no trojan could be sent.

Idealy, do it on a computer you never play EQ from. :)
