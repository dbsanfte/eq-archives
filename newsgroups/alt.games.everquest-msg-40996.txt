I grew up in Madrid, to the sound of the ETA blasts. I still have to
call my family to check up on them whenever a car bomb explodes there,
which is still something that happens with depressing regularity. I was
living in London when bins were removed from the Underground after the
IRA placed a bomb in one. I am really sorry and saddened to see that the
Americans are now being forced to live the same nightmare, scaled up to
a point simply beyond comprehension.

It's seems that no place is safe, and it's a difficult war to win when
you care about life more than your enemy does.
