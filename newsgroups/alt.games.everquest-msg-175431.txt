I've found this quest that starts in Cabilis that the end item is a sweet
Shaman only 1hb weapon with a right clicky mini-avatar that doesn't require
the emerald.  Now, my faction with Legion of Cabilis is maxed from killing
goblins in Warslik Woods while farming the gobbie earring but I still
require better faction with the guards and the shaman guild.  I've since
then found the bone chip quest that will raise all the
right factions.  Question one is how many Gdamn bone chips do I have to hand
in?  I mean, I'm coming up on 3000 chips now and I'm still Ready to Attack.
Please tell me it's not too much more :) Secondly, I had a guild chanter
follow me to FoB and cast Illusion: Iksar on me and I went from Ready to
Attack to the crusaders to Dubious, totally skipping Threateningly, how many
faction points does an illusion accually give you?  Would this mean I'm not
that far into KoS and I won't have to hand in that many more Bone chips?
Sorry for the long ass story, just don't want to have to see another
bonechip in my life after this quest is done! :)
