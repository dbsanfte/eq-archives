I have had a lot of fun partnerring/grouping with SKs, and while
darkness is a whole lot better than no snare at all, it is not nearly
as valuable as the druid/ranger snares with mobs that like to run
early and often.

Hmm.  No single ability is "needed" except in a fairly small number
of circumstances.  But there are dungeons where a fast-casting nuker
can be worth a lot in the train prevention department.

My point (minor tho it may be) was that your boast about your SK's
damage output was misleading, double hits near your max occur
infrequently and don't have a whole lot to do with your overall
damage output.

The point I failed to make is a lot more important.  If you spend your
time minmaxing your choice of groupmates on the basis of what classes
have for a skillset at your level du jour, you're gonna end up
remembered as just another jerk when those "undesirables" reach a point
in their careers where you suddenly want them around.  This may just
influence their choices in guild/groupmates, don't you think?
