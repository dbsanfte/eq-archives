I personally will keep trying to call plagues down until all of these things
occur, although it is ultimately God who will plague you. Actually that is
the only one, there is another one but I don't really feel like making that
dependant upon anything.

1) The United States goes to war against it's currently percieved enemies
with a concept of eventually having to fight additional enemies over time as
they emerge at least until the summer of 2006, after which it doesn't
ultimately matter but it would be nice if there was something there left as
a reminder, army of self-directed robotic soldiers might be interesting.
