At 34 a Druid can Quad Kite....

At 27 a Bard can Charm Kite, and By 34 you should be able to Chant/DoT
kite as well. Swarm Kiting is also an option for the Bard.

I would think that the two of you could come up with a pretty amazing
quad (or more) strategy by combining your abilities. Start with a
standard druid-quad and see where you can slip the Bard in for added
damage and reduced downtime..
