I might take the opportunity to chuck it all at that point and try this Real
Life mmprpg I keep hearing about.

But more likely I'd start again on the same server, and be happy to do so.

I've had a great deal of fun starting new alts and running them up, its a
lark.

I did "chuck it all" a couple years back, sold my account ( I know, evil
EBayer!) and tried RL.  Well RL turned out too buggy to bother with, so in
about 3 months I came back.  Tried to start over on the same server, but it
was too weird seeing my old character running around, and not being anywhere
close to a level where I could group with my old friends.  So I moved to
another server and started from scratch.

Well, that was good, but your doomsday scenario would be even better; I'd get
to start over from scratch with all my friends being in the same boat.  And
there wouldn't be tons of high levels hanging around PLing people or anything
either.  What fun!
