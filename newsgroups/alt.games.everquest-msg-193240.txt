    You still have to establish that it was wrong, though. Why do you feel
it was wrong?

    Considering the method for winning a GM event item is "show up, do what
you're told", there's not a whole lot of difference. Neither item is awarded
based on in-game skill, which is the usual method of obtaining something of
this calibre. And that's the main objection here from those opposed, that
something that is available in game from a very challenging encounter was
obtained by doing something other than completing that encounter (or an
equivalently challenging scenario). If a GM handed out a Blade of War to the
first warrior to find him in a serverwide hide-and-seek game, you'd see the
same complaints.

    According to the posts in the Veeshan thread on this, she had recently
left one of the top competing guilds on Veeshan. Joining FoH wouldn't change
a thing on Veeshan, so that leaves Cestus Dei or whatever they're called.

    Because actual damage is done, not hypothetical damage. Someone can
point and say, "Hey, this really affected me negatively." Things that don't
affect anyone negatively generally aren't considered "bad things", you know.

> As for prestige, who the hell cares, really?

    Um, the people capable of winning the Rallos Zek encounter and getting
this sword through hard work? Bragging rights and the desire to be the best
push a lot of players at the top end of the game, so it was possible that
one of them would be upset about this. But, apparently, they aren't.

    Exactly. There's no harm until there's actual damages. Saying "this is
wrong because someone COULD be angry" is overly cautious, especially given
the limited circumstances in which someone could have a legitimate
complaint. I'm not a fan of political correctness. ;-)

> That's not particularly thoughtful, is it?

    No, it's pragmatic. Hand out the prize, because the number of potential
legitimate complaints is limited and it is unknown if any of those parties
will care. If anyone actually is damaged by it, apologize, say that you
didn't mean any harm (which you didn't - this was meant as an act of
kindness to someone that helped out), and appease those that were damaged.
If nobody is damaged, no problems. If SOE tried to ensure nobody would be
upset before doing anything, nothing would get done and people would get
even angrier because of the inaction. You see this all the time in class
balancing discussions. One class comes up with a way to improve their class
and address a design issue, two classes immediately call for the solution to
be nerfed or disregarded because it would affect them negatively in some
remote way, nothing gets done, everyone gets angrier that their legitimate
complaints aren't being addressed.

    It's reasonable speculation, though. So calling it "silly" isn't really
justified, now is it?
