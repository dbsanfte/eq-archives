I play a 60 chanter . I play a 53 druid . I play a 54 cleric . I play a 27
monk when im just waiting for something interesting to happen . I have
absolutely no expectations of my monk ever being usefull, because from
playing the others I know exactly the relative value of one . I play it for
fun only so am not upset , but your trying to tell me the monk is better
than I know it to be is laughable. Monks with similar equipment for their
level and guild do the same dammage as warriors or so close as to be
negligible . Warriors have substantially more hps, more ac, and a taunt
skill that is a recognized necessity .
