I would add at LEAST 128 MB of memory.  It's cheap enough now that it
shouldn't be a problem.  Second - STAY AWAY FROM THE ATI VIDEO CARD!!!!!

People will testify that it's great, and it does this or it does that, but I
can guarantee you that you will hate it.  The Voodoo5 is a better option
than the ATI, (I'm running one on my second PC) but for $99(US) you can get
a Hercules GeForce 2 MX.  Highly recommend this card over the other 2.

Virtually everyone that has video problems has 1 of  3 configurations that I
have seen:

1 ATI Video card of some kind or
2 AMD processor.
3 both of the above.

Yes, other cards may have problems too (what component doesn't these days?!)
but in all honesty I think the GeForce 2 MX is really your best bet.
