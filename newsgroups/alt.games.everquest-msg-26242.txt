To get tailoring high enough, you have to add brewing in their too for cured
silk masks.

Actually blacksmithing isn't that bad for a tailor if you want to make your
own studded and reinforced armor. Some reinforced armor like the mask has
the same AC as banded at significant weight savings.

I just don't know about any player made arrows. They all suck and/or cost to
much to use.

I would advise you to find a level 20+ magician and *plead* with them to
summon you some arrows. The magician summoned arrows are 3 damage, add 50 to
the range of your bow, and are magic so they can be used for hunting
everything from ghouls to griffons.

Every magician I know in the game is the "Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit
out of my hat!" kind of personality, so you may not have to plead too hard.
More like
"Do you have the spell summon arrows?"
"Yes! Do you want a few hundred?"

Figures, I have noticed the same thing.

Good luck.
