No, it's not.  Kids are paid far more attention these days than they ever
were before.  Their opinions and beliefs are generally given far more
consideration than ever before.  No, the problem as I see it is that kids
will naturally push their luck as far as they possibly can.  And since
they're now more or less allowed to do and say absolutely anything in the
name of "expressing themselves" they've got no reason to stop at "gosh" and
"jeepers" any more.
