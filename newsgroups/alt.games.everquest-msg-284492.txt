As an all around puller, bards are the best the game can offer.  In
some situations a ranger might serve better, in others a monk, but for
all around pulling you cant beat a bard.

Hmmm, you get an upgraded feign but I think you may need to wait for
Luclin to use it.

Feign before you do it.  A pet's direct agro is direct agro on you as
well.  If you are feigned though, a pet's direct agro cannot transfer.
For some reason, a green pet will not cause social agro.  So as long as
you can agro a mob with a green pet, while feigned, only your pet's
target will chase it back to you.  The only other problem: the pet has
to live.

If an SK is tanking, he really shouldn't be pulling.  It slows down the
pulls something terrible.  Even if you dont need to split most of the
time, just the fact that you have to run out and get a mob will slow
down the exp considerably.  That said, I'm not sure why you are having
problems with snare.  Anything better than engulfing darkness will slow
a mob enough that when trying to wander back it will just stand there.
(Similar to fleeing mobs "running in place")  Are you just using your
lowest level snare to save mana?  If so, that is your problem...

The mob won't ever forget you until you feign for a good deal of time.
(Either long enough for it to reset--static mobs--or for it to forget
you--roamers)  Not only that, but in this situation it has probably
been agroed by your pet as well and your feign won't make a difference.
 Another thing to consider is that every time you get healed, the
feared add hates your cleric a little more...

Don't pull as an SK.  The is by far your best advice.  If that doesn't
work, find a place to pull where you don't have to split.  If you
cannot do either of the previous, then you are sacrificing serious
amounts of XP and I hope you are getting some damn nice loot in return.
