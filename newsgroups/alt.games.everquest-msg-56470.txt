This is correct. What REALLY gets me bent is that I bought EQ and paid for
my "free month"... then several months later, I bought EQ trilogy with
Kunark and Velious which includes a free month for new subscribers... but
when I opened my box, it seems they had already removed the free month from
it! What's up with that? the Expansions cost us MORE if we already play EQ?
How is that fair?

FYI, when that piece of crap AC got an upgrade the upgrade came with a free
month for new AND current subscribers.
