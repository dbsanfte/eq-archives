I solo, and I started my EQ account in May of 2004. I refuse to buy
gear via offline companies. I'll muddle along, but I see no reason
for me to raid. Of course, I doubted I would reach level 20 anytime
soon. But at present I have a ranger 17 and a druid 17. One or both
of them will likely be 20th level before January, 2006.
