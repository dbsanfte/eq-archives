There is generally some context-sensitive parsing, though. For the example
above, for instance, I would generally try "I will fight for the cause" or even
just "yes" before trying "what about...".  The latter  usually seems to work
best when talking about an item. "If only I had [a white sport coat] and a [pink
carnation]." "What a white sport coat?" "[Jeckel Enheid] borrowed my [white
sport coat]" "Who is Jeckel Enheid?" "Jeckel Enheid makes my [diet tonic]."
"What about diet tonic?" "I need ingredients but a halfing like you cannot help
me with that." "Why I cannot help?" "You will really help? Then collect two
snake scales and a rat ear pie and give them to [Jeckel Enheid]. He will give
you the [diet tonic]".

Yes, the grammar and missing brackets are typical of quests in EQ. In
particular, the grammatically confusing "Why I cannot help" is an actual example
from a quest which will only respond to that trigger phrase. The quests are fun,
but be prepared for some head-scratching while trying to figure out how to
trigger some of them.

Oh, and Jeckel Enheid is the real name of an NPC in Qeynos but he's just a
merchant so don't expect to get any diet tonic from him. :-P Now that I think
about it, that whole quest idea sounds like a fun way to get a shrink potion for
a fattie. *heh*
