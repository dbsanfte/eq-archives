What are the formulas for calculating:

Max HP
Max mana
Base resists

And what is INT good for?  Never seems to do me any good except when I
trying for skillups.  Really, what does it do?  I don't think it increases
max mana, does it?  And it doesn't increase mana regen, does it?  Or lower
cast times?  Or mem times?  Or scribe times?  So WTH does it do?
