Either I'm missing something here, or you are.  :-)

Hardly sounds like an "exploit" then.  The Verant definition of
exploit includes the concept of gaining an unfair advantage.
A losing strategy isn't an unfair advantage.  :-)

You miss my point -- the person I was responding to
asserted that, basically, the clerics were neither getting
beat on nor summoned.  My question was, if that was allegedly
the case, why would the Clerics NEED to be CoH'ed, OR
have their aggroed reset?  Clearly something *was* happening
to the Clerics which required saving their butts, contrary
to the claim that they were immune from harm.

Verant could fix this in an instant, instead of running
around screaming at people for doing it.  Just make
an in-zone rez go through the "loading, please wait"
process, and/or have it not clear aggro (I'm surprised to
find out that it does).
