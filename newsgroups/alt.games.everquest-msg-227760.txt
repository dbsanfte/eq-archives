It gains effects only for having flags, and only specific flags, to 
boot.  For example, the flag to get into POS/POV counts, but the one to 
get into NightmareB or POI factory don't.

Being able to get in due to level doesn't count, but whether you get the 
flag at 46 or at 65 it -does- count.

The theory being espoused here is that you will naturally be getting 
flags as you level up.  Thus far I haven't seen that, as a non raiding 
character, I don't see getting any flags anytime soon; I can get into 
tier two just due to level (instead of requiring a raid sized force to 
get the flag for CoDecay, or 5 level 65s to limp me thru a POJ trial for 
the POS/POV flag), and by the time those start to pale I'll be 62 and 
able to get into tier two without a raid sized effort to take down the 
boss giants in POS (for BOT flag) or a dragon in POV (for HOH flag).

It is true, though, that the flags do give you a charm (and upgrade the 
charm) plus a free AA point, and that might make them worth getting 
after you are up at a level where doing so wouldn't be so difficult to 
pull off.
