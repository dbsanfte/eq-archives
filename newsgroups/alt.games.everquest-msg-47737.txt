If you know someone who has EQ, ask them if you can borrow it for a bit. You
only need it long enough to put EQ back on your system, as your account is
stored server side.

You won't even need your CD key, just login as normal and you'll be good.

You will however have to DL all the patches over again. Hope you have a
cable modem.

If you have a game store near you, and you are in good with a clerk or two,
then explain your situation to them. They might let you borrow it long
enough to copy it to your system.
