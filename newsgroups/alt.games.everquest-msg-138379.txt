No I  have a single  point here, it is you who is practicing duality. 
By attempting to mingle the concepts of in game ownership and real life
ownership you present a false argument.

No, I didn't.  I concluded that you own NO in game items remember?  Your
character has ownership of the items he has in his inventory in game. 
Lets look at that sentence carefully and in great detail because it
seems to be the one that you are having so much trouble with....


"Your character"
This is technically a series of entries in a database but discussing it
in terms of fields and records doesn't really help any more than
recognizing it as simply a given avatar within the user interface, so
lets stick to the simple.   Somehow I get the feeling that simple might
be a good idea with you.

"has ownership"
This means that he in has claim to these items.  He has control,
authority and the like over these items.  Now don't rush off into your
rebuttal yet, English is a tricky language and while we've defined this
segment of the sentence there could and in fact will be modifiers coming
later.

"of the items"
These again are really UI representations of fields within data tables,
but within the context of the game, where the character exists, they are
in fact items, real goods if you will.

"he has in his inventory"

Not that "he" refers to the character as defined above and similarly
"his" refers again to the character.  Neither of these references
applies to you, only the character.  Inventory again really speaks of
records and data sets, but for simpler purposes I'm sure you can
recognize that the term applies to that portion of the data set over
which the given character has direct control via the user interface
entries of the player (personal inventory as well as bank).

"in game"
Just in case you forgot, this  is that tricky English thing I was
referring to earlier, its a really important modifier.  In the interests
of making sure you are getting this let me repeat "IN GAME"!

At no time have we said that you, the player, have ownership of anything
by virtue of your character's ownership of items within the game.  Your
ownership is clearly spelled out in the EULA which I get the impression
you are familiar with, you own a CD and a right to pay for account
access, Sony owns the databases which contain the records related to
your account.  Neither of these facts negates the fact that within the
context of the game your character owns the items in his inventory.

I realize this may not be the simplest thing to fathom, it is what is
known as abstract thinking.  It requires you to hold concepts in your
mind rather than objects in your hand and is not something  everyone is
good at.  I am far from being the best teacher and I'm sure that my
efforts in this post will likely not help you to understand, but what
sort of person would I be if I left you in ignorance without at least
attempting to help you comprehend how silly  you were being?

As I have stated above and quite clearly previously, I agree, you do 
not own items in a fictional fantasy world, your fictional fantasy
character who lives in that world owns them IN GAME.

True enough, it  is indeed a matter of record that you believe it.  Of
course you have issues with abstract thought so who knows what other
manner of silliness you believe?
