In California, at least when I lived there, the law was specifically that 
you only run the red light, if your car has not entered the intersection 
(only the front of the car needs to do so) prior to it changing to red.  
Mind you, arguing with the police officer about it afterwards is a bad 
idea...  Save your arguments for court, and pray the officer doesn't show 
up.
