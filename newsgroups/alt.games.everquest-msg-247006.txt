  Hi,  I recently made one of my toons A Player killer.  Just for fun. 
However, Immediately right after, I went to PoK for a KEI and it 
wouldn't stick?  Is this a PK thing and have I ruined this toon?
   If so is there anyway to go back from the dark side?  Any help would 
be appreciated.  thanks
