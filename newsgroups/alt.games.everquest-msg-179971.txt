This message is off topic for the newsgroups. In another message in this
thread mentions that no man has ever heard or ever will hear God. Then who
told Noah to build the Ark, Who told Adam and Eve they had to leave the
Garden of Eden, Who told Moses the 10 commandments?  Also if God doesn't
talk to anyone he can give signs to people, maybe that's what this person is
saying.
Just my opinion.
Sorry for adding to the off topic message.
God Bless
