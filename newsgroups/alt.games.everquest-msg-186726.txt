Just sounds like another Microsoft sheep to me.

Microsoft could market refrigerators in Antarctica and get people to buy
them.  Marketing is the thing they do best ... convince people that
vaporware is software.  It took them to version 4.0 of NT to get the product
to actually provide 80% of the functionality they promised when they
announced the NT project.  The stuff based on the 95 kernel was the same way
... it was until Win98 that Chicago/95 did most of what they marketed it to
do.

Still, people are sucked in by the catchy commercials and Rolling Stones
tunes, so they buy it.  And since businesses buy it, businesses send people
to train on it.  And the monster gets continually bigger.

He doesn't understand the difference between the ability to write code and
the ability to market.  Nor does he want to.  He just wants to argue.  Being
a keyboard warrior gives him some measure of self esteem, I'd wager.  And
yes Ben, if you're reading this, I'd happily say that to your face.

His problem is that there's no middle ground in anything ... it's all one
way or another.  You're for his position or against it.  And if you're
against it, you're an idiot.

That's why I had to end up putting him in that empty little room that holds
the old Fighter Ace spammers and crossposters ... my killfile.  I hate to
killfile regulars, and this may be the only case where I've done so, but the
arrogant pretentiousness just got to be too much.

And I must say that all of the sudden it's a nicer world.

In about six months I may pull him out of there.  It's possible, but not
likely.  And I just know that'll keep him up nights. ;-)
