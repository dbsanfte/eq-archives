The spell you're looking for is "Spirit of Sharik". This used to be the pet
level buff but is now the pet summons spell. This is true for all spell
levels. Caster's Realm is a little screwy in that they have "Summon Warder"
listed as a 9th level spell, which it never was. Until recently it was an
ability you gained at 9th.

So forget about Summon Warder and just pick up what used to be the pet level
buffs.
