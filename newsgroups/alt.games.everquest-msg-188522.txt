And I might have been the guy who bought your kiolas.

You're right, it's absurdly easy, but the fact is that I generally
need a few hundred of them whenever I want to tailor with them, and
the thought of making them myself makes me just feel like puking.

I've made a couple thousand kiolas myself, and never again, what a
pain in the ass.

As for the original poster:  Wouldn't work on me!  My baz mule's level
1, and he'll *never* be level 2.
