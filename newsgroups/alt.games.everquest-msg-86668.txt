Theres a thread in the quests area of the safehouse with all the items for
twilight armor listed.

No prices yet on twilight armor yet, theres not enough of it on the market
yet, although you could probably make a 1 for 1 trade on non-jewel pieces
(jewels are used in all the classes armors, though a different piece for
every class for a given jewel)  if you traded a class specific item for a
jewel you'd be getting a ripoff since the jewels are slightly more common
than the other stuff given that they're used in all the armors.

I sell jewels to vendors anymore since I need the bank space and don't
particularly care for any of the druid armors, I have better in all the
slots that I've seen stats for yet.
