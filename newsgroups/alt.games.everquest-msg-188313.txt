}Anyone have any info on the spawn timer for Donally (mob near the Qeynos
}docks used for the first Qeynos badge quest). I've been checking on him for
}days, and have evern camped him several hours - I have yet to find him up.

I just recently did this quest with some friends.  We did it twice within 
a span of a couple hours.  We didn't check anything very carefully about 
him spawning, but my best guess is that he was a triggered spawn from your 
previous handin/conversation with the investigator.  If you futzed around 
too much looking for him, he may have despawned on you, and you might have 
to start again.

I know my partner helped a friend do the quest the day before, they didn't 
encounter any difficulty either.  There was some issue, however, with the 
investigator getting randomly whacked by passing corrupt guards, so you 
might want to watch out for that.

All in all, a very fun quest.  And I wear my Qeynos Badge of Nobility with 
pride.  Even if my new Leviathan Eyes spell from LoY makes its effect 
slightly less keen. :)

You didn't state your level, but I do think that except for the very last 
step with Barducks Darkpaw, pretty much anyone should be able to solo the 
whole quest at level 50ish fairly easily.  Possibly even earlier.
