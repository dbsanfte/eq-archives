And/or artificially low drop rates.  My gripe with the Paladin
epic is that the (intentional) bottleneck is the dragon drops.
The dragons are week-long spawns, *and* are fought over by guilds
because they drop several nice items, *and* don't drop the books
terribly often, *and* most dragon-slayings have several Paladins
in attendance, so you often lose the (low spawn rate, low drop
rate) items on a roll when they finally show up.

And then you need to do that *TWICE* (once for the burnt book,
once for the frost book).

It's not a quest, it's not epic, it's a bloody lottery.
Just keep buying your tickets once a week (presuming you can
even *get* on a raid and it's not claimed by another guild),
and hope that your lucky number finally comes up on
some week in the far future -- *twice*.

Lo, the questgiver says, "kill a dragon over and over and
over and over and over again, maybe you'll get lucky someday".
It's a job, not an adventure.

What?!?  James, you don't have a rez stick yet?  But you're
level 60!
