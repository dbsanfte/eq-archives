What kind of advice is that? The monk tells you he can't loot and you say
"spend 5k for a bag".  Of course he doesn't have 500 pp.  Not everyone is a
twink.  And where is your average monk going to get a summoned bag?

And you, my monkish friend.  Hunt jewels, keep platnum, and recognize that
you CAN go over 15 pounds.  You just loose (a lot of) AC.  Work on your
feign death.  Join a good group and pull the mob for them.  When you get the
mob back, FD to break the aggro and let the tanks do the killing (you can
hit all you like as long as they don't turn on you).

Also, hunt Delnir dungeons for crescent armour.  Why buy it if you can kill
for it?
Warslik Woods was a good place for gems, but the mob there will be (mostly)
green to you now at 35.
