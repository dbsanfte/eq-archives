A couple of months ago a friend sold me some Bone Chipped Rods (3 charges of
Locate Corpse) he purchased from a vendor in Firona Vie for 24pp each.  I
was just in FV yesterday and bought them for 8pp each.  Did the price go
down signifigantly?  BTW, I then found them in my starting city of Rivervale
later that night for 6pp each.  I am almost positive these were not
available in RV 2 months ago!
