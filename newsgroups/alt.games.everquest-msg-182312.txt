Now that everyone has answered you, did you go see if you could get
him? :-)

MM tower is still a pretty decent place to take a low 30s party. Not
CC good obviously, and the large numbers of casters means bring a
couple healers, but MM dungeon bonus plus outdoor zone, high exp
caster mobs... a good party can rock that place.

My old guildleader was obsessed with that chestplate. It was black,
and it had +str (IIRC). This was back so long ago we still didn't know
AC for warriors was king, and we were wearing stat boosting armor
whenever we could (my warrior wore serp bracers!). He camped in there
for days. But Garton is not a friendly spawn. He is one of the true
"ultra-rares". And so I don't think Crush ever got his bp. Can't
remember for sure though....

I always wanted to a "Norrath's Most Wanted" webpage with a list of
the rarest of the random named spawns.
