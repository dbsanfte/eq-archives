Wrong answer.  Disappointing really, it seems to me that my question
is perfectly clear to any veteran player aware that I have been
playing the game and active on this board for quite some time now.
Or do you actually imagine that I don't know what the Cleric's
class defining spells are and what levels they get them at?

You have answered the wrong "why".  The simple mechanical question
is totally uninteresting, anybody who's played the game for a few
months has no excuse for not knowing what you posted.  Now, please,
somebody tell me "why in hell should a 52 Cleric be 100% effective
grouping way above his level, while a 52 plate tank [or a 52 Wizard]
would be useless?"
