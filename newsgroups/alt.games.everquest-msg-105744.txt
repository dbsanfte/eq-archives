First, I'd like to point out that your snip makes it appear at first
glance as if my comments were made by Faned.
Second, I'll mention that within minutes of the post you replied to
I posted the following more coherent and accurate assertion:
----------------------------------
Gah, now I know it's time to go home.  displayed ac > 153 compared to
displayed ac of 59.  difference < 5% in damage per attack.  ac 59 was
hit far less often than ac 153.  displayed ac is not directly effecting
combat resolution in any discernable way.
----------------------------------
I stand by my amended assertion.  I cannot in fact see how you can
quarrel with "displayed ac is not directly effecting combat resolution
in any discernable way", given the observed results.

Further, I find at more than a bit odd that you and others are
obsessing over "level" per se, given the difference in the level
capped Defense skill (what exactly do you think the Defense skill is
affecting if "level" accounts for the results?).  Also I would point
you to Suineko's post in this thread regarding ATK and AC replacing
their component stats in the UI.  Finally, most discussions I've read
on AC in long running forums show a clear awareness of the dual nature
of passive melee defense in EQ.

I have done a little bit more testing, I don't have the logs here, but
a couple numbers I recall:
at L4, Defense 20, displayed AC 201 (full banded, no shield/jewelry):
miss = 58% (no significant difference from naked L4/D20/AC59 = 57.71%)
average damage / hit = 1.47
The miss percentage shows no effect at all on the chance of the mob
scoring a hit.
The average damage result however is lower than I expected (average
damage at L1 with Defense 1-3 was 1.90) so now I'll have to sit thru
the tedium of a bunch of deaths for a duplicate character naked at
L1 to compare the damage per hit to the naked L4/D20 result of 3.64.

I'm not sure I'll bother testing "a fire beetle" vs Defense 215,
it'd take forever to get enough hits unless they have an "auto-hit"
chance of 5% or higher (like the old DnD always hit on a 20 rule).
It might be amusing to see if my armor could get a L4 up even with my
52 paladin's naked AC, but I'd have to have a friend nearby for the
transfer, I'm not gonna risk a drop-transfer of my main's gear, heh.

What I might do is try LGuk and/or Rathe Mountains without my armor.
That might be fun.  It might also be an efficient way to delevel.
Gonna have to think that one over.  Still, comparing naked to banded
to "real" gear vs. high green thru lo blue mobs might be illuminating.
One thing I wont do is try L50+ mobs without gear at 52, that would
hurt too much, they hit hard plenty often enough as it is (there's a
reason so many people have "Ranger Down!" hotkeys).
