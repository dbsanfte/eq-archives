Quick questions first; how tough was he?  What else did he drop besides the
cleric thing?

If Verant got off their asses and made the damned thing spawn no less than
once every 3 days (sooner on server reset) like they said, I think that
after the first month or two it'll be a much easier situation.  Still a race
to see who can get there first, but the ubers (the only ones to worry about)
should be pretty much done getting theirs by then.
