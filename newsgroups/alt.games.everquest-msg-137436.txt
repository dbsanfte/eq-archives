There is no set price really, unless you agree a fee before the port.

For a TL I pay 10-20pp - it depends how much plat I have on me.  If I don't
have any plat on me (and im in DL for example) I will just go kill 3 or 4
mobs till I have "donatable" plat... always at least 10pp tho

If i've got 30pp on me then I'd pay that.. I pay with random junk I have on
me too (e.g Velium round shield, +15 AC +10 vsCold  crappy shield, but looks
nice, for a port)

The chip costs around 1pp for TL to certain zones (velious, commons etc) and
its a teeny weeny amount of mana used for the spell.. when on my wizard I
don't charge for TL's (but unless I really had nothing to do, I wouldn't
port non-friends)

Recently I asked for a TL to bind (no cost involvement in this type) and I
would have donated.  He asked for 50pp minimum (yeah right). So I told him
politely to kiss my ass, and thought "hope he never needs a rez from me"..
cuz in my opinion that was unreasonable

Before people whine about that above comment, sure its upto him to ask a
fee.  I also have an idea of what I thinks acceptable though.  And its down
to me who i rez.  i don't charge for them, but I do them under my time and
under my conditions.  He won't be seeing one from me.

And yes, I do note the big difference between a TL and a port - this is a
post about TL's

i dont pay guildies ever.. but im in a long term guild, the kind where
people are around a long time... I know everybody and everybody knows me - I
would drop anything in a heartbeat if they needed my help.. would log my
cleric on *just* to rez them etc
