This killed me once.  Running to a one-group Ikki trial, I did my usual of
casting Divine Aura then sprinting for the zone-line.  Just as I was
approaching the corridor that leads to the zone-in of the trial, I hit the
corner wrong somehow and got warped *away* from the corridor.  DA faded and
the ten mobs I had on my tail made quick work of me.

I am *so* glad that this "feature" has been removed.  =)
