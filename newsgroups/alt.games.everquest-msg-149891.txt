True.  But I got from his post that he was saying cheaper=more efficient.

What you say is also true for you DO have the option of being efficient,
which is most (50%+) of the time.  A big percentage (gotta be 75%+...most of
the rest taken up with unexpected adds, link death, etc) of the time when
two people need heals NOW are either due to:  a) 1 being an enchanter (very
common), or b) someone screwed up stayed on top of the Hate list too long.

The b-list people need to be left to die sometimes.  On purpose.  Nothing
teaches the need for aggro management quite like death.

My guild has a monk who hates to FD when we have a perfectly good MT.  When
I play his healer I tell him I'm not going to heal him until after battle.
The same could be said about many classes, so I'm not picking on monks, just
using him as an example.
