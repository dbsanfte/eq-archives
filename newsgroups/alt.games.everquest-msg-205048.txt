Another newbie question. I've been soloing BB with my lv11 bard and all of a
suddeb these Greenbloods start attacking me on sight. I killed the first
one, but didn't like the look of the faction hits. I could easily outrun
them. Should I do that or just enjoy the easy xp.

Also, I need to go to Freeport to pick up my next couple of songs. What does
the trip cost and how safe is it? I've got limited funds and want to make
sure I have enough to buy the songs. I also don't want to have to be looking
for my corpse at the bottom of the ocean.

Thanks,
Curtis
