I agree with you here.

I have a serious question.  How does power leveling and twinking
newbies undermine game balance?  I have played EQ for nearly 4 years
and my highest character is a 62 Bard.  When others look at me they
say, "This must be your main" and they are accurate based on the gear
I'm wearing.  Heck, I was still wearing a Cougar Claw Earring at 60. 
There are level 20 bards running around in better gear than what I
have but that fact has never affected the game for me.  Over the years
I've received a heal when I was soloing or someone cast thorns on me
and even now anytime I want to solo I always seek a Virtue or
Conviction in PoK, but I have never been power leveled by a person or
group of people standing next to me and finishing off mobs when they
were below 50%, or doing other things to help me get experience.  I
have seen other players receive this kind of help but again, other
people getting power leveled does not affect the game for me.  I'm
curious to know, how have twinking and power leveling ruin or
undermine you EQ gaming experience?

With the exception of blatant cheating, kill stealing, gold duping,
ect...how have someone else's playing choices impacted the way you
play (or played) Everquest?  Other people's playing choices used to
bother me in regards to power leveling and twinking when I first
started but ultimately the real issue envy and jealousy.  It only
bothered me because I was not getting power leveled and I was not
receiving great gear from higher level players.

If you zoned into Plane of Disease and you saw me charm kiting twenty
mobs would my playing style have an impact on your game?

I would like to hear you or others chime in on how the style of
someone else's play undermined your game play in Everquest.  I'm not
talking about camp stealing or kill stealing or being trained on.  Say
you are in Paludal caverns at B1 and there is another group at B2 and
they have a level 65 Druid babysitting them casting thorns and healing
their tanks.  Does that impact your game?  Let's say you are hunting
in Crushbone with your level 14 warrior wearing newbie armor and
another level 14 warrior comes into the zone with a Fungi Tunic.  Does
that impact your game?
