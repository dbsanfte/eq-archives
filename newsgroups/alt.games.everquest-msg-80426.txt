Well, I'm glad to hear that the Ents are in there... oh, I can just see them
tearing down Orthanc! No, I couldn't see him leaving them out either, it was
just hard for me to imagine it. I figured out the cloak and pins part, not
from the movie (though I knew that that was when they all started wearing
them, but from re-reading the book. Wasn't aware of the rope though.

thanks,
Darklet
