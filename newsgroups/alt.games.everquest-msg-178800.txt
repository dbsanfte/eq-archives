Kodiaks, Giant Scouts and blood wolves in GD for three. The largest of
each type are still yellow at 35. (That's only a level after we moved
there when coming up through the levels.) Hell, I was kiting them with
my wizard at 35, albeit with some difficulty, but I preferred the lower
con wolves. Tarre (necro at same level) could handle them with ease,
albeit with more downtime than on the lower blues.

That's just one zone. Necros handle even and even slightly higher con
mobs for many levels past 35. I watched a 49 necro solo the dino in OoT
last year. (Though it was one hell of a long battle.) Necros soloing
yellow cons at 35 is nothing shocking at all if they know what they are
doing. But they'll still get more xp plowing through a ton of lower dark
blues, like anyone else.
