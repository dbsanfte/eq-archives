I'm only half way into 60, so this isn't a "I thought I'd be 61
in five minutes" bitch.

But rumor has it you need a certain number of points in AA as
well?  Thats going to be annoying.  Since most cleric AA are
about as worthwhile as a warm pile of spit, I was planning on
leveling up instead of working on them, same logic as why I
didn't get AA at 54 other than run 1: Level > all!

Anyone else see the contradiction in requiring "alternate"
advancement in order to level up "normally"?  I mean, doesn't
sound all that "alternative" anymore!
