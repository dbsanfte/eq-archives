Wrong. See my first followup.

We've had a similar situation that resulted in our guild getting
the epic; there was a Valon cleric waiting for her handin, she'd
been there longer than ours, had rezzed folk, we accidentally
trained her goofing about and got her killed, but at the end of
the day we had forces they didnt. Someone tried to steamroll
her and our guild stopped it by providing the force and then stepping
back for her to do what she needed to... now this is the amazing bit...

She told our cleric to go ahead. Insisted.

There are some really nice people in the world; she'd been there longer,
and we would have deferred to her, but she figured we'd done the work,
and she'd wait till her guild could get it together... (shes in one of
the two top uberguilds on our server, probably the best in fact, so I
guess she had the consolation of knowing it *would* come together for
her, but even still... having it offered up on a platter and saying
no. Respect ;) )

We do choose how we behave. We have to take responsibility for that. the
world isnt fluffy bunnies; its shit heads and vindictiveness, partly. but
I dont think that justifies promulgating that type of behaviour.

I dont think Arolpin's guild did "wrong"; the didn't do the *noble* thing,
but I dont think they did the wrong thing. The problem seems to be Arolpin,
and a fair few of us, aspire in EQ to be the noble hero of fantasy lore.

That means sacrifice, a lot of the time, and getting an entire guild to
agree to sacrifice rather than doing it on an individual basis can be
Bloody Hard.

The problem is, with PNP, one set of assholes can overturn any agreed
mechanisms and turn the situatioon into a slug out KS fest, or a situation
where person after person can turn up and force a roll, closer and closer
to the spawn time, wasting everyones time.

And they do.

I /feedbacked suggesting that anyone invoking the PNP on that scale shoul;d
have their request broadcast to the server; after all, Verant makes all that
fuss about carrying your reputation with you.

Let the rest of the players make up their minds on its merits.

"Hear ye hear ye. In the conflict of X versus Y over the lands the
dragon Ragefire ravages ownership is awarded to X, as they rolled
a higher random number."
