A possible explanation for hide popping on/off... Hide will pop off if hit
by a negative effect from a spell, I assume a bard song does the same.  It's
like being hit while invis and having invis drop.  If it does work that way,
one way a bard can avoid a BS from a sneak/hide rogue is keep an AOE  damage
song running and watch 3rd person.
