Thanks for all the help with my new Bard.  I came across a couple things
last night that I have questions about.  I'm sure you guys can help:

1.  What's the difference between a lute and a mandolin?  I bought them
both, and they both appear to do the same thing as far as I can see.

2.  I found a vender that sold instruments in Katta Castellum.  She sold
regular lutes and mandolins, etc for a few plat.  Then she also had
'combine' lutes, mandolins, etc for I think around 40-50 plat.  They look
the same to me and when I click to get the info on the instrument, there's
no difference.  I know that some instruments are better, but how can you
tell how much better?  Is the fact that it's 'combine' make it more
valuable?  What does 'combine' mean?

3.  The lvl 8 song - Kelin's Lugubrious Lament - Is that sort of like
harmony?  Can you cast it on multiple mobs, and then pick one mob out?  I
have a druid, and I was wondering how it works kinda in relationship to
harmony.

Thanks!!

Connie
