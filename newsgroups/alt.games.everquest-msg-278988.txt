The "room" I mentioned was a metaphor for this particular Usenet group. 
That should have been evident. Who uses Usenet as a chatroom?

Honestly, your apology doesn't mean jack, as you can't possibly mean it. 
If you were truly sorry, you wouldn't persist in that for which you 
apologize. There is no misunderstanding. You insist on ruffling 
feathers. This is not an auction site, yet you continue to use it as 
such even in light of near-unanimous protest.

How's it feel to be a pariah? Bah, nevermind answering. I won't see it.
