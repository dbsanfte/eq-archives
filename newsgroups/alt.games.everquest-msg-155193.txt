She was right but only partially, many Asians are not able to digest dairy
products properly and therefore could give such sideeffects.
It is a genetic oddity just like the sickle cell anemia genrally not found
in others then people of african heritage.
Westerners should be ok from those effects unless one is lactose intolerant
in some form (could give gaseous effects).

Who knows and loves Weetabix (especially with raspeberry jam on top and
server with cold milk) and it is hard to find in alot of countries i have
only seen it in speciality grocers and health stores here in the US and back
in Sweden only in select stores.
