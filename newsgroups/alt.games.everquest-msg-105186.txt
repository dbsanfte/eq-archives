Including Med time ?

But are easier to obtain than mana regen items (I guess that regen items
on a necro do both :-)

I am in the unfortunat position of not being able to effectivly twink,
my main is only 32 :-(

So can you explaine to me how increasing only the mana pool of a caster
increases his power that significantly at low levels. From my outsider's
point of view I can't see how having even twice as much mana is going to
radically change your performance.

I can see that you will be able to take down higher con targets (as you
can shoot of more nukes etc.) but other than that how does it help ?

If you could med faster I could understand (less down time) but with
more mana you just have to med for longer. I can see it being easier to
level, as you can kill more mobs then go to a safe place and med for
longer, but how does it make it significantly faster ?

From the way you are talking I must be missing something stunningly
obvious. Please enlighten me.

Jim
