The meditate button serves no purpose until you are able to use meditate,
and have trained one point at your trainer in meditate.

It automatically gets activated when you click on spells. It used to be that
you needed to press spells, then meditate. But that didn't make sense since
there's no reason to be in your spellbook without meditating so they linked
the two together.
