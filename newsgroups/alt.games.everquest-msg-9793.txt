Hey Biz, are from Ct area?  I remember a guy on the radio who called himself
the WigMaster and he did the Friday Nite WigOut on the way home about 5pm.
GottaGottaWig etc.
I miss the east coast/ct area.
No decent pizza's in Dallas, Pizza hut wins a best pizza award here, and no
good fried rice, made in batches not serving at a time the way it should be.

Oh yeah, hunt someplace else if you are bored with the mobs loio.
