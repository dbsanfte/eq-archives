	I sold Shadewood bows to just about all archery classes.  (Almost no one
sells arrows, and those that try don't do it for very long.  Even before
Endless Quiver -- it's just too tedious.)  Other than Rangers, the only thing
most people do with a bow is pull, and a Shaped Shadewood Compound is just as
good for that as any of the DN bows.  (Bows better than the DN bows are not
tradeable...except for the Faydark Thunderbolt, of course....)

	All the WE cultural bows are all-race, all Archery classes except SK, and
Tunare only.

	Are there going to be lots of people who can't use them?  Sure.  But the
price on the Shadewoods is going to fall below the marketable point anyway,
since they're no longer the best PC-made item.
