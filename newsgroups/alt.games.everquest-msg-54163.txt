About slow.. It depends greatly on level and hardness of mob. I just sweared
on one dummy shaman who thought that everything needs to be slowed in OT
ledge group (members 31 to 36 in levels) and he always was OOM and did not
haste (quickness) 3 tanks that were in group. Quickness is 80 mana and lasts
several battles there PLUS it never gets resisted. This shammy casted slow
(tagar's insects, 125 mana) on mobs which usually got resisted on 1 of 3
casts. So I think in that case haste was far better than slow but I know
that higher level encounters require shammy to slow mobs as clerics wont be
able to heal tanks fast enought without slow.

Just my 2 cp.
