At level 14 if you retrieve your corpse it seems to take about 10 kills 
to repay your xp debt during which time you're only getting maybe half 
normal xp. So a single death isn't too bad. But if you died two or three 
times in an area, then it's significant, and enough that you'd certainly 
want to not be there any more.

So I'd say that the death penalty is enough to stop you trying to play 
in areas that were too hard, but not enough to totally discourage 
exploration and risk taking. Just enough that when the risks turn into a 
few deaths you change your mind.

As others have said your equipment accumulates damage when you die too 
and you need to pay to get it fixed. It's a small amount below level 10 
but does add up.

Indeed. The penalty in EQ2 assuming you get your shard is a lot less 
than an unrezzed death in EQ1 (At medium levels) but a lot more than the 
  typical 96% rez in EQ1.
