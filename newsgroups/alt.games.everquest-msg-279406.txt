Not difficult at all. Although they may have to sift through no-drop 
quest drops that happen to be gear to ensure nothing becomes droppable 
that shouldn't be.

Its a terrible idea though.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Have nots include people who just 
started, and so forth. I'd only want to ensure everyone *can* reach 
'adequacy' in a 'reasonable' timeframe, doing diverse and 'interesting' 
things. If I wanted everyone the same all the time I'd eliminate gear 
and levels from the game and call it a coop first person strategy game.

So unwind the circles so that *anyone* can move 'forward'. That's the 
problem.

So you'll level slower. Nobody is inherently against that.

Or have played for the last 6 years and realize just how much easier its 
gotten.

To address your attunable suggestion thought. Its a colossally bad idea. 
Nobody wants to acquire all their gear forever in the bazaar. Why play 
at all if all your going to do is farm plat so you can buy gear to allow 
you to farm plat so you can buy gear...

Meanwhile someone else actually does all the interesting fun stuff, 
hunting interesting and fun mobs, while the most effective use of YOUR 
limited time will be to farm spiderlings or ice giants or geonids or 
some other cash camp.

If you think doing LDoN / DoN over and over again for gear upgrades is 
bad, imagine spending your life farming greens for cash, as your most 
'effective' use of your limited time.

That'd be outright pathetic.
