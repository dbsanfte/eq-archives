hmm...I play a wizard..let me assure you, a good wizard does not have to be
locked into one role. I can root to keep an add from beating on a party member,
I can snare in the absence of a ranger or druid, I can evac...and once I hit 57
(very soon) I can do an intra-zone evac

And those translocates come in very handy for melees...
