I'm wondering, with SoL, but with everything graphically removed, including
not installing the retexture, turning off ALL enhanced graphics, what is the
lowest end computer I could possibly run it on?  I'm thinking of buying
another cheap computer to practice networking and also would be nice to be
able to run EQ on it to hand off stuff, use a mule, etc.  Also I'm guessing
from what I've read before, it's not possible to log into the same account
on two computers but with two different characters?  Or is this possible?
Thanks for any advice.
