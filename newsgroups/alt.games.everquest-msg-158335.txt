I disagree that druids are second best at nuking, DS'ing, and buffing,
but I guess that's another subject entirely.  Not sure about the
healing, though; I hear shamans are pretty good at healing, but I'm
not sure how good compared to druids.  (I'm too lazy to look it up.)

I'm not disagreeing that he rolled his character primarily to be able
to teleport himself and others, I'm disagreeing that he has only
himself to blame.  Back when he started his druid, he couldn't
possibly have predicted that an expansion would eventually came out
that gave level 1 characters free teleports.

I think all you're showing here is that different people like
different things about their classes.  Your lack of enthusiam
about group teleports doesn't mean nobody else is enthusiastic
about them.

I interpret this to mean, "Only druids complain."  Of course, that

I responded to your request to find some proof that people have been

with 5 or 6 examples.

Don't worry, my skin is too thick for you or anyone else to
penetrate.  :)  That doesn't mean I'll stop pointing out that many
people in a.g.e are cranky and annoying "anti-whiners".

And wizards would be unaffected if every level one character got

And clerics would be unaffected if every level one character got
a right-click item with infinite charges of res.  Uh huh.

Etc, etc, etc.
