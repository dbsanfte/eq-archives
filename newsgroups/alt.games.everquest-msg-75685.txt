My Paladin (I'm sensing a pattern here) once got wedged
between the dock and the shuttles in Butcherblock and
simply COULD NOT get unstuck.  I resigned myself to
having to wait 30 minutes or so for the shuttles to
ship out (at which time I'd presumably just drop into
the water), when a fellow in a robe wandered by and
asked if I needed help.

I said yeah, and without a word I got a
challenge to a duel from him.  "Huh?", I asked, and
he said "trust me, accept".  So I did, he started casting
a spell, and the next thing I knew I got hit with
Gravity Flux and I'm flying through the air like a
dwarf-shaped football that's been punted hard.  I
made a soft landing in the water in the Butcherblock bay,
and after swimming back to the docks I thanked the
Wizard heartily.
