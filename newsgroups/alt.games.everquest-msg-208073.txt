Ok I got a 54 druid, cant find a descent place to hunt.  New record
lasted 30 seconds in CS.  Went to OOT sea furys (Not bitching) always
camped and of course being a druid we got a plague that people dont
like or want to group.  CS out of question.  Due to small mana pool I
tried raptors, did not die but close (Ported out in time)  I currently
hunt at Jagged Pine A little slow but some exp.  Any suggestions on
where a plague infested dru may hunt? LOL

Happy hunting
