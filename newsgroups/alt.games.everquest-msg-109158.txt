The evil Cleric armor quest that you get in the temple of innoruuk is
currently broken. Just get the items you need from nektulos and wait
till the patch says they are ready. The lead GM on the luclin server
said they would be fixed soon. By the way....those rodcet nife people
wandering around nektulos that you need to kill for the armor quest
give bad qeynos faction.....which means you gotta be careful porting
into NK and if you camp the spires in SK watch out for the wandering
guard.
