Nagafen's Lair might be a good option, groups always seem to be
looking for a healer, exp and loot are both good for 39. Lowest mobs
start greening around level 45, so you can hunt there for a while yet.
There are a couple camp sites close to the zone, so you can join a
pickup group for a short time easily. There are merchants in
Lavastorm, a gypsy camp and a Druid merchant. As for travel, it's not
too far from Freeport, and you can get a teleport to Lavastorm or
Nektulos.

The City of Mist is a good zone, similar loot and a chance at some
valuable drops, but pick up groups seem harder to find. It is also
more isolated, so it's harder to get to merchants or a bank. Too bad
really, I liked hunting there, but it's just too far from anything,
can't even port anywhere near. I seem to recall when my guild raided
we had to port to Dreadlands, then zone to Karnors, then evac to
Emerald Jungle, then travel to CoM. And that was the quick route.

Great Divide is another option, since you can get spell drops off the
Wurms. I only hunted here with some guild mates so I don't know how
tough pickup groups are to find, but since a bindable city is adjacent
there should be no shortage of melees looking for a Cleric to fill a
group.
