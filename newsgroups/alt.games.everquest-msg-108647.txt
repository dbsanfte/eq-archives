It's a necromancer damage shield, Banshee Aura, self only 8 min duration.
(SK's get it, but not til 54, necros at 16)

The reason you were having trouble dispelling it is probably because the
necro was buffing itself up and you had to chew through those buffs also
(plus the fact that "dispell magic" doesn't always remove a buff)
