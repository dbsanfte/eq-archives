-ability to travel via nexus through the wizard ports.
-ability to train special skills at 51+
-ability to get over 50 (get this with kuinark and velios too)
-the extra spells you can learn without sol

If you dont get it now, you will want it when you hit 51. You get to learn
innate movemenmt speed, and its a hell of a lot quicker than camping the ac,
not to mention its always with you (cr's). At 55 you get to learn mental
clarity.
Nuff said.
