I dunno...

The message I was trying to convey was along the lines of... "I have no
personal experience of this, but from people I have spoken to and the
various posts I've read on quest spoiler sites (ie: general opinion) gives
me the impression (ie: seems) that those people who have devoted time and
effort to an extensive set of quests involving some challenging encounters
geared around the mid-30s grouping levels are dissappointed with the end
rewards attained, feeling that there are comparable or, indeed, superior
items of equipment that require less expenditure of time and money to aquire
(ie: not worth the hassle)"

Now, I'll grant that reading all that makes me sound like some kind of
boring old fart, which is why I tried to use snappier and more direct
language.

My retort directed at Mr Day (who appears to only post from a contrarian
position to the most reasonable or witty comments made by others... aka
Troll) was on the basis that a person familiar with the use of a phrase such
as "don't presume" might actually have sufficient grasp of other nuances of
English usage to recognise the subtlety of the inclusion of words like
"seems".

On the other hand... and here, I'm borrowing an amusing analogy from a
recent topic... having decided that something as low-tech as a bow and arrow
is too complicated to master... the chimp has gone straight to using an Uzi
;o)

And no... you can't have my stuff :o)

ps... the above post was made without the assistance of any spell-checker,
grammar-checker, or punctuation proofing software. Stylisticly, it relies
too heavily on paranthesis... but otherwise, I believe it would stand up to
quite close examination as acceptable use of written language.
