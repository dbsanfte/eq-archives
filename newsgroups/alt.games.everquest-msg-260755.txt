There are plenty of Druids out,not hard to find one,I think
its because they can solo well and make valuable groupmembers.
True "they aren't best at anything",but they can port a group,
a very underrated ability I think,saves a lot of time especially
in Ldon when the adventure is finished;evac is nice too when
opening a door leads to getting the whole room.
I would take a Druid anytime I can get one,despite his healing
abilities are useless in a group with a Cleric(me).

You're right,Shamans are pretty rare,I think 50% of my Ldon pickups
I do with out any slower/haster.

Make a char on SolRo,look on the lfg list,Rangers are always
the highest count,maybe it differs from server to server.

Right,Beastlords are plenty,same reason like Druids,they can solo
well and make valuable group members.

I remember vaguely running *ONCE* from BB to Lfay,cause we had
no Sower,other than that I cannot think of a single group without
Sower.
So there are 3 very popular Sow classes and 1 harder to find - 
Sow classes are much easier to find than a slower/haster.
