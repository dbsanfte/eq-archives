Then you should know that the Freeport Militia (along with some
of the Qeynos guards) are corrupt and it's entirely *proper* to
kill them for good races and/or good classes.   And, even better,
that -- for an evil race/class -- killing guards is how they get enough
faction to bank in Freeport (which is controlled by "good" faction
guards.)  Or, better yet, that Paladins *must* kill the leader of the
Freeport Militia if they want their epic.

Guards that aren't meant to be killed aren't, in general.  True
newbie guards are high-level, buffed like crazy, and hit like a
ton of bricks.  The guards you're talking about are there because
they're *supposed* to be killed.  It's all faction-based.

For example, since you're a wood elf, wouldn't it be "in character"
for you to kill dark elf guards?  The roaming ones in Nektulos Forest
are low-level and pretty easy kills.   Don't try the ones at the gate
to Neriak, though.

In general, if VI doesn't want something killed, they make it so it's
not killed.  Go try to kill a Scion at the spires, for instance.  If it's
killable, it's meant to be killed, for some reason, loot and/or faction.
At some point if you level you'll probably end up killing "guards" for
the Velious Giant, Dragon, or Coldain factions, for instance.
