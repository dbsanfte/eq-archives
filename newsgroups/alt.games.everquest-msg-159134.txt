To get to the arena you pass several spawn points so as you run, you
will have to pass through these areas again likely they will have been
respawned plus the guards at the entrance. Throw in the bashing and
possible casting on you......

Smallest successful  and un eventful group I have heard of in the
arena is a single group but little room for error.
