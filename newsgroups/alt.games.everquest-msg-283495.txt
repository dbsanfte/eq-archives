I find that nearly every time I get interrupted its from a stun, not
just getting hit.  Of course part of that is that I am a kiter because
both of my casters are snarers.  If things go to hell I almost always
try to get some distance and cast a snare.  The interrupts come when I
cant get far enough away and of course that means that the first combat
round will include a bash.  But I also think that mobs bash more often
than they used to, on top of hitting faster.  Or maybe they land bashes
more often.
