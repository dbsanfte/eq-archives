This is just a matter of preference, some people prefer to work more 
slowly and then get multiple advances in quick order.

The reason that this is illogical is that it makes both occur somewhat 
later, rather than one soon and one much later... which sounds like what 
you said, but the difference is that getting an AA or a level will make 
getting exp easier, so that "soon + much later" = 1.5 later while "both 
somewhat later = 2 later.

That is assuming, of course, that getting that AA point is actually 
going to improve your character to the point where he'll get exp faster. 
  Many AA points just get saved up towards a more expensive goal; those 
AA points won't help you exp faster unless you've saved enough for that 
goal.  Many AA abilities don't help you get exp faster anyway; perhaps 
they are tradeskill AA or something like that.

However, I think for most people, run 1, 2, and 3 fall into the helpful 
category, and for many, regen 1, 2, 3 also fall into that category.

Levels, in my experience, almost always fall into that category, 
exceptions being up past 62 when they can actually reduce exp for 
soloers, who find most of the mobs they can profitably solo turning cyan 
on them.
