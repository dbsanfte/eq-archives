At early 40's they are very tough, they hit fast and hard and hit in the
60's to 80's. They spawn in twos at the foot of the 4 structures sticking
out of the water. There are also 4 spawn points at front of temple with a
fifth spawn which is the marauder who is very tough. What we do is this.
Druid levitates. Walk out to first spawn point. Swim down till first gill is
in range and pull with snare or whatever you feel best. Then swim up and
levitate back to shore. The bloodgill swims to you but not as fast as sowed
levitate. Wait a little back from shore and it will run to you. You will
probably pull each pair because of aggro so as the druid is waiting he keeps
clicking root and it will cast as soon as in range and so will park one.
Then kill the other leaving the other waiting for death. For this reason I
made a good puller as a chanter, Illusion air, pull and when back at shore
mez the first.

They really are good exp and they only have between 1200 and 1400hp. So good
in fact that I use them to power level anyone that can group with me and
receive exp. I just kill kill kill and let htem soak up the exp.

At your level you could get a group of 6 and still get half blue bub per
kill.
