Allow me to give a different perspective.  My guild's usual raid leader does
no significant research; he'll look at the BS on Allakhazam and talk to one
or two people he knows from an uberguild and assume he knows all there is to
know about an encounter.  Since I joined this guild two, almost three months
ago, they have managed exactly THREE new encounters successfully - Xana,
Protos, and last night's Desert Lord.  Four group raid, average level 62,
and this is the best they can do.  I've lost count of how many wipes we had
doing Xanamech - and there's no excuse for any of them.  (My prior guild,
which sadly disintegrated, did Xana with two-thirds the forces, lower
levels, and no deaths.)  And these people call themselves a raid guild.

The purpose of research before a raid isn't to get a color-by-numbers guide
to killing a mob.  It's to get the information necessary to form a
successful strategy.  Any successful raid has three elements - mob,
environment, and raid force.  You can't formulate a strategy without knowing
all three.
