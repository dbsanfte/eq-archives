I've never seen Graeme mis-speak, and he's corrected several errors I've
made.  SRM has made several comments that are so wrong that even I can see
they're goofy (and I don't play a shaman or a rogue or a monk).  Sorry, SRM,
I'm behind Graeme on this one.

Learn some new tactics.  I've duo'd in PoN just fine with a ranger; ranger
snared, I aggroed and ran the birdie around while the ranger filled it with
arrows (good old EQ/AM3).  You don't HAVE to tank.
