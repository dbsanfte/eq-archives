Offense is actually one of the easiest skills to max when PL'ing with
a DS.  Every hit on it is a chance to get a raise in Offense as well as
Defense.  Up until the low 40's, char's I've PL'd have max or near max
offense and defense.  At 43 it changes, however, as the fastest method
for me to level a char is to simply group them and eat mobs at the fastest
possible rate. 

Also, defense is easily fixed, as are weapon's skills - just need
a pet class and a healer for a few hours (getting to 200 is easy, but
skillups slow way down after 200, even with near 280 dex).
