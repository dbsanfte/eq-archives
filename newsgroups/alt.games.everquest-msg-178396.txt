Jagged Blade of Mourning (13/25 3ac 10dex) doesn't have the gaudy stats,
but it's as cheap or cheaper than GJBS and typically half the cost of
a Centi LS (can often be found at or under 1kpp, of course your server
might have different prices).  It's a fairly decent off-hand, probably
a wash with the Centi LS for off-hand damage output as its marginally
better ratio is offsets the Centi's str boost (and the JBoM will
definitely outdamage the Centi in main hand because it's faster and so
gets more benefit from your main-hand damage bonus).

It depends on your level (and whether you want agro).  What makes faster
better in your main hand is the level-based damage bonus:  (L-25)/3 for
1-handers, the same thing that has a Lamentation (9/19) outdamaging a
Wurmslayer (25/40) once you get to the mid-50s or so.
