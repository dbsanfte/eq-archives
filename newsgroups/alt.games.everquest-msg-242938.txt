}i wouldn't bother with the Concordance. Most of the practice rune 
}recipes have been broken for years.

My only experience with it is about 2 years ago, but all the recipes were 
working.  The fact that they were, for a long time,  misreported and 
misinterpreted on mythiran.allakhazam.com (one of the most widely known 
sites for research) is another matter. :) Apparently the author didn't 
believe froglok eyes and ... some other thing ... were real.  I see that 
it's fixed now, though.

That said, it's still a colossal waste of time.  Just spend points at the 
trainer, or collect a huge number of words off merchants to practice on.  
You'll get there a lot faster than you will trying to farm froglok eyes 
and stuff.
