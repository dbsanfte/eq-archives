    Last time I was in permafrost, I was attempting to retrieve a warrior's
corpse from some sort of pit trap, and was repeatedly booted out of the zone
by Vox.

    Being that almost all of our 50's characters, including every single
tank now, is above 52, I don't see naggy or vox as viable targets :(

    [snip solid info on NToV - thanks :)]

    [snip my silly NToV questions and your sensible answers]

    Solid stuff! I now have a bookmarked link to someone's Tier List that
has links for each raid target that go to illia's bestiary. Thanks for that
input!

    I've noticed that a lot of the tier 1 raid targets have been done by
single groups and less these days. I'm hoping this means they will be
significantly easier for my guild to do than a guild at the same stage a
year ago etc.
