Animals are "dumb" and they act on instinct. They are incapable of
making the decision NOT to reproduce. 5 years ago my home was
burglarized while my wife and I were at work. Our front door was wide
open (kicked in) for hours, and our in-door only cats were exposed to
the neighbor hood cats that claim our yards as their own . I know for
a fact that at least one or two of those neighborhood cats stopped in
for a snack and to mark new territory.  I have no way of knowing if
our cats were exposed to any feline diseases, but there was no
possibilty that either of them could have reproduced with the cats in
the neighborhood because they had both been "fixed".

No matter how "responsible" a pet owner is, it is impossible to
guarantee that you cat/dog won't get out of the house/yard from time
to time or come into contact with another animal when you are not
home. You are nuts if you think a "responsible pet owner"
spays/neuters to serve their own convenience.
