I havent played my enchanter in well over a year now, except to buy
stuff for my ogre.  I feel like playing him again, but i have long
since sold of his gear, and am looking for pointers as to what i
should get.  

I know i used to have a savants cap, black iron medallion, oracle
robe, stein of moggok....i think the rest was silk armor i made, and
jewelry i made.  I have about 2000pp to spend to outfit this guy, if
you wanna give any pointers, feel free to post a reply.

thanks, 
  chuck
