My specialize alteration skill is stuck at 50, the other specialize skills
are all zero. I'm a lv 39 frog shaman and my other characters all got to 51
upon turning lv30

The difference is that I gave training points to the skill at lv37, it
suddenly jumped to 37 and I quickly trained it up to 50, but it has
remained stuck there. I have not given any training points to the other
specialize skills and they still remain at zero.

I petitioned it and was told that it was random and to be patient, but I
have spent over 10 hours practicing magic and it still does not go up past
50.. all my regular magic skills are maxed out for my level 190-200 or so.
The GM did place a bug report

I am worried, a very important part of a shaman in a group is slow and
haste.. both of them are alteration type magic.

I really would hate to ditch the frog and start leveling up my ogre shaman
(lv25).

Some people recommend I put a training point in the other specialize
skills, but I'm worried it will shoot up past 50 and then I'm really stuck.

Advice please..
