    Hm...  Well, not too sure what the main thrust of your post is, but I
gotta wonder about this part.  Yes, there are sucky guilds and players, but
there are plenty of good ones to.  If you were able to find groups of
people that were acceptable in the past, why can you not do so now?  If you
want to make online hunting buddies, perhaps you try a few pick up groups. 
I do them all the time, and yes, I do end up grouped with idiots.  I also
end up with people on my friends list.

  /shrug Dunno how sociable you are, but I find that being competent and
well, nice to people will get you plenty of company in the game.  Course,
if that isn't an option, then I guess building your own group of bots is
certainly on option.
