Hey Zui,

  As you well know you have alot of responses from this group.  I build
computers on the side, and most here know about computers.  I don't feel you
video card is the problem.  You really need to look at 2 things.  Your ram
doesn't met there recommened amount.  So you need to upgrade the ram.  Also,
what kind of connection do you have to the internet is also another.  Slower
connections will lag when performance issues are pushed so to speak.

I am running EQ on an old Pentium 450 with 512 megs of ram, Tornado 4 64 meg
ddr video, and cable connection, I only lag in the Bazarr so far...its nuts
there...hahaha.

Just cause I build em for others, doesn't mean I can afford one for
me...hahahaha
