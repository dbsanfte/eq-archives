I was curious about this remark, especially since I was on the verge
of buying some DoN augments for mana/HP regen (having finally made it
to the minimum level required for those items!).  So I went off and
searched the SOE forums and found the threads in which the devs list
these and other upcoming changes.  The threads say that they're aiming
to have the changes come out at the same time as Serpent's Spine, but
the changes will be included for everyone (i.e., you don't have to buy
SS to get the regen improvements).

Here are links to the threads on the forums, but I'll also copy the
first message from each thread so folks here can see the summaries of
the coming changes without having to go over there.

Other changes:        http://tinyurl.com/gols2

I'll start with the other changes message since those items are shorter:

========================================================================

In addition to the upcoming launch of The Serpent's Spine, we are working
on a number of improvements to EverQuest at the same time.  I wanted to
give everyone else a head's up on some of the changes that are coming your
way.  These changes are still undergoing testing so may change before they
go live.  We are attempting to get these out in the same patch that
introduces The Serpent's Spine, but they are not part of the expansion and
if deemed necessary, may be introduced at a later date.

AA System -- With the increase to level 75, we've run into a problem with
AAs.  AAs are built around a static amount of experience, roughly what is
required to get level 51.  As levels have gone up, the amount of experience
you get for killing a creature goes up too and we're at the point now where
a few kills at level 75 would be worth an AA point.  To avoid this problem
and the problems associated with continually inflating AA costs to
compensate, we're moving the AA system to a more relative system so the
amount of AA experience you gain will be based on the difficulty (con
level) of the NPC you killed rather than its level (quest XP and other ways
of getting AA are likewise converted over to the new system).  The amount
of experience required to get an AA is based around what a level 70 player
currently requires in the old system, so players at level 70 shouldn't see
much difference.  Players below level 70 will gain AA at a faster rate than
before the change because they were previously gaining at a much slower
rate than a level 70 can.

Spell Resists -- We'll be introducing a new spell resist formula that will
make spell resists much more lenient than they have been in the past.  The
old system was built for the original game when the levels were capped at
50 and the resists were under 300.  It wasn't built to be very flexible and
as the levels have gone up and the resists have gone up, it has maintained
the same narrow range of values that meant a spell was unresisted as it had
back then.  In a good system, appropriate level spells should land most of
the time, but not all of the time, against appropriate level NPCs.  Because
of the narrow range on the older system, that isn't the case currently.
Most spells these days tend to be all-or-nother.  They either land or they
don't and you don't see much deviation from that.  The new system
introduces a formula that scales a lot better and will result in more
spells falling into the right realm where spells can land, but don't always
land.

Death -- We'll be changing death so that when you die, you will be
"hovering" over your body and can choose to stay that way while waiting for
a resurrection instead of immediately zoning to your bind point.  This is
being done to help players on slow connections who take a big hit from
having to zone twice when they die.

Character Creation -- We've changed character creation to make it more
graphical, allow characters to be created from a single page, and update it
to include features associated with the new Drakkin race.  As part of this,
we've set up some character defaults so starting point allocation, starting
city, and starting deity all have defaults now which can be changed if you
wish.

Endless Quiver -- A longstanding issue we've had with ranger itemization is
the inability to create specialized arrows because they are never expended
due to the Endless Quiver AA.  This has led to arrows become a bit stale
over the years.  To resolve this issue, we've introduced the ability to
create new arrows that are not affected by Endless Quiver.  These arrows
will specifically be marked as "Expendable".  It's important to note that
old arrows will not change and we will continue to create new arrows that
work with Endless Quiver.  This just allows us the flexibility to create
arrows that have a big effect without the balance issues associated with
them sticking around forever.

Dark Blue Con -- The concept of a dark blue con NPC has existed in EQ for a
while now.  It represents a range of blue con NPCs that give a bonus to
their experience due to being very close to your level, generally within 5
levels.  We've decided to change the con system to include this range as
well so you can visually see when an NPC falls into this "sweet spot".

========================================================================

In addition to the upcoming launch of The Serpent's Spine, we are working
on a number of improvements to EverQuest at the same time.  I wanted to
give everyone else a head's up on some of the changes that are coming your
way.  These changes are still undergoing testing so may change before they
go live.  We are attempting to get these out in the same patch that
introduces The Serpent's Spine, but they are not part of the expansion and
if deemed necessary, may be introduced at a later date.  Due to the size of
the post, this one is specific to downtime changes.

Likely the biggest change we are making is one aimed at reducing the amount
of downtime in EverQuest.  As EverQuest has grown over the years, the
amount of downtime imposed upon players has grown as well and we'd rather
players find challenge in the fights themselves than in the tedium between
them.  Toward that end, we've created a new system that is simple to use,
but powerful and flexible enough to control downtime as the game continues
to grow.

The basics of the new system are relatively simple.  Once you have been
out-of-combat for a sufficient amount of time, you can sit down (or be on a
non-moving horse) and begin to rest.  While resting, you enter an
accelerated regeneration state that will quickly recover your mana, health,
and endurance.  For most single group content, once you are out of combat
for 30 seconds you can rest.  While dealing with multi-group content, that
time is 5 minutes.  The amount of time you have to be out-of-combat before
you can rest varies for group content and raid content due to the different
needs of the different encounter types.

There are a series of icons that will display by your character's name to
let you know what your character's current state is.

Crossed Swords -- You are currently in-combat.

Hour Glass -- You are out of combat, but not yet in a resting state.  In
addition to the hourglass, there is a timer bar beneath the endurance bar
that will count down as you get closer to being rested.

Poison Drop -- You are no longer in combat, but cannot rest because of a
debuff that is affecting you.  You must get rid of the debuff before you
can rest.

Void -- The void is the default icon and indicates that you are not
in-combat and you can rest at any time.

Energy Swirl -- The energy swirl indicates that you are currently resting.

That is pretty much all you need to know to make full use of the new system
when it goes live, but for those of you interested in the behind-the-scenes
details, here is how the system works.

The system is based around you being in one of two states at all times:
in-combat or out-of-combat.  Being in-combat is defined by being on the
hate list of any creature in the zone.  To prevent problems with being
stuck in a combat state due to some creature on the other side of the zone
hating you because you ran past it 15 minutes ago, creatures will remove
you from their hate list if you get far enough away from them that they no
longer care about you and remain that way for more than 30 seconds.

Every NPC in the game has a rest timer associated with it.  When you enter
combat with a creature, you will gain their rest timer if it is greater
than any rest timer you currently have on you.  Once you are no longer in a
combat state, that timer will begin to count down.  The rest timer varies
depending on the difficulty of the encounter you are fighting.  For most
creatures, the rest timer is 30 seconds but for multi-group content
(defined by the initial intention of the content) the rest timer is 5
minutes.  This difference is included to prevent potential exploits
associated with classes that can drop hate at will (fading memories, evacs,
etc.).  In a raid situation where fights can last for quite a while, this
could easily be abused.  Rest timers are persistent through zoning and
logging out, but are cleared upon death (the death debuff itself, though,
keeps you from being able to rest until it is gone).  NPCs that give the
extended rest timer will have extra text in their con message that denotes
them as a multi-group encounter so you can know ahead of time that they
will give you the longer rest timer.

There are a few special cases that we included to ensure we're covering any
potential loopholes.

    * If you buff, heal, or otherwise positively interact with a player who
      has an active rest timer, you will inherit their timer if it is
      greater than the one you currently have.

    * If you attack (or are attacked by) another player in a pvp setting,
      you will gain a 30 second rest timer.

    * If you have a debuff on yourself, you cannot rest even if you do not
      have a rest timer on yourself.  Certain debuffs can be flagged to not
      impact your ability to rest if needed.  Those debuffs will have a
      yellow border instead of a red one on their buff icon.

    * If you are attacked, you gain the rest timer of the creature
      attacking you.  The exception is if this is self-inflicted damage.
      Self-inflicted damage does not incur a rest timer.

Resting regeneration is percentage-based regeneration for health, mana, and
endurance and is currently set to take you from 0 to full in 3 minutes.
This allows it to scale with gear, so you aren't penalized for getting
better gear, and ensures that downtime never becomes a problem again as the
game continues to grow.  This system replaces the older advanced
regeneration that was introduced for health.

Rashere

========================================================================

p.s. by Don: Later posts seem to indicate that this "percentage-based
regeneration" is NOT affected by regen items and buffs; i.e., once you
achieve the resting state, your HP/mana will come back at the percentage
rate designed to restore 100% in 3 minutes.  (Not clear if this is a
constant rate or whether it ramps up like the current health regen that's
being replaced.)

Rashere mentions that the goal is to make it still be more efficient to
manage your HP/mana so as to be killing continuously, but to use this
new scheme to provide an upper bound on downtime.

One other specific comment I saw partway through the thread is that they
are looking at ways to keep Bind Wounds and its associated AAs relevant
in the face of these changes; one idea mentioned was to allow high Bind
Wounds skill (and/or AAs) to cure poison and disease.
