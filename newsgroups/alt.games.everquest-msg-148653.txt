Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt
Damage 30
Delay 38
Range 250
STR 5
AGI 5
DEX 5
WIS 5
HP 50
Mana 50
Sv fire/cold/magic 10

Blessed Champion Arrow
Damage 11
Delay 0
Range 170
Fire damage 4

Range when using those arrows with that bow is 420.

Fun stuff, particularly combined with Ranger disciplines.  Both arrows and
bow are only usable by Tunare worshiping bow classes.

Last night, I smithed the alloy rods, and a fellow guildie made 2 out of 3
of those bows.  One for a ranger in guild that has been drooling over them
ever since he heard about them, and one to sell to cover the fletching
costs.  Alas, the only arrows I had to offer him were Condensed Shadow ones,
Damage 10, Magic damage 4, Range 150.
