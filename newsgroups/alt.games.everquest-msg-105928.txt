Location:    Timorous Deep, Spiroc Treehouse.
Chimp:    One mana bubble, Liched down to 1 bubble of health, JBoot buff
fallen.
Gimp:    Aug'd Regular Warrior Pet, around half health.
Spiroc Lightbringer:    Feared and DoT'd to hell, on the deathmarch with a
severe double attack, dual weilding Gimp suppository... but itching to Lay
Hands.
Guest:    A_Git_drOOd, making a return performance from the weekend.
Trailing only 4 birds this time.


*A_Git_drOOd sees his arch-nemises: "A_Static_Camper" infringing on his
Karana given right to multi kite <all> the spirocs but also foolishly
falling low on HP. Hah! Retribution is at hand! Let's see how he likes this
Posse*

Gimp:    "Incoming drOOd  Train Oh <mumbles> One! When are you going to buy
me that Feign Death spell again Master?"

Chimp:    "Soon, I promise.... *coughs*"

Sure enough, Chimps low health bar draws aggro but is unwilling to play the
feign game again. Chimp right clicks his Jboots then Fears one of Spirocs.
Strafes back/sideways till fear is recastable and then proceeds to fear the
next one. Gimp manages to finish off the Lightbringer, breathing a sigh of
relief that fear held out preventing it from Laying Hands. Chimp Fears the
3rd Spiroc whilst A_Git_Druid madly nukes the last one realising this isn't
going as planned and is going to get messy.

Gimp:    *golf claps*

Chimp:    *begins to cast gate before the fears break*

Gimp:     *grin evaporates instantly* "Bugger....."

Chimp:    *successfully gates into Nexus and grins evilly*.

*You have Died.... Loading Please wait....*

Chimp:    *grin evaporates instantly* "Bugger....."


Liched again....
