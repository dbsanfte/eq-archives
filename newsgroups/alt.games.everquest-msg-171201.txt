I agree, they are the basis of our laws.  However, not all of the are
appropriate for our time and out nation.  While the prohibition against
murder, theft, and adultery are certainly appropriate (though adultery
should probably come under contract law, not criminal law), the part about
"Thou shalt have no god before me" doesn't fit into our legal and
constitutional framework.
