I only play LDoN with my primary character, he is level 65.  I can
assure you good gear (and some AAs) make a huge difference at this
level.

Recent example.  Assassinate mission, normal difficulty, Mistmoore.
All people from my ex-guild with varying amount of AAs (30-300+) and
well geared except for the 61 Ranger who started over after retiring
his 65 Warrior.

Ranger (65) [Me]
Ranger (65)
Ranger (61)
Cleric (65)
Warrior (65)
Mage (65)

Warrior was slowing with Willsapper, for the last 20 mins of the
mission we had no spell haste.  I think we had KEI for the duration,
not 100% sure and yet we won with 25 minutes to spare despite two
completely wrong turns and the Cleric going LD twice.

Mana was never an issue, never came close to losing anyone (even when
I was main healer, heh.)  Why did this ragtag group do so well?  Raid
gear.
