from what i understand, no you can't.  But the danger of power leveling is
that you don't learn you skills and basic tactics..Not suggesting you don't.
Just an understanding i have.  I do know that skills do not improve with
anything that is "green" to ya, so killing lots of yard trash by kicking
won't help.   Not sure what level your char is.  but my first warrior i
didn't know about kick at level 11 i found out and started the skill and it
is all good now. but was slow going at first.
