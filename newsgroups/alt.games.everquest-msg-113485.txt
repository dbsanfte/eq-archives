Sucks they didn't let you keep Mcjagger... that's sorta retarded. lol
We're thinkin about going to the concert up here, too.  I mean, hell.  Who
knows, this could be their last tour (knock on wood)... and I sure as hell
don't wanna tell my kids (when they're old enough to comprehend good music)
I never got to see 'em in concert...

So, do you live in boston?
Hubby is from there.
he misses the east coast, but I was born n raised in Seattle/WA, so we're
not sure when we'll venture out there.
