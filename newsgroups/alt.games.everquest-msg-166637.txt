You'll have to tell me the story of Rubicite, I don't know it.  But
unless it's an item that can only be given by a GM, it's still
infinite.

To reference GM-only items I would say this: this system of GM's
giving out items that don't exist anywhere else in game is not
reflective of a feudal system either.  No king can turn water into
wine, obvious biblical reference not withstanding.
