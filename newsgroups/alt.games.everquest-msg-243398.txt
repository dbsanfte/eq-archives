The message that comes up on the screen when you die from things like
falling is "You feel bogus as an unknown spell accosts you." I have become
fairly familiar with this text, as I have been stuck under the world and
ejected out into the sky three separate occaisions since all the dx9 stuff
came about. Fell for 20k. Felt totally bogus. But I also got a CS Res each
time. Excellent!
