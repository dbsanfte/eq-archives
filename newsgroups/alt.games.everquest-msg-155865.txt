This could be a heat problem. I have experienced the same problems, crashing
to desktop after a few minutes of playing on a new installed system. So
you're not going LD, EQ just crashes. It turned out my CPU (XP 1000) was
about 68 degrees Celsius at the moment of crashing and the mainboard about
34.

What worked for me, was removing the case of my computer. No heat problems
anymore.
