Mudflation is great. How many of us do you think would still be
playing if the top end of the game gave Nagafen and Hate-level gear?
If the top of the game were level 50 with no AAs?

Mudflation is a function of higher-end content. It is also a
facilitator of a top-heavy game where more than half the players (IME)
have one or more characters over level 60. If I'd been stuck with the
choice of playing my necro or spending another year getting a second
character to 55 before I could play with my friends again, I would
have quit a long time ago.

Players being able to rush through the low levels is a good thing in a
game that is increasingly being targeted at the top levels. That EQ
would change over time was a foregone conclusion. Trying to fight it
would have just been the end of EverQuest.

MUDflation happens whether you keep adding higher-end gear or not. As
long as there is something better than what you can buy to be had,
there are reasons for advancing in the game.
