I'm a high elf wizard.  Those guards at the orc lift always looked on me
friendly, but they wouldn't raise a finger against an arborean.  I think it
has to do with the fact that they live in trees, so they just like the trees
better than me.

Oh, sure, I know that now.   Back then I wasn't so smart.  OTOH, isn't it
considered rather impolite to kite through a crowd.  Of course, it's not
real polite to train through a crowd, but the guards are supposed to take
care of that sort of stuff.  Except for that tree hugger thing. ;-)

I did manage to get to the lift once and escape.  I then stood at the edge
of the platform and watched some other players take out the tree.  Trees
with roots - OK.  Moving trees - Grrrrr!

Cheers,
Eric
