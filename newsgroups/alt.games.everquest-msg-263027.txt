Ok, you're the cleric.

When do you want to find out how many HP and AC the tank in your group has?
Before or after the first mob arrives?

You know what you can do, your friends and guild mates know what you can
do, and people who have already grouped with you know what you can do.

The group wondering about taking you on have decided that need to get a
tank with X HP and Y AC before they're comfortable, no other way of finding
out.
