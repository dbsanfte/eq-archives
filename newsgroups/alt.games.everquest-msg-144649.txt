Well that glanced around the point I really tried to make, but since
you're not the first to mistake what I meant I suppose I put it badly.
I simply meant, then and now, that once PoP is out there will be
nothing else new *added* to EQ. So, what you've got is all you're
going to get.

After that, the EQ system, world, and mechanics will have been taken
as far as they possibly can. Essentially, beaten to death.
