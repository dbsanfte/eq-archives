I don't know if there's a heal UI, but Decursive is a debuff UI addon
that works exactly that way.  If you are in a raid, it displays who
has debuffs (poision, disease, magic, etc) that you can disperse, and
all you have to do to cast the right spell on the right person is
press one key.  I suspect there's a similar addon for heals but I've
never used it.

What I'm hoping is that Blizzard preserves the ability to *see* and to
*target* who needs to be cured, but that it's still up to the priest /
druid to target the person and do the right thing.
