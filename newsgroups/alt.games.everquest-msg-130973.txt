Slightly OT but it affects EQ so what the hell..

My comp keeps freezing while the HD thrashes away regardless of what I'm doing.
Duting EQ these freeze ups can last up to 30 seconds, which is usually fatal if I'm
leveling.
Even sitting at desktop with nothing running it will launch into severe fits and the
task manager really only shows that it's being taxed, and not what is doing it. I
have a feeling it is the cache (I'm no techie) emptying, so can anyone offer some
advice as to make this less frequent or less intensive? I have some meagre windows
savvy so I am able to use Xsetup to adjust cache size and location etc if need be.
At the moment its on a partitioned 2nd drive (tons of room and on root drive also),
and Im running winXP 256 mb ram PIII 733.

TIA for any suggestions.

Zuit
