Well, it's rare that we such incompetence displayed by someone who
started off with a tirade, then went on to tell others how they should
play their characters and how EQ should be played.

It's our duty to correct people who cry buckets over "wasted" mana,
when really they're too stupid to press the "D" key.

It's our duty to correct people who (supposedly) have a Necro, yet
don't know that Necromancers can rez.

We try to improve the player-base, you see  :)  With you, it will take
a while.
