I would suggest that only the main tank, the main assist and the enchanter
(if there is one, and depending on where you're hunting) get symbols, and of
course yourself.  no one else needs it because those three (four) are the
ones most likely to take a pounding.  If you have a Shaman in the group, let
them cast their Talisman line on the others as well as the stamina line
(Health, etc.) Or let the druid cast their skin of xxxxx on the others.
