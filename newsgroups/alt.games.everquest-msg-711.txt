Bullshit alert.  I go after things that con even or or
yellow to me at every opportunity.  I do this in high
traffic areas that add greatly to the risk factor so for you
to make a blanket statement like this has no bearing in real
life.

Your groups must suck.  I {almost} never die grouping but
have often died solo.  But be that  as it may, nobody was
bitching about "not getting a bonus for solo play" at least
not that I have read here.  The point was to express concern
that Verant would lean things to far to grouping and take
the solo aspect out of it completely.  It is my guess that
most serious players of this game have more than one
charater (I know I do) and want to be able to continueally
play each in the style they created it for and to be able to
advance each at a comparable rate (again I know I do).

Grouping is basically a  repatative system too.  Each member
has his/her role in a group from beginning to end (rinse
then repeat).  But that aside, your self admitted fact that
you die often while grouping says you just aren't as good as
you claim.

I paly both Group and Solo with my Necro and my Warrior and
my Druid (soon to have a Shaman too).  But I am under time
constraints more often than not.  This leaves me only 30
minutes of game play on many days and a top end of 3 hours.
For those 3 hour days I group and never have trouble finding
people to group with because I also know what I am doing and
don't myself or any of my group members killed.

But since we seem to have to separate camps here and neither
will give any ground nor admit the other has many sound and
valid points that brings this entire thread to an end for
me.  I wish you much luck in your game play and success in
life.
