They take a little practice to control.  Be patient.

As a chanter/necro pair, I would say your chanter friend should be more
concerned about not crossing *your* path /assist-wise until you get a better
leash on the pet.

Hmm...are you /assisting your friend during this?  I don't know why this
would happen but I've seen it before.  The first character I started was a
necro that I got to level 26, then gave up on because being the first
character I made, the stats were hosed.  Eventually I made another necro.
Oops, I'm trailing off...anyway, even with first necro, this problem
eventually "went away".  I assume I finally got the hang of controlling it
but not really sure what I ever did differently.  That's why I say stick
with it, it will come to you.

Not bad, but you can ditch Dark Empathy if no-one other than the pet is
really taking a beating.  I rarely use it myself, but yes it does have some
uses.

lol, get used to it.

Even more frustrating than that (especially before you have good reins on
your pet) is being in a dungeon, then realizing "Where did my skellie go?"
/shout TRAIN!!!
One time in BlackBurrow I lost a pet.  I just sat down on the bridge and
waited and waited and waited, determined not to kill it, but to see what
mayhem might come high-tailing it towards me (zone was actually empty save
for me, so no deaths other than my own could ensue).  Oddly enough, even
with all spawns in their place my pet came from the water under the bridges
that lead to the Elite ledge, walked right through some scrawnies and
patrollers without drawing aggro and met me at the bridge.  That was like
1/2 hour later almost.  I would LOVE to know exactly where it went.  Sadly,
it will remain a mystery.

Keep with it!  Necros are cool!

Sean...
