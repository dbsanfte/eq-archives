I'm a 53 clr on Rathe-I do mostly pick-up groups and rarely have
trouble getting one, I always keep my group in buffs/heals ect.,  with
the exception of the money costing symbols-- In my experiance;
1) about 5% of groups I'm in (as a whole) make sure i get reimbursed
for my dots (specifically giving pp or extra loot to compensate)-in
otherwords, its  a very very rare, pleasent suprise
2) maybe 5 to 10% of peeps that specifically ask for symbol buff in
group provide the pp or gem for it-
3) about 50% of the peeps in the group dont mention symbol, one way or
other
4)90ish % that ask for sybol buff appear to expect it for free, they
never offer to reimburse and many get snotty about it
5) whenever asked for one , I often say that I'm out of the stones,
but will be glad to cast if they give me on-interestingly-about 10-15%
seem to be genuinly suprised (perhaps they forgot?) that it costs
pp/ingrediant to cast and they go get a stack to give me for group
6) I generally find that there are more rude/selfish players than
there used to be-I read some elses explanation and it kinda made sense
to me, i will paraphrase it ( adding my own perspective no doubt)
7) there appear to be 2 general types of players playing;
a) the kind that realize that all the other pc's have real people
behind them, and try to act in a kind, positive or at least neutral
manner
b) the kind that treat everyone else as if they were npc's and not
real people, whose sole reason for existance was to help them or
provide amusement, regardless of cost or trouble to the others-they
dont seem to realize, or care that everyone else playing has needs,
rights or plans ect. -these players are extreamly self centred,
ego-centric and immature(not nessessarily in age btw, emotional and
psychological immaturity is the key ) with all sorts of
unrealistic/unfair expectations for others, with little or no
corresponding expectations on themselves
8) not sure why there seems to be more, all I know is its a real
pleasure and bit of a suprise when I find a friendly, happy,
competent, strong, fair share, loyal group-I often find individuals
like that, but usually 1 or 2 jerks per group-sorta like real life I
guess (imagine that :)
9) if the various percentages I've used dont add up to 100%, or hold
some other flaw, its because   
1)they are off the top of my head just to make a point
2)I aint the anal retentive/hyper detail type  :)
