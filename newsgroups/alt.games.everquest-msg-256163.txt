I think this is a *very* good idea. However, I'd also have to consider 
dropping the duration as you drop down in levels. Otherwise KEI on a 
22nd is still orders of magnitude better than clarity etc... to the 
point that there would be no reason to use clarity.

Suddenly a 44th level cleric doesn't want a 43rd level tank, it creates 
definate lines in your leveling. Its not all bad, but there are issues 
with it. And some classes get spells at different levels, though i 
suppose you could use the lowest level as the limit.

It would be fun to see the whiners bitch that temperance, regen, and 
damage shields slows down their power leveling though. God forbid they 
actually play their characters. :p
