Look at the bright side -- you already have the
email addresses of the folks who have the power
to fix it, who know what you're talking about,
and they know that you're not just some newbie
whining about normal in-game faction changes.

It's likely that you could get it fixed pretty
fast this time by telling them, "remember last time?
It happened again".

I'd give it a shot if I were you.
