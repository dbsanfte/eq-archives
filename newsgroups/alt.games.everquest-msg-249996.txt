I ran into that problem recently also, and I've done LOTS of fishing
from that dock.  I tried lots of positions, including very close to
the edge of the dock, and facing various ways; could not get it to
work.  I know it didn't used to be so hard, so I /bugged it.

I don't know how it got broken; maybe the new collision fixes are
making it fussier about the edge of the dock?

For now, what I'm doing to deal with it is using the Magus upstairs to
port me to Natimbi; fishing from the landing there works and brings in
the same stuff.  Not as convenient to the bank etc., of course, but it
was okay.
