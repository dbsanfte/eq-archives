Very probably they specifically removed whatever code was in the
system to make it 95 compatible. Which is a good thing for everyone
else, because it means a sleeker, less bug-prone system.

Cash grab may be part of it, but there are other things to consider.
Supporting old operating systems *costs* money. The problem only grows
worse over time, as the people who are still running the old OS often
still want to run the newest software. Retrofitting new features into
very old OS's is simply a terrible waste of effort.

And of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with a cash grab. The
whole point of being in business is to make money, after all.

Huh? No, not hardly. 95 is terribly out of date, especially measured
by computer time. It's time to let it die.
