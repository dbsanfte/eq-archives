would help if we knew what expansion you have/don't have.

suggestions though:

Jaggedpine forest.

Cobat Scar (make SURE your Claws of Veeshan faction is good though - go kill
giants in GD/EW/Kael)

Jaggedpine is GREAT for a druid.  Wolf form up and nothing but the poachers,
gnolls and potameids will aggro you.  creatures are non-social (wisps are I
think, and poachers definitely are, but have a small aggro radius).  The
potameids are only a problem if you go near water.  and they are casters.
wolf form also sets your party members to indifferent with the local
wildlife.
