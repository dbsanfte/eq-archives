    I got the AoE "wow" later, when kobolds came to zone. Amazing how
quickly Upheaval + The Unspoken Word clears the zoneline! Except for those
new kobolds in the King area, for the Jaggedpine quest - found out at least
one of them is 100% MR. Had to kill it later using melee and my hammer pet,
just to prove I could! ;-)

    The FGs are farmed to death anyways. King drops a nice crown, and the
magi drops an excellent INT caster shield.

    You don't always have to intend to sell the item to mention that it's
worth a ton of cash. Just like when some people in my guild win good loot
and say "OMG, I bet my E-Bay value just went up $50!!" They don't really
intend to sell their characters. We hope.

    Not the one for x-loc to bind, anyways. It might have just been a bored
wizard auto-x-locing everyone out, but it sure was funny. Especially since
most of our wizards showed up for this raid after skipping a bunch of raids
where lots of non-wizard loot drops. Get out the Coppertone, Team Sunshine
inc!
