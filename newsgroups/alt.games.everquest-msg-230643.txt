I like my hammer. I'd been waiting weeks for Bert to drop the ring and
it dropped last week and went to a druid with better loot faction. Oh
well, hopefully mine will build up again before the next ring drops,
though the Quarm neck is gonna put a big dent in it.

Back on topic though, no, our guild doesn't currently have these issues
that I see. We've had good enough retention that we haven't had to
recruit many new people for several months now, and part of our
recruitment is a discussion on each recruit where enough negative
comments can sink their chance of joining. However, with a Time guild,
it's harder for officers to find good recruits. Either you're taking
someone who left a reasonably close to time guild, in which case you may
be getting someone with issues, or the officers have to get the whole
guild out to backflag the recruit, which tends to be difficult when
you've spent the last 4-5 months doing those flag events already. At one
point our requirments were elemental flags and earth b key just because
the officers didn't want to spend anymore time backflagging.
