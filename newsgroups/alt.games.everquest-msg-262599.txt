Effectively yes. If their was a non-zero risk that Saddam would 
retaliate by releasing chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons on US 
population centeres there would have been no invasion.

Hell... I bet if there was a real threat that Saddam would be able to 
field even conventional weapons against US population centres there 
would have been no invasion.

Just goes to show you how much of a non-threat Iraq really was.

Do you really think North Korea is threatening your TROOPS with nuclear 
weapons?

How may civilians do you know wearing ventilators and chemical suits? 
Ok, now excluding all 2 of them, the rest of the population won't find a 
chemical/bio weapon attack to be that much more preferable. WMDs are 
WMDs.
