No, "one day" is an "astronomical measurement".

Hours, minutes, and seconds are entirely arbitrary divisions, based
on no astronomical event whatsoever.

If he chose to, ancient man could have decided to divide a 
day into 27 zeephans, each consisting of 146 quatloos, each of 
which was broken up into 97 blatzorfs, and it would be just
as "valid" as the current system of 24 hours/60 minutes/60 seconds.
