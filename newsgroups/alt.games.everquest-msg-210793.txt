There are simple reasons why halfling druids used to be popular.

#1 is if you want to run a halfling, back then the choices were limited. I
mean you don't see them diluted out because someone wanted to be a halfling
necromancer or SK. They were OK clerics, but a cleric is a druid that can't
solo. Ditto for halfling warriors, can't solo either.

#2 You wanted to be able to see. I mean being a human anything *REALLY*
*SUCKED* back then. Even with GLS it was pitch black for a lot of us. This
also pushed a lot of people into halfelven, wood elf.

#3 Hands down, Misty was the best newbie area in the game back then. They
had goblin workers dropping backpacks and all kinds of loot. You could
almost fight for you first 4 levels while standing next to a vendor to sell
your crap.

#4 Let's just say you wanted to eventually be able to move fast. Your
choices are Shaman and Druid. I did/do run an ogre Shaman and it sucked. So
what if you get SoW at level 9<?>, the only thing you need it for is to get
out of your hell hole of a starting zone. Same goes for Barbarians and
Trolls.

When you add up all the mistakes you don't want to make and deduct them from
the choices you can make, it ended up halfling druid.
