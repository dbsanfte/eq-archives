I did.  I like to use the name generator to get a general feel for what 
sort of names are good for that class, then mix it up and make my own.  
However, after a LONG time of trying every bloody vowel combination in 
the book, I gave up and started just taking name generator names.  Which 
also were not accepted.

He's a mule, thus he will never be interacting with others in the game, 
thus I do not have to be ashamed of his name :p
