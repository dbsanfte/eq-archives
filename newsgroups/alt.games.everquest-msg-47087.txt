If you have it on DVD, then please rip it (that preview) or if on VHS then
capture it (320x240 resolution please) and we'd be grateful for a good
quality (both audio and video) post somewhere (alt.binaries.movies or one of
them I'd guess, unless you knew of a better place that's more accessible for
those without news servers, or both, I hope you find a good, easy one for
you).

We'd be thankful for a copy of it. :)
