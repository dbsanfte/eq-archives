I don't see why people target the newbie guards anyway....why 
should death be good? want to say that next time you need a rez?

I think any start city and newbie area guard should be 
unkillable. You want to kill guards, go to HH and knock yourself 
out, go to commonlands and have a ball...

But then I also think that ALL quest turnin NPCs should be 
unkillable as well. I recently got my epic, and am currently 
helping out a few friends on tehirs and I don't know how many 
times we find the turn in NPC just got killed. Hell, I even had 
someone kill Naxot as I was getting ready to do a turn in. I had 
atone memmed and he could have rooted while I atoned him and then 
that asshat could have zoned out, and he could have killed him 
the next time. Not as if he actually drops anything anyway=(
