A druid guildie of mine is now 56. 1 month ago he had just made 50, tomorrow
he'll be 57 (2 blue left).

He joins a raid at least once a week, ports guildies around when they need
it bad (rezzes or for lowbie raids) and has so much pp on his name that he
simply dwarfs any other member in our guild (not that we're rich or
anything, but still).
His char is about 1/3 the age of my main and wasn't twinked in any way.

Druids are solo masters, all the way.


Now if I could only find some time to get my lvl 13 druid up to speed ;)
