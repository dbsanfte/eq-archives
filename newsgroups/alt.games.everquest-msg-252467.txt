It makes no difference though.  When you enter into an agreement to trade
$'s for anything, it is fraud to not pay up after the other party has
fulfilled his part of the bargain.  The important legal point is not in the
reality of plats or even if you own or do not own plats, but in the fact
that you made an agreement.
