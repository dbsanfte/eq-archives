I took my 51 chanter out for a mission and found that yes, resists are
much worse than I was used to, at least in Mistmoore theme. I easily had
a 50% of mez or stun being resisted the first try. With the pickup group
I was in that was extremely hard on my enchanter as no one in the group
made any effort to assist, like maybe the pally or cleric tossing in a
stun. For now I've put the chanter back on the shelf for a while,
hopefully after ldon has been out a few months more people will have a
clue how to play in dungeons.
