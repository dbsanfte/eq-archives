Since I've sometimes had problems like this in LDoN dungeons when trying to
target corpses, I've learned a couple little tricks that might be useful in
other circumstances:

-- a pet (at least a beastlord pet and I assume other classes' as well)
retains the corpse of the mob just killed as a target, until being sent onto
another mob. This appears to be true as long as the corpse exists and
without regard to distance (I've moved to another room with my group and
found that my warder still has the last unlooted corpse targeted). So I can
hit F1 twice to target my warder, do /assist which switches my target to the
corpse, and do /loot which loots it. Hence targeting and looting the corpse
without ever having mouseclicked.

-- sometimes when I am unable to get a corpse targeted by clicking on it, I
can target it by clicking on the corpse's name.
