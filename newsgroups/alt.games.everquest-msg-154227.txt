Nah , they are raising the general bar. Since 65th level characters with
more powerfull abilities will appear soon it is desireable to make all
encounters harder so that the flaw with restricting item enter rate by spawn
time is not exacerbated.

I am absolutely sure that they will both retune 2-3 encounters that where
for unexpected reasons far harder than intended, and that there will be no
retune for the 1000`s of other encounters that will be made far more
difficult.

I am not very happy with them right now .
