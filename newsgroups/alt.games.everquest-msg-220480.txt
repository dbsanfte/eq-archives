That's one of the reasons I'm currently PL'ing my BL in AC - a 90 ZEM: 
plentiful uncontested mobs; lots of casters (61 air and a BL warder make
it almost impossible for them to cast and they have low HP,) and runes
(vendor fodder) and blocks (usually sell them in about 1-2 hours of bazaar
time.)  I'm making about 700pp an hour and 1 yellow an hour for the 51
(almost 52) BL.  The stuff at the entrance is 44th and there's a shot at
getting a grimling mask.

It helps that I can summon 10slot weightless bags, and my BL has 6 general
slots open for them.  I walked away with 7 bags full of blocks and 2.5 10
slots full of stacks of acrylia runes saturday.
