Sounds to me like you did far more than just voice your opinion. There's 
a big differene between that and being a malcontent, which does more 
harm than good. I'd guess your (likely only temporary - what, a couple

Judging from what I'm hearing, all I can say is good riddance. Let me 
ask you this though, are you like this with every game that somehow 
fails to cater to *your* way of thinking and playstyle?

I hope you find WoW more to your liking. /shrug
