    That's nice in theory. In practice, players hate multiple branch
encounters where the branches actually mean something. Example: the
Cragbeast Matriarch in Txevu. She has six rooted adds around her chamber, on
a reasonably short respawn. Every time one respawns, it is random which of
the dozen or so possible pops it is. Each one gives a different ability to
the Matriarch - an AE, Rampage, Flurry, hits harder, reflects most spells,
haste, etc. So every time you go into the encounter, you could have a
radically different mob to fight.

    Except that we waste the adds FIRST, then kill them as they repop
immediately.

    We don't want to figure out which special abilities we could live with,
and which will destroy us. We don't want to make special arrangements that
every player needs to memorize for when various combinations of adds pop. We
don't want to watch the half hour to one hour of clearing of useless trash
mobs we did to get to this mob get wasted by the worst possible combination
of adds. We kill the adds, we get an encounter we can farm, we farm it. We
did our learning when we first encountered this mob, time for the reward.

    You'd see it more if you were a top-end raider, I think, but the basic
jist is this: nobody wants an hour or more of their lives wasted (and EQ's
basic gameplay in a raid environment is not sufficiently fun to warrant
raiding for the sake of raiding) because one person of 50-odd people didn't
know what to do. We've seen raids like that, we've done raids like that, we
rarely go back and do them any more often than necessary to flag off them
(and if they're pure loot raids, they sit idle). There's events that are
complex enough without random elements that training people to react to
contingent events is a waste of time.

    You got it.

    With the framework that exists in Everquest, it's exactly how mobs have
to behave. All random elements have to be such that the same basic strategy
for that encounter beats all possible combinations.

    You've inserted the "often", which you should not have. But the ideal
"challenging game" should surprise you, yes.

    Where were the healers set up? If the mob has a non-trivial AE, you've
wiped the raid depending on which side they were on. If there's a pattern to
the movement, then it's not random and the strat can incorporate elements
designed to counter the movement. If the direction of movement doesn't
matter, or can be countered with ease, then it's a useless detail and the
strat has it covered. If the direction of movement actually matters, and 50
people all have to do something every time he moves, odds are someone will
either lag or be clueless and you'll wipe. If that one person's reaction
didn't matter to the encounter as a whole, the encounter was too easy
anyways - EVERYONE should count.

    See the problems? You can give the mob a meaningless ability (one that
can be countered with the same strat every time, or which doesn't affect the
outcome in any way), or a meaningful one. Give him a meaningful one, and you
have to have everyone react to it (or else the encounter is boring for those
that need not react). If even one person messes up, for any reason, and it
wipes the raid, then players will hate the event and avoid it.

    Again, does the OT/mez team need to vary their tactics in any way from
"intercept with damageless aggro, attempt to mez, if unmezzable then
OT/kill"? If so, how long do people have to react to the difference before
it dooms the raid? As the opening system fiasco proved, EQ players hate
"twitch" gaming so if the reaction time is short people will hate your
encounter.

> have the mob vary
> his tactics based on raid composition

    This isn't a random element. This can be controlled by the raid, and
would lead to some very negative reactions depending on what the "optimal"
raid configuration was and how it matched a guild's roster. There was a mob
that could only be killed by one random class in GoD. If another class got
the killshot, it regenerated to max HPs and gave an emote indicating which
class was required. We all hate it, and avoid the place like the plague.

> have the mob vary his tactics
> based on how fast his health is dropping...

    Again, not a random element. There's at least two raids I can think of
where you must keep the health totals of multiple bosses within a certain
tolerance of each other, or bad things happen. Again, people hate those
raids.

    How did he figure out not to stop on the ramp, as opposed to not
stepping on the ramp at all? He needed to know enough about the map prior to
the ramp to know that going across was required. He also needed to notice
how he died. The player that just got zapped without seeing how won't know
if it was opening the door to the ramp and not moving away fast enough, or
brushing the wall beside the ramp, or clicking on a section of wall near the
far end of the ramp, or any one of a dozen other things will only get
through based on blind luck.
