Agreed.

More do than you think but there's no need for panic or spreading
messages of doom and gloom. Sure, be safe, and be smart. But please,
let's not get paranoid and live in little holes in the ground with
gasmasks at the ready.

>WE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED HERE IN AMERICA MORE THAN THE EVENTS OF THE 11TH.

I don't agree. Personally, I think they blew their wad. Now they'll be
on the run. Do you realize what kind of planning and coordination this
attack required? Expenses? Training? Patience? 

No,  I'm not saying let the guard down--quite the contrary. It's good
to be aware and prepared and that's just what's going on here in the
US. It's a new era, for sure, but it's no time to panic and spread
fear and messages of doom and gloom... Well, but then look at your
username. ;)
