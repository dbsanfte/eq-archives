This statement here has made the most sense about the "New" player.
Jeez.. remember your first time in Kelethen? how bout Akanon? jeez
Kaladim... and how bout that human hell hole Freeport...
No new player is just going to run around leveling to level 10 in just
10 hours... jeez.. try to remember how it was when you didn't know
what weapon to use, what spells to cast... hell even what items to
loot for the best profit margin..
