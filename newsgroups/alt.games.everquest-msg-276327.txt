It's funny, this does sound reminiscent of EQ, especially the early
years (say, the first 3).  I don't mean servers being down, I mean the
bitching about it. :)  

As was true with the whinefest that used to be the EQ boards, there is
a grain of legitimacy to the complaints.  People blow it out of
proportion because, hey, this is the internet, but there are issues
that need to be addressed.  I believe Blizzard is doing everything
they can to fix it; if they can't fix it right, they'll lose business
(and only 1/10th the people who say they are quitting will actually do
so, if it holds true to the EQ model).

Of course, this won't stop the whiners and apologists from spending
more time flaming each other than playing the game, but again, such is
the internet.  How did society get along without it?
