For the most part, they are twinks. (i.e. low level alts of high level
players) who started out with a thousand plat in the bank and do not
need to spend the time and inventory space running items back and forth
that sell for "small change". (Small to them, anyway.) Their trash is
your treasure, so loot up! One of the good things about twinks (and I've
had a few) is that you can hunt in the same areas as them and clean up
on about four times as much loot as you would on your own, thus amassing
your own fortunes faster. Enjoy!
