So quad kiting, root rotting, fear kiting, charm swarming... all tactical
behaviors that players discovered some time after the game was released...
all exploits, just because the 20 game designers with a year to think didn't
consider combinations of spells that 100 000 players with two years to
think managed to come up with?  To me, they aren't exploits, they
are at best "exploits" (ie "things Verant calls an exploit although there's
nothing about them that seems to violate the rules")

Sounds like an exploit of the zone line, and duping items is never
going to be acceptable no matter how you manage it.  The fact
that you need a spell to do it for some reason doesn't mean that
it isn't an exploit.  But using the knockback on a stun spell to move
someone... no, that in itself isn't an exploit, that knockback is
supposed to happen, if you can think of a clever use for it (say
getting someone rooted near the zone line over the line so he
can escape a pounding) no problem.

Doens't sound like an exploit if the spell is doing what its supposed to.
If you used Valor to get thru a door, that would be an exploit, Valor
isn't supposed to move you.  If you use Holy Might to get thru a door
thats probably an exploit too, Holy Might isn't supposed to force you
thru a solid object.  But using GFlux to gain altitude?  Its meant to throw
its target into the air.

Yes.  Or no, I'm saying that using the design in ways the programmers
didn't think of is ok, using coding flaws (where the game doesn't
react as logic would suggest) is not.

Its possible, but would certainly be clumsy of them to design in a hole,
coincedentally make it so that its possible to swim thru the hole, then
complain when people do swim thru the hole.  Particularly when you
use this "exploit" to get to the Hole.  Frankly, I can't see NOT going
in that way even if I have a key, cause I can't resist the pun.  OF course
it does hurt the economy, if the door couldn't be bypassed this way
think of how much money all the ultra low level evil erudite newbies
would make serving as doormen!
