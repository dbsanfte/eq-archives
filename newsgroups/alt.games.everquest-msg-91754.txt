Those people can suck and egg and just eat the loss of xp, then.
Anyone who refuses to donate upon request for that reason doesn't
deserve the rez...

You never *HAVE TO* disrupt the enjoyment of your game to travel to
rez someone. But, if you choose to do so, then make sure you agree on
a price if you expect one before doing so. Normal price I see asked on
a 49+ rez is 100p. If you go out of your way to get to them to rez,
then you can push that up. If the person offers round-trip ports, it'd
be polite to cut them a deal.. 'cause, yanno, if you don't, they just
might decide to charge for the port back. ;-p

For some. My druid ports without asking for money all the time. Only
money I take is what's offered freely without prompting from me... I
don't use porting as a source of income, I hunt for most of my cash.
