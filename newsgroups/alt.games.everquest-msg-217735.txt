Greetings:

I need to visit Phinigel Autropos (in Kedge Keep) to obtain a component of my L49 Paladin
Divine Might spell.

I'm aware that this spell can be traded.  I'm interested in the quest.

Specifically, I'm looking for "a dusty old finger bone", which can be found in a bag,
sitting on a rock, just through the star-shaped hole in the bottom of Phinny's room.

I've determined that the best way to obtain this component is:
1> Invite a 55+ Magician and a group-transporting Druid or Wizard to join the fun
2> Group up in PoK
3> Ride the Kaladim stone to BB
4> Run south to Dagnor's Cauldron
5> Swim to Kedge Keep
6> Magician casts Veil of Elements
7> Magician sneaks past Phinny, into that little room
7> Magician casts CoH (Call of the Hero) upon the questor, then upon the Druid or Wizard
8> Questor grabs the component
9> The Druid or Wizard evacs, succors, ports or TLs everyone

All in all, the complete mission should take no more than 20 or 30 minutes.

A couple of the dangers here are:
1> The Wizzy somehow loses invis while sneaking by Phinny, because he's attacked by a MOB
that sees through invis. CR time. This is unlikely.  Veil of Elements is golden.
2> The appearance of the Questor aggros Phinny and his guards. Unless the questor can hold
aggro while the Wizzy casts, double CR time. This is a little more likely, but needs to be
tested.

Of course, I could just storm Phinny's room to raid the component, which would require
clearing a path through Phinny. That would take a number of 55+ PCs to ensure survival of
the raid party; all would have to equip EB items or breathing buffs.

Suggestions?  Opinions?

Best Regards,

Tim ==
