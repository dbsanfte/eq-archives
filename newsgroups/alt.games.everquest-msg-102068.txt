Lol.

By the way, if you can Root, you can do the "parking" solo,
I've discovered.

Train Slansin *way* upstairs to the top of the mage guild
(I think it's the mage guild -- the one with the stairway
near Toresian).  Root him there, run downstairs to Toresian
and camp.  Re-enter immediately.

If the Root held for a reasonable length of time, and
it didn't take you too long to re-enter the game, Slansin
will be sauntering slowly down the stairs and about to
wander past Toresian about 15 seconds after you get back
in.  Just "Hail" him when he passes Toresian and you're
good to go.
