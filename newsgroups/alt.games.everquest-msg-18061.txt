Agreed, good paladins use mana.  I don't think Mason was implying
otherwise.  But I think mana regen (Clarity, bard song) is MUCH more
important to a paladin (in a group) than a larger mana pool.  That larger
mana pool doesn't help much unless you're constantly meditating back to
near full.  Most casters get the luxury of meditating during battles,
hybrids only med between pulls, which hopefully doesn't take too long in a
good group.

Now when soloing, yes, that bigger mana pool is important, because you will
be meditating back between fights, and you'll need it each fight.
