Depends on the class, really. With the possible exception of a well-
oiled, DPS-rich group chain-pulling in a PoP zone, certain classes will 
xp faster solo than in a group.

Well... On the one hand, I like grouping because I will have the chance 
to explore places where you'd never catch me solo (dungeons, generally). 
On the other hand, I like soloing because I'm not beholden to what other 
people expect of me. I can feel free to get bored and head off somewhere 
else, or, indeed, log off without owing anybody an apology or an 
explanation.
