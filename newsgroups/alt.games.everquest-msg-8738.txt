For the occasions when you *don't* want to cast one after the other, you still
have those eight pretty spell icons up and down your screen to cast them in the
order you choose.  You seemed to be implying that it was a very common thing to
cast those two in succession, thereby the usefullness of a hotkey to do so in
one convenient motion.  However, your method eliminates any usefulness of the
hotkey by then forcing the caster to press it twice, in which case, he/she may
as well have just hit the spell icons.  Additionally, social buttons don't "grey
out" like direct action buttons, so you don't know exactly when the first one is
finished.
    On to the "going about your business" part of it......... if you aren't
sitting there worrying about social keys or casting again, (as in the use of the
pause) a chanter who is using the overhead view for crowd control can once again
be concentrating on directing traffic as they should in tense multi-mob
situations.
  Just MHO, of course, but it certainly seems to make more sense.

Don't know how it goes in your groups, might be different, but we have standing
procedures in mine.  As the tank, everyone else uses a /assist key and they
target me.  Once I start attacking something, they stay on it until it's dead. I
make it a point to mention to people grouping with us for the first time that I
may often switch targets for a moment while I attack/taunt on something that
latches on to one of my casters, but rest assured that I will be back to the
primary mob shortly so stay on it.  Doing this, I've successfully kept up to
three mobs locked on me for 95% of the fight, eliminating fast hard damage to
the casters which would only suck up more healing mana which needs to be
reserved for me. A mob attmpting to hit me seven times is going to have a far
harder time of it than seven attempts at some finger waggler in robes who may
well be damn near dead after seven shots.  Your mileage may vary, but I see it
as the tanks job to take as much damage as possible while minimizing attacks on
casters.  If there are other tanks, melee types, in the group with decent armor,
I'll let them get whacked for a while, but I always switch off when somethinig
aggros on the cleric, enchanter, wiz, mage, etc.

Tough call. Probably a big heal spell, but now you've simply complicated the
problem by switching the damage from the enchanter to the cleric.

Exactly my point. ;-)

I'm rarely off the primary for more than a couple attack cycles just to taunt
them off. The difference is insignificant and the rest of the party is still
banging away on the primary target anyway.  If we are that worried about all the
adds, all the more important to make sure that all the healing mana is saved for
me and all the chanter mana is put to full effect mezzing and casting breeze,
not waiting around, doing nothing for the fight, while taking a bubbles worth of
damage a pop while they wait for me to get the last two bubs of health off the
primary target and put it down and come save their low A/C butts.  Heh.
/em ducks to avoid all the enchanter nukes suddenly launched at him.

And while we're on the subject of Enchanters, can I add in one more request from
the tanks, please?  DON'T CAST YOUR PET IN THE DUNGEONS!!!
Thank you. This has been a public service announcement from Tanks-r-Us.
