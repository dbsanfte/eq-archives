I have on more than one occaision consented an unlikely name, then logged off
and created a level one halfling rogue with that name.  At level one a halfling
has both hide and sneak at 50 skill, and rogues have a special ability: if they
hide successfully and then sneak successfully, then they can move, albiet
slowly, with almost total immunity to mob aggro.  I believe there are a few
mobs with See Invisible on that will still spot them, but both undead and
"live" mobs without this ability will be blind to them.  There are few
locations indeed that such a character cannot drag in.

In addition, there are certain other combinations you can make that are perfect
draggers in one location or another; level 1 dwarven clerics of Brell, for
example, can use DA and can move thru much of the Hole without aggro.  Ogres
(is it?) of Rallos Zek are not KOS in much of Kael Drakkar.

Now it would be possible to log, make the character, log, get your original
character to consent, then log back to the alt and go drag... but using my
trick of just consenting some really odd name (Xftyli, Bnglus,
Heydontouchmether etc) you can avoid the irritation of having to log log log
like that.
