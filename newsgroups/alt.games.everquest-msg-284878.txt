It would be state law, if anything (for US customers, anyway). I am just 
curious as to SoE's motivation for suddenly deciding to charge this tax at 
this late stage of the game, especially when I can still make purchases 
from other well-established companies online without having to pay sales 
tax.

However, the state I live in does require companies that have a business 
presence here to charge sales tax on online purchases to any customers who 
live in this state. I have encountered this most recently with Dell, for 
example. 

I guess SoE has set up shop in my state now. Or have they...? Funny how SoE 
has such an "Evil Empire" vibe about them in my mind. I mean, I'd bet even 
the likes of Microsoft look at SoE and think, "Damn, but they sure do 
exercise some questionable business practices."
