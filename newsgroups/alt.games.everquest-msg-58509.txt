I like my high elf barbie doll mage very much. She looks the part. Stats are
good, very well rounded without any glaring weaknesses. She can see
reasonably well in the dark, is tall enough to shoot a bolt at something
(that's a problem with gnomes, the reduced horizon) and doesn't have the
faction problem of a dark elf. Human mages are just.. well.. wrong.

If you do go mage, whatever race, be agnostic for less faction problems
later in life. Max your int, then put the rest in strength. You'll
appreciate the extra carrying capacity.

The real problem with high elves and wood elves is the Gfay newbie zone. I
didn't like it and would suggest anyone starting there leave as soon as
possible.

Extra Information:
Good at solo as well as groups, but not the best at either.
High offence, things die fast.
No defense, mages die fast.
Don't overnuke, see above.
No crowd control abilities.
No real point in developing any skills except tailoring unless you do the
Coldain prayer shawls quests.
Not much equipment to choose from and equipment will, for the most part, not
improve the character's performance.
Awesome epic. Awesomely difficult to complete.
Many strategies to figure out how to be most effective in different
situations.
Self sustaining, never out of food, water, weapons, lightsources or
bandages.
Broken in the high end raid game. Argue if you want, that's my opinion.
Pet pathing in dungeons is fuxx0rd. No arguments there.
