Have you tried any of that EXPENSIVE booze sold on the moon?  I found some
in Seru that was 62 pp PER DRINK, and it wasn't the most expensive one, but
it was the most I was willing to spend on uberbooze (yes, I actually bought
one shot of it) that one was Dawnshroud Cider, but I know there's more, the
vendor name according to my log parser was Yurik Pyorale.
