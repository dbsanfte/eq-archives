Well...judging from C3PO, the purpose of droids is to provide comic relief,
and an imcompetent army has more comic potential. :-)

Here's how far Star Wars has fallen.  When I went to see TPM, we were at a
theater we had not been to before, and the labeling was slightly confusing.
We ended up going into the wrong movie, which we did not discover until the
previews were done.  Rather than switch, we decided to just watch that
movie, and catch TPM the next day, so we would not risk having missed the
start of TPM.  So, we saw "Wild Wild West".  Not only was it far better just
as a movie in general, it was better as a *science* *fiction* movie.
