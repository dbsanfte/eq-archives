This is coming from a non-enchanter's point of view, but a guildy of
mine seems to do really well with DC. She can solo with it without
fear of the charm breaking at the wrong time, and the added DPS is
excellent in groups, particularly in places where it would be
otherwise inadvisable to allow the chanter to charm. And it means we
can buff it up to incredible levels without having to worry about
scraping the chanter off the wall. I don't know how much it is hyped,
so it may indeed be overrated, assuming people are saying it will
allow you to magically shovel plat and experience into a bag, and then
give you a blow job afterwards, but anything less than that I'd say
it's more than worth the amount of work you put into getting it.
