Oh yeah, thats exactly what im saying.. lol
My point was bards and SK's have more utilities to split than monks do.

Those tools arent enough to automatically make them a better puller though,
I've been pulling for years.. I know the pathing, the little tricks and such
to get an edge.. a bard with all that and his better "toolbox" could pull
some/a lot (undefined amt) better than an equiv monk, yes.. or more so, i as
a bard could pull a lot of the same mobs easier than if i were on my monk

Well no you see, if you'd read and understood my point.. I don't develop
pulling techniques based on something I only have in limited charges.  Be it
snare, invis, whatever.. it won't form a part of my strat.

Using charged items at any other time is totally irrelevant, from my resist
potions to my levi, gate and GVD invis, charges just doesn't come into it.
The only time it matters is occasions where im pulling, because i sure as
hell don't have enough bag slots to carry batteries or snare glands for a
sessions pulling in a place fairly long and involved (2-3 of time.. maybe
fennin)

Right, because your exact words were not, and i quote
[we always have been and always will be the best at "splitting", it's more a
matter of time spent]

What do we have that splits at the same rate as mez and fade? Thats right,
nothing.
