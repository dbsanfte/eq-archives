Actually, there is no spell for BL pets.  Its an innate ability to summon a
creature you get at level 9.  I can't remember if you have to train it or it
just shows up in your abilities options.  Take a look.  If its not there,
head off to your local trainer.

(PS As its not a spell, it also doesn't use mana to summon one which is
nice)

Have fun :)
