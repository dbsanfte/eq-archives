Lok,
You've been kill filed forever.  Perhaps one day you'll have bizbee penuche
but you're just not there yet.

You write for shit and you bore me to fucking death.

bizbee,
You are one of the best "angry and bitter" reads on Usenet.  Hats off to you
sir!
You'll always be one of my favorites, I'm not sure I can express the sheer
joy you bring me.
Thank you, for being you.
Best regards,
The Infamous *il128*
