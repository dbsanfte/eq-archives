The law isn't as cut and dry as this conversation might make it seem. On
questions of responsibility for an accident, we're talking about the law of
negligence (willfully hitting someone is a very different matter) and when
it comes to determining if someone has acted with negligence, the test is
one of "reasonableness". That is, what would an imaginary "reasonable man"
have done in the same circumstances. So, it's not always possible to predict
where the liability will be based on a partial description of the facts;
it's really up to the trier of fact to get the whole story and then apply
this test of reasonableness. Example: in your hypothetical, if the guy
running the red light did so with plenty of room to get in and, you saw him
and sped up because you were pissed off, I'd say that your behavior wasn't
reasonable and his was, and I'd find you liable for the accident.

Basically, all our laws on negligence come down to this question of what's
reasonable under the circumstances. The Vehicle Code (a different set of
laws) determines criminal liability (traffic tickets and other vehicular
offenses resulting in fines and/or jail), but the Vehicle Code doesn't
necessarily determine who's "at fault" in an accident. The Code does provide
guidance on the point and even sets up some presumptions that can be used in
liability cases, but ultimately the issue of who's responsible comes down to
this reasonabless test and any of the presumptions can be overcome with the
right evidence.

That's what trial lawyers are for. ;-)
