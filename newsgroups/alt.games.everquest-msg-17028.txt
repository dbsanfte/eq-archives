Most packages of EverQuest allow one month of free game play.  Usually, the
best bet is to just dive right in, assuming you are offered this free month.
Though, even if you aren't its $10.00 for a month.  It costs more than that
to go to the movies twice within a month whereas I have a wife that usually
wants to go four times a month. <grin>  So, its cheap entertainment in my
book.
