The problem with the KoT quests is that they all kill your FP Millitia
Faction.

If you kill Sir Lucan, you get a huge positive bonus with them.  I had my
level 8 Iksar Monk hit Lucan once while someone was killing him, and I was
amiable.

Altunic Jartin in EC is on KoT faction, but he is a merchant, and will never
drop below Dubious con so you'd have to get to Apprehensive to notic if
you're KoS or not.

It pops you close to the Paladin guild and on wrong turn will drop you near
the Cleric guild, both of which can cause problems if KoS.

Priests of Marr are the Clerics in NFP and if one aggroes you, the Knight of
Truth will come to finish you off.  Also the Bard Guild may be a problem if
you are KoS.   The only other NPC I can think of is Zigg Flin who is on
Gnome faction.  He's in the blue house near the WFP zone.

bank.
