AAHAH except they limited that to only 2 level delevel now because of
people abusing it on the PVP servers. Or was that only on the pvp
servers? I forget. 

Errr wait no I'm thinking of that incorrectly.. they made it so you
only have the STATS of two levels above or something.

Yeah I had finally got a dark elf cleric to level 7 on FV, felt pretty
good making my own patchwork, had some of the level 5 spells (5 plat
is a LOT to come up with as a rank newb with no one paying outragous
prices for trade ingredients yet) then got on and was level 24.. with
no money, not even all the level 5 spells yet, ahaha.
