Actually they'd have to change quite a bit more than you seem to
realize. There is only one scale of mob levels. The "hard" scale is
simply the "normal" scale with the party average level +5. So there's
not actually any mobs in the hard scale you wouldn't see in the normal
scale with the exception of the very top.

If you added a medium, you would have to add an entirely new set of
mobs. It would in essense mean as much work on creating mobs as the
expansion originally took.

That still might not be a huge amount of work, of course. But its
significant. I wouldn't be opposed to a medium set myself.
