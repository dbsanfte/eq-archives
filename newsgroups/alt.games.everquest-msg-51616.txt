Do they do +7 str/dex rings? Velium/FE rings are +6.
As an ogre your strength should be fine and providing your dex is over 75
don't worry about it. I'd suggest either Jagged bands (+5AC +3str) or if you
have the plat +6ac +65 hp rings. You'll find many other items that give good
AC will also give strength bonuses and you'll be nearing 200 without even
trying.
Yes, they better suited to rogues (or weak raced warriors) The advantage of
playing a strong race is not worrying about your strength stat and being
able to concentrate on AC and Health.

Orcfang +3str +15hp +3ac (about 50pp ea)
Cougar Claw +4ac +3str +2dex (about 150pp ea)
