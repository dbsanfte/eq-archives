Using the argument of the first poster, why should a cleric get gems?
he can make lot's of money ressing, heard of clerics being offerd 1kpp
for a rez, probably not the norm but i hear on OT a lot of rez
requests usually around 50pp - 200pp

I play a druid only lvl 19 so i can only port myself, but if i am in a
group and contribute to it i expect to get to share the loot.
