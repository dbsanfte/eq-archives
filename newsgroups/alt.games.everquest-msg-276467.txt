Depends on what he means by lower levels...

Cap is 5 points per level as I recall, druid hard cap is lower than 
ranger hard cap, and at level 20 rangers get the ability to sort.  If by 
low level he means sub 20, and low enough that the druid hard cap is not 
hit, then either one will work equally well.  Given that, whichever one 
is higher level is best, until the ranger is high enough level to beat 
the druid cap and/or sort.

Yes.  For all tracking classes this is true.

<Normal> is what the druid will always see, same for a bard.  Bard cap is 
even lower than druid though, and I think bards don't get track until a 
certain level, not certain to be honest.

As I vaguely recall from the couple of encounters I had (both of which I 
survived I might add), the northwest corner of the big open area of the 
zone (outside the hidden valley with the druid and wizard portals) is the 
best spot.  I would park a bit south of the corner, as Gore tends to path 
along the north wall I think.  Invis will be very handy.
