I recently did a clean install of windows XP Pro and it already had drivers
for my SBLive! Value and sound was working before the install was complete.
I have since upgraded to the creative XP drivers and everything has gone
smooth. However, I lack all the creative software as there is no way to
install it without the lame ME drivers(at least thats the way it is on the
CD Dell gave me) so I have had to deal with the 2mb sound font sond bank. I
got so tired of the bad quality I just turned the music off. Other than that
XP is a dream best windows I have ever seen. 3 days now and I cant get the
OS to crash.

Anyways does anyone know where I can download XP versions of liveware and
the 8mb sound bank?
