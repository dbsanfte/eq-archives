There are new level 65 ancient spells in GoD.  I don't think anyone has
reached the zone where they drop yet though.  The 60s ancients drop from VT
nameds, Lord Seru, and Vulak in ToV, and are all no drop on servers not
Firona Vie.  The only one I know of that is looked for by level 65s is
Ancient Concussion, but even that is replaced by elemental pants.
