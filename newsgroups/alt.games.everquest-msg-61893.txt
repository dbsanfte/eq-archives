1.  I would assume they are...my gnome necro started out KOS...but killing
gobs and crushbone orcs and doing quests afterwards got me to apprehensive.
No one in Kaladim attacks me now.

2.  Your best bet is to get a bind in GFay at the BB zone line.   You cannot
get a bind in BB ...nor Kaladim if you are KOS.  When you get Bind Affinity,
you will be able to bind yourself *almost* anywhere.
