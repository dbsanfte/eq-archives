It's a bit slow in places on my system (2ghz Athlon XP, GeForce5900,
512 mb 333mhz) and I have a feeling it's down to the RAM - all the

upgrrading in the next few days, so I'll post and update.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
