It's not flawed logic at all.  I personally like soloing in a MMORPG.

People who like to play MMORPGs solo do so for a number of reasons, among
which are the following:

Choice. In a single-player game, you have no real choice of what to do or
where to go. You follow the scripted, impersonal storyline where it takes
you and go from there. Games like Jedi Academy provide a bigger selection of
pathways because you can choose which order you take the 6 missions in a
set, but beyond that, its linear. Once youre in a scenario, you're stuck in
it, doing it the way the developers wanted.  Those games are dependant on
their story to see you through.  Games like Halo have a compelling story, so
you don't really mind being run down the chute.  Instead of advancing your
character, you're goal in a night's play is to advance the storyline.
Sadly, not all single-player games are so well written.

A mmorpg gives a lot of choice. Do I want to group or solo?  I can do
either. Say I want to solo ...do I want to mission or find an interesting
spot to try to camp?  I RPed my ranger as a lone wolf who only came in to
towns when fletching supplies ran low.

All of these choices are unavailable in a single-player game.

Likewise, there's interaction. Single-player games are somewhat lonely.  In
a mmorpg, I can solo and still be a part of a community. I can chat in the
zone or in /gu.

Or I can change my mind and join a group

Sometimes people solo because they want to thump bad guys on the nose, but
they are in too foul a mood to inflict themselves on other rational beings.
That's what I'd do a lot after work. After being thrown to the wolves at
work I want to hit the wolves back. ;-)

And these are just a few of the reasons people solo in a mmorpg. They
shouldn't be treated like social misfits or lepers for it.  It's just a
preference.
