    You can min-max much better in AD&D. A sane GM will take steps to halt
some of the most silly rules quirks you try to exploit, though. Like STR
damage bonus on thrown items like darts, where you can hurl three or more of
them per round. It's very heroic seeing the mighty warrior run around trying
to keep distance between himself and the monsters so he can continue to
throw darts at them for maximal damage output at low level.

    Maybe not the first part about being too powerful, but certainly the
last part about everyone playing the same character. I think they looked at
the whole archery thing in Ultima Online and realized that players will
min-max if they know how, and that destroys any sort of diversity or
selection balance you were hoping to achieve. I'm old enough to remember the
pre-Kunark debates about "what is the best weapon/weapon combo in EQ" - it
sort of destroys the idea of "diversity" once everyone knows what the few
best items are and start striving towards those items and only those items.

    There's also the simple fact that as long as we can't see what the rules
are, we can't whine about them. Listen to the colossal moaning from high-end
players about 127 being the stats cap on items, or the soft cap on AC, or
the cap on overall MANA pool, or the FT cap, etc. Min-maxers are never happy
knowing they can't max to their heart's content. We also don't get to see
where VI screws up without doing some analysis.
