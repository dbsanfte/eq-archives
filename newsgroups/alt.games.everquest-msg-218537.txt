No my premise is that the systems were certified for use federally and
at the state levels for more than 30 years with a known and acceptable
margin of error. The limitations of the system are known and
documented. No one "ignored" anything. 

An "acceptable margin of error" is not a "known problem". As long as
the systems function within that margin they are working as designed
and meeting certification standards.

Peoples perceptions changed after November 2000 and the "acceptable
margin of error" is no longer acceptable. This fact does not mean that
the systems are flawed or defective. It simply means that
certification standards have been raised and some punch card voting
systems no longer meet the new requirements.

Close Elections that are taken to court are not "proof" that punch
card voting systems are faulty. To be faulty the system would have to
violate or not meet the certification requirements (which include the
acceptable margin of error). 

None of the states in the examples you mention above decertifed the
systems or banned their use in future elections. Obviously the systems
when "called into question" were NOT found to be "faulty" or defective
enough to replace.

None of the instances you quoted resulted in a nation-wide demand to
replace the punch card systems. None of the instances you mention
resulted in a revision of certification standards. That is what makes
November 2000 an anomaly.

I never claimed punch card systems were perfect.

Close Elections that are taken to court are not "proof" that punch
card voting systems are faulty or defective The "fault" is not in the
punch card voting systems (they work as designed). It is in the
assumption that all (or almost all) elections will will have a margin
wider than the acceptable margin of error.

The only thing rendered "false" is your ability to use logic and
reason. You hang your whole argument on the rare instances where the
outcome of an election falls within the acceptable margin of error
and/or is taken to court. You are completly ignoring the facts
regarding the continued use of these systems nation-wide and in the
very same counties and jurisdictions that you cited examples from
above.

Again your premise is flawed. 

I never stated the systems were perfect, I stated that the systems
were certified and in use for more than 30 years (warts and all).
After November 2000 the "acceptable margin of error" was no longer
acceptable. it is as simple as that. Which brings this whole argument
back to my original post

Qutoe\
Those machines/ballots have been in use for more than 30 years. No one
had a problem with them until Nov 2000. The only thing that has
changed is peoples perceptions. There is nothing fundamentally wrong
with the punch card ballot systems.
