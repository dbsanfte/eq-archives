    Thank you. :) It was a quickie done up while at work (shhh!), so I
didn't elaborate as well as I might have if I'd had more time. We did a
'raid' on Oggok yesterday evening, all the way to the bank, but it wasn't
nearly as fun or challenging as Neriak. I'd gone to Oggok alone the previous
evening after Neriak, and was able to obtain over a gold bubble of xp in
about 2 hours from the guards, so that should suggest how un-challenging
ogre guards are (I was still a level 45 cleric at the time, leveled to 46 in
Oggok last night). To make it a bit more challenging, we tried taking on
both the exterminator (who seems to have roughly half a million hit points,
based on how much damage we did to him just to get him down to 98%), and the
PoD (who hits much harder than Allakhazam posts suggest). We finally decided
to give up on the exterminator when we saw how long it was going to take (it
was doable, certainly, but would have taken probably an hour at our dps),
and had to run for our lives from the PoD. :P  Only one actual death in
Oggok, and that was when Claviger accidently aggroed one of the guildmasters
(who sliced him down fairly quickly, since I didn't have time to cast a c
heal, only superior heals).

    Indeed, and even though it was in character for us to do something like
that to a dark elf, I still felt bad about it, so when a lowbie ogre (don't
really think this one was a newbie) asked me for a weapon and some plat on
Sunday night, and the same one for more plat last night, I went ahead and
gave it to him without trying to ruin his faction. :) As for the dark elf, I
really don't think we ruined his faction, maybe took him from 'amiable' to
'indifferent' with his guards. :) I'll have to send him a tell sometime
in-game and ask. Can I have that biscuit now that I've changed me evil ways?
:)

    I agree, it was good RP on their part, but next time we won't make it
quite so easy for them to train us. :P The person most responsible for
training was high enough level that she wouldn't want to die for the sake of
it, so next time, we'll just set up camp further from the zone. Oh, did I
say next time? No, no, there won't be a next time. Wouldn't dream of it.
*wink*

    I'll have to find the Firiona Vie messageboard, I've heard of it once or
twice before, but as far as I remember, have never visited it. Is much in
the way of RP events in-game posted on it? Should be fun to find and
read/post to. :)

    Could very well have been us, especially if the residents were truly in
an uproar, lol. One of the funnier events was earlier on when a resident
decided she'd 'help' us by bringing us guards (this may have been the
precedent for training us). The first guard she brought us was green to me,
didn't attack, and was easily killed by me with a single hit. The newbie
with us, level 11 (I'd thought he was lower level than this at first, which
is why his deaths didn't concern me at the time...once we found out he would
lose xp from dying, we told him not to hit the guards anymore), said that
guard conned blue to him. The next guard that particular player brought us
was dark blue to me, but was an ogre (still not sure why an ogre guard was
in Neriak, but might not have been a true guard, although his name was
'Guard someoneorother', since he was dubious to me), and this was right
after Claviger went LD, so he went unmolested by us (well, me, at that
point). :)

    I'm thinking seriously of perhaps trying to get up an actual raid event
to go into Neriak, although they're apparently not as rare (from what you
said above) as I'd thought. I did invite one of the 'nicer' dark elves (the
one who let me know where Claviger's body was, not the one who actually
dragged him to the entrance) to invade Kaladim. I think it adds a certain
depth to RP when starting cities are invaded like that, and is certainly
fun. Claviger's player told me that the 'invasion' of Neriak was the best
time he's had on EQ in the year and a half we've been playing. :)
