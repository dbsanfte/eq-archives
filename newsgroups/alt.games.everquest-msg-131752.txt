Shrink....

Yah, that's the most annoying thing to me about this spell.  I was in
Paludal fighting and there was someone in the group that kept casting Shrink
on me after I'd ask them not to (waste of mana and just annoying....read
on).  Nothing like being in a fight at one point with normal perspective and
then all of sudden the perspective changes when you are going to pull and
you wonder if you're crouched, or something else odd happened, then you pull
something, start fighting it and all you see is bandit crotch.  Yes, I know
this is what halflings experience all the time, but still, confusing.  Wish
an icon would pop up so I would know at first glance what the heck was going
on.

"Did you shrink me again?"
