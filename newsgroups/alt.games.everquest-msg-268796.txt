> Cauliflower is ok, but broccoli is far and away superior.

Take a small head of cauliflower - trim and core it.  Place it
in a bowl with some cling wrap over it.  Nuke it for 5 minutes.
Cover with a mixture of mustard, mayo and finely diced onions,
nuke for 2 more minutes.  Cover with grated cheese, nuke for 1
- 1.5 minutes.

Yumm.  

For extra presentation points, steam some broccoli while you do
the above, place broccoli on a plate in a circle with flowers 
pointing out, place cauliflower in the center.  Pretty, tasty and
not terribly unhealthy (depending on how much mayo you put in.)
