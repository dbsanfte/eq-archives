bounding box?

Were lucky if we have 1 necro at a raid every fortnight

I don't know if mages were using pets (we set out by trying to mez stuff and
assist the MA) but yes, they are quite handy for pointing out mobs...

Ever tried to ae any of the earlier waves btw?  Death mission?

Well we didn't even know if we'd get another chance (think ive read
something about him only being alive for a set period of time)

We know now at least... heh

We've never had 2 tries on him yet.. on our first real attempt, we were
fighting the Idol unslowed to simulate the fight better.. which meant when
he died, half our raid was pwnt and we needed to rebuff.

What infuriated the most, last week when we tried (or week before, now its
Monday).. we fought unslowed Idol again, took him down quite comfortable
down to 5% or less (tank transitions are still kindof new for us... AoW/Idol
is the only mobs we've needed it on)

Anyway we camped out at 5% (not because we couldn't kill him.. but we wanted
everybody ready for AoW when Idol died)

This time we re-pulled Idol and slowed him, near flawless kill.. for the
first time, we were going to get 2 shots at the AoW (each guild on prexus
ive seen first kill AoW, got him on their second try of the day)

Then inc.. some fucking tool 60 warrior was "trying to buy food" (in the
arena!!!) and trained the AoW on us..  rez, rebuff.. once again only 1 shot
on him.

This same person has trained Idol on us too while we were c.ring, some
people are such immature dumb fucks.

Guaranteed death for "someone"?  Unless you have 13 or so manaburn wizards,
except mass deaths while you kill that mofo.  Sonta is simply a fight of
"kill him, before he kills you all"

Yeah the earring is seriously nice (ear is a notouriously shitty slot to
upgrade with hitpoints)

10 WIS on a wizard earring?

Btw have you ventured much into the "hidden temple" (i think its called.. im
a cazic n00b)?

We went last night with a pretty powerful single group (several flowing
thought items on the cleric, shaman and enchanter, primal/41% haste on the
melees etc)  and it was really brutal.   The kind of place that unless you
had serious mana regen and damage output, a single group probably wouldn't
even make it there

Im just wondering what nice is hidden away in there, for it to be so damn
tough heh (2 groups won't have problems im sure).  It was a ton of fun, but
it was really challenging - lots of unmezzable and unstunnable adds, and
level 60 "exp" mobs
