I never fool myself.  I just want to *play*.  Alot of my friends are under 60. 
(I've put my experience in AAs for a while so I don't get too far ahead of them
- I just got Spell Casting Mastery - so obviously I'm not one of those people
who is set on *experience grinding*).
What's foolish to me is that the same people who are sitting around /LFG in POT
but decline a *crappy experience group* are *still* sitting in POT LFG when we
get done with an LDON and move on to the next or POD or whatever.
