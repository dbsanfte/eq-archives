Mmm. At the end of the day it IS still a game where the vast majority
of systems are going to have to be policed by game systems though; if
its to be massively multiplayer anyway, surely? It cant be 'personally
adjudicated' by game-staff for 1000's of people.

Given that, and lack of genuine ability to personally verify players
beyond credit card details I'm not sure how disposable toons can be
got rid of. The closest I can see is binding an account to a single
toon and banning the entire thing on infraction, causing a new account
to be bought. I dont see how thats much different than banning an
entire account in existing games though, unless you're envisaging
a system where reputation is all. There have been plenty of griefers
who revel in their rep though, and there always seem to be plenty
of fanboys who actually rally to the flag of griefdom.

Well, replace 'level' with power differential. If its a roleplaying
game, a core attribute of that to me is long term development of
character; if the system is arbitrated by automated rules thats
going to have to be quantifiable rather than qualatitive. I am all
for small scale human run role playing games, but they dont count
as MMORPG for me. If you have these sorts of systems to measure 
ability, and risk involved in combat, weakened conditions, etc,
however you measure or obtain them - skill trees, twitch reflex,
level, hit points, favour with gods, experience with game
systems, whatever - there is going to be a differential that can
be abused and exploited.

True. But then you get the jerk following you around doing the same
thing ;) Griefers love personalised griefing as much as zonewide
harassment. I actually *do* think PVP makes a game better. I am
yet to be convinced that it can work large scale without being
entirely unhindered and effectively becoming a Quake, even if
slower paced, or so constrained it loses the immersion of 
always being at 'risk'. I hope to be convinced otherwise though ;)

No; Thats not what I'm saying at all. I have seen many people
say things like 'it should be addressed by making defense easier
than assault' or 'punishment should be severe for griefing', but
I havent seen real elaboration of how to do that in a manner that
doesnt allow organised griefers to exploit it, require huge
manual administration (which limits game size and possible success
in terms of economics), or impose artificial constraints so much
that it hurts the sense of immersiveness and risk I'm looking for.

I'm not saying its not possible, or that I think its not worth
pursuing; Im pondering the issues involved and have yet to see
anyone genuinely outlining what seem like plausible approaches.

Of course, if you HAD concrete resolutions to these issues I'd
expect you to be out there developing the game I'd happily 
play instead of telling us about it so some established player
could cherry pick your bones, I guess ;)

I guess I was also saying you were being very rude (which, by
the way, was 'noted' ;) ) and unreasonably petualant, which
perhaps I should have either not bothered doing or done in
a private email to avoid intermingling with the more interesting
discussion about game design.

Thing is, I loved the rowing boat. Now they've plated it in steel
and put boilers in I'm bored, and quit. I'm looking for another
rowing boat, better yet - a skiff! a raft! or even, *drool*,
a floating barrel and a bedsheet for a sail ;)

I liked the open-endedness of original EQ, the peril, the choices
that had to be made, even with the griefing that came. The original
/consent, the lack of no drop and lore, the ludicrously dangerous
journeys to cross continents and agonising corpse runs. I hated
them too, of course, but I kept coming back because the fact I
could avoid the bits I hated by sufficient skill, kept the whole
thing entertaining and interesting, and provided the context and
space for the friendships, struggles and frustrations we bred.

Sure ;) But MMORPGs are populated by people. Where warfare is permitted
people war, and the weak are crushed. Where the weak are protected huge
constraints exist on warfare. Perhaps I misunderstood your position,
but I still dont see how we can reconcile the peril and thrill of a
state of war with the domination of determined warlords (or 'griefers').

A system of 'law' enforced rigidly enough to make murder a relatively
infrequent event also effectively seems to become a a system of
consensual PVP. At least, as far as I can see. Theres a genuine conflict
between the two objectives; that of immersive open ended player
defined interaction, and that of constrained, governed, play nice
rules.
