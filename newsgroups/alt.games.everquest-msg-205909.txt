As a lvl 30 enchanter I have put together scavanger hunts for simple items
I needed but didn't feel like hunting on my own. (ie bat wings, fish scales,
and such) Anyone bringing me a stack of 5 would get an appropriate buff.
After I ran this, I was almost overloaded in batwings..... Newbie zones
are GREAT places to run a scavanger hunt.
