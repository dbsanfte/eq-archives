Since Barbarian is a race, while wizard and cleric are classes,
its evident that you didn't do a particularly good job of playing EQ, so 
your judgement of whether it sucked or not isn't very revealing.

If you'd said "a barbarian, an elf, and an Iksar", or "A warrior, a 
wizard, and a cleric", then your credibility would be higher.

You also don't note if you played an hour a day three days a week, or 4 
hours a day 5 days a week.

You don't mention whether you actually managed to level up to say level 
20 or so with any character.

I tried EQ out, played one character to level 4, a second to 8 or so, 
decided it sucked and quit.  Later, discussion with a friend who'd 
played more brought me back to try it again.  This time things clicked 
for me, and I ended up playing the game for over 4 years; longest I've 
ever played -any- CRPG, or any other computer game for that matter.

There are things that suck about it, but overall, I'd say this makes it 
the best game I've ever played; it retained my interest and made me feel 
rewarded for literally thousands of hours of play time.

AND hundreds of thousands of other people have done the same thing, over 
the years, in aggregate I'll bet more player-hours have been spent on EQ 
than on any game in the history of the computer.

It may suck, but its done so for an extraordinarily long period of time, 
for an extraordinarily large number of people, who keep at it for an 
extraordinarily large number of hours... and oh, spending an 
extraordinarily large amount of money (buying each expansion as it comes 
out, plus spending the monthly fee every month for years?  I spent 
approximately $900 on the game, show me another computer game people 
spend that much on?
