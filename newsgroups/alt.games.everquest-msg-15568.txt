Weird, I was thinking about this just yesterday.  My 25 twink bard (well,
twinked now...he was my main up to level 16, then I fell in love with my
druid who ended up being my main for a long time, doing the Ro armor quests)
was low on brass skill (shocker, eh?) so I sang DDD for about 5 hours while
reading and watching TV to get him from skill 17 to 130.

ANYWAY, I got to thinking about a possible and probable exchange in a few
levels:

Idiot Group Leader:  Hey, just sit there singing the mana song, pimp.
Me:  Okayyyyy...say, what level is your bard?
IGL:  I don't have a bard
Me:  Well, when you get your bard a higher level than mine, feel free to let
me know how you think I should run mine.  Until then, you do your job, I'll
do mine.

(yeah, rambling today)
