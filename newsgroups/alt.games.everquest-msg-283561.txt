Logged onto a new server this afternoon for an hour or so, created a 
fresh out of the box Ogre SK.  Instead of tutorial, I sent him to his 
home city for an old fashioned start.

First, let me say that Ogguk is almost as bad a maze as Neriak, and the 
map doesn't help a whole lot.  Then there's Feerrot, which is dark, 
hilly, and full of trees.  Hard to find mobs to kill, and the mobs, once 
found, almost seem to flee when low on HP.  The map does at least help 
find vendors, and find Ogguk again.

I killed a metric ton of lizardman broodlings, and got exactly one 
pristine lizard scale.  Since every single piece of Ogre SK armor 
requires at least one (In two cases, two) of these, this looks like one 
of the Labors of Hercules to accumulate.  Perhaps other classes require 
other parts, and some sort of trade economy will develop, or you could 
group up with other classes and everybody get what they need as it drops.

I also killed about 12 of the armadillos in town, getting two of the 
husks... only to discover that I'd eaten one.  At any rate, I imagine 
that other ogres would hunt these guys pretty heavy, so it won't be 
nearly as good a quest when the town is full.

I'm thinking I've missed an important factor in trying to decide which 
race/class to play on Progression, which is their start area.

If Feerrot sucks, then where to go from there?  Innothule is no picnic, 
and then what after that?  UGuk?  Another maze!

Yeah, in theory Ogre might be the best race for a tank, but I'm not sure 
I'm willing to go thru the early life of an ogre, in order to get to the 
"cool" part!
