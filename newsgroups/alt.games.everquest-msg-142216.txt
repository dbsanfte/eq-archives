Whatever gave you that idea? The druids role is the same as any priests.
Help the people live in the world as close to the tenants of religion as
they can and to intercede on ther behalf with the divine :p A druids tenant
is to keep all things in BALANCE not to protect the shrubbery. If it helps
the 2 close examples would be the jedi knights in star wars, or the practice
of vodoun. There are some neo-druid types running around as well , but
without a good blood sacrifice or a nice spring orgy there really isnt much
point:)

Really good compared to what? Yeah if you compare to a non caster you get
some really nifty stuff , but compared overall to the casters you are
severely lacking. You are a priest for a reason and the only ones the wood
elves get.
