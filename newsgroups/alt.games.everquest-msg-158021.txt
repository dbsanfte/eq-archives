Alright so I misinterpreted your original remark as averaging 3-5 
seconds. My bad, I guess but isn't really the average time what's 
interesting? :)

Procs the same no matter what mob since it is unresistable 75-150 
damage, which is good when exping but bad when farming greens.. :) For 
the record though, they all conned dark blue to me at 56. They were also 
undead making the hammer effectivly 24dmg 18dly (it's 14dmg 18dly with 
10 dmg bonus to undead) which ups my actual melee damage a bit. Didn't 
bother with MoR since they were always slowed or pet since the fights 
were rather short, when I had mana to spare I'd just toss in a nuke 
(Judgement).

It doesn't seem to have an enormous amount of taunt, aggro pingponged a 
lot between me, shammy (chaining jbb) and shammy pet. Not that it 
matters that much on a 75% slowed exp mob but if I wanted to get aggro 
I'd use stuns, especially since the proc is so random it can't really be 
counted on.
