There's a message with the title "Champagne enema" that
contains a javascript code which will open an infinite
number of web browser windows (all with the same website)
if you have your web browser set to show HTML.

His message is a warning not to open that message, and
he's calling whoever posted it an asshole.

But yeah, he was awfully cryptic about it.
