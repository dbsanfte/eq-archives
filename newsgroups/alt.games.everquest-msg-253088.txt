Well, not much in the way of helpful tips.

I understand that many are likely tired of hearing about people with
high level toons who don't know how to play them.  Perhaps I fit in
that category for a while but I understand the purpose and role of
every class in EQ so I don't stay in that category long.

I've leveled my monk to 64 and my wizard to 55. I've played a friends
63 pally on a raid a well as a 58 cleric. I'm not unfamiliar with
gaming mechanics for either melee or caster.  Necro is first pet class
but I think I have the pet down, it's mostly high end strategy that I
still need work on.  I've read many posts and forums on this for the
necro but just need to put some into play now.

My original request was for solo areas for plat so I can get some
better gear for the higher end play.  Any tips on that would be
helpful.  I have all expansions but LoY.

Thanks.

~F
