Hi Bjarke;

Thanks for the suggestion. I might need to do it that way. My current EQ2 
setup was installed on a "D" drive. My new comp, all stuff will be installed 
on a "C" drive.  If there are any pathways embedded in EQ2 during 
installation, I wonder if they would carry over the "D" drive path, if I 
install game first on "C" then copy my old files over the new installation 
from a "D" drive?

Just trying to avoid the time sink of install / patch. Maybe I better do it 
that way and avoid any potential problems.

Blaahhh.....

Doctorzoid.
