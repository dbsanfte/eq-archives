It has always been my theory that before these people were taught the 
proper use of apostrophes, they never used them at all. This would have 
led to "Jimmys ball is on the ground" etc. This, of course, would have 
been met with howls of derision, and possibly even a rap on the knuckles 
from the english teacher. As a way of curing this, without actually 
learning the correct way, these guys just put in an apostrophe whenever 
they see an "s". Maybe the spectre of their english teacher is still 
hanging on the shoulder of their subconscious.
