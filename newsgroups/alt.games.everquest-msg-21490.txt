Some things I do that most clerics don't.  I like the stress factor, I use
complete heal, I also use the word, AOE heal, and celestial heal.  I use the
HP buff, Resolution, for heals on casters and to top people off.  Fear or
root is always up for crowd control, I have even used effectively the AOE
fear, usually clears the field for an evack.  I use DA for the cast time and
the mana cost, it will allow me to mem gate or zone if need be, that spell
has saved me more times than I can count.

1 offensive spell
2,3 buff spells, always rotating around
4 celestial heal
5 complete heal
6 fear, sometimes root
7 AOE heal
8 DA

travel mode
 I will remove the AOE and complete heal and trade them for gate and root.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of
your walks."
