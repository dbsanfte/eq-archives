Meh, I never spam slow / malo any more.  Playing my shaman, that is the
first thing I am going to do to the mob? But how do you know if it resisted?
Cos its beating on me...

Actually, to digress, I think mainly the shaman who are getting beaten on
are leading with slow, or have uber crappy tanks.  I lead with malo-x until
it sticks then slow, much less aggro this way. I can usually get a resist,
then slow (which is rare as they are always malo-x'd) and still rarely get
aggro.

But ya, hotkey spam sucks, I dont have incoming message anymore either, if I
am not in camp, I am getting a mob, if I get adds '2' works fine for me (or
'ioh fcuk I thik i got a fwe her!')complete with crappy, have just pulled 6
krigers, spelling)).
