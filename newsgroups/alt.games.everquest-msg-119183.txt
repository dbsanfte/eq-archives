You sure it wasn't the timing of her FD? If you FD in the middle of a
mob's swing at you (so that the same attack still hits you after
you're fully down), there is a large chance that the mob will "notice"
that you're not really dead and thus not be fooled by the FD even
though it passed the skill check. Best thing is to FD immediately
after taking a hit...
