Not often, sometimes.

Plus, recent patch extensions have been posted on the Sony boards.

Same difference.

Indeed, and I'm not trying to offer you one, I'm venting about your 
constant venting.

Yep, but it's a public forum, so if you post you're expecting a 
response.  You're posting so that someone reads it.

People who could fix it hear the feedback on the boards and have already 
commented, but you don't read the boards /shrug.

The boards aren't crap.  There's plenty of valuable content.  They 
suffer the same signal to noise ratio issues that many forums suffer, 
but using the right tools and spending a bit of time allows you to find 
useful information and help people who don't know as much about the game.

Also, they often post patch progress information either as posts or in 
the status.

I'm not trying to.  You rant because you want to and you know it won't 
fix anything, I rant because I want to and I know it won't fix anything.

This is normal in patches where they release a few fixes and do a lot of 
testing, and don't do maintenance on the login servers.  It's been 
happening on and off for quite a while, mostly while you weren't playing 
it would seem if you think it's new.

The login server is usually down for reasons other than the actual 
patching, they don't turn it off to prevent logins, they use the patches 
to do maintenance on it.  It's often that case that for long patch 
durations which involve Q&A being logged in to the servers you can get 
past login to the server selection and see them locked.  Don't get used 
to it, it's not an improvement.

> Who's contributing less?

Neither of us, we're both contributing something or nothing depending on 
your point of view.
