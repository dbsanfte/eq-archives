On the contrary, he demonstrated that he is no stranger to over-clocking 
his processor/FSB. Doing so could quite possibly *require* attention to 
more capable cooling tactics to maintain system stability.

Not specifically, but you *will* see them from machines that have been 
over-clocked, necessitating the use of better cooling techniques.

While you certainly have a point, I wouldn't necessarily agree that it's 
illustrated in this case. If you've ever really put some effort into 
tweaking a PC to get every last FPS out of it that you possibly can, you 
know that all cooling aspects are quite important. The thermal grease you 
use on the CPU and motherboard chipset can be the difference between 
getting an extra several hundered MHz out of the CPU and having to settle 
for far less or even stock speeds.
