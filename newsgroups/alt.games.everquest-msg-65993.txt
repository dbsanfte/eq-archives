I wish I had this spell when I was 19. Whooosh. The non aggro of
celestial heal of time, on those mega unrest trains. Woulda helped
emensly. And since rememdy, I'm sure has fast cast time.

It lowers AC too, but how like you said, how many undead last over two
minutes at level 29.

This would be awesome for AE groups. Sometimes the chanter can't hold
them all, even with 3 color stuns going.  Resists, fizzles and
interupts can mess up the cycle. Be cool to have a backup stun, until
chanter get colors going again. And not much mezzing going on with the
wizzes nuking, so the damage is a bonus :)    I will definatly find
use for this spell !!   Bet it eats mana tho.
