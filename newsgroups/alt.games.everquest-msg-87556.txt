I heard through guild channel two similar stories like your.
1 - Guilde leader was trading 4 bags full of stuff, went LD. logged
back, bags are gone. He petitioned and got his stuff back
2 - Guildmate traded a LSoEE for a Defiance and went LD during the
trade. The other party got the LSoEE and the Defiance is nowhere to be
found in his inventory/bags. He send me a tell asking for help. I told
to petition. Next day I logged back, he told me that the GM got him his
Defiance back.

Good luck. I hope you will retrieve your items/bags!
