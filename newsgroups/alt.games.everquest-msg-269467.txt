Yes newbie, you've proven that you can do google searches, and your very
proud of that, in a special-olympics-kind-of-way. We are all truly in awe of
your skills... we know how hard it is to do searches on google (its why that
site is never used, nobody can figure the damn thing out)....

Back to reality: WHATS YOUR FUCKING POINT?  To summarize: your were wrong
about the term "buffbot", and not that anyone cares, but your wrong again
claiming that I sold two characters. I'm amazed you can fit both your feet
in your mouth at the same time.

If you'd like more info this site will clarify things for you in detail. You
may want to take notes :
