I have no problem with this.  The person is paying for two
accounts and working hard to run both machines.  I consider
the extra exp the reward for working hard.  The person is
being handed nothing for free.

Verant could prevent this if they really wanted to.

Again, this is someone working hard and being rewarded for
working hard.  What's wrong with this?  The person is being
handed nothing for free.

That's a defeatist attitude which also happens to be wrong.
Two of your examples above involved someone working hard.
There is nothing wrong and everything right with rewarding
people for working hard.

Your PL'ing example is a good example that Verant could
improve the game in that area.  I'm not sure how it lessens
my points re: the bazaar.

How many times do I have to tell people I have 24/7 Internet
broadband access?  Jesus Christ, pay attention.
