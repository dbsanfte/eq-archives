I'll toss in another specific case.  My lover raids frequently with a 65
cleric with about every AA you can get for mana pool extention and a 300
wis.  We did a fight recently with a beastie that has an AOE with a 650
point DD and a 100/tick DOT (disease curable).  How do you deal with such a
thing?  Leave one cleric out of the CH chain, after the disease hits, MGB
the cure to the raid, then another cleric with similar AAs dropped out and
my love took their place and that cleric used her MGB the same way...
repeat.

So, you think you could do this - take your place in a CH chain for a few
rounds, then step out and do a MGB on an expensive spell, then step back in
and continue the CH chain while another cleric drops out for their turn - on
a minimal mana pool?  Notta chance.  For a cleric who intends to do anything
more serious than PoS minis, you will NEED every point of mana you can get
(along with every AA you can get to make heals cheaper, more efficient, and
longer lasting).
