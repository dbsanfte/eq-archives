No drop and attunable do the same thing and better, without putting extra
pressure on the players.

You cant make a claim like that in today's Everquest, as there is no steady
item accumulation rate.  The helm that I'm currently wearing was the first
piece of Velious quest armor I ever completed, back in late 2001.  I'm still
wearing that piece of armor today, September 2004.  I simply have not had
the opportunity to loot a better helm. (In this same length of time, some
slots have gone through 6 - 10 changes.)   Yet you say under your item decay
system, that helm would still be good to wear, after almost three years of
solid use.

I say again, if your decay rate is set this low, it's pointless other than
to add a bit more stress to the player using the item.    If it's not that
low, then you will have items that players worked very hard for rotting away
without a decent replacement.
