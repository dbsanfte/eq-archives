Many people think mana regen rate is med_skill/10 mana/tick.  That was
pretty close the one time I measured it.  So, someone with 200 med skill
would get back 150 mana in 48 seconds.

Also, remember that you can med while dealing with merchants bankers.  Just
sit first, then open the merchant or banker window.  Many people overlook
this.
