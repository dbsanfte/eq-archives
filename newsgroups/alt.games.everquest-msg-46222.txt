A question on upgrades for you, Orlun or any one else who has
suggestions.

I am a 41 rogue in near full ravenscale, with a rygorr bracer and helm. 
I am currently wielding SCH and either a crystal grinder or a tombcarver
(depending on availability of a haste buff)  What should i be looking
for, both weapon and armor upgrade wise at this point.  Not sure what
the next step up is from the SCH.  I am assuming armor wise that
Myrolokar (or however the hell you spell that too many consonant armor)
is probably what I will be looking for, but I know there are some nice
drops/quests in Velious also.  Usual adventure group is two shaman and a
warrior, but do sometimes get into pickup groups.  Currently in GD been
doing tizmaks, and recently switched to giants, drakkel dire wolves. 


Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions
