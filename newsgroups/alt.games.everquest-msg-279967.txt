Many of the pre-elemental zones have an alternate flagging method, that 
has existed actually since PoP was introduced.  This alternate method 
allowed you access to the zone in question, but did not give you the 
progression flag.  It would allow you to zone into Tactics for example, 
but, you still would need to do the progression mobs leading up to 
Tactics, if you wanted to get elemental flagged, unless you were 85/15ed 
into a raid on an elemental god.

The new backflagging alternative that was added (well, not so new now), 
was that by joining a raid that kills the boss mob of a zone, you can get 
the flag for that zone, if you do not already have it, at least that's 
how it works for elemental zones.  I admit to not being familiar with the 
pre elemental backflagging alternative methods (if such exist).
