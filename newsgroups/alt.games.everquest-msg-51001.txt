Hello everyone,

This is very weird, but I'm hoping there are some everquest/video geeks in
here to help me out with the situation :)  The problem is that I had
installed Windows 98 and EQ and all the latest drivers for my hardware
(which I will list below).  EQ ran fine for a good while then one day I was
inside Kaladim doing some stuff and I went to the zone exit (to go out to
BB) and when I did I noticed everything to terribly choppy, and once I
stepped out into the wide open area all the graphics and textures started
disappearing and eventually all I could see was sky everywhere, and the
flames from torches and NPCs, I couldn't see anything else, it was all sky.
Can anyone please help? I've formatted the computer and reinstalled Windows
ME and it does the same exact thing.  Now I will list the hardware and the
current driver versions below.

Geforce 2 Ultra - Nvidia reference 21.83 from nvidia.com
SB Live! Value - Latest drivers from Creative.com
512mb RDRAM (Will ME handle this much memory?)
I also am using the latest Intel drivers for my motherboard.
Windows ME is up to date completely from Windows Update.

Thank you for any help!
