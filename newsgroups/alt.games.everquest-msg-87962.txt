I'm hoping that you were not running norton, even in the background,
while trying to get into EQ. Virus programs and the like are bad for
games like this, besides you don't need to have it running then. Not
sure why you need to run norton antivirus automatically anyway when
you screen stuff coming in. What I do is run a virus program sometimes
or automatically when DL'ing stuff with an IE download accelerator, I
use fprotect dos.. it scans the thing and gets out leaving nothing
behind.

For my email program I simply only make it so it can execute jpg and
gif files with a seperate graphics program. I don't even open or read
html mail in fact I've disabled it.

I'd check the norton logs of what it did during the day.. sounds odd.
