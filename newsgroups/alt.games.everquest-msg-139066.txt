Hey guys, I am getting to choosing specialisation with my mage. I solo most
of the time and am wondering whether to go with Conjuration or Evocation for
specialization. I went with evocation with my last mage but I was also
grouping for the most part. I would appreciate any advice and if you would
like to see my mage's gear it is:

If anyone has any gear upgrade advice I'm open for that too.
Thanks.
I am also being PL'ed as I hate mid levels on any class. I have played a
high level mage so I'm not going to be a PL'ed caster who does not have any
idea what he's doing
