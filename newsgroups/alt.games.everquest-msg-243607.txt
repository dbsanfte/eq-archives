Everquest. Duh.

What would you call it otherwise? An apricot? Sally? Beethoven's 10th?

Hm. If Tom Cruise walks down a flight of stairs in Mission: Impossible, 
or if he walks down a flight of stairs in his Beverly Hills house, how 
is it different? It isn't, but at the same time, it is. One is the real 
world, and the other is not. I hope I don't need to elaborate on which 
is which.

Dude, I buy WIRED every month too, so there is no need to go all 
Nicholas Negroponte on me, I've heard it all before. I'm not arguing 
that the Everquest economy will develop trends that mimic economic 
trends in the real world, this is obvious. The issue here is whether 
real world economy impinging into the EQ economy is good for the game. 
It isn't.

Well, because if they did I would cancel my account right there and then, 
and while I don't presume that Sony is all that worried about *my* 
custom, I dare say that there are enough people who agree with me to 
make it an uneconomical proposition.

Having said that, it would be amusing to see what Norrath would look 
like if it were populated exclusively by plat farmers.

If that's your idea of "fun", allow me to recommend There, Inc. <http://

Precisely. I don't want to play in a world in relation with our own, I 
want to play in a world separate from it.
