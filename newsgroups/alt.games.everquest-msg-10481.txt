Sorry... but this IS a KS :o(... but only on a technicality...

If it doesn't agro on you after an attack (even if you miss) then it's
already BEEN attacked successfully... and so you're joining a fight in
progress.

There's also the issue of mob health... just because YOU can see it's at
full health, doesn't mean it still IS at full health... the lag between you
and the server means some mobs can be as low as 20% and still show a full
health bar to a new opponent.

I wouldn't worry about it all, tho... just sounds like a genuine
misunderstanding, and I wouldn't start placing any blame. If the other guy
can't accept that, then that's his problem.
