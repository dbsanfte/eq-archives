Yes its very fast for instance;
two days ago I spent 3 hours camping bazaar and found the following:

Wristsnapper 900p
Reaver 12,500p
ORB 2hs 900p

Sold withing 1 day at;
Wristsnapper 1900p (2500p max price but like fast turn over)
Reaver 18,500p (again max is about 21,000 but turnover the key)
ORB 1600p

So in one day thats 7,700p from 3 items. Much better return then
camping items from mobs. In fact orginal owners are the best source of
bargains sine they have little in the way of cash invested. This is
from T Zek not exactly a busy bazaar. Pick one item catagory and learn
it, weapons seem to bring the highest yield with fast turnover. Next
is armor then jewlery(odds and ends) and caster stuff. I dislike
caster stuff as the classes are not driven by equipment as much as
melee and they seem picky to me. I avoid priest stuff like the plague
seems they have the least to spend of anyone till very high levels or
else too many are simple heal bots that dont rate good gear beyond
KEI. Now KEI is prob the reason caster stuff is harder to turn than
melee but who knows.
