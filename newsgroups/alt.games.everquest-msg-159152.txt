Ok... if I remember correctly that is the npc that does the meditate
thing and tells you what flags you have set already.
I did that and its NO help... tells me something I already know.
She doesn't tell you who to talk to or how to get any flags set.
That is what I was asking.. who to I talk to get a flag set.

Specifically for the plane of air.. as that was the place I wanted to
go to.
