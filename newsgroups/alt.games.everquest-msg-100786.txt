Just as an FYI, heads up kind of thing, I download my email this morning
and get an EQ related "surprise".  Now, I normally get the usual amount
of spam, adverts, etc. which I tag and mass delete without reading. But
there's one note from somebody I don't know with the word "Guildremove"
in the subject line. (Forget exactly what it said). Since I don't know
of any use of that word besides EQ, I go ahead and open it. 

Norton is set to scan all my mail before doing anything with it, and it
immediately jumps up and flags this one as containing a virus and
quarantines it. There was an attachment in the note called "command.com"
if you can fucking believe that. The text of the note was short and just
appeared to be a cut/paste from one of the eqsupplement manuals about
guild commands. No actual content.

The sender was under the name Nathan Beeman, though that's doubtless a
bullshit name.

So, just in case you get something similar in the e-mail, you've been
warned. I didn't bother running full scan to see *which* virus it was, I
just whacked it.
