Um, never played a Necro either...  Okie doke, from here on out, dots get sold
right along with the rest of the loot and everyone gets an equal share...  No
special consideration given for dots at all since they really don't drop all
that often as it is and would be unfair to give one to Cleric and not to
Chanter or Necro if they are in group as well...

Thank you for speaking up, otherwise I wouldn't have known...  I just assumed
your pets were all about the bonechips...  :)
