Again, great analysis of monks vs. Rogues.  The main difference I see in
what you had vs. my proposed group is time.  If Bard was exchanged for one
Rogue he can pull faster than pulling with snare.  (Bards can outrun
anything too, no chance of him being caught up with by even SoW'ed mobs.)
Rogue damage is better than monk damage but only if u can guarantee a back.
This scheme does, so more damage per melee round and faster kill.  Resists
would ruin the Druid's day but Shaman would guarantee that it would not AND
have the speed/strength to ensure his debuff sticks before the fray even
begins.  Last, no need to med at all with the chosen casters.  They regen
mana better than anyone.
