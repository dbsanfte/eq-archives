Using new models you will most likely start getting below 30 fps once 18
people are on screen during a raid. But with the old models w/ velious
textures you can handle 60 or so people before your fps starts dipping below
30 fps.

Frames per section in EverQuest is different from other games, theres no
real benchmark really. But if you want to see your fps in this game get
fraps from www.fraps.com. Saying that with an athlon xp 2000 w/768 ram and
geforce3 ti 200 I average 70FPS in most guild raids at 1280*1024*32.

Then theres also your datarate. If you have cable/dsl set it to 8 or 9 and
you won't have any lag problems. Leaving your datarate at 5 and playing a
melee is risky. As when an npc in a 30 player raid gets enrage if you turn
off attack the server won't register your request immediately which could
cause you to die. Setting it to 8/9 allows the game to give you more
bandwidth and no lag during raids assuming your system is decent fps (30+).

I play on Tribunal aswell, level 51 rogue named bangbak - southern legion
guild.
