i really want to start to make drinks (after getting raped by the orcish
camp west of freeport, ive decided to just lay low untill i can level up)

first and foremost, how do i start to learn to brew? i have a water flask
and 2 grapes (according to a book i purchaseda water flask and 2 fruits are
needed to make a berry drink) but i have no clue as to make them into a
drink

any tips and/or suggestions on the best places to lean how to brew?

thanks
-Dan
