Last weekend we went to City of Mist to beat on black reavers.  If you've
been there before you know that they're 100% magic resistant (though a level
60 druid did say he did about 25 damage with a fire spell! :)  Maybe wizards
would have better luck?).  The heals were well covered so I ended up casting
my best haste (56 enc) on EVERYONE who had a weapon showing and were just
sitting around doing nothing.

I think I did about 50-70 damage to every reaver...got my 1hb from 99 to
110!  Totally a waste of time, but I  had absolutely nothing else to do and
it was fun how he'd occasionally thwap me, as if I were a danger to him. <g>
