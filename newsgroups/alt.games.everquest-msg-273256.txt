Your not much for in depth stories then are ya? I suppose if it had pictures
your opinion might have been different?

Anyway I found Bob's story captivating and almost felt a part of it, could
imagine the fear, and awwe. The detailed descriptions of each room and/or
area is what generaly brings life to a story.

4 Stars...Great short story.
