Thanks for all this detail, I was unable to get in to the standard
eqcastersrealm today, where I expect this info is cataloged... it
just kept seizing up.

I went to the FV vendor and picked up every spell she has, filled
a deluxe sewing kit with the 52-59 ones and shoved them in the
bank for later.  Turns out that the Cabalis West location the
firepot dumps you in is out of aggro range of guards, and right
at the LOIO entrance.  Knowing how slow the guards out there are,
I probably could have just streaked by them on TBoot and never
seen em blink, but my storebought Invis potion held out so that
wasn't an issue.  Total elapsed time from Freeport bank to FV,
20 minutes, including stopping to buy a backup potion.

Aye, Remedy being the "needed" spell for 51, I'm much more satisfied
to just keep an eye out for the others while I play.

I"m already used to being asked to go to Seb at 50... while hunting in CS.
Thus far I haven't felt up to trying it, I have the key, but I've so enjoyed the

peacefulness of CS interspersed with the havoc of Siren's Grotto or
Kael Drakkar that I"m reluctant to return to a Kunark zone.

Yep, someone came by our raid party and Aegolism'd in Kael a couple
days back, he got -way- more milage out of the ten peridots I handed him
than I ever would have.  Lots more HP and lasted two hours!  Sucked down
some serious mana, of course, but we got the mod rod and heal pumps
working like we were all being resed without a stick and had him off and
running again in minutes.

Got the key, didn't get any spells at the time... but then there was a whole
raid of us working, and I was only around 40th, spells likely went to the
more deserving.

Skyfire ick... but that's just from several excursions there to repeatedly
res some hapless friends.  Never hunted there myself.
