I think that is the root cause of the problem.  Further down the thread
it is stated that the poster believes it isn't the kids with rich
parents who are buying plat or would be purchasing items.  I agree with
that, the 'kids' with 'rich' parents have no responsibilities and can
devote as much time to the game as they want (outside of school I
suppose, unless they are also home-schooled).  The people who have
full-time jobs and families that can't devote as much time to camping a
mob are the ones that would benefit from buying items.  I think offering
them the items they can't get for a price they will pay for won't
destroy the game, but help it.
