ME TOO! <AOL>  *smiles*

I got hold of all the spells last night (cue spell-book re-org) and they 
seem insanely useful.

Grimling Forest - Yep, right next to the vendors.  Perfect place to Gate to
to sell loot when MLing, then go back to where you were raiding.

Dawnshroud - Close to the Rockhopper caves and ME.  So, when organising
any form of ME group, just hop around Norrath picking people up and Portal
straight there.  Brilliant!

Tris.
