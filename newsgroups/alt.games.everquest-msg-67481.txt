That's the full extent of the nerf.  Before it was useable by "All" races,
and now it's not useable by the cats (only).

As there's no actual reason for the change, I expect it will be "fixed"
about the same time the first cat hits 60.  The reasoning behind it is
obvious.  Too bad that the true "racers" are all sitting in front of level
60 druids and aren't bothered a bit by the fungi tunic change.  The
penalized people are the ones that don't want to PL, but would rather get a
boost while actually playing.
