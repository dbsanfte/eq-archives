 That's Astral Projection. He's for the Monk Epic quest along with the
other Astral Projection in the scorpikii canyon in Overthere. For the
one in Ill Omen you need levitate to get up there. But yes, they are
tagged as merchants and will buy stuff from you. They don't have
anything to sell except for what people have sold to them.
