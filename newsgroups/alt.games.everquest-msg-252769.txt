>Is there anyone here that has some FACTS about which dungeon is the
>best/worst and why? Bottom line is, why does everyone goes to BB?

To get the best stuff you need to focus on a single dungeon. 500
points in a single dungeon buys better loot than 500 points spread
evenly about. So most people decide that they have to focus on a
single dungeon. Which explains why the others are so deserted, and
also breeds a level of familiarity and complacency.

As to why it was Mistmoore Catacombs and not some other one? The big
reason is that almost all of the MOBs in the dungeon are undead. This
means that Clerics and Pallys are quite effective there. Also for some
reason people believe that the loot you can buy from the adventure
camp is slightly better in Butcherblock. There is an aug with Regen 1
on it, for the low price of 40 Adv. Points. There is also some really
nice Nec, Enc, Wiz, Mag armor on the top end.

Personally I got so bored with Mistmoor Catacombes that for a while I
refused to do them. However I eventually started looking for some
upgrades to my equipment (that was looking pretty sorry at the time).
I found some really nice Shaman useable armor at the reasonable price
of 442 Adv. Points each. The AC on the items is probably only avarage
for the other classes that can use it, but for a Shaman it's pretty
awesome. Better than most equipment you can get until Planes raid
encounters. So, now I find myself in the position of turning down
Adventures not in MMC... I can't wait until I get 450 Adv. Points in
MMC, then I can adventure elsewhere and use the points there.
