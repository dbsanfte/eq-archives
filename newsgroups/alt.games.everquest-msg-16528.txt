There is no more negative Qeynos faction for handing Gnoll fangs to
the Capt. in Qeynos arena. I just tried it lastnite and nothing
dropped I know it used too. Now I do think if you hand in the
Moonstones he gives you tothe fella in the bar near the port there is
a faction drop. But none for just handing in the gnoll fangs.
