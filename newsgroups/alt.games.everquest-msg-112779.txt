This hardly seems to be a warrior problem.   In my experience, within a week
or two of getting your epic is the most popular time to quit the game forever,
for any class.  We've had a bard, a shadowknight, a cleric and a few others go
this way.   Odd that it seems to happen more with the harder epics than the
easier ones.
