But the entire idea of "meditating" really doesn't work in practice
even on the worldy side of things. A worldy mechanic can be non-fun as
long as it is an investment of some kind towards a form of future fun
- travelling is a good example, those willing to invest in the
less-fun travel (though optimally the travel should also be fun if it
can be managed) reap the rewards of going somewhere other people don't
dare or can't be bothered to go... if the game is set up this way in
the first place (example: Sebilis in Kunark era was a pain in the arse
to get to, it was a long run from the boat zones, and if you got a
port to DL you had to run to KC for another port to EJ - but if you
were willing to put up with all that, sebilis exp and loot was an
order of magnitude better than the alternative KC). However, there was
no payoff to blind meditating. It was just annoying. Even from the
worldy point of view, the player should always be looking at the
screen, not reading a book, while they're playing.

Btw people truly practiced at meditating can do it anywhere with
virtually anything going on around them.
