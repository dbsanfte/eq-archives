Paineel is a pain to hunt in.  The guards are undead but see thru IVU
as well as thru normal invis, yet like normal gate guards they are
buffed to extraordinary levels for their relative level... if you can
kill them to get in, you won't get exp for it.  Unless you really want
to commit to the zone in a big way, you'll have to be able to get
in past them again, naked, if you should happen to die.

COTH is one way in, of course, and then there's dying and getting
a drag in.  Niether is very attractive as options go, they require
a high level mage buddy or, well, death.

Since killing things in Paineel gives you bad Heretic faction, even
if you went in the easy way by having the faction to let you walk
in, you'll be screwing it quickly enough if you hunt there.  Once inside,
as often happens in cities, the good level mobs mingle heavily with
greens and reds, and its difficult to find spots to fight in where
you aren't going to be mobbed by one or the other... .green mobs
mean wasted energy, while red mobs mean evac... and don't even
-think- about running to zone, since you'll be adding in those gate
guards and have to wait for the elevator!

Compare this to Ogguk, where you can use puppy form to wander
around, and are in many cases not KOS to the vendors or banker,
just the guards.  Great hunting there, really fun.  Easy run to zone if
things go out of control, its an outdoor zone so you can harmony,
SOW, whatever you like.  Plus, Ogre bouncers are -such- fun to kill!
Can dropping another skellie pet really compare to that?

Paineel isn't deserted because people refuse to support verant
having made a new zone, its deserted because it -sucks-... so
do most cities, though.
