When I read this, I understood it differently; I thought it meant all 
classes with taunt will get a message telling them whether they succeded 
or not, rather than "everyone will know whether the warrior's taunt 
succeded", or even "everyone will know with each taunt anyone does 
whether it was a success or not"

Now that I read your post, I'm not sure which of the three it is... and 
this also means I no longer think I know whether the message is for just 
warriors or whether its for everyone.

There's a scene in the movie Clue in which Col Mustard is unable to get 
the butler to answer his question having to do with how many people are 
in the house, thats what I'm reminded of every time I meet a response 
like this that fails to answer the question.

Splendid
