Irrelevant. My lack of KEI is still not hampering my group. I'd be
able to do more with it, but it's not hampered by my lack.

As I mentioned originally, I would always explain why I was refusing.
You are confusing me with the OP. Don't.

I need to prove nothing to you. People in this newsgroup have seen
some of my high level characters, including high profile posters like
Jazz and georg. Others have grouped with me on Test. What I say stands
on its own merit without needing to boast about my characters, and
everyone here with the experience required to realize it knows it.

And I'm sure we're all real impressed. What that response came from
was your belief that not having KEI was a disservice - something
undesirable enough to deny acceptance - to the group.

And yet, when presented with actual numerical evidence of why you are
wrong, you still hold to your opinion on the basis of one lame
defense: the enchanter wouldn't have to downgrade hastes if they had
KEI.

See why KEI became relevant?

Logic and evidence have been provided, but they appear to have no
effect on your granitelike intellect. Remember those lists of things
an enchanter had to do? Remember the actual numerical mana
calcluations?

Remember your lone response? "Why don't you have KEI?"

You indicated grouping without KEI was unacceptable to you.

We haven't forgotten your "you must have KEI!". It is, indeed, the
crux of why people are pointing out your inexperience in commenting on
this. This attack on KEI is not a tangent, it is relevant to your
argument.

And this is relevant how. The point remains that chain pulling as
enchanter and parking while waiting for something to die is SOP, and
quite easy to do without KEI. People also do it with roots.

You are so dependent on KEI you don't know what people who've been
around since beforehand can do without it.

There's nothing wrong with getting KEI. There's something wrong with
people who think it's necessary and believe not getting it means the
player isn't fulfilling their duties. That's the new breed of player.
That's you. And as everyone else here has pointed out it's part of why
the newer people are way behind in skills compared to those who did
without.

One of the first 60s on Tholuxe (getting there just a week or two
after me) was, in fact, an erudite shadowknight who soloed during
offtimes.

When Tholuxe was in its 'level up' era, there was no KEI. There wasn't
even a Velious.

How did he manage to do what you just described as unviable, I wonder?
Could it be your standards for viability are too high?

Into the spin cycle now are we? Disservice, by any common usage,
indicates you are doing something *unwelcome* to someone else.

Are you now trying to backtrack? You made it abundantly clear earlier
that you felt it was a duty of the caster to show up with KEI and if
they didn't they shouldn't even try to group. Your own quotes will be
provided if you try to deny it.

KEI is a luxury, not a right or a necessity.

And you expect everyone else to have this standard? That's why you're
getting laughed out of the building. So many of us here have played
and leveled without KEI, we *know* it's not necessary. Nice to have.
Not necessary.

Then why the song and dance?

Yes, you were. Up until the last post you were still boggling over an
enchanter casting augmentation over alacrity.

When you say something like this it makes me wonder what your groups
do if they stay together long enough in one spot (inconveniently
located to rebreak to, if there are any spots like that at your level)
to have KEI drop.

Do you ask the group to leave or take them all to nexus because you
might have to be more mana conscious?.

It's good that you remembered this at the end. I'll go back and snip
out some of the more edgy comments.
