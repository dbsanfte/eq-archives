Would have made it cheaper than buying it here in Aust.

If you haven't purchased Planes of Power and are thinking of doing so,
Amazon.com has a HUGE deal on it.
The purchase price on PoP there is $24.88, but you can get a mail in
rebate for $20.00!

This is a good deal even with a small shipping charge!  I highly
recommend anyone looking for a deal to check this out!

Link to the mail in rebate offer is:

It is good until the 23rd of February, so don't delay :)
