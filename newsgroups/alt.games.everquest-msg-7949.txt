This has happened to my friend a few times when camping in Overthere.  My
guess is the camp doesn't put him where it should and since he's on a really
high mountain he winds up falling through the ground.  

He just petitions a GM.  His body ends up in a safe zone and they give him
an exp res (obviously a game glitch.)
