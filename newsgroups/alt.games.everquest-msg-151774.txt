Er, only at 56 and Higher.... show me a cleric below that has higher
DPS, and well Ill want to be that cleric eheh

back to the mana thing... and I wont repeat it for the below
classes... each in turn need mana to do their thing...

necro and shammy and mage are the few who have the abiltiy to use
magic to convert Health to mana, Ill agree with them being not 100%
mana dependant.

Personaly I consider them Hybrid's...  but thats jut my opinion...
they Melee and cast very well indeed.

Lets not forget that Oh so awesome hammer all keep mentioning does not
come until level 56... now compair your level 52 wiz with a 52
cleric... Hell  even a 55 cleric...  the wiz will handle the situation
with much more ease...  
Yet... hmm both are 100% mana dependant.
