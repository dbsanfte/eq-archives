This works partially for me, I deleted the C:\EverQuest\Userdata
directory (where the suspect CJ*.* journal files are being written
every time you zone or die) and it allows me to cross one or two zones
before reverting to the YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED mantra once again.

I wish I could work out why this only happens on dial-up and not ADSL
though.  Not half as much as I wish I could get ADSL up and running
again mind you. ;)
