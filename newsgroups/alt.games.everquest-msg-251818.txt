Casting no0w forces a stand... This is a nice feature in my opinion, as it 
cuts down on clutter to the server (assuming the client does not just 
automatically send /stand in the background)

There's an autostand feature now too when you move. You can turn it off in 
Options. I imagine it is a welcome addition to any kiting druids or 
whatever, as the old run-5-secs-sit-tick-stnad routine is a little easier.

I think it works with /cast but I don't know for sure- all my macros still 
have /stand in 'em.
