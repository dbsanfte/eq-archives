I know the feeling *g* Personally I HATE tanking as a rogue.  I mean, 
besides the fact that I get hurt a lot ;) there's the fact that to do 
the real damage, I have to be *behind* the mob.  I'm at my happiest when 
I'm mashing my "backstab" button and watching cleric_01 slapping his 
"greater healing tank_01" hotkey.

Ryou
(there's also the fun of duelling and listening to the tank tell you 
over and over "STOP !@#$!#@$ HIDING!!!!!!!!!!!!")
