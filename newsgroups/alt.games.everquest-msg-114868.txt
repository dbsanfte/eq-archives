I never discuss my financials with anyone other than my accountant.  Purely
business.

Of course.  I would never compare that  to leveling in EQ, though.

I have never shouted DING! to strangers on the street.  I never discussed
wedding plans with the guy who sold me a shirt last week.  I refuse to
discuss finances with my postal delivery person, etc.  I don't see the
*reason* to shout DING to a bunch of strangers.  Announcing to your guild
(ie in-game friends) or your group is fine.  It's just the *need* for
recognition that I don't understand (esp at the low levels).

Also, never said I was bothered.  On the contrary, I find it a source of
amusement.
