Not acting weird, dumped from game, couldn't log in for 10 min,
couldn't get to website, restarted computer, still couldn't get on to
EQ/Sony but everything else was fine.

Figured someone here might know if it was hacked or something else
happened.

>You've GOT to be new to the game and the internet in general.

New to game, internet no.

> EQ has never (3+ years) been hacked in that way.

I did not know that until this thread. I do know that Battlenet has
been hacked on occasion which is my only other multi-player online
type of game.

Well I wasn't talking about cheat programs. Though it is very nice to
know that you can accept gifts from people without worrying whether
they are duped.

>The internet acts weird all the time.

Indeed it does. But when the only thing I couldn't get to was EQ/Sony
stuff, I found that just a little off.

>There's nothing at all wrong being being a newbie,

Doesn't seem to be the case in this group.

>so if you took offense at

Well not until you posted that last line ;p
