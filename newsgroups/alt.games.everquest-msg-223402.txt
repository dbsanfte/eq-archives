Belated grats to you, Bob :)  I *still* think level 50 is a big deal!  I
know that when I ding 60, most of my guildmates will be rather lukewarm
about it as they've been 60 for ages, but me?  I still do the Happy Butt
Dance when I hit 50.

So I say to you, congrats and good show, mate!  Big milestone.  :)
