	That's not a given.  It's also not a given that having designed a new
missile, an aggressor would be able to upgrade his entire missile arsenal with
the new technology any time soon, if at all.  And it's also not a given that
long-range missiles can't be made obsolete.  Weapons technologies come and go,
and sometimes they go away for good.  ICBMs may someday go the way of cavalry
charges.

	The Soviets went broke trying to keep up with American defense spending.
SDI scared them silly; they knew that if it worked, they could never match the
technology.
