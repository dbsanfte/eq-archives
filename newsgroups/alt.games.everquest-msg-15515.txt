All I can say is....YOU PPL ARE SAD!!!! ;-)
I think we can officially refer to EQ as an addiction now.  When we think of
conning venders in a public amusement park and completing quests.

HEY! WAIT! IDEA COMING ON!!!!

Maybe we can convince Verant to create a theme park based on EQ.
Hidden quests, zones between rides, vendors that never leave their shops,
and .... oh, just a second, bad thought coming on.....

having to take a number to wait 36 hours so you can camp a rare spawn to
complete
the popcorn quest, giving an item to the WRONG vendor and having to recamp
those
36 hours, and worst of all, getting banned from the park for cursing at
those good-for-
nothing low-down 12 year old kill/stealers.....

HEY!!! Now you ppl have me doing it! anyone have the number of a good
shrink?
Preferrably one near the Karanas, so I don't have to rebind!;-)

Have a good trip and bring back some muffins and milk for the rest of us.
(BB stout would
be even better!)
