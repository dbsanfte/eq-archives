What can I say, I don't play a mage, I have a spell list that says it's DD.
So, with the corrections, that makes the druid 3rd best for total amount of
nuke DD, counting the mage focus items for the mage, and still 3rd best on
the ratio.  Still does not change that the OP was talking post 50, not
pre50.  The assertion that clerics, enchanters, and necros have better DD
spells at 44 than a druid at 49 is still incorrect.
