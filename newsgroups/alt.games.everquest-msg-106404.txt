Thank you for pointing out the option of walking from place to place. I have
never played a druid or wizard. When I want to get somewhere, I usually
walk. I can now get to just about any old world area I want to. I have only
been ported a few times and have only asked for a port once, I was turned
down because I needed to get to Kunark and the guy didn't want to put me in
the Dreadlands. The reason I don't ask for ports is because 1) I never have
enough spare money that I would consider fair to the druid/wizard and 2) I
enjoy the travel, I enjoy the risk involved in placing all my equipment in
the bank and then seeing where different paths lead.

Of course, being a Shaman, I can SoW myself at will and thus don't have to
wory as much about the time; but my first explorations of Eastern Antonica
were with my Dwarf Warrior.
