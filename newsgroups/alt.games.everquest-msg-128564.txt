Hi, all

What a terrible level number 13 is for a Druid - I died more than I
did as a lowbie, and it took WEEKS to hit 14  :O  The Mobs you can
(relatively) easily clobber are worth squat, and anything else takes
all your mana, meaning long med periods...

Never mind, I made 14 last night, and can now cast SoW, Levitate and
whatnot for the first time ever, and I'm amazed to say I got quite a
buzz - maybe it was the loooooooong wait :D  

I was so glad to make it, I was casting the above two spells for
newbies/lowbies for free, for the sheer fun of it, and several of us
just ran up and then off cliffs, just for the sensation of flying.  I
am pleased to say I wasn't the only one shouting "Wheeeee!" as I did
so  ;)

Anyone else remember reaching a level where they felt they had
"arrived" in their profession?
