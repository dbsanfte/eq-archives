Thus my reccomendation of shaman; the class which can both heal
like mad -and- tank better than a rogue.  If by "tank" you mean
"take damage" that is.  Shaman spend much of their solo career
standing there letting mobs hit them while their pet dishes out
the damage from behind; a rogue would certainly be more than
capable of pulling his weight in this kill style, and as a bonus
the shaman has haste and other melee buffs to turn the rogue into
a blender.  Note I don't count his Slow as a factor, since its
the slow that enables the shaman tank trick in the first place.

With slow and dots a shaman can generally hang onto aggro if he
wants to, just make sure the rogue isn't taunting (do rogues get
taunt?  If so, why?

Pet classes don't mix well with rogues, since the changes to pet
aggro rules means that the mob will Never prefer a pet if any PC
is in melee range, this condemns the rogue to the role of tank. 
Exceptions would be shaman and beastlord, both of which tend to
tank and let their pet melee from the rear.
