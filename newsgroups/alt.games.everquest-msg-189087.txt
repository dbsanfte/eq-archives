> [8] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and
to
> him that knocketh it shall be opened.

children,

do

> [13] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is
the

or

> [17] Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
> bringeth forth evil fruit.
> [18] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree

> [19] Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast

> [20] Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
> [21] Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the

in

> [25] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
> beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
> [26] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
> shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
> [27] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
> beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
> [28] And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people

> [29] For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
