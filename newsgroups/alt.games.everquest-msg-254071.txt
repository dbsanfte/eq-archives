I've seen this message a lot, and the mob does nothing, even if I'm 
right next to it, if not already aggroed

Yep, this is still a big riddle, what I'd need would be someone with the 
same level, offense, and intimidate but a markedly different (higher or 
lower) kick skill, and a comparison of failures of this sort (as opposed 
to the more usual "you're not scaring" sort)

Might even have to be same class, too, in case some classes use kick 
skill and some don't.

There's a step before step one, which is "now that the intimidate 
sequence is over, is the target in melee range" or something along those 
lines.  If its not, you always fail and never aggro the mob.  But you 
can get skill ups, I got two today alone, in wildly different 
circumstances, intimidating while out of range.
