When I made my bard, charming didn't seem like
an important feature.  I really wanted him as a
melee toy of sorts, saw him as a combat shaman
cross.  I pumped STR and DEX up and left
CHA in the cellar.

While I wish I'd gone with STA, I haven't regretted
the descision to ignore CHA at all so far.  I'm
relying heavily on charm for kiting and for general
crowd control, its got to be one of my most useful
songs... but my poor CHA seems to make no
difference at all.

With my gear on (far from spectacular stuff, mostly
hand me downs and junk loot from my cleric) I have a
stunning 98 CHA.  Yet I stick charm 80 percent of the
time (about the same as any other song) and it almost
never breaks early (three times in the thousand or two
times I've stuck charm its broken early)

I"m using the lowest charm song, sticking to anything from
blues to reds from the point where I got the song (27?)
to current (35)

My familiarity with how EQ spells work in general leads me
to believe there's little room for improvement, this already
seems as reliable as anything my cleric casts on mobs,
and again there doesn't seem to be any less stick or duration
on this than with any of my other targetable songs.

Am I missing something?  Are my feelings that 98 cha is
working fine not born out by general experience?  If
I'm right whats all this with the cult of CHA for bards?

Charming but not charismatic

PS Charm is Wind based... but again I don't see any
difference in stick rate, duration... nothing seems to change
if I use any of my various wind instruments to charm with.
If they did make a difference I'd start swapping in my
flawless horn as I just realized its primary slot item so
I can hot swap over my primary weapon without really
having to juggle.
