To clarify: I was reluctant to play online games because of what I'd
heard about cheating (Diablo), PvP problems (UO) and overcrowding
(UO).

Cheating seems to be a non-issue in EQ, at least as far as I've seen
after three weeks of play. I think Verant has handled the PvP issue
extremely well. Overcrowding hasn't been a huge problem, but I've been
mostly playing during the day.
