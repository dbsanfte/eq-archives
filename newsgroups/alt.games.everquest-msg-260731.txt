When you first boot up, a string of numbers (usually starting with a date) 
and letters will be at the bottom of your screen as long as you have your 
vendor splash screen turned off.. if not..go into your bios (usually DEL or 
F1 when first booting) and turn splash screen off. Your bios will know what 
board you have, you can also run a variety of other programs that will tell 
you.. the best being

but if you don't have a 10 mins at 400K/bits... then you may want to 
consider any other smaller benchmarking utility.
