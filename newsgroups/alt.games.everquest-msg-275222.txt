Actually, you don't own the sidewalk. You are responsible for
maintaining it since it is on your property, but you don't own it.
It's kind of odd, but, not, it's not yours.

The public has the right to walk across the sidewalk through your
property. BUT, they don't have the right to set up a stand and start,
say, collecting petition signatures there.
