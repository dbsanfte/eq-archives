Funny you should mention twinks. I often have people thinking I'm a
twink. They refuse to believe it's possible to have earned so much
gear at a reasonably low level. My warrior gets the same attitude...
he had full crafted at lvl 20. 

Twinking's not for me. If you wanna go that route, then fair enough.
But on the other hand, I'm quite happy to play the merchant and have
each character earn the gear through long hours in EC :-)
