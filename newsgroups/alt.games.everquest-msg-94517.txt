What I got from reading his post was that to <him> his life was more
important than someone else in the zone. I see nothing wrong with that, it
is just being honest. If he left the <him> out of the statement it would
aquire a whole new meaning though.

EQ is many different things to many different people. I pretty much play the
game in single player mode too, and just use the "do unto others" golden
rule. I warn if I can, but don't sweat if I can't. I random buff and heal if
I have nothing better to do but if I am busy I will just watch others die
around me without issue at all.

Anti-social? Maybe, but then the typical type of person that plays EQ I
don't particularily want to socialise with anyway. Heck - if I had the
choice I wouldn't even put up with myself....

Cheers
