Ok fist off the biggest buzz in the sony online area was Star Wars
Galaxies, looks nice , feels like star wars. No lvls and yes everybody
has the chance to be a jedi, none of this 1 out of 200 accounts jedi
enabled rumor. You just have to be really lucky to become a jedi but
every charater you make has the chance. Any way on to EQ.
EQ2 was the next stop on my list. All I can saw is. Goodbye old EQ.
It looks great , I saw the entire Befallen revamp area and it is much
better, fells like a dungeon. Animation were fantasic, was told they
are going to have 100+ emotes and emotes open up in there own window
which of course can be turned on or off. The demo was ON-Line so the
way I saw the static skellys in befallen will be the way the will look
in final or close to it. Not much more to say about EQ2 mostly the
graphics where outstanding and if you guys have seen that screen shot
of that dragon well, it looks like that in game. Huge . scary and i
loved it.

Planes Of Power, OK first off it's not planes like we know it. The
expansion is basically a huge quest. Cool thing  are the features that
are going to get thrown into game. There is a plane callled" The Plane
of Knowledge" a no faction zone so "everybody can come here at any
lvl.
Basically it is a Huge Library where you can go read books about EQ
lore and start this so called quest. This zone acts like a nexus
becuase "ALL" newbie area will have a portal to it. So you can in fact
go from Shar Val to Plane of Knowledge to Freeport or any other newbie
zone. ( i guess it's worth getting just for that feature alone). Also
since these are Planes and we all know what a pain it is to get your
corpse back from one if you die, they have cut down the time it would
take you by have a common graveyard. So if you die on plane and for
some reason nobody can find your body or if you were exploring alone
you can go to this grave yard and click on a tombstone and your corpse
will be summoned to that grave.  Sorry Necro's we won't be paying you
to retrive anymore.
Also Don't you hate going to camp a drop and there's already a chump
ahead of you, worry no more . The zones will be big so there will be
up to 3 of the same NPC in zone and the will randomlly spawn in
different areas every time so no static camps.
No new graphics of any kind except for some added particles for
casters spells .

Oh and I asked the Dev. whats the future of Old EQ he said on the
record ( I was media ) that As long as people play EQ there will be
support but it may get cut back when SWG and EQ2 and Planetside go
on-line. So I expect to see severs get cut or merged.
Off the record the guy said that he "personally" doesn't see it
fesable moneywise to keep old EQ going that much longer after the
other games hit. They expect a huge migration to SWG and EQ2.
And he can't see Sony ( whose number 1 thing is money) keeping eq
going for only Ubers who refuse to move to EQ2 and people who won't
upgrade there PC's. remember these games are slated to come out in O3'
4th quarter (Oct to Dec) so, take that with a grain of salt. And at
the moment they have no plans for further expansions after Planes.
