Had a little jaunt around here the other day. No see invis mobs except
Praetorian Myral and I would expect Grieg Veneficus also (need key for
access to Grieg). All mobs I encountered were snareable, did not summon,
dark blue at 65, hit reasonably hard, pretty easy to solo. Some good kite /
root-rot areas if that your thing. Zone is considered outdoor so SoW / horse
work here. Soldiers of Madness and others seem to spawn out of nowhere which
can pose a few problems if you are in the middle of agro kiting or
something. Loot was ok - plat and gems. All in all liked the zone and will
come back again at some point soon to claim my Scythe of Sundering off
Praetorian Myral!
