I suppose I could just have been lucky and you could have been unlucky. Or
maybe our expectations are different, I don't know.

Anyway, if there is indeed a wide-spread reluctance to participate in group
efforts, making it easier to solo will only make matters worse, one should
think.

Judged by yesterday's patch and announcement, they did listen. Hopefully,
they're not overdoing it.

True, it would be nice to tell from the beginning if a quest has been
designed for soloing.

I have yet to see such a quest, but if you say they exist, I believe you.
But again, grouping is a discipline that you must master to some degree to
play EQ2. I have no problem with that.

If a group decides to kill mobs they could just as easily have killed
individually, they're wasting precious group time. It's their loss, and I
don't see why they should be prevented from doing that.

When you talk about the game being biased in favor of groups, I would have
to reply: Yes, and it should be. We can always discuss how biased, but for
the whole concept of grouping to make sense, doing so must be rewarded. You
seem to regard this reward as an unjust treatment of the solo player.

I recognize that description, which is why I usually only group during
weekends.

As I said, I know how you feel, and I hope the latest XP-boost for soloers
and small groups, as well as the promised upcoming solo content, will make
you a little happier with EQ2. Just don't give up looking for groups,
because that will always be the key to the truly great adventures,
fortunately :-)
