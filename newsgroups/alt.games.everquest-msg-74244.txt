  Just to teleport there, there is very little danger.  I don't think
anything aggressive wanders near the wizard spires or druid ring.
However, if you want to teleport to the Dreadlands as a quick way to
Kunark, hm.  It's going to be dangerous, even with SoW, invisibility
and levitation until the high 30's/low 40's.  In order to get to the
other zone entrances, you have to run through a tunnel which is
sometimes inhabited by creatures which can see invisible.

  With some luck, you can of course survive the run without getting
aggro'd on, but to be prudent, I'd use the boat to get to Kunark until
level 35+ at least.
