If epics were tradeable, how much would you sell yours for, taking
into account the ammount of blood sweat and plat you put into getting
it? Alternatively, if you are one of the richer players out there, how
much would you pay for it?

Purely a hypothetical question of course, but as I can't make any
progress on mine at the moment I thought it would be an interesting
poser.
