It's not a matter of a couple of hours every few weeks.
My bf and I would like to play more often but between patches and server
downtimes it makes it hard.
I guess there are many of you who've been playing alot longer, but I thought
the whole idea for betas/test servers were to try the programs out before
they go live.
We went linkdead three times over the weekend - twice when zoning (one death
out of that) and the other was within the zone.
Maybe it's just me, but I can't remember that many problems when I first
started playing.
