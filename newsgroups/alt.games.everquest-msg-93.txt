Assuming you are a rogue (it may work for other classes) all you have to do
is set up hotkeys for hide and sneak (also sense heading) and roll them
continuously, as fast as you like, when you are not actively engaged in
combat (sense heading you can do while in combat), for example while you are
waiting to heal. You don't even have to wait for them to refresh (although
skill won't improve until they do), it may only save a fraction of a second
but those fractions will build up.

As far as swimming is concerned just take time out to do it. For exampe, if
I am travelling to Oasis from Freeport I'll swim there from the fishing
village in North Ro to the zone, even through the zone to the dock or p1/p2
in Oasis.
