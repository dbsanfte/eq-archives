Thank the gods for your reply.  I've been playing with very few issues
since SoL release including way too many hours last week when I was
burning up vacation time.  After reading Sangs post I thought I would
have to stop since obviously the game is unplayable if he says so.  I
almost deleted both my new kitty warrior and my troll BL since they were
created and leveled up during this period when the game was unplayable
so really can't exist.  Why if I hadn't seen your post I might have
almost begun to doubt that any of this really happened cause I know if
Sang says so it is so.
