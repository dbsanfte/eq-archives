   Oh god, please tell me that posts made to a.g.e. through the portal don't
boost your guys post count.  Having post counts is in my mind one of the worse
features of community forums.  On the FV there were so many Postcount whores
that the mods took the counts away altogether.  I really, really hope that we
don't start seeing posts that go like "Hmmm... you're a dick.  +1".  You
indicate that you think that posting here doesn't add the postcount.  

   EM mods, if that is the case, please stress to your people that postcounts
don't apply here.  This is a stressful time for both sides, and having to deal
with the single most annoying feature of community forums is only going to make
it worse.
