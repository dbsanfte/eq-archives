>Please tell me you didn't do 35 levels in the same dungeon ((( Sigh....

My ranger was born and raised in Surefall and Qeynos Hills.  She did
blackburrow and LOIO and Oasis, the spires and Splitpaw in SK, the RyGorr Fort
in EW and the giants in GD.  We even did the spiders in FV which are still SO
cool.  Oh and the town in Gunthak and Dulak, and now Nadox with a chanter
friend.  Actually she's been most everywhere as she scouts out new zones for
her sisters.
My druid was born in Kelethin and did Crushbone, Mistmoore, EK killing crag
spiders, spent some miserable days in Befallen and the Warrens before finding
her way to EW.  She kites the spectres in Oasis now that no one is there, and
had a ball in the Overthere.  
My shaman was raised in everfrost and can run through a snowstorm without
getting lost.  And that was before the map function :)))
LDON came out just as my cleric turned 20 and she fell in love with the
missions.  So yeah, she's spent most of her years playing there.  She'd STILL
be playing there if she could drag her friends out of POP, where they've been
lured by fast experience.... sigh.... but I *do* enjoy some of those areas so I
just go along with the flow, switching back to Skila when things get dull.  
Some zones I've just never gotten a thrill out of?  Stonebrunt.  Burning Woods.
 Frontier Mountains.  Lavastorm including Sol.  Kaesora.  Dunno why.
