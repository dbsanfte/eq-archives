  (as opposed to merely dead on discord, something thats happened 20 
times or more)

I finally got a character up to level 6; of all things, a warrior.  He 
was twinked out with cloth gloves and 7pp in pearls, dropped in an oven 
by my previous character, a wizard who died at level 5.

Turns out warriors are less fragile than most of my characters.. .or 
more likely its just that the crowd level was low enough that I was able 
to hunt right by the newbie lift quite happily, and that gradually 
gearing myself up into a nearly full set of patchwork helped a lot; all 
characters are pretty much melee at this level, but there's little 
chance of getting better than cloth for pure casters.

Anyway, on hitting level 6, I looked around till I found someone else 
level 6; before this point all characters conned green and were could 
not be attacked, and still all level 5 and under characters conned green 
and were immune.  I was at 50% hp from fighting, so I didn't try taking 
on the level 6 wizard, moved off and sat for a bit.

Once I got back up to full HP, I started moving again, spotted a 
hatchling so I veared off to kill it... then I was suddenly snared. 
Killed the hatchling (didn't want the distraction, and it died in 
another blow or two) by which point I had a skellie pet on me.   Dancing 
around it while I fought it, I spotted a gnome in the distance, sitting 
and waiting.  Got dotted.  Going down fairly rapidly, and I'd only 
dented the pet, brought it to 93% while I got to 50%.   Tried to run 
towards the caster, snared of course this didn't go so well, he could 
easily outpace me and his pet could stay on me the whole time.  Tried to 
run, to see if perhaps jumping or strafe running would be fast enough to 
outpace the pet (doubtful, but worth trying), no joy there either. 
Died, getting a loc of course.

Checking who for the zone afterwards, I discovered my opponent was a 
level 18 SK; why he acted like a necro I don't know, surely he wasn't 
worried about a level 6 warrior.  Turns out that on Discord there's a 20 
level window, I could have been killed by anyone up to level 26!

Getting back to my body, it had been half looted; all the patchwork was 
gone, but some of the gear was still there, including one of the bags; I 
think the "issued" one... which must be no drop.  So, first thing to do 
would be to die 8 times so you have 8 no drop bags, and if you get 
attacked by someone you can't handle, take off your gear and bag it 
quick!  Also, convert cash to gems or something so its in bags.

Funniest thing was, though, that my Short Sword (4/24), the most 
expensive item I had, was still there.  I imagine he didn't realize it 
wasn't a Short Sword* (4/29 no drop, issued on spawning).

Also, it seems that PK points -are- based on the level of the victim, so 
he'd have gotten more points from killing someone level 18 than he did 
me at 6... but since he had no chance of dying killing me, I'm sure he's 
better off farming 6s than trying for the hard stuff.

Trouble, level 1 woodie warrior, Discord
