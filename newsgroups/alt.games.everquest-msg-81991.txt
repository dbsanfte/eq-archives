Dear Michael Fitch:

The person you're calling insane is a medical doctor. He has a different
view than you do and his is based on education, by contrast. His is
biologically accurate and yours is wishful thinking and a bit of
anthropomorphizing. It's wishful and rather hysterical, might I note.

A fetus is the precursor to a live person. It isn't one yet.

And you've entirely missed the point of Billo's post. Your logic is
astonishingly bad. Nearly as bad as your understanding of biology.

This statement of yours is simply absurd: 
> if a fetus isn't a
> human being and just some cell as you so ignorantly stated,then why
> would you abort it, just let the cell mature and see what comes out.

A fetus isn't *yet* a viable human being. It's the "unripe" stage of
one. It's no more a person than a flower is an apple. Obviously, if
permitted to finish the embryonic process, it would be a person. But you
ignore the issues of time and development.

You're also not very good at name calling. Practice that in front of a
mirror and see how it makes your veins stand out in your neck and your
face all red.
