Lets say they are all worth 20 ( a few are actually worth more, but I 
think many less), and that on average 60 drop to every loop.  Split 60 5 
ways, thats 12 each, or 240pp each...and meanwhile Joe Looplooter gets 
300.  Course he might not get lucky, or he might get lucky sooner.  It 
might not be a terrible bargain, but it does tend to favor the guy who 
wanted the loop more than you might think.  Back when the loop was 
seriously sought for, even better, for while you might find one for 300 
now tis probably only -worth- about 100, if not for the fact that 
vendors will buy it at 300.  Since the weapons never were anything but 
vendor fodder, the higher the price of a ring, the better the deal for 
the guy who took it.

Splendid
