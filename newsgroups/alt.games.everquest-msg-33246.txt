Well, if I am understanding you correctly, and you didn't leave out any
steps, you're doing the quest wrong. 

You have to take the lion meat shipment to Halas, turn it in to (I
believe) Teria O'Donas, who will then give you the Lion Delight. You
take the Lion Delight to Iceberg and get the sweaty shirt, which you
then take back to the dog in the Barb. Village in WK, who will lead you
to the person you have to kill. By the way, they are not axes. The
Langseaxe is a 1hs sword, and the Langseaxe of the Wolves is a 2hs
sword.
