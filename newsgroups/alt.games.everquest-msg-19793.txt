You know, I'd like to know how some of these jerks manage to get into
reputable guilds in the first place, guilds that don't drive-by invite
every player they see.  

There is this one guy on the server where I play my Iksar shaman that
is a complete jerk; he insults other players, he has a reputation as
being a big KSer and he does really stupid crap like pull big trains
of skellies on people.  He is probably the one player I can think of
who, if he got jumped by a mob, I would sit and watch die without
helping, and I'm sure a number of other people feel the same way--I
have seen a few times when this guy announces that he's dinged to a
new level, and not one person will respond with a "Grats!"!  Yet this
guy managed to get into one (I think) quite reputable guild.  Then one
day I saw that he didn't have that guild tag on any more (don't know
if he left voluntarily or got kicked out).  But then the next day, he
has the tag for a different guild!  Of course, I, who generally will
try to be helpful and polite to other people, have only got invited to
one guild, which was a guild that was in the process of being created
and they wanted to get the minimum number of players.

(not that I really care if I'm invited into a guild or not; however,
my iksar necro on another server DID get invited into a guild a few
days ago which I DID join).

But I just wonder, I'm guessing that these people must like schmooze a
lot and act all goody two-shoes and suck up to other players in these
guilds so they'll get invited, but I still wonder how they manage to
hide their rotten reputations enough that the guild will invite them
in the first place!  Has anyone else seen anything like this happen?

(it is just frustrating, that's all, and it likely is part of the
reason I haven't played my shaman for a while)
