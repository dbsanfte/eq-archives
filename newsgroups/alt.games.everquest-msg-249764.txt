In the same manner you're using the terms, there isn't any single class that
is strictly speaking, required, at a raid.

They all bring something useful.  Druids are actually one of the harder to
replace, since thier abilities are unique.   Damage from a rogue is
completely interchangable with ranger, mage or wizard damage.  You were
obviously joking in the first message...  don't continue to play it off as
if you were serious, since you were more right before.
