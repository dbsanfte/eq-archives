I'm sure you must have a few items on your character that you are really
really proud of.  Maybe it was a long quest, something a friend gave you,
or whatever...but they probably have stories behind them.  And after
reading Monual's story of his breastplate I realized I like reading these
stories. So...what shinies of yours are you most proud and attached to?

I'll start, because it's no fun if I can't answer my own question,
heh. But I'll spare you the long stories, because I know you've heard
about these already:

1) GSot4W, aka "Sally", my precious staff
2) Dark Master's Greaves, the items that made me realize what wonderful
guildies I had
3) spirit wracked cords - nuff said, if you know the quest
