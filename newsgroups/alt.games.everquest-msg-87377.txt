Don't know, maybe I just don't click fast enough.

Pottery I would definitely say was the easiest, I too was only surprised
when I don't get a skillup, although it seems to have slowed down over 100.

Baking was easy, but boring as hell, it took a lot of combines.

Brewing was similar to baking, but I think went up faster.

Alchemy is slowish, but I only do a few points at a time, I really need to
max it out.

Smithing was painful at times, I did see long streaks of no skillups, but
never saw any real streaks of getting skillups in it.

Tailoring is still low, and I have worked on it very sporadically, so I
can't say anything about a pattern there.

Fletching I have done very sporadically as well, so again, can't say
anything about a pattern there.

Smithing - 175
Brewing - 135
Baking - 135
Pottery - 125
Alchemy - 108
Tailoring - 50ish

Fletching on my ranger at 60ish.
