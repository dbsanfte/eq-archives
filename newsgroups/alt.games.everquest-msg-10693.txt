I tried to share a dynamic link with my SO and could never get it to work.
So i called my telco/dsl provider Swbell and went with the enhanced package
for $20.00 more a month, I now have 5 static ips with a cayman router and
both SO and me are happily cruising. She on the net and me with my
Evercrack.
I pay 59.00 for my dsl with this package as opposed to the original 40.00
with 1 dynamic unshareable ip.

Hope this helps some.
