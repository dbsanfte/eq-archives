Annie supporting a hater like Reg was also fairly chortleworthy. The
two could not be much different.

Had Annie actually seen the first Act of the play, she would not have
responded like she did. Julie may have read Annie wrong, but otherwise
she was the one in the right in this case.

I think Bob was the sort of person who liked seeing what happened when
you mixed two fishtanks together - which fishtank's fish eat the
other. This post was crossposted to comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, sort of
the melting pot newsgroup for PC gaming (rpg variety) where opinions
on games differ far more than they do in a dedicated group like age.
Bob's history with Reg and Julie's presense are from that newsgroup,
along with the majority of the posts.
