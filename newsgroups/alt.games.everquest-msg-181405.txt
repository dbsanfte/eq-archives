If they don't want them kilt, then they had best make sure they don't aggro
when the trolls raid Gukta.  I'm a froglok supporter (amiable in Upper Guk,
never killed a single live froggy), but I've got to say, Go Trolls!

What is this, the second city they have stolen from the trolls?  Hmm, maybe
it's the trolls that are french?
