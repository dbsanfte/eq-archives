Why is that bad?

As far as I can see, there are a few alternatives to static loot:

No loot. This is the approach taken by AO, nothing in that game is 
in any way worth having. If for some reason you prefer that, play AO (or
just play EQ and never loot anything you kill).

Random loot. This is done in many EQ zones, such as Chardok and CoM. The
problem with this is that you have just as much chance of getting the
item at the zone line as you do deeper in, so noone ever learns how to
fight deeper in. Most zones can only support one or two groups at the
zone-in, which isn't a viable population for a pickup group zone. So the
dungeon ends up unused.

Quest loot. A lot of the best equipment in velious is quested, like the
Eyepatch of Plunder. In practise, however, once the quest is solved, it
becomes just a matter of multiple camps, which is not obviously better
than a single camp.

Which of these would you prefer? And why? Or do you have some other
idea?
