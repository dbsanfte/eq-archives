At low levels you don't need to group.  I still solo my warrior at level 
30.  He has no haste item, he is wearing a mixture of crafted and banded 
armor.  The trick is learning where to go and what mobs to hit, and carry 
lots of bandages.  I won't say it's not painful, it is, but it is doable.  
For those that really want to solo, there are several excellent classes 
to choose from that solo quite well.  Necro, Druid, Wizard, Shaman, 
Ranger, Shadowknight, Beastlord, Enchanter, Mage.  (Listed in no 
particular order).  People manage to solo with other classes as well.  
It's all about learning the strengths of your class, and what zones and 
mobs are doable for you.
