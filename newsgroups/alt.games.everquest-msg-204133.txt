> Where are the resists in your calculations?

The resists in my calculations are zero which is exactly what they should be
. Wizards have 3 diffrent spell lines magic , fire , and ice . It is a very
rare mob that resists all 3 . I also did not include all normal buffs for
instance a bard at 24 mana regen or pot9 . I did include a horse so that I
could ignore the need to sit. I did not include the full extent of wizard
criticals using a base 10% which allows for a 5% resist btw. I did not
include clicky dammage items or clicky mana regen items.

If groups I am in can manage 80% time spent fighting I am very happy . 60%
is normal . 25% is all too common.

Shamans are high Dps but only in very controlled circumstances for exact
length fights, though part of their value is certainly in utility. Necros
are ridiculously high dps though it does require a pet. Chanter cod pets are
the main tanks for many high end encounters though we try and keep this a
secret so as not to further antagonize the warriors.
