Don't be silly, if it played you as an NPC caster, you'd have twice as
many hp, three times the AC, and you'd hit for 20 times as much in
melee as you do now, plus you'd have practically unlimited mana and
almost never get interrupted from normal combat injuries... if the game
did that, standard tactic would be for casters and healers to begin
fights and then /q and log back in in three minutes to loot the bodies!
