I can testify that my computer, with only 128mb runs XP 'zippily'.  I'd say
it faster than 2K was.  (Granted it is a 1.5ghz).

I have several computers at work with XP and 128mb that no one complains
about.  It might just be that these systems are pretty good systems
otherwise, so minor paging doesn't affect as much as it does on others.

(I do plan to upgrade, specifically because of Everquest. Prior to running
that I've been able to do 'whatever I want' without excessive slowdown, so I
never upgraded.)
