Yes, I have. I agree with you... it already
happens. Thats why I said its not going to affect
the quality, or at least, my perceived quality of
game.

Whether you buy the character or not, there will
always be incompetent people around.

It might be a good question to ask higher levels.

How often has a player wiped out your group
because of incompetence?

Does it happen more with bought characters or not?


What if the amount of time you had played could be
displayed to another player?

"Hmmm... you are a lvl 60, yet your timer shows
only 10 mins played... I don't think you are made
of the right stuff."

Would this fix the problem?

I'm sure it would be, but it is hardly an excuse
to allow your group to be wiped out!

This doesn't seem to be an argument against
pre-made characters, as much as an argument to
allow incompetent characters into your group!

Get rid of them, or get out of the group, is the
way I see it.

This is how Martin said he and his guild deal with
incompetent lvl 60's. (My brackets);

"If they were..(incompetent) well they would be
asked to leave and TL'd out.. non-guild people who
wont leave your area (faction leaches) and train
shit like AoW/Idol on you.. well not much you can
do, petition and shitlist them."

I don't know if I would. It might be preferable to
dying.

It was my understanding that players at these
levels DO make efforts to check others out. I
could be wrong about this, though.

You may have hit the nail on the head there.
Perhaps if they were to sell premade characters,
they might hope to become "all things to all
people", and get all sorts of dollars from all
people.
