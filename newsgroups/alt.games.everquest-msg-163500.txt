It is coincidence.  Try getting an Agility buff after you are encumbered,
see if you move any faster.  Hint, you won't.  Agility and Movement Speed
are both affected by encumberance directly.  AC is affected indirectly by
your Agility being reduced.  The reason there are people who think Agility
affects movement speed is precisely the one you stated, that when
encumbered, both are reduced.  I would recommend as a second test, get a
shaman to make one of the stat potions that debuffs Agility, and see if that
affects your movement speed.  Greater Stability would be an excellent choice
for that test, it reduces your Agility by 20, while increasing Stamina and
Strength.

An example of your reasoning could be, smoking causes coughing and lung
cancer, therefor, coughing raises your chance of getting lung cancer.
