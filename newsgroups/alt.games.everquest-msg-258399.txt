So convince your guild of that.   Maybe you can talk them into making an
exception for just you.     But I know I sure wouldn't want to take on the
position of evaluating every pet owner for competency, in addition to all
the other things a raid leader has to worry about.   I'd rather just make
the one rule that is the correct one in the most situations and enforce it.
With any exceptions going the other way.

See, that wouldn't fly with us either.  If you can't control your pet, you
won't be allowed to have one out no matter what AA's you have on your
character.  That person would probably still be welcomed, but he would be
speificly instructed not to summon his pet, until he proved he was able to
control it.  Refusal to do so would most likely result in an ass chewing
followed by a TL out.
