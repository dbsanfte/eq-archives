You know... while the FAQ makes a strong position for bottom posting (one 
which I've always agreed with from my first day using e-mail and 
USENET)... it DOES still come down to personal preferance of how you like 
to see things ordered, and past conversations recorded.

I don't know why anyone prefers top posting... but some do.  Still, the 
point is, top posting is not "incorrect" and reordering it in a response 
is not "correcting" it as some would like to imply.
