I agree that if there is any blame to be handed out about this, it
needs to be closer to home.  But, it's only been, what, 4 or 5 months
since this kid topped himself?  I don't think that it's possible for
this woman to blame herself right now.  That kind of pain, a parent
losing a child, is huge.  Sure, the mom probably did crap to make this
kids problems worse, but to keep her sanity her mind has to distance
her from her son's actions.  Then along comes this group of douche
bags telling her that it's not her son's fault he killed himself, it's
not HER fault he killed himself, it's this GAMES fault.  It MADE this
perfectly good boy hurt himself.  She's gonna be so fucked in the head
just from the sheer pain she's feeling that she is going to latch onto
this like a lifeline.

Really, it's shit like this that makes me hate people (as a group, not
as a collection of individuals).
