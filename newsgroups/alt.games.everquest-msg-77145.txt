Tonight after installing a Geforce 2 with the latest drivers I took the boat
from FV to BB.  All was well until I got on it at which time most of the
boat turned invisible and I appeared to be standing on water.  When we
reached elf  island I appeared to be inside of the boat, previously I had
been standing on the bottom of the ramp, and so I tried to move back to the
ramp at which point I fell in and had to swim to the island.  Later after
logging and coming back I tried the boat again and had the same problem and
so returned to the island, rather than risk falling in when I tried to use
the BB shuttles blind.

Has anyone else encountered this problem or found a solution to it, for as
of now the boat is all but useless to me and since I play largely melee type
characters and non-porters this poses a serious problem.
