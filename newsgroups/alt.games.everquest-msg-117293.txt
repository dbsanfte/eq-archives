   I get the sense that the GM's and guilds would like it if _everyone_ played a
paladin, or preferably, a cleric.  "You need a rez due to a game bug?  Very well. 
Cast away!"  And I'm sure playing in a group of all clerics/pallys would be...
interesting.  Maybe doable?  Of course, the server could say good-bye to hate and
fear raids....
