It is irritating, isn't it? I hate it when some schmuck comes up to me and
invites me into a group without asking, or even talking to me... and I
usually tell him what I think. As for inspecting... I have done this by
accident before, but I usually apologise. Or I ask first. But I don't think
it's a huge big deal to be targeted or inspected... I just think it
courteous if someone ask to inspect me first. <shrug>...
