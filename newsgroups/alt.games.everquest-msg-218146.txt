No its a major point in genetic counselling IIRC.

Actually you do not. Basic biology there are random elements of
recombination events that can occur during generation. This is one of the
mechanisms of genetic variance. A dominant disease causing gene should
make you think very carefully but the precise answer is pretty variable
based on a LOT of context. THese mutations arise somewhere as well. It
looks rather like Queen Victoria is the source of a whole load of
Haemophilia in families in Europe

Is this a case of a known, defined gene mutation in the family or just a
case of a lot of cases? A lot of people say they have Alzheimer's in the
family but its is just pretty common (only 5-10% can be put to genetics
there). 'Predisposition' in genetic terms is a real nightmare to define
since it suggests merely a risk variable, like say Apolipoprotein in
Alzheimer's, which works VERY differently to say the gene involved in
Huntingtons.

Yes but that aint genetics. Most countries have laws to try and eliminate
this (whether you like such ideas or not), so in fact their is a solution
and it is a choice made after the choice to bring the kid into the world.
