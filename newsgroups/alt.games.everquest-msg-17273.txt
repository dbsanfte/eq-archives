I too would like to know the answer to this. The head is part of the
monk's red headband quest, yes?  I put my monk on the back burner to
work on my warrior before I finished that quest. I have two of the
heads, but had not obtained the one off of Rex somethingorother. (The
one that spawns in the northwest corner of the zone, or used to
anyway.)  Spent the last couple levels in Paw and SK, and continuously
heard shouts of people looking in vain for the quest gnolls. Nobody has
seen them for quite some time, apparently.  Has Verant made any sort of
official statment about them being removed in the last patch or two?
