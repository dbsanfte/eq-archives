Well, seem to recall a game called Anarchy Online, anyone remember that 
one? Lots of people said the same you say now, but i dont exactly see EQ 
going under for that one. (personally had a great laugh when they 
reopened a friends account 3 months after he stopped playing it, and 
gave him another free month, so he could "reexperience" AO).

And since your rant is WAY outdated (saw a lot of people like you when 
DaoC came out), i doubt your rant here will make any important 
difference for anyone, apart your ego.

But hey, you dont like EQ, ill be happy to see you go, dont come back.
