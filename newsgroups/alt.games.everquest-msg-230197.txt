If you decided to go dwarf hunting and completely trash your faction (while
at the same time, greatly increasing your number of hunting zones) and
bottom out your Coldain faction, will the merchants there attack you on
sight if they are bright green to you?

I ask this because I'm thinking of switching to giant faction so I can
complete a quest, but I'd still like to use my Thurgadin gate potion.  As a
ranger, I can either hit innate camo the moment I land in Thurgadin, and if
I can, could I then stand behind the girl that hands out the velium vapor
extractor and use sneak to get another one?  If that's the case, then I can
really have my cake and eat it too.
