I would like to know what see thinks she is responding to. There is no
way she could post to this without seeing the topic. If it didn't bother
her, if she really wasn't affected by any of this, she wouldn't have
felt the need to post to it. Posting around the topics is the same
thing, then you wonder why the EQng is prime for this sort of thing. If
I was to summarize the disposition of some of the people here I would
have to include some psychological evaluation including
contraindications. It would seem that a certain group has tried to
create a world for themselves that offers some protective qualities as
opposed to the hardship they feel in the real world. In other words a
nerd world where nerds are the norm. This has seemingly come crashing
down as the safe haven is disappearing. They hold on to hope that it is
a temporary condition although it's not. This place will never be the
same.
