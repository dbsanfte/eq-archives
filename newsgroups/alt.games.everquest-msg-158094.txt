Droods/Wiznerds didn't "offer a service" they sold it. Risk vs Reward
didn't even exist, and the majority of other players have little or no
respect for them. They have been the "whores" of EQ for 3+ years. Pay
them for a quicky (eq a port to where you want to go), and then ignore
them and move on. 

The power of the two classes has not been diminished (Quad-Kiting,
Evac, etc), and asking for something to replace the monopoly they held
on fast travel is asinine. Welcome to Norrath, now go out and earn
your plat like everyone else (kill/loot/sell)

People that actually play Druids and Wizards, don't see this as a
nerf. It is a relief from all of the port beggars, and hopefully in
how their classes are viewed.. The real slap in the face is all of the
"port-bots" sitting on second/guild accounts that have ruined the
reputation of those that have invested themselves personally into the
two classes.
