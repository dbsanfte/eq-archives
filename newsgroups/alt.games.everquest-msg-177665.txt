It didn't bother me too much when they broke mez, at least not as much as 
it probably should have.  Last night I TRIED to get my pet Golem or 
Elemental or Fiend to break mez and the bastard wouldn't while EXPing in 
The Hole.

I won't be doing many pick-up groups with my Chanter anymore, but if I do, 
it will be interesting to see with the new message.  I'm sure we'll have 
some good laughs at some point.  druid_01 DoTs a mob, chanter mezzes mob, 
and druid_01 immediately dies, then the DoT ticks...  Or, drops a DoT and 
zones after the Mez.  I wonder how it's going to attribute the breaking in 
those situations.  Can't wait to see "Fredsdruid's Corpse has woken A 
Pissed-off Golem from it's sleep," etc.
