Mother nature is just the dealer at the craps table. It's the parents choice
to roll the dice and their responsibility for the result - discounted
extreme envirmental factors like a basement full of radeon or a kick in the
guts.

Yeah - and people win the lottery too. The gentics of the parents and the
enviroment they provide for their kids are the single biggest determining
factors in the production of offspring. Parents have to take responsibility
for what they bring into this world.

Yes - but once they decide to roll those craps the responsibility of the
outcome is purely in there hands. If you are not ready to accept
responsibility for the throw then don't step up to the table.

Yes, only the parents have the choice but with thet choice comes
RESPONSIBILITY for the result. The day you, me or SOE are to be held
responsible for how some kid turn out is the same day they should have a say
on whether the dice were thrown in the first place. Nonsense? Yes of
course - thats the whole point.

Not just genes, enviroment as well. The parents (in most cases) are the
single biggest enviromental factor as well in determining the outcome of the
offspring. So the parents then trying to blame anyone or anyhting else for
their offsprings inbalance and subsequent demise is just ridiculous.
