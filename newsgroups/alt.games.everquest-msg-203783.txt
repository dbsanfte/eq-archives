These have what I would describe as a "medium" range dispel, and it's
a 4-slot dispel too. They have moderate hps for the zone and don't hit
as hard as, say, the Wyverns. Valid techniques for killing them
include root/rot, bard chanting, pet attack, plus just having a tank
thump them with a healer nearby.

There are so many of them because folks would generally prefer to kill
almost anything else before the chromodracs, so eventually the zone
fills up with them.

If you have a full group with perhaps a couple of Pet classes (even
54+ clerics remember) then you can safely clear them out - a
mage/shaman/necro pet tears them up nicely while you dot from a
distance (or even just let the pets do ALL the work - a good cleric
knows how effective a buffed pet can be, but remember the chromo will
dispel pet buffs too).
