No, the jackass who can't even follow a simple rule that doesn't harm
him or anyone else in any way to follow should be ashamed of himself
and deguilded pronto. There is NO excuse not to abide by the naming
policy, ESPECIALLY with how lax it is now days. The only reason not to
follow it is some childish rebellious streak that makes one feel
compelled to thumb their nose at "the man" by ignoring a simple
guideline.

And before you break out the classic "so none of you ever speed"
comeback, I'll answer for you: No, not intentionally. And if I get
caught speeding, I'm not going to blame anyone but myself.
