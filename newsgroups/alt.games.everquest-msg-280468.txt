Is this experience table still a fact ?
Class balancing is good but how the f**k can a half elf ranger have 20% more 
experience penalty than a human necro,  halfling druid or dwarf cleric.
The necro or druid would level a lot faster even without that penalty 
because of being able to solo all the time he couldn't find a group.
The cleric would have a much easier time finding a group and also do better 
even without the experience penalty.
If they already looked into class balance this should also be adjusted.
