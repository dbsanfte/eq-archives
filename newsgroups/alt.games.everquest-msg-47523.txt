I'd just be happy if they fixed the 2 year old "grouping bug" where
if somebody camps or zones or who knows why it happens suddenly nobody
can invite you into a group or visa-versa until you all camp and come
back. Also, if the group leader camps or goes LD or whatever, another
person in the group should automatically become "yellow" as in leader
and able to invite or disband people.
 
 That "grouping bug" is the oldest and bigest pain in the ass in the 
game as far as I'm concerned. I mean, come on, fix it already for Pete's
sake.
