I recently started playing my 52 warrior again after a long break and
i noticed his taunt was really bad even with his 2 lammys and haste,
has taunt been nerfed? or are his weapons just too slow to be any
good? other melee's in the group did not have uber weapons , and his
taunt is skill is maxed, a 48 ranger and a 49 shadow knight were
taking some real heavy damage and there was not a lot i could do about
it.
