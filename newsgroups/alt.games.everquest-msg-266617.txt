That's not what I said at all. I said I couldn't think of better 'real 
world' examples of -other definitions of human beings that have been 
used'.

That means other than the current definition, which I agree with more or 
less, the only other examples of a -different- definition I'd thought of 
were the cases of Jews and Blacks being excluded.

I'm ok with excluding sex, race, religion. But I'm worried about the 
'and so on'... after all: the current definition is based on -age-.

The OP asserted that fetuses are human beings. Under that premise  
terminating them would be illegal, and would be murder. (And abortion 
would be unconstitutional)

So a corpse isn't human? Nor a baby?

No. I'm prepared to accept a zygote as a member of the species human 
being. I'm also prepared to accept a corpse as a member of the species 
human being. I am prepared to accept that the legal rights and 
protections afforded human beings need not start start at the instent of 
fertilization though.

And should be used as a litmus test of any definition you propose.

So if I'm exposed to a little radiation I'm excluded from the species? 
Yikes! (Of course your not saying that... but it is a consequence of 
that definition)

Of course.

Consider what would happen if the supreme court decided that everything 
from a zygote onward was a human being, with all the legal rights and 
protections that entails.

**Without changing the definition of murder, killing fetuses becomes 
murder.**

The original poster is arguing that the fetuses are human beings. By 
extension, and -without redefinition of murder- terminating them -is- 
murder.

The OP is not redefining words all over the place. He simply -beleives- 
fetuses -are- human beings. (not '-should be-' but really '-are-') If 
you are working from a framework where fetuses -are- human beings then 
terminating them -is- murder. (without redefining murder.)

I think the problem here, is simply that you beleive the OP is arguing 
that fetuses -should- be human beings. That isn't the case, the OP is 
already convinced that they -are-. (And there is nothing wrong with 
thinking that.)

<snip> forgive the giant snip but I figured the rest of the discussion 
was becoming largely tangential, and starting to ramble.
