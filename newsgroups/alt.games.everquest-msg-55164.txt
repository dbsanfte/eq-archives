Well it is not just DAoC. There are others on the horizon and Verant is
losing clients. Not many right now but there will be more. They have done
lots of other things to help players level easier and will continue to do
so. I doubt they will ever make cross class abilities available to low
levels but there is gear being brought into the game that allows melees to
cast making them a hybrid without the penalties. Etc. Boats have never been
a problem because there is always the fire pots or a druid willing to make a
few plat. Heh I know I am one. =)
Getting totally rid of the boats and making teleports as simple as going to
a NPC in the zone would ruin those port classes.

If they are trying to, as you say keep the long time players that are burnt
out then trying to implement the trivial loot is a prime example or what not
to do. The main reasons players get burnt out is because of the things wrong
with the game now. Little things that bother them. Not one thing in
particular but lots of little things that all add up to a big thing. Making
it easier and not tougher to get gear is never the answer. They are doing
that because in one of the most recent patches they lowered the resistance
on some Uber MoBs and completely revamped Chardok to give the high levels
and easier place to get gear and XP.

They totally screwed up Stoneburnt though with the way they setup that zone.
They said they wanted to make a LOIO for that area and failed miserably.
What they made is another "old" Chardok for lower levels that will get
changed I am sure.
