I would say that scenario falls in to the category of things they just 
don't divulge (whether that particular GM had the knowledge or not), 
leaving it up to player discovery as per established protocol. A "go ask 
another player" type of response would be consistent with that, though I 
agree that they should have stated as much if that were the case.
