Somewhat related to spells wearing off and aggro, I've noticed
that when I cast a DOT on a mob, the mob usually doesn't react
right away.  I'm guessing the damage is applied only on the tick,
so the spell effect is delayed to start on a tick, and that's why
spells wear off on the tick.  (And why all the timers on in the
buffs window are always multiples of six seconds apart.)
