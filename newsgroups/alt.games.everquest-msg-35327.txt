At your present level (45) if most of your friends are around that level I'd
recomment a minimum of 3 groups, half of whom are tanks, and including
plenty of healing power (either lots of druids/shaman or a couple clerics).
You can probably get by with 2 tank-heavy groups if you know the zone and
what to do when you get to the BRs.

At mid-50s if you've done the BRs before (or a raid leader has) you can get
by with one group but you'd better make sure at least 3 of them are real
tanks (shaman and clerics aren't in ANY way, shape or form tanks :) ) and at
least one cleric.

The BRs multi-spawn...when you kill one another may (and probably will, a
couple times) immediately spawn on the last one's corpse.  Average is 3
spawns + a ghostly guy (read about this before you go) but I'VE seen as many
as 7 (and heard of more than a dozen).  I think ANY of them have a chance of
dropping a reaver, but the best I've seen is 2 reavers after 3 base BRs.  By
that I mean, 2 reavers after about 9 or 10 total BRs.
