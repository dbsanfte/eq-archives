Did you see it listed? Episode 1 is ranked 4th of the existing Star
Wars films with me.

If you ever get the chance, watch the Norwegian puppet movie "Fl�klypa
Grand Prix" - the pod race resembles that film even more strongly than
it resembles the race in "Ben Hur", which they're both a ripoff of.
("Fl�klypa" is a pretty good movie, too. Shame it's unlikely to be
found outside Norway)
And speaking of Indiana Jones, I recently saw a TV ad for a boxed set
of the movies, and half of the film clips shown in the ad were from
the YJK series... (Harrison Ford does NOT look like that kid)
