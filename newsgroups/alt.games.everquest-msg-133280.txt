As other people mentioned, Winged Death and BoR stack, however, WD is rarely
resisted (like all of the swarm series) except on high MR (swirlspines in
kedge, Ulump) or melee range only mobs (eg perma ice giants, sol b fire
giants, dragons), BoR is resisted a lot by even marginally FR mobs due to
the ac/fr debuff components adding additional resist checks, plus BoR has a
25% base fizzle rate compared to Winged Death.

I very rarely cast BoR unless it's duoing with another druid, or overloading
something that someone's trying to KS from me.  Most of the time when I'm
root/rotting I just use WD and free Drones of Doom off my thurg bracer.
With FT1 and the FT2 wolf form, I can meditate most of the mana from WD back
by the time it wears off, assuming root isn't being broken a bunch.  I have
Warden Symbol for free root, even if it's only 48 seconds, but I might be
retiring it when I make 56 in favor of Engorging Roots (3 yellow to go,
whee).  Though obviously the FT2 wolf form doesn't work indoors, which is
where I actually like to spend a lot of time, I can't wait to scribe PotC
and get Mask of the Stalker.  I might actually be able to get MotS easier
than a lot of people because I found out one of my friends can get me into
one of the top 3 guilds on my server when I make 60 (it's either number 2 or
3 depending on who you talk to, they've done AoW 3 times and never gotten AL
due to time lock by the other 2/3 guild or the #1 guild, but the other 2/3
has done AL 2 times but failed twice on AoW, once because of a dumbass GM
'accidentally' hitting his dispel hotkey at 20%).  Err... Hi, I ramble a
lot.

Egress is definitely worth getting excited over, it's an escape spell with
the same cast time as gate, it reloads the zone (clears you from agro lists)
and doesn't require changing your bind point.  Obviously it does have
somewhat limited use in a few zones with multiple entrances far from each
other through deadly terrain if you're hunting on the wrong side (Griegs End
and Sirens Grotto in particular).  Egress also costs less mana, and it
allows you to be an integral part of a CoH chain  (you egress to zone in
where new arrival is, invite him to group, mage summons you and new arrival
to raid site), though a Decession-enabled (translocate: egress) wizard can
make CoH chains easy also, but it seems that Decession is a fairly rare
spell that some wizards never manage to get.
