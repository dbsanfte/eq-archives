The PoK lockups have been biting me also. My system isn't bleeding edge
but it's not low end either. 

I have noticed that rapid movement in PoK seems to tickle this bug.
My bard running around with Selos locks up a *lot*. My cleric with
RS3 locks up fairly often. Other alts with no enhanced run speed 
haven't locked up. I've started walking around PoK instead of running 
and haven't locked up on any of them since.  *knock on wood*
