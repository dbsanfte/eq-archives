FWIW, I have pissy days myself :)
My partner is a wizard, (now level 40).  Non-twinked - original character. 
Back when he started porting at 29 we were pretty darn poor.  That 10 plat came
in real handy back then.  Of course CR's were free - I've never seen any druid
or wiz refuse a naked person.
Nowadays we will be in the middle of nowhere (Guk, for example), and he'll get
a /tell for a port or a bind.  If we aren't busy he's always happy to oblige. 
He doesn't have a set rate.  It's polite to pay and nice to SOW in return. 
Remember, he has to get back to where he started from - and wizzies aren't
known for their great armor class.
