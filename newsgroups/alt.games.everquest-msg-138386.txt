Lets see if I can do this by memory

Solstice earring
Pixie Rib earring
Amulet of the Grey Wastes
Enshrouded Veil
(forget the name, SS helm, something of the Arisen)
2 velium jasper rings
Weight of the Gods
Donals' Vambraces
Etherial Mist Chestplate
CC Gauntlets
Silvery Belt of Contention
Sebelite Scale bracer
Bracer of the Reverant
Donals Boots of Mourning
Greaves of Forbidden Rites
Righteousness
Sarnak Battleshield
Seal of Thurgadin
Holy water (I keep this in ammo in case I want to loot my body pre res)
Travellers Boots in open inventory slot
Spyglass in a bag, swaps in inventory if I need an insta clicky

I do have some other gear that I use as resist gear, but this
is my general "fighting kit"

This puts me right at 200 wisdom (base wis 100) so my upgrade
priorities would be to not lose any wisdom, but to raise
my FT, +mana, +hp, AC, and Wisdom, in that order of
importance,  and to get more clicky items... clicky just plain rocks.

I've been haunting Bazaar on and off for a while now, but I see very
little offered that would be an improvement, at least not under 10K
pp.  This comes as a bit of a surprise to me, as I thought I had
some gaping holes caused by being too lazy to haunt EC or
the /auctions channel... I figured I'd be able to get at least
a better earring than pixie rib, better range than Seal of Thurgadin,
better arms and boots than Donals...It does look like for around 15K
I can get brellium boots, just have to save up a bit.

Are there any easy to get no drop (or drop, but rarely sold) items
I should be going out and picking up?  Or bazaar items I'm
somehow overlooking as potential improvements?
