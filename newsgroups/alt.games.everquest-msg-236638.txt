As a 63 BST I've spent some time soloing in Natimbi and seen other
beastlords in the 58-65 range doing the same. The mobs are mostly lb to me,
a few db. Soloing them is no problem but having two on me is a bit
challenging as they do hit fairly hard (nowhere near 1,000+ but plenty of
200s and 300s). The NPCs at the camp do not help, it's up to players there
to kill each others' trains. Some of the mobs cast baby dots that are
trivial, I don't even bother curing them.

It's a good solo setup for a pet class, but I would think that druid/wizard
kiting would be risky -- the mobs are highly social and are constantly
wandering around, the kiter would be at high risk of adds. And they
definitely hit hard enough to kill a druid or wizard in short order once
getting into melee range. Some of them stun as well, which would be fatal to
a druid trying to get a mob re-rooted.

The incentive is a series of turnin quests to the NPCs at the Natimbi camp,
yielding some decent equipment pieces. I've gotten one so far myself.

There is one undead-spawn in some ruins which, given enough time and drops,
can yield a rather nice 1HB weapon. Those mobs do not wander as far as I can
tell. They are currently db to me but its usually camped either by a 60s
soloer or a 50s group.
