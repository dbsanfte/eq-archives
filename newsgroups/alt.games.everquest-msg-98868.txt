Druids are a UTILITY class. Which means that although they aren't the
best at anything they have the ability to do many things at a
reasonable skill level.

It's amazing how much better a raid goes when the unneeded classes
show up. Have you ever seen a raid with just clerics, warriors,
enchanters, wizards and shaman? Of course not, that would be silly.
Every class has a role and brings something to the table to improve a
raid or group situtation. Remember when rogues were concidered
useless? Now they are among the most desired class for a raid. They
are wizards with using mana. As the game changes the skills of a class
become more appreciated.

Loathing your class doesn't help anything but reinforce the erroneous
opinions that X class is useless. Prove them wrong!
