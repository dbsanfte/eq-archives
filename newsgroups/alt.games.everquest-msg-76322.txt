As a monk, you should be very excited about run.. three points of it
would be the first (and probably the last) exciting thing to do, and you
don't need 6 points in this area and 12 in that area in order to do it,
either.

The difference between a monk who can outrun mobs indoors and
one who can't is pretty astounding, having just spent the day in
Chardok helping two monks get their pipes one after another.
