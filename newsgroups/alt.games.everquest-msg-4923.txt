Last night/this morning (4/21), someone I met was having problems with the
North Freeport guards (the Knights of Truth.)

He had previously had an excellent reputation with them.  He attacked one of
the guards just to get killed.  He didn't take any faction hits, he just let
the guard whack him to death.

The rest of the night, he couldn't step foot into North Freeport without
getting attacked.  Is this a bug?  Or are the Knights of Truth a lot more
touchy about being attacked than most other guards?  I've done 'suicide by
guard' before, and it's never made me instant KOS......I wonder why so with
him?

Any comments?
