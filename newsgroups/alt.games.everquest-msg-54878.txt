I dropped him three times last night.  Died once when I tried to take
him with a 20mana cleric, 40mana druid, and a Warrior who got lost
kiting him around while the cleric medded.  We didn't realize he would
respawn almost immediately after dying.  Literally, as in we killed
him, then ran from Ferrott to near Lake Rathe to loot the 13/26 bard
weapon, so I can max my 1hb, then were jumped by the next one.  He's
not that tough if you have any decent resists, never feared me, only
hit me for 500 once, and I hadn't put my resist gear on yet.  The hard
part is that you have to be right under his hips an facing the right
way to hit him, and in melee range to cast on him.  Watched people
blow entire manabars casting from out of range.  (Two of the folks I
watched do this are druids who I know have never been in a dungeon
harder than CoM, and only there because I dragged them.)  He dropped
pally Helm every time, decent warrior weapon, very nice warrior neck,
some pally neck, and sellables.  Only bad thing is that even a 56 rezz
didn't get me back to 58, but dying in WW when Glati gated and
summoned me is partially responsible for that.  I think everyone in my
guild who went there got something good enough to wear at least
situationally, which is pretty damn good considering we're all 55+.
