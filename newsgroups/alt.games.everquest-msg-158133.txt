That's not what it's about.  It's about a class defining ability
being given to anyone willing to pony up $30 for PoP.  It's not
that different from releasing an expansion where any class can
res, cast KEI, backstab, summon corpses, manaburn, summon focus
items, etc.

What truly amazes me is that everyone whined and bled and gnashed
their teeth when pre-10 deaths stopped causing exp loss and you
re-spawned with all gear intact.  However, give every class in the
game teleports, and it's no big deal.  <boggle>

Your debating tactics are interesting.  Don't make a point at all,

There's a difference between expressing yourself honestly and
bluntly and pointlessly taunting someone (unless taunting people
is amusing to you, which as I said, I find childish).

There's no contradiction in the things I said.

Druids aren't JUST about being port whores.  On the other hand,
everyone gained what used to be a class defining ability.  As
others have suggested, I'm sure clerics (and to a lesser degree,
paladins) wouldn't be all that thrilled if the world was filled
with NPCs that could res.

I was honestly very much looking forward to level 29.  I could
be that much more valuable to my guild.  And now...my value to
the guild has gone down considerably.  That makes me unhappy.

Druids DID lose something.

: Then why in hell would you care that port whoring is less profitable?
: Or did you just have an uncontrolable urge to post a stupid analogy?

When did I ever complain that port whoring would now be less
profitable?  What I really care about is that I re-rolled a
druid on FV in part because I could be a huge asset to my
guild by offering free teleports.  Profit was never my motive.

:> What does PoP teleports have to do with groups anyway?

: LOL.  Thank you.  That's the point I've been having a hard time

Actually, now that I give it more thought, the PoP expansion will
make druids even LESS desirable in really high end groups.

: analogy in support of port whoring is just stupid.  And the "grand
: assumption" bullshit above is pretty lame in that context.

: Overall, I give you only a 7.0.  You suffer, as do I, from wordiness.

I just like to show flamers and people who are condescending what
it's like to be on the other end of the discussion.  I've always
had this strange psychological desire to support the underdog.

Right now, Ingot is the underdog.  He's being ripped to shreds
unfairly.  Most people are just joining in to beat up the easy
target.  But he has valid points.  It would be refreshing to see
people acknowledge some of his points.  PoP *has* diluted the
abilities of druids -- one of the very few class defining abilities
of druids.  I think that's all he's really trying to say, and I
honestly haven't found any of his posts whiney, though that does
not stop people from accusing him of being whiney.
