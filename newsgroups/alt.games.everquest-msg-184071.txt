Speculation is that it was an inducement by Sony to buy POP. When LOY
came out, it was nerfed at the same time.

I bought POP mainly for the easy Mana preserve 2 and Healing 2 items
(at the time my highest character was 30 and I didn't really need the
port system).  Guess they will be nerfed soon too.
