Why are people soooo stupid around this zone?
90% of people know to train to the right when zoning in or out to keep a
"safe" area on either side, yet every single time I go there I get trained
by idiots going the wrong way.  Been killed after a narrow escape on the
other side so many times that I've come to loathe this zone - and most of
the people around it...
