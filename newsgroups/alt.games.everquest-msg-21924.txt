Speaking as a long time Wizard, I can say that if a mob *does* aggro
on me, it's something stupid I've done on my part.  Either I've
overnuked, or my timing was off, or I hit the wrong target.  If I get
hit, and die, it's my own fault.  I have my own AC/HP/Resist buffs,
should I need them.  Me asking for buffs is costing my party mana, and
downtime.
