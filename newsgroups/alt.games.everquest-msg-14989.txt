I've had this happen to me several times....
With my Barbarian warrior trying to flee a train in Blackburrow... he got
hit very hard by one of the higher level mobs for a lot of damage just as he
was exiting the zone.  Once doing this while zoining into QH, he spawned
near the crossroads in QHills.  The other time this happened, he was trying
to escape into Everfrost, got hit just before he zoned, and wound up near
the Everfrost newbie ramp.

Another character in Crushbone got hit by Dvinn for a hefty sum of damage on
his way out of the zone, and spawned on the hill above the PoD lift.

I was not unconscious any of these times that I can remember, but I was
pretty close to being dead.
