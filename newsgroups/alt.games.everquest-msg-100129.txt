I almost thought this was an april fools joke until I downloaded
the patch message myself.

Increased costs are one thing but a fucking 30% increase!

Holy shit!! I wish I could go to my customers and just start
charging 30% more. Would be damn nice. They'd fucking
laugh in my face.

With all the competition you would think it should drive the
prices down. Of course that only happens when the market is
saturated, obviously it must not be. There are more people playing
than I thought.

Well they actually lost more potential money from me. I was
thinking of getting a second account, now those plans are nixed.

On top of this they said they just hit over 420,000 subscribers
and now they are going to RAISE the prices?
