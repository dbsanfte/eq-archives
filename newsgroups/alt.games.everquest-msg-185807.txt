After months, nay, years, of soloing around Norrath even a Dark Elf gets
lonely.  I think I'd quite like to join a guild, but I don't know how to go
about it.

What's good form?

Can I approach guild members and ask them directly?  Am I just supposed to
/shout and hope someone answers?  Do I have to be invited?  Have I to group
with them for a while first?  Is there anywhere I can find out about each
guild and what their purposes and principles are?  Would any of them have
any use for a level 13 Dark Elf rogue?

I'm on Seventh Hammer.

I'd appreciate any advice, since I've never really got into the whole
'social interaction' thing before.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
