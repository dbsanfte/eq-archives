this comes into the catagory of sales techniques where they are saying it
can be done, but they really can't be bothered.

They put a high price tag on the service, which will disuade most people
from bothering. But then again, if someone STILL wants the service then they
make such a massive profit that its worth it for them. Lets face it, how
long would it take to extract character information from one database on one
server, and add it to a database on a second (identical) server? 10 minutes?

$300/hour - not bad, if thats just to cover the wages of the staff doing the
work, then I want to work for VI!
