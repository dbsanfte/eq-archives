I've been a reader/lurker on eq-widows for a long time now.

Believe me, I've seen first hand many many times the level of irational and
downright moronic posts there.

Sure theres a problem when you're partner would rather play a video game
than go to bed with you, but hi GET A CLUE!   "A problem"  does not mean its
EQ's fault.

They need to look a little closer to home for the reason and quit trying to
blame Sony, cuz im damned sure more "normal" healthy people play EQ than the
number of deranged addicts who can't bear to look at their partners again,
and Im sure they are outnumbered by 500 to 1

I understand why they are emotional and upset, but when anybody posts and
says.. hang on, reality check here..  you know if EQ didn't exist these
problems would still be here, they get flamed to hell and back.   Treat the
problem not the symptoms
