Did they ask you for the heals or buffs?  You expect a thank you for
standing around making them worry that you might ninja loot something,
something I've seen done several times by people that were "just here for
faction"?  I've seen a lot worse than no thank you.  You could have healed a
sacrificial player which they let die and guess who's next on the mob's
beatdown list, something I've also seen done.
