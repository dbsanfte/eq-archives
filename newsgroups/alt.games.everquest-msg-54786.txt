FM on Kunark. I went from 25 to 30 there. Kill Giants in groups at the
giant fort (always has people), and you can get occasional (very rare)
Forest Loops (I got two there in my levelling) and the giants drop off
4 pp per kill quite often.

Go to OT when you hit 30. 25 is too low for the normal 'ledge' groups. 
Loot is extremely bad in OT, btw, it's a pure exp camp.
