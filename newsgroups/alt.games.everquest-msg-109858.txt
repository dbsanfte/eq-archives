I don't need to witness.  Just do the test for yourself.  Post the
numbers you came up with.  We want to see what agilities you used,
what distance you ran, and what times it took for each character.  No
test of runspeed will be acceptable except actually measuring runspeed
with different agilities.  Since you are claiming that agility will
affect runspeed of an uninjured, unencumbered player you may not
injure or encumber the characters except as a third condition for
comparison.
