    It won't be fixed. People on Sullon Zek used it to make money, and
making money without interacting with PCs or killing/questing is simply
verboten in EQ. It's against "the Vision", you know.

    Then move the Skyiron sheets to the other half of Cabilis. Spread the
components out. Remember, they cannot make Fine Steel Plate and use it
themselves, so the ability to make Cab Scale should be equal to another
race's ability to make FSP.

    This, I love. How much money are tradeskillers MAKING selling to
vendors, anyways? Is it so massive that it throws the EQ economy as out of
whack as hill giants in Rathe Mountains do? You want to stop the flood of
cash in the economy, nerf the hell out of them. Or (and I hate to mention
this, as it WILL draw a nerf...) fix the three beetle spawns in the Necrosis
Beetle camp in Sebilis. At present, all three spawns ALWAYS drop an item
from the planar gems table, and sometimes drop two. Those items (excepting
Crystallized Sulfur) all sell at over 100 plat each to vendors. That means a
group of six doing that camp pulls in 100 plat each per hour just killing
those three mobs. They weren't always like this - it got added in a few
patches ago.
