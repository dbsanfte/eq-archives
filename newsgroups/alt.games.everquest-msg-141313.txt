I think the OP meant something along the lines of 'keep all your old stuff
and start a new class'... which people already do, it's called "twinking"
:o)

... if he also meant something like "keep all your old stats and
abilities"... for example, when you're level 8 and Root breaks for the 5th
time, you revert from Cleric mode into lvl 60 Monk mode, wig-out, and kick
that Orc Cents' head clear across EC... people already do that as well...
it's called dual-box PLing... although that needs 2 accounts and 2 PCs (and
about 3 arms, an extra pair of eyes, or a neck that can rotate thru 360
degrees)

It's a nice idea... but Verant will just see it as a way to avoid class
based item restictions and they've said in the past 'no multi-classing...
that's what Hybrids are for".

On the other hand... they've also said 'No horses... ever!' and 'No druid
ports on Luclin', so I'd wait until the full list of features for Planes of
Power is and what they say about 'new ways to advance' :o)
