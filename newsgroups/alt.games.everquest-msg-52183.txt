Depends on the situation. I will do it if I have plenty of mana, and
things just aren't dying fast enough for me. I love charming shamans
and wizards especially. Sometimes charm breaks early, but if you're
prepared, it shouldn't be a problem..

I once actually tried to charm at the seb entrance with some paladin
(for heals). It didn't go well ;). I have charmed in Chardok with a
druid (he can charm dogs, too, if he wants) a couple of times. That's
been going pretty well.

Sometimes I charm stuff just because it's fun. I like to practice,
just in case I actually do need it. I want to have experience charming
both inside and outside a dungeon.
