I have my spells linked to 2 keys - the numbers in the top row and 
ctrl+numpad#.  That way I can cast my lower 5 spells while mousing,
as well as all of them when my hand is on the numpad (which is where
my hotkeys are, and auto-attack are).

I also keep them similar between mage and BL (IE - attack spells
in slots 1 and 2, pet heal in 4)
