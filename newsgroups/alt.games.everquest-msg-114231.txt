Not really.  From level 1-10 you lose no experience on death...but EQ2
(according to the thread starter, I haven't verified it, nor do I
particularly care to research vaporware) DOES INDEED have a death penalty.
He mentioned something about a "deficit."  I don't have any idea how that
would work, but it's SOME sort of penalty.

Boy, EQ would royally SUCK if there was no xp loss on death.
