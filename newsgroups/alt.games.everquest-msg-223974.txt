Damn, almost looks like you're screwed. Do post those e-mails in the
quest section of the shaman's crucible if you would. People need to
know, if only to prevent a lot of pain on tear turnins until this gets
fixed.   

If that really is the new stance of the GMs on this issue, they just
screwed a whole lot of shaman working on their epic since a large
percentage of the spawns have been buggy lately. Trial of patience had
the quest mobs poof due to pathing, CoM had mobs eating turnins, Kirn
was being triggered and respawning at the far end of the dungeon just
to name a few that raise peoples faction when they do the turnin 

. ... with what the GM is saying, most shaman currently working on
their epic are probably fucked since odds are they had to repeat at
least one of the steps due to bugs. I still think the GMs are talking
out of their ass and haven't really thought it through, the
repercussions of that policy would be a customer service nightmare.
Since you left in his e-mail addy, I'll send him a copy saying
basically what I said above, maybe it will help. 

Rgds, Frank
