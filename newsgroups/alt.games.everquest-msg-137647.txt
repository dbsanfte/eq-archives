Which troll? There have been so many of them lately.  There's the racist
SPAM idiot (that I can only hope is reincarnated as a short, fat, black,
jewish bald guy from Afganistan) the guy who keeps complaining that some
other guy is saying bad things about his daughter, the guy that says he
hasn't been saying bad things about anyones daughter but he does like to
swap partners, then the guy that "works" for Sony that is trying to warn us
all about some great EQ conspiracy (I guess)  Oh yeah then there was the kid
who wanted to buy an account (or maybe sell one-I dont remember) and then
said he was really his sister and then he was a Dad and was mad at everyone
for yelling at his kid-but I think he went away-

and wasn't there some guy having some trouble with women???

Can we just ignore them all?
