Rangers do need taunt, even after you get Jolt.

Let's say that I've been a good boy, keeping my aggro well below Mr.
Warrior - let's assume I'm practicing 2hb or something.  The cleric hasn't
been paying attention and the MT is down to 20 pct health.  Cleric kicks off
a CH and the mob is all over him like ugly on a troll.  I have three
options:

1)  Taunt.  I have a 1 in 3 chance of being at the top of the aggro list and
the cleric is safe; I can pass aggro to the warrior at his convenience.  If
both the warrior and I taunt, the chances one of us will get aggro instantly
approach 50-50.

2)  Snare/Flamelick.  If my aggro is really low, both of these may not be
enough to get over the cleric's taunt.  If my aggro was relatively high, I
could end up with a ton of aggro and the warrior won't be able to get it off
of me until he gets a successful taunt - and even then, the effect of
Flamelick can cause ping-pong (remember Flamelick is a DoT).

3)  Root.  If the cleric pays attention to my all-caps hotkey that the mob
is rooted, he's safe if he moves.  If he stands there like a dolt trying to
channel heals off on himself, he's dead.

The 'correct' answer is all three - fire Taunt, if I get aggro stop.  If I
don't, fire Snare; if I get aggro stop.  If I don't, fire Flamelick.  If I
get aggro, stop.  If I don't, Root the mob and spam the "Mob is rooted, BACK
UP" key.

You can see how Taunt is the most sure form of control; it has a
one-in-three chance of working and allows me to pass aggro as needed.  Snare
and Flamelick have no guarantees of getting aggro, and can generate enough
aggro if both are used that the warrior will have a challenge getting aggro
back.  Root is the most sure, but depends on the healer realizing he has to
vamoose.

Taunt isn't the answer to every situation - but it is AN answer.
