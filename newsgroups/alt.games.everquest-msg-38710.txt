Ah ok, let me think... um... 

2 Diamond wedding or whatever rings, plus 7 all resists, yeah
you could go for the diamond velium instead but you pay a mint for
just 2 more resist per res (with the two rings)

That oracle cape thing from CC that can drop off any cleric one as a
rare (crystal caverns) its like 2 wis but more importantly has like 5
mr.. which is kind of a rare res for a druid, and 10 cold res also.

That silver chain thing that is really nice at 5 ac, 30 hp, 30 mana,
plus 5 all resists and is a pretty good 50 or so plus druid solo
quest.

Shroud of nature which is like plus 8 fire and 8 cold. 

Was using book of rings from droga which is 8 wis and plus 10 or
something fire and cold. 

Mostly wear giant scale mail sleeves but can switch them out with verm
ones for 7 more MR, but don't really have to now.

Was wearing the froglok crown which was 20 cold 20 fire, now wear Blue
diamond tiara which is plus 8 all or something. bought that from guild
jeweler for 2 k.. probably a bargain.

2 bd electrum earrings and if you know a max or near max jeweler and
have the gems you can easily get them to make these with no failure.

Swapped out the book of rings recently for Lodizal shield, which adds
a good magic res.

Oh, also have electrum diamond mask to plop on when really need more
res, otherwise wear the velium ruby face thingie.

I was kinda in the same place and went from virtually no res to good
ones fast, its just having the will power to take off those plus 6 or
7 wis rings and wear diamond resist ones all the time instead.

Before I got the lodizal shield I think I was at like 186 wis with
good resists all the time.

A couple of the diamonds and BD I got from that Swarm mother  thing in
North karana and I think I got at least one BD from the otter quest
with the ulthork horns before they nerfed ti some. Cold seems the
easiest to get really up there for a druid with magic being kind of
hard.

Skyshrine tunic and legs and I'd be feeling really good about resists
and wis.
