I could get maybe 1 to 1.5 bubbles of xp in an evening at 51. That's
an evening in Old Sebilis, against pretty-much non-stop pulls. If you
have more time to spend than me (e.g. if you're single) this would
easily increase to 2 to 2.5 bubbles.

So, in theory, yes. You could get thru one level (50+) in a weekend.

I took a much more relaxed attitude to xp once I hit level 50. I was
progressing very slowly with most of my time spent socialising,
raising trade skills, or concentrating on one of my alts.

I was exactly half way through level 50 when I joined a raid on the
Plane of Growth. The melee group I was in just happened to be the one
which was getting around 80% of the xp. I ended the raid a tiny sliver
away from levelling. Half a level (50) in one session!  :)

I hope that helped answer your question.
