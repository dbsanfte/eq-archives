Ranger? Easy, whenever you need to find your targets with track. Now you 
could point out that bards and druids also have track, but their track 
doesn't sort by distance, which is important in an xp situation. And 
furhtermore, unlike EQ2, track is spread between three highly disparate 
classes. A druid, bard, and ranger are not the same base class... 
rangers are high dps, druids are decent healers, and bards are ... 
bards. There are several outdoor zones where a group could not 
effectively xp without the ranger pulling with track.

Mage. Yup. This is one of the classes that got shat on, comparatively 
speaking. They are a fairly generic dps class. EQ1 needs to give them 
more niche use. However, CoH is pretty handy, and completely unique.

Cleric. Your kidding right. Take your group *anywhere* they are likely 
to die a couple times (like a low 50s group to Howling Stones or Acrylia 
Caverns), and a cleric is indispensible if you want to walk away from 
the evening with more xp than you started with.

This is a great example of what I'm arguing. The druid can, *provided he 
has a slower*. IOW the druid doesn't have the tools himself, he relies 
on someone elses. In EQ2, so far at least, the priest classes each have 
its own tools to make up for its own shortcomings... at least so far it 
seems to have worked out like that.

In EQ1, if you don't have a cleric, you can 'build' one out of other 
classes... a druid plus a slower plus a paladin has enough healing, and 
even a half decent rez, and you've also picked up a tank and a good bit 
of utility too... in EQ2, if you don't have a cleric, you just get a 
druid or a shaman. Group composition in EQ1 is an art, you can make a 
large number of groups work, but in EQ2, you just pick one of each 
archetype, and fill the rest.
