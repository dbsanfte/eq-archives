I have to admit, I've always used a combination of my 2 assist keys and
manuevering + F8.

I have a primary assist key (hotkey 4 on all banks for all characters)
this is my raid MA key, my group primary assist key, etc.  

/assist tank_name  - this always needs changing when the MA changes.
the problem, of course, is when I forget to change it after a raid
(I haven't yet forgotten before a raid - I always double check the
MA/SA and set my MA/SA keys appropriately)

I also have an SA key (almost exclusively for raids)

I also have a key on my programmable keypad that's simply /assist <enter>
which allows me to F# then assist, or assist a mob, or assist my pet
(very handy when 2 mobs are tagging him, as both my elementals and
my tiger like to occasionally switch in these circumstances - very bad
for a mage to nuke the one that's not being hit)

Finally, there are many times when I want the unengaged mob (to get my
pet on for tanking, to get a slow on with my BL and now to get mezzed
with my new bard).  Because of my vision I can waste precious seconds
finding my cursor onscreen; as a result I /assist to find the engaged
mob then move and f8 to get the unengaged mob.
