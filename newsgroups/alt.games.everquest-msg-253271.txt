I vote no.

It doesn't seem to be using a bug; charm is working as intended, mobs 
are working as intended, there's no pathing exploiting involved...

The fact that someone is using tools put at his disposal to gain 
experience in ways the designers may not have considered doesn't make it 
an exploit, if it DID, then kiting would be an exploit, if I recall 
correctly reading years ago that this idea was a complete surprise to 
the designers (Verant, at the time)

I did something similar with my cleric; I'd pull a mob over to some non 
KOS to me mobs (giants to coldains in GD, for example), get them to 
fight, then root the "guards", kill the fleeing giants, and atone the 
guards.

Was this an exploit?  Quite possibly, its at least as subject to that 
interpretation as what  you are doing.  My point is, in my opinion no it 
wasn't, and I did it quite happily for as long as I wanted.

Splendid
