From the shadows, the mysterious "Blacken_Blue"
<revenant71@comcast.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

>1. Do items that have Haste on them affect things like Bash, Tiger Claw,
>Kick, Taunt, Round Kick, Archery, etc, or do they just affect standard melee
>attacks?

For all of those I know (not being a monk) yes. Don't think taunt gets
hasted though.


>2. Do Haste items work for any character who can equip them, or do you have
>to be a certain level for each of them to work? (I'm looking for a Haste
>item for a lvl 15 Human Monk, to be specific)

Someone else more sure than me will answer that.

>
>3. What is the cheapest buyable perma-haste item, and what is the % on it?

You don't want the cheapest, you want the cheapest decent one, and
thats probably those who start at 21% (like fbss) or close to it.
Going with one slower than that will just be a waste of money most
likely.
