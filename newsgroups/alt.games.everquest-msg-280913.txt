I haven't started any new characters since the tutorial got changed
to exit to PoK, so I was only vaguely aware of the change until one
night a few weeks ago, when I saw someone in PoK /ooc asking where
the halflings are.  He got told Rivervale, and then asked how to get
there.  I was headed there anyway (as my halfling druid), so I found
the guy and led him to Misty via the Rivervale book.  Once there, he
asked again where to find the halflings, so I started to tell him
the way to the city, but then paused to /con him.

He was a dark elf, but hey, my iksar can walk safely in Rivervale;
still, given he was clearly a true newbie, and level 10, I decided
to ask him why he wanted to go there.  He explained that he'd just
gotten out of the tutorial, and had found his newbie armor quests
in PoK, and those quests required him to kill some halflings.

I turned around and led him back through PoK to show him the way to
Nektulos and Neriak, and aimed him at the halflings in Nek that the
armor quests are designed to use.  (It felt more than a bit weird
for my halfling to be aiding him in his quest to kill those guys!)
