One case where everquest != historical basis, is this bit about clerics
being the most powerful healers.  As spiritual leaders go, I believe it
was the more shamanistic types who were likely to know a lot about
first-aid.  Your average christian priest in fancy robes was not a
healer...he was most likely a politician of sorts.

In all of the priest classes cases though, the healing is believed to come
from the "god/spirits".  So this further implies that the christian-esque god is
a tougher healer than them pagan spirits and druidy-type gods.

Grrr....

It's completely non-intentional of course.  Clerics in norrath worship
many gods, so I don't believe Verant is making any religous statements.
