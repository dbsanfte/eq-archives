  SCHEDULED PATCH JULY 24

     This from the scheduled downtime page: 

     On Wednesday, July 24th, at 3AM PDT,
     (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be
     brought down for a scheduled patch. The
     estimated downtime is 5 hours.

      - The EverQuest Operations Team 

       We asked Alan VanCouvering if this patch would put
       the new User Interface and the Bazaar on the Live
       Servers. Here was the response: 

       Yes - As a part of the rollout for the new
       interface, Beta Two of the new UI and the
       Bazaar will begin on the Live servers as of the
       next patch.


       It's had an excellent few weeks overall on the
       Test Server and we'll be running it on the Live
       servers in an optional mode until we're
       satisfied with it. We'll give details about how
       to turn these options on in the patch
       message. 

                         - Alan 

       Should be a great day for EQ'ers if all goes
       smoothly! 

End cut and paste.

Yeah.  I somehow doubt that it's all going to go smoothly, but I am still looking
forward to it.
