I'm not sure why you mention level 45 specifically, because the only magic
numbers I've heard are 1-10, and 30.  So I'll assume you use that level just
'cause that's YOUR most recent hell level.

Anyway, Verant said that it's still going to take the same amount of
experience to get from 1-50.  Obviously (to me, anyway) if hell levels don't
require as much experience as before, non-hell levels are going to require
more...and that's going to slow down your blue bubbles per kill.
