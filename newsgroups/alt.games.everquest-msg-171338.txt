Prices on Povar tend to be a bit lower on a number of the items you listed
above, but the point is definitely made.  I was mainly pointing out to the
OP how it can be done even by mid level characters.  Your method is even
better.  Hmm.  Green goblin skins are bazaar material?  I feel like a chump,
as I must have sold a few thousand plat's worth (at your prices) of the
things to vendors for pennies on the dollar.  I'll know better for next
time.
