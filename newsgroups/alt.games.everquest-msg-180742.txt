Well, we are debating/arguing/whatever, which makes us adversaries
of a sort.  But I've taken no offense, and I apologize if I've given
any.  Deflation preceded the bazaar, the first big (and I mean very
big) wave of deflation was in the aftermath of Kunark.

It was affected by the quality of some of the high end smithed armors,
and also by the high-end players pushing their smithing for seru-bane
weapons (they're NODROP, so they had to make their own) after the
smithing skill-up nerf.  Suddenly there was a fair demand for Padding
from players who had pp and were totally uninterested in dealing with
yet another time sink.

MoSS is a special case, similar to the Mace of the Fallen Crusader
from PoP.  When supply totally outstrips demand prices collapse.
On FV this happens with a lot more items than it does on standard
rules servers.  So the Goranga Club on FV (now at 100pp according
to Khosh) is ho-hum, but the MoSS and the MotFC tent to stand out
on the standard servers.

"man" has yet to annoy me.  "bro" sometimes annoys, depends on the
source.  "dude" is almost always annoying (even "pally" is less
irritating, probably because it refers to a toon, not me personally).
To me, "dudes" are nerds from the city clumsily experiencing a taste
country life at a boarding ranch ("dude ranch") out west.  I guess
that dates me.  Even so, I didn't take offense, and I did go get
another cup of coffee.  :)
