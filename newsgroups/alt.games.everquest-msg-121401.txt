That's pretty much what I meant.  Kids and those of a kid-like mentality
want to find boundaries and push them.  Sometimes it's necessary to have
those boundaries and enforce them.  Indeed, I believe that most of the
problems with Britain's unruly youth is down to the fact that we have
endless queues of do-gooders telling us we shouldn't be 'restricting their
freedom of expression' by imposing rules on them.  That means that, in order
to achieve the peer respect previously gained from, say, chewing gum in
class, they now have to smash windows, steal or take drugs.  Tighten the
rules again and I honestly think you'd reduce juvenile offending, because
they wouldn't have to go so far to be 'daring'.

On the other hand, I'm not an insane authoritarian.  Where a rule has to
exist it should be enforced, but as you say, sometimes the existence of a
restriction only serves to encourage the behaviour it exists to restrict.
In this case, I agree with you.  It's the expected response to profanity
which encourages them to use it.

Agreed.
