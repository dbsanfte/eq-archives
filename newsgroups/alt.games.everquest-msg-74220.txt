Multi-hour quest resulting in a failure doesn't seem like "working
properly". "As intended" until the number of Ghoulbanes no longer
outnumber the total number of paladins on a given server, possibly,
but not "properly".

Comparititely cheap in EC these days, although the price is coming
back up as people find out that the quest is broken, and paladins who
have set GB aside (for whatever reason) want to try it out with
Instument of Nife. Still, if he's epic-ready, simply buying one would
be the easiest solution.
