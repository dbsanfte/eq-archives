Because we are talking about a level 34 non twinked ranger. A couple of
people keep ignoring it.

Why half the people in this newsgroup have to respond off topic or morp
every thread from "What is the wood elf starting city?" into "What equipment
my Shaman uses on raids" or "How I would twink an Iskar" is beyond me. Just
start a new thread, it doesn't cost anything.

You also have to understand that it isn't an exhaustive list. I mean do I
really have to tell you every reason why you want a smaller, lighter weapon?
I mean I can go on how often you have to bank or staying under your weight
limit for when you get hit with a debuff spell and all the other reasons but
I was hoping for a little bit of game knowledge on your part.

If you want to change the topic to level 50+ rangers or twink equiping a
ranger, then change the heading, start another thread, or make it clear you
aren't offering anything related to the topic started by original poster.
