Hi there.

> do u think everquest is a newbie friendly game? 

It will be a lot friendlier when you get in if you learn to spell out
"you" instead of "u". :-)  But I digress. "Friendly" isn't what you'll
usually get at first, but if you're a nice person and play well with
others, you'll make new friends fast enough. It's like the real world in
that regard. If you have a lot of friends IRL, you likely will in
Norrath as well.

> do i have many possibilities in the game as a newbie? 

Almost limitless. Of course, to get up to the high end of the game and
see all the exciting places and gear that you'll see others wearing and
hear them talk about will take a good long while. But you might enjoy
yourself along the way.

> what servers should i play on 

Doesn't matter anymore. You can't even tell what servers are most or
least populated. Just pick one and give it a shot. But you should be
aware that there are a few servers that are "PVP" (Player vs. player)
where the other players can kill you (and you them). You have to decide
if this is for you. They all have names that end in "Zek". If you dont'
want to have to worry about the other players killing you, pick one of
the others.

> and what character class should i use for my first character? 

Doesn't matter at all. Pick one that sounds interesting and try it. If
you like it, keep going. If not, make a new character and start over.
You'll probably have many characters before your'e done if you keep
playing.

> or just post a link to a good tutorial site or sth like this :)

There's a bunch, but one of the very best for bare bones newbie
information on all the classes, their abilities, skills, advice on
creation, etc. is http://www.castersrealm.com/   Give that a shot and
read up on the various classes.

>  and btw when does the new add-on go live?

Last I heard, probably December.
