According to this post on EQ Clerics:

http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=11282

change is a-comin' to the Ragefire spawn.

The poster quotes, with permission, a private email she got from Rich
Waters:

"Ragefire - we've got a change in progress, it should work well and relieve
the pressure on clerics. It's still got work associated with it, so it's not
an epic freebie, but it will be a lot more attainable in the future."

The poster is a cleric on the Test server who often talks with Rich about
new changes and stuff.

I'll wait and see - I remember the last change they made, moving RF from
SolB to Skyfire, that was supposed to make things better.  9_9

Still, there have been CS nightmares that have resulted in some questionable
GM behavior - the anonymous zone-wide threatening messages to Skyfire about
the consequences of petitioning about Ragefire; the decision on Xev to spawn
four Ragefires in two days to deal with a contested spawn there.  Verant has
to be getting tired of dealing with this, and is quite likely to be
motivated to finding a solution that will make life easier on their GM's.

The effect it has on players is another thing altogether.  :)
