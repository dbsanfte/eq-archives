I wasn't so much argueing that people will/won't leave, I was argueing your
stance that the minority is the people that think this is wrong.  Do I think
anyone will leave, not really.  Do I think people are going to look at Norath
different, yes.  I personally now feel that I not only have to watch what I am
doing, but when I'm on a raid I now will have to watch the tactics of EVERYONE
on the raid.  Think about that for a minute.  Because of my class I'm not in the
pull group, does that mean I could be susbended becase they exploit, what if a
couple of the casters set themselves up in a place that in a safe spot...  That
is the side of this most of us are concerned with.  When I am not exploiting but
my group is.  Gonna make pick-up raids a lot less frequent.
