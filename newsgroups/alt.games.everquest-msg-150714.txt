Druid can quad kite at 34 period. Not all druids do it at 34 tho..

Simple put they snare 4 mobs, run around till they are packed together then
use Lightning Strike (AE DD) on the mobs till they stop or are dead. And
finish off the remaining ones. Med up and seek 4 more victims..tada DRUID
KITING.

I started around 36 orso with Split Paw gnolls.
