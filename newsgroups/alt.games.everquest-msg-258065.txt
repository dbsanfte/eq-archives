Yea, I can see that.  Generally, my pet is parked as far from the pull 
path and the actual fight as can reasonably be managed.  Which means AOE 
goes off on the pull, pet goes 'trundle, trundle, trundle, I'm'a walkin' 
over to the mob now!' And I hit /pet back off long before it gets there.  
So what one attack?

It's not like enchanters even -get- this fabulous /pet hold thingy... 
Suspend Minion might work, but is there really a point, if we assume I'm 
actually paying attention?

Actually, the thing I don't get about your response... if everyone isn't 
ready, what's that mob doing within aoe range of camp?  I mean, I can see 
exceptions, like GtW, whose aoe is massive in the tiny little tunnels we 
pull to, but not nearly as many as the number of mobs on which they just 
say 'no pets without /pet hold!'
