}Sneak drops when you interact with someone, IIRC, but wolf form is okay

}(didn't know about the DEs in SRo, d'oh!) and sneak dropped when I 
}handed em in and she said the "I loathe you and I'm keeping your items, 
}neener" line and - yeah.  No more GLSs. :/

Wolf form works with people on freeport militia faction... Pandos is on 
the various elven factions I think, despite the fact he's a dwarf.  So I 
wouldn't count on it.  On the allakhazam page for the quest, there's a 
description of a very clever way of doing it with harmony and camo.  I 
never -thougt- of using harmony for handins... mmm. :)
