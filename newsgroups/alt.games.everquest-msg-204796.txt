My brother-in-law used to window shop before he quit playing; he'd go
to traders to see what they had to offer. If he looked for something
specific and saw a trader had it, he'd track the trader.  He mentioned
that he didn't know how a character without tracking could find
anything except by wantering around reading the trader's names when I
explained how everyone else does it.
