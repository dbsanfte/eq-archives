Probably is a memory hole on Sonys behalf, my 2 PC's also crash
(freqently). dbg txt shows this:

[Thu Nov 20 22:20:20 2003]02140:Process was trying to READ invalid
data.

[Thu Nov 20 22:20:20 2003]02141:Invalid access occurred at virtual
address 0x00000000

I am no programmer, but its defenatly a memory issue with the last
patch. Hopefully they will fix it..... QUICK
