I pre-ordered LDoN (which makes me a fool apparently according to some
'informed' guy on serverwide.beastlords).

I couldn't log in afterwards, the character selection screen reverted
to pre luclin graphics and any attempt to login in further led to a
'You have been Disconnected' message.

I solved it by logging onto station.com, accessing my account there
and cancelling the preorder, my toon is 53 but has no AA's to lose so
that issue didn't affect me.


Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.
