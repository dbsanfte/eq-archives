Yes, I re-looked at the motherboard manual and it takes 256MB sticks if they
are double sided (which cost a tad more and harder to get)....  Anyhow, I
went and bit the bullet and bought them and it makes an INCREDIBLE
difference.
Zoning takes 10-20 sec instead of 45.
Loading EQ takes about a minute instead of 4.  Even loading PoK is heaps
faster!!
Have also been able to increase the graphics quality to high and it's still
fine.
Quitting EQ used to take a min or two also and now takes about 10 sec.
Very happy.
Now... I'm of to attempt the bazaar.  (never been there b4 - to daunting...)

Oh yeah - I missed your comment about the board being able
to only accept 128Mb sticks.  Usually, this is not true.  I have
seen lots of older mobos that say stuff like that but will work
just fine with 256Mb sticks, either as-is or with a simple BIOS
update.
