Welp, this weekend my guild has intentions of going into the hole to
pickup the Dragon Scale for a Warriors epic. 
Does anyone know if the spawn spot of Nortlav Scalekeeper has been
moved? and if so where he was moved to? 

Is anyone aware of a forum / webpage discussing changes to the Hole.
Yes I know the changes are recent, but sometimes people are quick to
put up the information. 

Thanks for your time and input.
