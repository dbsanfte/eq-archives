This has been a known problem with Windows 2000 for well over a year now.
Since WindowsXP is pretty much Windows 2000 with a facelift and a few
hundred megs of useless utilities, it is no suprise that the sound problems
that plagued Windows 2000 also exist on Windows XP.  What have the Windows
2000 users done to solve this problem?  Turn off your music.  It's annoying
anyway.
