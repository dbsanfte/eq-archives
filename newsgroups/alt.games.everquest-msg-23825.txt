After reading about the Bread Run quest in Karana (by the way, thanks
for that, it took me through 27 and 28 without breaking a sweat... At 29
I find I gain experience faster by fighting), and the notion that it
would raise your Coalition of Tradesfolk faction so much that a Druid
could do the Stein of Moggok quest, I decided to give it a try.

Being a druid makes getting the book trivially easy, even dispensing
with the need to have a Temple Pool mule, but I've found that two levels
worth of bread runs haven't been enough to raise my faction to the level
where Clurg will give me the Stein (he does take the book just fine,
thank you very much). He mentions, in so many words, that I should raise
my faction with him further.

So, is there a relatively fast way to raise Clurg faction without
screwing up any others? I hope the bread run is not the only one,
because I'm a bit weary of it, and since Jarlen Meadowgreen is not a
merchant, he gets killed a lot, which slows down the proceedings even
further.

On a related note... Do wisdom casters benefit from higher INT for trade
skills/swimming/foraging and suchlike?

Thanks!
