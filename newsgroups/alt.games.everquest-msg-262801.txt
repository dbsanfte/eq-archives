It may have something to do with your server. I've always noticed that
the game experience seems to vary considerably from server to server.
Particularly many of the bad experiences people keep reporting, I've
never encountered on FV, but seemed to encounter almost all the time
on ARo. (and good riddance to that server, blech. played a ranger on
that server, couldn't get a group to save my life.)

Frankly my equipment on FV (for a level 61 Shaman) is quite pathetic
compared to what many people have, particularly those in raiding
guilds. Most of my equipment is in roughly the 150 point range for
LDoN. (Until recently where I've gotten a few hand-me-downs and
awarded an item from a mini-raid we did. Two groups in one of the new
OoW zones.) I used to refuse to get KEI or Virtue/Etc in PoK before
heading out to adventure, just on general principles. I can tell you I
have never been turned down for a group, never even been asked what
gear I have. Now, as for tanks, it's a slightly different story. They
need to be able to take the punishment long enough to get healed by
our available healing crew. Even in that case I've never been in a
group where someone asked a potential tank what their AC/HP was before
inviting them. Though it does restrict the level we are looking for
sometimes, particularly if we lack a cleric. Once they are in the
group, the main tank is chosen based on Class/HP/AC/Level, but never
has someone been dropped from a group because of poor equipment. I've
known people to remember with bemusement the otherwise excellent
paladin of 38 levels who was still wearing mostly banded/ringmail and
some cloth in an LDoN group. The point is: they didn't boot them as
soon as they learned that he had criminally bad equipment. (IIRC they
did a second adventure with him.) I'm pretty sure the Pally in
question was making a point of only equipping with things he was able
to buy from vendors or got as mob drops. He couldn't tank of course,
but he was quite adequate otherwise. (And I hear, quite a hoot to
adventure with.)

Now, on FV you can get Time level equipment in the Bazaar. It's all
droppable. You'd think that would make people more inclined to require
really good equipment on potential group mates because even non
raiders could farm enough to get time equipment, but it actually seems
to have the opposite effect. It's almost as if people realize that any
goober can get decked out in uber equipment, so they put a much higher
premium on skilled players. Reputation plays a huge factor. I get
tells from people all the time while I'm AFK, without LFG on, in the
bazaar, in trader mode, to group. Not because they know I have uber
equipment, (and point-in-fact, until quite recently I was missing some
very important spells. Until a week ago I was using a pet more than 10
levels out of date. It was green to the lowest level people in the
group.) but because I can be relied on to not DoT the mezzes
..usually.

Of course, I'm prepared to hear people tell me my experience is
completely a-typical, but I wouldn't count on it.

These are both more than a month out of date, but both of these
characters were equipped for less than 60k combined. Maybe 20 hours
total (8 hours on one character, 12 hours on the other) getting
experience in the Rockhopper caves and selling the resulting hides and
shards in the bazaar over the course of a few weeks is all it took. An
hour or two a night, more on the weekends. None of the rockhoppers
were green to either character. Gained about 3 levels on one
character, and 4 on the other in that cave. Good times. (of course
some of the items on the characters weren�t simply bought from the
Bazaar. For example the [Eye of the Owlbear Mother] was gotten in a
small group running the War in HSM, the [Steel Ring of the Foot
Soldier] came from those 5th anniversary skellies. The [Rune Crafter�s
Bracer] was a gift from a Troll shaman, who really didn�t have much
use for it. The [Mantle of Ill Omen] was gotten as a drop in Veksar.)

Though, I'm very tired and I think I have gone far afield here. I
shall stop now.
