Well, a serverwide taxi channel would be quite useless :)

But for instance /join serverwide.eqtraders would get you into a chat 
with traders from all servers.  Quite interesting discussions there 
sometime.  /join serverwide.necro:necro gets you into a necro class 
chat.  And so on, and so forth.  Guessing the passwords is usually on 
par with guessing the passwords your parents tend to pick ;)
