   I don't think this often, but I agree with Faned.  

   In  EQ and CoH I tend to be a slow leveler.  I see no big rush to level,
and I have a pretty bad case of altitis.  My friends in game are always
leveling ahead of me.  And that's their prerogative.  The fact that I have
a different play style than most of them certainly doesn't make me any
better than any of them.

   At least in City of Heroes this isn't so much of an issue.  With
sidekicking and explaring, pretty much anyone can play together regardless
of level.  I wonder if other MMORPG's will pick up that this might be a
good thing to copy if they want people who like playing with their friends
to stay in game even if they have different leveling speeds.
