Ok, my first trip was 5 minutes looking at people fighting at the PoJ zone
in a few weeks ago.  I decided to go a bit further.  PoD - I zone in and am
the only person there!  I roam around a bit and see some flies that look
tempting, but I'm a bit reluctant.  Could a 61 Magician and 59 Shaman (or 60
Druid instead of Shaman) take these things out for decent regular or AA
experience?  I went to PoN and ran around a bit.  I was quickly killed by a
treant that must have been able to see invis.  I get a rez and talk with the
cleric for a bit.  She suggests PoV.  I go to PoI instead because I like the
gears and, once again, I'm the only person in the zone.  What happened to
PoD and PoI that nobody's there anymore?  LDoN?  I don't explore much
because there are some "Scowling" mechs in the trench with me that see
invis.  I go to PoV and want to explore, but the PoN treant incident is
stuck in my head.  I watched a group take on "Sergeant Soandso" and a couple
of Servants of Marr for a bit, then zoned back.  Can I explore PoV invis?
Are the mobs there generally hostile in case invis drops or some of them see
invis?
