A friend of mine plays a 55 necro as his main. We've tried partnering
on occasion, without much luck - he still plays as if I am not there.
He has a druid in his teens, which I have tried to partner with with
my SK, and that didn't go much better since he's a heavy soloist (and
pet charmer) with that one as well. Even his mid 20s rogue has been
extensively soloed... he has some of the worst grouping skills I have
ever seen. I think he is improving with his rogue, at least. And his
druid is a much better solo player than mine :)
