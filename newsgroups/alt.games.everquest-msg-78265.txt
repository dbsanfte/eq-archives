No, but when I do a corpse retrieval in Sebilis, Chardok, DN etc etc, it
takes a lot longer then the 5 seconds SoW takes to cast.  SoW also isnt a
direct risk to your life, I put my own chars life at risk more often then
not when doing a C.R, sometimes I've died as a result (if lucks against you
heh.. 3 failed fd's and 5 chain casting mobs on you = dead monk)

And lets be honest, once you gain a few levels SoW isn't even mana heavy in
the slightest
