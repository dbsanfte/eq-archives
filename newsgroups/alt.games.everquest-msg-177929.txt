I really dunno.  I'm kind of feeling my way as I go.  There are some 
pieces that will help both ways though - ie, shadel bandit ring has hp 
*and* mana - I went for pure int rings the first time around.  So when I 
can afford 2k for a shadel... ;p well, yeah.  Need to make more money 
before re-outfitting her.  And when I do, I'll be taking a look through 
other necro profiles to see what they wear.

Well, hey, she's getting even more than that, iirc, just by doing a 
certain PoK quest over and over again ;)

Um... I don't know?  Also, I LOVE the aviaks and centaurs being there.  
I got mad at a friend once because he pulled a centaur - and I wouldn't 
believe there was no faction hit until he'd wiped out the entire village 
;)  Now I waste whatever goes by, including the odd (yum) treant.  Then 
again, I'm a necro.

Hmmm... so what you're saying is, instead of going on a PK rampage, 
she'll kill all of Mistmoore as it pops every time?  *eg*

Players.  It's a frustrating thing, which is why I disagree with those 
who say PoP is a bad thing.  Even with it, few people will move, because 
once you've got a group, you don't want to do anything to jeapordize it.  
So as much as I might be tempted to say "hey guys, this is too easy, 
let's move to DSP," I won't, because I fear that some people will leave 
claiming too long of a run (which it is), and some people like the 'safe 
exp', even if it is boring as hell, and me?  I'm afraid that once we 
lose those people, we'll replace them with someone who just can't play.

Bah.  I say, just give rogues and warriors the ability to solo without 
needing mega gear to do it. ;p  Mind you, I still have an opportunity 
that warriors don't.  If ID ever actually starts working regularly (big 
IF, I know) and I can keep some snare items in my inventory, I'm good to 
go.  I haven't yet looked through poisons to see if any of them snare.  
Now THAT would be nice, what with the new "ten minute buff" idea. :D
