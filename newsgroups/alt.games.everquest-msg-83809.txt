That would be very inefficient indeed, but not what I do with mine. Tap
requires you standing, casting, etc. However, casting dark pact and then
casting leach on a passing low level critter is very effective. Your pet
slays it as soon as it shows up and attacks. But due to that weird
feature of Leach, even if the mob only had twenty hit points, the spell
will keep running for it's full duration, sucking the same amount of
health out of the corpse as it would if the mob were alive.

I'm currently camping the Millers in QHills with my necro, so there's
lots of newbie mobs wandering past. (Snakes are great) I use this tactic
everytime a Miller fight turns nasty and I wind up low health/mana
afterwards.
