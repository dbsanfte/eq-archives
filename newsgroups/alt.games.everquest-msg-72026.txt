Hello all,

Well, new puters are here, hooked up and EQ is loaded.  The only problems we
are now experiencing are completely and totally Cable Modem provider
problems...  LOL

We get the puters set up, tech comes out and sets up 'both' puters.  In the
mean time, Gateway (who managed to send the computers to the correct
address) has mailed our Hub to the Boyfriend's parents in Alabama.  So, the
Hub is on it's way now from parents and we figured we could just take turns
plugging into cable modem until it gets here.  We are paying for 2 IP
numbers simply because we're suckers...  LOL

So, we get my puter set up and working, boyfriend's isn't working.  I mean
it works, but won't access the net.  He calls Charter Tech on phone,
together they 'fix' his puter so it now connects to net.  I come home from
work and now MY computer doesn't connect to net.  We call Charter Tech.
Tech tells us we have a bad Network card.  We call Gateway.  Gateway says
Charter Tech is full of shit.  We call Charter Tech back.  He does the
"foolproof" test to show us that our network card is bad and lo and behold,
it is not the Network card.

So, somewhere, somehow, someway the settings are screwed with Charter so we
are waiting for our Hub to arrive (it should be here today) and THEN we will
call Tech back for our free service call.  SIGH....

As for EQ, it is running GREAT!  The only thing we've noticed is that when
we tried to make a Vah Shir character, an arrow cursor image remained in the
middle of the screen.  Cursor still works fine, but there is this stupid
arrow in the middle of screen...  Doesn't happen with Cory when I set her
back up, just Vah Shir.  Anyone else experience this?

The new textures are great, the characters look good, and all in all it
seems to run just fine with our 512 Meg Ram and 64 Meg GForce2 card.

Just wanted to stop in and say Hello and in case we're still shuffling
around and not checking ng for the next few days, Merry Christmas and Happy
Holidays and so forth!

Be Well!!!
