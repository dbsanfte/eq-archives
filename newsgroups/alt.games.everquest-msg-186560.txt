I'm an underequipped level 52 shadowknight, I'd say to guess I'm not quite
ready to be reaping the planar experience, but that is one statement I'd
love to have someone come and correct.

What level can one first make serious, regular use of the allegedly
ludicrous planar exp? Levelling to 52 was very slow compared to previous
levels, an the zones that are open to me now do not fill me with explosive
excitement - most seem to be a "Bring your own group only" zone with
experience half as good or less than soloing, with a few notable exceptions.
(really enjoyed the night we spent in cobalt scar, and it looked almost
soloable there but its a bit out of the way if you don't pester a wizzy)

Anyway, I'm really after some good info on the planes - if there are
websites that have it that's great, otherwise some war stories from veterans
in here would be appreciated :)

Cheers,
James
