Biggest train I ever saw was one composed of effectively every single gnoll in
Blackborrow trained up to the top floor. No idea the exact total, but I'm pretty
sure it was well more than that.
  Of course, we pulled that train intentionally, so I don't know if it counts.
Took our puller forever to start at the bottom and run all over the zone kicking
every gnoll he saw, too.
