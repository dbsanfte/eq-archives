Somewhat hard to tell you what to get when you don't mention what your
wearing but...

at 30 you might be able to camp for the runed circlet in permafrost, off

You can get Ulthork hide arms in velious in a group, or get lucky and
find them on a merchant in Thurgadin. AC8 -3 dex +3 wis 

Platinum Armbands +3 str +3 wis drops off Reckless Efreet in SolA

Just a few items to get you started.  Allakhazams is a nice resource
still even with some things being moved to his premium pay service.
