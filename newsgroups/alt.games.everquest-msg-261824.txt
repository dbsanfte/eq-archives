Experience with Velious factions would tend to make me not agree with this. 
My ranger (half elf, karana) started out un-KOS in Kael (don't ask me, it
seemed odd at the time to me as well).  My iksar monk, of course, started
out KOS.  Both can become ally and *need* max ally (not one hit below) to do
certain quests.  Perhaps those specific factions started out the same for
everyone.  I never went and conned Tormax with my ranger, for instance.
