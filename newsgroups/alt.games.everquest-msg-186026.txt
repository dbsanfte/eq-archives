Traveling through new, exciting, and exotic lands can be considered
playing too, you know.  It's not all about exp grinding.

The real issue is that fast and easy travel could have been
implemented better.  A system fast and easy for the oldbies,
but unavailable to the newbies, in order to encourage them
to explore the world.  (Porting NPCs that require payment could
even make it fast and easy for the twinks who have already
"been there, done that".)

The game should involve some effort, otherwise the progress
you make is meaningless.  What's next, vendors and a bank in
every zone (with no faction issues) so selling your loot is
easier, too?

: We still explore, we just do it with the ability to get back to our corpses

Quake has even easier CRs.

I agree that EQ is not entirely "casual play" compatible, but
the Portal Books solved one problem while creating another.  They
could have done it better.
