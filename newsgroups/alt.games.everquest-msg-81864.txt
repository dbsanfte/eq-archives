In spite of your purple prose, I think you are basically correct.
There *are* decent arguments that can be made at the social level
to put restrictions on abortion -- that the act of killing a fetus
has social and symbolic meaning that is independent of any questions
of biology, viability, or existence/nonexistence of the soul.

If a pro-lifer wants to come up and say "Hey, I don't care if
it's human or not, I think it's just ooky," then I can argue
on that level.  I will not, however, allow a pro-lifer to beg
the question on biology.  They are simply wrong.

Oh, please, you will have to do better than this, however. Simple
attacks by association ignore the issue.  Nazis also loved their
children.  I gather you think that we should hate our children, then.
Nazis also ate breakfast.  I gather you think that we should never
eat breakfast, lest we be brushed with the killing of Jews.

Do you believe a foot is a human being?  No?  Do you believe
it is "less than human?"  Yes?  Oh my God.  You must be a Nazi.

Save that feces!  There may be a potential human in there.  It's
just in a different stage and form.

Oh, John, you had such promise.  You started out by pointing to
some important social issues and then pulled the standard
pro-life ploy -- back to the biological argument.  You start
out by claiming that whether or not a fetus is *really* a human
is irrelevant, and then end up by basing your argument that
a fetus is, in fact, a human. 

You had a *potentially* good argument. But arguments are like
fetuses sometimes -- potential is not the same as accomplishment.
