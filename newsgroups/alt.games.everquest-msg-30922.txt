Don't ever feel guilty about letting a stranger die, unless it was your
fault.  Death happens to every player, often.  It's not real-life so don't
let this particular real-life emotion affect you.

I'll go a little further.  If you are in a dungeon and you find yourself
outclassed and decide to hit the zone line, don't feel guilty if someone who
is sitting on the tracks gets hit by the train.  Oh, it might be politic to
mumble some minor apology (or not, depending on if he's being a jerk) but
don't feel sorry unless you're making it a habit (after all, one train to
zone is perfectly understandable...3 in an hour means you shouldn't be
there).
