No, he did not order a pizza from Subway, he shouted out that he wanted to
order a pizza, and some dweeb from Subway said I can do that.  Turns out the
dweeb from Subway couldn't.  Now admittedly, the dweeb from Subway had a
Subway emblem on his hat at the time, but, evidently, the person ordering
didn't know that Subway doesn't serve pizzas, or didn't happen to look at
the emblem first.  If you are going to use an analogy, at least try to use
one that fits the story as presented.  If the OP had sent a tell to a druid,
and asked for a port to BBM, then your analogy would be fitting.
