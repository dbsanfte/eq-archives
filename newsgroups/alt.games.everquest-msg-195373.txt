Khura's Focusing?  Same level as Focus of Spirit.  Group Focus.

I would love snare, but, I regularly root and rot mobs in PoN.  Have been 
doing so since level 57.  Yes, DoTs (aside from epic) do break root, 
probably around 50% of the time on the mobs I do in PoN.

No question, I remember trying to be the main healer, or having to take 
over because the cleric went down in a pickup group, and being completely 
unable to keep up.

Depends a lot on where you hunt.  Hunting in PoP, any slowable mob should 
be slowed, the fights will last long enough to make a huge difference.  If 
you are partnering, or in a small group, then, again, most anywhere you 
hunt, slow is worth doing.

At level 58 we get our gimp CH.  Cann down to below 25% health, cast gimp 
CH.  Takes about 2 cycles to get to 95% mana, 95% health after I root rot a 
mob in PoN, without KEI.  With KEI, I can go 3 or more mobs before I need 
to do a canni cycle.

No question, dogdog is decent.  I still use him for most nonPoP soloing.

Druids start to outpace shaman as healers at some point, high 50s I think.  
I have been the main healer in group many times however, and, barring major 
adds or such, can keep up with it, except for some of those healing hell 
levels in the 40s or so.  At 61, so long as I am not also the main slower, 
I can keep a group going in PoI, but, CC is really needed then.  If I have 
to slow, buff, and heal, then there will be downtime eventually, even with 
KEI, and a mount.
