I believe that the first plane of Hell (which would mean the ones who never
really did anything extremely bad other than refuse God's love to others)
could very well be eternal solitude in whatever place you generally hide
behind your wall or your arrogance or greed or lust or whatever as you have
refused God's salvation and love. (I've actually seen where I was destined
to go to Hell in a vision and it was not a pretty sight, there wasn't any
fire or monsters just complete silence and no one around at all but me and
darkness and garbage on the floor and a mildewy smell.) I believe that if
you have a relationship with Jesus then you will be saved from this but to
be sure you need to connect to other people who need someone to love them
through which God's love can flow to them.

I don't have a clue what other things will be in Hell, but I know where I
was headed and I want to make very sure I don't end up there. I can only
assume that people who commit suicide end up here as well.

I'm not too concerned with the other planes of Hell other than no matter
what you have done, God will forgive you if you let him into your life and
let him try to guide you to a life that will ultimately make you much
happier.

I could see myself regularly going into the 1st plane of Hell carrying a dim
lantern and trying to guide people out of there or at least talking to them.
I guess I only have 41 months left to save as many people as I can from
there including people I may have helped put there myself through my foolish
and careless actions.

Ultimately most of the people who will end up in Hell will be there not
because they were some horrible monster, but just because they refused God's
healing love and salvation and decided they wanted to be alone, and alone
they shall be unless someone reaches them before then. There are only two
people I know of who may end up there, so I will need to basically pray for
them every night as that is the best thing you can do to save someone, other
than showing them love.

The sad thing is that many people will go to Hell and there is nothing
anyone can do about it. It makes it sound in the Bible that about 50% will
go to Hell and 50% will go to Heaven. That would mean that out of my mother
and father it is likely only one of them will go to heaven, and I've
actually had a vision concerning that as well, it will be my father who was
brought up in an athiest environment, and I believe that he just gave his
life to the Lord a few days ago, whereas my mother was brought up in a
Christian environment and rejected God and is probably going to go to Hell
for it. It's not about being good or bad, it's about rejecting God when you
know that you are unhappy and you know what to do about it and you don't
because you think you are smarter and wiser than God. YOU ARE NOT!!!
