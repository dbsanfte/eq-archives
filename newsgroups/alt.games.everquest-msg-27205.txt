He he,
If you have wolf form nothing aggros you. As my Druid is lvl40 nothing
much chases him so its not too bad as long as you know your way out. It
helps if you snare him first though that gives you a bit more time.
One last thing, if you have bad faction with the hags you will die as
they join in and nuke you to death.
