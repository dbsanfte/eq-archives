By the way, I think there might be a bug on how spell damage is calculated.
When my Wizard was 49, a friend had a friend who was a 60 Wizard with a
spare copy of Ice Comet, which he was going to give to me.  We met, I took
and scribed the spell, and my friend told me to try it out on myself.  He
was a Cleric, and buffed me up to about 1800 hitpoints.  I cast Ice Comet on
myself, which does about 1200 points of damage....and *died*.

Note that 1200 points is more than my unbuffed hitpoints.  My guess is that
if one spell does more than your unbuffed hitpoints, you can die from it,
even if you are buffed to have enough to take it.

We did not try this again to see if it was a fluke or not.

If there is indeed a bug in this area, those mobs with 925 point damage are
going to be very bad for most casters.
