Yes,  the PVP reduction kicks in when you use it on yourself.  Also,
if you're kiting, and the mob is moving, you have the same 33% damage
reduction.  It's still a very efficient way to get exp, since you take
no damage, but duo with someone who can root and DoT with you, and
you'll really tear through the exp.
