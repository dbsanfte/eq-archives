That sounds about right for getting there.  I couldn't say for all the 16-44
spells, I don't have a research class caster that I have played high enough
for me to bother with digging into that information.  So far I have found
all the spells that guildies and friends have asked me to bring back for
them (mage, wizzie, enchanter).  Still no necro spells located yet though,
so of course, those were the most requested.
