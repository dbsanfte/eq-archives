5$ to 1000pesos all occurs in the same universe. Norrath and its moon, 
and its planes are, by there premises, not part of this one. The *only* 
violation of the premise allowed is your ability to control and see your 
characters, and that only because its strictly necessary to play the game.

As far as your character is concerned it did come out of nowhere.

Where does an EQ character get $200? He doesn't.

Seeing as there is no way for a character in a fantasy rpg to withdraw 
cash from a CIBC or Paypal bank account... the chain doesn't have a start.

I'd agree if I thought you were really thinking.

Now your confusing your subscription fee which lets *you* control your 
character, with transfering money to your character.

Might as well argue that buying a book is the same as transferring items 
to the characters in it.

Even if you had your dollariums from the wayfarers, that still doesn't 
justify them getting sent over to a bank in New Yorkium via Western 
Unionium -- because they're still in the wrong universe.

A writer could try to gloss cazic thules convenient heart attack too. 
That doesn't make it any less stupid.
