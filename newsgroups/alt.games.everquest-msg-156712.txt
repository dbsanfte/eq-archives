53 Levels as a Monk (retired earlier this year).....
51 Levels as a Druid (retired 1.5+ years ago)...
44 Levels as a Beastlord (Still my main)...

8 Levels as a Magician (as of last night, trying something new).....

So there I was minding my own business learning the ropes of being a
Mage in East Commonlands (I haven't played a mage in 3 years, and
never past level 6), when this hapless monk asks if I want to form a
group. We determine that I am level 8 and he is level 7. "Sure" I
say.....then the fun begins....

Death 1...or....Level 7 Monks don't Feign...
I med to full and pull a Wisp. I am nuking while my firepet tanks. The
monk joins in and starts to take a beating. Before I get a chance to
type "back off" (to let the pet tank) he's down.

Death 2...or.."Goner" lives up to his name....
I pull a Woodland Lion. My pet and the monk are tanking. Things are
going well until another Woodland Lion adds. I have just enough time
to type " /g run" before my pet is toast and the monk goes down again.
This time I join him in a dirt nap. On the plus side we did kill the
first lion and we both dinged (me-9 him-8).

Death 3...or...The Monk has had enough....
We regroup and head back to Inn1. I see a sigle wisp, and fire off a
nuke to pull. Oops, it was really 2 wisps stacked on a spawn
point...This time I give the monk enough warning, and he wisely does
not engage. I take my beating (and the trip back to my bind point).
When I get there I discover that the monk has disbanded from the
group. I can't imagine why hehehehe

I've grouped with a lot of bad players over the years. Now I can
confidently say that I have joined their ranks. I sincerly hope that I
didn't scar the monk for life. :-)

Just goes to show that anyone can be a "newb" :-)
