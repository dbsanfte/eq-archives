Reading this gave me a UO flashback to where the screen would grey out and
you would be at the same spot as a ghost and watch your killers emote all
sorts of nasty things at your dead corpse. I reckon we could do with some of
that in EQ - damn it used to get the blood boiling and really instill some
motivation...

New MoB AI anyone?

*Gorenaire does a victory dance ending with a moonwalk*

Gorenaire: "lol - u guys suxor"

*Gorenaire lifts back leg and pees over corpse pile*

Gorenaire: "U R GAY"

*Gorenaire azzrapes Jazz's warm corpse*

Gorenaire: "Bwhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"
