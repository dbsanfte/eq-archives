Level 3 is the max.  I only have level 1 on my warrior, and he's currently
retired, so I can't really comment on how effective level 3 is.

You don't get any kind of special message when it activates.  It reads just
like you scored a normal hit.   So... if it succeds, you do not take the
riposte damage.

As I said, I can't say how good level 3 is, but my gut feeling is that it
will not be all that effective.  Even if it gets you up to the point where
half of your hits land on enrage, and half are ripsoted...  against a raid
level mob, you're still more than doubling thier already high damage output.
Each of those extra blows are still landing for 1000 to 3000 extra damage.

Better to turn off attack and pray that you don't lose aggro, than to keep
attacking and pray the clerics can keep you up against the suddenly much
higher damage you're taking.


In an experience group, theres no way the extra damage output would be worth
blowing the healer's mana like that.
