Except that EQ is not real life and the model is different.  In Rl the
Trickle down theory proposes that giving cash back to the wealthiest
will allow them to use it in investments that will promote jobs for us

the poor plebs would be better.  Entirely debatable and of no
relationship to the idea of hand me down indestructible items in a
game.
