    The carryover to items has always been in place. I think I mentioned
here once that those 90 point heal pods that drop in the caller quest in
Fungus Grove do 107 when I use them - 10 points is losing the 10% healing
penalty, 5 points from the 5% healing bonus for being a cleric,  2 points
from my 2% AA ability. It would be interesting if, in fact, the healing
"penalty" was applied to every class but cleric.

    No, being able to heal an extra 80-90 points with Nature's Touch is just
as useless at level 60 as the three points is to your ranger. Clerics have
the ability to raise all our instant heals up to 10% or so with AA
abilities, and the consensus is that the ability is useless even for fast
heals like Remedy and Divine Light. You'll go an awful long time before
saving someone with that 10%. Healing crits, on the other hand, are life
savers - when you crit, you generally save someone as their health goes out
of low health aggro range and you buy yourself enough time to be able to
chain-cast better heal per second heals like Divine Light or even a CH, as
opposed to chaining Remedy.
