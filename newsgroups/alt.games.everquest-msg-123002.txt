http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm has bold, italicized text at
the top that reads as follows: "Unless otherwise noted, all baked goods have a
weight of 0.1."

People have already mentioned Fish Rolls. These weigh 0.1 each, are a
banquet-sized meal and trivial at 135. Recipe is one batwing plus one Fresh
Fish. Both are available on vendors in Norrath.

I have seen batwings as a regular-stock item on a vendor somewhere in Cabilis,
but I don't remember which vendor or which side, sorry. Batwings are also sold
in the Bazaar and several other places (where you're probably KOS).  I haven't
seen Fresh Fish on any vendor in or around Cabilis; presumably, Verant wants
Iksar to fish for them.

Fresh Fish are sold in Felwithe by Fishmonger Issa, so you could ride to the
GFay spires and pay some impoverished elf to fetch some for you. You might even
get to scare the crap out of a real newbie who's never seen a Leezard before.
