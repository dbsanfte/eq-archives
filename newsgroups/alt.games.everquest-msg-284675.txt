Oops.  Got my abbreviations mixed up.  I meant Dark Elf.
Her name is Giz Dinree.  The quest begins in Neriak 3rd quarter -- called 
"rogue take".  Anyway, I had no problem finding her.  What I couldnt find 
was the chest in the harbor and the school of sharks nearby that was 
supposed to clue me in that I was close.

Also, I got another quest from the same DE lady and she asked me to go to 
the Seafarers Roost and kill Lyda Nasin.  This quest is called Death of Lyda 
Nasin.  Lyda wasnt in the Seafarers Roost though.  By info from Allakhazam 
she spawns on the 2nd floor, but the Roost no longer has a 2nd floor.  I 
hung around for awhile and never saw her.  Anyone seen Lyda since revamp?
