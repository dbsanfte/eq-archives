I used to use da that way but have changed to considering it my own
version of evade. With 2 up using up one to drop agro way before low
health is an issue is much more efficient, IMO, and stops the mob from
making a beeline for you as soon as it drops. Only in places like Plane
of Valor, where a stun can put you out of commision long enough to get
low health before getting off a da do I move far enough away to make
sure I can get a remedy off before the mob can reach me.
