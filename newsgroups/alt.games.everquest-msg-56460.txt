Which is why I saw a Graveyard Knight standing there, targetted him
(he's full HP), ran up, hit him with Expulse Undead (opening shot),
and he dropped dead.  Gee, he was standing still, wasn't fighting
anybody, and his HP bar was full.  So why'd he drop dead?  And why
couldn't I loot him?  Couldn't possibly be that he was actually
engaged with someone.

On the other side, I saw a ghoul fighting.  Obviously, it's fighting
someone.  I ran up.  Couldn't see them.  Ran around the fight,
couldn't see them.  Ran right up into contact with the ghoul.
Couldn't see them.  Finally, the ghoul dropped dead.  Pop, there's the
other character.
