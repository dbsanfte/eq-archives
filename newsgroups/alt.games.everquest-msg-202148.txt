So, after much research and consideration, I had it all figured out.
Each component for my new computer was selected, and I was ready to
start buying. I had decided on a GeForce TI 4200, and felt good about
that decision. But now I'm hearing a lot of hype about the new GeForce
FX series... and need help. I've looked around on Tom's Hardware, but
most of what's there is a little over my head, technically speaking. So
what should I get? Money isn't a big concern. I'm more worried about
DirectX 9 compatibility and long-term usefulness (knowing myself, I
won't likely be upgrading much until absolutely necessary). Any
thoughts?

Thanks in advance.
