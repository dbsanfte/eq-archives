That's correct as far as it goes, but I'm afraid Jaorr_Blade will
be disappointed with the results.  The problem is that tells from
players look the same as responses from NPCs, aside from the name
of the speaker, so anything that matches all PCs will also match
all NPCs, and you'll hear the sound in response to

    Banker Denton tells you, 'Welcome to my bank!'
or
    Merchant Tekrama tells you, 'That'll be 1 silver per Water Flask.'

This is why I still don't have an audio trigger for tells, even though
I agree it would be really nice to have.  The best I can suggest is to
create a separate chat window for tells, or at least for low-volume
stuff (i.e. not battle spam, /ooc, etc.), and/or assign it a distinctive
text color.

p.s.: Though not a tell, one pattern that DOES work is 'Hail, Yourname'.
I have triggers set up for that as well as for: invites you to join a
group.  Those two triggers help me appear much more attentive than I
really am! :-)
