Hi


The Boat for Ovethere leaves from Oasis , Your best bet would be as
follows  But you should a Bind in Freeport

1)

  Use Druid ring  to transport  to WC 

2)

 Go  East to EC

3)

  Go to Freeport get Bind 

OR

  Take the tunnel in EC and go to NRo
The tunnel is near the hills on the South side 



4) 

Go to Oasis 

5)

Take the raft at the  dock in Oasis

6 )

Go to Island halfway to Overthere  then transfert to the Boat  (  sort
of a Boat )  It  will arrived on the other side of the Island at the
fishing village ,  the dock near the sunken ship 

7)

When arriving at Overthere you must jump from the ship and swim to
shore since all the good guys are  KOS  at the port in Overthere 



 If you need info just ask at Oasis or during the trip to Overthere 
I would recommend you get Maps from EQAtlas  there are some locations
that are more dangerous then others .


Beast level in Overthere -- from 15 to 40 


That is the way I see it 


Luck
