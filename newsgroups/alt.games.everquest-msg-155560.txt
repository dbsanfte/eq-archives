I have a clock. I forget to look at it.  I suppose I could go out and
buy myself a new alarm clock, but seeing as I already have to go out
and buy a new one for my bedroom tomorrow, and I'm barely eking out
enough to pay for EQ atm (and hey, without EQ, I wouldn't need a
reminder ;p) and have an over the limit credit card bill and a
mother's birthday gift to buy still... *shrug* not complaining, just
pointing out why that won't be happening.  Besides, I didn't whine at
them to put an alarm in, never even thought about an alarm right in EQ
itself.  I never would have thought of it, but since it's in there,
why the heck not do it some useful way?
