Don't. The road is no less long (it has always been infinite, after
all).

Look at it this way, new content is being added at the highest end of
the game. It used to be that you could start a character, and a few
months to 2 years (depending on how often you played and who you knew)
you could get to level 60, and you were considered "ready to start"
the high-end game.

Now that bar has been raised. Unless you are 65 and have 100AA, you're
not ready to start the high-end game. So what Sony is doing is raising
the range a bit. In the early days 1-9 were the "intro levels" and
10-20 were where you started to be a part of EQ. Now 1-19 are the
"intro levels" and 20-40 are where you start to get into the real
content (LDON really made that a reality... I'm still stunned to log
in my level 32 bard and actually get a group quickly).

Meanwhile those of us who are in AA-land are looking at the people who
are leveling up through the 50s somewhat the same way we were looked
at when we were in the hell levels of 35 and 40 (we all remember hell
levels, right?)

I think this is the right move for Sony to make. If they did not do
this, EQ would slowly die as the attrition rate failed to be matched
by the retention rate for new players.

Today, character growth takes on many shades, and "leveling" is not
the only way you grow. You can get to level 65. You can get tons of
AA. There are trade skills to max out (at huge cost in time and
materials). Planar flagging is another area. Adventure points even
have a leader-board!

So there are at least 13 areas I can think of (5 trades + levels + AA
+ flags + 5 themes in LDON) that your character can progress in. If
the game didn't "jump start" a little, why would new players come in
now?
