   And when you call for help, it might help to be specific.  I was at
the bank waiting for Lenny when someone fell in.  Unfortunately, I had
no means to help them.  They /shouted "Help!  I'm going to drown in
here!" for about ten minutes.  Finally someone showed up and cast a
spell on them.  I have to admit, I laughed when they said "I don't need
enduring breath, I need OUT!"
