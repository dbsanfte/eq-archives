I got a chance to root/dot in tandem with a bard once. She pulled, I
snared and rooted, she sang dot songs, I cast mine. Worked like a
charm. I also tried it on another occasion with another bard - he'd
sing a DD song at first (higher level Denon's), which broke root more
often than we liked, but as soon as he stuck with dot songs, we were
rolling.
