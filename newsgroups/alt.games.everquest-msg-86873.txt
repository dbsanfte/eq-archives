I usually keep myself bound at the Nexus, as all I can do is Gate.  It's
damned convenient to gate up there, and have to wait no more than 15 minutes
to get to whatever continent I want to be at when I can't find a port.  It
also makes getting up to the moon quite a bit easier, and I've been spending
a lot of time up there lately.
