A 53 cleric couldn't land her single target ac/hp buff on my 39
warrior, don't think she could at 40 either. I think their single
target version is lvl 51? 

This does leave you with the screwed up situation where it's possible
to group with someone for exp but you can't buff them with your group
buffs. That one is gonna be annoying.
