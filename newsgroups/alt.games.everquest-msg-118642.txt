I thought I had already demonstrated that the morality of what humans do 
cannot be measured by whether animals do the same or not. Obviously, "might 
makes right" is the rule all animals live by, but it's traditionally 
expected that humans set higher standards for themselves.

Anyway, obviously, you aren't a vegetarian, and no reason I could possibly 
give would be substantial enough for you (more so when "winning" an 
argument is at stake). The reasons I've given you have been substantial 
enough to keep *me* (and several million others, of course) from eating 
meat since 1989, which at the end of the day is what matters to me.
