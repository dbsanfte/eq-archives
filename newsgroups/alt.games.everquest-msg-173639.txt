Thanks, Jazz... I've in fact tried The Grey already (for long enough to 
get my Amulet of the Grey Wastes... I wish someone would buy now my 
Fishbone Earring >:( ), and I have to say it tests even my pretty high 
boredom threshold. Perhaps I should try moving away from the ML zoneline 
and exploring a little, but the business of pulling Timeless Golems 
seemed to be turning my brain into so much grey vacuum too. :)

Still, I have TG as one zone on my list to grind AA in, alongside 
Burning Wood and JPF (only the anacondas are blue to me, but I can move 
from one to the next pretty briskly).
