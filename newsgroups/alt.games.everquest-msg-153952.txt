Yet somehow I imagine you think your cable bill is just fine.

You obviously have no idea what amount of data gets transferred.

Here's a tidbit- evry 30 seconds ( i think) you get a global update, while 
every tick you get a near-you update. This update includes things like 
health left on you, every mob in the zone, etc, as well as position (on 
three axis) And tons of other data.

By contrast, d2 has MUCH smaller zones, fewer of them, and less data per 
mob (as well as less players per zone).

Oh yeah, and Blizzard loses their ass on Battle.net

That's kind of funny. I run a medium sized ISP and I will tell you that we 
use a FRACTION of EQs bandwidth. And we pay many many thousands per month 
for it.

Again, you have no fucking clue what you are talking about and are spouting 
off for no apparent reason.

No, I will not "remember" something you made up entirely. Nor will I treat 
your baseless assumptions as fact.

You get what you pay for. Yes, they do make money. Good. That means they 
will be around next week. If you don't like it, go to D2 and use your 
allowance on buying used Playboys from the kid up the street.
