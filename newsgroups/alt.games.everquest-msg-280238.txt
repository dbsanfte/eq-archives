Like I said elsewhere, I prefer money leaving my accounts to be less 
convenient. One of my many billing issues with SOE involved clicking on 
the Order Now button for an expansion, expecting to be taken to an 
information or confirmation screen... only to get a "Thank you, you card 
has been billed"... Little "too" convenient for my taste that a single 
click on a screen I have to click-through every time I login can cost me 
30 bucks.

FWIW I know a number of people who do just that. When they get blocked 
from playing they decide if they want to continue and set it up again. 
It works well. Because they're casual players they rarely try and login 
the day it expires... I figure easily have access whenever they want 
worst case having an extra 5 minute hoop once every month-ish, and 
probably only pay for 10-11 months of access. :)

Under these circumstances I tend to agree with you, which is why I'm not 
making a big stink about it, except here and mostly hypothetically, but 
echoing the arguments and sentiments of others more dedicated to the 
cause. For what its worth, however, these circumstances are enough like 
other less acceptable ones that in SOE's case at least I think its fair 
to err on the side of caution, or be irate about it in general.

I'm not insisting on it. They could have eaten the loss. They could have 
gotten it right in the first place.

When a burger joint drops a raw patty on the floor its cheaper to flip 
it back onto the grill than to flip it into the waste bucket. In all 
honesty the odds of anyone being harmed by such a recovered burger are 
vanishingly small. I still find it a highly distateful policy though, 
and would likely refuse to eat there.

Of course.

You seem to have lost track of -why- were supposing this:

The point of this excercise was that SOE would find some other way of 
helping themselves to the money you owe them as a "convenience" to you.

Without asking permission first. Its all about the permission, not about 
the total, not about the number of transactions. Legally, we have an 
agreement in place that allows them to do this, but its still extremely 
rude to unilaterally do this to fix an error THEY made.

If I agree to lend you my cottage for 5 days in exchange for the use of 
your boat on the long weekend and you only spend 3 days up there due to 
a scheduling error you made, that's fine. I'll surely let you have it 
for another weekend too... but I'd be right pissed if you just showed up 
at the door with your bags a month later to collect on the debt. 

If you then tell me you didn't bother phoning ahead to ask in order to 
save on your cellular bill... er as a convenience to me, by not 
bothering me with it...well that would hardly be satisfactory.  ;)
