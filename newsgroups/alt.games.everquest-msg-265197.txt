Not that I can suggest anywhere offering delivery in the UK before the
12th, but you might like to check out http://www.gameplay.co.uk/. They
are just as cheap as anywhere else on the web and they are still
offering the pre-order disk free; so you can create your character
ready for the live game. It also includes a pre-order in-game gift of
a pair of Journeyman's Boots so you can run away quicker :). It's nice
to see a UK company actually offering these pre-release disks which
are only usually, annoyingly, offered to North American consumers.

DVDBoxoffice.com are also shipping the *Deluxe* box to the UK if you
really want to shell out for the fan stuff.
