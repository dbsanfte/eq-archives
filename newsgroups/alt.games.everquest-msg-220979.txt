    In general, you don't know when a target was last killed. Works for
maybe one spawn cycle after a patch day, then you just lose track because
you're hitting other targets. Was the mob ganked overnight by the local
Asian guild that doesn't talk with anyone else? Was it killed by a rival
guild? If it's a smaller target, was it killed by a group of six people from
the local uberguild that wanted stuff for their twinks? Add in the spawn
time randomizer on many mobs from Velious on, and it ends up easier to check
if the mob is there rather than do the legwork to know when it could pop and
watch that spot for the entire 12 hour pop window.

    I imagine a good, well-geared wizard could do one man PBAE kiting or
quadding, but Joe Average isn't going to be able to brute-force panthers.
Especially not with the adds that are floating around the area, on two
opposed factions. Panthers themselves are about the same level as, and hit
as hard as, griffins, with more HPs. They are one of the lowest level mobs
in the zone.

    Knowing they're due, and them being there, are two different things. Say
you want to bag King Tormax. You know when last he died. The twelve hour
spawn window for his next respawn includes time when the local Asian guild
will have force to gank him. Do you:

(a) Get some fool without a life to sit there from the moment Tormax could
spawn onwards;
(b) Arrive in force as soon as possible and sit there, hoping he didn't
spawn earlier and get ganked by the Asians;
(c) Send out trackers to find out what IS up, go kill one of those things,
send out the trackers again, etc, trying to focus on tracking in zones where
you know things could be due?

    If you absolutely NEED to kill him, you'll do (a) and (b). If you want
to actually have fun that day, though, and hit a maximum number of targets,
you'll do (c).

    There are now non-trackable nameds in The Hole. Programming error or
intentional, some of the important nameds can no longer be tracked. I've
noticed that people who'd normally do epics in the zone aren't going until
after next patch. Why? Nobody wants to blow through a bunch of trash mobs
for no reason. My guild calls them "Pottz raids", after an old guild officer
who once lead a Trakanon raid when Trak wasn't up.

    If ever you want to find out about all the content in EQ, lead a raid on
something that isn't up. As soon as people find out it's a Pottz raid,
they'll tell you in great detail all the things they could have been doing
instead of wasting their time clearing junk to an empty room. It's not about
laziness; it's about optimal use of time.
