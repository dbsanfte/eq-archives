Bingo.

I do the same thing a lot.  I simply don't have the time to waste
trying to squeeze another <some number of pp> out of a sale,
I'm just glad to get rid of it, get it to someone who can
use it, make some room in my crowded bank, *and* make at
least *some* cash on it.

It beats selling it to a vendor for 12sp, or just destroying it
to make room.  I hate wasting things that some player might
find useful.

So when I'm auctioning to unload stuff, and someone asks me
how much it is, I'll just say, "I'm easy, make an offer", and
take almost any offer that isn't a complete insult, even if
it's 1/10th of the "standard" price.
