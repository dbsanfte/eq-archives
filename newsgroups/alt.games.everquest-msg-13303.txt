I think you overreacted.  The correct answer is "thank you."

Yup, they messed you up.  They didn't get you killed, but they did mess you
up.  Whining at them is likely to get them thinking "fuck this, everyone is
so unappreciative anymore...I'm not going to help ANYONE who looks in fear
for their lives."

So a month later you post a gripe saying that some damned druid watched you
die and didn't lift a finger to help.  Ok, maybe you don't post it, but you
sure do THINK it.

You can't have it both ways.  Consider the thought, not the action.

(and yes, I whine too, though not at the person helping me...I think most
people whine on occasion, so that's obviously not a flame)
