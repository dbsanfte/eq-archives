The words "solo" and "cleric" don't really belong in the same sentence,
unless that sentence also includes, "absolutely cannot".  Clerics are
terrible soloers; their DPS is pathetic, they don't get good benefit from
their AC, and without KEI you'll go OOM very quickly, causing yourself some
downtime.  You'll get *much* better XP from a group.

That having been said, clerics can, in fact, solo.  Some places to try:

Undead froggies in LGuk.  Stick close to the zone-in so you can run.  Get
your stuns up for use against the casters - and avoid the casters if you
can.  Use Pacify (if you have it, might be a level 39 spell, otherwise use
Calm) to single-pull mobs.  Root is essential, so that you can root the mob,
back off, cast a heal, then wade back in.  The danger, of course, is that
you yourself will get rooted - *all* the mobs proc a root - so be sure to
have Divine Aura memorized for those emergencies.

As you get towards 40, another great solo spot is the Combine spires in the
Dreadlands.  There's a pyramid where a few skeletons wander around inside.
The best thing about these is that you can just nuke one and it will come
single - they're not social.  Another nice thing is that, in this part of
the Dreadlands, there are no wandering mobs, so you could just fear kite -
pull the mob, fear it, and keep nuking it as it runs away, or just keep
hitting it from behind.  Getting SoW will help a lot with this.

Using those methods, you *can* solo.  Just don't expect the XP to flow
quickly.  It will take you a long time to kill a mob, and until you hit 45
and can have KEI cast on you, downtime is going to be significant.

Best, though, is to try and find a group of competent people and just XP
with them.  Find out who the good ones are in your pickup groups and send
them tells asking if they wanna join a private group next time.  Good groups
are built around clerics; if you can develop a list of good players to group
with, you'll find that they will be eager to group with you in return.  And
the XP will just flow like water.

Good luck.  =)  The sub-50 world today is *so* different from when Monual
was leveling up.  I'm just amazed at the stuff Marrtuk can solo that took a
good group to do in Monual's day.  Maybe you'll find things easier, too.
