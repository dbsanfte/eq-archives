Cats in Hats is currently on the Drinal server.  Some of them aren't too bad
to talk to, though they play EQ entirely too much.  6 hours of raid time, 5
days a week.  And members are expected to work on AA points outside of
raiding time. :)  Go check out their joining requirements.  Insane - who has
time for a 2nd job that doesn't pay?
