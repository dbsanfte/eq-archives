First thing you need to do is get an Experienced Monk preferably or an
Experienced SK as puller. He must know the zone well for a Bad pull means 2
hours of res duty. For Hate I would recommend making 2 very Strong melee
Groups with Healers to go in first and hold the port in area till everyone
is in then regroup to balance once inside. If you can port in 2 groups at a
time. have a predetermined Hate channel set. Have your puller and tagger in
the same group for easier communications. Have fun, expect to die, and don't
expect any exp. Planes raids go bust quite often, and 1 or 2 groups seem to
get all the exp. Final tip if you can not gate or TP have a gate potion of
some sort with you if by chance you go LD and can't get back on the Planes
are a nasty place to be alone with no way out.
