Bought a horse today.  Yep, YV doesn't stack with it, so its FAR less
useful to a cleric than to any other class.  But anyway, I did find one
pleasant surprise, it fits in my heretofore useless AMMO slot!

On the down side, its one more thing clogging up my buff slots, already at
a premium for raids... remember, I have to have room for SE, CHeal off BP,
and at least two DOTS from the bad guys, on top of POTG, Symbol, Focus,
Stamina buff, a couple bard songs, and whatever resists we are using...
along with a crap buff and in slot one, my insta-click buff!
