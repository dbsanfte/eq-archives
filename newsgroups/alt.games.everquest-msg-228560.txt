Healing pets doesn't generate hate anyway.

Besides, in situations where this is actually useful you're just going
to let him die then pop the 2nd one you have suspended.

If I had the spell (I don't yet) I'd buff a pet with it (and BOV and
a couple others) suspend it, then bring up another pet and do the
same.  Now I have enough pet survivability to make it through 
shorter fights without wasting mana on heals.
