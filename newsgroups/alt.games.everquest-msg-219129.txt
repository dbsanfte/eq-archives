That pretty much limits you to someone that can heal like mad or can tank
better then a rogue then. Druid, shaman, cleric or Paladin, SK. SK's have
life tap type spells that let them heal after a fashion.

I've tanked using my ranger with rogues and it was pretty weak. Some rogues
never use backstab in fear of drawing aggro which kind of makes them tits on
a bull. I've teamed with other rogues that had poor equipment and
backstabbed like mad to soon which was just as bad. Point is, if you run the
rogue well you may be able to get away teaming with a ranger.

The pet classes would be ok too. Necro is probably the strongest for dungeon
work. The pets are good for chasing runners and 3 on 1 is better then 2 on
1.
