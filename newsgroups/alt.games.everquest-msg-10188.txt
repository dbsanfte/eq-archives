I was healer to a group with two paladins once. It didn't save me from
getting killed :) (Of course, they might have used LOH already, but we
never knew. I like grouping with monks when they inform me of mend
status and ANY tank who doesn't have to be reminded to tell me when
buffs like regen drop - casting them all on myself for a timer isn't
always mana sensible)

>though i have met some great paladins too.

Ditto.
