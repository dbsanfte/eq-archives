Thank you very much Richard.

And yes I'm using it through the Com port.

Just to take things further......

In raid situations particulary I'm setting all models OFF, everything set on
minimum or off in the OPTIONS section including sound etc

In game:  Spelleffects off, showgrassfilter off, serverfilter off, clip
plane Min (I might be getting some of these names wrong but I'm sure you get
the jist) .. Though lately I've had them on to see the new effects etc and
when I went to Thurg today with particle density options on high and WOAH
theres a waterfall at the entrance to Thurg ! hehe.. was always just a blank
wall with a trace of outline where the door was!. Can't wait untill I get a
new system :)

Are there any other things I can do to improve FPS? or have I covered them
all ?

Once again, any advice greatly appreciated :)

Cheers

Kev
