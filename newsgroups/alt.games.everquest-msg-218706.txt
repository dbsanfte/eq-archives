Its a decent enough solo class prior to 34, but it does improve
dramatically with the addition of the pet.  As you level further,
the pet goes up in damage output much faster than shaman melee
does, so you have to adjust.

Stoicism is level 44, not 49, and you'll also have Canni II by
then if you can arrange some help getting it.
