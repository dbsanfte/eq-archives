If you're lower than me (i'm 17), not too twinked, you ask me directly and
I'm not doing anything (like fighting or tradeskills), a SOW is free and
I'll cancel a trade.  Higher or very twinked, I won't cancel a trade but I
won't require anything. I don't SOW shouting people.  If I'm busy, I say so.
Non-naggers will get a SOW when I'm finished. People who nag me get nada.

I always bind for free regardless of level or twinkage.  That's the only
thing I really disagree with in Verant's *VISION*.  You MUST travel to do
quests or find groups, etc but that means that non-casters MUST beg for a
bind.  Maybe it's begging a guildie or friend but it's still begging.  I
think everyone should be able to bind but only in city areas or get rid of
the bind concept.  I'm not sure how it would work without binding as far as
dieing, gating, etc.

Wow, I have soapbox.  Cool.
