You can make that 2.

I see people shout "group needs shaman" a lot, I never see "group need
druid"

Well, besides in /gu when some people want to go to Ldogs in Velks. (for the
uninitiated, the only way out of Ldogs without a port involves going through
the entire honeycomb area under the castle, avoiding Doljonijiarnimorinar
and the dispel trap, then popping out near Velketor, and running like hell
past his room, thus it's easier to just die somewhere and get summoned to
zone in and rezzed than to actually walk out of Ldogs)
