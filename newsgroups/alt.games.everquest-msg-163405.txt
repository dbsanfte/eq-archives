The arrival of the quest to get the Ghoulbane.

Now, if they'd just de-paladin the so-called paladins who killed the Shin
Lord for it, I'd be a truly happy player

Making 'ports easier and easier to get (and not fixing the bloody boats).
It's extremely annoying to run into people who have literally no idea how to
get from W Commons to N Karana other than "port plz".

(I ran into someone who was stuck in Overthere for 3 WEEKS because he didn't
know how to get onto the boat, switch to the raft, and get to Oasis.  He'd
lost 3 levels {Level 18 with a surname} and all his equipment from being
unable to get to various corpses.)
