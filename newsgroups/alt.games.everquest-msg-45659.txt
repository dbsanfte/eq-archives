They -were- installed right.  Interestingly enough, -uninstalling- the
ALi Northbridge driver totally fixed the problem.  Was using version
1.80 from this page.

http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/drivers/north_agp_driver.htm

Now I'm using the generic Win98SE flavor.  It identified it (after the
driver was removed) as "PCI standard PCI-to-PCI bridge".  I think
before in Device Manager it came up more or less the same only with a
newer date and path to the ALi drivers.

Guess I won't be bashing this motherboard to bits.  I would however
like to know why ALi's stuff didn't work.  I'm probably taking a
performance hit.
