It's kind of the same reason any similar words have different meanings.
Thats just the way people see language.  There may be deeper socialogical
reasons, or maybe it's just the way it is.  Language develops meaning and
then the meaning is.

Can you see that there is a need (occasionally) for rude language?  These
words fulfil that need.  I frankly don't understand why that is so
difficult.  If these words eventually (through overuse) become commonplace
then someone will have to create new words to offend.
