OK, I think my speculation on you having ~some kind of learning disorder has
just been shown. Sorry about that, took me awhile to realize it. I don't
need a pound of flesh out of you let alone a retraction  under the
circumstances.

For your benefit, I am reproducing my post to this thread that ticked Lokari
off. You will notice that the post was neither directed at Lokari or
mentions her. Read it 5 or 6 times so you can grasp this. Read it another 5
or 6 times until you see that not only does it not reference Lokari, but it
does not even say anything that even remotely resembles the statements you
attribute to me.

IMHO: Just means the programmers are kind of immature and elitist as in "I
don't have to follow the rules" and they snuck a few in. This is pretty
consistant with my experiences with programmers.

There are two levels of administration going on here, the programming crew
and the game administration. All this means is if some of the programmers
were admin'n the game, names like Harry Cock would be perfectly acceptible
to them. This should come as no surprise to anyone.

But the programmers aren't game admins.
