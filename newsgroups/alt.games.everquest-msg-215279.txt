The improvement moving to Selos Drums of the March was even smaller than that,
when I did it that was the best drum on the market, I spent about 7Kpp on that
drum (having previously seen it, rarely, at 10K, thought it was a bargain).  And
to me, no, the jump in damage wasn't worth the 14 fold increase in cost; DOT
damage isn't really the way I do most of my killing anyway, its just for
finishing off mobs at the end of a charm kite or swaying the odds during one.

I twist all 5 chants if resists aren't an issue, although this means drops due
to lag so I really only have 4 and a half DOTs worth of effect, still, thats
half again your three twist, and for no cash expenditure at all.  On the other
hand, it would also mean your drum upgrade would be worth more like 32 damage
per tic.  It would still be just a 12% jump in effect though.

Llyric

Oh, I say "if resists aren't an issue", because the chants themselves have  a
debuff to that resist, so if I am getting resists then its better to twist fewer
songs so they don't drop out before being reapplied; this way when they get
reapplied the resist they are trying to get thru is lower.  A better drum would
help here too, the resists are lowered by more as well as the damage being
higher, so that would make keeping the DOTs on the mob easier.
