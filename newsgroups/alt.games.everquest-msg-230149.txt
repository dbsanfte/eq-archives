Hmm, thats an interesting approach, also known as "ignoring a problem 
makes it better".

But, lets just say you deliberately work on all 5 weapon skills every 
level.  What happens?

Well, first, it means you have to get 5 weapons.  Some cash outlay, some 
weight, and a little time spent there.

Consider the weapons you get.  Well, you want something Good of course, 
the "mortgage the castle" type weapon, as your primary main weapon.  And 
you want your best possible secondary weapon, if your main weapon is a 
one hander.  But the other three (four if your main is a two hander) 
weapons don't have to be much, really, since you won't be using them all 
that much.  Something fast, damage, stats, procs unimportant, for each 
category, and honestly no need to be all -that- fast, once fast starts 
to get expensive.

Since the main and secondary (if any) weapon would be things you'd want 
to plunk tons of cash/effort into anyway, they aren't important to this 
discussion; its just the "skillup" weapons you have to worry about.  So, 
so much for cash and time; minimal worry.

Second, it costs you DPS.  Assuming, of course, you followed my advice 
and didn't spend a lot on your "misc weaponry" kit, that is, naturally 
when you remove your main weapon your damage output suffers.

Assuming you are using a one hander as your Main weapon, and another one 
hander in another type as your secondary slot one hander, that leaves 
only one type of weapon to work on as alternate one hander; swap that in 
as secondary when you are doing easy fights and it really won't cost you 
all that much DPS, particularly not at low levels while dual weild and 
double attack aren't high yet.  And at high levels, DWDA means that 
secondary weapon skill ups happen pretty fast, so it won't cost you for 
long.

That leaves the two two handers.  Well, as a ranger, you -should- have 
two weapons sets; one fast pair, one big hard hitting slow two hander 
for mobs with DS or Riposte, or in situations where your MT is having 
trouble keeping aggro off you.  So whatever you spend on One of the 
above is money well spent anyway.  The other one, well thats another 
story.  But if the "other" one is 2hb, well there's a very fast, though 
pathetic, 2hb item you can pick up free off the ground to train that 
skill up, and it will go up pretty fast with that thing.  Use it on 
relatively trivial mobs with the indulgence of your group mates and 
you'll catch up the 5 points pretty fast.

Another option is to go fear kite a while each level, and when the mob 
gets low enough that it will be running on its own, switch in your poor 
weapon, beat ineffectively on the back for a long time (here's where a 
poor damage weapon is actually to your benefit, it keeps the mob alive 
longer)

You are only looking for Two skills, a one hander, and a two hander, 
that aren't in use on a pretty much constant basis.  10 points per 
level.  It doesn't take all -that- long.  And you are only buying One 
weapon thats used only for skill up purposes (the shovel was free remember?)

What happens if you -don't- do this?  Well, eventually you are going to 
see a piercing weapon or 2 hand blunt weapon or -something- you didn't 
have anything worthwhile in, thats better than anything you currently 
own.  Just the way things go, your next upgrade weapon can always be in 
any of the 5 categories, and if you neglected two of the skills, thats a 
2/5ths chance per item that what you see is not something you know how 
to use.

So, blow off the item, thats throwing away 2/5ths the drops out there. 
Or take the item, as you suggest, even though you have no skill in it. 
Then suffer thru not 5 points, but 200 points.  And have the damage not 
suck a bit, as a relatively poor weapon with a skill a few points under 
cap might, but a Lot, as you miss miss miss due to your very low attack 
skill.

Its not insrumountable, but it is a pain, and its inevitable, you'll end 
up working on all the skills anyway in the long run, might as well do it 
relatively painlessly.

Splendid
