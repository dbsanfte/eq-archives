Exactly!

However, it's all really simple once you've thought it all out.  I've never
given a single thought to what haste really is because I haven't exactly had
a smorgasbord of haste items to select from.  If you find yourself learning
something new, and then run across an article like that, it's more than a
little confusing.  Now that I know how inaccurate and misleading the article
is, you're right, it is really simple.
