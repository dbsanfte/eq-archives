The best healing "potions" are the Bandages.  Buy many stacks,
and apply them using the Bind Wound ability when needed.

They won't heal much at first, but as you continue to use them,
your Bind Wound skill will increase.  Eventually you'll be
able to heal 50 HP per bandage when your skill hits 200.

The only catch is that you'll only be able to bind your wounds
up to 50% of your max hitpoints (70% after your skill hits 201
or more).
