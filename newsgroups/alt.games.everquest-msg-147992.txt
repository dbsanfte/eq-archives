If I recall it wasn't that the idea that >level cap was introduced
that would be goofy, it's how that new batch of 130 AA level 65
folks would affect old world content (Mage with epic pet AND
new Fire Lord pet solos Trakanon!!!).  If they make the level
changes only effective in the PoP places, then that's basically
a no-effect change.  Heck, I'm happy with it.  What I don't want
to see is Severilous die to a single ranger :-).  The Lewt Godz
would not be amused...
