Yeah. I can see it too :). But I still maintain that its not about 
open-minded or close-minded. You *could* blithely beleive everything you 
hear from anybody (that would require you not to be close-minded I 
think) but you'd still be going on pure faith for your belief system. 
(And a bleeding idiot to boot)

I think you've made a valid point that I shouldn't have said 'faith' 
like that in a vaccuum of context. Someone else used the phrase 'blind 
faith' to differentiate examined faith from unexamined faith; if I amend 
to that would it resolve the objection?
