Kaev tried camping the Shin Lord once.  Fortunately we had to evac
fairly early in the camp, so it only too about 150 or so kills in
LGuk to expiate his guilt.  End the end he bought a Ghoulbane.  I
had/have a Paladin on Lanys who never killed a live Frog, he did
the quest (and if Lanys had been a PvP server I would've organized
a swat team to mercilessly slaughter and corpse camp the goddamned
dr00ds who were forever camping the Crazed in BBM.  Pathetic twits).
