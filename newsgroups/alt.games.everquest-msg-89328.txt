    There's a SK epic quest NPC or two on True Spirit faction in Paineel.
There's also some evidence that there's two Heretics factions in Paineel -
kill the named Erudite prisoner in the Warrens to see what I mean - but I
haven't heard of anyone specifically figuring out what area of town is on
the second Heretics.
