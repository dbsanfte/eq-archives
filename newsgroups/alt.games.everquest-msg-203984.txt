There are few Role Players on EQ and I would imagine the same can be said
for most MMORPG's.
Many of those that start out possibly thinking of it as an RPG, with an
appropiate name and outlook, are soon jaded (if that's the word) and make
alt's with supposedly witty names like "Punchyournose Untilitbleeds" then
start treating the game as any other PC game, to be beaten rather than
played.
Some just come along with the Quake attitude already "this Roleplay shit is
so Ghey" got to get to end game ASAP and "pwn" it.
There is little use of RP in the end game, it becomes more about team work
and numbers.

EQ has an RP server, Firiona Vie...this has some different rules to
others...
You speak only your own language to start...you have to learn to speak
others. Strangely Elvish, not Human, is the language of choice.
TLC is in effect on all zones (Trivial Loot Code, was tested on all servers
in one zone alone but the farmers didn't like it so was dropped) To get
magic or quest loot you need to be the appropriate level...ie. Get exp from
the Mob that drops it. This is also used on ALL DAoC servers.
There is no No Drop tag on any items (well...pretty much any items)
everything can be sold
Only one Character per Account...makes for a few re "rolls" before sticking
to one. Also makes for less twinking than normal...It still happens tho.
The server has no /ooc (Out Of Character chat) all chat across a zone is
meant to be in character.
Oh and it's a very empty server compared to others :�)
People are more likely to RP here but the dumb names are still in there in
numbers and a lot of ppls idea of RP is to use the word Season rather than
Level when shouting for a group.

SWG is meant to be released with the idea that all servers are RP
servers...I doubt that will hold out....Maybe they can make a couple of Non
RP servers and see what happens :�)
No idea on EQ2 but given there is less linear Level and Class distinction in
the game I do have some hope for it...

As others have said, RP and many ppl will try and do the same in return. I
think a lot of the lack of RP in EQ is embarressment and the fact few others
do it, especially older and more experienced players...But..You never know
what you might start...There is also and 100 capacity /ignore list for
morons if your RP is met with a "l33t" response.
