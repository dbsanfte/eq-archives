Hey everyone. As you may have noticed, I've just recently returned from a 
few month's hiatus. Still playing SWG a bit, but it could really use some 
content developers...but I digress.

Anyhoo, I'm not up to speed on any class changes that have occurred 
since, say, the LoY expansion. Actually, I didn't play long enough after 
that to see much of what it had to offer at all. Bottom line is I'm 
itching to roll up an new character on a new server. Does anyone have any 
insight on the following servers:

Maelyn Starpyre
Tholuxe Paells
Saryrn (have some char's. there, but been a *loooong* time since I played 
them)
Stromm (has the lowbie madness passed)
...or other more mature servers? I mentioned the first two above because 
they appear to be among the newer ones. Maybe newer may not necessarily 
be better? I have a 44 bard on Firiona Vie that I just got a bit burnt 
out on. I really like that server, but I don't want to scrap him to 
create another character.

I'm pretty familiar with most classes, so in that regard I'd just 
appreciate your own experiences with them as they relate to soloing and 
group desirability. Like many, I would like to play a class desired by 
groups but at least somewhat solo-capable for when grouping just isn't 
working out. In spite of that, I've seriously considered a warrior. 
Though I don't like that common perception that they aren't the best 
option for MA until raid levels and I'm not real keen on being completely 
devoid of magical ability.

I guess I'm just sorta fishing for ideas from the perspectives of others.

Thanks.
