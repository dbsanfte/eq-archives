Because they are used in many quests.

The vendors are out of line, though.  There needs to be some rethinking in
regards to the vendor/player driven economy.  It makes no sense for a
crafted item to sell for less than the components (2 spider silks sold to a
vendor 2.8 silver, 1 silk thread sold for 2.2sp).  Things like that make me
wonder who was making these prices up.
