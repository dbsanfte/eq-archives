Its entirely possible that we agree here.

Happens with my wife a lot, we could both swear we were arguing.
Wish I could just scroll up on some of those conversations!

For a cleric, BAOR blows POTG out of the water.
Mana regen is (according to every source I can find,
although it feels like less) the same but there's lots
more HP and AC with the BAOR/Heroism+ combo.

BAOR may not blow POTG out of the water if mana
regen is the only thing you care about.  But POTG isn't
better mana regen either.  Why would a cleric ever
prefer POTG to BAOR?  Only reason would be if
he could guarantee he was never going to get hit or
take AOE damage, and wanted to save mana...

What I meant was "as mana regen buffs go, BAOR blows
POTG out of the water since it results in far more HP
and AC while providing the same mana flow"
