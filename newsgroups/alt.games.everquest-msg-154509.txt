Wow, a top poster replying to a top poster.

Thats with the current system, if at all.  It might be
possible to retain or introduce such a difference
in the new system, but it doesn't have to work
that way.

I'm open minded, though, would you WANT it to mean
something different?

The damage taken formula could (should?) take in to
account defense skill, for example, doesn't that cap
out higher for warriors than it does for wizards?
