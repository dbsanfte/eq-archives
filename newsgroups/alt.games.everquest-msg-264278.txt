When my ISP (Qwest) started dropping messages, I signed up with Newsguy.
$40 for the year.  3 GB a month ( I don't need anywhere near that much).
It was a lot cheaper than a lot of the other pay services.  The speed is 
pretty
good overall too.
So far no dropped messages that I can find, and their messages go back
a few months.
