The Qeynos city zones are quite small.  Sounds like it is designed like 
Freeport is.  Just to get somewhere, I have to zone 2-4 times which gets 
old fast.  I would have thought EQ2 would be mostly zoneless, but I was 
wrong.  Why still use the zone system?  If its to make the city seem 
bigger than it is, thats a pretty lame design plan.

The 'find NPC' system the guards have seems pretty ignorant.  A lot of 
time, guards can't tell me where a NPC is if they have a prefix in front 
of their name (like Baker Soandso).  They can tell me maybe 20% of the 
time, if that high.
