You miss my point.  KEI is a buff and I have seen it go for less than 50pp
per shot.  I personally do not have the 30k+ pp in the bank to buy haste
items and such to give me anywhere near the edge that Casters with KEI have.
I think the problem lies in a caster looking at all the cool weapons that
TANKS can choose from and thinking that is a real advantage.  But, if a
Caster's Mana regenerated at the same rate as a Melee's HPs then you would
see our pain.  You can take a caster all the way down to zero mana and have
him med.  Then after a couple minutes he would be back to full mana.  As a
42nd level Warrior who has a STA of 134, If I went down to just 30% hp and
used bandages to bind wounds back up to 50%, I would still have to sit for
over ten minutes before I would be back to 100%.

All this ends up meaning that a comparable level caster can kill more mobs
and gain more EXP than a melee can this shows the imbalance in the game.  I
know why they added KEI.  I just do not see why they allowed it to be cast
on ay level of character.  Going on a plane raid you would need it.  But
giving it to a 5th level wiz so he can solo several levels before it expired
seems to be a huge imbalance in the game.
