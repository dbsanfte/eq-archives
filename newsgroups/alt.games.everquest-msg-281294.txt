I have several characters over 50.  I find, however, that I eventually 
tire of them somewhere in that range, or especially when I get up to the 
highest level, and start over.  Despite having 3 level 65s, and a half 
dozen more in the 50-60 range, I've spent most of my time in the 1-50 
range, and will continue to do so.  (The 65's all are "hit the wall" 
characters, I quit them before the 66-70 game was introduced... now if I 
ever take a character up past 60 again, I'll be likely to go to 70, and 
THEN get bored with him)

Why?  Because I don't like raiding, and as you level up, more and more 
thats where the game takes you.

As long as they continue to produce more content for high levels that 
involves raiding, and more content for low levels that involves soloing 
and small groups, I'll keep tiring of the high level and starting new 
characters to try new angles on the lower level game.

Trouble is, rather than make the low end more interesting, they seem to 
have tried to make it fly by faster, boosting exp and providing better 
gear and so forth at the low end, so you just fly thru it.

And the other problem is, fewer and fewer players seem to be playing 
that low end game, and those who -are- doing it are mostly speeding thru 
as quickly as possible, so its hard to get interesting groups to go do 
different things; if you don't want to do Tutorial>Kurns>PC>DSP you'd 
better be good at soloing.  Variations on the solo theme aren't nearly 
as interesting as the vast number of class/style combinations you can 
approach things with as a group.
