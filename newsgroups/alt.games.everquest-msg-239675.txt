Hi All;

I was in a group last night when our puller got his last leadership point he
needed to get "Mark NPC" . He announced it to the group (pickup group) that
he would mark the next mob to kill. (He was a chanty and mezzing multiple
mobs).  One of the group members says he can't see the ring because he
doesn't have the GoD expansion.

I thought that the leadership abilities would work on group members with or
without the GoD expansion.
If so, then in a group where only 3 had GoD and then half the group would
benefit, regen, marking, etc, and half wouldn't??  Is that correct?

Thanks in advance for clarifying this.
