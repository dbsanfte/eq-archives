"9.5":    So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the
idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege
them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and
keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them;
surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

It is now in context.

to Islam, you are correct, they need not be killed.  However, if they
refuse...
