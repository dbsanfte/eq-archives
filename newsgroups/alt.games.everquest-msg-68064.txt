 We recently tried Grieg Vendicous (unsure on last name) the other day.
He's one tough cookie and we didn't get him down very far. 80% maybe. He
has a nasty AE and a 1200damage knockback if I remember correctly. That
was only with an exploring group though so not sure how a fully prepared
raid would fare.
