To be honest, my definition of God is a work in progress, and probably
will be until the day I die.  At the moment I'm leaning towards God
knowing all that is possible to know, having the ability to do all that
is possible to do, and being as perfect as it is possible to be.  That
means he's not omniscient and omnipotent, but he's as close to that as
it's possible to get.
