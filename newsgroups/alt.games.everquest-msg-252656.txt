As long as the "virtual property" changes hand by the rules of the game
I see no problem. You can't sue anyone from winning your RL cash in poker,
can you?

It's an interesting legal situation in many ways, but I have no training
in American nor common law so I can't really judge the arguments of the
armchair lawyers in the NG. It does seem to me that no matter how the
sale of PP is advertised it is understood by both seller and buyer that
what is actually paid for is the transferring of plat ingame so that
the buyer controls it.
