	Right.  I think you understand that I was not saying "You are
wrong."  I was merely saying "You are claiming something as being factual
when, in fact, you don't know it's factual."  Or, as they like to say it in
the courtrooms:  "Presumes facts not in evidence."

	For what it's worth, I would indeed agree with you that the chances
of EQ passwords being grabbed as a consequence of sysadmins and hackers
sniffing packets along the route are quite slim.  I would surmise, based on
my own experiences, that most passwords are snagged either as a consequence
of poor password security (i.e. keeping them written on post-it note on
your monitor) or as a consequence of trojan infections.

	I know that there are documented cases of information of various
types being compromised via the high-tech method she describes.  However, I
very much doubt that there are any documented case of EQ passwords being
compromised via the high-tech method she describes.  People who can
compromise servers and switches in that fashion usually have bigger fish to
fry than simply getting passwords for an online game.

	Of course, I also confess that I stopped reading LG's posts with
any degree of thoroughness sometime yesterday afternoon.  So it's entirely
possible that she's since described a different sort of high-tech method
than I'm thinking of.  Caveat emptor, and all that.
