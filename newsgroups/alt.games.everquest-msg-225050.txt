OK, this is pretty unlikely, but consider: they are giving EQ1 new spell
effects, making big changes to the melee system, and doing at least one more
expansion.  They've added instanced dungeons and charms.  I seem to recall
them saying that they plan to continue developing EQ1 after EQ2 comes out.

Wouldn't it be interesting if they realize that with all the things they are
doing to EQ1, and all the things that they will be doing, the gap between
EQ1 and EQ2 will be smaller than they'd like (or even non-existent)?  If
that gap is too small, it might make more sense for them to just roll all
the EQ2 changes into EQ1 and not have a separate EQ2.  (Didn't something
similar happen with the planned UO2?)

If this does happen, I'll sure be laughing at everyone who buys LoEQ just to
get into the EQ2 beta. :-)
