Funny, I've played a mage for 55 levels - it happens ALL the
time.  Without fail - the reason I get on the hate list before
any other caster because the pet's out front - so of the sitting
casters, I'm at the top of the list.  It's a standing joke
in my regular group that adds forsake all others to come after me.

in other words "I can't be bothered to heal you, take
your chances on an add showing up and killing you before
I can get a heal off."

There are times when you have to go full burn
and draw aggro, and channel nukes through to
finish a mob - and you can't be low health
when it happens, or you aren't going to be able
to.
