Actually you would get 6 more int for 3 levels of AA. 1 aa point = 2 int point.
You can put in 5 aa into it for +10 int total.

30 mana here 10 mana there 20 mana more etc. It all starts to add
up to real mana after a while.

True but the extra AA intelligence might let you swap out some of
your old int gear for +hit point and +mana gear which a necro would love.

For instance, if I was a necro I would wear the Velium Jade jeweler made
rings for 5AC +30hps and +30 mana instead of a +int ring.
