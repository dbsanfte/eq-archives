It doesn't matter anymore.

My cox net one is used by automated programs, which also 
send to every other possible combination of cox.net emails. 
Even if you don't post you can still get hit by ones that just slam
your isp with every possible combination. Like the CC field in the
ones I get is always every possible combination around mine, or
sometimes mine is the CC field with a bunch of other ones.

So I've taken to dumping anything with an attachment to a "spam"
folder I check sometimes, since it seems that is what 99.9 percent of
emails with an attachment are. Emails which are not addressed to me
(like if I'm in the CC only) also go there.

I've sent some to cox, since it is obvious they are just trying every
possible combination of possible user names. Nothing seems to happen
though, I just get the standard "blah blah blah, thanks for reporting
abuse blah."  I'd think it would be possible to filter spammers at the
servers.

I use Agent for email, as well as news. 
Is there someway to cause emails to get filtered that use nonsensical 
pairings of words or letters in part of the subject? Like I get tons
like:

"Make it bigger foi3uoerueroe"

and such. You can kill every possible combination of the phrases they
use, but they use another one next time with "qoiuereoiu." So it would
help if you could just kill every nonsensical thing.

My guess is eventually it will die down, as they come up with more
laws and ISPS start filtering more. In the meantime it is irritating.
