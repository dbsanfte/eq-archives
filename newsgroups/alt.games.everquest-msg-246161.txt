I'm assuming you're not a necro or shaman? My shaman always had bw maxed,
thanks to canni, and my necro is really loving the new sit/bind rule.

The best way to max bind wounds is to find a high level warrior who's been
injured. You'll be amazed how many stacks it takes to have any effect on
them.

Hurting yourself on purpose will work, but realistically, if you solo and
you int/wis is reasonable, you'll max it, and grouped the healers tend to
disdain such things.. my monk was always having someone heal him to 50 %
before he could protest in his younger days. Then they would say OOM...
