Or if you join serverwide.age. <g>  I misstell on that channel a lot.

I have 3 accounts.  My mains are (different accounts, now) 60 enc, 53 dru,
52 wiz.

I also have a 33 cle (born 4/1/99), 28 bard (5/99), 43 mage (5/99)...those
are the alts I'll most likely play (mages are fun and danged useful so
that's my primary baby alt).

Hmmm, 20-29 gnome warrior, iksar monk, female dwarf rogue (with beard, of
course).

Gawd, toss in a few 1-9 twinks (ok anything under 50 is twinked somewhat)
and that takes care of my real chars.

Toss in a Hole and Kael corpse mule (my mage is my chardok CR mule), and
bazaar mule and that takes care of most.

I've taken over an account with a 52 necro, though he's just my corpse
summoner.  With running a guild there's barely enough time to work on my
MAIN main...my enchanter.
