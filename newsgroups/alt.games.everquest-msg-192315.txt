Does this mean I could wait until level 65 then rip into greens that would
have conned dark blue at 51 and still get AA exp ?

My beastlord is getting closer and closer to AA levels and I've heard alot
of people saying Run 3 is a must have, but at the same time I've heard its
slower than SoW.
When would be a good level to go for it? 51 or give it a few more levels to
make the AA exp that bit easier to get?
