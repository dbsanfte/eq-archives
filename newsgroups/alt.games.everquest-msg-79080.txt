As always I have to say the received wisdom is promulgated largely
by idiots who listen to specific-encounter-super-high-level advice and
apply it to everything in sight.

Level 60 druid and I regularly form the backbone of our groups, often
sans enchanter or cleric, and have no problems tearing up howling stones,
the hole, sebilis, etc.

Level 53? 4? necro and I had no problems ripping through the Grey.

Even going to ToV, etc, circle of seasons and POTG are very nice, saving
buff slots, providing extra mana, and so forth.

Not the absolute optimal most efficient group ever does not mean superfluous.
