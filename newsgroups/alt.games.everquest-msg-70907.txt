  This debate again.

  I am somewhat in the middle.

  Though I agree that the way most EULAs (and TOS agreements for
services relating to software) are ridiculous in that they give the
end user virtually no rights and give the manufacturer a license to
abuse the customer with substandard support, a faulty product, ect.
with usually no viable recourse, the software would not exist if
people did not pay for it.  A lot of labor is involved in creating
software and everybody up and down the latter deserves compensation
for their efforts.  Just because someone else doesn't hold themselves
up to a very high standard of behavior is not an excuse to do the same
(two wrongs don't make a right).

  My personal ethics on the subject are that I refuse to pirate
software that I otherwise would and can legitimately buy, for whatever
reason.  I might pirate an application to sample it, to see if it
suits my desires before buying... I'm not wealthy enough to spend
$20-500 on a piece of software and then just discard it because I find
it its user interface is counterintuitive, or because it's buggy or
unstable, or because my system can't run it fast enough, or for
whatever other reason.  I also will download roms and "abandonware"
games that I have recommended to me, if I cannot find someone to
purchase legitimate working copy from without making a huge chore of
it.  Once I downloaded an illegal copy of bleem! because it was easier
for me to find one on the Internet than it was for me to download the
demo version of the software on their web site (I kept getting weird
errors).  So while I do think there is a morally alright "grey area"
that while technically illegal, isn't entirely "wrong", there is a
line that can be crossed.

  But in the case of upgrading to Windows 98... I couldn't justify
pirating the software, even if I had convenient means to do so.  It's
software I DO get a lot of use out of, it meets my needs and it
functions precisely as advertised.  There is no legitimate reason not
to pay for it.
