A long time ago, alt.config was created for people to make proposals for
new alt groups to convince news admins to add them on their servers. I
haven't read it in about 5 years, as I stopped doing news administration
back then but even then it was getting less and less useful as some
people seemed to hang around the group just to say no to everything,
dispite most of them not even being news admins. This added enough
volume to the group to make it not worth reading for anyone with a job
to do.

Most high volume news transport servers now run on automatic pilot and
will pass any articles for newsgroups along to their peers. They'll
rarely be configured with a newsgroup list at all, but just pass along
anything that they get handed from their peers. They act more like
routers now than servers, with a small database of articles to cover a
few hours outage by a downstream peer.

The only way I know that you can get an alt group going is to get
someone who knows how to issue a newgroup control message and then get
as many interested parties as possible to ask their news admins to add
the group on their local news server. Large servers like supernews add
newsgroups either automatically or when they see enough traffic to trip
a threshold on some script. The days of hands on news administration are
mostly gone and it's likely most isps dont even have a dedicated news
admin on staff, just someone who's job includes making sure the server
is up and running.
