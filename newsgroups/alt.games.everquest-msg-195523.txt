Boosts my Sta from 85 to 100 (which I understand is a big number) and my
HP by a bit less than that (which seems to me isn't a big number)

Aye its a great line, as I know well from many many levels as a cleric.  I
mocked the 10% slow, not the line itself.  And even then I think its
better than it seems at first.

Problem is I'm looking at bard slow (worse than shaman slow) and Chanter
slow (massively better than shaman slow) and trying to look at the shaman
point to see if its useful.  As a bard, I frequently drop slow as not
making as much difference in a fight as other things I could be twisting
in... part of that is the relative smallness of the slows.  As a shaman,
if there's a chanter available I can't see slowing, but it looks like I
have far more effective slows available, and that they won't cost out to
25% of what I can supply to each fight.

Having played a necro up to mid 20s, its hard for me to see this early
cann/regen combo as "very powerful" but its something.  Regen also looks
like a sort of "slow" applied to the tanking character, reducing the rate
at which his (or my if I'm tanking) HP bar drops.  Necro works the other
way, mana keeps flowing all the time but HP drop if they dont have a life
leech running.  Canna also stacks with clarity which Dark Pact line does
not.

Aye it is a small window of opportunity at best, charm games are rarely
played well in a group (my bard does it sometimes when he's on light crowd
control duty, better than mezzing the add I figure... but its a technique,
not a plan)

And you can stick it to pets, which my bard can never do.  Going to have
to try bard/shaman combo sometime, seems like it would be very powerful,
charmed hasted mob should really chew up the other mob fast, plus bard and
shaman can both stack DOTs on the victim.  Won't be traditional bard "get
the pet killed" style work, more like chanter/druid "keep the pet afloat
and use his outrageous DPS" plan... but seems like a strong combo to me.

Played around with a chanter a bit today.  Invis at level 4.  Sigh.

Try using a UHOF sometime; 150 hp killing machine!  (heh, if he could
attack himself he'd be dead in one round)  I've seen dog-dog's used to
tank mez adds in POP zones.  Get em Aego (which is castable on pets
without level limit) and I bet a lot of that fragility goes away.  Be a
long time before I can experiment to find out for myself though.

What is it with Sony, anyway, I used to say my motto was "Verant trains us
Wrong".  Early levels we don't get examples of all our spell lines (and
melee tools and balance points), or the examples we do work radically
differently than at higher levels, so we learn all the wrong things about
our classes and how they operate.  I've sometimes suspected (warning,
Blasphemy alert) that to learn how a class works I'd be better off buying
a level 50 off EBay, so at least most of the working parts would be in
place!

Pull with DoT, then root to slow?

Seems odd.

I was pulling with slow, then using Flash to DoT, and flashing again to
reapply DOT or heal myself or if things were going really badly, to root
so I could heal myself better.  Flash is very fast and rarely resisted,
only trouble is some mobs path out to a point where they don't come
back!   Root would relieve a bit of that problem, and I suppose if I was
using it to DOT, the DOT would be on when it broke so I wouldn't care.

Still open is the question of how much the innorruuk snare neck matters.
I currently have an Iksar shaman, wanting natural regen, I thought when I
rolled him up that it was Ogres that could worship Inny, so the other
regen race wasn't able to get the snare either.  Now I'm considering
changing to Troll; I know snare works very well, but the question is, is
Clinging Darkness a good enough snare to be worth the bother?
