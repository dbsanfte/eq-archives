Hi all im just wondering if any of you have run into the same problem as me
with
trying to view magelo profiles and if you know how to solve it i would be
thankful.

Symptom - I keep getting a white background with the 2 grey panes where all
the graphics should be..
                  the welcome to magelo box i can move with my cursor it's
really weird.

Issues -    Takes awhile to load up the magelo website when it's done it
says
                on the bar below that there are errors, done. Background
also stay blueish.

Resolution -    ?
