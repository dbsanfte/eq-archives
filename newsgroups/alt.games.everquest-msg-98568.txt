Friends,

I know solo opportunities for Warriors are pretty far and few between,
but if anyone can recommend a good solo spot for a 36 Warrior, please
let me know.

What I would really like are some good places for pickup groups. I got
tired of HighKeep, and moved to the OT. I'm kinda tired of OT, but I'm
sure I'll be back. I know that pickup groups everywhere will be about
the same, but I would sure like to break up the monotany. I could see
making the rounds of two or three spots for a while.

I don't need to know the spots where one can "BYOG". I already know
them. and besides, if I HMOG, I wouldn't be posting here.

I don't want to know the spots where I could hunt with a partner. If I
had one, the subject of my post would be different.

All I would like advice on is PU and Solo spots for a currently 36
Warrior and the forseable future - say to 50.

Not trying to be mean or ungreatful, I just want any responses to be
on topic.

Oh yeah...I'm on Morell-Thule.

Thanks,

Aleheart
