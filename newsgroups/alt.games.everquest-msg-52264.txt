They aren't compelling for me, at all. There are *already* real
life differences in the game. That guy with all his cash who can
buy items on ebay? Well, he may well not have the time that kiddie
X who spends 12 hours a day has hunting.

Now, I'm not endorsing buying items on ebay; I'd rather it didn't
happen, but to suggest that real life circumstances dont already have
a material impact on what can be achieved in EQ, that its entirely
egalitarian and even in the possibility for achievement is
blind.

As for the effect on the economy, I'm unconvinced. I would be surprised
to find a significant amount of "for ebay" farming goes on; certainly
my experience in the game is that people farm for guilds, for items
they want, for trade, and so forth, but that is just personal
experience and not based on any objective empirical evidence.

The one argument that holds water for me is that this is a game; the
game system is enforced by server mechanics where it can be , and by
policy where it cant. If you ignore the policy, just because the
server cant stop you, then you're breaking the rules and cheating
the game, and the others who play by the game rules, as much as if you
went out and safe spot nuked Velketor into next week every time he
popped.

I think *thats* a compelling argument. I think its one many people
dont appreciate. But I also dont think someones an idiot for spending
money they can afford on something that "doesnt exist". None of
EQ exists, and we all here (presumably) spend at least 10 dollars
a month on it.
