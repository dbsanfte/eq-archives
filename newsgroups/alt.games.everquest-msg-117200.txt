Edit eqclient.ini (as said in above posts) to say ShowInspectMessage= FALSE,
you will no longer see inspect messages.
In game you can type /inspect off (or on) to toggle the ability to inspect
others by right clicking on them.
This will mean you know longer have a problem with accidental inspects from
you or from others.
This won't stop idiots standing in you face and blocking your view for
10mins while they look at your equipment but that's a minor gripe compared
to other episodes of moronic behaviour that can be experienced in EQ (or on
the Net in genereal)
