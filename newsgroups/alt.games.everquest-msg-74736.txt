Small update.  Since I just got done from a very..... eventful New
Years Party, I decided to do something stupid.  I decided to run my
level 13 Iksar monk from Cabalis to Luclin.

I put ALL my stuff in the bank except for some food and 5pp.  I took
off through the Swamp of No Hope and zoned into Fironia Vie.  I hugged
the wall of the zone until I got to the tunnel to the Dreads.
Luckily, as I got near the tunnel, I was that little wood elf bastard
that patrols the tunnel head out of the tunnel after a spider, so I
beat feet into and through the tunnel to DL.  I then zoned into DL and
commenced a very tense run to Karnors.  I managed to get there without
an excitement and announced that I was an idiot and could anybody sell
me a SoW to make it to the Hidden Valley.  A very nice druid (BIG
thanks to Udina on Xegony) gave me a SoW on the house and even offered
to TP me to the Hidden Valley so I wouldn't die an incredibly stupid
death.  I told her thank you very much, but no, I'm a moron and I want
to make the run on my own.  

ANYWHO, I scooted out of the Karnors entrance towards the edge of the
zone, just the other side of the Burning Woods entrance.  I managed a
surprisingly uneventful run to the tunnel and into the Hidden Valley.
From there I made it to Shadow Haven and bound myself and now Uelsmann
(my monk) is currently sitting on the Antonica platform waiting to be
TP'ed down to North Karanas.  I feel like smacking on some gnolls in
BB.  :-)

So, my point[1] is that it is POSSIBLE for a low level character to
make the run across DL to the Hidden Valley unscathed.  It's just a
little nerve wracking.

[1] Yes, I had a point.
