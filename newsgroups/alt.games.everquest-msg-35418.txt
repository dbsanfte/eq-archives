    Sometimes it's just a matter of biting the EC bullet and sitting for a
while. A buddy of mine is always doing "casual" farming (one sweep of Lower
Guk looking for rares before bed, that sort of thing) and had over 75
sellable items to get rid of. So in exchange for a few items for myself, I
sat my WAR in EC for two nights (likely 10 to 12 hours real time) and sold.
And sold. And sold some more.

    Most of his stuff was little items - Obsidian Bead Hoops, Orc Fang
Earrings, and the like. Those are easy to sell - my initial auction ran
along the lines of "BIG BANK BLOWOUT SALE! If it's low-end, I bet I have
it - send tells with class and slot!" It's also easy to make profit on small
items - a 5 pp raise in price can be a 10% or more markup, but nobody will
blink an eye at it. Also, as people contacted me I'd try to upsell depending
on class stated. "Wants earrings for an INT caster. Do you also need
leggings? I have a lovely pair of SIlversilk Leggings...." The best part was
when I'd invite people to come to me for an inspect and consultation - it
felt good giving younger players advice on what to wear, and what to avoid
at all costs (NO SERPS NEVER).

    At the end of the selling frenzy my friend had 7500 pp, Donal's Arms, a
Velium Etched Stone Mace, Spell: Turning of the Unnatural, and a Bracer of
the Reverent, AND the last seven items that would have taken another full
day to sell. He also had two Black Sapphires and a Blue Diamond that my ENCH
will turn into earrings for him. He'd given me nothing more expensive to
sell than Ro armour, and very little of that price range. He had NO idea
he'd been sitting on that much. Once the bank gets close to full, just sit
down and MOVE it - think of it as a reverse camp. ;-)
