That's not a problem for monk's with 100% weight reduction bags.  My monk
has all slots filled with 6-slot 100% weight-reduction summoned bags from my
mage.  I also give him a large supply of food, drink, bandages, coldstone,
throwing knives.  Now that summoned items last for 30 minutes if you go LD,
that's not really a problem now.  It's nice to have a mage that can summon
stuff for my other characters....and a druid to deliver them <g>.
