I started playing the first week the game came out.  Being a D&D'er from way
back when, I tried my best to role-play.  I always used the random name
generator so my characters would be named in the proper context.  Stupid
names really bothered me for a long time.  Eventually I got bored and quit.

I started playing again a couple of months ago and now I think the "stupid"
names are more appropriate to EQ.  This isn't a fantasy roleplaying game,
it's a weird hunting, camping and fishing game.  Names like "Illportya" and
"Rezman" are actually more "in-game" than "Draendielian".  Medieval European
names were often descriptive of profession or personality.  "Toone Nuukor"
in EQ is no less appropriate than "Smith", "Taylor" or "Potter" in merry
olde England.
