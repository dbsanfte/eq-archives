 Depends on where most of your points are, but I'd hazard a guess that
they're in MMC.  If so, at 150 I'd go for the Death Embracer's BP (I
did).  Stat-wise, it's pretty close to the thurgadin quest armor, ,
plus it has 3 aug slots, including a Type 3 for those nifty FT augs
you can get with more points later.  It might see you through til your
60 or so, depending on your play style and how twinked you are right
now.

But yes, there is always better gear available with more points.
Sometimes you need to invest a little to make it easier to get that
better gear.
