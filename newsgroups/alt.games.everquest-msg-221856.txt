So, I've finally joined the general consensus and started using
the fire pet for my main tank pet.  At level 39, with summoned
plate armor he seems to sponge decently, not as well as a water
pet but not tooo badly.  Not having to keep casting Barrier of
Combustion on him is a definate plus, thats expensive and short
duration, and I'm forever seeing it wear off in mid fight because
I tried to get two or three mobs out of a cast; plus his own
"free" DS is reportedly significantly better than my best one.

Best thing about this plan is its relatively flexible.  On lower
level mobs, which have some trouble hitting him, he does decent
damage by hitting them, and I can push things along by nuking to
match my mana regen rate.  Higher level mobs he has trouble
hitting.. but those can hit him easily and so hurt themselves on
the DS, while I spend my mana on healing him instead of nuking
(and also avoid them resisting my nukes)

There are limits, for one thing I'm still not a great healer by
any means, and so I can't take on really hard mobs this way.  And
it doesn't help that he is the worst tanker of all my pets.  But
when I tried this plan out at lower levels, it was altogether the
worst mana expended per kill method; now its finally the best
plan... IF flamey is tanking.

He's still not my pick if there's going to be a PC tanking,
though.

Splendid
