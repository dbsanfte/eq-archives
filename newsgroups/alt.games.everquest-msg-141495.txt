I'm not particularly upset. I didn't expect anything really. I'm more
annoyed with the setup taking hours than  not getting loot.
Next time I go on an open naggy raid I'm taking 4 or so stacks of gold bars
with me to enchant while waiting. Maybe some pearls and vials to make
mana... Pity there's nowhere to fish in zone.
(I was counting... went 107 /randoms without winning once.. of course that
was small stuff, but still)
