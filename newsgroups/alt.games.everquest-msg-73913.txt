  It's a bigger hassle (and usually a bigger mana drain) to teleport
someone than it is to SoW them or buff them.  As a druid I'd SoW
virtually everyone I met without being asked and I'd usually buff a
person for free as well if they did ask, but teleports I'd still
charge for except for close friends and guildmates, or unless I just
happened to be on my way to the place where somebody wanted me to
teleport them to.

  Take that for whatever it's worth.
