In one thread recently I was surprised to learn that LOIO apparantly
no longer has its famous exp bonus

In another thread I was musing that adding an exp bonus to the less
visisted zones might help get them visited more and reduce crowding
on the current few "popular" zones.

It occurs to me that I don't know which zones have a bonus now,
really, nor how much, in most cases.

Anyone got a list or a pointer to a list?
