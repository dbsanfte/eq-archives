There's zero need for such a file. EQ is multiplayer only. You don't
play without contacting a server. The server passes the character
state information to the client, and updates the state as the game
goes on. It's all done in memory.

Games which *do* have a single-player option, where you don't have 
to contact a server, run into the kind of hacks described in this
thread if they aren't careful.
