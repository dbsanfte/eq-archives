*** News from the Vale ***

Clan Death Fist has long had a minor presence in the Misty Thicket, preying on
the Halfling farmers and tradesmen. Recently the Death Fist Clans numbers in
the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting down trees and mining the
rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have come in to Rivervale that the Orcs
are shipping the lumber and ore to the commonlands and stockpiling it for an
unknown purpose. Whatever the Deathfists agenda, their increased presence
has made the thicket a more dangerous place beyond the protective wall.

Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to Rivervale lie
mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once stood at these sites
are fragments of walls that are presumed to have been constructed around
the same time as the nearby ruined tower.  An ancient magical scarecrow
stands at the center of one of these ruins and warns passers by that the place
is cursed. It is a popular belief among the halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled
walls once surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their
owner and caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the
scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin and the
animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the there and buried
after their death by an unknown evil.

With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye Citadel
the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has grown. These
somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude Iron Ore from
the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to forge weapons and
armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of Runnyeye Citadel from the
Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these semi-exiled goblins are being
far less troublesome than they have the potential to be.
