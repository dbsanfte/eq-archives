This kind of thing happens when swarm kiting, it is quite rare that you 
do a perfect swarm.
If you have a few mobs still chasing you, run around the mobs that are 
fighting your pet, or try to path the persuing mobs through the fight. 
They will eventually engage your pet, unless you have agroed them in 
some other way.

Try the Spirocs in OOT.
