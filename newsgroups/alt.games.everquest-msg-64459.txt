After 6 hours of downloading, 1 1/2 packs of cigarettes, 12 pack of Cola,
and a Zanax... I've finally received all files able to play. The play button
pops up and after clicking it, a message pops up  "No 3D devices found". I
have a NVidia RIVA TNT2 model 64, and using DirectX 8.1.  Anyone know what
I'm doing wrong or how I can set up my 3d device? Any help is welcomed.


Thanks!
Thaur
