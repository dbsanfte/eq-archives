So why didn't LoS? It's not Verant's responsibility to contact them.

The Beastlord class has been missing AA skills, and is still
incomplete after 9 months. Is there some kind of 3 month rule where
guilds are allowed to exploit if Verant hasn't fixed the problem?

If they insist on raiding it, then they have to be prepared to accept
the bugs. Choosing to exploit was a bad idea, and now they have to pay
the piper.

Funny. I would assert that LoS should have learned from the experience
as well. I think Verant did learn. They handed out suspensions (and
only banded the accounts that were soul marked).

Plenty of zones to play in that aren't broken. You said yourself the
RvR was better in NTOV.
