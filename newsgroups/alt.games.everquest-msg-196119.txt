I seem to remember FoH or a similar uberguild using a naked Bard as main 
tank on an Avatar of War raid, and that got me thinking... With dual 
wield and two or three DoT songs twisting away, Bards probably can be 
veritable aggro machines if they wanted to. While too fragile for a 
standard XP group, I'm thinking that maybe there could be specific raids 
where the MT keeping aggro at all costs is paramount, no matter what the 
healing costs incurred, and perhaps a Bard could be a non-obvious but 
wise choice for those.

Am I onto something, or am I smoking the good stuff here?
