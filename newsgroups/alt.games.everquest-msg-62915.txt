well if he was setting up there computers, and taking gaming into
account then any machines built in the last year should be ready to go
with at least a geforce /radeon level board and 128 megs of memory.  

which means that you pop over to www.crucial.com and order up some
memory.  then you go to windows update and DL the newest directx
version.  and boom you should be all set to play the game.

of course if he went with onboard video, even a 1 ghz system is going
to play like a 300 mhz p2.  but i just put a radeon pci in one of
these and worked fine with the direct x 8. and test server.   

On the other hand, there area alot of people out there with various
Dells and other with new supposedly fast machines that have onboard
video.  if those systems choke on Luclin, then EQ is going to have a
serious problem.  And if DAOC can look as good as it does, then LUCLIN
is going to have to be Fn amazing with its far higher claimed
requirements.
