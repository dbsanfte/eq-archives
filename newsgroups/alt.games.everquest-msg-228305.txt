    The last two are where you fail. People don't want to play guards while
other players (the ones being guarded) have fun playing the gamey parts of
the game. What could you possibly offer someone that would make up for not
having fun, and which would match what gains they could make playing the PvE
portions of the game, which couldn't be exploited? That's why PvP really
fails - because PvE has value, value that cannot be matched by taking up
boring positions like guard. The best PvP games are ones in which there is
no PvE element to offer alternate methods of advancement, like a first
person shooter.

    So how is power gained, since the nurturing mechanic is one of the most
important for a roleplay-type game? If the answer is "it isn't", you have a
first person shooter. If you do have power gains that are actually
challenging (and thus fun to pursue) and worthwhile, how do you separate
time played from achievement level? You're trying to toss away some of the
things that make a PvE game great, and still claim that the PvE in the game
will have value. And don't throw out the tired idea of achievement through
collective PvP success, like RvR in DAoC. Not only does that still reward
time played, it also causes people to abandon the losing side for the
winning team (another problem many team-based PvP games have yet to solve).

    ...you will be far ahead of every other person that's tackled the issue,
and failed. Good standard to hold him to. :-/
