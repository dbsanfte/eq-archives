Post 20 your chances of grouping with people that actually know what they
are doing increases.  You can run through most of the travel zones without
being eaten by every random spawn. You can begin to collect some plat when
you hunt and start to buy some better gear.  You get better abilities and
spells and the people you group with do too.  Dungeon crawling becomes an
option, which IMO, is a lot more fun (and more dangerous) than outdoor
zones. The world of Norrath starts to open up a bit and you can start seeing
the world (or at least a much larger piece of it).
