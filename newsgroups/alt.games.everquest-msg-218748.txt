And so once you get past assigning such a rigid, constructed limitation to
your scenario, we find out that you won't actually pull at under 80%.  Which
means that you're not actually playing *exactly* like me.  See, either you
say "I *have* to have this huge buffer" or you play more aggressively. 
*You* through this whole thread have said "I *have* to have this huge
buffer, but I'm *still* going to play just like you".  To which I refer you
back to an example series of starting pulls and how I pull ahead of you not
just on one occasion due to your insistence on being overly cautious.

And the moment you come back here and say "but I'm not being overly
cautious, I'm pulling at the exact same time as you" I will respond once
again that the two concepts are mutually exclusive, you're a fool for making
two such disparate contentions in the same breath, but probably won't bother
to explain all this once more for the chronically slow.  I get bored of
saying the same thing without meeting any comprehension.
