Here's another good one for you. Don't you just love how every now and 
then a little window comes up from the taskbar informing you that you 
have unused icons on your desktop and offers to get rid of them for you?

Personally, I have "unused" items on my desktop that are simply 
infrequently used. But I like them on my desktop. I want them on my 
desktop. And by God they are staying on my desktop.

So I really, really hate it when MS pops up obnoxious messages like this 
and distracts me from using my system. I would greatly prefer they mind 
their own damned business and let me worry about what's on my desktop. 
Do they really think users are so helpless and stupid that they cannot 
delete old icons they do not use if they feel like it? Apparently 
somebody in Redmond thought this would a nice "helpful" little feature. 
I find it obnoxious and annoying. Whenever they implement something like 
this I hate it.

Remember Microsoft Bob? (was there ever a worse software product name by 
the way?) It was sooooo helpful. It was so sickenly helpful. That's why 
nobody bought it. I loved it when that happened. :-)

I don't like cutesy little attempts to "help" me that insult my 
intelligence.
