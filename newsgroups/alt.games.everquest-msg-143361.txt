No, the motive in both cases is greed, rather than hatred.

No, actually, most non-biased hate laws wouldn't.  You're welcome to 
campaign for such an extension to existing laws, I wouldn't object.

Normal street crime, the motive is greed.  If it's a street crime in which 
the attacker is motivated by hatred of whatever class the victim is, then 
I'd support it being treated as a hate crime.  But how many times do you 
hear about cases where the attacker screamed "fuck you you poncy 
upper-class twit/proletariat stooge/bourgeois pig!" before attacking?  And 
in how any hate cimes do you think that they bother to loot the victim?  I 
mean eww.  They might get cooties. 

Yes.  It is very hard to distinguish a hate crime from a normal crime.  
But 'very hard' is actually relatively easy to distinguish from 
'impossible'.  And I'll bet that the law errs much more often on the side 
of not prosecuting it as a hate crime, since that condition is vastly 
harder to provide evidence for, beyond a reasonable doubt.  I do not think 
that makes it not worthwhile to enact and support such legislation, 
however.  

I know there are people on this earth who do not love their fellow human 
beings, and I -hate- people like that.
