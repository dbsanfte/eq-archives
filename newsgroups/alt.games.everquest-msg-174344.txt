And I am finally leaving this game. Going out with a bang and not leaving
someone on my account I deleted both my rogue and uber twink necro. I
managed to give a newbie iksar necro my hotr + zlandicars heart and
everything else before deleting. He was very greatful. Its been fun all, but
now I have to move on.

I will be playing Battlefield 1942 on the GameArena servers (Australian)
until SWG is released. I really like how the gameplay in SWG has been setup.

If you don't know yourself, take a look at this. Its a long read but this
game will be alot more fun for me.
