Exactly, that info seems to be missing but I'll start posting on the ezboard
you linked. Someone there will probably know.

/agree. Furthermore, as someone with a fairly heavy RL schedule who still
wants to make a substantial commitment to gaming, I only have time for one
MMOG in my life at a time. I'm expecting there's a good chance that when EQ2
comes out I'll be migrating to that world and consolidating my time
investment there. So this may be my final run through and I believe the
timing is good; EQ2 is far enough out that I should have time to take my
Shaman to 65, but there won't likely be time for other alts.
