Actually, that seems quite different from D&D multiclassing, because there
will be separate pools for XP, and the XP for each pool is earned in a
different way (e.g., it's not like, say, AA points in EQ, where you earn XP
the same way and decide which pool to put it in).

In D&D, if you are, say, a 12 Cleric/8 Fighter, then you are a 20th level
character, and you would have HP and stats and melee abilities appropriate
for 20th level.  You'd be somewhere between a 20th level Cleric and a 20th
level Fighter in those areas.  In effect, it would be like you were 20th
level in some kind of hybrid class that mixes Figher and Cleric.

It sounds like in EQ2, on the other hand, that the 40 Cleric/19 Scholar
would basically be a 40 Cleric as far as adventuring goes, and a 19 Scholar
as far as tradeskills go.  Someone looking to put together a raid wouldn't
think of this person as level 59 of some hybrid class, but rather would
think of them as a 40 Cleric.
