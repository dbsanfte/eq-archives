I would agree with your statement that police do not have the right to hit
someone who spits at them, which is why I stated this as a "right".  It was
some type of police brutality issue with the PD declaring that this officer
was within his rights becuase the suspect had spit at him, and might give
him a disease or something, and spitting at a police officer is a *felony*
while its only a misdemeaner for anyone else.
