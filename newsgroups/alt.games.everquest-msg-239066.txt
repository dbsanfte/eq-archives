Um, DT, if you read the post, he specifically talked about using the 
(dmgx2+1)/dly formula to compare them as main hand weapons.  He was not 
ever talking about the dmg/dly ratio, and that was actually pretty clear 
from his post.

Here, just for you, his post:

"Unless the oft repeated formula of ((2*damage)+bonus)/delay doesn't
actually work to compare weapons - it's not superior to other weapons
that cost the same.

(WLK = 2.1, Pale Velium Cestus = 2.1) for a 65th BL

It also lacks the HP that WLK has."
