Whenever a player does something shitty, folks start talking about their
Lists.  No group list. No rez list. No buff list. No port list. You get
the idea.  

Well, I was just thinking about this...and realized that such a thing
being slapped on me would mean diddly squat. I haven't asked for a rez or
group or port from a stranger for months.  I *do* get KEi/Virtue on
occasion, but I've started to not bother because it isn't really necessary
for us.  So if someone said "Nyah, you big jerk, I'm putting you on my no
buff list!" I'd probably blink and say "OK" in that Adam Sandler voice.  

Now, I'm honest to a fault.  I have a mental block against taking what
belongs to others, and that includes everything from camps to cash.  So I
don't think I've made too many lists. BUT...let's just say I did..would I
really care? 

For those of you who are more social (always full-group, a lot of guild
interaction)...would it actually hamper your game if a lot of folks
thought you were a dipshit and wouldn't help you?  Or are these threats of
"You won't get *my* help anymore!" about the same as yelling at your DSL
company for screwing you over and saying "I'mna tell all my friends
never to use your DSL!".  

On the flipside, I *have* found that if one has a reputation for being
honorable and nice, folks come out of nowhere to give you a leg up at the
oddest times.  Although....I have also seen completely clueless morons
being given the same help and leg-up, though, so I think it might just be
pure chance.
