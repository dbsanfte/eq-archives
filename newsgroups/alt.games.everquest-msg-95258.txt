From this non-us (Welsh) bloke:-

Personaly i'd like you to shoot the bastards.Preferably starting with the
brits. 

Considering that our current govermental stance on terrorist organisations is
to let them have a seat in our House of Parliament, If they ever do get
extradited back to this country our judicial system is so fucked up (by those
"bleeding hearts")  that they will be back on the streets in no time.

Hell, i'll even buy you the damn bullets.


Simon
     You'll be surprised how many of us non-americans wil quite happily stand
by your side. You just need to avoid listening to the bullshit newspaper
sensationalism.
