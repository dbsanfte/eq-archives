I dunno... I've tried to read posts written in other languages (thinking
that the post *itself*, even if the subject line isn't), thinking they
<might> be in english, Can anyone tell me why (at a wild guess) people post
to an english ng, in their (obviously) native tongue? Secret code? A secret
wish to piss people off? Like posting in elven when the rest of the group is
dwarven!

just wondering...
