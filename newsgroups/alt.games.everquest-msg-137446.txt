Scares hell out of me. If you are looking for a good book read " Mao" by Dr.
Li. he was Mao's personal physcian ( western trained too)

I would not say stolen and from the history books I read Britain gave back a
lot to those countries.

Perhaps but the steel industry here is gone - it is known as the rust belt.

That is really the truth. Some american historians believe that WWI made
Britain a pacifist nation which hampered her efforts in WWII. But WWI had
tremendous casaulties. Both wars did take the flower of the nation.

Meanwhile Germany was recovering with the Marshall plan. Seems we were
kinder to the enemy than to the allies. I have wondered abou that. But I
guess that may have prevented future European wars; since soem of the seeds
of WWII was the Versailles Diktat.

That is chilling assesment you have there.

I wish you would but I understand the problem. Those Royal Marines are the
best troops I have ever seen.

Now I can see why you are so frustrated with what you regard as Ameican
mistakes. And some are mistakes. But the future is dificult to predict.

Well I am not sure I am. I think some of those colonies you gave up would
probably be better off still under British rule. But I do not know if they
would be a drain or  an asset.
Did you get my e mail on the books? I am still interested in your  viewpoint
on the Balkans?
