This happens because the wolves con amiable to you.  Wolves used to "help"
my druid all the time when I fought in EK.  If you spend a lot of time
hunting in the Karanas as a druid you will see this often.  They used to be
able to take your exp away, which was very very annoying, but I think VI has
fixed that.

Best Regards
