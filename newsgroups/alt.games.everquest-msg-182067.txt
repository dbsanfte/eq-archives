I think he/she(*) mean that they were expecting the midlevel AA to cost
2, 4, 6 points each *cumulatively*, i.e. 2 points each rather than 2, 4
then 6 points.

The Mental Clarity AA cost 2 points for the first level, 4 points for
the second and 6 points for the third, so it will cost 12 points if
you want MC3. (I assume that's what you meant by FT/Flowing Thought.)

So far I have zero AA... keep wondering when I should stop to pick
up a few. The healing AA look very useful... but perhaps not as useful
as BAotR at level 58. FT6 > FT3.
