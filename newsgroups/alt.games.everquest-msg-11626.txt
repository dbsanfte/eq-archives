Altho this may sound like the micro$oft "That's not a bug, it's a feature" I
believe that it is intentional.

Example, You have (in my Bards case, say) a set of Icetooth's claws and a
blade of fiery aggro all in near vicinity, if the first weapon went straight
to primary slot and the first weapon I clicked was the blade then the Claws
would drop into inventory as they are Prim hand only and that space is now
taken.
Of course you could argue that this would not work in the case of off hand
only weapons (stormfeathers talons, for example) but I'd say there are a
damn site more prim only items than offhand only ones.

That's my suggestion anyway, who knows, it could be a bug :ï¿½)
