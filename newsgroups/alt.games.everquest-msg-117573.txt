He, as in eqatlas?  If so, then you are mistaken about Kunark, he has maps
for all but 3 Kunark zones.  He does not have any planar maps, Velious and
Luclin are certainly missing quite a few maps.  There are maps for all of
the outdoor zones, and for many indoor zones.  At this point he does not
have maps for 21 zones in total, out of 140+ zones in the game.

eqatlas has the following:

Antonica - all zones
Faydwer - all zones
Odus - all zones
Kunark - all zones except for Chardok, Howling Stones, and Veeshan's Peak
Velious - all except for Skyshrine, Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto,
Temple of Veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb, and Velketor's Labyrinth.
Luclin - all except for Acrylia Caverns, Akheva Ruins, The Deep, Fungus
Grove, Grieg's End, Ssraeshza Temple, and Vex Thal.
Planes - none
