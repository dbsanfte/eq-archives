One of the warlords on Steel Warrior posted a concept to that effect
quite a while ago which I liked. Not exactly a "new zone" which would
require all sorts of new files, etc. But a "revamped sleepers". I mean,
it's *already* a revamped ST, just crappier, so why not? His idea was,
basically, that once Kerafyrm was awake and off on his travels about the
multiverse destroying this and that, a group of his Minions (some sort
of high level, fairly uber minions on the same faction as Kerafyrm and
fighting for the rights of dragon cross breeding, loyal to the Sleeper,
etc.) would appear to keep his ancestral home safe waiting for his
return. That would have been a good addition to the story line, but
still given the developers the opportunity to take much of the warder
level loot and spread it out across these new "pro-Sleeper" minions. 
The zone could then provide roughly the same level of challenge, and
risk/reward, while still allowing one guild to claim the honor of
triggering the one time content without as much wailing and gnashing of
teeth from the boohooists.

And frankly, with all the other zone revamps going on, there's no reason
that they still couldn't do that today, IMO.  It could just be a case of
it having taken a while for the minions to be assembled and dispatched
to ST to set up housekeeping.
