It's a tough run if you have a full group of Kaesora-inexperienced level
40s.  Piece of cake with any level 50+ group, even if they're inexperienced
and you get lost (likely).  I'd recommend you take an enchanter with you for
AE mezz if you get swarmed (at any level) though at 50s you might just need
a talented healer & backup healer...and people who've gotten the Clue that
"Root is your FRIEND."
