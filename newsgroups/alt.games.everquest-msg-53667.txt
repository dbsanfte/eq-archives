 Yeah I know. Sometimes I spend a lot of time in various Velious zones and
collect a lot of weapons that are very nice for newbies. I have Tink baqs
so I can carry a lot around to hand out as I see fit. So many times I've
given a nice weapon that would cost 250pp or so to buy in Thurg and minutes
later notice the guy is weaponless smacking bats with his bare fists again. 
I ask him "what happened to the nice sword I just gave you?" "I sold it" he
says. "Why????" I ask. "I got 12pp for it!!!". 
 
 Some people you just can't help, no matter what. I've pretty much stopped
doing things like that. Screw em.
