What a sad life.  I have friends that don't play any games at all.  My life
would be less of a life if I only chose to share my friendship with people
who not only share the same interests, but share them to the same degree, as
you apparently have.  I have friends that make six figures and friends that
work at burger joints.

I have "acquaintances" that nearly mirror my life.

Or better yet, accept that people who have different interests, or even
different degrees of the same interests, can still be good friends.  Even
useful friends, which is apparently your criteria for friendship, as you can
learn from their experience.

Useful and/or useable is not synonymous with "better".   =P

I must change my original response though.  I thought you were merely
conceited.  Self serving and manipulative would be a more apt description.
