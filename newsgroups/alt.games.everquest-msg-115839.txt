You _shouldn't_ have any problems, but a friend of mine did...
He had the exact same setup as you (as did I for that matter) but
when he installed Velious and went there the first time all the
mobs looked like bandits... Big bandits for giants, small bandits
for snow bunnies.  He uninstalled EQ, both Velious and the original,
reinstalled and... still bandits.  The only way around it was to
use MY velious disk from when the expansion was first released 
(ie. not the mini-box).

ANOTHER wierd thing- I bought the trilogy box, installed it and had
loads of problems with sound and the machine hanging when I camped.
Also, the tutorial didn't even run (some dll warning).  All this on
a brand spanking new formatted machine.  After a reformat (joy) I
installed eq in the standard EverQuest directory (not /Sony/EverQuest
Trilogy/ as defaulted in the install) and everything is smooth.

Just some helpful hints if you happen to run into some wierdness.
