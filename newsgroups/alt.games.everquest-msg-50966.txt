I am about 30 levels too low, to know much about the level 60 game, but is
this really a problem for level 60's? Does anyone know of such a case?

I have grouped with people who didn't seem to know what they were doing, and
I'm pretty sure they didn't buy their accounts from e-bay.

I would say that if level 60's are grouping with a level 60 enchanter who
has zero experience, then such poor judges of their fellow players, would be
in deep trouble before the zero experience enchanter had even joined them.
You would have to wonder how they ever got to such a high level, if they
could be fooled by someone with zero experience. Unless, of course, they had
all bought the accounts. Now that would be a sight worth seeing, and a
definite pro for the e-bayers.
