Some buffs don't do quite the same thing when cast on pets.  Strength 
for example affects melee damage to a lesser degree for NPCs/pets than 
for PCs.  It does seem to help the pet reach its damage cap more often 
so may be worth casting.

Resistance buffs may not do anything on pets.  I have heard that the pet 
has its own resistances or its owners, probably whichever is higher.  I 
don't know for sure.

I have had haste not take on necro pets sometimes, but I think it was 
because the pet already had a buff from its owner.  There was a rumor 
that charmed pets over a certain level (62?) couldn't be hasted.  This 
was supposed to have gone in on a recent patch but I'm not sure if it 
did or not.

HP buffs, dex, and haste seem to be quite effective on pets.  When 
choosing which buffs to cast, keep in mind the pet's role.  If it is a 
supplemental damage dealer, put on strength, dex, haste, and any 
available procs.  If there is a chance it might be tanking and be the 
only thing between you and a quick death, pile on the HP, AC, symbol, 
regen, stamina, and keep heals ready.  Mages have pet only heal spells, 
and may be able to heal the pets of other mages using them.  Beastlords 
have very nice pet only heals too.  Pets are usually lower level and 
take a lot of damage quickly.

If you expect your pet to keep up with you, then yes, it needs SoW too. 
  Shaman pets used to come with free SoW, but they don't any more (and 
presumably they don't get lost as often any more).

I don't play a pet class, so apologies for any inaccuracies :)
