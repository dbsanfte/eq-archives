Howdy,
  First keep in mind that Win2k wasn't exactly made with gaming being the
forte of it's operation.  If you look at your IRQ propertied, does a lot of
your installed hardware share IRQ's?  This is common.  When installing Win2k
there is an option (it's been awhile, so I can't quite explain where it is)
that allows you to set up the resources "as a generic windows machine" or
something to that effect.  This should distribute the IRQ's a little more
rationally.  Mine used to all share IRQ 9.  I had no problems, but didn't
like the potential conflict.
Also, try dual-booting if you really need win2k for other things.  Win98 is
far superior for gaming with the exception of the 128MB ram cap.

Good luck.
