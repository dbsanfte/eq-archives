Monster missions have added a great tool for the casual gamer to log in
for an hour and get an AA, then log out.  There are also tasks of
course; I never got in to those.  And if you have something more like 1
- 2 hours, you can think about doing DoN and DoD missions.

Well they have certainly upped the quality of gear available to
non-raiders.  With DoN cultural gear adding as much as 225 HP per item,
DoD drops with 200+ HP, augments all over the place, MPG trials are
doable by non-raiders (nice stuff in there), and weapons available to
non-raiders with even-or-better ratios, they have certainly thrown some
bones to those of us who cannot or will not join a raiding guild.  (I
use HP as the standard measure of item quality, though similar items
with nice mana and focus effects are also obtainable)  You still need
to spend a lot of time to get the very best stuff, but even a casual,
few-hours-a-night player can accomplish some remarkable goals.

The problem with EQ is that starting out as a noob can be frustrating.
When I started in 2002, there were actually people in newbie zones that
you could group with.  You could make friends along the way.  Now the
entire population is so top heavy, it must be frustrating to start out
with no money, no gear, level 1, no friends, no guild, and an empty
home city.
