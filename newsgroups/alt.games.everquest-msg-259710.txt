I'm with you on that one.  Once they understand that I work for my ISP,
they're usually a little more responsive.  I guess partly because they
feel they can skip most of the "are you SURE the cable is plugged
*directly* into the wall?" questions.

My worst nightmare with them happened when there were large changes in
structure due to a change in regulations.  I moved about 4 houses down
the road.  All they had to do was move the service.  They were changing
their paperwork procedures.  In the end, it took ~3 months for them to
get my service moved.  On the up side, I was credited ~6 months in the
process as I called each month to tell them they were charging me for a
service I wasn't being provided.

Oh, and on a side note, have you seen this?

Just in Texas right now, as I understand, but hopefully Western
Washington isn't far down the list!
