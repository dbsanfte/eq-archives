Something very strange happened to my group in Cobalt Scar today.

We were sitting on the beach near the bulthar, medding up between
Siren pulls. I go afk for 60 seconds. I come back and discover I'm at
1 bubble of health and my screen is full of damage messages and "run
Whit!" shouts from my guild mates.

I high-tail it across the beach in something of a state of shock.
Nothing ever aggros me on the beach. The Othmir are indifferent to me,
and the drakes and wyverns look upon me kindly (happily I've never had
a bulthar trained on me). I quickly check my guild mates health --
both full -- then I gate out to heal up and try to figure out what
happened.

A mob called "Tomar" (or something pretty close to that) had attacked
me. Amongst the combat messages was one from a necro (who I found out
later was level 58) saying "It ate my pet. How strange." The mob
aggroed onto my guild mates who both ported out.

I ported back in and couldn't find the thing on track. I think one of
my guild mates described it as a lava crawler with a glowing ball in
the center, but I'm going to double-check that with him. 

Nowhere on the net can I find reference to this mob. It might have
been a GM event since today was the day for that, but somehow I doubt
it. Has anyone ever heard of this thing?
