Just loaded SoL. I find that when in first person view (which I nearly always
use), when in combat I now I see a vague blur and a large pair of teeth when I
make a stroke. Anyone else getting this. It is very irritating to the point
that after a few fights my vision was giving me problems and I hgad to quit!
