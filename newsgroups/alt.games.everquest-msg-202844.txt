<<<<<<<And just to add a tad more about a KEI'ed wizzy on overburn or cleric
going
nutty with the heals due to KEI.

LoL !. What they get to enjoy Kei for oh 5 or 6 minutes maybe.
As if any pure mana caster could go all out in fights without getting
stomped.

What did KEI do ? Eliminated a lot of silly boring downtime.
Got groups into zones that were byog. Did having KEI for everyone hurt any
one. Nope.
I have only seen people having fun with it. But oh this is work not a game
so lets make sure everyone is challenged by downtime. As if downtime has any
form of challenge to it. Other than everyone taking 10 minutes to go for a
beer, smoke, afk, scan web pages etc. KEI eliminated that.
Agreed it had the seldom and rare problem of some players leaving a group to
refresh KEI. But same as folks needing SoW or running to bank all the time
they get booted and replaced.

Every *****NERF***** done in the game has never ever been called a nerf by
Sony.
Always called a fix , balancing, adjustment or whatever...
But if it feels like a nerf. Looks like a nerf. Walks like a nerf.. hmmm
Well I calls em the ways I sees em
It was a NERF /shrug. play don't play whatever but it wasn't the first nerf
and won't be the last.>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Thank God I've finally found a post by someone who understands it.  There is
still hope for this world.  The rest of you act like there is some skill or
great talent required to play your character without KEI.  What a joke.  My 12
year old nephew can manage his mana it's not a very hard game.  Downtime sucks.
 Downtime is boring.  Medding sucks.  Medding is boring.  Some people just
liked having KEI because it meant more action for them and their friends.  A
lot of people have lives and families and other things they have to do.  We all
don't have time to waste sitting around waiting for mana to come back.  Who
wants my stuff?
