As I dimly recall, Win98 used a paging scheme of some sort to manage
memory. It would actually make use of additional memory to store
information, but would only 'work' on the limited memory page. The
effect you were seeing stems from it being a *lot* faster to move data
around in memory, even when it's not 'active' memory, than from disk
to memory.
