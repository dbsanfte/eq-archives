First of all, grats with 60 ;)

As you might have noticed your spells are now starting to become more
focussed on specific tasks. Several spells are pretty useless outside of
raids or specific uses (rains, mala, banishment). You might want to keep
that in mind when spending big cash for random spells ;).

I mostly used cadeau when in boring chainpulling groups. Basically to not
have to worry about the timing on the MT. I have used it in a few groups
more effectively with 2 tanks and a couple of rainers (rains work best with
2 targets).
In LDoN groups group-ds is pretty usefull because more often then not
several players get hit (puller, slower, overnuking wizzie etc etc).
Still all things considered not all that usefull unless you need the FR.

Do keep a DS on the MT though. It's still your most efficient damage per
mana spell aside from your pet.

Banishment checks against magic. Dropping a mala first increases banishment
chance to about 90%. Only used it in trials as well, there simply aren't any
summoned mobs on which it would be marginally usefull.

Erm, let me guess, castersrealm?
Banishment doesn't do damage, it removes a single summoned mob level 46 or
lower from the game. Basically anything you will be hunting at lvl 60+ is
higher level so it's worthless in that respect. Only other place where it
could be used is in The Hole, but summoned mob hp is so low there that
normal nukes are more efficient. Plus you get the exp with normal nukes ;).

The damage figures maybe comes from trial-evaluations. The mobs you banish
there have around 10k hp. Destroying it outright basically equals a 10k
nuke.

A small note: if the water pet isn't in backstab position it gets a free
additional attack that round.
It is the highest dps pet you have at that level. I used it when I was lvl
60 all the time in groups. Not suitable for soloing afcourse, that's what
the earth and air are good for.

For melee positioning: I trained the tanks in my guild to backup a bit after
engage. Mob will follow and pets will follow after. Gets all the pets in the
back pretty fast without much problems.

You forget you also get Manastorm :).
Mages used to have only Manastorm as the end-all rain. Manastorm even has
worse resists because it has 2 checks against MR. Mages wined and nagged and
finally got a single MR check magic rain: Maelstrom of Electricity. It costs
a bit more mana then manastorm but has about 10-20% less resists.

Anyway, rains are usually pretty high dps when you chain 2 right after
eachother. The main benefit is that the damage is split over a period of
time applied in smaller chunks. This gives you less aggro then nukes for the
same mana, while still doing your best dps.

The hardcoded extra resists give rains a bad rep, and deservedly so. Even
the wizard lure rain gets about 1 out of 4 waves resisted. They're pretty
crappy for sustained dps in groups and are rather untrustworthy if you need
to do some damage asap!
It's pretty good for bossmobs though. Just pumping out those rains and
getting no summons is worth a few resists now and then ;).

Mala is the only unresistable debuff we get, unlike shamans who get 2 (and
both better then ours).
Mala is most often used in smaller guilds who don't have shaman with Malo or
Malos. Mala gives you that edge to debuff a mob which seemingly resists
everything else.

Mala is like all other buffs in that line overwritten by the rest of that
line that debuff more. Considering Mala only debuffs for 35 it is probably
overwritten by Malosi /ni /a right after. It's the whole point of the
unresistables to get a mob's resists down just enough to stick a better
debuff.

Don't use it for exping. The manacost is not worth it.

Monster Summoning 3 was left out of the GV upgrades a while ago, so it is a
lvl 60 version of the "funspell" which you got at level 50. Sorry.
MS pets also only cast O'Keills radiation as far as I know, which is a ds,
but a very very small one and not close to Fire Pet DS. 50+ fire pets are
crappy wizards and basically useless btw :)

Good nuke. Firebolt next level is double the damage, but the Line of Sight
problem is highly annoying so I kept sofb memmed next to it anyway.

Ancients only drop from a couple of mobs and are No Drop. Do not expect to
get these (ever) if you're not in a raiding guild. And even then most
raiding guilds don't do the places these spells drop.

Wind was added because we simply only had 1 PBAE worth something. Now we can
chain them. Usefull when clearing trash on raids, or in PBAE groups.
At times when you use PBAE, mana is generally not an issue.. at all.

TER is very rare and has a worse ratio then both the 52 and the 64 heals.
The reason most mages want it anyway is so we can chain 2 heals to keep our
pets alive (either 52 + 60 or at level 64 the 64 + 60). Yes our heals suck
atm, and dev's are looking into it (at least, that's what they promised).

AFAIK it only drops from like 2 or 3 mobs (raidmobs) and can be researched
with components which drop once every blue moon.

I got mine for 500pp from someone who didn't understand what he was selling,
my guild only had 1 drop of it which was on a Grieg kill. Mostly sold for
10k+ which is only worth it if you solo a lot and use heals to keep your pet
alive.

Grats on 60 again :)
60 is easy, it's like 1/4th of the exp you needed for lvl 59.
