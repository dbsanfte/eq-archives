Cool!  So I can hire some programmers and graphics artists to make up
some "artist's conceptions" of gameplay and a login program that takes
credit card info.  Put that paragraph in my EULA.  Ship some disks, and
charge 250,000 people $15 apiece on day 1.  Then on day 2 I can claim
the game lacks all features and content beyond the signup program,
discontinue it, and point to the line about users having no monetary
interest.  Then I retire to a beach in Tahiti with my $37 million.

Just because it's in the contract doesn't mean it's legal.  Companies
will load the fine print with whatever nonsense they think they can
scare you into believing whether it is legally enforceable or not.
They count on intimidation to keep it from ever being challenged.
