Sneak at level 1, hide at 3.

At level 3, your skills are capped at 15, which means you'll fail about 95%
of the time.  You can keep hitting it until it works, of course, but you'll
need a safe zone in to do it, and you won't be able to break hide out in
the field, which means no looting or spell casting, mainly.

At around level 20 they both stop failing entirely, at that point you can
drop into a hot zone in like Howling Stones without invis with relative
safely (you'll need a low lag connection, and a little luck with the goo
spawns though).

There's a level-based component to aggro ranges and whether hide works on
any particular mob.  You'll be good through most low and mid level areas,
through CoM and Guk I'd say, but any 50+ dungeon, Karnors on, will be a
deathtrap if your rogue is under 40.  And even then, until he's mid 50s,
expect to leave a lot of corpses lying around.

Wood elves get racial sneak, halfings get both sneak and hide.  They're
born with a skill of 50, so they improve your failure rates without the
trouble of leveling to ten.

A Brell worshipping rogue (dwarf, halfling or gnome), will not be kos to
the see invis mobs in the Hole, which comes in handy.

Nope.

Nope.
