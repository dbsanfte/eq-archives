First couple times I grouped in the planes I seemed to have a tradition of
doing something stupid.  Accidentally gating back out in POJ, getting lost,
going to wrong gate etc... but the best one was in PON.

We ran out to the Safe Rock area and got ready to go.  I misunderstood
something that was said and I thought we were moving to a different camp so
when the Paladin ran off I followed him.  Then I see a group tell "Where's
the shaman?"  Paladin answers "Well, she's here with me for some reason"
Then I realize that I followed the Paladin out as he was pulling.  Man did I
feel stupid.
