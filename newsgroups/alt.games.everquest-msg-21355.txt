About a week ago a level 2 SK in Field of Bone asked my necro to help
him find his corpse.  I cast Locate Corpse several times and it kept
zeroing in on one that was in the path leading to the guards, but he
said that wasn't the corpse he was looking for (he apparently had
another corpse with what I assume had more stuff on it).  I told him
to go ahead and loot the corpse in the path anyway, as hopefully I
could find his other corpse once the corpse in the path was looted.
Then the poor guy kept getting jumped by wolf pups and wolf cubs while
trying to loot that corpse and I wound up helping him fight them off
so he wouldn't have a *third* corpse!  Finally, after he looted the
corpse in the road, I cast Locate Corpse again and it pointed to
another corpse he had off by one of the hills, which was the corpse
that he was looking for.  

Anyway, I'm just wondering exactly how the Locate Corpse spell works
on a player with multiple corpses in the zone; does it locate the
corpse that is closest by or the corpse that is the most recent?  

Thanks in advance,
