Well, the new kinder gentler SoE just might, if, and when you get a 
response to a petition.  In the past I would have said no way they would do 
that.  Impossible to say where the problem actually was that caused you to 
LD, could have been something on your side, somewhere on the route to SoE, 
or at SoE.  Personally, I'd get a rez from a cleric, loot up, and go regain 
that xp you lost, probably faster than worrying about a customer service 
rez.
