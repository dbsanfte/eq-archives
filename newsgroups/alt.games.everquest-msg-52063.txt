Yep this is the main problem for eq tradeskills . 6 ac 65 hp rings are not
even near the best ring item they are just easier to find. Useable
tradeskill equipment is all that is needed . A ac 30 bp would be just fine
for fine steel plate . ac 14 just dosent cut it . The problem with smithing
is that the result is too useless.

The high end tailoring is sorta usefull . The componets needed to gather
skill and make the high end items is ridiculous though. I figure to run
tailoring up to the required skill would require killing several thousand
wyverns just for the skins. The rare oil and tannins though can only be
gathered or foraged in zones where it is kinda hard to do anything else. The
problem with tailoring is it is to hard to get skill and to hard to gather
componets.

Baking is sorta a nifty skill but the result has to have far more of an
effect . I do almost exclusively dine on frost giant steaks though. bridge
recipes required . Baking might actually be the second best tradeskill.

pottery only usefull for thurgadin vapors.
