You dont need a trivial guide. The baking is CHEAP to learn, so here is my
easiest guide to get baking to 135 skill:

Head to EC; buy XX stacks of Frosting from the baking vendor at Inn 1.  Head to
Inn 4, buy as many batwings from the vendor there. Mix 1 bat wing, 1 frosting in
a spit untill trivial (42 or 45, cant remember).
If near Inn 4, buy batwings, if not, head to WFP, buy a lot of batwings in the
Mage guild. Head to EFP and buy as many fish in the building you have to pass
through to get down to the docks.
Mix 1 batwing and 1 fish in a spit untill 135 skill.
Dont worry about failures, the "expensive" fish rolls cost 1pp for 1 stack of
material. I got baking to 135 in 2 hours and around 80pp, thats including
running time to get the materials.

Then you need foraged stuff to make pies (fruit, vegetable, berries) till 142
skill.
Then its brownie parts and dragon meat untill you reach a trivial value, noone
knows what that is yet.
