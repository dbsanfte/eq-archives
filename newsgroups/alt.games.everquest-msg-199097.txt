There is a temple just south of the Wizzy/Druid ports in Dreadlands - its
full of skellies that you can pull singly even if they are right next to
each other (they aren't very social hehe) I hunted there with my beast from
44 to 50 at 49 or so you start to get a few light blues but the majority are
still dark blue. Grab some KEI and/or a partner and you are good to go man
