That's my complaint, too.  When you are selling a service, you should
give customers a few months, not a few days, notice that you are
changing the service to be incompatible with their equipment, when
that equipment met the advertised specificications when they bought
the service.

I also don't think, in general, that any game should *require* the
latest DirectX.  Historically, games that use DirectX N have sometimes
had compatiblity problems with DirectX N+1.  E.g., when EQ moved to DX
7, some people tried DX 8, and found it would not work.  Many had no
problem, of course, but a fair number did...and Verant's position was
that EQ did not support DX 8.  Now, imagine if some *other* game you
were playing then required 8  Install 8 for that game, and lose EQ, or
give up on that game to keep EQ?
