When I started my wizard, it didn't seem to make a damned bit of
difference for anything beneficial, and was nothing but a roleplaying
reason to have more of a PITA in certain factions situations. (Same for
most classes, though it was far more evident on my troll warrior.) 
However, of late a lot of stuff has been added that's diety specific.
Sol Ro is the true god of the wizards, and his followers do get some
bennies in armor availability, INT items, quests, etc.

It's not a show stopper, but if I had it to do over again, I'd go with
the Burning Prince in a heartbeat.
