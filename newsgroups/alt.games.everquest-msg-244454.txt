Test devs put in a new front end today (the login screen etc); I
imagine you all will see it pretty soon. Well something else got added
in that wasn't supposed to be there....

Logging into test atm can strip you of all your flags and aa.

Dying has been "enhanced". One person I know died and lost *fifteen
levels* from 65 to 50.

You have to admit, EQ would be a lot more challenging if flags and aas
were "no rent" and dying knocked you fifteen levels backwards. Send it
live!
