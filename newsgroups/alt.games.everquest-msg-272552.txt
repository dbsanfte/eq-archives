My comment was based on 5 years of watching them try to balance

With the way that the higher level expansions were set up (PoP, GoD,
OOW), whole zones where off limit to groups that didn't have a
warrior. Sure you could exp there but you didn't have a shot at the
loot because an equivalent Pally/SK couldn't tank the named. Your only
choice, if you had a regular group that didn't include a warrior, was
to wait for a few more levels till the knights could tank it. 

I do agree that warriors were underpowered in older content.

No, but those encounters were always at the leading edge of the curve.


If you wanted to do the hard content and didn't have uber gear, you
needed someone who could pull singles (because nobody but a plate tank
could take a hit), you needed a cleric (more for Rez than healing) and
you needed a warrior if you wanted to hunt the named. 

I grouped almost exclusively with friends in EQ so never had the
luxury of choosing classes. We took whoever showed up and went from
there. The fact that that locked us out of the content was something I
never appreciated about EQ. We'll just have to disagree on that point.

WoW seems to have a better grip on this than EQ did. I can't speak for
EQ2, haven't played it yet. 

WoW only has 9(?) classes but they're radically different (at least
the ones I've played so far) . Having a warrior or a paladin as your
main tank in a group means that the whole dynamic of your group
changes. Warriors can hold agro on multiple mobs so you can take a
main-tank/healer approach to battles. Paladins can't hold agro worth a
damn so if you try that approach, your healer will get smooshed on
every big pull due to heal agro from multiple mobs. That cost our main
healer a lot of deaths until we went back to the drawing board on what
tactics to use. 

It calls for a total change in tactics but it doesn't lock you out of
content because you don't have the right classes in your group. Then
again, I'm only mid 30s so that might change at the high end, it's too
early to tell at this point. What I do know is that they learned from
some of the obvious mistakes in EQ. There don't seem to be any spells
with the scalability problems of slow or Complete Heal. There isn't
any type of lull or feign pulling. There are a couple of classes that
can do crowd control but nobody can lock down more than one mob with a
mez type spell. If you mez/sap a 2nd mob, the first one automatically
breaks free. 

Honestly, I don't think we disagree too much on this (with the
exception of my lack of faith in SOE <g>). I love having to develop or
adapt tactics and play style based on group makup, I just hate being
locked out of any content because I won't boot a friend from a group
to grab whatever class the developer decided should be required for an
encounter.
