Very small bazaar overview (how to get there, basic use) for ya:

The bazaar is in Luclin (moon expansion).  It is off the Nexus and off of
Shadowhaven.  The best way to get to it is to get a port to Nexus, or stand
in one of the spires that has a Nexus Scion and hail them, they'll say a
phrase, say back to them whatever it is they want you to say.. I believe
it's something like "I wish to journey to luclin", with [journey to luclin]
being the key words.  Then you'll receive a little gem thingy (gem thingy is
a highly technical term, so use it carefully), and wait for the spires to
port you to nexus.  Once there, run around along the walls and hail the
guards standing near the hallways.  One of them will say 'behind me leads to
the bazaar', and something spiffy about the bazaar, I can't remember his
exact phrasing.  Run down that hallway, to your right is a port to Eastern
Waste, I believe, and to your left is the zoneline to bazaar.  Enter the
bazaar, find a wall, face it (you'll be getting lagged, I suggest turning
graphics and clip plane down before entering), sit down, and type /bazaar.
A window will pop up, and you can enter your characters information, and a
'slot', hit the 'submit' or whatever button, and a list of items will come
up that are being sold.  It will have the item, the seller, it's cost.  you
can click on items to see their stats, etc.  If you right click on the
traders name next to the item in the list, you'll point towards him (stand
up before you do this).. run forward, if you run into a wall, run around it,
and right click again, then keep running forward.. repeat until you find the
trader.  Use them just like you would use a normal merchant (can't sell
stuff to them, though).  Ok.. that should get you to the bazaar, hope you
find a good weapon.

BTW, at level 4, not sure if you have noticed, but willo-wisps and such
can't be hit by non-magical weapons.. that's why the person before said buy
a magical weapon.  Willo wisps are nice things to slaughter, and they can
drop lightstones and greater lightstones.. which are useful, can be sold to
merchants, or you can use them to do a quest (can't remember who you turn
them into, though).

Ok, enjoy, slaughter well, and don't die.

PS - what server are you on?
