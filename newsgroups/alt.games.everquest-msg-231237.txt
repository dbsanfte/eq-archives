RL and family > ALL.  While I haven't guit the game,I *DID* take a three 
or four month break a while back.  My daughter was pretty sick (noting 
life threatening, just sick alot) and couldn't seem to get over it.  I 
quit playing so I could help take care of her more and just BE with 
her...too hold her hand while she slept, if nothing else.  

And again, 6 months ago, I took some time away from the game when my son 
was born.  Granted, these are not the same as the situation here, but 
they are RL happenings that I am grateful to have dropped EQ for.  

It's been pointed out here (many times) that EQ is a *GAME*...RL is 
ALWAYS more important.  And, while I may mor may not have truly quit the 
game in this instance and given away gear, the sentiment would have been 
the same.  To the OP:  GL, godspeed, and may you and your son have a 
glorious time together in getting your time prioritized.  Fam is more 
important than the game.  And I agree with the idea of grabbing a copy of 
EQ for your son (I assume he's old enough to be ableto play with some 
help?) and the two of you can level a new character together for some 
together-time and fun.  Of course, that's after you've spent one on one 
time with him for a while!

Any way...Gratz on the "DING", and hope and pray that all goes well.  
Have a good time, eh?
