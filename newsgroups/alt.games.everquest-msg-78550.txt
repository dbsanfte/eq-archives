>>> I was wondering if there is a website out there with descriptions of
each classes epics and what you do to get them....<<<

http://interealms.com/ranger/guides/allfaquests.html

No pictures unfortunately, and not much in the way of descriptions ... but
does give directions on how to complete all known epics, including any
necessary sub-quests.
