If you've taken more than a couple weeks off, it should be natural to
check the patch history to see if there have been any others between
the one you just downloaded and the last time you played. Usually,
however, the eqnews.txt will hold the last 2 or 3 patch messages
anyway. If you've been gone long enough to have missed more than that,
then it should be obvious there have been other patches you've
missed...
