Yeah....how about when youre a druid and join a group and  the
expectation is (and rightly so) that you should immediatly sow
everyone in the group. I do this but a lot of groups are already
engaging mobs so my first thing it to sow, buff and DS the MA then sow
the rest of the group. What freaks me out is that sometimes a good
while later I see a group member mezz an add. Then i think
"wow....wheres the breeze/clarity?" The first thing my chanter does is
breeze new group members so why do i constantly have to beg for it
even in a group when im a druid? Maybe there are so many druids
(especially the halfling ones) that people must consider us as
expendable as tissue paper. Use one and just pull another out of the
box.


Oh, and after i posted this i thought it would be better for people,
if they feel the need to add "crack" to the game, to refer it to the
Lich spell. I think its much more applicable because it has deadly
consequences. First it gives an extreme high (best mana regen), it has
a deleterious effect on your health and will eventually kill you if
you dont stop, and when youre on it you end up having to do violent
things to other creatures (Lifetap mobs) in order to keep taking it.
