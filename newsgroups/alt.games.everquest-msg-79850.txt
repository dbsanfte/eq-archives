Maybe sebilis is empty on your server, but during peak times on Prexus,
getting from zonein to uzo isn't generally tough (saying you'd never make it
through alive certainly isn't true for Prexus)

If theres a necro group, or a uzo group, or a disco group recently broke in,
the run to UZO is trivial.  With SoW it doesn't matter what mobs are up (and
also now with innate run 3) unless your incredibly unlucky, and get stunned
by every mob along the way :)
