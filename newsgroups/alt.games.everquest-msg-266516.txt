Here's how teamspeak works in general:

Someone with access to lots of bandwidth sets up a server. A cable user, 
or someone on a real bandwidth connection, such as a T1. Ours is hosted 
on a box at our local ISP. (Which I happen to work at). You can set that 
up on your personal machine if it's possible for people to connect to 
your machine from out on the net (i.e. you don't have an iron clad 
firewall or unmanageable NAT boundry in the way).

Every person that wants to be able to communicate on the teamspeak 
server needs the client. They will connect to the server. Depending on 
how the server is setup, they may need a pre-existing account (ours is 
that way). They can then join channels, make channels if allowed, etc. I 
found it all pretty straight forward, but then I'm a webmaster/sysadmin.

Another  important thing (explained on the teamspeak site) is the codec 
to use on the channel...
We have to use a very low bitrate codec because 2 of our peeps are on 
dialup, and slow dialup at that.

I find it works best with an active noise cancelling headset... I got 
one from Radio Shack last year sometime... it was on out of production 
clearance though. It has two microphones, one on the boom in front of my 
mouth, and one on a little dohicky that sets on the desk. It tends to 
tamp down any noise the one on the desk can hear, so I can keep using my 
speakers (it's a headset mike, not mike and headphones) and play my 
music, listen to the radio, whatever.

Also good would be a headset/headphones combo.

Worst option is normal speakers and a cheap desk microphone... you will 
get feedback and echos, and it will pick up everything. If you are in 
voice activated mode, every time there's a loud noise in game everyone 
will hear it (a second or so later) garbled through their teamspeak.

(We got a guy that has the headset without noise cancelling... but his 
sensitivity is too high. Everytime someone speaks, we hear echoed (and 
generally not understandable)from him too.)
