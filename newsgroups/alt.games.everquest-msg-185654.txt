  Where exactly is here?  This thing is crossposted to the entire 
known universe.
  What exactly is "good" about Bush's job?  The destruction of the
economy by his war talk?  The alienation of almost all his allies to
destoy a foe that is not a threat?  The creation of thousands of new
recruits for Al-Quaeda?  The neglect of the war on terror for the war
of error?  What exactly is the brilliant move he made that got your 
admiration?
