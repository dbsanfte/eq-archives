Went there by accident clicking back to surefall.

lvl range on the mobs is about 20-35 or so prolly.

Took my 21 necro, frogs were db, and everything else was even and up. My 45  
ranger saw a few dbs pumas, most was lb and green.

Didn't see any faction on anything, and I think I killed every mob type
in the zone.

This looks like it'll be a nice zone to hunt in, except currently mobs give
NO experience whatsoever. The necro killed 2 dbs 1 even and a yellow and 
his exp bar didn't move at all. Got the "you gain experience!" message but 
nothing visible.
