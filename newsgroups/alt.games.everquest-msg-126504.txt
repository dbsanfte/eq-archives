I'm guessing that spell level some how effects fizzel rate ?
Also do you think that casting skill effects resists or only fizzels ?
There seems to be some equation based on <casting skill> / <Max possible
skill> that means that you get more resists & fizzels immediatly after
leveling. 
This seems to be even worse when you have just got a new spell level and
try to cast your new spells.

Are there any reliable stats on the web anywhere ?
