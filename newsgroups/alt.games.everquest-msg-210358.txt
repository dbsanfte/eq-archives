I reached my goal of tanking in teir 2 a lot sooner than anticipated, and
did it in a duo with no down time, no less!

Nothing to get tooo excited about, though, since this was the dillo/desert
camp in PoS, and I've been told that these fellers are the weakest
around.  

Just to be sure tho...are there any other Teir 2 camps that are similar,
or only marginally tougher?  We can take on a little tougher stuff, it
just requires that we introduce the Dreaded Down Time.  

The frogs can be aggro-kited, I know, but running away from mobs isn't my
idea of a good time.  My ideal situation is to be able to have a slow duo
going whilst keeping the LFG tag up for getting into a Teir 3 group. Since
there are two of us LFG, it takes a little longer than otherwise to get a
group.
