Coming from somebody in the business of the language *grin*, actually
it's a bit more drastic than that. At that rate of change, the language
would have only changed about twenty percent since the sixteen hundreds.
Take a look at some original fifteenth centruy documents from England

speaker today, and in some cases totally incomprehensible.
