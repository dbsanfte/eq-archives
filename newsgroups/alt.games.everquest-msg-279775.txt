Ok... lets run with that... hell... for shits and giggles lets triple 
your numbers and round up and call it an even 4000 instead of 1250 
raiders. (Yeah... I'm feeling generous, and I'm waiting for my mana to 
regen so I don't have that much time so I'm being lazy with my 
arithmetic.)

Next lets multiply by 25 servers. (Includes test, zek, FV, and legends): 
100,000 raiders.

Now... according to mmorpg charts eq as of july 2005 is holding at 
450,000 accounts, subtract out 100k, and thats 350k nonraiders or 3.5:1.

Raiders don't make a quarter of the subscriber base. And that's more 
than tripling your estimate of how many raiders they're are. Granted 
there are some prepaid accounts that are inactive, etc. 

But its going to take some pretty creative accounting to take your 
estimate, or even my exceedingly generous one to get to a point where 
raiders outnumber non raiders.

As far as the 450k cited by mmorpg charts. I think its generally 
accepted to be in the right ball park. They specificlally claim their 
confidence in the EQ number is high.

Valid point. EQ2/WoW appealed to and uprooted EQ players (and guilds) at 
all stages of the game, not just the '1-groupers'... whether or not they 
landed on their feet in WoW/EQ2 and are still playing notwithstanding. 
The churn was felt at all levels of play.

It lacks the depth and complexity of the raid game. And that lack is 
totally unneccessary. There is no reason there can't be a lot more 
scripted one group 'events' with more character than a creator or ldon 
run. Especially now that we have all the tools to prevent 'raid' zerging 
of what is supposed to be 'difficult for one group but is inherently 
trivial for 50 people.

And the gear, perhaps, needs to be a touch better. (They don't have to 
give it away... it can be HARD... I -like- it hard. It just shouldn't be 
mind numbingly tedious.)

Once a week, a lucky guild would have a turn at clearing naggy or vox. 
For the time in between we lined up in Guk and SolB. Literally, lined 
up.

Raiding was an occasional event at best, for even the most 'uber' of us.

I've single grouped everything in lowerguk in SolRo armour at 50th 
level. Of course at the time, finding a mob to kill was the challenge ;)

SolB is a bit rougher. The imps like to come in small packs but could be 
mezzed, and the fire giants were *impossible* to single pull other than 
FD splits, so you needed a 'decent' group for that... ideally with a 
good monk puller. (heh... could have been you... :)

Multi-group 'raids' were common for the reasons you state, but totally 
unneccesary, outside of the dragons (which could take literally months 
to get in on a kill), and later the planes... and now much later most 
anything actually worth killing for loot ;)
