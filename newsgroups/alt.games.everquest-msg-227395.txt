But everyone "needs" cash.  Need, in NBG terms, is understood to mean 
"will use rather than sell".  People who say Need when others are 
passing, and then sell the item, are being dishonest.  If everyone 
passes, in a NBG, then all roll for the item to sell.  When that 
happens, you know you have an honest group, or at least those in the 
group who -could- have laid claims on the item but didn't are honest... 
or to really put a bad face on it, didn't think the item was good enough 
to trade the goodwill of the group away just yet.
