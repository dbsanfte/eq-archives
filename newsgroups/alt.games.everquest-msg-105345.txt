Speaking from experience with my own twinked Enchanter...  this is not
exactly true.  Having 8 characters on one server, a Warrior, Druid, cleric,
Enchanter, Rogue, Bard, Ranger and a Beastlord.  Healing for a Warrior,
yes, it is long, but then, medding and healing for an enchanter is about as
long too.  My twinked enchanter, outfitted with tailor made silk armor with
some stuff, like the robe of the Oracles, gator scale sleeves, rings for
int and such...  It didn't help much with the 'increase' of options.  I
still have to depend on people to help me more than I did with my twinked
melee.
