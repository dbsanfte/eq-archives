That's just the thing. I made the website for me, not anyone else, and I 
don't get paid. So I really don't care if people leave or not. I don't 
quite understand why you don't just not visit it and forget about it. 
Instead you chose to come on here and piss and moan about poor you, you 
have to deal with pop-up windows, I'm so stupid, blah blah blah. Well if 
I'm so stupid then why do you want to visit /my/ website? If you /don't/ 
want to visit my website then why are you complaining about the pop-up 
windows for ie users?
