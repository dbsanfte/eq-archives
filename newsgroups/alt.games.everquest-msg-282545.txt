Realizing full well this thread has grown a bit stale:

It's funny. Over the weekend my wife logged in for the first time since
the day BEFORE the patch. She was not logged in except as a bazaar
merchant from the day after the patch fiasco to the rollbacks, and as
such made no purchases during that time. The day BEFORE the patch, she
had bought a few underpriced (Woops, that one's missing a zero!) items,
and gave my iksar necro a set of experts armor. She got rolled back,
losing 20K in plat, the underpriced items she had legitemately
purchased the day BEFORE the patch, and got back all the experts armor
she had given me. My necro, however, was not rolled back and still has
the experts armor. I WAS playing my main the day of the patch, and was
not hit by a single rollback. So it almost seems like the rollbacks
were random.

While she feels double XP weekend isn't quite an appropriate tradeoff
for two days of legitemate transactions for a measly hour of rampant
tradeskilling, and to a goodly extent I agree, we did take full
advantage of it.

Xiphos - SOE, if you read this, the correct answer was acknowledge you
made a mistake, and just let it go. But thanks for playing.
