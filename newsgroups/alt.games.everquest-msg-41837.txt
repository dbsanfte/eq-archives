Thanx Chilout, an excellent analysis, and so much more refreshing than 
the patriotic feminist drivel we here so often.  I like Israel, but it's 
high time we take a close look at our involvement there.  I have a 
solution too.  Israel gets to keep their little country and the Muslims 
get the Temple mount.  Or the Muslims can get the country and Israel can 
keep the Temple Mount.  Simple eh?

As for oil and defending Saudi Arabia, it's time we can both.
