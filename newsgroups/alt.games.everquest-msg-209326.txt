No, it's not that. I've just noticed many instances of root breaking on 
the first swing of a pet attacking a rooted mob. Subsequent hits don't 
seem to have a chance to break root that's distinguishable from root 
breaking naturally. Of course, as I said, it could well be my 
imagination.

Besides that, while I'm very familiar with root breaking on the first 
tick, I think I've also seen it break between the first and the fifth 
tick too, especially on high-MR mobs. I don't think I have developed a 
feeling that I have 30 seconds of grace after the first six, and I think 
I'm quite well attuned to Druid roots. :)
