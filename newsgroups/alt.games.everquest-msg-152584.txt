Well, let's see, our dumb one is almost 3 years old now.  He chews on rocks,
wood works too.  He will eat anything at all that you give him.  He loves
cucumbers fresh out of the garden, preferable picked by his mother after she
crawls under the fence.  Green tomatoes fresh out of the garden are tasty
too.  Carrots and beans are pretty good as well.  And, of course, there is
just nothing quite like fresh mowed grass.
