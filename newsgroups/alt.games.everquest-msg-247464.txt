WRONG!!!!! A CUSL2 is an Intel 815E series chipset.

ATI themselves realize there is a problem. They have a specific
checklist to run through to try and resolve the problem. It is not the
video card in my opinion as the problem seems to be pretty widespread
over many ATI cards and only ATI cards. Smells like a driver problem to
me. I neither like nor hate ATI cards, or any card for that matter, in
the same sense that I neither like nor hate a screwdriver. If the tool
doesn't do the job, time for a new tool. 3 different ATI cards, 3
different systems, all the same problem. The card? Not likely. A
particular motherboard, not likely as well, 3 different chipsets. DX9?
Possibly. ATI drivers? Also possible as they are the only common
denominator.

Quite possibly, I bought the Ti-4200 as it was cheap and my FX5950 in my
main system works with liveable glitches that also seem to change with
each driver update.

Now wouldn't they work just peachy on an Intel chipset!
