From EQ2 chat;

GMGrog: ... back.   I'll explain what I know about what happened for
those that haven't heard.

Manev: Norpan, there is no ETA about the servers coming up.  My
apologies for the inconvenience.

GMGrog: (It's 8:24am PST now for time reference to your own time
zone.)    Yesterday at 7:00am servers went down briefly, usually
morning reset.  They came back up at 7:30am and folks logged in...

GMGrog: Players logging in or after zoning a few times found their
quest journal was empty.  (Not everyone but very many.)

GMGrog: The recipe books were empty, spells were missing like Call of
Qeynos/Overlord or Orc Master Strike.

GMGrog: They brought the servers back down at 10:00am.  They'd been up
for 2.5 hours.

Manev: Thanks for the information Duvaries. Our development team
working on it.

GMGrog: Devs, ops, programmers, all were working on the problem by
them already.

GMGrog: The servers have been down since.  They've made progress,
servers are up internally now being tested.  They still don't have an
hard time for when the servers will be back up.

GMGrog: They rolled everything back to 7:00am PST before the servers
reset.  That means anyone that was online, the things that happened
during the 2.5 hour up time are gone as if they didn't happen.

GMGrog: They know how frustrating this very long wait is.  They'll be
wiping all exp debt and giving free play time.  They haven't explained
that "free time" in detail yet, but will once everything is back on
track.

GMGrog: That's pretty much all I know.

GMGrog: (cut & pasting that to save it because I keep typing all that
out every 30 mins or so...)
