As someone has mentioned earlier, we are not aware of all intelligence
data on the subject. It *has* been confirmed that Hussein provides aid
to the families of those who are killed carrying out terrorist acts.
This, I'm certain, is not the complete scope of his ties to terrorism
which are illuminated in other intelligence data.

The best way to deal with terrorism is to dissuade it. Make the
backlash not worth the satisfaction gained from a terrorist act.
