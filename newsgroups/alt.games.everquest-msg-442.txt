    I had some druid nut get all bent out of shape yesterday when I was
hunting
grizzly. He went one a rant that he wouldn't heal me in the future, and told
others not to cause I was killing bears. I don't care what you want to play,
role-playing wise, but don't expect me not to take advantage of the
experience benefit of soloing grizzlies. Then he challenged me to a duel to
the death, but he was playing anonymous like I'm going to be that stupid. It
is just a game, lighten up. I soloed  for the first time yesterday, a
grizzly ,  a willowisp and a adult male lion at level 10. Monks rock.
    By the way does anyone know if you can get credit for turning in burnout
light stones? And who is it that takes them anyway? I think I remember
someone saying there was a lady in the gypsy camp that would give great
experience points for them.
