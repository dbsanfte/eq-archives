OK, I'm gonna put too much thought into this.  Just for fun.  Warning: as I
have a prediliction to do, I wander a bit off topic in the first paragraph.

If Luclin always has the same side in the light, then what you can say about
its motion is that its rotational period is exactly equal to the period of
its orbit around Norrath, adding or subtracting exactly the angular change
in Norrath's position relative to whatever star it orbits (depending on
whether Luclin orbits Norrath in the same direction as Norrath orbits its
sun, or in the opposite direction).  This behavior has not yet been observed
in real life, and probably never will be for reasons ever further outside
the scope of matters Everquest than the things I've written so far.  You can
also say that Luclin's rotation relative to Norrath is retrograde relative
to its orbit around Norrath -- a rare enough phenomenon in our own solar
system, but known to occur, although I'm not sure if any scientific
explanation I've read to date satisifes the "why" of it.

The first sentence in the above paragraph is part of the answer, as far as I
can tell.  Units of time are a useful abstraction for breaking up an even
lengthier process into manageable chunks.  It may seem like I am merely
stating the obvious here, but time of day is the convention adopted for
breaking up a day.  But how you define a day on any moon can be open to some
debate.

Would it be the rotational period of the moon?  In that case, /time may as
well give a random number, as it will only have relevance to time on Norrath
in a manner that even the Gnomes and Erudites could be forgiven for not
having figured out yet.  Or would a day on Luclin be the length of time it
takes from sunrise to sunrise for example?  In this case, /time should
always return an exact value on Luclin, which would only vary between zones,
but remain forever constant within a given one.

I realise none of this deals with the Lower Guk question, or with the fact
that there are no time zones on Norrath itself.  But I would have never
thought of it as a nerf myself.

Man!  I'm gonna have to do some serious drinking as penance on the weekend
for all this spew I just made.  Just kidding.
