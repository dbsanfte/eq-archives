I have an iksar monk who doesn't want to hurt any of the gnomes in sol b,
and I was wondering if it was possible to get good faction with them (or at
least dubious)? Are they on the faction that is improved by killing meldrath
the mindlessly malignant?

I was thinking about working towards a tinkers bag sometime, but I don't
want to hurt any good factions as I roleplay that way.
