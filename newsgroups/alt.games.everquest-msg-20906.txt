Hmm, My expell summoned does only 210 max, so by my calculation I was
getting 10 more damage for 10 less mana making it more efficient.  I have
been using it for the last month or so while periodically hunting in The
Hole.  The stun component had the added benefit of keeping the elementals
from double attacking for 100+ on the group and doing the damage, thereby
saving me heal mana as well.  Was just a thought.

BTW, the hole is an AWSOME spot for exp.  At 48-52 just right inside zone
can be great. and if you are feeling brave you can drop down to the
courtyard area and handle it with a 'chanter and get exp at 54 and 55 still.

Ok, My typical group is this:

Monk
'chanter
Warior
Mage
Druid
Me (cleric)

I usually run the following spellsc in most group settings:
1- Celestial heal
2- Remedy (you would probably have SH here)
3- Complete heal
4- Divine Aura
5- What ever the name of the second invulnerability spell is
6-Stun spell (usually force shock)
7-Stun spell (usually force)
8-(reserved for hot swap of spells)

Celestial heal- awsome spell, cant say enough about it! wish it cast faster
but then it would be too good.

Remedy- You dont have it yet, but it should replace your SH when you get it.
It casts faster and heals more.  I dont care about efficiency here -- Once i
got this spell the problem i had with casters dying to BIG (not Uber) mobs
once they took the aggro was gone.  GH doesnt heal enough to keep em alive
and the 0.9 sec more that Sup Heal took to cast was sometimes (usually)
about  half a sec to long.

Complete heal- I preach (no pun intended) aggro management in a group
setting.  If you can keep the aggro on the tank(s), everyone lives.  If you
have to start healing non-tanks (yes - rangers are in this catagory) you
start spending mana fast.  Complete heal is the most mana efficient spell we
have..moreso when used on a fully buffed TANK.  I consantly remind my group
to slow down casting and let the melee classes do damage..pepper that with
frequent mana reports as they draw the aggro and they begin to see the
logic.

Divine Aura and the other spell --- Life savers, especially with the hate
list wipe.  I strongly recommend that you keep em both up.  If you arent
hunting in places where you use 'em occasionally, then you arent hunting to
you maximum group potential.

The two stun spells-  Use what ever is getting resisted less (and I
sometimes put up a third). Mostly used for stunning something attacking a
non-tank, casters casting AE spells, and chain cast only when we are
fighting mobs that gate (and then when they are in that health region when
they attempt to gate).  Usefull with a 'chanter in the group since they have
a few more secs to get off a mesmerize spell.

Open spell slot, normally heroic bond (now) but use it for swap out buffs,
and situational attack/safety spells.

For travel I usually leave up the lowest of my memorized stun spells -- toss
up enstill and atone (or a damage spell if I can solo in the zone).

That is my normal group hunt spell lineup- indoors or out.  Multi-group and
raids are lined up on a case by case basis but the first 5 slots are
permanent.
