Never buy armor from a vendor.

I presume the iron leggings have the plate look?

The aforementioned gatorscale leggings for leather look, rygorr for
chain look (sebilite scale is also chain, but they're more towards the
high end). I am working on the assumption that you want to avoid plate
look leggings.

No. You also can't wear robes.
On the bright side, chain tunics look great on you, and have a kind of
short 'skirt' with Luclin models turned on. I had female dwarf luclin
models turned on one day and saw a female dwarf in a bloodstained
tunic (and I think plate leggings); it looked really nice on her.
