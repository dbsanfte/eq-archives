HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA

i play on fennin . . . have for some time, too

our GM left us about 1 1/2 mo ago . .. namdarie the mousehearted (little
gnome, big heart)

we've got this new guy . . i met him in his first week when vox got plooted
. . seemed very nice

i'm thinking off hand you can find him most easily on weekends, usually
latenight (PST), when everyone else is bugging him too


our guides though are actually really, really lazy . . not identifying
themselves, playing dumb, never forwarding info

i reported that last archery exploit, and the guides were like "well that's
supposed to happen . . possibly"

/vent off (i know, i know, dealing with tons of mental gnomes can wear off /
piss you off)


so i'm posting this because i know the name "curism" . . . email me with
some time you want to meet ingame, and i'll hook you up, just in case they
give you your wiz back (can't have nekked wizards, can we?)

~chris~
i shot the cleric
