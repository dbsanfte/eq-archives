Yes.  There was a wizard in my guild who, even before PoP was announced, had
maxed out Every Single AA Ability.  Yes, he was unemployed, why do you ask?

There were also uberguilds who over the last few months have been
deliberately stocking up on AA points so that they could immediately acquire
the new abilities.  These are the people that particular change was aimed
at.  Some of them had over 100 AA accumulated.
