Do you have any reason to believe so?  Its apparantly been a practice for at least a
year, since I can recall seeing the phrase "box a cleric" in posts at least that far
back... I just didn't realize its true implications at the time.

A nerf would be simple, cut the timer on accepting or turning down a rez to something
much shorter, as I (and most people I've talked to) have always believed was the case.

An alternative would be to make bodies rezable once and only once.   After all, you only
get exp back the once, whats the point of being able to rez them again?

I'll tell you what the point is, its so you can do this.  This suggests to me its not
broken, its working as intended.  After all, why go to all the trouble of making a
special "rez this body and get exp, rez it again and don't get exp" if you don't EXPECT
people to rez them more than once.  Make that flag "rezable/unrezable"  Brell, get rid
of the flag entirely, and just have rez set the timer to zero.

Thats not to say they won't nerf it, nor that they won't decide suddenly that its an
exploit.  After all, the person who originally decided to code rez this way is probably
long since off the project, and the  people who work there now are just as famous for
sudden capricious 90% turns as any Verant employee ever was.

Here's a thought though.  Doing this SUCKS.  It chews down all your mana and eliminates
all your buffs and most of your HP, and slaps a rez icon on you, stripping down half
your stats and making it impossible to land a strength spell on you.  If you suited up
for battle, you probably can't move at all (unless you are a monk)  It also requires
that you have a body available, which means you already died once in the zone... even if
only to a duel, you still already had all your buffs and HP etc. stripped off once.
This isn't a casual endeavor.  Further, that rez costs a bardload of mana... unless you
happen to have a rez stick, which is the only reason this tactic makes any sense for any
but the most serious situations.
