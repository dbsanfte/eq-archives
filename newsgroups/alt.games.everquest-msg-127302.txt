Int casters get channeling at birth. Priests don't get it until about
level 4 or 5. Since they don't get it at level 1, they have to put a
point into it, same with most any skill you get after level 1 (Notable
exceptions being BL's Summon Warder and Bard meditate. Also, I've
found that hybrids only need to train a point in one of their spell
classes to start all of them up.).
