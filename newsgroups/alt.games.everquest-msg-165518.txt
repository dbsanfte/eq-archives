Until someone figured out the Pyzjn spawn, she was deemed to be very rare.  Now 
that it's known, it's been proven that she's just an uncommon spawn ( about 1 
in 4 spawns during the time she can possibly spawn ).

I think the AC is the same - you just have to know the rest of the mobs on his 
table, and if he is also a time-based spawn ( like Pyzjn - only pops between 
8pm and 6am ), you have to kill the PHs at the correct times to maximize a 
chance for him to spawn during his possible time.

I give no merit to the undead guy in the tower or the other crazy ideas.  When 
I look at the non-triggered spawns in the game that I know of, none are like 
that.  None of this "he can only spawn if X mob is down or there are 2 of Y 
mobs in the zone" crap.  Especially old-world mobs when there was very little 
imagination put into standard spawns.

Apparently, the AC used to spawn in the Karanas.  Was there ever word on why he 
was removed from there?
