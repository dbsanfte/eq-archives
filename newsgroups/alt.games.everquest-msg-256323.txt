Nooo not the pink heart of doom!  You are DPS primarily in my opinion, I
reckon Strength of Tunare (ranger) of Spiritual Vigor (beastlord) are more
suited to you.  SoT is most atk, least hp, SV is medium atk, medium hp,
Brells is HP only.  SoT is one hour base iirc.

Spiritual Dominion.  Regens both HP and Mana.

Call of the rathe, adds AC and a small DS, about an hour base.

list.

Spirit of the predator is a ranger atk only buff.  Rangers are hardly
deluded with tells for there buffs, most probably wont mind casting on you
(in fact would probably be shocked at even being asked).

Spell casting reinforcement / extended buffs are not high on  a rangers list
of AA, I have just started to get then (SCR2) at around 200 aa (mainly to
increase the length of haste from my DCotS and Guardian of the Forest AA).
