If by their 'own stupidity and ignorance' you mean 'people with job 
descriptions that do not give them time to religiously study microsoft 
licesensing, and who instead relay on salesreps and consultants to 
advise them the best way to resolve problems then yes.

Of course the consultants and salesreps have little interest in 
providing any solution that fails to maximize billable hours and 
commisions. And even though the buyer is well aware of that he doesn't 
really have much choice in the matter, at least not with grossly 
neglecting his own job.
