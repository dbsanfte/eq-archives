The fact that you didnt die in Erudin is down to the fact you have been
raising faction in the warrens. Kerra Ridge is very good exp but can be
dangerous. Get on  the boat at Erudin and travel to the isle with wisps.
Wisps are good exp and there is also a wrecked ship off the coast with
undead sailors whom also give marvelous exp if ya can break the spawn

If you travel across to Qeynos then you can wander into Qeynos hills and
start killing in Blackburrow or travel furthur in the Karanas
