Yet it seems to me that I have many times logged before a server patch, and
even before a crash and then found myself right where I logged out.

It is also possible that there is some other explanation.  Maybe sometimes
after a server crash (or 'takedown') some saves become unusable forcing the
server to roll you back to a previous save.  To me it seems highly unlikely
that they would *not* code a save on log.  Too many possibilities for
exploits if players could find a way to rollback time.
