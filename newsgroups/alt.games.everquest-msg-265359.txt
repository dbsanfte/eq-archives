1) The designers posted a message in re zones, explaining that they
are still deliberately using them so that they can gain the advantage
of multiple areas using unique tiling.  Thus, they provide areas which
are quite visually different from each other.

2) As to the city zones being small, I assume you've never played EQ1.
Graystone Yards, which is one of the smaller Qeynos city zones, is
about the same size as any one of the three zones making up EQ1's
Qeynos.  EQ1's Qeynos, all 3 zones together, including the newbie area
out front, is less than 1/4 the size of EQ2's Qeynos.

Yeah, so far that system seems like a wash.
