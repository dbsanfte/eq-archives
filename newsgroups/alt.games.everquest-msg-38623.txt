Heya.
 Befallen has indeed returned to its previous stage. A dungeon with three
levels, the 2 first being 2/5 and 6/12.
The third lvl is much more difficult. Going there before 15 means sure
death. And even at 15... oh well. lets say last level is a 15/24ish. At 16,
i definitely recommend Overthere in Kunark. If you are a Dark Elf as i
suspect you will be abble to sell/bank in the outpost. And the beast near
the outpost and the shore give incredible exp. Perhaps one of the best zone
in the game for 16/22 ish, AND you can solo (unlike in a dungeon such as
Bef). The south east of the zone is much higher lvl, around 30/40ish. So
between 22 and 30 i d recommend either South Karanas or Lake of Ill omen.
