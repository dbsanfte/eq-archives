Ok. That sucks.

Blatant lie is overstating the case. The server status page is often not 
up to date, they aren't blatantly lying they're just ineffective at 
communicating.

Lost loot? What lost loot? The loot you 'would have got if the server 
hadn't crashed'? Get real. Seriously.

The game is hosted on multiple physical servers with some zones on 
server A, some on server B, etc. Its possible to reset a single physical 
server. They don't have to bring the entire server farm down in every 
situation.

Or you could beleive it was nefarious GM plot to screw your guild 
alliance out of a raid kill from 6 expansions back...

So your main tank has a sense of humour. :)

That's right. Shit happens. In your case, shit happened. Besides, if 
they started handing out loot every time a server went down their would 
suddenly be a lot of incentive to try and crash the servers.

I know its frustrating, I do empathize with you, but get over it and try 
again. In my opinion you were lucky you got rezzed in a timely manner. 
You lost a couple hours out of your life, but you had fun, and you 
*know* you can do Greig now, so organize and go get him next time. 

Carrying a grudge because they won't generate some free loot, or pop a 
spawn for you is just silly and unproductive.
