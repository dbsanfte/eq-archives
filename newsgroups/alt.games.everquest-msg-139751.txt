    What do you envision yourself doing in EQ?

    If you think you'll play your mage for fun, and one-group dungeon jaunts
or solo activities, Evocation is likely the way to go. The Evocation nukes,
as one goes up, are generally better than the Conjuration ones.

    If you think you'll be a raid mage, your game will be all about
summoning mod rods and casting CotH and Conjuration is the best pick.
