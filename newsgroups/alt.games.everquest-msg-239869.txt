If memory serves me, and looking at the EQ box, the game indeed has a
Teen rating.  To legally own an account on your own you need to be at
least 13 years old.  Mind you, that doesn't matter if you sign yourself
up as an adult at any age, just like how a 16 year old friend of mine
in EQ made it into the Guide program, which "requires" you to be at
least 18 years old.  The EQ Devs also try to make the game play-safe
for everyone, if you notice how they won't do any "rape" stuff or add
in any real kids, because it'd be bad to slaughter the children.
