Yeah. Nothing. Apart from AA skills and all the pretty uber drops in
the
higherup areas of Luclin. AC20 belt? 15/20 hammers? A lot of the items
are pretty much former dragon class, but MUCH easier to get.

Now warriors don't deserve anything anyway. All they are doing on
raids
is annoying the casters to hell, cause they get bored with waiting, 
ignoring things like mana bars and cast times (ah well and a bit of
MAing)
*grin* :)
