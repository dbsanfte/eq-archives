Not sure on the hits on Tormax, but that's why you poke Statue of Zek.  He
gives something like 4 faction LEVELS of hit to CoV (plus) and minus to
kromzek, kromrif and tormax.

Biggest hit in Kael, except possibly AoW, but anyone who's fighting the
avatar has a very good chance of NOT killing him, and so isn't quite a good
idea for faction poking.
