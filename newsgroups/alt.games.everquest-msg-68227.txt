No offense, Sang (it's apparent that you're one of the best at the high end
power gaming type stuff), but that's why I couldn't be in an uber guild.
I've just got too much of an independant streak.  It may be that, since I'm
in the navy, I can't stand to see any of that mentality in my leisure
activity.

Of course, none of this really matters, since the very minset that makes an
uber guild unsuitable for me makes me unsuitable for an uber guild.
