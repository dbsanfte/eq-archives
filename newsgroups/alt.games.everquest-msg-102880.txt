Yes, but I'd hardly say that she's in the most stable of mindsets
right now.  The, to use a bizbee-ism, fucktards who are goading her on
are the odious assmonkeys in this.  The mom is, more than likely, just
really, really fucked up right now.  I have an aunt who very recently
lost a son (my cousin technically, but I never met the guy) and she is
NOT a well person right now.  She hasn't been able to leave the house
in about two months now.
