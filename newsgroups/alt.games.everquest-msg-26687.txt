11 Paladin in N. Ro last night at Derv 1.  The guy was so beat up he was
almost in a constant death march....

Paladinguy:  Heal me
Paladinguy:  Heal me
Paladinguy:  Heal me

Derv pops - Paladin guy attacks...long fight short, he is death marching
away about ready to die when I and my druid hunting partner (2 of us
druids!!) decide to lend a hand with the cutthroat - snare, root, do a bit
of damage.

Paladinguy deathwalks back up to the now badly hurt (but not more than half
yet!) cutthroat and reengages it as it beats on my druid partner.

Paladinguy gets the exp and of course bends down to scoop up his loot...

Paladinguy:  Heal me
Paladinguy:  Heal me
Paladinguy:  Heal me

Folks, please tell me, would we have been totally and utterly wrong just
letting him die?  In fairness to a great game and a great community, this is
the first such instance of this sort that I've had the displeasure of
witnessing in my short EQ career and am kinda puzzled as to what etiquette
demands in this case.

TIA
