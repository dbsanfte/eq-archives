   I feel your pain.  Or, to be more precise, I fear
that I may feel it soon too.  I use Cox internet
connection, which evidently is powered by Excite.
So soon I may be stuck with a crappy dial-up also.
I...I don't know if I'm strong enough to take that.
    I went to Cox's home page.  It recommends that I
download software for a free dail-up service.  Then
they thoughtfully provide a link to net zero, which
gives a full ten hours of free internet service a
month.  
    This, Cox reassures me, should be enough to tide
me over should there be a temporary interruption in
my service.
   So now I know.  Cox sure as hell doesn't know
me very well.
