    I doubt they could get caught even IF ratted out. I mean, how can VI
figure out an account was sold if things are done properly? Changed IP
address? I moved. Changed credit card? Being billed to someone else now, as
a gift. Original account information? Get that from the person who you
bought the account from.

    On my server, there's a growing number of level 58-60 characters who
have been E-Bay'ed, or traded to friends. Scarcius, Tular, Alyssandra,
Nineveh, Crowx - all have changed hands, and announced their departure in
public forums. Most of the new owners have posted as "the second", too, in
those forums. VI hasn't busted them yet, and I doubt they could gather the
*conclusive proof* that would be required to show that someone other than
the original owner of the account is now using it.
