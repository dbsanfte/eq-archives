Not at all, since I am perfectly capable of telling the
difference between a legitimate question and one that deserves
some grief.

May you someday acquire the same ability.

However, since you recently killfiled me for the sin of providing
cites that you had specifically asked me for, I will now accuse
you of being a pitiful coward for sniping at me from behind 
the safety of your killfile.

If you want nothing to do with me, keep me in your killfile
and pretend I don't exist.  If you want to continue bickering
at me, then drop the killfile and take return fire like a man.

But your repeated snipes at me after having already killfiled
me only make you look like a spiteful little sissy.

If you can't take the heat, don't keep throwing any my way.

Make up your mind -- do you want to fight, or do you want
to hide from me?  Do one or the other, Bizbee, your current
behavior is pathetic.
