	Im messing with a Level 5 necro Eurd here trying to build
faction.  Well, it seems im dubious to the Wood Elf folk...  and I am
assuming just kill orcs to build the faction so I can sell to the
vendors.  When I kill orcs, what faction message am I looking for?
In particular I am really looking to build my Dwarven faction so I can
turn in my Crushbone belts, but when running to Kaladim, the guards
are ready to attack. 
	I did an OOC to ask what to do about this faction, and got the
response Kill orcs...  but what is the faction message Im looking for.
I didnt see any particular message that says Dwarves.

Your time is appreciated.
