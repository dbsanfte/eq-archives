I currently use charm for crowd control when someone won't assist or a 
mob is unmezzable.  It sounds like that use will be gone too, which is a 
shame.

I would like to seem them add a new line of charm spells with less 
resist that make the mob unable to attack, or barely able to attack. 
That might fix the problem while not nerfing crowd control use of charm.
