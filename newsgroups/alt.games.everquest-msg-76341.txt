Work at getting your STA up to 100.  After that, most of us sub-50 go with
AC, HP, Str, .. Dex/Agi

We get crits and deadlies from thrown weapons, but their range tends to be
sorely lacking and the damage from crits/deadlies are still pretty shabby.
If you're pulling, your priority should be to do as *little* damage as
possible or, preferably, none.  Using the mob's agro to you, or a debuff,
is useful.  The advantage to this is that it makes it easier to taunt it off
of you.  A successful evade does not always guarantee, trust me.

I've never played a caster :)

On the other hand, *because* RS is rog-specific it's price hasn't really
dropped that much.  On my server, it's still pretty much the mark of twinked
up alts who can afford to pay the same old price for it.

Look for Velium Fire rings - 6 ac 65 hp.  Str is nice, but actually adds
very little to your overall damage.  HP will keep you alive should an evade
fail.

Gloves go for usually about 25k.  Haven't seen a BP sold in ages.  As I said
above, debuffing is great for easy taunt-off.  These gloves cast a Cancel
Magic which are also fantastic for clearing off a DS from a mob.  Most
Mrylo's has a long cast time, though, and our ability to re-hide while
casting was recently nerfed so that it makes Sneak Pulling more difficult.
