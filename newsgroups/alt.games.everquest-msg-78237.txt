I'll let the others tell you to forget Dex and go for AC.  To answer your 
question, some player-made jewelry you can get is:

Electrum Fire Emerald Bracelet, +5 
Silver Star Ruby Veil, +5 
Platinum Onyx Bracelet, +6 
Platinum Black Pearl Ring, +6 
Gold Star Ruby Ring, +7 
Platinum Star Ruby Veil, +9 

Price will fluxuate depending on who makes the jewelry for you.  My chanter 
can get PLat bard for 105pp in freeport.  Black pearls go for about 15-25 
on my server.  You can check the other gems at the vendors.

Go to: http://www.allakhazam.com and click on the equipment by slot link on 
the left, then narrow it down by Dex and your class.
