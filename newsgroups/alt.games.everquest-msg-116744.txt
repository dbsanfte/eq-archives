I don't see a bow either.  I've checked on IE6 under XP and Konqueror 
2.2.1 AND Netscape 4.78 under RedHat Linux and see no bow in any view.  I 
do see a belt and a leather strap across the chest that *could* be a 
quiver, but just as likely to be holding the Lodi Shell to his back.  Damn 
druids and their uber gear.
