Yeah, Fennin is funny that way. We were one of the last servers to wake 
the Sleeper, and hell, after four years, I only found out recently which 
one was our local "uberguild".

I think all those are good reasons to quit, to be honest. I don't play 
much anymore myself, but I think I'll hold on to my account for now, or 
maybe try the multiple option and play Planetside while waiting for EQII 
for a while (and by the way, how come the greedy-ass bastards won't 
include SWG in the deal?), unless some development happens that makes 
Druids more fun to play. I've tried alts, but I just don't feel like 
climbing the ladder again, and somehow /testbuff leaves you with zero 
attachment to the newly buffed character.

At the end of the day one is supposed to play EQ for enjoyment. The 
moment when an hour in EQ becomes less enjoyabe than an hour outside, 
that's the moment to quit.
