There's a raging debate at the moment on the busiest of the chat 
channels on the Combine server (erroneously misnamed Bazaar, although it 
honestly houses less commerce than practically any other channel, in 
terms of signal to noise) about where the best exp is to be had in the 
current "old world" as it stands for the post 40 crowd..

We have all the original zones, plus add ons like Paineel, Warrens, 
Stonebrunt, The Hole, and Jaggedpine.  Its original MM, CT, Splitpaw, 
Befallen, but new lavastorm (with most of the nameds removed 
apparantly), new Nektulos, and new freeport (ick ick ick.. .but I just 
heard a rumor about the sewers)oh and NRo/SRo/somebody stole Oasis.

In particular, half the people are claiming JP is the fastest exp you 
can get while others are claiming its the slowest.  I can't find a ZEM 
chart recent enough to include it at all, so that isn't helping.  I do 
notice that I can easily solo the basilisks and the anchorite gnolls, 
which I can get single and without adds even if I don't bother snaring; 
this means that the exp might not be fantastic but its very low effort.

Kunark is going to open in just a few days, rendering the question 
somewhat moot, but I wondered what people thought here; where's the best 
place to get 42-50 on Combine: first, soloing (and we're talking SK tank 
solo, not fear kiting) and second, in a decent group (again, no tricks 
like an all pet group or some kite arrangement, just good solid 
tank/healer/DPS and perhaps CC)

I doubt I can pull it off, with the deadline looming and plenty of RL 
work to be done, but it would be nice to hit 50 before the doors come 
off this thing on Friday.

Berg, 42 SK, Combine
