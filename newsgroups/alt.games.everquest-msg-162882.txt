Stupid question in response: is the armor from your native town? Is the
combining kit given by that same town? If you are fighting in Qeynos hills,
you must be a half elf or human druid, probably devoted to Karanas, and born
in Surefall Glade, and the kit must come from SFG. Recipes must match kit.
