You've forgotten in your list the need for Atropine in case of a Sarin
attacks. Actually, I'd tell you to inject it now provalactivly but
knowing you'd probably do it to your children as well I better refrain
from sarcasm.

BTW it is really tough for someone to spread biologics effectively and
even harder (due to the huge quantities needed) to use a nerve agent
to wipe out a signifigant part of the population. If there where
readily available viruii/bacteria that were capable of being globally
released/spread and live without being in a host body for long periods
of time we would have all been dead many eons ago.

Still there is a need to examine a possible bio-attack...just no
reason to be paranoid. If it does happen the most likely thing would
be for more suicider attackers to infect themselves with a highly
contagious virus and go into a dense population to try to spread it.
Still it would take some major bio-engineering to pull off something
that isn't a readily available virus. 

I'm much more worried about somebody ramming a boat or a truck filled
with explosives into a bridge or a building than being nerved gassed.
