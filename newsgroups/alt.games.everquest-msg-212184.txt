*gnashes her teeth*

I really really wish they wouldn't keep cutting science from school
curricula.  

There is *every* reason for it to happen, as it is *not*
counterproductive. Any behavior in social creatures that forms lasting
bonds that keeps folks working together is productive.  There is no reason
for it to be "selected against" in the gene pool.  Might as well call any
friendship counterproductive because people aren't having babies out of
it.  

And as for whether a behavior is "selfish" or not, what the feck does that
have to do with anything?  People are selfish all the time in sexual
relationships.  Dear gosh, I want to mate with the man that I love, not
the man who will guarantee my children the best genetic mix...burn that
woman, she's not mating for the good of society!   In fact, if my husband
doesn't allow me to mate with some better stud and then raise those
children as his own, well then he's just a selfish bastard.  Cuz we all
only mate for the good of the species....riiiiight?
