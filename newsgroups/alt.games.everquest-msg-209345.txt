Can suggestions be kept relevant?

This Chr is 22, not in 50's, not in 40's, not in 30's.
What/which damage shield(s)?

So much of the suggestions made are useless because they don't help the
person at their level, which is what they need to know.

My 2c.
http://www.dotnetdiva.com is a good place for bard information.

You didn't say what race of bard, though, if you have POk, it doesn't
matter.


CB was good to 20, especially in throne room.
I then shifted to High Hold Keep for Goblin/Lookout Rooms group, then
onto Warrior/Raider Rooms groups (mid 30's).

Basically, when group is attacking, you play melee and resist songs. It
is best if you develop your own understanding and try the various songs
out. You will need different songs at different times depending on the
mobs and the abilities of the other people in your group. 

During downtime, you will almost always find 20-Cassindras universally
wanted, although I gave preference to 6-Hymm of Restoration if clerics
were tardy or oom and new mobs were expected.

Play the songs, see what they do and develop your own understanding.
