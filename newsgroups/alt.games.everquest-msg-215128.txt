Well, I guess my easy romp is over! The last few days, I have been
working on my new Iksar Beastlord. I have been doing all of the newbie
quests and am down to the last item, the tunic. The creatures I have to
kill are Froglok Tuk Warriors. Green to Light blue so far. The trouble
is that they are interspersed within red, red creatures.... Many of
them!

I have been killed twice today even though I tried to pull the Warriors
away from the others. Twice new ones popped right on top of me. I
quickly pulled up the map, marked the spot, saved the map then died. I
zoned back into Swamp of No Hope, pulled up the map, no notation! Well,
I sort of know where I was, so summon little scaly and head off. Jumped
again. There was nothing I could see, so I must assume another creature
popped on top of or just behind me. Lucky me, both pops were red. Did
the map thing again, but again it didn't show when I zoned back in. I
should really learn the loc system, but while I know how it works, can't
get my mind around it. Not a good thing to admit for a computer
programer, but there it is!! What it all boils down to is I have lost 2
corpses. A passing shaman said I should ask a Necromancer to help. Swamp
of No Hope, both Cabilis's, Field Of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen contained
only one player, me. I sent a tell to the shaman, and he said to buy a
chipped bone rod to find my corpses. Spent an hour searching Cabilis
merchants and no joy.

Does anyone know where I could find one in Cabilis or anywhere else my
characters below can travel to? I'm on Drinal server.

Mark
