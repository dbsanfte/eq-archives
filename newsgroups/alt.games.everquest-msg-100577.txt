Your a real sucker then . The rental market atm is brutally soft, high
supply coupled with low demand have seen a decrease in rental costs not an
increase. The cost of electrical power in california has gone up
substantially largely due to an incompetent populace electing the same type
of leaders.

The cost of ever increasing computing power is also still on a sharp
decline. I.e. new equipment brought on line is cheaper then old equipment
already in place.

I beleive they are raising the price just because they feel like doing so.
Since I am a free market type of guy I dont see a problem with them trying
to rake in the cash while they are still pretending to be a monopoly. I also
do not believe though that subscriptions are on the rise. If I use first
person perspective I would guess that they have lost 33% of their people not
gained more like they seem to be trying to indicate.
