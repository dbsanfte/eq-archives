While I may be perverted, after hearing the opening theme to Cleopatra:
2525, and the ensuing inexplicable urge to shove pointy metal things into my
eardrums, I swiftly turned to a different channel to watch badly scrambled
porn.

Never watched "Space:1999", never heard of "Voyage to the Bottom of the
Sea", and all I know about "Battlestar Galactica" is that a friend of mine
likes it, and Cylon leaders look flagrantly homosexual.
