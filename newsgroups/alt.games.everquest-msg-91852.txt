Ah - you have decided to switch to referee mode to try to draw some air of
authority since the Cheif Justice ploy didn't work eh? Try pseudo scientific
next and, when all else fails just go back to the tried and trusted
psychological terminolgy like everyone else.

Still doesn't change the fact that you and the rest of the self appointed
"regulars" have absolutely no authority whatsoever and are nothing more than
a bunch of inbred mutts pissing on fire hydrants in an attempt to mark their
"precious territory".

I find this amusing in a rather sad sort of way. As Bizbee very insightfully
pointed out I have little or no intellectual ability so and even the
smallest things amuse me. What can I say, there are worse ways to spend my
time, like looking for thrills trading toilet habits with Biz....
