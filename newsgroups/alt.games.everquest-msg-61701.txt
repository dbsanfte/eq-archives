Also, in Win98 and ME, look for the [386Enh] section, and add the following
line:
ConservativeSwapFileUsage=1

This tells the system not to use the swap file until RAM starts to fill up.

Another setting that I find to be helpful, also in the [386Enh] section, is:
MinPagingFileSize=16384

This tells the system to set the MINIMUM swap file size to 16M.  This
prevents Windows from thrashing around trying to reoptimize swap file usage
when it's smaller than that, which it usually is for me.

You gotta reboot for these to take effect.
