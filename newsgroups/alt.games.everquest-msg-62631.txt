Just a post to let you know what I have done and what results I am getting.

1. Upgraded my 700mhz athalon to 512 meg
2. Installed Geforce 3 vid card.
3. Upgraded DirectX to version 8.1
4. Did a fairly detailed check to make sure I have new drivers and no
duplicate drivers...

so...

Wednesday night, log into test and see video anomalies.  For example, in
Steamfont, the geysers mist have black rectangles around them.  Someone else
logged into test and Steamfont saw the same thing.  I assume this is a
common, known bug and that Verant is working on it.

Lets hear what your results are.

Spread across the bottom of the case, like some sort of green and gold
square pool of dried vomit, is what I can only assume is the motherboard.  ~
