Here's how I deal with assholes. 

/ignore asshole

Works like a charm. Once a month, I clean out the ignore list.
 
I don't duel. If they insist, I sicc Jakugg on 'em. And I'll heal
Jakugg. Also, if one person challenges you to a duel, nobody else can
until you zone. So I never /decline. I just don't accept either.

Like you, I don't mind helping if I have the mana to spare or am not
doing anything. But I deeply resent folks that expect me to be their
personal band aid, or XP restorer. {You're a loon if you think I'm
travelling six zones porterless just to rez some level 23 who doesn't
want to walk 3 zones. Gratis. Nor am I fond of anyone who dumps a body
next to me and says "Rez plz", or the seventh time the level 6 demands
"Heal plz"}

grumpy dwarven cleric of 49 psalms who still never uses /role or /anon.
