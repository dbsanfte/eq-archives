The following is pure spec, but fairly GOOD spec, from what i have
been able to figure out  :)

Not a monk, exactly.  BUT, the much discussed beastlord, is a half
shammie half monk character.  I have no idea how this will pan

silk is Val Shir wearable, but not my Wus armor.

Take it with a grain of salt baby!
