Reducing duration has it's own impact on things. When I'm in a raid force of
25 or so, I don't really care to stop every 20-30 minutes to rebuff everyone
on what's probably already a long raid.

That said, I agree with most of your post, and, to toss in my pet peave,
it's having a 32 cleric where I feel like if I don't have KEI (which I
generally won't go out of my way for), I have slightly less than half the
chance of finding a group. The funny thing is, my cleric (granted, she's
reasonably well twinked, but not hugely so) can generally keep up with most
battle healing for a single group. Give me any clarity to speak of at all
(heck, even breeze) and I'm usually going to be just fine - mana
conservation is a wonderful thing.

Why is it that I need a lvl 60 buff for folks to consider my lvl 32 toon
worthwhile?
