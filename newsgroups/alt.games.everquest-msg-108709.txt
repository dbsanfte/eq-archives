A lot of times it's dependent on resist rates and such, for things such as
the Tro Jeg in Scarlet, kiting is the way to go, since they have an annoying
habit of breaking root a lot (it's either them or the Sun Revenants, the
stuff on the plateau) making root/dot a royal PITA, whereas for stuff like
Shissar in the Grey, they just have too many hp and you're better off
root/dotting.

That said, I'm gonna scream if one more assling pops up and gyps me on VSR.
