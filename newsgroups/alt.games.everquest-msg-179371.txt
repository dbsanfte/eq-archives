New zones, new spells, new race. Nope, nothing new, just changing
existing content. Duh...

Can't say either way until Sony says something, which they haven't.
Until they do, take any rumors of price increases with an entire

Profits? Not really. The increased running costs was such that the fee
increase brought them back on par with where they were before....
