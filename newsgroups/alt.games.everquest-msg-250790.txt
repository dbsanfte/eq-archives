From the FAQ on the hopefully-soon-to-be-released-last-date-I-heard-was-June
Feature update:

A source close to the Freedom Corps mentioned something about a new Tailor
program is in the works?

The Freedom Corps will soon sponsor a tailor to create, mend and alter
heroes' costumes. Their methods range from old-fashioned sewing to genetic
alteration. The Freedom Corps believes that it serves the hero community -
and thus helps Paragon City to create a brand new generation of heroes.

The Freedom Corps does not charge any money for its services. In order to
access the tailor, heroes need to accomplish a few good deeds in the name of
the Freedom Corps. But any costume change inevitably costs the player
Influence; a change in appearance means that a hero isn't quite the
recognizable figure that he was before!
