Not sure of the answer for this one to be honest.  Personally I always carry
a stack of pdots on my ranger for exactly this purpose. I am constantly
amazed at the number of clerics who thank me profusely and then tell me that
I am the only one that did that in my group.  To have the benefits of a
symbol especially virtue or aego is well worth covering the cost of the
pdot.
