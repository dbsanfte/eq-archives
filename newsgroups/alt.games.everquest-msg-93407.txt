LoL...trust me, nothing irritates me more than words like ne1 and sentences
like oic.  And not to beat a dead horse, so if I drew a picture of mickey
mouse, just one picture, he wouldn't be a cartoon character?  And I, too,
know and work with many prepubescent 40 year olds.  In fact, one of my work
responsibilities is to teach them life skills and coping skills.  However, I
do take issue with the fact that if I use the word "toon" to
decscribe...well...a cartoonish on-screen likeness, that implies, without
any other knowledge of me, that I am prepubescent.  But I have learned that
in the EQ world, people are quick to jump to judgment of others and have
grown quite accustomed to it (which probably isn't good either).  Anyway,
just thought I would attempt to explain the reference.  If you don't like
it, that is your choice.  Just as it is my choice to use it.  Bah...I've
wasted too much of everyone's time on such a silly thing...
