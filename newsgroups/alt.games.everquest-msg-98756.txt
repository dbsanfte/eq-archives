Hang on. You're saying that the /chat channels are *global*? (i.e. you
can hear them from any zone, like guild chat works?)  That's freaking
AMAZING!

If this is true, that's a big improvement to the game, and will make
auctioning easy for everyone. Just get near a Luclin portal spire and
start auctioning while you fight. If a deal is struck, it's a small
matter to meet at the nexus, or the bazaar if banking is required for
the transaction.

I like this. :-)
