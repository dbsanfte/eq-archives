Umm, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't "/auction" be the logical thing 
to add? If I'm not mistaken (and I'm fairly certain I'm not), each line in 
a macro can be up to 59 characters in length. This is based off the layout 
of the character .opt file and as far as I'm aware there is currently no 
way around this.
