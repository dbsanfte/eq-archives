    Well, take this to the next level. This scammer, according to the Yantis
link, sells all posessions on the account, then sells the account and the
plat. He also uses the Paypal account to continue to buy and sell plat. If
Yantis is the one that bought the account, and the original owner comes
looking for it, Yantis will lose the account without recompensation or will
have the Paypal charge reversed by whoever bought it from him. If the
original owner complains about being stripped, Yantis will lose whatever
mule received the plat. That mule could have a ton of stuff on it. If the
Paypal account owner gets his Paypal account back, he could reverse all
fraudulent charges on it - including purchases of plat from Yantis.

    This is all ignoring the hit to reputation Yantis is suffering right
now. Would you buy anything that could either be stripped from your account,
or cause your account to be banned?

    I tailor for my guild. One pair of elemental silk pants, sold and then
the resulting plat sold, would pay someone's rent for a month. People in
guild didn't understand why I was so paranoid about tradeskill item security
until I pointed that out.

    One reseller won their case IIRC. I doubt Sony wants to go through the
hassle, only to lose and have the floodgates open wide. And that's the real
risk, that if they lose the whole reselling market will explode and people
will try and stream out of the game the moment prices on EQ items dip.
