Actually Dark Tyger, I did not start it. My first post on this tangent was on
the basis that the definition of "low-levels" being definded as level 6 players
is a dumb one to make because what drops in an area that level 6 players would
go for that a level 50 player would also go for? What can a level 6 player get
from a mob that is not cloth armor or rusty weapon? That was the original
agrument.

And I was called a  "Strawman" for point out this. I was told that things other
then rusty weapons dropped in Stoneburnt. I was told to "from me to you - go
fuck yourself" by Drake. That was an attack against me. And it was an attack
against a legitimate argument. What will drop on a mob that a level 6 player
can kill with a group that a level 50 player would want to farm? What would a
level 50 player be denigning a group of level 6 players from obtaining because
they are actively camping an item?

I can think of absolutely nothing. In fact, the lowest item I can think that is
over any value to a high level player is the stone from the named mob in Qeynos
Hills. I believe that mob is a level 16 NPC. Which means that the group would
generally have to be level 13+ to reasonably take it down. How can the TCC help
low-levels when low-levels is defined as level 6 or lower? In fact, what do
low-levels that are level 6 and lower needing to be protected from that the TCC
protects them from? The "theift" of rusty weapons?
