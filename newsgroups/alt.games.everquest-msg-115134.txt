Most likely a game glitch (in Blackburrow at least). Usually when
there is a difference in the Z-Axis (elevation) between you and
another PC or mob strange things can happen. You might see them
running into a wall for a couple of seconds and then disappear. This
happens all the time in Blackburrow if you are standing on the ramp
and another player passed through ahead of you. Basically your PC is
drawing them where it "thinks" they currently are, and what you see is
lagging behind where they actually are.
