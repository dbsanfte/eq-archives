Ok how about increasing a few epic quest items i mean i have a lvl 55 mage who
camped in for a mage epic item for 4 months 11 hrs a day straight before one
dropped-what about other classes that rare drops take forever to drop or what
about fact mage epic is useless after lvl 60

Or how about Necromancer epic Needing Eye of innoruk which u can only get from
plane of hate what about other places inny spawns?

And wht about CR GYs they decided against it now or what- i think the idea of
death and losing all your gear including your stat penalty is extremely
harsh....
