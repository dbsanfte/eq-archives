Heh. I've given up on getting upset about that shit. An hour to buff?
YOU UBER BASTARDS!  If I <schedule> a raid for 1 p.m. on a Sunday, it's
a fucking miracle if I have enough people there by 2 p.m. to fill the
groups and *start* buffing. Sure, once that's done we can move through
some things fast, but I've come to realize, slowly but surely, that as
long as I stay with my guild (which I very much like, and have no
intention of leaving at present) we're never even going to be in ToV,
say nothing of Sleepers and the like.  They're just way too laid back
and not mentally raid oriented. Raids happen, but it's hit or miss. I
would say the *majority* of them are more of a mindset that "raids are
fun enough, I guess. If I'm on then and I'm not busy I'll stop by and
help."

This is not the raid force that winds up waking the sleeper, trust me.
