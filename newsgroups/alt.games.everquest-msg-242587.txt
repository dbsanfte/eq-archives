Shouldn't it be Kedge.. its one of the Elder Races.

I thought Luggald was the playable-Froglock.. till I return recently.

Man, Playing Froglock in 3rd person has made me dizzy, how does it
feels playing Ogre in 3rd person? (I am one of those that will get head
spinning if playing in 1st person.. oooh Aliens vs Predator.. oooh Tomb
Raider.. sigh, imagine THAT! =)
