Heh -- the game designers already thought of that one.

After Runnyeye was revamped, a lot of the new mobs got
both attack and death messages.  This one had me rolling
on the floor:

[When it aggroes and attacks:]
     a Pickclaw Destroyer says 'You are ugly, there is no
            doubt. I think I will poke your eyeballs out!'

[When you kill it:]
     a Pickclaw Destroyer's corpse says 'Was it because 
            I called you ugly?'


Another funny one:

[Aggro message:]
      Lord Pickclaw says 'You invade my realm, and you kill
           my vassals!  For that I shall strip your flesh, and 
           wear it as tassels.'

[Death message:]
      Lord Pickclaw's corpse shouts 'I am dead, this is
           true.  But at least my stupid rhymes are through!'
