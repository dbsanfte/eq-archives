Well, maybe not much in melee. But as a druid, going LD while root/dotting
is almost always better than going LD while kiting - especially quadding.
I've gone LD while while root dotting and came back to find the snare dumb
MOB still standing there. I've also gone LD while quadding, and well,
finding my corpse was a pain :).

And even in melee - while porcupining. My DS does about 4 times the damage I
can do with my Dark Ember (maxed 1hb and Offense as well). I just wish I
could med while being beat on to get defense skill up - 196 now :). Anyway,
with a DoT on it, and DS/regen on me, a single MOB has a good chance of
being snare dumb before killing me no matter if I swing or not. So going LD
here is not always fatal. Going LD with a quad is.

Another point I forgot to mention for the original post. Level 35 is Sooooo
much easier because you can see while medding (just sit down). You may want
to wait till then to start quadding. At 35, I was getting 1 1/2 to 2 blues
for each quad. Takes 15 -20 min med/buff time in between though, still
possible to get more than a yellow every hour. Iceclad is a LONELY place. If
that's your thing then great, but don't get too hooked on fast exp, you may
have more fun PLAYING your character with other folks rather than grinding
through levels as fast as you can.
