I'm thankful I read this tonight.  I just started EQ in Nov, and messed up on a
halfing druid, putting some points into con instead of wis.  Now I'm lvl 29,
and was so happy to get GG spells and such. I've scraped up enough pp to buy
some wis items but,  my guild advised me I should delete and start over, since
my base wisdom is pretty low.

I'm dreading the thought.  They said I'll have a horrible time when I get to
45+, even with wis items.  This true?
