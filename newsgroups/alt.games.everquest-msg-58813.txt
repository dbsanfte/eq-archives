      Also, paladins and SKs generally use a shield; warriors
generally don't.  Were you comparing the AC number, or the AC of
breastplates, leggings, belt, etc.?  The warrior with the FBSS has
zero armor there, but the mob will go down much faster while he wears
it than wearing an AC 20 belt and no haste gear.  Ther paladin may
have more AC while the warrior has haste.
