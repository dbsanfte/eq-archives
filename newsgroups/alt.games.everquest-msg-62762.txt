I've never screamed about it.  I don't have windows keys in my keyboard, I
took them out a long time ago, Ctrl-Esc is simple enough for me to use
instead.  I might add that I did not reformat in an attempt to take care of
this problem, I had issues with some software installed by someone else on
my system.  I just know that the problem was not taken care of by the
reformatting.  I rarely reboot my system, as with Win2k, unlike 9x, I find
that I don't have to shut it down regularly to give a reasonable chance of
reliable operation.
