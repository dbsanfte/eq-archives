Two things there
First, Can rangers fear giants?
Second, what you have described sounds like a pathing exsploit and I suggest
you avoid using it or face the wrath of a GM.

To the OP, the Tribals in DSP are rare, it is nearly always hoppers in the
those caves (these can be fear kited) I'd keep trying DSP when you can, only
reason for the Sambata to be in house is for Twilight armour quests and
there are few that do those, It's also much tougher to kill Age Old
Rockhopper than it is the Tribal Chief (each of these will swap the spawns)
