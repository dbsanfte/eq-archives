I used to do this with my Paladin, but it seems like all stuns break mez
now (it's been quite a while since I've stunned a mezzed mob and not had
mez break), so I either Root or /gsay the enchanter to hold off on mez
and use a long duration stun (Holy Might, 6 seconds or so) which gives
the enchanter time to mez after my stun hits.  Also, when I Stun a
mezzed mob, not only does the my Stun break mez, but the mob is not
stunned by it.  Since my stun seems to garner agro as usual I have taken
to using Cease (15mana 1sec duration) to break mez cheaply with the mob
almost never going after the enchanter (unless he's one of those genius
enchanters who _always_ sits down when he's not actually casting, heh).

I've seen situations where the MA and the MT were not the same person.
The MA would pick the target and stay on it until it was dead, while
the MT would work on holding agro from multiple targets.  Doubt this
works very well in the high-end game tho.

I've seen that as EA (Emergency Assist) tho PA (Panic Assist) might be
a more accurate description.  :)
