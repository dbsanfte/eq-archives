For your edification, from the post of John Smedley's comments regarding
beta testers:

"I also want to announce that many of our Legendary Subscribers will be
the first to experience EverQuest II in its Beta sometime next year. We
will be giving preference to longtime Legends Subscribers, so my
suggestion is that if you're
interested in EverQuest Legends, sign up now. After Legends players,
longtime EQ subscribers will be eligible for a phase of the Beta as
well. I realize this information is somewhat vague, and the onlyreason
for that is we don't have an exact date just yet, but we should sometime
later this year."

The question would remain as to what qualifies as longtime EQ subscribers.
