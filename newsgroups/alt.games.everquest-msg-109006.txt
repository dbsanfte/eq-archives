<snip childish rant>

Actually the level 3 was probably a newbie who didn't know any better.  I
didn't know at first there was a limit on who I could group with.  Give
anybody under 15 or so a little leeway.  They may be new and just don't
understand the mechanics of the game.  I say 15 because it is way too easy
to get above 10 nowadays.

A better way to handle the invite might have been patiently explaining the
system to figure who you can and cannot group with, then asking him if he
has any questions about playing.  I had a very good experience when I first
started playing with a high level who explained a few things like setting up
hotkeys and where to find maps on the net ( I was so totally lost in Gfay
till I got the map).  Giving a newbie a hard time just makes them not like
other players.  They won't be a productive member of any group if they don't
understand the dynamics of the game.
