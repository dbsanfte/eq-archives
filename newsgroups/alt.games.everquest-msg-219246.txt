So I was a little facetious. Nobody has said they enjoyed sitting on 
their ass mindlessly doing combines for hours on end either.

Because that's as good as it gets. Nobody is going to conduct a formal 
poll. The best we'll see is a some stupid web poll, which are invariably 
horridly biased.

Its not my fault some twit wanted you to back up some informal 
observation with a reference. Clearly the fact that I have better things 
to do then run formal polls, complete with methodolgies, risk analysis, 
and confidence intervals doesn't mean that my observations are without 
merit.

Which is why I am playing a fantasy role playing game... not sitting in 
the sewing room hunched over a Singer.

Tradeskill systems in video games do not have to revolve around sitting 
on your ass. For example skill ups could be quested... "Perform this 
[task] for me, and I'll teach you a new trick..."  Pretty much anything 
beats the CTS clickfest of tediously manufacturing useless unsaleable 
junk hoping for a skill up, regardless of how realistic it is.

Good games tend to abstract the mindless tedium and minutia out of the 
game, not make excuses to put it into them.
