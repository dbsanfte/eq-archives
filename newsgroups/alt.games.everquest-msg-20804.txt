My rogue now 31 and yesterday when I arrive Freeport from FV, a lvl 10
ranger wielding a much better piecing (Harpoon of the depth) than mine
(bloodstain fang). I remember I am using Giant snake fang at lvl 10. I did
get some real good stuff from high lvl rogue when I doing my redemption
quest and asking for their help, but I never try to buy those expensive gear
from other player. This is a RPG and a rogue is money lover, instead of
wasting those money to get 'better eqpt", I rather save the copper for
future use.

At this stage, keep going and you should be able to get more cash when you
reach higher lvl. I gain most of my cash in LOIO and FM, suggest you try
there (esp. the drops from giant can easy sell for 10 - 50 PP).
