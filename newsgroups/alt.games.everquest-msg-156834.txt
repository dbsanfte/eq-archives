Ok, since the patch, I'm having a problem staying connected for more than a
minute at a time, before getting kicked to desktop. The screen also flashes
about every five seconds. I updated my Video card driver, but it didn't do
anything. Any other suggestions, or perhaps this is something I should just
wait for Verant to fix?
