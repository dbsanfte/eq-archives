Did the tank Taunt till the mez broke or did he taunt the hit it.
there if the tank sat the taunt, taunt, taunt ant taunt 9the Taunt
itself can break the mez then the tank has a lot of hate built up as i
saw here allso if you were sitting to close the mob see ya as a easy
target.

     this is JUST ideas allso if the tank is a WAR have him allso try
disarm as well as Taunt as the disarm works a very good taunt in its
own right
