It's a steel hilted flint dagger, and yes, the damage and delay suck. That said, with
his dex as high as it is, he normally procs 3 times or more in an average fight and is
seldom resisted, so he considers it well worth it, especially with a faster, higher
damage weapon in the other hand. Quad procs are not terribly uncommon for him and 2400+
damage in a round is nothing to complain about. /grin
