I'm guessing prices here - YMMV:

Gatorscale arms/legs (~600pp each?), whitescale tunic (2-300pp),
shardtooth's flayed skin tunic (4-500pp), drake hide stuff, bear/wolf
stuff from the Millers (few pp) - leather look

Runed Circlet (400pp), gem inlaid gauntlets (200pp), some cultural
armours (mucho pp) - chain look

Gloves of the gatecaller (free, but nodrop so you need Erudin mage
faction, and non-mages need to get hold of a couple of level 1 summoned
items from someone, also bear in mind they're made of lead or uranium or
something) - black
