CH can be the most mana-efficient heal you have.  When casting on your
tanks, I started casting at 2 bubbles of health.  You will develop a "feel"
for it as time goes on and will learn to adjust your cast times.  One
suggestion for you... During downtime someday soon med up to full and then
chain-cast CH so you know how many CH's you have in your "tank".  Nothing
makes a cleric feel like poop than casting a CH and getting that
"Insufficient mana to cast this spell" dreck as your tank dies.

If you haven't already, keep a spell slot dedicated to Divine Aura.  Divine
Barrier gives the same effect for double the cast time, and when the baddies
target YOU for CHing the tank, a well-timed DA can save your hide, allowing
you to save your party's hide.
