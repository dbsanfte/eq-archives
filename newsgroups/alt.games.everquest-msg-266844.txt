Congratulations.

You've discovered "Capitalism".

The profits from a successful venture are reinvested in a new
ventures, in order to make MORE profits. 

Failure to do this in a competitive market results in no profits, loss
of jobs, and the ultimate end of the original venture. If you don't
the MMORPG market is competitive, well, I'm glad you can get internet
on your planet.

EQ1 is aging. Sony has a choice - either continue to support it alone
while slowly bleeding customers to newer games, or to keep it alive as
a cash generating engine and funnel the funds into a game which could
compete in the modern marketplace. EITHER WAY, EQ1 would eventually
end - but one way, Sony continues to make money. The other way, they
don't.

Hmm. Make money or not make money? Hmm, hmm, hmm. This is a stickler
of a conundrum!

I'm gonna go with "make money". YMMV.

And if you think capitalism is teh suxxorz, well, have fun with all
those great MMORPGs coming out of North Korea, Cuba, and...uhm...is
there anyone else left? (Don't say China, they're running dogs now,
too.)
