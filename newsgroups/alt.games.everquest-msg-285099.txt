Have the shaman drink a DS potion, have the mage cast DS on him, and 
then the shaman tanks, not doing any actual damage, while the mage does 
whatever he can to do at least one point of damage per mob.  Thats all 
it takes, one point of damage, since the  DS damage doesn't count for 
anything.  Meanwhile, with his regen and Stoicism, the shaman should be 
a much better damage sponge than your mage.

Of course, the beauty of having the mage be the sponge is that you'll be 
getting his defensive skill up, so you should do that till it caps, its 
less effective but more beneficial.
