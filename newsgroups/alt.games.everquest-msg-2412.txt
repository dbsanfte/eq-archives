Verant has not issued any of the actual formulas because they do not want EQ to
be a game about math. Yeah, it is frustrating at times but I generally agree
with that position.

As you get higher, you will start to notice different /con messages within the
same color. At 16th level, I am seeing two different blues ('kind of dangerous'
and 'risky') and two different greens ('might win, but it is not certain' and
'safe opponent'). I still get experience with the 'might win' greens, but not
from the 'safe opponent' greens, and a mob that is 'kind of dangerous' seems to
give more experience than the same type which is merely 'risky'.

I recall a webpage that had those messages and relative level... anyone?
