*snicker*. Actually he's got a sixtyfive shammy and a warlord, so 
probably not.

But back to the question at hand, while I wouldn't use the term "PL" to 
describe the environment, I do agree that the game has changed such that 
even the most clueless, friendless solo new player can now get past 
level ten in a couple hours. It's just nowhere near as hard as it used 
to be. That, combined with (as you noted) the huge variety of zones do 
blow through the low levels in has left a lot of them pretty damned empty.
