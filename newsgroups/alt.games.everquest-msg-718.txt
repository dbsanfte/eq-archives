I'm adding support for more of the critical-hit-style attacks to my log
parser.  These are the hits where you get a message like:

Soandso Scores a critical hit!(57)
You hit a_mob_00 for 57 points of damage.
 
The only ones I know of are Critical Hits, Crippling Blows, and the rogue
Deadly Strikes.

Are there any others?  Don't monks get some attacks like this too?

If so, could you either email me or follow up with an example from a log.

Thanks!
Joe D
