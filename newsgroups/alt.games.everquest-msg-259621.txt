This is a typically -bad- test.

Its like selecting a condo to live in based on how long it takes you to 
drive (on average, at different times of the day) to a -random- point in 
the city. Concluding much of anything from that test is ridiculous. The 
condo only has (limited!) control over the congestion in its own parking 
lot, and the test clearly might be dominated by other factors.

Comparing isps (nevermind dsl to cable) on a randomly selected internet 
host is meaningless. For all you know ISP A actually hosts google and 
you're 4 hops away on the same ISP... vs 15 hops through an intermediate 
badly congested router that is scheduled for upgrades, for ISP B... or 
vice versa.

The only time ping tests to a host would be relevant is if the basis of 
your isp selection is if its ping statistics -to that host- are a 
deciding factor. (ie you only want to play eq, and you are selecting 
your ISP beased on its 'closeness' to the EQ server you play on.)

I think the bottom line is that their isn't anything definitive that can 
be said.

Some cable ISPs -do- overload their networks, and some don't. Or in some 
cases there is regional overloading; presumably (hopefully) pending 
upgrades... so it depends where you are and who you are with, and their 
internal policies on what is acceptable overloading, and how 
aggressively they are upgrading infrastructure to prevent it. In Canada 
at least most cable providers are ahead of the curve expanding capacity 
in advance of demand, while other ISPs in other countries may be running 
behind the curve, playing catch up with demand for capacity.

This isn't unique to cable though. A DSL ISP can overload just as 
easily. Sure the last leg of wire is dedicated to you... but those wires 
just feed into concentrators where you are sharing the wire with all 
your neighbours. 

You may have heard them say they need to allocate ports, or heard them 
talking about deploying a 'stinger'; this is the sort of device they are 
talking about: 

http://www.lucent.com/livelink/09009403800579be_Brochure_datasheet.pdf

In simplest terms its conceptually not much different from a typical 
home Linksys router. (minus the NAT 'firewall') With x number of adsl 
ports coming in from you and your neigbours, and an uplink connector 
going out to the ISP.

I don't think there is any clearer evidence one can have that your DSL 
bandwidth is ultimately shared with your neighbours. They stick one of 
these boxes in a neighbourhood and connect everyone to it. When they run 
out of ports they add another box. The boxes themselves can uplink with 
as little as a single T1 line. (a piddly 1.5mbps... on a 72 port stinger 
that means if -everyone- tried to max it at the same time there is only 
capacity for 20kbps per port. You do the math...

Sure they -could- put in an OC3 uplink... or even 2... but theres a cost 
associated with that. And ultimately just like cable, the degree of 
congestion on DSL is primarily a matter of policy (ie how much 
congestion they will tolerate before upgrading infrastructure) and not 
significantly a matter of technology.

You have a dedicated connection from your house to the box. That is the 
extent of your dedicated connection.
