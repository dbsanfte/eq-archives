Oh, and one more thing -- the Aegis of Life turn-in
requires a *very* high faction standing.  Don't be surprised
if Camlend tells you to get lost even after a lot of
faction work.  At the time I did it, you needed a very
high "Warmly" rating.  Now that they've added the "Allied"
faction category, that might be what's required.  So be
sure to do the quest conversation with him to test
whether he likes you enough before you do the turn-in.

Note:  The fastest way to raise faction standing with him
by far, is to get a friend to start a newbie warrior in
Qeynos, buff him up and give him a Fine Steel weapon or
something, and have him kill the fish in the pool under
the UFO.  Warning:  Killing the fish gives a HUGE negative
faction hit with Qeynos (and the Priests Of Life), so
do *not* participate in the fish-killing yourself, nor
buff/heal your friend while he's aggroed by the fish.
This is why you need to use a "throw-away newbie" for
the killings.  Once he kills the fish, you loot the
fish parts from the corpse (they drop about 40% of the
time), and hand them to the guard who's swimming at the
end of the pool.  This will give you VERY LARGE faction
increases.  Ten or so fish part turn-ins should give you
good enough faction standing to do the Aegis of Life.
