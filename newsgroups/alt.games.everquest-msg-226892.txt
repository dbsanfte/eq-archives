Oh sure, thats cool, but I wasn't saying that.  Not that this proves I'm 
not a moron, but I only said that warriors were better tanks for raid 
targets, not that they were indespensible.

I also don't think that any degree of superiority in a raid makes up for 
  substantial inferiority in an exp situation.  Raids don't get you exp, 
and if you dont' get exp you eventually rot and die.

Whats not to see?  Cleric rez is superior to paladin rez.  You can't 
argue that by claiming its smoke.  Its more exp back, and less time 
wasted.  Paladin rez is a backup position, if the cleric dies, paladin 
rez him and he can rez everyone else.  Or its a substitute; if you don't 
have a cleric, a paladin can fill the role.  Its not anyone's first choice.

I agree that its not a bad secondary choice, that the difference 
betweeen one and the other aren't large enough to worry over...I fully 
support the idea that a paladin rez (particularly once you've reached 
90%) is a very nice thing the class brings to the table... but I draw 
the line at trying to say they are actually the same thing.

Yet if you do the math, shaman slow is 20% worse than enchanter slow. 
If you have both in group, and a mob that really requires slowing, then 
you don't have the chanter do the job.  Big waste of resources.

If you don't have a shaman available, enchanter slows make a fine 
substitute.  If the shaman is having some troubles slowing, the 
enchanter slow makes a fine backup.

The situation is indeed quite analogous to the paladin vs cleric rez 
situation... only its even less ludicrous than differentiating between 
the two rez levels, since although the paladin rez is 60% worse than the 
cleric rez, the exp loss after even paladin rez is easy to shrug off. 
20% more damage per second from some mobs, though, can be the difference 
between something you can keep up heals on and something you can't.
