Isn't Iron Crown the one with the different table for each weapon and about 90%
of all combat hits result in referencing one or another criticals table for more
specific results?  Arms law, claw law, spell law...  I didn't mean to imply that
it was particulary good, only that it was trying to model at least some of the
more complicated factors involved in really hitting people with various sorts of
weapons.  Heck, I said GURPS didn't I?  I could have mentioned Aftermath, too,
which approached armor on a matierials science basis...  For that matter, I
think there are some optional systems in one or another official version of AD&D
which at least delve a little into how different types of armor protect better
against some kinds of weapons and worse against other sorts.  Since EQ makes a
point of giving even mobs piercing, crushing and "slashing" types of attacks,
they could easily  build this sort of thing into the system, except then they'd
have to start deciding what part of the body is being hit so they could look at
what sort of armor is actually being worn; it would be unfair to give all
paladins "plate table" protection even if they are wearing small cloth armor
dropped off orcs in crushbone...
