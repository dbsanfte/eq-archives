That's because in 60 levels, I think I've spent maybe 3 levels actually 
fear kiting. It's very hard to find places where it is safe to 
fear-kite. It's usually easier to do aggro kiting- pile on the dots with 
mob snared, and let it chase you with pet on it, pet taunt off. Sit if 
it turns on the pet.
