The fact is, though the cap has only come to light in the higher 2% of
players, as time goes on, more and more people will have encountered it.
1388 extra mana today may be a little unattainable for the majority, but
look 6 months down the road.

Flowing Slime boots for 10k in bazaar as people become more FT capped.
Previously 'hard' mobs like CT reduced to Naggy/Vox or VS level for any
midsized L60 guild to kill.

People progress. The uberguild items of today will gradually filter down
to second and third tier guilds as PCs grow in strength versus static,
tactically blown open, NPCs.

Be glad that the cap was removed before you got to it, because sure as
eggs are eggs, more people will hit the old cap every day.
