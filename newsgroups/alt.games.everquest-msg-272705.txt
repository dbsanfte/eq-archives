	One reason I'm so put off by what I've heard of the new guild
perks is that IMHO what SOE needs to encourage is lots of interaction
between individual players, especially players that aren't already 
friends.  I'm of the opinion that by deliberatley encouraging the 
partitioning of a server's population into neat little tribes they
effectively remove the "massive" from MMPORG.  And I think it'll be 
particularly discouraging to new players (of which for some reason I 
seem to be seeing more of lately) because it will turn the game into 
a popularity contest.  Sort of permanent EQ rush week.
