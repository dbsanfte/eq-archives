    I explained how and why it is a self compounding effect below.

    Yup. If you took an ogre and a human and leveled them together, the
human is closing in on 32 by the time the ogre hits 30.

    The human has less distance to travel and is gaining experience faster.
That will give you a compounding effect.

    It will actually surface earlier since the human will level first every
time, but 30 is a nice round number.

    And then lightning coming out of a flying pig's butt nukes your cleric.
:(

    I get stunned once in a blue moon. It's not going to happen the second
before you lose agro often enough to stick your head in a blender and cop a
15% exp penalty. My opinion.

    And when the "robe" cops agro and starts getting beat on, I can't see
him saying "gee I wish this warrior was an ogre"

    He might think "gee I wish I hadn't nuked then" or maybe "I wish this
was a knight tanking for us", but I really can't see him screaming for you
to go and reroll an ogre warrior.

    Grouping in veksar and some AA's, followed by some LDON. I plan on
raiding at some stage but can see my STA going over 200 just from drops I
know about, that I know I can camp right now with a duo. I've got +22 left
to go from AA's, which brings me close to the point where a shammy buff will
cap me. No raiding required, not even looking into LDON drops or
augmentations.

    Well if he's your *old* main he's probably not upgrading his equipment
or gaining AA's that much?

    I think it's quite a useful word. It admits openly that what's being
stated is an opinion and that others may *argue* otherwise, but also implies
that many people would agree. This makes the point softly, without inviting
a flame war.
