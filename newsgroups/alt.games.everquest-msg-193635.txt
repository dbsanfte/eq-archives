I recently read a post about strategies for buying and selling in the
Bazaar. What do you consider the highest demand, lowest supply items that
characters are there looking to buy. Not only the high end ones, but also
the low/mid range ones. Please do not use item abbreviations, as most of
them I do not know. Thanks.
