Not all people describe God as omnipotent and omniscient.
A better partial definition might be:

God can do all things that are doable,
but can't do things that aren't doable.

God knows all things that are knowable,
but doesn't know things that aren't knowable.

If God gave us free will, our skepticism may be an example of us
exercising that free will.  And free will would make us ultimately
unpredictable, even to God, if he doesn't know things that aren't
knowable.
