Yeah, I remember that guy. My experience with him was he was rather
rude... I beleive he said at one time the whole point of his choice in
names was specificly so people wouldn't send him tells unless he sent
them a tell first. Of course, he was rather dismayed that I went
through the effort to type out his name right to send him a tell once.
I don't remember what for anymore... ;-)

I'm almost certain he was in his high 40's the last time I saw him.
But that was...god, a year or so ago.
