That is a very legitimate gripe, just not a reason to expect a res from
a GM.  I mean gripe all you want, but if the server and your client get
into an argument, the server wins.  That means that if your client
thinks you made it to the zone safely but the server says you died
before you got there, you lose.  Hell grip to the GM if it makes you
feel better, just expect the answer to be no since they can't res you
for such a thing.

Making "demands" after your request was refused is probably not a great
idea.  I mean if it was something they could help you with they would
have, if they say no its not because they don't like the way you look,
its cause they can't help you.  By calling it a "demand" I can't tell
you if you mean something like "I demand that you res me!" or "Listen
you cock sucking pile of monkey dung, if you can get your head out of
your ass long enough I am demanding a res here.  I pay your salary so
you had better do what I say or I'll have you canned you useless bucket
of vomit!!!!!!111!!!!".  The former is wrong, the latter more than
enough to earn you a warning.  Not sure which part of no you have
trouble with, but I don't think your "demand"s are going to change much
other than your account status.  Sometimes its just better to accept
things as they are.
