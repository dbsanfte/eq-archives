By the time this thing starts to proc it is almost worthless as a

good tactic to wield one of these against some of the caster mobs there.
My damage output dropped so much that I felt that I was no longer an

It sounds like you have some good ideas going. I also have a wood elf
ranger and he went thru level 18 pre-kunark, so you have alot more
options these days. I also seriously neglected my weapons skills and
realized it around lvl 18, so I had 1HS maxed, but that was about it.

Somewhere from 18-20 I has friends help me get a Sword of Morin, 6/22
with stat adds, was very nice up till mid-twenties. I also got a FS
rapier and put it in my off hand to raise my pathetic piercing, and I
think aroung level 20 I got a Dragoon Dirk and switched hands with the
SoM, to raise my skill.

My ranger was very young when the Morin Quest was implemented. Before
that you use to see many rangers with the Thulian Claw, despite its
speed, the SoM or the Silver War Axe still have better damage ratios.

I felt effective with this till about lvl 26 or 27, (and took a very
long break with this char). Around 27 I got a Icetooth claw and a PGT,
and he was back in buisness. The Icetooth Claw (11/29), enabled me to 
solo in the Lake of Ill Omen from 27 to 32, (although I spent most of 
30-34 training up my 2HB). I was never completly happy with the PGT, 
(basically I soloed with the PGT and used the SoM when I grouped), 
and I swapped between it and my SoM in my left hand until I got a Yak.

At level 34-35 I had 2 Yaks and the Icetooth Claw and was never sure
what to do, go with the Yaks or keep the Icetooth in my primary slot,
(no choice there), I would be interested in hearing opinions on this. 
At lvl 37 the Yaks start to proc so they are definatly better then.
