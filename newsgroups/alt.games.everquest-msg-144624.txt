I don't know of a spell that you can use, even with the mob targetted, that
will aggro it without having Line of sight, or being directly under the mob
(possibly above as well).  Mages(, and Wizards?) can use their collumn of
fire (whatever it's called) to aggro a mob they cannot see that is directly
above them.  You can use a ranger to track the mob, until he pinpoints it's
x,y location, then have the mage aggro it.  In CoM, this can be used to snag
a Black Reaver without a rogue to unlock the door.  It seems that VI may
have recently made a change there, as last time I was there, the Reaver
would not warp or jump down.  He eventually would just reset to his "home"
location.  I have been told that it used to work though.  It's quite
possible there are spells that can do aggro at a distance without LOS, but I
don't know what they might be.  I was able to bind my sight to the Reaver,
so I could see exactly what he was doing.  I did need LOS to do the bind,
more or less anyway.  I could jump from mob to mob with it to get to him,
even when I personally did not ahve LOS to him.  But I could not aggro him
with any of my spells, as he was out of range.
