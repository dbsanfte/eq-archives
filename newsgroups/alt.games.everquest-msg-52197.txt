Where are the spots a melee can bind?
I know my guild is friendly to Thurgadin and the dragons. where should i
hunt? to improve those factions (level 36)
what towns are there? is it possible to keep friendly with both the
Thurgadin factions and the other faction(S) mainly i want to be able to use
both towns if need be.
and i really want to go to Tower of frozen shadow what level is each floor
good for?
where do the Teachers Syslbus and students homework drop?
thats it for now
thanks
