Being underwater fatigues you (empties your yellow stamina bar).
The negative effects of being fatigued only apply if your STA
is under 100 (exception, you still can't jump when fatigued even
if your STA is 100+).  Stat loss from being fatigued with a STA
under 100 could make it more difficult to channel a spell in a
bad situation, if only because your AGI gets trashed making you
more likely to be hit.  Since casters rarely melee beyond low
levels they rarely get fatigued, except underwater.  Personally
I'd rather have my STA at 100+ than have to use a spell slot for
Invigor or Extinguish Fatigue.  ymmv.

Also, I find STA 100+ to be handy when porcupining a Druid.
