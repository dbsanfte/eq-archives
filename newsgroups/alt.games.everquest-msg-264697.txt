Noooo! Antonica and Commonlands should remain non-instanced and available 
for everyone all the time. Please, SOE, do NOT instance them. They appear to 
be making progress on this and if it continues at the current rate and there 
are enough servers at launch, this should not require the drastic solution 
of instancing the primary hunting and socializing zone for the majority of 
the population.
