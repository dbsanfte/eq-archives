As far as I remember from the sign-up, you had to check a box if you wanted 
Sony to purge the file from their database when they are done with your 
application.

It is prolly in relations that they want true betatesters, not just  
demo/preview-wanna-have, and then when reporting bugs they can match up the 
report with DxDiag file to see if problem is related to that.
