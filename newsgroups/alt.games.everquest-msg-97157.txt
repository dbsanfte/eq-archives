I always sow everyone. And, another reason druids don't cast pack
spirit is that they usually have sow memmed anyway.

Group regen if everyone is getting hit, single target if only one or
two are getting hit.As with damage shields, the single target version
is usually better than the group version, and if only one or two
really need it, you're wasting mana doing the group version.
My latest pet peeve is druids that insist on casting group shield of
barbs when only one tank is getting hit and I can (and do) easily give
him shield of thorns for 0 mana with my gloves.
