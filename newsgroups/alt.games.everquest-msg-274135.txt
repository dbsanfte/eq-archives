do I have to repeat it again?  I suppose so, thick people require that, dogs
train faster than you.  Her's a few opening ones just to start you off.

you try pulling licenses and contracts as a trump - your reply in that
showed you have no idea what even constitutes a contract.  Furthermore, you
haven't even seen the licence you're on about.

you spout off about Blizz being good, well you wouldn't know if they are
good or bad.

you go on about men putting women down, well get yourself into a
relationship for a while and you'll see that that's not always the case.
Then again you'd be the type of person which is always wanting to be put
down so as to have an excuse to whine and argue; scrap that let that poor
man have a reasonable life.

you claim to be old enough to know of the glass ceiling, but clearly have
never achieved enough for it to be a problem - am I surprised by this?  Too
bad you haven't because then you'd realise just how banal you really are.

you complain about language being offensive yet lack the
experience/education to realise that a word can be used in many ways and
each way might well have different origins.

you lack the real world experience to either be smart enough to acknowledge
something which is shown to you, preferring your own ignorance.

You lack the maturity to realise just what a liar you are when you say "I
don't  find it offensive, but other people do, that's why I'm arguing"
(paraphrased) but at the same time going being offensive to another group,
in the case christians, when it's pointed out that something you do every
post could be offensive.  You actually go on to compound it.

Again, "Their world, their
> rules". That trumps everything in this entire thread.

Are you now saying that in thr real world "pussy" can be used in non sexist
ways, but in the WoW, it's on the banned list so shouldn't be used or
circumvented?  Maybe you should read back up the post.

now just for a little more info, it was not him typing in pussy which got
him banned, you can type it in all day and not get banned.  If you actually
played the game, then you'd be able to ascertain this for yourself.

Look back and read why I thought he should be banned, then get yourself  WoW
and page a GM, wait 5 hours and you'll get a response.

you truely are wrapped up in your own self importance.  If you bothered to
read *AND* comprehend in this thread, you'd know exactly what I think should
of happened in the matter and where Blizz stands.  You lose the argument so
try and run off yet again citing "Blizzard" or pretend to know something
about contracts - I've never never seen someone so quickly show that they
know nothing at all about which they post.  Too bad you just ran into a
stone wall again.

But no, typical of the blithering idiot troll wannabe you and your ilk are,
you go on and on showing yourself to be a hypocrite and a fool.

Go back and inform yourself.

you were pegged accurately very early on, no real achievement though to peg
someone as shallow as you.

If you can't manage to find yourself demonstrating that attitude, fly home
on your broomstick.  Seeing there's no coven for you (gee I wonder why) take
consolation in your pet, black pussy cats are fairly traditional.
