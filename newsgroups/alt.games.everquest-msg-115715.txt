Okay, I'm an enchanter, just dinged 16. Offense, defense, piercing were
maxed for level 15, and I was working on 2hb. On the other hand, I *just*
got me a Student's Homework and a Opal Encrusted Stein to go along with
my Stein of Moggok.

The other int-casters in my orc highway group were mainly just sitting
around medding, stand up to cast spell, sit and med. But I was doing crowd
control, then joining in the mano-a-mano stuff when we got down to just
one critter. Do casters just give up on meleeing altogether at some point?
Is that something that happens closer to, say level 50, rather than level
16 if and when it does happen? Isn't Defense a useful skill to keep maxed?

It just seems wierd to me, giving up on combat altogether. Especially after
putting so much effort into maxing out other, "less important" skills like
Fishing and Swimming. My cleric and shaman are in their 20's and *they're*
still joining in the melee plausibly.

Is there some general advice or accepted wisdom on this matter?
