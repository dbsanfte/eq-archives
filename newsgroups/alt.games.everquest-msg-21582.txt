Yeah...We finally managed to tell the guy that he should do healing or leave
the group, as we were otherwise a very tight group and really needed the
heal. Things went fairly well until we got a very bad add to one of the next
camp pulls : at the climax of the battle, we got this memorable group tell
from the same "Cleric" : "I have to sell, brb".

Talk about a bad excuse for cowardice.

Of course we got licked. So yeah, you're right. We should have dumped the
guy first chance we got.
