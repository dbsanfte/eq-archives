Lets see..  repeatedly telling impatient people in each group what the next
step is...

Or patient people waiting until the raid leader is good and ready to tell
everybody (once) what the next step entails.  As I said previously, theres
generally a very good reason for delayed instructions (itchy fingers and
all!)

So yeah, imo it is a big deal.

If you know the instructions will be announced in good time, why must you be
pushy and press the issue?  And you know the instructions will be
announced.. by virtue of the fact your even attempting the mob shows you
have <some> leadership/communication going on.
