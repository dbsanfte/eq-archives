You don't need to tell *me* that, I myself was at various times
labeled both a VAK *and* a "game-hater who should just quit
if he hates the game that much".

But the fact that the label was too-broadly applied by some
doesn't disprove the existence of the mindset it was first 
invented to describe.

Words can be, and often are, misused, but that doesn't
change their meaning.

Agreed, but I was not labeling him a "VAK", I was pointing out
that his attitude is unfortunately a common enough one to
get its own name.  This was my not-so-subtle way of
letting Wandarr know that far from being original and
illuminating us with his profoundly pithy insight (he seemed
to be under the amusingly naive impression that after reading
his words, all of those with complaints would smack our foreheads
and go, "wow, I hadn't thought of that, yeah, I'll quit right now!),
his simplistic "solution" and attitude is instead the same old 
song-and-dance that has been performed on such a regular
basis that there's even a name for it, and it's getting old.

As an added ironic bonus, if Wandarr took offense at perhaps
being overgeneralized, then so much the better, because that's
exactly what he was doing with all the people he saw as "whiners".
Hoist on his own petard, and all that.

Sure -- if all I had done was call Wandarr a "VAK" and leave it
at that, it would be a poor rebuttal indeed.  But not only did
I not actually call him a VAK (except perhaps by "if the shoe
fits"), I spent quite a bit of verbiage explaining to him the 
logical errors in his treatise.  The VAK sidebar was just a minor 
additional twist of the rhetorical knife.
