His "complaint" is premature.

1. It's an open public beta stress test, for Tunare's sake.  Do ya
   THINK maybe possibly it's gonna be crowded?  You people ever see
   Stromm server newbie zones the first two weeks?!

2. WoW has lots, and lots, and lots of quests.  Is your quest mob
   already being camped?  Quit yer whinin' and do a different quest
   and check back on your quest mob later.

3. Ask me when I stopped counting the times I got 45% damage on a
   quest mob in EverQuest, just to have some wizzie or rogue group
   burn it down the rest of the way, robbing me of my kill.  Mayhaps
   we should give WoW a friggin' CHANCE to prove it's approach might
   work a little better.  They can always CHANGE IT (gasp!) later if
   it's not working out.

Oh, bullshit.  Credit card fees will reduce the very young population
drastically.  There are a LOT of parents that'll buy their kids Diablo
II because it's a one time charge, but won't buy them a subscription
to EverQuest.

Maybe YOU'RE the one living in a dream world.
