Cool! Good for you! I bet bards/chanters/clerics (and any others I'm not
thinking of who get the lull line) can single pull from the bandit camps.
As long as they get lucky and don't get one of those aggro-the-whole-camp
lull resists. Most everyone else just doesn't bother soloing bandit camps
because you can't make the 50' run back to the zone line.

Yep. Pretty much *all* of PC seems to have really fast respawn rate. Which,
in my opinion, is what gets you so much xp.
