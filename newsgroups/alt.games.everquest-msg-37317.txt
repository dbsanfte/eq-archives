Precisely so. I play a Paladin; I have spent entire RL game sessions
sitting in Crushbone buffing newbies and breaking up trains. I've
spent hours showing new players (those who don't beg, at least, and
some that did) how to get started, what to do, and so forth.

Could I be level 40 by now? Sure. (Well, maybe not, as long as there
are Brownie Scouts, but that's a different rant). I *think* I may have
been offered as much as 2PP, cumulatively, for any buff/heal/train
derailment services, in the last 32 levels, but I'm not doing it for
any reason other than I like helping people out. (If I were looking
for payback, I'd be running a port-taxi character). If I need income,
I'll go kill something that drops loot.

I don't think I'll ever try to be a guide however; I haven't played
all the classes and races, and most of my alts are played up to the
mid-teens, just so I get a vague feel for what other classes are
capable of and/or see some zones that a High Elf can't conveniently
visit. If someone wanted a guide's help with a cleric, monk, INT
caster or shadow knight, I'd have exactly zero useful input for him,
and for non-Elven/non-Paladin questions, I wouldn't be much more help
than "none".
