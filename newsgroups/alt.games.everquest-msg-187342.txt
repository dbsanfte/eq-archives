This is second hand info, so don't hold me accountable for the reliability.

If your building your PC, depending on how much RAM you are planning on
having, Windows versions older than XP will not recognize greater than 1 gig
of ram ( I think it was a gig).  If you put in more than that, it won't
"see" it.  In order to gain the full potential you would need to run XP to
have the computer recognize anything over 1 gig.

I was going to run Win 98 in my new box, but I plan on running more than 1
gig of RAM, so XP is the way I am going.

As far as EQ issues, I echo what has already been said,  I know plenty of
ppl running XP who have no problems whatsoever.
