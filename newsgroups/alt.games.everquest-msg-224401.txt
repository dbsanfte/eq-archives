The first time I met mobs who would fear me was in the Plane of Hate,
as it was still an outdoor zone back then people tended to have SoW
up.  After much discussion about how you should "click SoW off" so
that when feared you'd not run too far it was "discovered" that when
feared you always moved at the same speed whether SoW-ed or not.

Get your MR up and you'll break any fears that do stick after a tick
or so making it a lot less of a hassle.

Click on WALK.  You still move at a snail's pace even with Run 3.
