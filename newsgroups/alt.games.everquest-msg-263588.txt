    For guild use. I'm not a speculator, unless I see something priced so 
low I'd be foolish not to buy it and flip it.

> Is your limit still 60k?

    The officers keep pushing off my "buy now" requests. I think they want 
to just let folks get runes on their own, and not use the guild bank. Others 
on the server have been using their guild banks, which is why every so often 
you see everything below 60 get bought up.

    It's guild banks and individuals, not speculators. You'd get burned 
pretty badly if you tried to speculate on stuff which drops in many, many, 
many different places.

    I've found an area where I can get a rune or two per day in a few hours 
after raiding is over for the day. Even with that, I have a few weeks of 
farming ahead before I have even my 66 to 68 spells, and I'm just one 
person. Demand is going to last for a long, long time, especially if people 
don't go to the less visited areas of the expansion to farm nameds. Example: 
my group last night for farming was myself, a guild warrior, and his level 
69 second box elemental+ geared druid. We were clearing four named spawns, 
and were at each before PH repop. The zone we were in has several named 
spots in addition to those we were doing - we picked our cycle because it 
was easy and all four nameds were known rune droppers. We saw one person 
enter the zone during our two hours there, and they left within two minutes 
of zoning in (they likely checked ShowEQ, saw what PH's we were clearing, 
and left because the easy stuff was camped). I got a lesser rune, two 90-odd 
HP/MANA twink items and one AA, my partner got a minor rune and one such 
twink item. Where are the other people that should be in these zones?
