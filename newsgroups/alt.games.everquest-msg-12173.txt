Since I'm now halfway through 36, I can look back fondly on 35 (not!!).. :-)
I spent all of 35 in Crystal Caverns. Even in a full group, the experience
rocks. Heck, even partnered with my 45 shammy friend I was getting good exp.
The downside to CC is getting a group - usually not a lot of people in zone,
or if there are, the camps are full. But, I'm going to hang there until 40 I
imagine - good loot, relatively safe fighting, bank nearby (monk heaven). In
the right group I can get nearly a full yellow per hour fighting terrors.
Good enough for me.. and when I can't get a group I just work on my druid.
