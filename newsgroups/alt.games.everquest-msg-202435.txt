Why should a high level player's personal pecadillos define the entirety
of the game. I'e had a grand total of 3 or 4 KEIs in my entire gaming time
online - Ive never found the game boring or unbearable without KEI on any
character Ive played at any level. The low end game was however becoming
increasingly difficult with demands from groups tht I have KEI or bugger
off - fine for my ranger at lvl 46 who isnt a class likely to get told
that and can solo effectively anyway but my cleric alt suffered at lvl 25
- a year ago people would have clamoured for a cleric at any time.

Those who wish to rush to high end play have plenty of alternatives if
they dont like the low end or find it boring because they arent at uber
level or have done it many times. Howeer I fail to why their wishes should
define the game - as such while they have alternatives to rush through
evels (and its not like KEI suddenly makes it uber uber fast) including
twinking, power levelling and the extra knowledge they have aquired about
how to level and where to level plus the existence of Paludal caverns,
then nerfing KEI isnt an issue - its not like a bunch of spells in that
line have stopped working....
