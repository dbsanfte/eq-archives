I don't have a lot of evil characters, but...

You can spend time faction farming to get to the point where you're not
KOS. This might be worth it for some zones. Highpass and East Freeport are
"bottleneck zones", and being able to pass through unmolested might be
worth it. Paineel faction is easy enough to get, you might as well.
But getting non-KOS in Halas, for example, is probably not worth the
effort -- if it's even possible.

You can hunt on the moon, where race and class are almost irrelevant. This
presupposes you have a beefy enough box to do this...

Otherwise, you just have to learn a totally new set of who to avoid, and
who you don't need to avoid. Qeynos Catacombs has a bank, merchants, and
trainers, will get you to docks safely from PoK book, and you probably
start off apprehensive there. Explore the extensive tunnels under Freeport.
You can wander Grobb and Feerrott fearlessly. The Ogres in TD, the Outpost
in OT -- these are all useful places for you now. Kizdean Gix and Dragoon
Zytl are now your friends. You can camp the barbarians in Lake Rathetear
for fun and profit. Kill kitties in Kerra Isle. There are goblin banks
and merchants you may be able to use. Faydwer (except Crushbone) is one
big hunting ground for you now....

If you don't have PoP and you're playing evil, you might want to consider
buying it just for the travel convenience.
