Running through dl is really not that bad once you are familiar with it. I
would venture to say, I could run straight up the middle of the zone at
level one and not die at this point. Just dodge the mobs.

Of course I have leveled and pulled dl with quite a few characters now, but
the mobs are easily avoided if you have a sow.
