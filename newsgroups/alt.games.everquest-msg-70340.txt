This has not been my experience at all. Most of my in-game deaths have
come from overpulls by experienced players who are equipped within
their range level. Following that would be raid-related deaths, nearly
always as the result of a TPW. Then my own stupidity. Then link death.
Then trains. Then miscommunication about AFK. Then invisibility or SoW
dropping at a bad time. Twinks doing stupid things is the
Polysorbate-80 of character death.

My experience also doesn't line up with yours in terms of relative
levels of knowledge. Most twinks are played by people who have already
gotten to the 50+ game with one or more characters. They've seen these
classes played all the way to the endgame. They know the game and have
been through it at least once. I started a rogue because I admired two
players who had gotten rogues to level 55 and 60 respectively. While
playing my enchanter twink, I will have access to advice from two of
the best enchanters in the game because they will be grouped with me,
playing their warrior twink and beastlord twink.

I shudder to remember how many people I got killed because I didn't
know how to play this game with my first warrior. I was still learning
to play. He himself died more than 100 times on his way to level 27.
My new, twinked warrior has seen less than a half dozen characters die
in her groups and only once was it my fault (zone aggro in LOIO.)
