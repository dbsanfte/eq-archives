I have a question myself.

Are there any nice enchanter only sites?  Something like EQDruids?  I
know all about casters realm and the like, but I want something
specifically for enchanters.

And if there isn't a site like this, does anybody have any suggestions
for organizing a enchanters spellbook?  Enchanters get so many spells,
over such a wide spectrum of types, it's hard to get them all
organized resonably.  And I only just got 16 too.  :-)
