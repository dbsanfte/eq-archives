I have read about the technique of two players with minimal language skill
laddering each other.  But, it is awful hard to figure out who is ahead.  Is
there anyway to determine a PC skill in a language that is more granular
than awful, feeble, very bad, bad...?

I notice that in the skills window Common has a numerical value when brought
up by a class guild trainer but the other languages don't.  Common is also
different in that you can put training points into it whereas the other
languages don't allow this.  Why the disparity?

I had a more advanced PC ask me if I wanted to travel.  Since I was lusting
for Scarab Shell armor for my level 7 Halfling Druid, I agreed to go.  He
left me to fend for myself far from my home in Rivervale.  I journeyed on
from the safe haven that I was dropped off at to Crushbone to win my armor.
I was killed in an area that, body or no body, I had no business venturing.
Three stressful days of trying to get my body with no language skills made
me committed to never, never letting this happen again.  Any help and advice
on attaining language competency, will be well and truly appreciated!
