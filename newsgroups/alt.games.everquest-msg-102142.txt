Was on a bit last night, helping a guildie move some items.  We met in
Oasis.  While I was benevolently buffing and healing the lil beggars
around the dock, I couldn't help noticing one thing:  As soon as the
raft left, another one would pop up out in the water to take its
place.  Almost as if there were 3 or 4 rafts making the trip.  I don't
remember the wait for rafts being that short - has it been tweaked to
be much less of a wait?

As an aside, someone walked up to me and confessed to actually
recognizing my name from reading here!  Small world and all that, I
guess, but it was still pretty cool.  First person from this group
I've ever actually seen in game.  Pity I was just a bit too far in my
cups to remember his name...
