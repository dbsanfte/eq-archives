I've been told that all necros must either get themselves holgresh beads
(difficult/expensive as the item no longer drops) or always be stacked up
with the tinkered item with the effect: eye of zomm.

But I'm baffled as to why.

I know its a wiz spell that creates a scouting eye that monks can use to
pull with, but where does the necro fit in?

Also, I take it that the get-plat-from-it's-corpse-bug no longer works?

TIA
