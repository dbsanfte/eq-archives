With a good support team (both online and off) and some drugs I bet you 
could manage a few days.  My best is about 42 hours, but I stopped to 
sleep a few hours in the middle so it hardly counts.

I have heard it is possible to retrain your body to let you sleep in 
short naps, like a cat.  The 10 minutes in which you med from OOM to 
full can help according to 
http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,5968323%255E421,00.html 
  but I'm not sure it is really enough to do a lot for you over the long 
haul.  According to 
http://www.dayton.med.va.gov/sleeplab/abstracts/useofcaffeine.html, 
"Neither nap nor caffeine conditions could preserve performance, mood, 
and alertness near baseline levels beyond 24-hours, after which levels 
approached those of placebo."  That was without the naps though.  Hmm.

Extended sleep deprivation can cause you to see things that aren't 
there.  I have seen it happen when they messed someone's medication up 
and gave her 3 different drugs that had a side effect of sleeplessness. 
  I don't know how long it was all together, but when I saw her the 
following week she talked gibberish for 20 hours straight and had to be 
hospitalized in a straightjacket.
