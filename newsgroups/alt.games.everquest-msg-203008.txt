In the bazaar no - not unless you have processing power the like of which
even god has never seen (atomic powered perhaps :)

THere's just too many people, too much interaction being processed in the 
bazaar.

In the others possibly - I had a nightmare of a time with my SB live
soundcard not handling amibient sound properly once everything went Direct
X this meant my processor was having to either catch up or waiting on the 
soundcard (not techy enough to really decide) - put in an Audigy and bingo
major difference.

Reducing your clip plane might help though it would be a pity if you had
to - whats the rest of the system like and what internet connectivity do
you have - like the soundcard some of these can have knockon effects as
you choke various bits or the processor picks up the strain from
something. Umm what level of Nvidia Geforce is that card G2 isnt it?

I use a 32Meg version of that card and Im fine in most zones - certain
high tree ones, or ones where I can see a large portion of the zone and it
mobs and I can see a little slow down, but then my Celeron300A is a little
steampowered....

The number of luclin models may free up some resources....
