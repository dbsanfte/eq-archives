My mana regen is fine but there are always situations where mana is 
depleted... like when you do not have a cohesive group and you keep throwing 
away mana by healing someone who was just healed by a nervous druid who 
should have been leaving the heals to me. Plus in Ldons when a fool pulls 6 
and your grp is not strong enough to kill them all (with no mezzer)... 
deaths happen and Rez - Temp - Heal for them do deplete. Time is of the 
essence, and when you are soooooo close to winning, yet all the mana is 
gone, is it too much to ask... no BEG a full mana'd necro to give it up a 
little? Geez...
