Sorry to see you go.  

Unfortunately the upcoming crop of games, WoW, Doom and HL all look
like using the DX9 engine to drive their games.  This is probably the
biggest revolution in graphics that has come about in some time for
gamers.

It really is a matter of biting the bullet and buying new hardware
which can cope with this graphics overload, if you want to play these
games and I guess that now includes EQ.

Although I have had some graphics problems (mainly tearing and some
Geometry) since the patches came in my machines are running ok.  I have
two DX9 capable cards in my systems.

The latest bunch of cards from Nvidia do not cut the mustard for DX9
and this is now showing in games which are using the engine such as Far
Cry and I guess we can probably add EQ to that as well.

If you are wedded to Nvidia wait for the next bunch of cards which come
out rather than their current lot which are designed to use 16 bit
operations for DX9 (sigh).  If not, consider a Radeon which has
implented DX9 pretty well.

Good luck with your gaming ... hope you find a game that works ok with
your hardware,

regards
