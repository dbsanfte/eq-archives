You are right, I could set up rules to block over 400 lines, but then
I'd miss FAQ revisions, etc, Sometimes people don't snip, or post a long
story, I just missed that too.  Now, with OE I could set up a rule for
after it has downloaded to check the body for the various strings that
identify a Binary, but that just prevents me from being annoyed.  I use
Outlook and OE at work, so I am familiar with the rules wizards, I just
prefer to not use Microsoft for my personal work, esp since the .NET
fiasco with the Terms of Use.
