i was on legends for a month, and if you are thinking of going i would
advise against it, with a 54 clr it was almost impossible to get a grp,
because most of the zones were empty.  i saw absolutely no reason it should
cost so much.  just my 2 cents in case you were thinking of going there.
ps it was a pain trying to get my characters transferred back to their
original server
