Maybe so, but the time periods are more like up to 2 hours, a "sandwich" has
a habit of turning into "bathroom break", which eventually becomes a
"shower", followed by "nap"

Agro control for a warrior is a fucking joke, hit the taunt button and make
sure that you're in range to hit it, if you can't hold agro, bitch at the
caster for over-nuking/slowing/whatever the hell they're doing wrong.  As
for positioning, that isn't important unless it AoEs or does funky knockback
shit, and I've done a grand total of one raid on AoE things, and that was a
Vox that liked to play ping pong tank.

> Target selection is also pretty damn important, in multi-mob type raids.

HELLO OFF-TANK!!!  You so conveniently snipped out my line quoted below.
"It just isn't hard to know how to use /assist and when to off-tank"  which
it bloody isn't.

We're talking hypothetical here sir.

I understand that every class has difficulties, my point is that warriors
have it easier than healers of any sort.
