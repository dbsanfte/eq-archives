mmm....I'm definitely getting mixed messages about what to do :(
This and other threads are about evenly matched as to whether a CRT is
better for games, or an up-to-date LCD is as least as good.
As the FP monitor I was thinking about buying has a native res of 1280*1024,
there will definitely be some shennanigans going on under the hood to show
EQ at either 1024*768 or 1600*1200...I think I'll probably go for the 19"
CRT option.

Thanks for all your posts.
