  When you do a /report, it captures the last 10 lines in your chat box,
regardless of whose name you put in after /report.  You can scroll up to
capture older text.  The reason they ask you to put a name after the /report
is so the GM knows who exactly is being reported, to make analyzing the
report easier.

  According to Absor, these /reports are authenticated server side, so if
you /report someone promptly, that SHOULD work as ironclad proof that they
said the things you reported them as saying.  This, in conjunction with a
detailed /petition, should work to help get the GMs a clearer picture of
what really is happening.  Now, as someone else pointed out (I can't confirm
or deny the truth of this), Guides don't have access to /report logs (and
aren't empowered to do very much anyway), and I'm betting lots of GMs are
lazy and apathetic enough to not even bother checking the /report logs even
when they're available, over what may seem to them like a trivial little
dispute between newbies.

  Also as others pointed out, there's no such thing as "stealing" a camp.
You can only steal KILLS, not camps.  Camps don't belong to anyone,
regardless of who was there first, regardless of who can or can't handle the
camp.  But it could be considered harassment for a player to come clear a
camp of mobs just to deny you kills.  If you have documented them admiting
this with /report, it may result in some sort of disciplinary action leveled
towards that player... I don't know.  I have my doubts that GMs really take
KSing and harassment (except perhaps sexual harassment) seriously.  In my
opinion, people caught doing these things red-handed should be banned or at
least suspended after getting caught 2 or 3 times, but I have a suspicion
that it takes a bit more than that for anything other than a slap on a wrist
to happen.

  As others mentioned, the GM or Guide may tell you to split the camp, and
enforce this, but that isn't really what you want and it sounds like the
group might not have been worth sticking with anyway.  In the future, when
you are harassed, I highly recommend that you /report and /petition it.  YOU
probably won't get anything out of it, but if enough marks are put on the
offender's record, maybe other people won't have to deal with him in the
future.
