Okay, I know it's OT, and I know you'll probably think it's a flame, but I
really want to know...

Why do you use randomly capitalized words all through your document?

For example, your very first sentence:  "Allright (sic). Tunare, (the name
of the EQ Engine) Was a DirectX 5 Rendering engine From EQ Classic To
Velious".  Why are "was", "rendering", "from", and "to" all capitalized
here?  There might be an argument in favour of "engine" being capitalized
(EQ Engine), but "from"?  All through your document above it looks like you
rolled a die for each word and capitalized it if you rolled a 6.

Yours:
Allright (sic). Tunare, (the name of the EQ Engine) Was a DirectX 5
Rendering engine From EQ Classic To Velious. Sony purchased a Renderman
Middleman renderer ( www.renderman.com ), and Combined it with the existing
Everquest engine to Make Tunare 2.0, a DirectX 8 Rendering engine with
support for more Detailed Models, Textures, and Zones.

Mine:
Alright. Tunare, (the name of the EQ engine) was a DirectX 5 rendering
engine from EQ Classic to Velious. Sony purchased a Renderman Middleman
renderer ( www.renderman.com ), and combined it with the existing Everquest
engine to make Tunare 2.0, a DirectX 8 rendering engine with support for
more detailed models, textures, and zones.

So the question is why?
