Here's a good Page with info on what can and can't be grouped.

http://www.eqguild.net/macros.html

ANd the other post are corect.  The only COMAND"S that can be put on the
same line is Pause.
you can put a say in, but it makes your next 3 lines say also unles you have
specific comand tag's infrount of them.

If you are going to add a /say comand put it at the end..   It's the safe
way.

I haven't added /say's for a while so they may have changed this, but last
year it was like this will try it tonight.
