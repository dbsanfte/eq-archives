With all models enabled, all social animations on, vcache limited to
16 meg, 585 meg system ram, and conservative swap on:

Cacheman shows that at most I use 575 meg on average after done with a
session of EQ and max so far a 61 meg swap file size.

The only peformance enhancing EQ settings I have are in options:

Texturecache=true
Textures set to LOW
Dynamic lighting on.

I have a tnt 16 meg agp, p2 400, and 585 meg of ram, so except for the
ram I'm a bit behind ;)

Textures set to LOW seems to be the biggest mem saver of all.
