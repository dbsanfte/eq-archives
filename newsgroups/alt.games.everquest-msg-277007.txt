Well no, the horse is an item of equipment for the sport. The player is 
either the rider, at the lower levels, or the owner, when you get to 
serious professional riding. At the lower levels the rider needs a 
reasonable amount of skill, but the extent to which a given rider can 
achieve is enormously influenced by the quality of the horse they (or 
their parents) can purchase. A child who is merely competent can reach 
national championships if their parent can afford to buy a sufficiently 
good horse, and other things like schooling (for the horse) and training 
(for the child). Contrariwise a child, no matter how good a rider, will 
have a limit on their achievement if they cannot buy a good enough pony. 
And we are not talking abut millionaires here. A child of moderate 
competence on a �5000 pony will almost inevitably beat a child on a 
�1000 pony, however good a rider the second child may be. All this is 
true at the adult level as well, but it is less easy to see because 
adults tend not to compete if they cannot afford it.
At the higher levels the sport does indeed change - it becomes "owning a 
winner". A rich person pays for high quality horseflesh, a highly 
skilled rider and a highly experienced trainer. But again, in the game 
of being a racehorse owner, bigger money will almost guarantee victory.

That is correct, but it differs from sport to sport. The sport of 
"playing football" is almost pure skill, which is why it is universally 
popular, poor people just need a ball and they can defeat a millionaire. 
But sailing is a good example of a sport where better equipment can give 
you an almost automatic win. That's why sailing is always done in 
classes, whereby the characteristics of the boat are more or less 
rigidly laid down, precisely to ensure that skill will be given a 
chance. Golf and tennis come somewhere in the middle - better equipment 
will certainly help between players of comparable skill, but it's not 
going to make a moderate player into a champion (despite what the 
manufacturers' adverts claim). A complication here is that anyone with 
even a reasonable degree of talent is going to earn enough to buy 
whatever equipment they want - so at the higher levels equipment is no 
longer a significant factor.
The point is that in the real world there are sports where you can buy 
success, and sports where you can't, and everything in between. Whether 
this should be "allowed" in a computer game is for the publishers, the 
players and ultimately the market to determine. I would guess that the 
market will decide in favour of the people with the money.
