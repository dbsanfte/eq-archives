If you have a sharp eye for detail, you can actually match
each teleporter with the destination city by the shape of
the teleporter -- each one is in the distinctive shape
of the style of light fixtures found throughout the
matching city.

It's fun to wander around the firepot room, trying
to remember which light fixtures are found in which
cities.  You've seen some of them a hundred times,
but it can still be difficult to bring them to mind
when seen out of context.
