then willing to accept donations from the older players out there :-)

When they are polite I usually buff them if they are a low level character
(although not if they are an obvious tweak - I get annoyed when a character
whose weapon costs more then I have gained in the entire game isn't willing
to donate a couple of plat for the time and effort for a SOW)

If someone is nice enough to hail me and doesn't go into further details I
usually just hail them back and go back to what I am doing until they
actually put in the effort to ask me :-)
