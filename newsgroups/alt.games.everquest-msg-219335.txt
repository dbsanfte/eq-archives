First off I don't think it is hate motivating the jokes and jibes. 

It all goes back to the early days of EQ. Rangers were one of the most
ignored and neglected classes. Maybe because "Brad" played a Ranger
and didn't want to appear to be favoring the class. Most of the jokes
which  stem from this period were started by people playing Rangers at
the time. It was a way of directing Verant/Sony's attention to the
problems. 

Old time players (myself included) are just in the habit of poking fun
of Rangers. For me it's not personal or motivated by hate or
animosity.  I love the class, but I also love a good Ranger joke (or
any class joke)  from time to time :-)
