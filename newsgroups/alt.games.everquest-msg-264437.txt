Didn't work this way in my case. I got what should have been my Ding 7 
kill, but got the message about obtaining citizenship. I then 
continued to kill as I wanted to finish the last quest on the Island, 
but could never get a group together. The experience bars kept on 
going as normal, and at the expected ding point I again got the 
message about needing citizenship to obtain level 7. I didn't get that 
message after every xp kill as you mention. I left the island at this 
point, went to Qeynos, did the citizenship quest and dinged 7 only. 
Not 7 and 8 like you and Bob did. I guess the mileage varies.
