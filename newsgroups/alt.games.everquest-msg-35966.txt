Thanks to this board, I found eq.castersrealm.com.  I have been searching it
and found something called Crazy Cleric armor.  The site doesn't provide any
direction as to how or where to obtain it.  I am interested in the helm.  The
stats are as follows:

Classes:  Clerics
Races:  Humans, Erudites, Gnomes, Halflings, Dark Elfs, High Elfs, Half Elfs,
Dwarfs
Stats:  35 AC +25 MANA +20 HP +10 CHA +10 WIS +5 SV COLD +5 SV FIRE
Special Attributes:  MAGIC, LORE
Slot(s):  Head Slot
Weight:  1 Stone
Effect:  Ultravision  

Any ideas?
