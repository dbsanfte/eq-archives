Snip

Actually I run win 98 regular, patched all the way up, and
don't notice much diff when I multiboot to xp to play EQ in there
instead. I have no soundcard issues in XP, using the sb pci 128 
ensoniq chip drivers that xp automatically installed, which are fine.

Basically once in EQ, I could easily forget what operating system I'm
in. The only difference is when I get out of EQ and open up cacheman
I see that in win 98 (remember, this is with same settings in EQ) I
uses 576 meg of 576 meg of system ram about, while using near 400 meg
of a 750 meg min/max swap file (with such optimizations as vcache
limited to max of 90 meg, etc)

Meanwhile in XP, at pretty much default settings, opening up cacheman
after EQ shows that I used 476 of 576 system ram and only about 41 meg
or so of the cache. So on the surface at least Xp seems to be running
EQ just as well with not nearly full system memory use and very low
cache use? The only thing I can think of is that it is managing memory
better?

I was doing quite well with EQ in XP until I made the mistake of
installing the beta 30.30 nvidia xp drivers. They seem to have hosed
XP quite well, giving me tons of blue screen errors. They also seem to
have no real uninstall method that works well and even though I did
several uninstall attempts and deleting of registry enteries, I still
have the problem. I even went back to the nvidia drivers I had before,
the certified ones which worked, and reisntalled them but am still
screwed. Looks like I'll be reinstalling XP for the third time..
bahha.

I don't get system restore either, its supposed to be BETTER than
older options yet, as in this recnet case, it doesn't work. I tried to
system resore and it says it is then upon rebooting I get a message
saying that it couldn't. I miss the way 98 does it where you just do
scanreg on boot and pick an earlier registry save.
