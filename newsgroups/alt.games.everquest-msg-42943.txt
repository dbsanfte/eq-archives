I'm 42nd level and certainly up to this point I have loved (almost)
every minute of it.

I can find a group whenever I want. Admittedly I'm in a guild and
there's ALWAYS something going on that I can join. But for pickup
groups, a druid brings so much to the table: healing, damage shields,
buffs, nukes, dots, and evacs for when things go wrong. Pick your zone
right and you'll find groups.

If your goal is to reach 40 quickly and you can stomach soloing,
you'll find 35-40 just fly by. I tried quadkiting near the end of 35.
I did 36 in 2 days, 37-39 in a day each, 40 in 3 days and 41 in a day.

In large groups the experience slows down considerably (from what I've
seen so far) but is a lot of fun. I solo to level and group to enjoy
the game.

Certainly druids make phenomenal porters -- I've picked up guild
mates, healed them to full, sowed and buffed them, then ported them to
their destination. Wizards aren't quite so flexible. :-)

At the higher levels druids have do problems with groups. I know a 55
druid and she has complained to me about that exact issue.

Hope some of this helps.
