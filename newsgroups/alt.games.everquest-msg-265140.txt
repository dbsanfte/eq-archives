I have been through 6 "nights" of this Halloween Madness and I have yet to see
any good drops - I get bone chips and tarnished weapons. I have only seen one
leuteinent (sp?) in these nights and no commanders  Lots of conscripts and foot
soldiers. I have fought near  the POK book and around the wayfarer camp and
west of it but before the guards. Any suggestions of where I should fight. I
would like one good drop before this ends
