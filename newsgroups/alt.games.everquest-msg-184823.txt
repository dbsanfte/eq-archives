I've noticed very little difference.  MAYBE I can single pull some few
things that a 60 can't, but besides that, nada.

Now granted, a level 61 enchanter is a god with their new spells, so there's
no way in hell I'll delevel again, but that's really the only difference.

Next HoT run I'm going to tell them I want to be picker.  I play a gnome and
I can stand behind the fire pot and pull him right to where he needs to be
with tash.  Then between Bedlam and Arcane Rune that's a total of 2350hp
damage absorber plus my 2800hp...that's lots of time for the MT to get aggro
from me, especially when I cast Boggle (serious hate reducer) a time or two
(we're new to HoT and we're having trouble with the MT being placed in the
right spot...).
