While this is true, its incomplete.

Spell haste is not merely enchanter/shaman/beastlord.  Most cast hastes are
"spell haste," including cleric Yaulp V, and (this will surprise you) most bard
hastes.

Yes I said bard hastes.

Even though you see "song haste" as stacking with "spell haste" and "item
haste", not all bard songs that have haste count as "song haste", in fact only a
few do.


The following songs count as "spell haste" and do not stack haste effect with
other "spell haste" songs or buffs from other classes
They are also limited, in that item haste plus spell haste cannot exceed a
certain limit (100%?  Dunno this one, I'm embarassed to say) just like all other
"spell haste" buffs.  Of course this only presents a problem with high end haste
items and high end bard hastes, other class hastes are better and so hit the
wall sooner.

Jonathon's Whistling Warsong (16-35% self only)
Anthem de Arms (10% group)
Villa's Verses of Celerity (20% group)
McVaxius' Berserker Crescendo (20% group)
Jonathan's Provocation (45% self only)
Verses of Victory (30% group)
Vilias' Chorus of Celerity (45% group)
McVaxius' Rousing Rondo (22% group)
Jonathon's Inspiration (61% self)
Warsong of Zek (60% group)

These songs are the ones that count as "song haste" which means they stack with
spell haste and item haste. Further, you can exceed the "spell haste plus item
haste" limit via these songs by up to their full amount.

Melody of Ervaj (5% group)
Battlecry of the Vah Shir (15% group)
Warsong of the Vah Shir (25% group)
Composition of Ervaj (10% group)
Rizlona's Call of Flame (30% group)

A bard that sings Verses of Victory and Vilias' Chorus of Celerity will be
hasting their group 45%, not 75%.

A bard that sings Melody of Ervaj and Battlecry of the Vah Shir will be hasting
their group 15%, not 20%.

But a bard that sings Vilias' Chorus of Celerity and Battlecry of the Vah Shir
will be hasting their group 60%, not 45% or 15%... and if some members hit the
cap with just VCOC and their item, they'll still get the full extra 15% from
Battlecry.

Now the reason you see songs from the "spell haste" category as stacking with
"buff" hastes is that most of these songs have other effects as well, even
though you use the best haste available to calculate your haste, the songs don't
bounce off because their other buff portions still work.

Thus Rob's point was that with no chanter haste (almost certainly better than
the 30% that VOV will put out) its better to get the extra 8% haste, but with a
chanter haste on, then take the 22% haste (which won't count) but extra attack,
str, and DS from MRR.  Which is obvious and doesn't speak to my question really,
but thats another issue.

Llyric
ps another is why any bard with MRR would ever consider singing VOV instead of
VCOC...
