Make sure you have DirectX 9c loaded.

Make sure you have the latest drivers for your Video Card. This is
tricky with mobile Radeons, because many laptop makers never put out
new drivers. You will need to install the Omega Drivers. These are
"hacked" drivers that allow you to run the latest ATI Catalyst drivers
on mobility cards. Omega drivers work great and will improve
performance in all of your games on the laptop.
