I nuke a lot,have 145 AAs,SCF5 atm,planning to get all the SCF AAs.
Mostly I am fm,even in highest level zones that are in my reach at 66
like DoNs with level 70 groups or MPG.I know someone will come
and say the group is pulling too slow,but realistically there are
always short breaks between pulls.
This leads back to the point of my initial post,by raising the level
cap to 70 and give Clerics only useless spells,SOE found a way
to make Clerics less powerful for some time.Surely my 66 Cleric
is much more powerful,than a sucker 70 Cleric with no AAs and
the crappy 66+ spells.(66 fast heal comes to my mind especially,
awful mana/hps-healed ratio)

Very true,I melee a lot,since the Ward of Venegance line I could even
tank if the groups would let me.  =)
