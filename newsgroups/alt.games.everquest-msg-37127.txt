<devils advocate>

There are certain times when a SoW could be considered "desperately needed".
Case in point (true story):

I'm fighting in LOIO. I die, but it's no biggie cause I'm bound in FV. (I'm
a warrior, BTW). So, I start running down the shoreline, then following the
river to the LOIO zone. Then I get jumped by a weblurker (silkskulker, or
whatever those drider looking things are). Mindset is to just keep running
to zone, right? Kinda hard to do when you're stunned. Or rooted. So I die.

Zone into FV docks. Decide to make the run again (like I have a choice).
Same thing happens. I did my best to avoid the driders, but there are a lot
of rocks to negotiate around that river, and normal running doesn't cut it.
I die. Again.

Now I've lost about two hard earned gold bubbles, so I ask for a SoW. I even
go to the bank first and withdraw some money to donate. A friendly druid
gives me a SoW, didn't even ask for a donation. (I gave it to him anyway).
Then I run like the wind for LOIO. This time I'm able to keep out of the
driders way, and even outrun the goblin that agroed me.

And in case you're thinking, "just ask for an invis", the driders can see
invis. I don't know what level these things are, but I got a level 50 friend
who's afraid of these things.
