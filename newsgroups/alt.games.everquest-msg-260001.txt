I don't understand why the people who aren't getting a reward are 
hitting the mob for the person who is, in the scenario described.

If they were grouped, sure.

If they had decided on a community level that its best to help each 
other even though they aren't grouped, and take turns getting the 
credit, ok.

But when its a pure every man for himself race to see who hits it first, 
well hell, you pulled it you kill it would be the attitude I'd expect to 
see... locking the mob shouldn't really be much of a concern as I'd 
think the effect would be a lot like it was locked anyway.
