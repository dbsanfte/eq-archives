Wow. You must be a helluva lot of fun at parties. "Hey, hey! That guy
over there didn't put his drink on a coaster! You, hey you! I saw you
take two hors d'oeuvres! Who's puttin' their Kools out on my carpet?
WHO'S putting their Kools out on my carpet?" How can a fucking name
"bother" you? Do you rip pages out of the dictionary because there are
words that "bother" you and you don't want to have to deal with them?
Relax. You'll live longer and have more time to play EQ.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
