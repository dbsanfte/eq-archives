About the best weapon for that level to get is a Cracked Staff. Orc Pawns
and Skellies have those sometimes so kill any stick-wielding mob you see.

For armor:
First armor: Cloth armor pieces that drop off the orcs. good enough to last
till level 10 or so.

Second armor:
Go to www.eqtraders.com or www.lokari.net and print the tailoring guides for
basic, silk and leather.

Now go buy a large tailoring kit (couple of pp, kill pawns and skellies for
weapons and sell those).  Kill every spiderling, wolf, spider, bear and/or
just about anything that can drop some tailoring supplies and get your skill
up (spider and spiderling silks combined to threads and swatches are best
because they never fail). When you think you're ready start making Raw Silk
armor.

My newbie mage had a complete set around lvl 10 which replaced the cloth he
had, but YMMV

This stuff is good enough to last till 20 or so I think, but between 10 and
20 you usually get a few upgrades here and there. Flowing Black Robe and
Green Silken Drape are good robes to save some cash for, spend the rest on
jewelry with +mana and +int and of course spells.

After lvl 20 it usually depends on where you are hunting and how much cash
you've saved already. You might want to start doing some of the Sol Ro
quests if you have a few friends, I still use those boots at lvl 55
(insta-petkill, mage musthave!). But that's all a long way from where you
are now. Stick to cloth and raw silk, you shouldn't get hit much after lvl
12 or so.
