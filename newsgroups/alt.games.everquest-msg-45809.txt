I got kicked out of game and have not been able to get back in.  All
my conections are fine as far as I can tell.  I figure it must be
them.  I was in a group in Ferrott at time and we started roping out
one at a time I was last one to go from my vantage.

I was fairly certain  that there would be something like this happen
today.  I have gotten my first day off in the past 3 weeks.  Took
the wife out to dinner and she was nice enough to let me get on to
get my Bard to get him his last yellow and a half so he can get to
hell 45 and group with some people I work with to get our "Ogre
patrol"  a level or 2 tonight  ;-)
