And because they're a minority group, they have no right to protest? 

And different minority groups have no right to gather together and
complain about the problems in general?

I'm not talking about calling VI's momma rude names, I'm talking about
the attitude you (and others) are taking that just because the problems
don't effect you or a number of your friends, they either don't exist,
or aren't down to VI. Even if only 10% of the populous have problems,
thats 40,000 people. I suspect the percentage is much much higher. Sure,
10% is a small minority, it's still a HUGE number of people, spending
large amounts of cash on an expansion and PC upgrades they have every
right to expect to work. There is no disclaimer on the box to my
knowledge saying: "We accept no responsibility for the game ceasing to
work for less than 50% of subscribers, due to our sloppy programming,
rushed deadlines, or lack of testing, or combination thereof"

As for complaining; time and again, Verant has drummed into us that the
squeaky wheel gets the oil. You *have* to kick up a huge stink for them
to look at things, otherwise they just carry on staring through their
'Working as intended' goggles. And no, I'm not saying, 'VI SUCK DONKEY
BALLZZZ!', because they are obviously aware of the significant problems
and are working on them. Even they admit there are problems worth
working on, only a few people (like you) lay the blame at the user's
door.

Not all the people having problems are computer noobs trying to run on
the store-bought 3-year-old PC which they've never opened the box of.
Dismissing things like that is, frankly, and insult. Hence the hostility
you are getting by trying to palm it off
