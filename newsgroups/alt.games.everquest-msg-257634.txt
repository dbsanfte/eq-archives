    My experiences in doing LDoN's as a cleric, and I did a lot of them, is
that there is a large percentage of players that think they need
temp/virtue regardless of what class they play.  I would always temp the
tank and enchanter, then ask if anyone else wanted it.  The vast majority
of the time, most of the other players in the group responded that they
did.  Of course, the vast majority of the time, the vast majority of the
players felt that it was cleric duty to provide the buff for free. 
Repeatedly, if needed.

   I know I'm going a bit off topic, but this was something of a sore spot
for me.  I got real tired of people begging me to join their group, demand
that I spend 60 or so plat for the privilege, then act like I was some sort
of cheap bitch for daring to suggest that it might be nice if I got some
sort of compensation for the buffs.  I never suggested that I get all the
gem drops, and to be fair most groups would automatically hand over any
peridots that dropped.  But all I ever wanted was the value of the dot's I
burned, and a large portion of people acted like I was way out of line for
suggesting that.

   It just got more than a little irritating to either play hardball all
the time, or turn marshmallow and pony up the buff like a good bot and shut
up about it already.  If it were not for this factor, I might have thought
about rolling up a new cleric on a different server, and maybe still be in
the game (big maybe, but still).
