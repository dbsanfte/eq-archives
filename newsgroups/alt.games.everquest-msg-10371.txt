You can check with the terms of your agreement with your ISP to see what is
allowed. Bell Atlantic (now Verizon) used to say you couldn't share, now
they say it's allowed but they won't offer technical support for setting it
up (or fixing problems, I guess).  You do only get one IP address though.
While I don't run 2 copies of EQ, I do have a desktop and laptop sharing my
DSL connection. I use the Intel Anypoint wireless network, which is
peer-to-peer. It works fine for looking up EQ info while I'm playing, or
answering email, or whatever.
