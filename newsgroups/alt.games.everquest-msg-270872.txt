Surely I will not wait 12 months until the game becomes
playable again.

I play with some regularity on AB and SolRo,number of 
traders is half of what it used to be half a year ago.
Sadly some days ago in the afternoon I saw an all time low
of players in PoK for this time on AB,there were only 16
(sixteen) players! Usually there were at least 50 players
at every day- or night-time
My level 67,200 Ranger feels again like being level 60
without any AAs,nearly impossible to find a group since
EQ2 and OoW,again its pure luck when I find a group,often
I log after spending 1 or 2 hours vainly running around lfg,
and solo Murkglider shooting  in NC gets old really fast,when
you cant  see your xp bar move after 4 or 5 kills,not that I play
a MASSIVEMULTIPLAYERonlineRPG to solo.

What is beyond me is,that SOE didnt foresee this situation,
now they are in loss-loss situation.
By cannibalizing EQ1 for EQ2,they will loose additional customers
to other games (maybe its no coincidence that you can play AO for free
now,a lot of discontinent EQ1 players around ,and they will loose more
EQ1 players when WoW will be released outside the US)by the fact,that
EQ1 is not longer fun because of the unreasonable amount of time
needed now to find a group.
I would be very curious of some numbers how much active accounts
both games totally now have.I would guess not more than EQ1 at its
best times.But now they have TWO developing teams and TWO
serverfarms and the same revenues as with only ONE game.
I really cant understand a businees politics that harms both sides,the
players and the company.
If they really want EQ1 to die,a much more honest and efficient  way
would have been to shut the EQ1 servers down the day EQ2 was
released,and let the EQ1 players migrate to EQ2 without the need to
buy a new software,after all the EQ1 players financed the developement
of EQ2 with their monthly fees;it really makes me angry that Sony
tries to collect from me TWICE.
