What up dawg.

Rune is arse now, do you agree? 

I hope my brief sabatical has not caused a sense of hostility or mistrust 
from thee. Prithee we can all be friends and drink battery acid merrily 
while exposing our phallic devices to earn free User-IDs on the EverQuest 
thing... Wait that was my idea. Dunno if it worked or not. Someone burn 
me Everquest and tell me my name and I shall find out if it did.

Morte Alla Italia Francias Anela 
"Death to the french is Italy's cry"

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

"What a punk. I bet he likes to lick chiclets and put them up his nose.
Indeed."- DKA with a hilarious quote on the USENET doormat that is Alex 
Cain.
