Nah, sorry.  You're not known to me, and I've seen no one else vouch for
your credibility (no one I consider credible anyway <g> ).  I'm not saying
that your claim is untrue, only that I cannot believe it without credible
backup.

More likely you either signed onto the wrong server OR you qualified for
having your characters wiped.  One such example would be demanding a refund
at the beginning of the year due to Velious bugs.
