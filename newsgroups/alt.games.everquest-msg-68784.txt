About 80% of the time when I zone I get thrown back to the server selection
screen since luclin. IS anyone else having this happen to them? This is all
zones.

I was just putting up with it, but since I got the boat from freeport to
butcherblock it became an issue becuase I couldn't get off at either end, it
crashed and by the time I got back on I was in oot again.
Got a port out in the end, but it was a major pain.

Is anyone else seeing this?
Going to do a complete reinstall of my machine today as I got a new hard
disk so may that will fix it.
