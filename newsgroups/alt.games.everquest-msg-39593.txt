This has been bugging me for a few days now.  I'm a newbie (I'm using MSOE6,
how knowlegable can I be, right?) who just started an Erudian cleric of
Prexus.  The first newbie quest I get sends me to the sewers (catacombs,
aquaducts, whatever) of Qeynos.  I find Bait Masterson, hand him my newbie
robe and in return I get a broken fishing pole, right?  Wrong.  I got a
regular fishing pole.  I handed it back to the NPC who gave me the quest and
I think she said something like "A gift for the needy?  Thankyou."

So I'm out a newbie robe.  No big deal, really.  Just a pain to replace at
lvl 1... but enough ranting...

This left me wondering if I'd missed a step and if so what was I supposed to
do that I didn't?

A nameless (and now nekid) lvl 1 cleric
