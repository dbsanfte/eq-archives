One misspelled word. Well, depending on which side of the pond you learned 
English anyway.

As to the problem, you can select from a wide variety of fonts now, some 
will be more legible.  You can also set colors of important things so that 
they stand out for you.  You can set the font size, not sure how much you 
can change it now.  Lastly, reduce the resolution that you play at to 
increase the effective size of the fonts as well.
