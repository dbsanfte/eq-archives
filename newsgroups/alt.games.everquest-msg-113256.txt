This tells us exactly what type of person you are Dennis. The best of us go
look for a good place to exps find it and call friends. We then happily camp
pulling to our hearts content untill we are done. Later we may discuss it
and have others hear . They then hear of both the good camp and perhaps how
to break it. Then they FOLLOW and eventually that place gets overcamped. If
you get to somewhere overcamped, its not hard ,you leave.

There is always a good place to pull continously and get constant
experience. The trick is to find it . You will never find it waiting for
others to tell you where it is except through sheer luck that nobody happens
to be home today. I am still suprised at how camped acrylia is becomming.
The mobs there are nasty casters and tend to also have harmtouches . They
have such a high ac that melee would never be interested in the exp grind
there. Yet the numbers of clerics, chanters, and wizards who appear in this
zone are increasing daily.
