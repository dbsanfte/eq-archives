Just started a Vah Shir Bard a week ago and am using Scorpialis... 
That's the weapon, the little bugger is named Tailfang and the shaman 
under the bridge (I forget which one) will give you the dagger for the 
tail he drops.  The hardest part I've found is getting the femur bones, 
mostly because Grimling Skeletons are hard to find, and then they only 
drop the femur about 1 in 5 or so.  And yeah, these guys are fun... 
completely the opposite of my cleric.  The weapon I think is 4/23 with 2 
Poison Damage.
