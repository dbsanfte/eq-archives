1hb - more common to find WIS 1hb items.
1hs - The epic quest weapon, and a few very nice velious weapons are 1hs

I used a BEM for the longest time - no stats, but nice damage/delay
ratio. Went to a splintering club after (+ to wis). My 1hb is now maxed
at 175 (max for melee weapons for any of the healers is 175). My 1hs is
around the 120's, and I need to work it up somehow (probably practice
points, got lots of those left) if I ever decide to do the epic weapon
quest.

Try to keep both 1hs and 1hb maxed until late 20's. You should be able
to manage that, and you can use the extra time to figure out which you
want. 1hb probably gives more immediate benifits, but 1hs is not to be
overlooked.
