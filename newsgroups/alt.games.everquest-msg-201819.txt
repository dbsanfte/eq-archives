High school friends when D&D and role playing were relatively new,
back in late 70s. Sad part is time doesn't allow me and others to play
it and the few times I did it never seems to capture those years.

Sadly EQ is beginning to hit that wall for me like D&D.  Friends are
moving on and the game has lost that "new experience" wonder of being
a new player in a fresh experience.

I will have many nostalgic feelings for Eq as I do for the old days of
roleplaying but sadly you never seem to be able to recapture thaat
experience. I'm hoping EQ2 will do this because EQ is becoming to time
intensive to get my character to a higher level with higher gear (sat
in HoT for 18 hours and had nothing for my trouble; thanks but no
thanks).
