I started LDoN at 56/57.  I've gotten 15-16% on a handful of occasions,
depending on how much of the 90 minutes we used and if we spent the
additional 30 minutes xping.  I consider 12% to be good and am generally
satisfied with 10%, which is a given except for those adventures that get
completed in 40 minutes and we leave to get another one.  I always adventure
with the same group and I tend to be towards the lower level in the group.
One of the higher level characters in the group mentioned that he gets a lot
more experience when he adventures with a certain crew of all 65's (he's 62)
instead of our normal group (where he's tied for the highest level).  For
the time invested, LDoN is not great experience, except it 1) manages to get
us all together, 2) offers the distraction factor, and 3) means no hassles
with getting to the camp or finding it taken, 4) tends to offer consistent
experience for the time invested as I level towards 60 and beyond (instead
of my normal grind of having to kill more and more of mob "X", i.e. guards
in Katta, as I level).  Leveling 51 to 60 is a pain in butt almost any way
you slice it, 55-60 doubly so.
