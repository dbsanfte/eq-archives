Race is a VERY useful identifier when practicing medicine.

Some races are more susceptible to certain diseases and conditions
than other races.  For true genetic reasons, not just due to poverty
or living conditions, etc.

In fact, there are even some diseases that some races are immune
to and others are not.  Again, for genetic reasons.

Beware anti-racism.  It's just as blind as pro-racism.  It's okay
that we're all different.  Really.
