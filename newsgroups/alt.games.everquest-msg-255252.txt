Invisibility (worn) would be a sweet effect indeed for a puller; you 
break invis to throw, but are invis again by the time the axe hits the 
target, so only the target "see's" you, you're still indiff to 
everything else.

Closest thing to this is the pre nerf circlet of something or other, 
which is insta click for SK and Necro... WORN would be nicer, and 
presumably the thing is all/all...
