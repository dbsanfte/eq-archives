I did a /report and /petition on this today:

[Tue Jul 16 15:37:10 2002] Zuusha says out of character, 'and the point of specing
is to customize your character'
[Tue Jul 16 15:37:11 2002] Gavity says out of character, 'i wonder if a gm will
pop up soon and tell us to stop badmouthing this game?'
[Tue Jul 16 15:37:27 2002] Zuusha says out of character, 'unlike this shithold
game where upper spells go to the highest bidder'
[Tue Jul 16 15:37:41 2002] Zuusha says out of character, 'Fuck the Gms they can
all lick my scrotum'

I had just logged into Field of Bone and that's the first
thing that popped onto my screen.  Charming.

He then proceeded to spend the next 40 minutes /ooc'ing about
how stupid EQ was and how great DAOC was, and how EQ players were
likely fat and pimply, and how if we met him in real life we'd
piss ourselves, yadda yadda yadda.

    [Tue Jul 16 15:57:40 2002] Zuusha says out of character,
     'admit it you are a spinless jackass with delusions of
     grandeur, wou likes to sound tough on a video game. you 
     probably scour the interned looking to pick up fat lonely 
     women'

Etc.    Before long most of the zone was involved.  He told 
us to come to NYC and he'd "kick our asses".

    [Tue Jul 16 16:07:09 2002] Zuusha says out of character,
      'I will gladly meet any one, I alive in Brooklyn but
       will gladly travel to any of the 5 boroughs to kick
       the shit out of one or all of you feebs asses'

This went on interminably, so I finally called his bluff:

     [Tue Jul 16 16:09:28 2002] You say out of character, 
       'Ok, let's do the next best thing -- Zuusha, call 
       me at [my real phone number].  I'll bet you sound 
       pre-pubescent'

     [Tue Jul 16 16:10:16 2002] Zuusha says out of character,
       'I dont call children, thats for cousin kissing 
       pedophiles like Gavity'

     [Tue Jul 16 16:10:28 2002] You say out of character,
       'Oh, your parents won't let you call long distance, eh?
       Case closed.'
     [Tue Jul 16 16:10:56 2002] You say out of character, 
       'Yeah, he'll "kick yer butt" in RL, but he doesn't 
       dare make a phone call.  *plonk*'

     [Tue Jul 16 16:11:21 2002] Gavity says out of character, 
       'and we have a winner'

     [Tue Jul 16 16:12:08 2002] Zuusha says out of character,
       'look I am not going to waste my time belittling some 
       pimply faced tart on the phone, if you live in NYC 
       area thats a different story '

     [Tue Jul 16 16:12:47 2002] You say out of character,
       'Let's have a show of hands -- who believes Zuusha's 
       excuse for not phoning me?'
     [Tue Jul 16 16:13:06 2002] You say out of character, 
       '<crickets chirping>'

He wound down real fast after that, and he was no more
trouble.

Sure, I could have /ignored him, but it was more
fun squashing him like a bug.
