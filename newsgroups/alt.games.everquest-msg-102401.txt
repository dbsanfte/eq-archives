Yeah, but NYC implemented their "very restrictive handgun purchase
laws" in 1911 (the so-called "Sullivan Law").  So apparently
strict gun control laws take what, 80 years to start showing
positive results?  ;-)

Actually, you'll note that I didn't draw any conclusions, I
merely made an observation.

The reason I did so was to head off *other* people from leaping
to conclusions, and/or to defuse conclusions that other people
(*cough*gun-control-lobbyists*cough*) have already expressed
about the results of the DC ban.  For example, HCI et al like
to endlessly cite the 1991 NEJM Loftin study of the aftermath of 
the DC ban in order to claim "success", despite the fact that
the Loftin study (I own a copy) "conveniently" uses a
time window that stops just short of the year when DC's
crime rate skyrockets, *and* uses a grade-school level
"analysis" method (e.g., "average everything before the law
was passed, then average everything after the law was passed")
that hides the fact that DC's homicide rate had dropped during 
the two years PRIOR to the enactment of the ban, and instead 
makes it appear that the drop coincides with the implementation 
of the ban.  In actual fact the DC homicide rate maintained 
its pre-ban level for a few years, and then skyrocketed to 
almost triple its prior rate.

The one conclusion that is safe to draw is that the aftermath of
the ban hardly fulfilled the glowing promises made by its 
supporters.

No argument there.
