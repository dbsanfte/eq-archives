> goddamnit you guys, they said the MOB SPEED WILL NOT BE CHANGED

> what part of MOB SPEED WILL NOT BE CHANGED is so fuckin hard to
grasp??????

Heh not hard to grasp at all that they said that . They are lying though .
Mobs do not all move at the same speed now . Even if every mob they added
henceforth moves at exactly the same speed as every other there will still
be huge advantage in killing those preexsisting mobs that are dangerous now
because of their speed :p

That being said I want to spend my 60k and get a pegasus . I like levitation
:) I even promise not to ride it in s karana .
