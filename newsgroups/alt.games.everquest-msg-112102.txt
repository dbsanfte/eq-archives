It'll be put into the bank for him so he'll have it when he
switches faction, of course.   We don't expect our mages
to stay on CoV forever and it'd be unfair to deprive them
of Velious armor since they're helping the guild as much
as the people actually killing mobs in ToV.   So we're
putting a full suit of drops into the bank for eventual MQ
with them once we no longer need them to stay on CoV
faction.
