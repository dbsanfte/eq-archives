By the sounds of it.. you guys are perhaps not killing something else that
could "impact" the final fight.. /cough

I like number 2 (glorification), its loot is pretty decent (some fucking
asstastic loot drops in the others, thats for sure), and the difficulty
isn't really high.

They aren't the only mobs capable of leaving the ring.  Infact, the ravs
guardians at the very begininng leave the ring quite easy and willingly too!

.. nope, they don't.

Uqua has been retuned again on test too (dunno if you keep up with the zones
status).. man that zone can teach you a thing or 2 about brutality (even in
comparisson to the rest of GoD)

Its kindof crappy in a way.. uqua isn't supposed to be harder than ikkinz
raids, its not the next tier.. just a side road..
But it was SO hard (still unbeaten/unkillable, game-wide), it really fired
people up.  Im in a endgame-only board/channel, and there has been a lot of
discussions about the harmful effects of GoD on guilds turnout.. guilds
going from 60-70 to 30-40 people on a good night, some pretty major guilds
perhaps wondering when the end is near and so on.

We never got hit to the extent that a lot of them did. I mean we did have
our number 1 pali, number 2 warr, other random classes quit the game, which
hurt moral and raid numbers considerably.  Uqua though.. well theres
something about 1 misclick, 1 foot too far forward, 1 over zealous non-tank
that causes an instant wipe which people seem to relish.  The first time we
killed the rage and fury behomoths people felt a way that they hadn't in a
long long time in EQ.  It ignited some kind of raw passion thats been
missing for a LONG time for a lot of us heh.

Death and CR's are never far away in there (mobs spawn upon every pc death..
so just 1 fuckup causes a massive snowball effect).. there is a buzz in our
raids as a result now.  So whilst a nerf is probably good in terms of
speeding up progression, its a little sad that the sheer insane difficulty
which gave people a desire to win is gonna be diminished.

Enjoy Uqua 4.0 or whatever version were about to get today.. you really
missed out on the fun (and many, many deaths) that previous ones delivered
:(

40hp isn't too bad of an upgrade.  Its more than I can gain from upgrades
that exist in GoD atm =p
And definately not something to feel indifferent about when it rots !!!

But do you know what you will do with said quest drops? :-)
