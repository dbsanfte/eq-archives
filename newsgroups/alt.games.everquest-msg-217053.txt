I played a cleric to 47 and now play a BST who's in his mid-50s so I know
what both sides of this debate feel like. And there is no debate whatever:
whether its evac'ing or simply running to the zone, when the cleric says
"go" we go. From very early on in EQ I was taught as a cleric to take charge
of this: "Cleric, how's your mana?" "Cleric's call on when to bail", etc.
Melee classes who don't understand or accept that are simply people not
worth grouping with anymore, cause you can't trust their judgement enough to
group with them.

Be a take-charge cleric and have no apologies. The players you'd want to
group with will want to group with you.
