Since it's not clear exactly who or what your intending to reply to,
I'll snip what you quoted below and just reply to your post.

I'm glad to hear that you've enjoyed playing and feel good about what
you've done in-game.

There is no shortage of such folks in-game or IRL.  You aren't going
to find a massively multi-player like EQ without such people in it.

Nope, there are many like you, some come here to share information.

That's a very sad story, if I'm understanding it correctly.

I don't think it's as rare as 1 in 1000.  At various times I have
helped others, or been helped by others, without any compensation
being involved.  And nearly every other player I've gotten to know
in-game has told similar stories.  Also, we see stories like that
posted here from time to time.  This sort of thing is a big part of
what makes EQ a great experience for many players.

I do not understand what you are trying to say there.

> help someone in need ? 


Many of the folks who post here would likely help somebody in need.
The hostility often expressed here towards the parasites who try to
use (or more accurately, abuse) other players' kindness to gain
unearned advantage or advancement, is not the same as a meanness of
spirit you seem to be seeing among us.

> I think I know the answer to that one. 


If I am inferring correctly that you believe the answer to be "no",
then I think that you are incorrect.

Yes, it often is.


> Sorry spoke my peace Tired of hearing that I bought this character


Some of us are more suspicious than others.  If you are patient, I
think you will find that this is actually a pretty good group.  I've
learned a lot here.


> Happy Hunting, Be Safe and HAVE FUN


And the same to you!
