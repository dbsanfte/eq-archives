No, it's my reaction when someone's reasoning is totall asanine.
Humans are animals. Animals kill to survive, whether it's plant or
other animals. Cutting out one of the two for any reasons other than
health reasons is pointless. Besides, those vegitables you eat were
grown on farmland that put animals out of their homes by farmers who
take measures to kill wild animals that might try to feed off their
crops.

Why draw the line at animals as "kin"? Why not all life?
