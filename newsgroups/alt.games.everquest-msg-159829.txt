You might want a bit fuller group(another tank, another healer, maybe an
enchanter)but the level range should be ok..

Also bear in mind that if you or any of your group is of evil alignment,
they will lose faction with Venril Sathir by fighting here and will
eventually become KOS at the outpost in The Overthere.

Not necessarily such a big issue since the Plane of Knowledge is accessible
now, but I thought I'd mention it.
