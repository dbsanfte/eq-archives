    Clerics without access to a Manastone and a Faithstone solo worse than
BST, RNG, PAL, SK, MNK, WIZ, DRU, SHM, ENC, MAG, NEC, BRD with similar gear.
Wow, that doesn't look so hot, does it? If you equip them well enough, WAR
would also out-solo a cleric.

    See my comments above. At least a melee has gear options that allow them
to solo well. The only gear that can really make a cleric into a solo
machine is the aforementioned Manastone - and unlike the Truncheon and
Fungi, Manastones no longer drop (and have never dropped on some servers).

    The solo warriors and rogues I know are bandaging up a storm, and/or
using their rare drop Heart of Fungus with Chloroplast on it, and/or
clicking on their 100 point healing Kunark BPs. They aren't sitting on their
asses. The cleric, though, has no choice - without a second box, he has to
sit on his ass.

    Look at my list of classes that solo better. Look at the very short list
of classes that are worse - WAR, ROG. Note how with proper gear, those two
classes become better than the cleric at soloing. Discuss.
