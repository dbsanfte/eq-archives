Can any enchanter help me with this ?  I have been in plane of hate
now for 9 days straight, over 80 hours total killing every rev on
track and the named revs in tier 1 and have yet to see this drop.  I
can do the entire beastlord and druid epics combined in the time I
have wasted in hate waiting on this one drop.  I have read the
websites, most of which are old, referring to this matter.

Any further information on this drop ?  Does it drop further in more
frequently?  I have pulled all my hair out arrrrgh.
