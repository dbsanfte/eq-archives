1 wis is 10 mana at level 50. So at level 50 4 wis is better than 25
mana if you don't yet have 200 wis. At 200 wis plus each extra point
of wis is only one point of mana so then 25 mana is better than 4 wis.

It scales up to 50 sort of, so if low enough 25 mana would probably be
more mana than 4 wis would give you. I don't know the exact formula.

http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/manacalc/

that shows you the mana you'd get for wis at a particular level, which
should help you.
