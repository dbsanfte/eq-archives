A couple criteria that would make faster in-game transport more palatable
for me are:

1.  Shouldn't be available at level 1 - folks should have to find there
way around in the early levels.  It's part of the fun of learning the
game.  I spent huge amounts of time on my first characters exploring, and
those are some of my fondest memories of EQ.

2.  A single central hub that links almost all parts of the world in two
transitions destroys the sense of a world.  I really liked the horse routes
in DAoC - they were fast yet gave the impression of land traversed, they
cost a nominal sum, and they didn't break ingame fiction.
