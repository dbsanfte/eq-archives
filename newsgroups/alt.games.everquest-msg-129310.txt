Fire AE.  That's why you bring two high level mages along.  Two fire pets,
plus some heals to keep them going.  Stay out of AE range.  He is one of the
last steps in the Shaman epic, so you should expect him to be tough.  He is
also nonaggro to everyone, unless someone gives him the Tear from Fear (I
think that's the piece), or someone attacks him.
