I was lagging too badly to fight anything last night, so, after
getting a wisdom buff from an enchanter, I decided to go use up my
vegetables. (Wis buffs are wonderful, 7 of my 10 points came on the
first 40 combines. And I did over 100 combines, got 160 skill in
brewing now. My poor fingers don't want to see ginesh again)
While I was there, a level 13 warrior wanted me to port him to South
Ro for a CR - I offered buffage and sow but that wasn't good enough,
it seems. A low level mage was buzzing around the brew barrel,
wondering when I was done so he could make kiola for 'sowing', then he
asked if I could go to misty thicket and buy him a large 'sowing' kit.
He didn't have the time to run there himself and figured I could just
bind in freeport, port there and gate back...
