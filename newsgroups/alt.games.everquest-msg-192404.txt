If you are just going to play the same account on both PCs at
different times, then no, you dont have to buy another set of CDs.
Just install the CDs on the other system and patch it and you are set
to go. Any settings (macros, UI layouts etc) wont be installed but you
can copy them over from your other system if you wish.

But if you are wanting 2 seperate accounts, then yes, you have to buy
another set of CDs (and hence pay for 2 accounts monthly) and register
the second account.
