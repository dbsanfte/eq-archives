*snip*

I have a story to add to the port-beggars-from-hell collection.
This happened about a week ago. I was leisurely hunting cougars
in Iceclad, and in comes a tell from a 40ish monk...

Them: are there any clerics in the zone?
[/who]
Me: Nope, not unless they're anon
Them: well can u port me there then? I died by the bridge

[/who idiot... they're in freeportw]
[hmmm...they're three only friggin zones and one boat ride away]
[I'm feeling unusually generous]
Me: very well, go to wcommons druid ring and tell me when you get there

[time goes by]
Them: ok i'm there
[I finish off a cougar]
Me: gating now

[LOADING, PLEASE WAIT]
[look around ring, no one in sight]

Me: I'm at the ring, where are you?
Them: come to loc xxx,yyy
[wtf? I have to come to them?]
[turn on Track, idiot is in list. track them.]

[find our idiot under half health getting smacked around by a paladin]
[figure out that the paladin is a player. they're dueling.]
Them: port now I'm getting killed
Them: port now plz

[thinking this is amusing, invite idiot]
[sit down to mem circle of iceclad. idiot is running in circles.]
[cast spell. LOADING, PLEASE WAIT]

Them: you ported without me
Me: duh. you ran out of range. that's not my fault
Them: its ok I got my bro to port me

[go back to cougars shaking my head]
[a few minutes pass. idiot does show up in iceclad.]
Them: hey can I get a port to NK? I need to do a transfer
[silence]
Them: can I get a port to NK
[/ignore]
