  I agree... the difference is something like 1 AC and 3 dex?  I don't even
remember.  If I had found a forest loop at 29, I probably would have sold it
for something better, like a chipped bone bracer.  I eventually got one off
a mountain giant at level 40, and decided to keep it, but only because I'd
pretty much gotten all the good affordable gear for my character's other
slots.  And I kept using my other gold jasper ring and felt no compelling
urge to run out and buy a matching forest loop. :)
