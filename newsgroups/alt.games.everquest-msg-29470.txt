While Verant is often slow (or very slow) to fix game quirks that
cause players hardships, they're *very* aggressive about tracking
down and nailing any flaw in the game that allows any sort
of "exploit", especially item-duping or exp/skill fast-tracking.

Most of the times they yank the servers down on short notice
instead of waiting for a scheduled patch, it's to immediately
fix an exploit they just found.

As a result, exploits for EQ are *very* far and few between,
if there are even any at all at the moment.
