Lokari pointed me at the info I wanted from your earlier post.  I missed a
step or two in there I see.  On the Adapter tab, there is a Properties
button, pressing that will bring up yet another window, (I really should be
posting this from home where I can see what I am talking about), on that
window there is a tab that will display the driver information in a more
familiar format.  As I said however, Lokari pointed me at where the driver
information I wanted was in your earlier post.  Thanks.  You have a driver
that is apparently newer than the one I was using until very recently.  I
had 21.83, you have 21.85.
