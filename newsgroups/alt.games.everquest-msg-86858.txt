You cut out the part that explained it:

"The skill system in rolemaster, gurps, or even Daoc is far
closer to how things should work. You can get a 100% skill
in one thing or a 80% skill in 2 or a 70% skill in 3."

That assumption -- that a master in one field is, at best, a
journeyman in others -- is fairly common in games of this
type (magic/fantasy) as well as literature.  The other part
of that assumption is the obvious "jack of all trades, master
of none" type.

The real difference is at the high-end capabilities.  So you
don't get a pure 80-20 split.  Let's say that EQ was like
that:  you get five points per level.  Training Disc:defensive
is going to cost you 75 points.  Training that requires you
have mastered evade, riposte, etc, all at a cost of 5 points
per level (good, bad, average, etc).   You also have to be a
grandmaster (20 points per level) in a weapon skill.  And
so on and so on.

So you *can* get an "EQ" warrior.  But doing so means you
really didn't train in *anything* else.   Apply the same logic
to a cleric and you might get a warrior-priest who's a master
swordsman and a master healer.  He'll never get any Disc
or Complete Heal -- not enough points to go around.  Or you
*can* get a EQ cleric.   It's up to the player.
