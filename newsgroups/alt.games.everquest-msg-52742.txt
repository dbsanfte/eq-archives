    They supposedly keep logs of all transactions. Check the logs. A big
part of the problem is who CAN check logs. To clamp down on corruption, the
head GM is the one who reviews logs. But that means any situation that
requires that action to be resolved has to be routed through ONE person who
can have very erratic hours. Petitions also seem to drop off the queue if
you log for the night and someone tries to investigate it, instead of being
sent to a "backlog" queue to be answered when time permits. So a trade
petition has to be answered with some urgency, but cannot be. I don't know
how EQ could resolve the conflict between ability to ensure a corrupt
guide/GM cannot imbalance gameplay, and ensuring they have enough power to
resolve problems in a timely manner, but right now it isn't working well.

    As a quick example of corruption - a buddy's entire guild on The Rathe
went LD when on a Juggs raid they spotted Tolapmuj and pulled him. When they
got back, nobody else in zone had gone LD and a GM was there /cheering at
one of the "big three" guilds which had JUST come and bagged him. Hmm.

    This is the other point that burns people, even though it's true. Yes,
it's a lot of time - but it's time spent on what is a legitimate complaint.
If I have a real complaint, I don't want to hear that they're blowing me off
because someone thinks they should never die or get a full XP res after
going LD. I *know* they don't know who is legit and who is scamming based on
the petition, but I don't care. If I have a legitimate complaint, I have
every expectation that it should be addressed.

    It sends a message about the game itself or about the customer service
setup if there's so many petitions that customer service can't address them
all. Can also imply something about the players, but as players we tend to
overlook that part. 8)
