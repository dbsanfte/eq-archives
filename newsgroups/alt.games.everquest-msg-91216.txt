It's highly situational. Celestial fists make you attack insanely fast. 
I tried it against a damage shielded mob and barely had the time to turn 
attack off before I killed myself. Fast attacks also draw a LOT of hate. 
If you don't mind tanking, go right for it

Depending on the weapon. It's a safe bet to say that a weapon will slow 
you down

You get a per-level increased bonus to your main hand's damage. So the 
faster your main hand is, the more often that bonus is applied. This 
bonus doesn't work for the off hand, so if you find a weapon with better 
straight ratio than a fist, it makes sense to use it in off hand
