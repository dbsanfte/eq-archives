Yeah, you're welcome to feel how ever you want to feel, but it boggles my
mind that you came away from reading that article as a customer put-down.
It was an ASSHOLE customer put-down.  Assholes who think it's perfectly ok
to farm a non-xp item for 15 hours simply because they pay $10/mo while
OTHER people paying $10/mo CANNOT EARN the item with asshole farmers around,
and are forced to BUY it from them.  Assholes with no manners.  Assholes who
think that because they pay $10/mo they can act how ever they want.

The link isn't working for me at the moment (I think it's a local problem)
but I challenge you to find where she's insulting good customers.
