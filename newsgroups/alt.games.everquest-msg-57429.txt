Hi all

Today my TestEverquested started dowhloading Luclin files. It look like a
huge amount of files. Every all .s3d files and some new <zonename>2.s3d as
well.

It complained it was unable to patch a file named qeynos2.s3d because I
didn't had this file before. So I created one by copying the qeynos.s3d and
renaming it qeynos2.s3d then it managed to download the new version over it.
(very strange)

The patch screen has patched itself and now show a skinned full coloured
Shadow Of Luclin titled one.

It was a long time since I havn't tryed the test server. Is this a normal
behavoiour or a wiered thing.

Btw it look quite cool. I just have to wait the 4 hours download predicted
time it show and ill tell news after that. (Maybe I'll see some new SOL
characters or go to Luclin itself who know ?!
