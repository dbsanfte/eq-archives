I wouldn't be surprised, though, if death is more common at those points,
for two reasons.

1. Close to leveling might lead to carelessness.  Some people get excitied
close to leveling.  Others stay on when they are tired if they are near
leveling.  Both of these could increase one's chances of screwing up.

2. After leveling, some classes will have new spells or abilities, which
might lead to a change in tacticts.  There may be a change to new and
unfamiliar hunting grounds.  Plenty of extra opportunity to get killed.
(I bet Druid and Wizard deaths show a spike right after each new AOE spell
that can be used for quadding, for example).

Hmmm...I bet there is also a spike in certain classes deaths after certain
other classes level.  E.g., I would not be surprised to find that right
after Clerics hit 39, there is a spike in Warrior deaths due to CH.
