Well you say that Cq claims they didn't agro him nor even realize they
had agroed him as though you take their word for it.  That involves
trust, trust I don't seem to have in them to tell the truth.  I too have
a great interest in how this plays out.  Just as those who feel that Cq
is being mistreated say that they will temper their decision to continue
to be VI customers based on how VI deals with the issue, I too have to
make my decision to continue playing on that same basis.  If I think
they are willing to give up on the ideals of fair play and a sense of
game spirit simply to appease folks who complain when caught I have to
question if its worth playing the game any more.  Their long-standing
efforts to prevent the game from being reduced to who is the best
cheater have kept me as a customer so far, but when they stop putting
those concepts at the top of their list then a downward spiral into
chaos can be expected to follow, along with my return to single player
and LAN games till someone else comes along with an online game that
does not cater to the lowest common denominator or the almighty dollar.
