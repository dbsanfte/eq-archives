OK, but in GoD and OOW zones I've often been grouped with a chanter so 
it was a non-issue. And when I wasn't there was usually a chanter in 
zone you could hit up for some help. In the same way when playing in wos 
I've been happy to rez and buff groups that wiped, or at least their 
cleric to get them up and running again. So I just have not run into 
that. And hopefully by the time you can be playing in these zones you 
have some mind candy of your own, you may have a Beastlord or a Druid 
for some and hopefully you also have some decent FT gear so you are not 
so dependent on KEI as it is not the only way to get by, even if it is 
nice to have.
