I played about 20plat (I think) for a velium long sword, but it doesn't
actually allow me to use its special power until it's no use anymore. What
is the cheapest magical weapon you are likely to find other players selling?
Ignoring summoned weapons, which are NORENT.

I also had all kinds of problems getting a magic shield for bashing, so same
question.
