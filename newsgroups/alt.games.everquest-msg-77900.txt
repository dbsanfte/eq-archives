I'm not going repost everything you have already written and I'll get around
to reading the rest of the replies later, but I must say thank-you Toytown
for making my Everquest experience SOOOO much better.  I have a AMD K6-2 450
w/ 448mb ram, RIVA TNT2 32mb.  Ever since the Luclin release it has been a
complete and total slide show in pretty much any town (especially my hown
town of Rivervale).  I encourage anyone having problems to do this.  Some
results of the change are as follows.  All are with texture caching too.

Old zoning time:  between 1- 2 minutes, +3 in LOIO for some reason
New zoning time:  21 secs,  haven't tried LOIO

Old FPS in Freeport: 2-3fps (or there abouts) except when looking at a wall
then I'd get like 10 fps
New FPS in Freeport: gotta be at least 30

These are all at least 50% faster than pre-Luclin too.

This is freaking unbelievable to me.   I thought I was going to have to go
out and buy a whole new computer sooner than expected but this should keep
me going until at least 2003.  EQ is pretty much the only game I play these
days so if it works I'm happy.  I bought Luclin in December and tried it out
but there was no way my rig was even going to get close to being able to run
that.  So I uninstalled and started from scratch.  Going to install Luclin
again tonight though and give it a try.  I thank you again for that and if
you have any more suggestions I'm all ears.

ps.  Should you happen to play on Terris-Thule you now have free sows, ports
(once I get to 29) and anything else you ever need.
