It may not be inability to learn, but lack of desire.  Some folks find
the risk of being PKd to be an added excitement, others find it an
annoying distraction from what they're really playing for - regardless
of whether or not it succeeds.

I'd like to say such people should play different servers, but Bartle
disagrees to some extent; the latter attract the PKs that excite the
former, while the former frustrate the PKs by not being good targets.
