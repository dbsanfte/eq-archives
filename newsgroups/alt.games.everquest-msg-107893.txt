Well halfling warrior or rogue level the fastest based on the xp
bonuses (racial plus 5 percent bonus and the warrior or rogue bonuses)
That is just as far as xp, such as when grouping. From what I've seen
a class like a druid is going to level the fastest starting from level
one since it does well alone as well as in a group, no matter what
race it is (the halfling 5 percent bonus is the only diff for druids.)
The monk is going to be depending on a regen item like a fungi or
bandaging/mending if alone and humans are just the baseline as far as
xp with lots of other races.
