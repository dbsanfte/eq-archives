Make sure that the Luclin files loaded in the right location (eg your
EQ directory). Some have reported that the default load location is
C:\Program Files\Sony\Everquest, when it should really be C:\Program
Files\EverQuest.

The fact that you were able to log in long enough to port indicates
that SoL works on your machine to some degree. You can't load a zone
file if it isn't there (or in the wrong folder).
