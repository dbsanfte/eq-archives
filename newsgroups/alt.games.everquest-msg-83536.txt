It agree as well, I don't think it should be required to purchase a whole
new game set.  In ultima online for example, I emailed the boys at UO and
said my wife would like to play as well, they emailed me back a new account
code to use when I installed the software (from my initial purchase) on the
second box.  I just had to pay the additional monthly fee, I thought that
was more than fair.
