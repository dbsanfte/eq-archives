OMG. newbies DO this?

I recall when I was a newb (and sometimes I -still- feel like one, every
time I log in ;) )... I did have good teachers and they did make sure I knew
that I wasn't god, but I guess, looking back on it, that I *still* did
stupid shit. Hell, I do stupid shit *now*, almost 3 years later! LOL...
Still target MOB to cast snare and have -myself- targeted without realizing
it... Oh yeah, that one is sooo much fun... can't run worth a damn, cancels
SoW... oh, and there's the part where I cast healing on a mob instead of
myself... ok, that one isn't -quite- as bad. sheesh. Sometimes I wonder if I
shoulda gotten up that day ;) Nice of you to try to enlighten them
beforehand, however :) I had a boyfriend who did this as a matter of rote,
with me, but out there in the big, bad world, you can't always count on
someone who doesn't even know you to care enough to give a shit. /em cheers
Phillippe!
