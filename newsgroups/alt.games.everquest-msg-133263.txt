| No shit dickhead. Australia does not have freedom of speech. But saying

No, that is precisely what it means, that you are a lesser country of very
small people, seeing that you have not had the guts to get into your
government's face and fight for your rights as free men.

Of course, Uncle Sam these days is hardly the poster boy for free speech
either now that the press is showing itself to be such a pushover for the
Bush government's suppression of information like those Bin Laden tapes,
press access to Camp X-Ray.  There comes a point where you have to weigh the
value of "security" against the price of liberty in a nation born with words
ringing to the tune of "Give me liberty or give me death":  it seems the
words of our anthem, "land of the free, home of the brave" mean nothing to
this people anymore.  I look at these peons riding around all trussed up in
their seatbelts to go goose-stepping to and fro in their Smoke-Free fascist
environment -- look at them all fitted out in a designer Sam Brown belt by
General Motors: only thing missing is a little Charlie Chaplin mustache on
every face and "Homeland Uber Alles" on the car radio to make the picture
complete.

"It takes a long evolutionary process to arrive at objectivity, that is, to
acquire the faculty to see the world, nature, and other persons and oneself
as they are, and not distorted by desires and fears. The more man develops
this objectivity, the more he is in touch with reality, the more he matures,
the better can he be to create a human world in which he is at home." --
Erich Fromm in *The Sane Society*

"And it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing."  -- Irving Mills,
Duke Ellington.
