I am a new player in EQ also.  I found most of the players are very
nice to low level characters.  I would be out there fighting for my
life and ran to the guard often, then out from the blue, someone will
give me something to help my cleric.  The funny thing is after someone
gave me something, someone else will start asking me for stuff.  I
mean, asking a level 4 cleric for stuff?
