I've been wondering about trying to get his WIS bracelet for myself.  But I
don't want to give up my Supple wrist thingy that gives me Extended Range
III, and my other wrist is an SS bracer with the all-important Summon Food
effect.

Still, I do need some WIS stuff... I've been trading out WIS items for MANA
items lately, and it's beginning to take its toll... there was a point
where, with KEI, I only had 254 WIS.  I got that back up to 255 with the
Raptorhide helm, but I'd sure like to have a greater margin of safety.

Heh, listen to me, always assuming I'll have KEI.  =)

Hehehehe... I wish I could see if I could be cool under such pressure -
it'll likely be at least a year, if ever, before I see Vex Thal.  Our
resident uber guild *just* got into Vex Thal, and I find them extremely
annoying, so I'll likely never join them.

There's something to be said for making the journey yourself rather than
skipping ahead to the end content.  I can't tell you how satisfying it was
for our guild to do HoT, and do it right after a couple of false starts.
And then one of our druids needed to kill Fay, and we mobilized and managed
that with hardly a death - a far cry from our first attempt, when it took us
two tries and many deaths before we killed Fay.  I know all these things are
yawners to many uber guilds, but it feels *good* to do this stuff on your
own without having it handed to you.

Hehehe... I wondered if someone would have that reaction.

It's been interesting following this debate on EQ Clerics - count to four or
/pause 40?  I read the arguments for both and found both sides had equally
valid concerns.  So my mind at this point is open.  When it came time to
participate in my first CH chain, I decided to go with what the others were
doing.  Since it soon became apparent by their chatter that they were doing
the /pause thing, so I went with that.

I have to admit, my biggest concern was that I would double-fizzle -
something I do very rarely, but would have deadly consequences if it were to
happen during a CH chain.  And with the /pause 40, I'd be stuck without a
recourse.  Still, I could also see myself getting too fast, with the
adrenaline of the battle making me count to four too quickly.

Next time I'll try it with just counting out loud and seeing how that works.
Like I said, I still have an open mind and am willing to try it both ways
until I decide which works best.

That was the conclusion I came to upon further reflection.  I know how
annoyed I get when my tanks forget to turn off attack during enrage; I've
seen how fast their health can fall.  So I figured, just as you described,
that the CH chain is set up to deal with a worst-case scenario.

Hehehe, well, my own inexperience had a part to play in this too.  All I
needed was to set up two hotkeys in advance.

Maybe.  I could definitely find a use for it in camps like the Sewers in CT,
where there are no casting mobs, so the resists don't hurt.  I remember when
I got my FT3 boots and my FT1 earring and what a difference they made.  I'd
sure like to stack FT2 on top of that.  (And Mental Clarity once I get MGB
and other important AA stuff.)

Aye.  Afterwards the guild was congratulating themselves for doing this with
only three clerics.  No one congratulated me for helping them out, but
that's okay, I was thankful for the experience.  :)

Heh, didn't think about it.  But surely one of the other clerics did, which
is why they chose four.

Ah.  That would be very useful.

I'm actually embarrassed that I didn't think of that - obvious, really.
Another one of those things that plain old experience teaches you, which is
why I was glad to learn how to do a CH chain with an experienced guild.

Yeah, red-faced that I didn't think of that at the time.  Mighta been able
to kill Gozz the first time if I'd done that.

Ooh, good idea.

This particular raid was short on healers all around.  I did have someone in
my group to heal me, they were just dead.

Hehehe.  That's why I'm so thankful for my Extended Range III wrist.

No one in that guild said a bad word to me about the CH chain, for which I'm
somewhat grateful.  I was able to somewhat objectively judge my own
shortcomings, with an eye towards doing better next time (hopefully).

Aye, I've heard it referred to that as well, too.  It's tough - the monk in
our group is an insane puller, and was intent on having us clear the
placeholders from all four corners.  We managed it, but it was rough.

> Good show, Monual!!!

Thanks.  I very much appreciate the insights of an experienced uber player
on what I went through.
