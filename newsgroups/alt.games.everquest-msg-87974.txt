Hi, I used to be a frequent reader and occasional posted here. 

Ever since Luclin went live, I have been unable to play EQ. The first time I tried to login after 
that day's patch, I received a message that said "No 3D device found".

I have a Compaq Presrario 5190, which has an integrated AGP ATI Rage LT Pro. The most recent
driver update on Compaq's site didn't fix the problem. I downloaded the most recent driver from ATI, 
and that got me in, but the only thing that appears correctly are objects within the charcter's view region
of the screen all the interface and text portions of the game show up as jumbled colors.

I cannot afford to buy anew video card, which I would have to have the store install for me because I'm
clueless as to hwo to get around the AGP problem. Besides, I would rather buy a new PC which would be
easier to upgrade.

Does anyone else here have this setup and was able to get around this problem without buying new
hardware? I greatly appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks
