HAHAHAHA.....

You KNEW it was my sis... GOOD perception Avenger. :) PLEASE don't say
anything in the FA NG... she still lurks there on occasion and I am hoping
to surprise her.  ;)

I will probably observe her playing on occasion but I have a few things
going IRL that are limiting my 'play' time. I barely sysop for a few hours
each week, I get to fly about twice a week, so I have to be kind of stingy
with my recreation. :( I am sure she will try to lure me to play, though..
lol. She used to BEG me to play D&D with her.
