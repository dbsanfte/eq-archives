The hoppers and the Sambatas share the cave. In the back right 
cavern is the PH for either the Ancient Rockhopper (or Age Old, 
not really sure as I avoid that cave when hoppers are up) that 
you kill to bring on the sambatas or Chief Leader Garn (his PH is 
the Sambata Tribal Keeper) to bring on the Hoppers. 

To answer your question directly, the only other place to hunt 
hoppers for those pelts is in Mons Letalis but its almost too 
risky as the hoppers are higher level (and I don't think have a 
better chance of dropping the better pelts), are not in a 
particular area but roam around, and you have to watch out for 
the often roaming stonegrabbers who like to scowl at everyone. 

Hope this helps
