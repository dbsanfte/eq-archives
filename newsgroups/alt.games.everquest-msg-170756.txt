And my point is... what would you have said if somebody popped up in those
days and said "SoW and Clarity are ruining the game!  They're making stuff
way too easy and ruining everyone's playing skills!"?

Because in those days SoW and Clarity *were* awesome... these days they're
incredibly commonplace, if you can't cast it or find someone to cast it you
can just buy potions, and with AA points you can train Run3 and you won't
even need it.  And Clarity is worthless with KEI around.  But back then they
were great, right?  I mean, people wanted them about as bad as people want
KEI now.  Right?  Or am I just a youngun who doesn't know anything?  Even if
I am though, KEI's being more in demand than SoW and Clarity ever were
wouldn't negate my point... KEI is not a free ticket to uberness, it's just
one of the best things around now.  Eventually something will replace even
KEI.

Yeah, and my great-grandfather walked 5 miles to school every day so let's
all do that too or our walking skills will suck.

Anyway... point is, EQ is a constantly changing game.  Things pretty much
*have* to get bigger and better and more powerful constantly or everyone
will get bored with the game.  It's just a matter of developing new
skillsets to move with the times.  KEI doesn't mean you don't need skill to
play anymore, it just means that some skills are not as important now as
others... like for example, with KEI you can focus less on conserving
mana -- though I find I still need to conserve my mana, just not as much --
and more on knowing which spells to cast when, how to avoid getting aggro,
etc., etc.
