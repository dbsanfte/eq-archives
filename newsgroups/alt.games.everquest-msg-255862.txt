Did you buy the other expansions yet?  If so, head to Plain of
Knowledge.

If not, check http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Paladin
Looks like Cease is a SoL expansion spell only sold in ShadowHaven.

You'll get Calm at lvl 49... !
However, at 15 you get Lull and that looks to be at all the guild
halls.
