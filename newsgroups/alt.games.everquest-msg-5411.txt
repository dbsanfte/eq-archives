You can do it with one command or macro but I prefer to have separate
ones.  When puller returns to my shaman's group I just hit 9,8,7,6.   9=
/assist, so I am targeting what puller has targeted, 8=/pet attack so my
pet is now on that target, 7=/stand so I'm ready for 6=slow spell. 
Keeping them all together and in order really helps on those all day
camps so you can fight w/o too much effort leaving more time for giving
your party members a hard time for being too tall or too short.  Since
there are times I want to send pet w/o assisting I don't like to have it
all on one key, but you could just macro /assist on one line and /pet
attack on next and do it with one key if you prefer.
