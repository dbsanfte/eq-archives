I suppose, in retrospect, I could see how anone could view him that way.
There might even be some whole undiscovered storyline about how he's so
lonely, the last of his kind, wondering if his long lost mate will ever
return so they can save their species....

But at the time all I really managed to notice was him jauntily
sauntering over and quickly stomping me into a bloodstain on the sand.
Between the cleric nearly chain casting celestials mixed in with CHeals,
and the rogue backstabbing like mad, we still managed to only get him
down to about half of his HP before Tiru was OOM and they had to bag it
out of there while I "took two for the team". Orlun even managed to fear
him a couple times, but it wasn't enough. He just hits for too much and
has too damn many HPs.
