feet he was a liability to the expedition. Without
him, they could travel faster and there would be
more food for the others. He made up his mind. 

It was March 17th 1912, his 32nd birthday. Most
people receive gifts on their birthdays; he was
going to give his companions the only thing he had
to give - his life.

outside, and may be some time.""
