You sigh, write the guy's name down, and make a point of never grouping
or helping the guy again, if you don't believe it was an honest mistake.

no

unless this occured on Sullon Zek, no.

let it go, there's nothing you can do about this particular incident
now. The only ways to prevent something like this from happening again
are to: 1) make sure everyone knows that there's a 1 in 1000000000
chance a NO DROP earring of station might drop, and no one should loot
it if found until it's randomed by the meleers in the party; 2) group
with friends whom you trust.
