I just recently started playing myself with a view to getting an idea of the
game before EQ2 is released and I am very impressed (although I havent
played any other online games to compare with). Almost everyone I have met
has been friendly and helpful and the game is entertaining enough to have
keep my spare time occupied. I personally would recommend it. If you go
ahead you probably will be better using the Venril Sathir server which is
commonly used by UK players rather than the newbie servers.

From what Ive seen the game can suit just about any level of player. If you
want to play casual and have some fun meetiong people and exploring/questing
you can. Equally if u want to put in alot of time you can become an endgame
uber player. Enjoy.
