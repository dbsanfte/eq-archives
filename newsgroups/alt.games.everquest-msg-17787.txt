The only clue you get (apart from other players in their "grats!" shouts) is
that when sat down early on during L35 without the book for whatever reason,
your Meditate skill goes up. It's a lot less exciting than you'd think,
though, and adds little to the joy of sitting motionless.

Could be worse, could be a new skill you'd have to train in:
"You have learned the basics of Meditating Without Books."
