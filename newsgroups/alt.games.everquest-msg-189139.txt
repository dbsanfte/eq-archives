Not going to say that just because you've played a few characters into 
their 50s it automatically means you know how to play every class well.  
Nope, not going to say it.

The gripe is only partly about damage output.  In the high end game, 
enchanters shouldn't be outdamaging the best damage dealers in the game 
(rangers, baby!), and especially not outdamaging entire groups while 
soloing.  It's more about risk vs. reward.  The fact that an enchanter can 
take a hasted pet and solo through tier2 planes faster than an entire group 
can makes them overpowered.

Not that I *want* to see them nerfed any time soon.  I love playing my 
enchanter.  I hope to get him into those planes someday soon.  It's just 
hard to deny that they really do deserve it :P
