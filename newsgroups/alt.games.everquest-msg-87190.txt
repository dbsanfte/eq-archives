NPC is hardly affected. The spells that lower ac have some effect but the
only real spells that disable NPCs are Slows, snares and mana drains

Althouh when I used to solo watchman Halv I cast Str debuff, Cripple
(ac,str,agi debuff) then cast the suffocating dot (str,ac debuff)

This caused him to have zero str and become encumbered so would move at
snare speed so i could fear kite him easily )
