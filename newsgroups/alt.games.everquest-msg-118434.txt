My fatherly advice to you, and it's got nothing to do with EULA's (I am one
of the one of the "ethicly challenged"), is to cut the modem cable in two
until you learn how to supervise your "child"..

Nothing of what has happened here is even unusual for a newsgroup - or what
happens on the Internet for that matter. The relative anonmity of the
internet means people act like jackasses all the time, as you've found out
in more ways than one.

That's not even the *real* problem though - the relative anonmity also
attracts some very unsavoury types to different net forums, the sort of
unsavoury types that *look* for children for all sorts of sick reasons.
Bizbee's post, brutal as it was is right on the mark.

Maybe it's time you starting Minding Your Own Business, it seems to be
something you have been neglecting till now, Ummmkay? It isn't anyones elses
right or responsibility to do it for you.

Sincerly, Rastus
