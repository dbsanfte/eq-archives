International Trolling Association
Paris, France


        The new Trolling Point System for Trolls has been approved by the
Central Troll Committee for Troll Standards and Procedures.  The new TROLL
POINT SYSTEM (TPS) will take effect on September 1, 1999.


        10 points Killfile:  Being Killfiled is the highest honor and the
most points a Troll can achieve.  It represents complete victory and
indicates that the Troll has performed on a MASTER TROLL level.

        9 points: Complaint to Trolls ISP:  While not as good as being
killfiled, a complaint to a Trolls ISP indicates that once again the TROLL
has struck hard and deep.

         8 points: Death Threat:  Another indication of a Master Troll at
Work.  The death threat is firm proof that the Troll has cut to the bone
and left his victim (the fish) floundering and gasping for air.

        7 points: Personal Verbal Attack:  A personal verbal attack on a
Troll in response to a trolling post indicates that the Troll has riled
and disturbed the fish in question.

        6 points: Plea to Ignore Troll:  A Plea from a Forum Group member
to other group regulars to ignore the Troll in question is a sure sign
that the Troll is doing his/her sport with proficiency.

        5 points: Killfile response:  When a poster who has claimed to
have KILLFILED a particular Troll, then responds to another Post by the
Troll in question, rates a solid 5 points for the Trolls ability to snag a
hypocritical fish.

        4 points: Logical response:  A person who responds to a Troll
trying to use logic and reason to rebut a Troll is worth 4 points for such
stupidity as to think a Troll cares about what they have to say.

        3 points: 10+ individual responses:  When a post by a Troll gets
at least 10 responses from 10 different individuals.

        2 points: Positive response: If a Troll gets a positive response
such as ROFLOL: LOL: Great Post, etc.

        1 point: Any type of response at all.
