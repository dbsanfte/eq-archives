Actually, yes, I did have the answer to this just as soon as I'd made my
post. This annoying little pop-up really is a pain in the .. I'd totally
forgotten about it, but as I'd bought a new PC yesterday, got it home, set
up and installed EverQuest I was in *so* much of a hurry to see how the game
ran. Of course, ten minutes into my session my screen flickered and from
memory I knew what had happened. The problem is, when this *service*
activates itself, I'm totally *unable* to close down out of EverQuest. No
matter what I do, I'm stuck and am forced to turn the PC off by pressing the
power button on my PC - I hate having to do this. Good ridance to bad
rubbish as we say in the UK.

Cyrakis: Many, many thanks for the pointer regarding enabling the Firewall
within Windows XP - I never knew how to switch it on - I do now though - so
thanks again.

I do have one more problem though, I should ask in a new thread, but since
this has gotten a few replies I'll try here. Windows XP isn't remembering my
passwords - this can be a good thing - but also it's tiresome having to type
passwords each and every time I need to check Email and the like. Is there a
walk-through that will tell me how to *force* Windows XP to remember
passwords?

Kind regards,

Stevie.
