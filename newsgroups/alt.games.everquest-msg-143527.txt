You got a bad group....your thoughts on roles appear to be accurate.  In
that situation the warrior is supposed to take and hold aggro from the mob..
you are supposed to move behind the mob and use backstab to inflict damage
and the cleric should have been healing and buffing as needed.  Under no
circumstances in a group that has pulled multiple mobs should someone be
looting while on of the monsters is still alive and inflicting damage.  As a
rogue you  should continue to group because you will have to group as you
get higher in level.
