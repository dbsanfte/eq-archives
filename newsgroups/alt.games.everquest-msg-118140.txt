I'm not quite sure that's what's being done here.  If the account were being
dupicated, then there would be something to go on.  As it is, a person can
do anything they want with a legally purchased copy of copyrighted material,
including transfer it to another individual (with the exception of
duplicating and distributing the material).  Trust me, I've been through
this enough with the fansub ethics threads on rec.arts.anime.misc  It's only
the EULA that even allows Verant to not honor "violated" accounts in the
first place.

As far as transferring in-game items, including accounts themselves, that
doesn't violate a copyright law.
