Starting at level 50, he is been fairly weird to my Paladin.
Sometimes, he will attck me on sight. Other times I can walk up and
hail him, then he says "I should kill you for speaking to me  or some
such". In either case the pally can do him easy now. But my level 50
wizard friend has a little trouble with him occasionally. The wizard
has more trouble with the Dragoon, the MR of these guys is tough on
pure casters. Back to Gix, I whack him every time I get the chance,
just for old time sake. I remember him killing me when he was green a
few times, thats an undercon. - Ken
