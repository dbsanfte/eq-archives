Well, to be fair here, an ogre SK with 0 bonus points in STA(127) has a
higher STA than a DE warrior with 30 bonus points in STA(105).  Note, an
Ogre SK only gets 20 bonus points, and a DE warrior only gets 25 bonus
points.  Please understand, I am not agreeing with the idiot who started
this thread, just pointing out that Ogre's inherintly have a much better
STA.  Of course, an Ogre Shaman has a higher STA than a DE warrior too.
It's the same starting value as an Ogre SK.  Heck, a Halfling Druid can have
a higher STA than a DE warrior, base is 85 with 30 bonus points to spread
around, vs the DE warrior base of 75 with 25 bonus points.  A Human Magician
can have a higher STA too.  OK, enough playing with the race vs class tables
now.
