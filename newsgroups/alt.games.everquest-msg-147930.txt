People are rarely singular entities. Killing one person will normally at
least "annoy" quite a few others who had various famial/cultural/religous
connections to that one person. Over time, this policy multiples your
enemies, not remove them.

All of them? Short of sending the entire planet back to the stone age
including yourselves that will be a tad difficult. Remember your own
backyard isn't the cleanest in the world when it comes to extremist
nutcases.

But this policy would make the US the monster that people only fear the
possibility of now. Don't think you could stop at the Arabs afterwards.

And that can be used against you as well - that is terrorism is all about.

Then I fail to see why any Country on earth should be concerned acts like
Sept 11. If the US put's itself in the same league as the terrorists, what
concern of it of ours if you killing each other? As you say yourself - sell
them both bullets

If the Mideast was hypothetically-vacated the rest of the world would
already see itself against the wall. Whose next?

People who are willing to die without pause are the most cost effective
tools used by those "powers/forces" and it is hatred which breeds them.
Breed hatred and you make it easier for them to strike you - and cheaper.
Removing that hatred takes generations of tolerance and restraint.

Wouldn't it just be easier for the entire planet to rid itself of these
hypothetical genocidal yanks rather than let them get rid of everyone else
in turn?

But your <always> paying the Danegeld, that is precisely what has brought
you have the Danes. Just about every bitter enemy you have are the former
regimes you have supported and their enemies. US Danegelding is the core of
the hatred.

BTW - you already have a history of capitulation to terrorists, ie Mideast
arms for hostages farce.

Then why should we care if a couple of million of you guys are wiped out in
a biological attack tommorow? As you have said before, sell them both
bullets...

A gamble, not a given.

Don't be to sure that list has been completed yet, there may be more out

Good point. Just remember it applies to you as well as everyone else : )
