Well.  Here is one of the reasons I love purusing this newsgroup. 
Lurker though I may be.  We hear about such interesting things, even
if off-topic.

I looked at Mary's site.  Sad.  Sad.  Please take a look to see an
example of a truly obsessive-compulsive personality.  Can you imagine
all the WORK that went into the site's creation??  IMHO, it is
authentic and not a joke; it is too closely, tightly, cohesively
constructed to be a fake.  It sounds like a true borderline psychotic.
 If I were her, I might actually FEAR the man that responds to her.

In order for her to even consider reading your email you must read
through her "Required Reading" and take note of certain 'signal
words'.  Then the twelve words must be arranged in a particular order
to form a subject line.  I'm a bit compulsive myself and I like
puzzles.  So I went through the articles to find these words.

I did not read them all.  I simply copied them to Word and then
searched for italic words.  She's clever; each phrase is different
making searching for exact words inefficient.  However, perhaps she
didn't know that one can search for formatting.

Check out the phrases:
Here's a small word I want you to include in your e-mail: I.
A term to assign to your personal introduction to me is want.
The signal word from this article is to.  
A vocable to insert in your electronic mail is try.
Provide the element of speech to when you write to me.
Put this expression in the note that you send me...learn.
Submit the piece of vocabulary to in that special e-message.
Lay the lexical particle please in your composition.
Please place the tag you in your written communication.
A mark I need you to incorporate into your introductory announcement
is on.
An expletive to inject in the letter I request is your.
Position the idiom terms in your writing to me.

Thus, the complete, special subject line must be: "I want to try to
learn to please you on your terms."

I intend on e-mailing her and suggesting she seek psychiatric help. 
Why *you* choose to email her is your own affair.

Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Isn't it evil to suggest we spam her?  Maybe. 
Or maybe a nice spamming might awaken her a little.  Who knows.  Hey,
maybe a good 'spamming' is what she really needs!  ;)

Maybe someone in the group will *want* to be her submissive
quasi-slave.  Oh, BTW if you enjoy masturbation, you'll have to give
that up.  I quote:

"I'd prefer that a man who masturbates be happily able to give it up
for me without a chastity device. But, if a man who's interested in me
wouldn't otherwise be able to not masturbate, I'd be willing to have
him be in a chastity tube, and I'd hold the key for him. This is an
option to which I wouldn't have been open in the past, and I mention
it now only because it seems unlikely that I'll find a man who isn't
addicted to masturbation. Here's a web address for a reasonably
priced, very adequate chastity tube: http://chastytube.com (notice
that chastity is misspelled in the web address). I have no association
with this company, but a friend of mine wears this device and is very
happy with it."

She has one guy, My Only Suitor, My Slave-in-training, who she claims
is wearing the above device.  He lives out of state from her, the only
have phone conversations, but yet...she holds the KEY to this device!!
 Agh!

Good luck, have fun.

The special email subject line again is: I want to try to learn to
please you on your terms

Now, one of her daughters is very cute.  If she's not whacko like the
Mom, then I'd consider dating her.
