    So, not useful to you.  Apparently, though, they were
useful to him.  You dropped it, he wanted it, he picked
it up.  Still not seeing the stupidity.
    You want to decorate with something that can't be
picked up?  Grab a friend or hire one, take a low
level alt you don't care about or create one, and
have a series of duels that leave a bunch of bodies
around in interesting patterns.
   Lasts longer, and looks more impressive.
