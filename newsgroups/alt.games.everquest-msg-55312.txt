That's NOT a title.  Hell, I don't know french and I even I know
that's not a title.  It is a very, very common French naming
convention, and no more a title that Stoutheart or Lorespinner.  The
GM who refused to allow it was an ignorant prick, who doesn't
understand the naming convention.
I rarely disagree with Tiru (she'll alwasy be Georg to me) but in this
case I don't see where she sees that a three word phrase is in and of
itself prohibited.  The only reference to that is rule 11, which I am
including here:

11.  Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two
or more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob,
Diediedie and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in
first names and are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger,
Giantslayer). Descriptive compound words (each separate part of the
word and the entire word) must otherwise adhere to all other naming
rules.

Rule 11 prohibits phrases that do NOT form descriptive compound words.
Couerd'Aigle is a descriptive compound word.  Compound words are
encouraged in surnames.

The only other possible issue is the use of d', which is obviously not
being used as a substitute for The or as an honorific/title.  

By your very own logic if I say that you have sex with 6 year olds,
and you don't come back and dispute that, even if you never see this
message, you are obviously a pedophile who should be locked up for the
rest of your days.  
Again, descriptive compound words are GOOD and even ENCOURAGED by
Verant.  They are very much part of what Verant wants for the game.  I
would repetition this, and send an email to customer support at sony
with your logs attached.  It has become quite evident by the posting
of senior Verant employees, the postings at slownewsday.net, the
discussions on various forums, and my own personal observations in
dealing with GMs/Guides that Verant is aware that they have some
issues with customer service, and that they are really looking at the
disconnect between guides/GMs, server GMs, and senior CS management.
They WANT to know where the problems lie.  They want to fix the
problems.  Please politely explain where you feel CS fell down, but
don't let that stop you from re-petitioning.  It may also help to have
a copy of the NEW naming policy printed out, in case you get that same
GM.  If you do get that GM, ask him exactly which rule this violates,
mention that you are currently looking at the policy, and be prepared
to explain that french compound words have a slightly different format
than english compound words.  Oh, and above all, continue to be
polite.  Keeping your sense of humor seems to help too.
