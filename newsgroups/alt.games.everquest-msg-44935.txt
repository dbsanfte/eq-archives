For the past week I've had some major lag issues on the Vazaelle server.
Even last night I had about 6 linkdeaths after which I gave up playing for
the night. Some inquiring revealed that everyone in at least the same zone
(Dreadlands) and several guildies in other zones were experiencing the same
problems.

After asking around in OOC I got a few persons claiming a lot of the
Uberguilds ported their lvl 50+ chars to the Vazaelle server from the older
ones and that we're now about the most over-populated server of the lot
(with /who count not working anymore I can't get an estimate).

I personally hope the lag is a problem still caused by the NYC disaster, but
can anyone confirm anything about high levels coming to the youngest
non-split server?
