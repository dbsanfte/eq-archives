Some work some don't.  Was in Butcherblock the other day.  Saw the boat to
FP dock.  The shuttles looked like they weren't in the correct positions but
they worked to get me to Kunark.  Best advice would be to go down to the
dock and look around, if you don't see the boat, petition for summoning.  I
always get an answer, last nite it was just, 'yes, the shuttle from bbm to
FV is running, it's just running slow'.  Before the FP boat was fixed when I
wanted to get from FP to BBM, I got that it was broke and the guide summoned
me to the dock at BBM, I was happy, only took 10 mins to get a response.
