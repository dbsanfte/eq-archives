Ignoring the statement that was made that these will not
be the only focus items.  The summons were put in place
as a means to get them in the world quickly, others will
be dropping from mobs.  

In a  perfect world, the ones from mobs will stack with
the mage summoned ones (ala clarity and FT) and avoid 
rendering these as useful as our summoned armor and weapons.
 
That's unlikely, IMO.  Raid level focus drops will likely
have as good or better bonuses, and better stats.  And
it's already been shown that 2 of the same type of focus
don't stack.  (They're lore, but you can have a lower
level one and a higher level one at the same time.)

No, this is not about mage balance.  This is all about
caster balance in general, and mages make a good method
to get cheap versions out there for people to play with
without flooding the market, or having high drop rates
initially then nerfing them.
