It could be your router.  The security features of my Linksys router think
the EQ server is trying to hack my houses network and disconnects from it.
Apparently this occurs when the EQ server is trying to reconnect to the
client in laggy situations.  This is a "feature" in newer versions of the
linksys bios.  Solution: install a specific bios that doesn't have this
feature. Here is a link to a thread that describes it.

Is it Verants bug?  Is it Linksys's bug?  Who knows.  Computers are damn
complicated, but it would be nice if they worked it out.
