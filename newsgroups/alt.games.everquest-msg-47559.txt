This is just my 2cents, and not meant to be a judgement of you or an insult.
This is, when you get down to it, a game.  You are entirely in control of
how much time you spend playing, and how much effort you put into succeeding
at it.  It may not feel like it sometimes, but ultimately it's up to you to
sit down to play every time.  If you feel that EQ is wasting your life, it's
probably time to quit and find something else to do.  Exchange email
addresses with the friends you've made in EQ, and just hang it up for a
while.  Blaming the game just gives it an illusion of power over you that it
doesn't have, and more importantly makes it easier to absolve yourself of
any responsibility for your own life and actions.  Stop playing EQ, and find
something else to do.  Or at least play it less and use the time for
something more productive that's important to you.  Everquest isn't really
making any demands on your time, and as much as I'm sure Verant loves every
penny they make they probably won't come around to your house trying to make
you play again.  As far as what return it gives, consider the friends you've
made, and the fun you had early on.  You can keep the friends you know, and
the game's only other return is meant to be entertainment.  Not a paycheck,
or a clean house, or feeding the homeless or educating you in any useful
way.  And if it's not entertaining any more...... Well no sense in repeating
myself (again!).

Thanks I do!  I hope you do too, if not with EQ than with something else.  I
for one am going to go for a motorcycle ride before it rains here.  And
yeah, probably play EQ this evening for a couple of hours.
