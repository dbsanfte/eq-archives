Heh.  Considering you claim you've been playing since beta, you sure do seem
particularly clueless.   That or you're trolling pretty hard.   If it's the
trolling, you're not all that good at it anyways, as I don't find myself
motivated to post much more than a short message ensuring that everyone knows
you're full of shit.

Ah well, off to go back to my oh so worthless warrior ; )
