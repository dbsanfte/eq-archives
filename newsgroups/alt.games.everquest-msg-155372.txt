There is a noticable difference between C2 and KEI mana regen (at least at
level 56 there is).  Aside from the fact that KEI rolls in the INT/WIS/MANA
buffs, which really helps tradeskilling.  Last night, I had Aego and KEI
going, so what was I doing with it you ask?  I was farming stupid cats and
spiders in EK.  I am one combine away from having my 5th shawl, and I really
need to get my tailoring moving.
