 I would suggest the second option. Just find a low damage low delay
weapon and just start whacking on critters other people are fighting.
Making sure to ask first of course. Most groups wont care and the extra
damage never hurts. If they have an enchanter don't go around breaking
mezzes or you'll get run out in a hurry. When I used this technique long
ago to get my 2hb, I would wait until the mob was close to 50% and then
assist the main tank.
