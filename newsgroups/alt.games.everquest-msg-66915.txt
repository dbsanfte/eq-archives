I wouldn't recommend it, sorry.  EQ is a GREAT game but it does require
(IMO) at least a middle-class gaming computer, and 200MHz is just way too
old.  Envy hearing players talk about the moon will quickly overcome many
people and make your experience that much worse.

Yup, absolutely you can play the small box game and probably have a hell of
a lot of fun.  But I wouldn't buy it unless you decide that if push comes to
shove you can afford to upgrade your computer (min price about $350 if you
do it yourself, double it at least for store-bought).

EQ is very addictive...very immersive.  If you can't afford to do everything
I suggest you do nothing.
