Try reading his post.  He could get into several other EQ servers and
the chat server.  It is unlikely that the poster has a problem at his
end or with his ISP.  Most likely, the problem was somewhere in
between his ISP and one of Verant's ISPs.  Verant has two datacenters
with EQ servers, and Prexus and the chat server are in different
datacenters, and they are served by different ISPs.
