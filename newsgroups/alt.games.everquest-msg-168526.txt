I'm writing as a level 46 cleric here, so some of this is hearsay. Soloing
in particular is mostly what I've seen/heard rather than what I've done,
and I haven't said much about raids because I haven't *been* on many.

More-or-less agree with you here. Haven't seen much of Shamans soloing;
in a group their ability to slow is extremely useful, and other buffs and
debuffs are invaluable. In a number of ways a shaman is more useful in a
group than a cleric - their healing is less effective, but the MOBs are
doing less damage in the first place, plus they have other nice stuff like
SoW and mana buffs. This may be less true at lower levels.
>
> � Enchanter
> Overpowered

From what I understand - not really. Very useful in a raid or exp group
situation, but not too great at soloing. Somebody who plays an enchanter
can correct me here.

Recently the advent of KEI has made chanters less useful in a group, but
as crowd control experts without peer (and having a pet which can add
damage) I'd regard them as balanced in a group or raid.
>
> � Monk
> Slightly Overpowered

The monks here were really cheesed off by the recent damage mitigation
nerfs. My guess is overpowered previously, balanced or underpowered now.
In a group with a tank and healer a monk is typically welcome. Extremely
useful for pulling due to Feign Death, which means that within broad
limits a monk can usually avoid death. Reduced dependence on gear makes
death less of a disaster.
>
> � Rogue
> Slightly Overpowered

Underpowered. Rogues are by far the worst at soloing, which overcompensates
for their high grouped damage output.

Pretty much agree here, though don't know much about necro grouping at
high levels.
>
> � Cleric
> Balanced

Overpowered for group/raid, probably balanced for soloing. Up through to
level 46, I've never found myself unable to solo. Cleric healing spells
are simply the best available, and the rez line is invaluable for mitigating
exp loss from death, particularly at high levels. The emphasis placed on
protecting the clerics in a raid/group situation speaks for itself.
>
> � Warrior
> Balanced

Underpowered for soloing; past a certain level (20-30 or so? not sure)
warriors effectively can't solo since any MOB they're fighting can cut
their HP faster than vice-versa, and they have no easy escape. Probably
balanced for grouping, relatively low damage output is compensated by
high damage mitigation and hit points.
>
> � Bard
> Balanced

I'm not a bard, so I don't have to pretend that bards are balanced. They're
an absurdly powerful class, both soloing and grouping. Think in terms of
a chanter and shaman rolled into one, as well as having reasonable (but
not great) melee.

However, bards are *also* one of the most intensive classes to play; playing
a bard is a *very* busy activity. This balances out the power of the class
to some extent.
>
> � Magician
> Balanced

Probably so, haven't really seen enough mages in action to judge. The worst
mage I ever saw thought he was a wizard - they would stand back and nuke,
and *not* send their pet in with the melees. Extremely annoying. Mages can
boost a group in nonobvious ways like summoning focus items. Overall
probably balanced for groups, not sure about soloing.
>
> � Druid
> Balanced

Still absurdly overpowered for soloing, due to ability to kite (and later
quad-kite), making them almost impossible to kill in outdoor zones.
Underpowered for grouping; their jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none
approach usually means that for a particular role a druid is rarely the
best choice - they're second-best at *everything*. Their flexibility in
a group can still be useful, however.
>
> � Wizard
> Underpowered at earlier levels, but overall balanced

Probably agree here. Soloing a wizard in early levels is pretty hard due
to the necessary tactics (root/nuke) and no easy/reliable escape method.
Get much easier later on (30+?) when snare kicks in. In high-level groups
a wizard's damage potential is extremely useful, but due to the aggro
caused by nukes they usually come behind cleric/warrior/chanter in a group
or raid.

I've heard of grouped wizard tactics which allow a group of wizards to
group together however ("wizard ping-pong") so perhaps that isn't the
case now.

Before the manaburn nerf I would have said "absurdly overpowered" due
to the ability to deliver massive damage instantly, but that's less the
case now. (And was only ever true at the very high levels.)
>
> � Ranger
> Balanced

Rangers can tank, but not very well; they probably come fourth out of the
tank-capable classes (warrior, paladin, SK, Ranger). Spell line is useful
outdoors; ability to snare and SoW bring the core useful druid abilities
to a group. I understand that bow-kiting is very slow and expensive without
piles of summoned arrows, until Endless Quiver kicks in at 60. Soloing they
can't really go toe-to-toe with the MOBs, and don't have the DOTs and nukes
that allow a druid to kite so effectively. So as for most of the other
melee classes - probably underpowered for soloing, balanced or slightly
underpowered for grouping.
>
> � Shadow Knight
> Balanced, maybe not at raids

SK is second-best tank to a Warrior, generally superior at maintaining
aggro, which is one of *the* main things a tank must do. FD spell makes
them reasonable pullers. Don't know what they're like soloing; most of
the melee classes have problems soloing, expect SKs are no different.
So probably balanced in a group/raid, underpowered soloing.

Paladins have Lay Hands, ergo are useful emergency healers, and at high
levels get rez spells. However, still can't solo well. Probably balanced
for grouping - slightly lower DPS and HP balanced by healing abilities.
They also get a handful of other useful spells. Again, pretty much balanced
for group/raid, underpowered for soloing.

In general the melee classes are poor for soloing past a certain point, as
the MOBs start dishing out a higher proportion of the melee's HP per tick
than vice-versa. This makes them highly dependent on grouping.
