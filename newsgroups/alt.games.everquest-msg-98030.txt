VS procs on every hit, lifetapping for 1.5k

There are several ways of stopping the lifetap, but it involves some serious
damage (monks, rogues, wizards)

I take it from your post you used the chain rune method (last time we killed
VS there was some debate about his lifetap) riposte disc also works (and imo
is better) which monks, warriors and rangers get (rangers being the longest
lasting)

Paladins DA is similar, but its also an agro reducer and means agro moves
elsewhere

If you remember a recent patch, they fixed lifetap procs for the first time
(i.e necro pets lifetap) and this is what I meant about the debate we had on
RuneV stopping VS's lifetap (we were using a ranger to tank with
weaponshield so it was a mute point for us)

>>First off, is this a fairly typical size raid force for our level on the
>>triggered VS?

Yep 2 groups is normal bordering on overkill (once you've killed him a few
times)

>>for the turn-in and immediately got aggro when VS spawned. Backed up
>>after being summoned to pull him to the middle of the room and then
>>called in the troops once aggro was firmly established. But it seemed
>>like a very long, hard fight, even without the lifetap problems raising

We always pull him to the wall and hold him there.

>>their ugly heads. Did we have not enough folks? Bad strategy? Or is that
>>fairly typical?

VS/VSR should be a very fast fight, he only has 18k or so HP (frogs in Seb
have 12k HP) if you go with the riposte disc tanking, the key is to kill him
before the disc ends (20 seconds for a ranger) or his lifetap will just heal
him to full

>>him. How much tougher is he than the triggered version, if at all, and
>>do I need different tactics? Larger raid? Just forget it and wait for
>>the triggered?

They drop totally seperate loots, not sure what you'd be waiting for from VS
when killing VSR?

VS is much tougher then VSR, the lifetap becomes a real issue if he isn't
dead *NOW*

Our VS kill crew generally consists of 1 enchanter, 2-3 clerics, 2-3 monks,
2-3 rogues, 1-3 wizards, 2-3 druids, 1-2 rangers, 1-2 paladins, 2 warriors

The druids won't land any nukes on him though, and hes immune to fire IIRC
(wizards have to use lures, or they aren't any use apart from after-kill
ports....)
