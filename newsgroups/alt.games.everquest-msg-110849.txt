True, but the fact that it's complex doesn't mean it's not real.

I've got to assume that, given two opposite sides, often one side will have
the moral superiority.  Everyone tries to claim it; just listen to the
rhetoric of the environmentalists, the welfare supporters, the abortion
activists, the anit-globalists, the socialists, or the freedom from religion
types.  Each of the above claim morals superiority.  Yet, when it's -right
wing- that takes that stance, then it's a bad thing.  Seems a bit uneven to
me.

Which is aside from the point.  We were arguing the christian virtues of
conservatives, not whether the christians are right or not.

As in many things, Chrisianity is more complicated than a short sentance
answer.  There's a time for peace and love, and then there's a time to
defend what is yours.  Having judgment is knowing the difference between the
two.  When the Cannanites are at the gate, you have a responsiblity to
defend your lands and family, not just a right to do so.  Please don't judge
a religion harshly simply because it can't be distilled into a sound bite.
