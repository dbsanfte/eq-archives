No, it depends on whether or not you want to have your stats as good
as they can be since nothing else really matters at creation. Wisdom
is the only stat that matters for a cleric, the other stuff fixes
itself and piling every point you had in stamina will only get you
about 20 more hit points at level 60. Any race cleric can max wisdom
and still have the points to make agil 75, which is in the long run
the only other creation choice that matters. You could pile your
remaining points into Str, Sta whatever but those are small changes 
for a cleric and won't affect its abilities over its lifetime.

Why shoot yourself in the foot starting out if you have another
choice? Your friend could have also handed her stuff to a buddy,
deleted her char, made a new one with the same name, got the stuff and
been back to level 15 in a couple days (especially now) with stats
which are more in line with being an enchanter for the rest of her EQ
career. She WOULD have been the same character again. She could have 
even roleplayed it saying she had to go off to "finishing school" or 
"Enchanters College." 
Putting all your points into the WRONG stats does not make you an
"average" character, it makes you possibly a rather messed up BELOW
average  one until you one day can fix it with gear. In the
enchanter's case putting 20 points into STR and not knowing about
enchanter's needing 
int and charisma is QUITE a bit worse than being a cleric with 90
wisdom.

??? Boy is that really not the point at all. Everyone can easily get a
high charisma kit together for purchases but you only use it for
purchases. Charisma is not your warriors main stat = moot point.
As a wis or int caster you don't have a lil main stat kit that you
switch on sometimes, you ALWAYS want to have that high wis or int.

Actually its the only reason to start over since for a cleric it is
all that matters (as long as your agil is at least 75) The best reason
to start over is that the char is only level 15 now and you'd be
surprised how fast it will be 15 again. 1 - 15 is nothing once you've
done it before. If the player is a dark elf or dwarf (halfling too I
thnk?) it should have 28 more wisdom, that is a BUNCH. If its a human
cleric I think it can have at least 20 or 25 more, even the lesser
cleric races it could have about 15 more. Even at the uber stage that
is TWO or THREE fairly good item slots.
