I have to agree with Lokari...if you can't handle a little frustration (and
you're in for another couple hours, btw) you SHOULD pick an easy game to get
the hang of in the first 30 minutes.

Weird thing...no one's ever said the "A" in "AC" stands for "addicting."  No
one's ever even HINTED that AC is addicting...and yet, that's the main
adjective (or probably adverb, but I'm late for lunch and don't feel like
thinking :) ) people use when describing EQ.
