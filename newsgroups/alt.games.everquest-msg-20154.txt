I almost want to say it is the rule now that GMs are anon as they are always
recieving tells from upset players when they are not.  Also make sure you report
two things, 1) the critter hitting you first, then him killing it.  2) any
exchanges where you try to reason with him.  Then petition (makesure you tell them
you have multiple reports in).  You only get one petition so make sure you have as
much info in it as possible, (I wish it opened up a bug screen personally).
