But we're going to be able to keep mobs from gating!

Does that change you opinion?

Let me guess, you said "Mobs can gate?"

I'd say you're wasting your breath (fingers?).

Wizards are fight enders...
we suck at starting fights...
we suck at prolonged fights...
we suck at this mythical support role (except FIRE SUPPORT)...

but if you want a fight finished...  irrefutably... call a wizard.

"I ain't gonna start nothin'
but I sure as HELL am gonna finish it."

In military terms... we are self propelled artillery.  You want the target
blasted... fast and hard... point me in the direction and call "Wiskey 45
this is Tango 49... Fire mission, over."

"Tango 49... Wiskey 45... outgoing fire."

"boom."

Now, I point out... the artillery analogy is good... since, if artillery
fires too much, it gives away it's position, and draws a counter attack...

Artillery is NOT armoured for direct battle.

A properly equiped SNIPER can disable an artillery platoon...
though maybe the apache kill is more demonstrative... if an apache (attack
helicopter) fires on a tank, it uses Anti-Tank missles... to take out
artillery, it can use its cannon (30mm "machine gun").

Point is artillery, properly used is simply devestating... improperly used
it does a lot of damage, draws return fire and is destroyed without a lot of
force (ultimately doing less damage to the enemy than if it had been
employed right in the first place).
