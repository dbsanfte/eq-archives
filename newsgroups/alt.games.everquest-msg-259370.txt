On every occasion I've bothered to check out any "lag" regarding Diablo, the
problem has been something at their end.

I've never had DSL, but I've had Comcast cable for years.  Most likely
you'll never notice the difference.  Comcast is doing a really good job and
makes continual improvements/upgrades to their network, at least where I am.
I'm well pleased with cable in general and Comcast in particular.
