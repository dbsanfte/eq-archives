Well, open your inventory screen when you are damaged, look at your hp 
total.  See how much it goes up each tick, that's your current regen 
rate.  Next try sitting, and watching it, that's your current sitting 
regen rate.  The regen AAs add one point of regen per level, so that's 
easy to subtract out.  Equipment can be removed and put back on to see 
how much difference it makes. Really, it's not difficult.
