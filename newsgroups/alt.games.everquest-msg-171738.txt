I've started making some of the research only mage spells.  You can
now buy corncopia but everfount is still research only to the best of
my knowledge.  I was a bit disappointed that the mage 44 earth pet was
now available for purchase since it required researching the 39 earth
pet (which is still research) just to make it.  I figure that would
have sold quite well.  Unlike others I enjoyed the effort of research.
I was disappointed that the above 49 spells can't be made by research.
