1) Getting mana viles with out a friend thats a chanter is a pain....Its
takes 200mana to cast the spell
2) getting silk is a little pain
3) brewing isn't that bad
4) getting tailoring that high is a real pain in the ....

I have been sellign arms 100, tunic and legs for 150 and all the other item
for 50... How ever do to the pain and time it takes to get all of the items
I only make arms , tunic and legs , rest is waist of silk cause I no longer
have a chance to raise tailoring skill.
