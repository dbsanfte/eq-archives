I know the 'child' in question was a 21 year old son of this woman.
However, it is still the monther's issue that is she had concerns and knew
about his problems...  The act of expecting or having a lawyer help sue
Verant about putting a warning sign on a box...  It is like saying, "Hey...
You shouldn't have to care about the love one and do something about it...
You should sue the other person for not putting adequate warnings on the
box to disuade them not to do it."

The signs were there, and it seemed to hinted that she was in regular
contact with her son.  If she were truly concerned, she would have done
something sooner, and helped him with his problem, instead of suing after
the fact and expecting things to change.

As someone said...  There aren't a bunch of warning signs in France for
canyons, yet we have a crap load of them.  Guess it shows how much
sheep-herding we need now.
