i don't know about a going rate. but if i was you, i'd pay someone for you
to help them. you wouldn't believe how fast your tracking skill will
increase. i got 20PP plus my skill raised by 50 to help track some guys.
it's amazing. then that very same day i made an additional 30PP or so, and
my skill raised again by 20. it's amazing.
