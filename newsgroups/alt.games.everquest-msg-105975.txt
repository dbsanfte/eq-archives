I assumed nothing. You snipped the part where you conflate the two.

I don't think so. Regardless of the words he uses his own examples
clearly show he was showing the difference between 40% increased
attack speed vs 40% decreased delay.

"- Haste is measured in Damage Increase, not Delay Decrease."

His own words show he is comparing directly to delay decrease, nothing
else. That's the context. With that in mind, it is obvious he refers
to damage increase as the same thing as number of attacks increase.

His wording leaves something to be desired, but I see no evidence he
doesn't know the difference between damage and number of attacks.
After all, in practice they work out the same - 40% haste will lead to
40% more damage inflicted.

In the end it is the same thing. Damage is just more random.
