Absolutely true. However, I don't believe being frequently bugged by
other players for spells was an intended con of any of the classes I
mentioned.

I agree again. I'm regularly amazed at how long people will sit in a
zone begging for a sow (or a port) - often, had they simply started
running when they started begging, they would have gotten there much
more quickly.

And you're also right, by extension, that no one *needs* a SoW, or a
port, or anything else. I certainly understand why people want them,
of course, and I'm happy to help when I can, but "need"? Hardly!
