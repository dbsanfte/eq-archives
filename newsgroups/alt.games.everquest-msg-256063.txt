Here's my Magelo at 45, a mix of gear inherited from a vague 
acquaintance who quit the game and some stuff I found in the bargain bin 
in the bazaar.

I can pull in pretty good cash doing Geonids these days, and could spend 
a few kpp on upgrades if there's anything obviously lacking.

Not shown on the Magelo are some hand tailored backpacks and one tink 
bag, plus some misc junk like SOW potions, Cloudy Potions, and coldain 
ring 4.

The fungus covered great staff is new yesterday, I spent much of my 
remaining "inheritance" on it, couldn't believe it was BER usable.  I 
have one on my shaman and made great use of it before getting stoicism 
and some of the higher level regen buffs; as a BER I doubt I'll be 
outgrowing it any time soon.
