You haven't grouped with me.... If I am FM... I be swinging....
in fact I got a few emotes to go along with my Battle Cleric mode.
I usually take up a position behind the mob to prevent any dents to my
armor... but hey....  I sometimes even Hit the beast I am attacking...
I can get some 30's for damage..  but usually:
You try to crush %t but miss.
or You crush %t with 3 pts damage.

Quindell thinks he is a Rogue.
Quindell Back stabs for 1000.
Quindell swarms over %t as a living DoT.
Quindell becomes a Living DoT.

I have gotten several compliments on my BS.... hehe in fact had one
guy say... Hey, I didn't know clerics had BS...

Lots of fun... and leave us pussy fat assed lazy bastard Clerics
alone....     

/em makes mental note to wear virticle stripes instead of horizontal.
