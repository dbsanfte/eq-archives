I started a Iksar Necro and was loving it until I got my Lev 4 spells.
However once I get Darkpact at 8 I'll be happy again.  Any way my question
is where should I be hunting at level 5.  I was doing Frogloks in SONH but
when I got mobbed twice and had to run from FOB to retrieve my body I got a
little tired of it.  Should I just stick it out there or are there other
places to go?

I've searched a few sites and can't seem to find a good Iksar Necro guide.
The one on IGN is about horrible IMOP.
