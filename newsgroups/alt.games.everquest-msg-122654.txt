    Hey, I'm looking to join a guild, but I find it so damned hard to find
one that:

a. Is recruiting
b. Isn't filled to it's brim with fucking tools that just made it like an
hour ago
c. Has at least ONE other member on at any time I get online. I play at
fucked-up, sporatic times of day, and need a guild with members spanning a
few time zones  to accomodate my crackheadish playing schedule. :P

Anyway - I'm a good, solid, semi-roleplaying, semi-all-about-being-a-wiseass
Level 34 Ranger named Dankweid. I play on the Xev server. If anyone out
there has a spot in a guild that meets any of the above requirements, I'm
willing to meet or exceed any of your requirements of me. <interview off>
