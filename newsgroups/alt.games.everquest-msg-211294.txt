Echo cavens is always a good choice.

Needlites are awesome exp, even in a duo you should get 2% a kill with ease,
If you can, group with either a DS capable class or a very high dmg dealer
(or better yet get a mage and have both).
Needlites only have around 450-500hp (except for the queen who has more,
hits harder and procs a nasty dot) but hit manically fast, think of a monk
after 20 cups of black coffee and then double that speed and your getting
close =) but any DS will make short work of these guys.

Boglings are pretty good too, and you can lull them to make sure you only
get one at a time, they tend to hit harder than the needlites and give less
exp, but on the plus side then are pretty slow hitters, once again a Duo
would work well here, maybe go for a melee class here.
