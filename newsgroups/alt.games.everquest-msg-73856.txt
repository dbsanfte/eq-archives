Hey Dstep,

I wouldn't sweat some of the dumber responses to your thread (like the one
previous this).  They're just fanboys for the "Denmom" who can't stand *any*
criticism of their cult leader.  Hey, like you said, you had a concern and you
decided to post your observation on usenet.  That's what the internet is for -
free exchange of information.

That's called Free Speech.  Good job standing up to the Nazi Denleader and her
Gestapo trolls.  You can tell, from her response on her website, that she's
some sort of control freak.

Irritates her all to hell that she can't "ban" you from posting your opinions. 
But then, this is America.  More power to you!
