Group,

My friend and I recently journeyed to Runnyeye to find the Gloves of
Rallos Zek for his level 39 Earth Pet.  The Gloves are a spell
component.  We killed many Goblins, all of them on level 3, but did
not find the Gloves.  

Does anyone know if the Gloves are still dropped in Runnyeye?  Also,
are they dropped anywhere else?

Thanks,
Julie
