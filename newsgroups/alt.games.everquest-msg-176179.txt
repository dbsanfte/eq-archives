    You'd be very, very surprised how well I can do with stuff that anyone
with a level 50 druid or necromancer could farm. Check out, as an example,
the items required for the Earring of the Solstice some time. I can tell
you, from sales experience, that on my server there's about ten new earrings
being made per day. And those people getting those earrings will pay very
well for items like the Robe and the Sickle, items that require squat in the
way of "exotic" drops.

    It just isn't a good reason. Consider the following model: on any
combine involving dropped components (as opposed to store-bought
components), the character doing the combine gains some fraction of the XP
that killing the monster that dropped those components gives. When you get a
skill-up, you get a skill point in addition to the skill raise in your trade
skill. So a tradeskiller could level up, but slowly, and could keep some of
his skills current, but at the cost of cash. He'd also be dependent on
others for the best tradeskill items. Imagine that system in place since day
1 of EQ - would it have become a total failure, or something workable? You'd
need to juggle what items are makeable with what drops (so no robes that
take you to 250 skill using nothing dropped but spider silks, for example),
but that's details, not basic model design.

    The non-planar trade skills are pretty nice, too. FT 1 earring via
quest, illusion: wood elf item (all/all) via quest, warrior armour better
than most items pre-NToV, and your personal favourite, Tunare cultural
fletching stuff!
