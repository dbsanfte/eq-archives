I have a big-ass dictionary that I um..."borrowed" when I moved out from my
parents for situations just like this:

Irony, n ; pl: ironies
1. A method of humorous or sarcastic expression in which the intended
meaning of the words used is the direct opposite of their usual sense; as,
the speaker was using irony when he said that the stupid plan was "very
clever."
2. an instance of this
3. a combination of circumstances or a result that is the opposite of what
might be expected or considered appropriate; as, it was an irony of fate
that the fireboat burned and sank.
4. The feigning of ignorance in arguement: more frequently socratic irony
(after Socrates, who usees this device in Plato's Dialogues)

Please read the section below (helpfully retained rather than being
trimmed), and take a long, hard look at definition 3, and see how maybe it
just MIGHT apply to you. I won't blame you if you can't make sense of it,
since you have the functioning intellect of curdled yogurt, but there is
always hope.
