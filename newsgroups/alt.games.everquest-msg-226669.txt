    Hard adventures give good XP. Hard 65 gives about 1 AA point for a 60
minute mission, with good group selection. Compared with 50 minutes per AA
in Earth with less stringent group selection that's not exceptional. It's
still very good, though, and the LDoN adventure gives character advancement
options that XP in Earth does not. I'm willing to bet that from 55+, doing
Hard will give the XP that people are used to in PoP, mostly because of the
level bonus. (From what I've seen, Hard 65 trash mobs are levels 63-65.)
