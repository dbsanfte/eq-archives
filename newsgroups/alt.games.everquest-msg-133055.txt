Haaken Loogies

Doharm Toyourmom

one day i felt silly as hell, reported myself, and got monk name changed to
Pada Deathless (cuz i only died 3X from 20-40)

my (erudite) wizard's last name was "Harlemglobeporter"  - and i take that
to be my greatest eq accomplishment, though wiz = deleted

but Haaken Loogies lives ! i've even met 2 guides (see? HATE guides, they're
so inept) who never said anything
