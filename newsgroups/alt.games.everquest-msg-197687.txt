Okay, the fact that we won't actually need to do trials in a few weeks has 
actually sparked some renewed excitement in my guild about doing 'em 
/boggle.

One of the people who desperately needs his flag is a level 61 (he may be 
62 now) Shaman.  We had good success last night getting two unflagged 
people through in a single shot: a 60 Baron ranger and a 58 Rogue with no 
title.  Others in the group included a 64 (maybe 65) Warrior, 60 Wizard, 65 
Enchanter, and a Cleric whose level I'm not sure on.

They're now looking at maintaining this basic structure, but replacing the 
Ranger with the Shaman and replacing the Rogue with a wizard or mage.  I'm 
thinking that the former is going to create a deficit that's not going to 
be covered by gains made from the latter (unless the mage were to get 
really lucky with banishment).  I'm thinking replace the enchanter with the 
shaman, get a higher level rogue and replace the ranger with a mage (we 
still have a 60 mage who "needs" her flag).

So now my questions are: What are your thoughts on the proposed 
compositions listed above?  What was the makeup of the group when your 
shaman got their flag?

Thanks in advance,
