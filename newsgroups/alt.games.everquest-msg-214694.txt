Even for the Ogre who starts out with so much STA anyway?  Just
checking.

Which leads to another question.  Sorry.  <grin>  Is it best to have
all weapons skills maxed or is there a weapon of choice for the
shaman.  Is this just a matter of preference?  For instance, I've
always thought a druid might focus on keeping their 1hs maxed since
his/her epic is a one hand slashing weap.  Not having played a druid
this might not be a good idea I don't know, but is there a similar
thinking with the shaman at all?  <grin>
