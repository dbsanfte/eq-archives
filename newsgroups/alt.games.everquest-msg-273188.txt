The difference is the tasks you will be assigned (make 10 of item X vs 
collect Y of item X), and the items available for sale.  In particular, 
the level 10 and higher recipe books for the specific classes that can 
join the society are sold.

You can see the standing by looking at your societies window.  I am not 
100% certain of how it functions, whether everyone sees the same items 
based on the level of the society, or it is based on the amount of status 
an individual has with the society.
