Ok, will you enlighten me on how religous expression is prohibited except
where people who may not agree with that religion will have no choice but to
be present at such "expression" sessions?

Now, I think I ought to clear up a point here.  I have no argument with
school children praying together *in private* at school.  What I disagree
with is prayer in areas where other children not of their religion are
required to be, at times when when they are required to be there.
Expression of religion is fine, but only when everyone present is there by
choice to be at the religous services.  Note that this does not include
places such as a town square... while nobody there is being forced to stay
and listen, it is a public place, and they have every right to be there.  To
pray in your town square is to say, in effect, "Listen to us pray or leave
this public place to which you have as much a right as we do!"  It's similar
to the case of nudist colonies.  People can walk around nude in private
places where the owner/owners of the place do not disagree with their
nudity.  But to do so in a public place or a private place without the
agreement of the owner(s) is a violation of the rights of people who may or
may not want to see that.
