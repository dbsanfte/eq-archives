Dunno, perhaps what they should fix is that attitude that EQ is a
grouping game. Cant be sure but Im willing to bet almost half the
players are soloing out there from  mid to high levels. Have a lot of
respect for both classes and think that with a change in attitude by
verant we could have epics and other major quests that really can be
done without an uber-guild or in fact CANT be  done grouped, zones
where traditional grouping is a death sentence, and in general making
life better for a large part of the players. Naw wont happen....
