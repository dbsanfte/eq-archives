Personally, I went back and did the AC camp in OOT again just for the
bragging rights after I got my first set of JBoots. Mind you, that
first time took me about a week of work (and repeated camps) to get.

Anyhow, I decided to go back just for the heck of it and try again. I
promised myself that if anyone wanted the camp, I would give it up to
them and go hunt Seafuries. I just wanted the chance to have BOTH
JBoots and the AC ring on me at the same time...

What happens? I get on just after a patch, call up my pet, kill the
placeholder, sit down to meditate (I was the only person in OOT at the
time). And damn near have a heart attack when the AC shows on the very
next 'pop'!

I love it when every so often someone inspects me and realizes what
they are looking at. ; )
