 Well I took a chance and did my final combine for my silk shawl with
a skill of ~94 in tailoring. I got lucky. Really, even with a skill of
200 you're still not assured of a success. You can still fail occasionally,
which really sucks of course. I figured "what the heck", pumped up my INT
to like 240 or 250 and did it. WOOT, Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl on my 
pointer!
