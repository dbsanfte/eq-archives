Intelligence maxes out at 255, same as the other stats.  By the time you're
level 60, you've undoubatably acquired enough gear to reach that if you really
wanted to. (unless you're a career soloer or some such thing).

If you're not over 200 int (where you start getting diminishing returns) by
the mid 50's, you're doing something wrong.  No matter what race you started
as.
