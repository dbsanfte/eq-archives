It is really interesting how different these themes are rated. :)
I do think Ruj is easieast followed by Mir, MMC and Tak. I've never done
a Guk adventure since no group is willing to try it out. This list does
apply to normal difficulty though. I just dinged 65 and waiting to get
some helpful AAs before I'm going to try hard LDoNs with my bard.
The reason I rate these dungeons in this order is due to the difficulty
pulling them. Ruj usually are wide open spaces with fast running mobs
but seldem more than 2 Mobs in aggro range. In the rare cases I have to
lull more than one mob I often end up just pulling two and lull as less
as possible.
Miragul is a bit harder since I just miss those skeletons in these
bright blue dungeons. But besides that it is usually easily pullable.
MMC would be about same as Mir when there weren't those annoying
spiderwebs. I just can't target a Mob through them. F8 won't work if
there is a mob before and one after the web. Other than this minor
annoyance mobs are packed more tightly imho. So it's more difficult to
pull than Mir.
And last Tak makes for the most interesting pulls as mobs tend to stand
in range of at least one another. Also they are placed near the door
when you enter a room. That's what makes Tak the hardest theme for me.
Casters are not so much an issue since I usually have Psalm of Veeshan
up and the only thing that penetrates these resistances is enchanter
mobs casting rapture. :/
