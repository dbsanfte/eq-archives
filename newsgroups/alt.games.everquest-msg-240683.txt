PST (Pacific Standard Time)  is GMT-8
PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) is GMT-7

SOE flips from PST to PDT along with the rest of most of the continent
to observe daylight savings... as Germany also does this when you
switch to GMT+2 they'll shift to PDT (GMT-7) and the number of hours
between the two will remain the same. (9 hours). 

The exception being on the day of the switch, as the world doesn't
simultaneously switch, but rather each zone that observes it switches
at (usually) 2am local time...and for a number of hours you'll go to
GMT+1 while SOE is still on PDT... or you'll go to GMT+2 while SOE is
still in PST....and in both cases for a few hours you won't be 9 hours
apart... but that's nitpicking ;)
