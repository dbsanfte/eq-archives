An environment that allows all the things that the typical griefer thrives 
on, yet you have no patience for it. Sounds like a match made in Heaven. 
Would you enter into a snowball fight with the biggest jerks in the 
neighborhood and expect them to respect the rule of no head shots?

These people get what they consider respect from others just like them for 
this kind of crap. You can't stop the griefers and scum, so ya best just 
get used to it and rock on.

Or is it, "All's fair in EQ and war"?
