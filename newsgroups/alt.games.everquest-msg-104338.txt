I've been pharming pieces for my guild for a while now. When I take
people on the VP tour, here's the circuit I follow:

Kaesora: ground spawn, fairly easy
- invis to the tunnel, ITU to the library, grab then succor to zoneout
(a guild shammie was stunned when I asked for ITU potions)

WW: staff turnin, easy with a "but"
- need the burnished wooden staff from chardok
- bring a chanter or use sneak if you have it, turnin mob is an iksar

SoNH: ground spawn, easy

FV: ancient jarsath, easy
- wanders around a lot, bring a tracker
- watch out for adds

LOIM: bloodgill marauder, easy
- not often up

DL: rotting skeleton, easy
- static spawn, 8 min spawn, iirc

After that, things are a bit more challenging:

Chardok: turnin to Niblik, fairly easy
- bring black sapphire and ruby
- mob is in the mines, bring an xp group

TT: Pained Soul, hard
- static spawn by Sebilis
- took me 4.5 hours to spawn the PoS...err, PS
- think it's a 12 min spawn

KC: Verix Kylox's Remains, hard
- basement is usually camped
- think it's a 20 min spawn
- I duoed the basement (60 druid, 60 SK) but bring a group if you can,
xp can be very good

Seb: Trakanon, hard
- biggest problem is finding him up
- kill juggs, make sure Trak is at the back of the lair
- we do 3 waves: 1 to trigger AE, 1 with tanks & healers, 1 with
nukers when Trak is at 50
- give Tolapumj a hug for me

Good luck! Btw the medallions and tooth can be MQed.
