    I saw that with my little gnome mage. It wouldn't accept the last name
"Sprocket", or "Sprockett" (first name "Sprickett", she's a tinkergnome). I
tried on several different days, too, just to make sure. I almost get the
idea that the name filter is looking for banned character strings imbedded
in otherwise normal names. So if "rocket", say, were banned, so would be
"Sprockett".
