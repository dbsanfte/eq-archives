Yes and no.  There are certain zones that are pretty remote and you're 
likely to be the only person there, but the very fact that they are so 
remote makes it inconvenient.  When you want to do this, ask again and 
tell us what city you are near, and we'll give you suggestions as to the 
best place nearby.

Nope, the alt key only works on your bank and bags.  Most stuff on the 
ground looks like a bag or a weapon, but you have to be paying attention 
to see it.

> What happens when you die when you already have a corpse ?

When you die your corpse stays where you died, and you pop up naked at 
your bind point.  You have to run to your corpse and loot it to get your 
gear back.  You will also lose exp when you die, but there are spells that 
high level clerics can cast that will restore a percentage of that exp.  
Don't worry about this until level 40 or so.

> Does the corpse return to town when you quit the game ?

Nope, corpses stay where they are, unless dragged by a character.  You can 
drag your corpse by typing /corpse near it (useful when it's near a 
monster, since looting it drops invis).  You can also allow someone else 
to drag your corpse by typeing /consent playername.  They will not be able 
to loot your corpse, though this was allowed originally.

Nope, can't mule between servers, and other than special rules servers, 
they are pretty much the same.  If you're in Europe you might want to 
create a character on Antonious Bayle, as it's the only server located in 
Europe.  All other servers are located in San Diego.  There will be Asian 
servers this summer.

I would recommend getting either the basic game first or the Trilogy.  
Unless you have a really fast system or a serious desire to play a Vah 
Shir, there really is no reason to get Luclin if you're just trying the 
game out.
