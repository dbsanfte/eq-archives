I agree 100 percent. It's the whole reason why I bought the game, really.

For a month or so, I had gotten into the loot and leveling rut. Progress was
actually nice for me, split between four characters, and as I leveled I got
to hunt in areas I once had to run through. But then it became a chore.
Annoying if I didn't make progress. Then I just grew bored and did not log
on for two, maybe three weeks.

I picked up and started playing again this weekend for the first time in a
bit. First thing I did was pick up my ranger from where he was - in the EC
tunnel, trying to buy those last few Ivy Etched parts - and decided I was
going to head back to my roots. Exploring.

Almost no "progress" in many hours of play. Less than a bubble of exp, maybe
20 or 30 plat in loot. No big deal, I had a blast. Visited zones I had never
been in before, like Kerra Isle and The Warrens. Talked to every NPC I could
find, looking for bits of game lore. Just wandered, did what rangers do.
Great stuff.

It made the game fun again. The first time I had a severe break from EQ was
last spring, when I set aside the game for two months or so. Was boring me
to tears. Then these fellows dragged me along with them through a number of
zones I had never been in before, never read about before, and were way too
high level for me. (I was a lvl 6 ranger in Surefallat the time, and had
never been further than West Karana) Then ran me all the way to Freeport.
Wow! The game breathed new life.

So, anyway, yeah, you're right on target. Except for lack of "progress,"
exploring is the best part of the game.
