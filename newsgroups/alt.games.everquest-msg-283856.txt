In my experience, when that happens... it is because your spell HAS expended 
some mana the moment you hit the button. Then you try again and it says you 
do not have enough, because it is gone and must regenerate again.

Not sure if all classes react the same anyway (a beastlord is not a cleric) 
so I can't comment on other classes. I just know that when I cast a spell 
and it is interupted or fizzles... mana most definitely has been expended. 
It does not magically re-appear. The moment the spell is cast, you see the 
points drain and it does not stop until the spell is stopped, either by 
completion or other means of "stoppage."

Thanks to whoever brought up the duck technique. I have never heard of it 
before, and intend to start using it. I can see that it will be a very 
valuable tool.

See? I do learn from people here... either in beneficial ways such as this 
tip, or in learning who to avoid... :D
