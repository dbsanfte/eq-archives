Sadly, your chest slot item on a caster (normally a robe) will often be
the only visible piece of gear. It overrides almost all the other slots.
As to patterns, you don't need different ones for leather, silk, etc.
(The low end stuff.) Just a "belt pattern" will make either leather or
silk, depending what you're putting in the kit with it. If you leave E.
Freeport and head into Norther Desert of Ro, there will be an Inn there.
Go to the merchant on the left inside. (Spooge something). He sells all
the patterns, as well as "how to sew" books and large sewing kits. He'll
hook you up with what you need, aside from the silk, of course.
