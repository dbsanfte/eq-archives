Thanks, Graeme.  I'm a Dark Elf rogue - and I understand that rogues are
difficult to solo, so in truth I'm not entirely surprised that the going is
slow.  In actual fact, I think before that brief burst of flame made me lose
interest in clearing up misunderstandings, it's fair to say that I've been
on and off EQ perhaps more than I made clear at first, so I apologise if I
wasn't clear at first.  I certainly only dedicate an hour or so each session
to the game, if that, and don't play every day (or even every week) and I
know that can put a crimp on opportunities for grouping - I don't like to
commit to a group as often as I perhaps could because I'm conscious of the
fact that I can't devote as much time as I'd like.

And, if I have to be totally frank, Dr Sisson there did hit one nail on the
head.  I must admit to some...  let's be trendy and call them 'issues'...
that make me simply prefer my own company sometimes.  I know that's not the
point of a MMORG, but I play it because generally speaking I enjoy it,
sometimes I like grouping up with folks, and in an effort to be reasonably
honest I chose a Dark Elf because it would let me indulge the loner in me
when I wanted to.

Yeah, I've just discovered what Nexus Scions do!  (Sad, innit?)  But being a
DE rogue, and knowing the 'noble' reputation of the folks up on Luclin, am I
likely to get murdered the minute I set foot on the moon (I gather that's
where the caverns are)?

Thanks for your patience there, by the way, it's appreciated.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
