Does it really have to be a severe thunderstorm for %50 of the time in
this game ? Who at sony thought that it would be a good gaming
experience to have to play in a never-ending, biblical/noah type
downpour ? 

Every 5 seconds a loud monstrous boom that is slowly shaking my
speakers from their brackets rings out loudly. It was a nice effect
for the first twenty times. Now I can see that soon i'll be in padded
room babbling on about thunder and monsters.

Is there any way to turn off the thunder sounds ?

Cheers,
