I hadn't thought about this till I read your post but I have a
tendency to ignore rogues when I'll looking to fill a DPS slot in a
pickup group. Not really sure why, maybe it's subconscious due to one
to many bad experiences with pickpocketing rogues in the past. Maybe
because all the other DPS classes bring something else to the table
that I like and rogue lvl DPS just isn't required for normal
adventures. <shrug>
