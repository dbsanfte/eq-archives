Some people CLAIM that it's still possible to cheat on a random.  I
seriously doubt it since /random is in a user-defined color and not everyone
uses that same color.  SOMEONE will notice when there's slime in your group
attempting it.

BUT, just to make people happy the safest way is to make it really random.
One person rolls, say, from 400 to 500 (/rand 400 500) and then EVERYONE
rolls to whatever number that one person just rolled.

Leader: /random 400 500 -   455 is the result

Leader /random 455
Mbr1 /random 455
Mbr 2 /random 455
Mbr 3 /random 455
Mbr 4 /random 455
Mbr 5 /random 455

I think it's totally unnecessary but you do what makes people feel
comfortable if it doesn't take too much time...and it doesn't.
