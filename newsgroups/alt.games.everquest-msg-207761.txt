Then you aren't tanking, you are sponging.

Tanks sponge and deal damage, "DPS" types deal damage, "Sponges" soak 
damage.  Shaman make pretty decent sponges, especially because our melee 
DPS is so low that using Stoicism/Torpor on ourselves doesn't noticably 
reduce the group's damage output... in fact I've taken to refusing to 
turn the attack button on, so that I can get my mounted mana regen while 
being beat to a pulp.
