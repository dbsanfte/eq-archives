It's kind of funny.  With root and nuke, I can just barely take a blue by
myself (with +9 in wis jewlery and armor my wisdom is 99).  I've been taking
on mostly yellows with some reds with my wife who is a level 15 enchanter
(She made 15 in the field with the scarecrows).  Enchanters really annoy
mobs.  My druid cannot get them off of her.  A couple of hits and she goes
down so she occassioanlly panics and runs away.  Actually after 1 hit she
always panics and runs.  I used to tell her to quit running.  Now I just
tell her to run straight.  I follow along behind her slashing away with my
combine scimitar.  So the way to do it is:

1. root
2. Druid dots and DDs
2. Echanter does stuff
3. Root breaks
4. Mob completely ignores druid, who is right in his face hacking at him,
and attacks enchanter
5. Enchanter runs away
6. Druid follows slashing and "steering"

I call it reverse enchanter kiting.  I would really love to see this from a
different perspective.  hehe We tend to do things uniquely.
