Oh, I completely agree that it may not work at all. I don't think I 
implied anything different. The OP merely mentioned the possibility of 
getting up and running just to play EQ while waiting for his Windows 
install CD. Popping the old hard drive into the new machine strictly on a 
temporary basis is worth a shot on such a temporary basis. If it works, 
great, he can play in the meantime. If it doesn't, no loss. The idea I 
got was that he had no OS disc yet with which to attempt a fresh install. 
What I suggested wouldn't affect his schedule in that scenario.
