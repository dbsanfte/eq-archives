For the benefit of those from whom Lucy will not work, this is what she
says about the first link:

Wears off: Your mind returns to normal. 
Game Description: Calms your group's thoughts, allowing them to
regenerate mana more quickly, as well as increasing their wisdom,
intelligence, and mana pool. 
 
  
The other spells on Lucy are very similar, with the last one increasing
one's mana pool by 100 rather than 20.

The person who posted on the TC forums also added:

"Now, the EQ RPG has a recipe for this one, as follows:

Vial of mana, grapes, sugar, yeast, brewing barrel."

One can wonder if these will make it into the Oct. 8th patch.  If they
do, I hope they can be stacked into groups of 20.  If each need their
own slot, I know know that they will make much of a difference.  Also
curious if they will stack with clarity, KEI, and all the rest.
