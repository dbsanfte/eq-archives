There is a book in FV, but it's in some sort of tunnel system.  I
spent a good half hour down there wandering around, kept coming out in
fields full of spiders, and I've been killed WAY more than enough
times to try running through them.  Eventually zoned into DL, saw yet
another field full of spiders, thought "fuck it", and suicided my way
back to PoK (yay, level 9 insta-port).  I REALLY need to update my
maps...
