Nooooooo!

Befallen is the, number one, sucky dungeon in the game. Very boring
architecture since it's just a bunch of ruined rooms. It's got no
character or spectacle to it. Go to Black Burrow for something far
more exciting.

Add a very sharp transition in levels of the mobs, necromancer DOT's
which are very mean at that level, small rooms containing multiple
foes and *both* key system and pit traps and I would avoid like the
plague unless you have a full and balanced group.
