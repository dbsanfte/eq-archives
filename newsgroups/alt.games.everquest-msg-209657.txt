Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right
for you, may not be right for some. A man is born, he's a man of means. Then
along come two, they've got nothin' but their jeans. But they've got,
Diff'rent Strokes. It takes, Diff'rent Strokes. It takes, Diff'rent Strokes
to move the world.

Everybody's got a special kind of story. Everybody finds a way to shine. It
don't matter that you got... not a lot, so what? They'll have theirs, you'll
have yours, and I'll have mine. And together we'll be fine. Because it
takes, Diff'rent Strokes to move the world, yes it does. It takes, Diff'rent
Strokes to move the world!

HTH
