Today I was fighting spectres in Oasis and my levitation suddenly went off.
I fell into the water and sunk down to the aqua goblins. Suddenly they
started to chain cast me and my health was falling so fast.

Suddenly then I appeared in the ocean of tears and a GM said to me they were
watching my progress on the spectres and thought I was brave and he was the
one that saved my life and that he wanted me to add him to my friend list.
When I told him that he was a camp stealer and stole my kills he got mad and
started to swear at me. I didn't turn my log on in time so I couldn't record
it.

After this I was teleported to another zone or something loaded and I saw a
dragon called Kerafyrm who asked me what I was doing in his lands and unless
I zone right away he would kill me. I ran so fast out of there because he
was starting to cast spells. I zoned and ended up in a magical mystical zone
with a bunch of bright flashing lights and flying unicorns. The GM showed up
again and asked me what the hell I was doing here and how I found out how to
enter this secret zone. I told him Kerafyrm rushed me out of his temple door
and I ended up there.

The GM was SOOOO mad that he just slayed me and I ended back up at my bind
point Freeport. I don't know how the hell I can get my gear back, if anyone
wants to help me or tell me how to get back to the secret magic land it
would be awesome.

Thanks!!
