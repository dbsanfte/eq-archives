Yes, it does. Any GM or guide logged in will get a little dialogue box
on their screen asking them to accept or reject a requested name when
someone tries to create a character. If there's one GM/Guide online
and two people try to create at the same time, then the go through one
at a time. If the GM/GUide takes 45 seconds to approve the first, the
second is allowed through by timeout. If the GM/Guide ignores the
request, then both are allowed through by timeout. If both are
answered within 10 seconds then...well, they're either allowed in or
bounced, whichever the GM/Guide chooses. If no GM/guide is online, I'm
not quite sure whether the name sits for the timeout period or if it
just skips it and goes straight in when it passes the filter.
