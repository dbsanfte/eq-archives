In combat, no.

And its a bit of a blessing for the wrists of a resting bard.

But

Cantata
Amp (with a tic of cantata)
CCC
CCC  (with a tic of cantata)
CCC
Cantata
CCC
CCC  (with a tic of canata)
CCC
CCC  (with a tic of cantata)
Cantata

Is a lot more mana than
Amp
CCC (3 tic)
CCC (3 tic)
CCC (3 tic)
Amp

Plus its got the cantata HP regen.

Its also a lot more mana than

Cantata
Cantata
Cantata

which at least gives the HP regen, but totally ditches the
revised CCC, and since you can't amp it, loses amp effect and/or
epic singing boost effect.

If it stacks, then thats a different story, you -still- lose some
mana due to the fact that you can pulse CCC more often than 3
times in 3 tics, but as you sort of point out, in practice this
will mean you can do -more- during combat time, running
Cantata/CCC/Haste/Overhaste/Slowsnare as a 5 cycle twist,
currently I don't bother with CCC but use a DOT or something
generally, since its only a single pulse of CCC each twist, if
its a normal "duration" song then it will be three times as
useful in an active twist.

Here's the real kicker that makes this scream "nerf" though.  In
a group with more than one bard, you could get up to 5 bards
singing mana to one caster, pumping out 40+ amped pulses every 9
tics.  If its an "icon" buff that, like cantata, won't stack with
other bards, then the maximum output becomes 9 every 9 tics;
thats a huge drop in max bardic output.

Or put 4 bards with 2 casters, thats 64 amped pulses every 9
tics, versus 18 every 9 tics

Or put 3 bards with 3 casters for 72 amped pulses per 9 tics
versus 27 every 9 tics

Of course with only two bards and 4 casters you get back to 64
amped pulses every 9 tics verus 36 every 9 tics

And with one bard you see 40+ now and will see 45 if this goes
thru, so its actually an increase for a single bard in a group
(assuming he can only sing once per tic, and that he has to skip
the amp tic cause he's singing that instead... if it has a
duration you can -definately- stick amp in there without it
fading)
