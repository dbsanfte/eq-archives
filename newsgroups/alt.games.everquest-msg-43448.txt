You snipped the part where I said you can't get up during a game of chess and
expect to gain anything (in game) while away.  That was the main part of my
point.

No, sitting there hitting F8 every six minutes and /pet attack doesn't sound
very fun to me either.  Good thing I've never done it, and have no desire to
do it.  Hint: there are many other things to do that are nowhere near as
boring as this.

If you think going through 50+ levels of something you find disagreeable worth
it, go right ahead.  As for me, no, I would not play a necro for 59 levels no
matter how great the level 60 necro may be.

Ok, let me be clear on one point that may have been muddled so far: the
strongest thing I objected to in the original quote was the "...and by
actively playing it" part, he was saying it was silly for a game to expect you
to actively play it.  Umm, yeah.  The "amused at all times" part I'd of course
have to admit that there are the boring parts.  But the vast majority is fun,
and my playstyle caters to the fun stuff, not the boring as all sin sit in one
place camping ONE mob garbage.  Why so many people still insist on doing these
mind numbingly boring camps is beyond me (if they somehow enjoyed it, that's
one thing... but to do it and then complain about it boggles my mind).

Five minutes of counting up production values is actively doing something,
like breaking out a calculator to figure out your mana pool.  But in EQ, any
time of going AFK and gaining xp is too long to be away (solo, anyway--it's
possible to do that as part of a group, though your group members might not
appreciate it).

Well, for one, you should try to minimize downtime (camping a single 6 minute
easy blue spawn solo is not the way to do that).  However, I have a strong
suspicion *Verant* has a problem with you going away and levelling, and it
should be obvious to anyone who has played for more than a week that it was
NOT the way EQ was meant to be played.  And I hope they agree with me.

I'll say it flat out: I would consider this an exploit.  If not in the
bannable sense, in the "spirit of the game" sense.  It's a violation of the
way EQ is clearly designed to work.  Sure, it's Verant's fault if the
mechanism is in there to begin with, but I view it in the same way I view
other exploits: pretty damn cheesy.

> IS playing?

Well, no, I wouldn't really consider it playing.  At least, not playing a game
I would ever want to touch.

For the same reason I don't think xp should be available for 1pp per yellow
bubble at the nearest vendor.  The same reason Tumpy was finally removed as a
purchasable xp route (yes, Verant's fault but they finally fixed it).  The
same reason bad pathing and safe spots should not be exploited (and are
bannable offenses).  Etc. etc. etc.  Risk vs. reward and all that (there
really are sound reasons Absor and Abashi repeat that phrase regularly).

But as I said in my earlier post, if this is something only a small handful of
people are doing (because it's too inconvenient, or if there really is a risk
of death), I don't care if they fix it.  If it turns out lots of people are
doing this though?  I'd be the first to send Verant a screenshot and details
on what they were doing.
