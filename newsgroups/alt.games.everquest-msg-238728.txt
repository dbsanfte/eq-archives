i am considering buying everquest
imagine that i know nothing about the game, just that my lame brother said
that i should check it out
what would you tell me about the game:
how much does it cost?
what are your options?
at what level do you really feel like you are enjoying your investment?
how much time do you need to enjoy the game?
what kind of system do i need?
what characters are the best to play?
can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

really, just anything at all that comes to mind

thank you
