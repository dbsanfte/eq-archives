Face it. They don't really have to. The game is awesome and well worth
the time and effort, else it wouldn't rile you so. Sure, I wish patch
day ran more smoothly, but I am certain they don't refrain from buying
more *patch equipment* just to save a buck. We only face issues such
as this once or twice a year. Get over it.

I know, let's all whine until they spend mega bucks on equipment and
support personnel to the point where it is economically unfeasible to
keep EQ running. Then we'll see what real disappointment is like.

Better yet, take off as your *threat* implied.

Can I have your stuff?
