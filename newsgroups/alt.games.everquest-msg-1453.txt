Most of my journeys, and pick up groups, throughout my life were all
pleasant ones. Then i started to group with some friends that sent tells
on a daily basis. Things were great! Great experience no more looking
for groups, also a great leader who told us what to do and things worked
great.

One day while hunting in N. Karana for griffawns i made a mistake.
Instead of pulling a griffawn i pulled in "a griffawn". The group and i
tried to kill it, but to no avail. I heard others shout run to zone, and
only me and a cleric managed to zone safely. 2 monks and a ranger payed
for my mistake with their lives. i told them sorry, my mistake, and that
i was not careful. The 2 monks who are friends said that things like
this happen, and not to worry about it. But the ranger by the name of
Barchetta, spammed me with some harsh words saying i was a stupid fuck.
Now i know that i messed up. And believe me i felt bad enough letting my
party down, but to get spammed like that by a person that obviously cant
handle dying, was hartbreaking. After that incident i decided to make
the journey from Quenyos to freeport to maybe meet some others to team
up with. Next time i see Barchetta shes getting the finger!
