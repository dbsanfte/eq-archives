Lake of Ill Omen is a great place to go (assuming you have the Kunark 
expansion)...I waited until I hit 20 to make the journey, but you should 
still be fine at 19...

If you want to know how to get there, here is a post from a few days ago:

A few tips:

-If you go the safe way like I did, be very careful when crossing Firiona 
Vie...the spiders are a nightmare and will kill you really fast...you 
should get bound in FV also.

-Once you hit LOIO, head to the windmill in the southeast corner of the 
zone, thats where a lot of players meet up to group or just hang out, and 
when you get to the mid 20s, you can try your luck at the Sarnak Fort on 
the west side of the zone.

I think youll love LOIO; I'm averaging a level a night there, and you 
will make good money since things drop at least 1 pp.
