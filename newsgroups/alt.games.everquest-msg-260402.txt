This was a 'bug' by any definition. Hybrids should have taken a fair 
share, and levelled slower. That was the point of the penalty after 
all... to slow *them* down, not slow the groups they were with down.

The idea of balancing two classes on "I took 50% longer to get to level 
50, but once I get there I'm more powerful than a warrior" does work in 
theory. (and many rpg games), but yeah, in eq it was a bad idea.

It might have been more viable if a true multi-classing system was 
supported . Of course, then -everyone- would multi-class for the extra 
utility... and the actual range of characters becomes more generic as a 
result.

There's never an easy answer to that problem.

Boats should have had general supplies merchants on board, mini-games 
(good place to put the casino is on a ship), a banker (so you could do 
something useful like clean out / organize your bank...), someone 
selling rods and bait, etc etc

NPCs at the various docs should have told you when the next boat was 
arriving and departing. The boats should have moved faster.

But the -biggest- problem with boats was that they were buggy. Dropping 
people in the ocean after zoning, and other fun stuff like that.
