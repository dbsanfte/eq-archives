Hi,

Did anyone else receive a really old patch message when they went
to log on this morning?  Today is Saturday Sept. 29th, and I just
got an eqnews.txt file (patch message) that was dated around July
24th or so.

I remembered seeing that particular patch message quite some time
ago.  It was from quite an old patch.. did this happen to anyone
else?
