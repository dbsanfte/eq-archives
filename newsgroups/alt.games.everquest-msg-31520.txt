All the insults on that site dont bother me. The teeth one does though. Mainly
because it is untrue, for the most part, and its straight out of a fucking
movie. I wouldnt mind if it were an ongoing insult but i never heard it once
before austin powers. What if somebody decided to make a movie portraying the
brits as 'insert your insult here' and an entire nation believed it was a
truism. I can take a joke as well as the next man but when brit bashing is
discussed the teeth thing is now omnipresent and that fucks me off.
