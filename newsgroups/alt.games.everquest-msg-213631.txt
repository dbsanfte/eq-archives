There is essentially one in every starter city, plus one in a couple of
other locations, notably Firiona Vie, I think in The Overthere, definitely
in Shadowhaven and Plane of Knowledge and also at the Gnome dock in
Iceclad ocean. Multiple zone cities - The Kaladim Soulbinder is in a
little side room off the cavern with the warrior guild in (by the way out
North). The Freeport one is in East Freeport, the Neriak one is in the
outermost Neriak zone, Not sure on the Qeynos one....you should be able to
use the mapping feature to find these guys as maps are useable in newbie
zones and starting cities
