I quite agree with everything you said. For me the game ends at 50.
I love playing the low levels, I have a bunch of characters at various levels.
My 50+ characters are a pain to play. Have to almost have a raiding party
to do anything. Don't have a chanter in the party? Sorry can't go to dungeon
A or B. Don't have a Cleric? Can't do Dungeon C or D. Don't have a tank?
Sorry you gotta fight light blues. Only have 2 hours to play? Sorry can't go
on a plane raid.

I do like some aspects of the 50+ game like the AA skills being a nice edition.
