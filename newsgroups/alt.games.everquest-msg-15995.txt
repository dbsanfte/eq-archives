I did wonder about that.  That's a little disapointing.  Some people have
asked how much I hit for and are usually impressed when they find out how
much - even at my lowley level.

Brilliant strategy!  Thanks for the tip.  I guess I'm just too keep to see
those big damage messages.  I also thought of keeping my nukes back until
the battle has gone on for a bit and using them to finish it off - but I
can't help but feel a bit mean watching my fellow group members take a
beating but it has the added effect of giving me time to med while they
heal.
