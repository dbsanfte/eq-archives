No, you can't get to 60 in original EQ. You need any one of Kunark,
Velious or Luclin to get to 60. If all you have is original EQ you
can't get above 50. Without your account upgraded to any one of the
other ones there is no 51 - 60.

Luclin gives you alt advance, without luclin you won't get it.. or the
new models. Luclin also gives you the nexus which is a great way to
get around even to older areas of EQ like Dreadlands, Toxula (paineel,
warrens, stonebrunt), north karana, Greater fay and now even great
divide. For a non porter its the fastest way to travel just by being
bound near a spire or in the nexus area.

SO really at this point to enjoy the current highest benefits of EQ
you need at least Old EQ, Kunark (includes Old EQ, except new mini box
version) and Luclin. You need kunark to get your characters epic and
Luclin for alt advance (both get you to 60) You just may as well get
Velious while at it to also be able to get velious class (POG or
quest) armor. So you kind of need all of them for the most benefit.
