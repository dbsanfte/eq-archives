There's different flavors of cold, too... For example, London and Madrid 
are similarly cold in winter (Madrid's higher altitude compensating for 
its lower latitude), but the cold in Madrid is generally dry and crisp, 
whereas in London it's generally more damp and humid, and feels a lot 
more miserable.

In Los Angeles, of course, it's the air conditioning that kills you.
