"You are more powerful at level 30 than you are at level 65" - Thats what is
really stupid...!

The problem with EQ is generally that the NPCs are grossly overpowered
starting from around level 20... and it only gets worse as you level up, at
high end game the game balance is so fucked up that its generally not fun
and stupidly unbalanced.
