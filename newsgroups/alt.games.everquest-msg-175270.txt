Well Horus, without giving away too much (you'll either believe me or
you won't) you pretty much hit the nail on the head with most of the
projects SOE has attempted since VI was acquired.  Over ambitious was
the rule rather than the exception.  Planetside anyone?  Soverign?  I
can tell you that Soverign was completely restarted 3 times, almost
from ground up.  Know how many times EQ was restarted?  0, zero, nada,
zilch.

All the new games I have seen, including EQ2, are overhyped and put
too much weight on graphics.  The graphics part is just my opinion of
course but I love EQ because its design was great, not for the
graphics.  I have nothing against SOE except that I think they are
screwing up what should have been the best game line in history.  Brad
McQuaid and his team did an utterly fantastic job on EQ, but that team
is all but gone now.  Why?  Because SOE came in and started screwing
with the system.  A system that was proven.  Now they've decided to go
it on their own under Sigil Games.  Of course we have to wait and see
how it goes, but I'm betting they make history again.

But I digress.  It's potential was tremendous, but it's since been
lost.  Take it as you will.
