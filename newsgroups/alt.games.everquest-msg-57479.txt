You're mistaking her with Erollisi (although she isn't too Granola
either), but don't worry, it's a common mistake to make.

I was talking with Drywit when this happened. He was wandering around
PoG, he helped a little with corpses and the occasional buff, *never*
got a faction hit and suddenly things were chasing him. He went back
and things were still chasing him.

I know of an enchanter who's been to PoG and for some reason HAD to
die before they left. Don't know if that was for 'residual faction
hits' or what, I never got a chance to ask her and only read about it
on a messageboard post. (It didn't look like sarcasm...)
