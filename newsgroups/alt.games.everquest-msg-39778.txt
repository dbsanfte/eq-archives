Im giving everquest a break for at least 3 months. 
My new connection has rendered it unplayable and until I can afford to beef up
my machine and get me a cable modem im calling it a day.
Obviously I dont want to fork out for 3 months play that im not using but I
dont want to cancel the account because ill be back once i get my shit squared
away, so is there a way i can put my account on 'hold' or something? and not
lose my characters and have to buy the game all over again?
I would ring tech support but Im in the UK so it's not really an option, I've
e-mailed Verant but they haven't replied yet so can any of the most excellent
people who frequent this most excellent newsgroup afford me any most excellent
advice concerning my most bogus predicament?
