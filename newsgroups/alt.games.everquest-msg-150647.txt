First, you need to buy trader bag(s) from a vender inside the main building
of the bazaar.  Then you need to find an open spot under the awning
somewhere in the zone.  Once you find a spot to stand, hit your "control"
and "r" key together.  That will bring up your trader screen. You then can
select the item you want to sell (it has to be in your trader satchel you
bought from the vendor) and then set the price.  Be sure to hit "accept" AND
"set price" buttons once you decide on your price.  Once you have the price
set on all your items, you hit the "begin Trader" button. Now people can
browse and buy your items.

Its a good idea to type /bazaar and type in the name of items you are
intending to sell.  This will give you the list of current player vendors
and prices that the item is being currently sold for.  This helps you to
adjust your price to compete with the other sellers if you so desire.

Once more note, make sure you are using the newUI when you do this.  Some
people still use the old interface and the trader feature will not work with
it.

Hope this helps.
