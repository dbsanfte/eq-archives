Besides getting lost, no, probably not.  Make sure you're completely buffed
and if necros get root (I assume they do) that that's memmed.  Do they get
levitate?  You'll want that too, if it's an option.  You can do without it,
it's just a longer trip and more dangerous.

If you have friends I'd recommend one of them take you to Xalgoz.  Once
you're there you'll have no problem camping him.
