SneakyAmp are Joe Botts nice little winamp plugin, so you can control 
winamp with key commands while youre running other programs. If you just 
sit and work nomally, you just switch out to winamp and skib numbers and 
such, but since programs like EQ dont allow task switching, Sneakyamp 
are a great tool if you wanna listen to your mps3 instead of EQs normal 
music.
Getting so used to it that i use Sneakyamps way of control to control 
wimamp, even when im doing other things. Only thing i miss is Winamps 
search function, so you can find a number in the playlist and tell 
winamp to play that number next, without removing everything else from 
the play list.
