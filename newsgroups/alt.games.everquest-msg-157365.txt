My first naked run across Antonica.  Man, was that scary. I was taking
the trip to xfer some gear from my Monk to my wife's new cleric, Tiru. I
think I was level nine or ten. No FD, no good skills. Put the stuff in
the bank and made the run from Qeynos to FP and the boat to BB and then
to Kalidim.

No friends in the game at the time to speak of, no guild, just some maps
printed out from eqatlas. No SoW, no nothing. Made the run naked and it
was heartstopping the whole way.

Ahhh... good times.
