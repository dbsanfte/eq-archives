Well, it was a combination:

1) The above it true...he was so big that even with the clip plane out, you
couldn't
    see all of him if nearby.
2) The main reason was his huge size messed up his pathing...horribly.
    He would often be seen in the AIR of Lake Rathe, flying around and
aggroing
    people/mobs/anything that moved from 100 feet up.
