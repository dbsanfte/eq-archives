The Bazaar is rather complicated to render, probably due mostly to all the
players; I suspect most any engine would
have similar problems; each player gets to choose their own look, which
includes a mishmash of showable items/armor. In the bazaar, if you are at one of
the banks, and face away from the traders, the frame rate improves noticeably.
(Always use the trader-facing side of the bank.)

Has anyone else *not* noticed similar problems with other multi-player games
when the players get to chose their own look and number of players in view
is large?
