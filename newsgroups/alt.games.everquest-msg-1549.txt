You will not evade me, Dilettante <del@gaffe.demon.co.uk>:

>[1] Evade is due for another nerf. Unbelievable.

Yes and no. It's being adjusted for the fact that the mobs have longer
hate lists. See the difference between being sent to the bottom of a
10 player hate list and the bottom of a 30 player hate list on a raid
with 20 people whereof some aren't even directly touching the mob?
(No clue how long the hate lists really were/are, just making up
numbers for the sake of this example.)
The way I understood it, the change means that instead of being dumped
to the bottom of hate list, the evading rogue is dumped to number 10
on the hatelist. There will still be 9 others for the mob to beat up
before returning attention to you, but it won't go after the casters
medding for heals before it goes after you.

(Oh, and the 7 minute recast-on-same-person delay on Donal's BP might
be a little more than needed, but that 'nerf' isn't really a disaster
either compared to what the BP could do, which makes pre-nerf druid
snare dot kiting pale in comparison...)
