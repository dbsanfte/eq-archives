Playing around in Kael on my ogre mule while a friend's guild was prepping
for Vindi I was confusing them by suiciding into Vindi, which causes him to
shout something about "your kind not defiling the temple of Zek".

Which leads me to ask, what other things shout like that when they kill
someone, not just the "CORPSEATTOPOFAGROLIST" DT shout that some stuff does,
but things like Vindi's "don't defile the temple" or Gorenaire's "don't defy
Veeshan" message?

Yeah, I basically just want to sneak a suicidal newbie into zones with this
kind of thing and agro them.
