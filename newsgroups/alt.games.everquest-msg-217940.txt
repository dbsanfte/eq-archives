    It has to be well-built. You need someone slowing, and someone that can
be trusted to cc stuff. You also need a plan for when mobs go into run mode
(snare, stuns etc.). It could be that you're so used to doing things "the
right way" that you don't even count this as a requirement.

    Put a timer on it and people care about time. If there was a leaderboard
with XP gained / time /played I bet XP sessions would be nice and tense,
too. People refuse collections because they're currently poorly tuned.

    Do your groups come with buffs from PoK, or do you only have buffs that
the group can cast? Last night I did an all-guild group, WAR CLR ROG RNG BRD
ROG (someone's 65 twink with Ragebringer main hand). From the start of the
adventure to the end, I slowly went from FM to 20m with C5 and SD for the
first half of the adventure. I'd hate to think how people with lower mana
regen and pools would do, although we were rushing to try and set a new
Assassination time record for two of the group members (21 minutes, their
record was 19).

    Do more Guk. Guk has a fair number of enchanter mobs, and a few
necromancers. Of course, if you have graphics on you can see exactly what
they're trying to cast and trivially interrupt them with a stun, so casters
might not provide the challenge you want. You also are being fairly
cautious, I bet. At one point last night the warrior shot an arrow into a
room (Pacification, WTF is that?) and got eight mobs. He tanked two, rogue
tanked one, bard got the rest mezzed after I offtanked them all to start.
That was a wee bit dicey. I used 50m at the start of that before medding up
to 80m by the end, and at one point both the warrior and myself were below
30 health (and I don't have Divine Arbitration).

    Or, like last night, the roamers ignore you. The warrior was standing at
a four-way intersection in Rujark, facing North about to pull the two mobs
in the alcove there, when a slave stalker goes tearing past him heading East
to West. It ran behind him, so he had no clue what had happened, but the
rest of us were all "WTF?" No, it didn't aggro - it ran by too fast to aggro
on the warrior. Funniest thing I ever saw, especially with the warrior
turning in circles trying to figure out what we'd seen.

    Some people have figured out that yes, you can AoE an entire dungeon in
a few pulls. They have loads of fun. One of our guild wizards was abandoned
in a dungeon by a group that figured they couldn't do it. He quadded his way
to the win.

    Now, if you wanted a challenge you'd take a difficult adventure instead
of a normal adventure. Those seem to be the same as a normal adventure from
one average level tier up, so if you were in the level 60 hard it would be
like the level 65 normal (mobs hitting max 375 or so). But at this stage
most people are more interested in racking up points to get phat lewts than
actually challenging themselves.
