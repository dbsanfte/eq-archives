AC is probably the better game, but if a good magic system is important to you
then your game is EQ.  I'd be playing AC except that the magic system is a
total botch job; it's magic designed by dull bureaucrats.  Having spent time
talking to the Turbine folks earlier this year, I have high hopes for AC2.

AC graphics are not as good as EQ but that quickly becomes insignificant.  Lag
is almost non-existant, btw.
