While testing pet weapon damage in the tutorial, I got interested in the 
slaves.

Turns out, as I knew, that they will follow you around if you agree to 
[escort] them to safety ,and that they will fight for you in the meantime.

Here are several things I didn't know though.

One, you can have one and a pet.

But Two, you cannot summon a new pet if you have one.

Three, you can remove the quest and they stay with you.

But Four, even if you remove the quest you still can't summon a new pet.

Five, only one slave will follow you, ask another and it will say that 
its too dangerous.

Six, if your current slave dies, you can't get a new one, for reason Five.

Seven, if you remove the quest, then you can get a new slave.

Eight, (and here it gets crazy) you can do this even if your current 
slave hasn't died, see Three.

Nine, there are Four slaves available... and you can have all four.

Ten, you, your pet, if you're a pet class, plus four slaves = ARMY OF ONE

Eleven (yes, this one goes to eleven) while under your protection, you 
can hand the slaves a weapon, and they will use it.  Their native high 
end damage is about 8, so giving them a rusty two hander doubles their 
damage output.  They do not, however, dual wield.


I'm going to try this as a level two halfing rogue.  I won't have a pet 
of my own, but hide and sneak should get me the fearsome foursome!
