[long ramble, please ignore if easily bored]

I'm finally out of my rut, and out of level 35 to boot.

It is truly amazing that, with the sheer number of zones in Norrath, I
had so much trouble finding a decent place to hunt. Everyone
recommended the Overthere but I've never liked that zone. I tried
hunting in the Karanas: avocets (still), griffons, the occasional
cyclops. I was really too high for those areas. Tizmaks in GD gave
lousy loot and tiny amounts of xp. Kodiaks in GD seem a bit much for
me (esp. with a 50 cha...forget charm animal).

So I crumbled to the pressure and tried quadkiting cougars. 

Wow. Great xp, lots of excitement, abysmal loot (unless you get an
earring). On my first attempt I killed 3 and got an earring. I killed
a group of 2 and learned not to run along slopes as the mobs get
separated.

On my third attempt I snared 2, and 2 more aggroed onto me. I got
clawed up but managed to snare them. With a bit of maneuvering I got
them grouped together. I cast Lighting Strike: 4 hits! My first actual
quad! I cast 2 more lightning strikes and watched the damage pile up.
This was going to work! YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED.

NOOO!!! My second linkdeath, and with 2 blues to go to 36. Sigh. I
bound myself in Thurg during the Tizmak hunt, so I popped out to sow
myself before porting to Iceclad. Oh look, a 56 cleric. I was VEEERY
polite. Minutes later I had a full xp rez. The cleric asked only to be
ported to NK and refused a donation.

I dinged 36 shortly thereafter. (Finally!)

I suspect I'll be in Iceclad until level 42 or so, quadding cougars
and dire wolves. It's almost too bad the xp is so darn good; it's
almost impossible to pass up. 

(And in case you're wondering, at least half my time is spent doing
guild stuff. The xp is minute, but it's loads of fun.)

Maybe at 36 I can finally solo my first hill giant. I came THIS close
to doing it at 35... (6 stupid resists in a row...and then the ensnare
ran out...)
