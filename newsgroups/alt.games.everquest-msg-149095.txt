Denying be access because of the sheer fact they don't like me is
against the law if it's open to the public which it is. If I had
broken some rule then that would be different, otherwise I could take
them to court and ram a monkey wrench up their ass sueing them all
which ways. I or anyone else does have the right to pay to play the
game unless they break a rule on the EULA or sony makes it look like
they do, otherwise refusing access would be very illegal.
