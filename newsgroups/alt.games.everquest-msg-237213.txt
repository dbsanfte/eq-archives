No argument there. But you only went so far as to say that "most"
recite it. You have to go all the way and say "everybody without
exception" merely recite it. Otherwise you must concede that there is
somone who really does 'feel it". 

Proof by counter example requires a single instance, one person who
'feels it'. As long as your willing to concede that it is a prayer,
and someone out there 'feels it' when they utter it, then the proof
stands. :)
