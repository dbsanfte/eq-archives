Not quite.

French Wine Coca (the predecessor to Coca-Cola, was only moderately 
succesful, and was indeed an imitation of Vin Mariani (a Bordeaux 
steeped in coca leaves - alcohol & cocain) which was VERY successful and 
very well marketed.

But Pemberton further 'improved' it by adding the Kola extract 
(caffeine) and created the successor Coca-Cola in the early 1880s.

Since then they swapped sugar water for alcohol (to circumvent looming 
prohibition in 1886), de-cocainizing the coca (circa 1901), and adding 
gas a while later.

Even Coca-Cola a century ago had very little in common with Vin 
Mariani... One lousy common ingredient and even that wasn't the same 
(decocainized coca leaves vs straight coca leaf).
