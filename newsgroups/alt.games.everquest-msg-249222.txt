	It didn't for me.

	Here's the short story of my second experience as a new EQ player.

	I'd had an AOL account for many years, but finally canceled it
in a fit of rage when they disabled it for posting spam in a chat room.
The spam was a link to an HP printer driver for someone I was chatting with,
but AOL chose to consider ANY non aol link "commercial spam" and a bannable
offense.  The next day I was bemoaning the loss of my favorite virtual
place to a friend who was a long time EQ player.  She said I needed to
try EQ again.

	I could have let her power me up to a high enough level to group
with her.  I could have accepted enough equipment to make me invincible to
any orc in Gfay.  But I didn't :-)  because I knew it would ruin the game...
I explored, quested, and generally had a blast running around (so to speak,
I of course DID use the stones :-) and unlike the first time was able to
do this in 2 hour chunks.  I took about a year to hit 60 and was privately
pleased when the friend who reintroduced me to EQ told me that I'd seen more
of Norrath than she had because mostly she just went where her guild went.

	I'm telling you this to try and explain why I don't think the 
changes NEED to remove the magic (they do make it easier to do so if you
want to though) and why I think they may really help attract new players,
especially people who, well, need a more...condensed?...efficient? :-)...
smaller world.
