I do love this story too. Here is a link to it 
http://users.ev1.net/~dhwave/everquest/charm1.html

  I always like to read funny stories about people's experiences in the 
game. Here's one of mine:

I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed a 
young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though it 
looked like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I decided to 
help the guy out.

I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to 
type: "I'm mesmerizing the lion for you." I got as far as: "I'm " when I 
remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of Effect 
mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC enchantress.

Gulp.

My movement keys are mapped to "w a s d" so I frantically stabbed at my 
keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell.

I forgot that I was in typing mode.

The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she promptly 
charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying to *save*. I 
watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife flailing like a 
crazed sushi chef, chased the little guy down and stabbed him to death.

I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a 
nice weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed 
when I told him what happened. He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. 
One minute he was fighting a lion, the next minute a strange gnome 
appeared out of NOWHERE, announced: "I'm wwwaaaddd", then sliced him up 
like Freddy Krueger. [sigh]
