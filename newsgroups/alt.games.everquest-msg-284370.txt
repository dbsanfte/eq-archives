I can't believe I'm bringing this up again, but my understanding of how 
haste works has again been questioned, and I thought I'd bring it up 
here and see if I've got something wrong.

Here's how I think it works;

There are several sources of haste; item haste, buff haste, song haste 
and song overhaste, and clicky item haste.

Several of these will "stack" with each other, and the total haste is 
capped at a limit based on your level.  One, song overhaste, stacks and 
will allow you to excede your cap.

Here, then, is the stacking as I understand it:

Item haste; you get only the best haste % from the various items you 
wear, they do not stack to produce a better haste (ie wearing a 20 haste 
and a 21 haste means you have 21 haste, not 41 haste)

Spell haste; again you get only the best haste % from various haste 
buffs you may have on, even though in some cases you can have more than 
one haste buff simultaneously (and will see other effects like stat 
boost from both).  Spell haste stacks with item haste to give total 
haste up to the cap.

Song haste; this is the bone of contention: I believe that most haste 
songs count as spell haste, and stack with spell haste buffs just as any 
other spell haste buffs, which is to say that only the best haste % 
counts, they do not add.  SO its song haste or spell haste, whichever is 
better, plus item haste, to the limit of the cap.

Song overhaste is another matter, it stacks with item and spell/song 
haste, and is not limited by the cap:
Max of {(item + spell/song), cap] + overhaste

Clicky item haste produces either spell/song haste buff, or overhaste 
buff, those buffs work the same as above.

Why bring this up?  Because I've been grouping with quite a few new 
bards on the Combine server who have been playing their haste songs 
despite the group being hasted by shaman or enchanter.  When I point out 
in tells that they'd probably benefit the party more playing something 
else, or perhaps their self only haste which might be better than the 
cast haste they are wearing, they all claim their song stacks with the 
cast haste.

A few are willing to check into it further, but some insist that I'm 
wrong and thats the end to it.  One has gone so far as  to tell me he's 
running a parser and can see that he does more DPS with both spell haste 
and song haste than he does with either alone.

To be specific, at this point we had Alacrity
which is pure haste, 40%
and the bard was singing Vilia's Verses of Celerity
which is 20% haste, and something like 30 agility and 6 AC

At 52 my cap is well above 20, 40, or even 60, I have no haste item.

It is my belief that without the shaman buff my haste would be 20, with 
just the shaman buff and no song my haste would be 40, and with both, my 
haste would STILL be 40 however I'd also get the agility and AC boost.

Can anyone out there test this with a parser?

And for that matter, point me towards a good parser for myself; I feel 
like I'm slacking off a bit in not doing some comparisons to see things 
like whether I'm doing more damage with my 2hs or with my 1hb and 
constant bashing, etc.
