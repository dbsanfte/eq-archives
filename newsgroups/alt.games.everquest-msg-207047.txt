Lot of this goes on.

We are nearly Elemental plane flagged, jsut some annoying back flags to get
and Sol Ro to defeat. For a long time the two "uber" guilds have been ahead
in the elementals but have got nowhere far because one of them has only 40
members and struggle on the higher end encounters (always admired the fact
that they own so much with 40 but they are universally hated as they are
scumbags) and the other guild (an alliance of 3) has been losing members due
to boredom left right and centre. This alliance came to us and offered us a
deal. We back flag their new recruits and when they do a backflag then our
members can tag along PROVIDING that we had already beat the encounter
previously. No win situation for us 100% gain for them. So we declined. One
of these people need a lot of backflags. We went to kill behemoth for 3
recent recruits and 2 slackers to complete their flag chain, alliance member
whined at every officer about getting a flag and then the fried of his in
the guild spent an hour ranting at different officers about it and deguilded
himself. He on Euro time and has no where to go.
