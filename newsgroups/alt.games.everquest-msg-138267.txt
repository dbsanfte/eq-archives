Same here, I had dialup for quite some time, connected at 24k, was a great
connection for EQ.  When it started having problems, I looked into
alternatives for connecting, I did not blame Verant.  The only reason I have
broadband now is that it actually ended up being cheaper for me.  Both my
wife and I are online at the same time, so we needed two dialup accounts,
and a second phone line.  With my wireless broadband, we need one account,
one router, two emails (small extra fee for that), and only one phone line.
Saves us about $15 a month.
