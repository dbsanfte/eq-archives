Yeah, the thing is, if you don't use DOTs you can use a level 14 cleric to
rezz.

And yes, I know that some are reading this and thinking "NO!! Don't spread
that myth, you CANNOT lose experience in the Arena, and they fixed that DOT
thing YEARS ago."  I'm not a regular here anymore but I used to be and many
old-timers know me.  And this I say:  Less than 2 months ago I died to a dot
in Arena and lost experience.
