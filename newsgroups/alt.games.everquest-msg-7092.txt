These were nerfed to have more hit points some time ago because too many
people were killing them. I believe where the mechanics spawn the guards and
clockworks are far enough away that they won't aggro--the trick was not to
let the mechanic run toward them and aggro them.

With the nerf there are probably better places for an evil PC to hunt. Druids,
Treants, Barbarians, and Humans in the Karanas are probably a good bet.
