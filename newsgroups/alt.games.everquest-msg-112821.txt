Everyone seems to be steering you away from DL, but other than
the idiots, which you can mostly avoid by turning off /ooc and /shout
if they annoy you too much, I found it a great place to level.
My Paladin did 45-50 there quite quickly.

The idiots are there for the same reason you'd be -- easy, safe
exp, and of all the zones you could do 45-50 in, it's by far
the one where you'll spend the least time looking for a group.
There are *always* multiple pick-up groups on the north wall
of the Karnor's building, and they're always having members
leave to bank or whatever, which means they're very often
looking for fill-in replacements.

Other than that, though, I'd also suggest Lower Guk.  From
30-ish (where LGuk becomes feasible) to 57 or so (at which
time finding enough blue cons becomes a problem), Lower Guk
(dead side) seems specifically designed for Paladins.  I
wish I had spent more time there, personally.
