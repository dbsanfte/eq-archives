I'm saying that the newbie and mid level zones are too bloody empty as it is
now, to shut anyone off from them. I'm saying that the fact that the newbie
zones are empty shows that there are very few A. true newbies left and B. that
it is a waste of resources to preserve zones for a vanishing class.

I'm also arguing that since the newbie loot eventually becomes worthless, anyone
should be able to farm it. If some 60 wants to go farm a FBR when nobody wears
them anymore, what's the bloody harm?

>And if a high level player wanted to start farming that zone ("Hey, I pays

>azz.  Who gives a SHIT if you'd get expo, and theses bitzes were green to me
>20 levels ago!  I PAY $10/MO, THEREFORE I AM A G0D SO FUCK OFF") then that

Sure, but how often does this happen? The fact the zones are empty implies to me
that it doesn't happen as often as some people whine it does.
