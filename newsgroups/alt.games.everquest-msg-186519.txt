From the shadows, the mysterious Khosh <test@test.com> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

No context was lost. It is not a given that the point for future games
has to be to advance at anything.

You tread softly towards what's called the dreaded mmorpg treadmill.
The push to advance.

Red herring. The original EQ has never been suggested as the way to
keep things. Again, there was more choice than "do this or do
nothing".

The only thing snipped was that you said all advancement in EQ was
numerical. That was not part of anything I answered, it was neither
denied nor relevant.
