I have a similar card except it's 4X AGP, and it's solid, and with the exception of the bazaar,
quite smooth in every zone.  Ok, some zones are a little smoother than others, but
as a bard, being very sensitive to frame rate problems, it's been a great card.

It's looking like I won't need another upgrade till the end of the EQ as a game.  I just don't
see SOE doing another Luclin-like upgrade of system requirements to play.  That was quite
a fiasco that I think they'd rather not repeat.
