There is nothing like that in the game, except the /note command, which is
pretty useless because you cant access it in-game.
What I do is use one of my social pages for note-storage. Create a new
social, put in the quest/location/mob/whatever details, and there you have a
reasonably large-capacity notebook.
I personally like to put them in as emotes, ": knows that he needs the gypsy
lute for the lambent BP".
Anyway I hope you find this technique useful.
