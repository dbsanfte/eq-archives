I have been PLing a wizzie with my main cleric lately. What I've 
generally done is buy a kei for the wizzie then pull/root mobs with 
cleric and let wizzie nuke them down.

Anyway, up to about 24 paludal caverns is very good exp. Phlargs first, 
then later on bandits.

After that I went to Sol A, set up camp in that small open space just 
past window room, where there is a door (loc n580,n550 I think, number 
13 on eqatlas map). Same deal there, pull/root with cleric, nuke with 
wizzie.. Sometimes if wiz was low mana I'd finish mobs off with cleric 
too while wiz meds.

Last night I went from 1/3 into 32 to 34 in about 2 hours. At 33 there 
are some green/light blue but not enough to make a big difference. At 34 
yet another type of gobbie (don't remember which, fire goblin perhaps?) 
turned light blue so I'm going someplace else. Lguk I think might be good.
