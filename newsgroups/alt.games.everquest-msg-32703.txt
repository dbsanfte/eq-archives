Well, add one to the list - finally got my Paw of Opolla the other
night, putting me at 204 WIS, so I can start swapping stuff out for mana
and resist gear. After getting all the rings, I waited about 30 min in
the Qeynos sewers for Vin Moltor to spawn, gave him his stupid pie and 3
bottles of Khalish, and promptly *didn't* get the Paw container. Maybe I
accidentally stacked something, or it should have been a rat-meat not a
rat-ear pie, or something.

I was out of mana from nuking every green in sight with huge amounts of
overkill (it's large rats like you who've ruined your own sewers, you'll
not ruin mine! Take this 250pt Fury of the air!). I didn't think I'd
need to actually fight Vin, so I was wasting mana like crazy.

Well, I didn't have any spare khalish on me to try again so I thought,
'I guess I'll just have to kill him for his Paw after all and take a
faction hit'. He was green to me, shouldn't be any problem. Cue little
alcoholic beggar-guy ninja kicking me for 45pts a time. Meleeing would
have been a close run thing, so I rooted him with a (thankfully
mana-free) root from my Tunare symbol and sat down until I'd medded
enough mana for a DoT. When it wore off, I closed in to finish him off
with melee, got him to turn and run (with me at 2 bubbles of health),
and...   went linkdead!!! AAARGH!!!

Couldn't log back in until I'd tried a couple of times, given up and
rebooted my PC. Luckily he hadn't slaughtered me in my absence and was
still up (though now at full health). I was expecting to have finished
him off in LD-NPC mode and made his corpse poof. So I tried again, got
the container, put the four rings in it and made my Paw. Now I look like
a proper druid - no weapon (I'm not a tank!)

You won't be getting this at your level without a lot of help though.
You could maybe gank Gynok Moltor in Befallen for the platinum ring at
25 or so, but you'll be swarmed in the fungus room in Upper Guk while
trying to camp the fungus mutant for the weed for the gold ring. It may
be doable in a full group at that level, but the mutant has a nasty
stun-poison. The mutant also drops a mildew for the copper ring (which
you may have already got from Gynok if he didn't drop the plat one), and
faerix spores for the silver ring. Its much easier to get the silver
ring from Blackburrow though - it's a ground  spawn, once each EQ day,
in the bottom of the razorgill pool in blackburrow. So slap on enduring
breath, mem an AoE nuke, and jump into the big hole at the top of
blackburrow, nuke all the fish if they're bothering you, and pick up the
thing that looks like a bag on the floor of the pool.
