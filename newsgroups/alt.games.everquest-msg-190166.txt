When he say /shout for help he doesnt mean ...

/shout "Help this orc is killing me"

This will only get you laughed at or at worst insulted ... if you are in a
life threatening postion use the /yell (or /y for short) command, this sends
out a scream for help to everyone in your local area AND gives your rough
location.

If you really must use the /shout command to get help with a mob try and be
as infomative as possible i.e /shout PLEASE HELP ME ! I'm being overwhelmed
by an Orc pawn at the druid rings !

I have a help hotkey for most my chars that reads something like

/yell
/say I'm too young and stunning to die!
/yell
/say Ooooh I'm feeling faint!
