I don't understand why they can actually say the 'Healhappy' and
'Treehugger' are ok last names but 'Neverlevels' isn't.  A friend of mine
had his name taken away but I thought it was kind of nice and different.  In
the same vein as Treehugger, it's a description of the character.  On the
other hand, I completely understand why they changed 'Rodetheshortbus', it
was funny while it lasted tho.
