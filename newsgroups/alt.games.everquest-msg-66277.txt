There is one fact everyone is overlooking.  The reason that so many
people are SO angry about their recent troubles playing EQ, is the the
game is so very enjoyable. Sony/Verant have produced a product so
entertaining that is has been afectionately termed "EverCrack" because
of people's obsession with it.

So, I ask you, why are you so angry about their OBVIOUS strides toward
making it EVEN BETTER?  This will not take forever and is without a
doubt the right thing for them to do.  Get over it and show a little
patience.  Anything worth having is worth waiting for, right?

Don't forget that IT IS ONLY A GAME.  If you don't like it, don't
play. Cancel your account.  Go play DAoC or AO or something if this is
such a terrible thing.

You CAN'T though, can you.  Yes, it is THAT good and, for the minority
that is still having difficulty (and you ARE the minority - rest
assured), it is WELL worth the wait.

See you all in Norrath!
