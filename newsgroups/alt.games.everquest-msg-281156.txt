heh... thanks... I should have tried that.

I'd actually phoned every single eb (like 6 of them) within a few miles 
of here, and they all said it was 'unavailable or discontinued'. Go 
customer service! (Sorry, EB really annoys me... and the sad part is 
they seem to be about as good as it gets.) Yes, i realize the website is 
run essentially as a separate company but still...

The most annoying thing about ebgames.com is the pricing.

I mean, I can buy Depths of Darkhollow at ebgames.com for 29.99 US... or 
I can buy it at amazon.ca for 29.99 CAD. Similiarly I can buy Depths of 
Darkhollow at ebgames.com for 29.99 US... or I can buy it off the shelf 
at the local ebgames for 29.99 CAD.

I have yet to buy anything from ebgames.com for my PC, my consoles, or 
anything because of it. So... I'm still holding out for a Canadian 
outlet, or even a US outlet that doesn't have a candian presnese they 
aren't busy screwing... but thanks again for the ebgames.com tip, at 
least I have an option now, if nothing else turns up.
