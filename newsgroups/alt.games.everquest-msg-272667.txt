    What Davian said. The group XP ZEM nerf was supposed to mostly hit the 
PoP zones, since the large ZEMs there would have allowed players to level at 
a fantastic pace. Nerfing places like Lower Guk was unnecessary, especially 
given that the zone greens out entirely before the really long levels of 
55+. 20% reduction in solo XP across the board, in a game where low numbers 
of players at lower levels is a problem? Not wise.
