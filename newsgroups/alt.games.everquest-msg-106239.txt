Well, mainly because it allows you access to the rest of your computer
while you're playing EQ, and it makes it possible to run two
characters from one computer.  Quite a few people play EQ while also
attempting to do other things.  If they want to read email, browse the
web, or debug their latest program while they med, EQW makes it much
easier.  It also makes running a port-mule/rez-mule possible with a
single computer.
It doesn't affect gameplay one bit more than having a second computer
in any of the listed cases.

No, that is the claimed reason that Verant didn't allow alt-tabbing
out of the game.  Guess what, it didn't stop some of the macros and
cheats, so Verant moved almost every interesting and/or exploitable
function server-side instead.  
Running EQW gives exactly no benefit beyond that which you can gain by
running a second computer.  In fact Verant recently said that EQW was
acceptable, though the way the questions were asked certainly appeared
leading to me.
I really, really suspect that you are confusing EQW with ShowEQ.  They
are entirely different programs, with entirely different purposes, and
are deal with in an entirely different manner by Verant.
Do you consider programable joysticks to be bannable?   They have a
MUCH bigger effect on gameplay than EQW does, and can allow
functionality that you can't get with a second computer (unless the
second computer has a Lego Mindstorm you program it to hit the buttons
for you).
