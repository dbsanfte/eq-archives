No matter what, people are going to tell you their guild is the best.
Guild-pushers are the EQuivalent of used car salesmen in my opinion.  Yes,
I'm in one, but to tell you the truth it (or none of the others I've
belonged to) are really nothing more than yet another annoying chat channel
blazing across my screen.
I join a guild.  Some "higher" guild members eventually start arguing and
guild seems to disband or split.  I bail.
Fickle, yes, but this is a game to me and if I want to hear snivelling I'll
go to work or have a discussion with the wife thank you very much.  Oh, some
people take you leaving a guild as a personal attack.  Just don't get a
complex over it.
However...I've met some decent people in the few guilds I've been in.  It's
a little easier to ask a stupid question to your guild than to /shout or
/ooc in a zone.  The atmosphere is a little more forgiving.
So if you're asking about whether-or-not to join a guild, my opinion is to
go for it.  You like EQ, well it's just a little EQ club so why not.  Just
don't get too attached to your guild is all I can say.  They don't seem to
last IMO.

Good luck!

Off to slay giants,
Sean...
