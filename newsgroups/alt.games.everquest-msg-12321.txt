> What were the earrings?

Damned if I know.  My problem is that being a rather honest person, I happen
to think I have WAY more money than a second level character should have,
and am starting to regret accepting the things.

Mind you, I had no problem accepting a Kodiak claw from this high elf woman
standing outside of Freeport.  I had asked her where I could buy food, she
told me I was cute, and gave me the claws.  Neat looking weapon.

So I'm a hypocrite.  Mind you, the claws are worth a heck of a lot less than
the earrings were...

ah well...  I think I'll just work for my stuff from now on, maybe donate
the money bit by bit to some helpless newbie...  Who knows.

Thanks for listening, people.
