Can anyone explain to me how completely embarrassing this little twerp and
forcing him to post replies that I can only read through other posters
constitutes having a nervous breakdown? Does this make sense to ANYBODY
here? Or is it some gradeschool taunt that Abenger is using for the
umpteenth time because he's too fucking stupid to think of anything somewhat
intelligible to say? Make up some more lies Abenger...and when you run out
of lies about yourself...by all means...start making them up about others.

Eventually everyone here will see what I'm talking about when you move onto
your next NG and start making up stories about all the people here telling
them that so and so was a convicted rapist and you have all the evidence to
prove it but the secret government forces of internet rapists united have
your hands tied to your keyboard and the only three letters you can type
are...

DUHHHHHH...
