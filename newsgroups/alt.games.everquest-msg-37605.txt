Well, if its the druid who's just been rezzed and they said to the cleric
"Please come rez me, I'll give you a ride over and pay" and then they demanded
the payment, or some of it, back for the ride back I'd be pissed as
a cleric.

While not explicitly stated that'd seem a pretty blatent breach of the
terms offered for the rez.

Whats the big deal? I pay clerics for Rezzes sometimes. I pay druids for
ports some times. Its their time, they're on to play, its their call.

A lot of the time I get payments refused too.
