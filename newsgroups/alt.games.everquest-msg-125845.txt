He may be talking about me.. I have an over 50 monk and I have sometimes not
paid for a res (but only if I had nothing on me).
There are not always banks near bind points... If I die, I have to run thru
multiple zones to get back to corpse or to get to bank.  If offered
a res, sometimes I only have thanks to give (monks have severe weight
restrictions and don't carry 50 pp around with them just in case).

I also run a cleric and am happy to offer a res for with or without donation
to those who ask (politely).
