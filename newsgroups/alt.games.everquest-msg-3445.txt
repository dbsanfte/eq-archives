At how much of a loss though?  Are you saying that you hope he brings it
down completely?  Because, unless the guy makes a lot of money and has
nothing to spend it on, this is probably more expensive than maintaining any
"casual" (non-rich man) hobby I can think of.

Would someone with website experience toss out some guestimations on how
much his website is probably costing him each month?

Honestly, Verant is probably glad to see a map site up as good as his...it
means no one will be bitching at THEM for maps.  If the guy who runs the
website didn't contact Verant for financial help, maybe he should (just
remember not to hold yer breath)...he's doing them as much of a favor as
he's doing us.

But no, it's extremely unlikely that I'll pay to go to a website as
organized as his and download maps...I'm paying for my 2 accounts and the
one for my brother whose wife is spending them into bankruptcy (the fault is
at least half his, of course...he's not strong enough to take the checkbook
and cards from her).  I don't need yet another EQ bill...twenty a month is
plenty, thankyouverymuch.
