Look, you moron, only you can decide what you should play. Or how. I can't
play that whatever for you, and what I like, you may not. So while I enjoy
playing a necro, and used to love my cleric, that doesn't mean you will
enjoy it. So asking us to tell you what to play is like inviting us over to
redecorate your house to our taste. You didn't think leopard prints would go
with glow in the dark paint, now did ya? That's sort of the effect of me
telling you what to play.

If you can't find anything like a race or a class that you prefer, perhaps
you should try another game?

Or you could say what about each you *did* like, and didn't like, and maybe
we can gauge your taste and advise from there.
