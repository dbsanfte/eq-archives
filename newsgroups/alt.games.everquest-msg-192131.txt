It seems that the new patch starts EQ in a window. Unfrotunately it
also completely kills the game in winex 2.2.1. The Winex3 pre-release
version does work, I've got it running now. Try deleteing your
eqclient.ini file and resetting your graphics options. I've noticed a
bit of mouse lag in this version but it's playable.
