It was a pain for me to find decent int and mana items for the first 20
levels or so. Aside from Cubert there isn't a good way to get items
yourself. What I did was simply buying the jewelcrafted items from players
and upgrade whenever I had a bit of cash left after a spellround.

I know the first drop I ever had which I could use for int was the book and
robe from Najena around lvl 25-30. Never bothered for Cubert because it was
at the other end of the world (at least it seemed like that at that time :).

I read that luclin brought a lot more items for the lower levels with just
+1 int and +5 mana and the like. I'd suggest to do a nice search on
allakhazam and see what drops in zones like Paladul and Shadeweavers.
