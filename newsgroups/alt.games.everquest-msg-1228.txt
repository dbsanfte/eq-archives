This is either incorrect or I found a bug in the program this week. My
alt wizard was in Everfrost, and I planned to stay for a while.  Out by
Bandl's station I /ooc'd for anyone doing binds for donations.  A caster
came up and said, "Ok, but we have to go to Halas to do it."  I replied,
"No, that's ok. I'm a wizard. We can just do it here."
  He shrugged and gave it a try, and we both got a message saying that
it had failed to bind me to the area.  We ran back and zoned into Halas
and he was able to bind me with no problem.
  If this is a bug, please let me know so I can report it.  I would like
to get bound right outside the door to Blackburrow in QH rather than the
gates of Qeynos if that's possible for the next couple levels with my
wiz.
