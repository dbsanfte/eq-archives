After god knows how many years of trying to explain it to people who
are determined not to listen in the first place, its gotten to the
point where time is better spent flaming the shit out of them than
trying to walk Yet Another Topposting &%#@* through why they are
wrong. There might be one person actually willing to listen and change
for every fifty who think its their god given right to post whatever
the fuck they want however the fuck they want simply because they will
never have to answer for their actions in person, and I am being VERY
generous with that ratio.

That said I don't flame anyone for topposting, only for demonstrating
they know the guidelines and are topposting anyways. That was you, a
few weeks or months ago or whenever it was. Or those that deliberately
lie about whether or not top posting is accepted on usenet, which was
not you, but someone else who shall remain nameless....
