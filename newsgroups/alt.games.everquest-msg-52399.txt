And?

The amount of xp you lose when you die is based on how much was required to
gain the previous level. Making numbers up: If it takes you 20 million xp
to go through level 45, and 15 million to get through level 16, you die at
46, assuming that the death penalty is 10% (made up numbers, remember), you
lose 2 million xp. If level 44 takes 10 million, then a death in 45 would
cost you 1 million xp.

This is why death at 60 is such a pain in the ass, because 59 is the most
horrendous hell level of all hell levels, you lose a FULL YELLOW BUBBLE in
60 when you die. No other level has a death penalty anywhere near that
severe.
