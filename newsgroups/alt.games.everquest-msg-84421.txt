There is a topic posted at http://www.allianceofmagic.com that explains how
to do this.
Since I wrote it, I will post it again, here:

Ok... Here goes:
The following works very well for me as a Druid to increase my sense heading
and foraging skills. I'm not sure what they are but I do know they easily
and quickly max at every level. I'm a wood-elf compass now. haha
First you need to put your skills into the Ability slots on your screen. I
will assume you place sense heading in slot 1 (I'll leave it up to you to do
your other skills)
Click on your Socials button and create a new social by right clicking a
blank social button. Name this first one Sense. In the first command line,
place: "/doability 1". In the second command line place: "/loc"
Hit done and save it. Click and hold on the button now until it "pops-off".
Click on your User Defined Keys in slot 7.
Press F10 so you can see your OPTIONS button. Click it and go to Keyboard
options.
Whatever you use as your forward MOVEMENT KEY (I assume "W") you will now
place in your secondary activate slot for your User Defined Key 7 field. You
can select the SECOND slot by RIGHT clicking in the area below the User
Defined Key 7 field. Press the "W" key and you're all set!
Press F10 to go back to full screen mode and move forward. You should now
see your skill results in either a failure or a direction sensed... and a
bonus... your current LOCATION!

Every time you move forward, these skills activate. True, it only does it
once when you move forward, but how many times do you move forward in a
level? Yeah, it'll max. ;) Also, the LOC helps you a LOT by helping you to
locate items, places, people and your own corpse. Since you are getting a
fresh LOC every time you move forward, you just scroll up to see the
position you were at (aprx) when you died -- unless you were running away in
a line forever... haha

I have enhanced this a bit on my own setup to include the Sense heading and
LOC on forward, backward LEFT AND RIGHT. However, my LEFT and RIGHT keys
also practice my FORAGE skill by simply adding /doability 2 to the social
macro I use for that and setting it's activation key to my left and right
keys. You can set multiple user def keys to the same keyboard key... so you
can actually activate many many skills by simply wiggling left to right,
which is what I do when I am SoWed and running across a zone.. I need a new
bearing I dont even slow down, just a quick dodge left or right and I'm
good.

Also as a bit of a mod to the other Pre-ding, post-ding tip posted here
(http://www.eqdruids.com/reference/sharpening_the_sword.htm)... try setting
most or all or groups of those skills to social keys and placing them into a
user defined key. You'll love casting your line while you forage while you
sense a heading while you cast spell #1, just keep hitting the one key. Each
time a skill/spell is available to cast again, it will... make one to
include Spell #2 instead of #1... etc., for all 5 spells you want. - then
just have these all set up on an entire "DING" page of user defined keys so
that when you're done, you can flip back to your main Page 1 of User Def
keys and play without all the skills going off all the time.

Hope this helps!
