Hy.
Unfortunately the person who answered has either never played DAoC or sees
it with a weird angle.
DAoC is NOT PvP. It's RvR. what's the difference you'll ask ? Not a single
person in your own realm (Hybernia, Midgard or Albion) can attack you. You
cant even attack your trainer ! (memory of my first day in Eq). Can you do
PvP if you like ? yes ... in confronting other realms on specific areas
called Frontiers. You can hold some of their castles too, and do Siege type
war. Do you have to do PvP if you dont like it ? NO. My wife and i are about
to reach lvl 13 without ever encountering a single ennemy in Midgard. And
dungeons and zones in Midgard alone can take us to lvl 50 without having to
play in the Frontiers. RvR brings a whole new lvl to the game (keep in mind
that we don't loose exp in RvR battles, and that you DONT have to do
recovery on your corpse whatsoever. If you die, you reappear in a bind
point -everyone can bind btw- with all your equipment).
Now, my opinion about DAoC. I do prefer it compared to Eq. Nothing really to
rant about Verant or EQ. After a year and a half ... and many sides we came
to not like about it.. we decided to try DAoC. So far we feel it is superior
to Eq (comparing whats comparable... the size of the world of EQ seems quite
superior yet .. but with soon 3 expansions). Not everyone thinks so. So my
guess is you should try it IF you feel like trying another game . You have,
just as for Eq, one month free. But if you are really happy in Eq, and
giving the amount of time one has to invest in a MMORPG, stick to it )
