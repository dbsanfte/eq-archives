I think a rogue was required for me to kill the Prince in Chardok on Sunday,
and although I don't think they're REQUIRED I think it's highly recommended
you have one for Charassis, so yeah, they're getting to be more required.
Unfortunately the large majority of 50+ rogues are already in uberguilds.
For CoM if you don't line up a minimum 2 rogues the raid will fail because
at least 1 always fails to show up for one reason or another.

The guy is indifferent unless someone takes a swing at him.  I've done
reaver runs before where we spawned him and simply moved to the other side
of the room to avoid pissing him off.  Yup, mages are too freakin' rare on
Zeb, too.

For raiding it's a high level 30+ zone that is difficult to get to without
someone dying on the way in EJ (due to getting lost usually). It's not a
very friendly zone.  For regular hunting it's a low 40s+ zone that is too
much trouble to reach without a 39+ wizard or druid.

Uberguilds kill VS.  They rarely have any interest in VSR because they have
deemed druids to be nothing more than taxi whores.  It's amazing that
uberguilds could be that stupid, but it's true.
