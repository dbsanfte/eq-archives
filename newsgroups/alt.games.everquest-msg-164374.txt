My logic actually has some basis in reality.  Yours is completely
incomprehensible.  It's *not* the stats of the windblade that make it a
talked about weapon.  It's the stats on such an easily available weapon. 
Access to the weapon is the entire issue.

I'm still trying to figure out "if there's no monk equivalent to a windblade
then the warrior isn't using a windblade."  Did the spittle smear on your
monitor as you typed that?
