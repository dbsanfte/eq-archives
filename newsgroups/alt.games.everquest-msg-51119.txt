If you target a pet while in combat and taunt it it will turn on you, not
sure if you have to be grouped with the player who owns the pet for this to
happen or not (I always have been) but the pet has to be fighting for this
to happen, can't just taunt pets that are standing around. This always
happened to me in SK hunting at the spires where you'd get adds with no
crowd control and would have to start taunting mobs off the casters.
