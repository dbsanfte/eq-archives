I noticed an interesting effect with my Druid last night slumming in
Mistmoore.  None of:  casting Pack Regeneration, attacking an allied
mob, or simply standing there being KOS resulted in faction hits when
a mob died.  I had to:  be attacked by, attack, heal somebody on the
hate list of, or single target buff somebody on the hate list of the
particular mob.  Now, I'm pretty sure I recall getting faction hits
after merely being in the agro range of other players' mobs for just
a few seconds before they were killed (CB Orcs on the hill in GFay
come to mind).  But here I was, wading into the middle of a melee
involving mobs that would gleefully KOS me and casting a group buff
on the PCs fighting those mobs without receiving a faction hit (I
was annoyed too, +RoS faction was about the only reward I was getting
out of the whole exercise, raid xp for low blues is almost nothing).
