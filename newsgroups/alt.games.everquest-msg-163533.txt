You're a troll.
> Buh-bye.

lol

 In other words, you've shown your ignorance, and to keep from doing further
damage to yourself, you label me a troll. Try and read the header next time
genius and maybe you'll understand more. It was an opinionated thread and
you just cannot stand not being the center of attention, so you bring your
childish attitude and attack ones opinion in an open ended thread.

Go take a nap, re-think your contribution to the thread. Oh, and block me
please, cause I hate crybabies. Think out of the box for a change. You
looked pretty damn stupid with your original reply. The only one whining is
you punk. Let me guess, you spent all your money in rezzes, and paying
someone to PL you. Right ?

Learn to play, or go away.
