I've seen something like this once in blackburrow.  I had died down below,
and couldn't find my corpse.  Someone (GM maybe, forgot who), summoned my
corpse to the entrance near the zone, but I couldn't see it.  He swore it
was there, and I swore it wasn't.  I zoned out, then zoned in, and the
corpse was right where he said it was.
