I somewhat agree. However, I pay the same price to be a customer of a
subscription service as they do.  If another customer of your cable
company, paying the same subscription fee as you, was awarded HBO for
life or something because of some event he happened to go to would it
not bother you? 

I think customers should all be treated equally, or such items should
be awarded via a contest which ALL customers can enter.
