Hello,
I just completed a quest for my Lvl 10 DE Necro.
I got 4 pages for a tome, combined them and got a great book to read
while medding :-)

Ok, it is a secondary slot, no drop book with great stats for a young
necro.
Question: What are some good items to quest for as a Lvl 10-12 necro?
I look awful in the cloth armour I have. The only thing that helps is
the people who come by and say "Your lvl 10??  Go buy something!!!

Anyway, I will be checking out EQ Necro closely tonight.
Just thought someone would have some good ideas.

Thanks!
Rod
