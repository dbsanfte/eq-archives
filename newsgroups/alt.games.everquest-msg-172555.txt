Sure it can be a plus ... but in her context?? I wouldn't even begin to
formulate what you are suggesting, I to have run into many idiot people that
do these things.  for the first year i played I had never done/said anything
about it, i never knew about the PnP, didn't even know the GMs could do
those things, my friend who taught me the game was lucky enough to always be
able to solve his problems without GM help.  Those 2 would have been my goal
for the morning.

Personally, I would have asked them if I could use the bank for one quick
second before they killed the NPC, if I was told NO!, or any other answer
that was not "Why yes my good chap! I shall gladly share a spot o tea with
ya after" ... their replies would be enough to report in after that :) and
the above or below post about the GMs responding to this sort of thing? They
do so, and very quickly ... a few GMs respond very harshly too ...

Good luck connie, and use the /ignore command on the idiots right after you
ahve done your report and petition ... most of the bozos keep swearing or
being demeaning in /ooc and /shout after that, which usually gets even MORE
/report  & /petition

PS - a word of caution tho ... try not to take your disagreement to /ooc or
/shout until you are absolutely sure you ahve donee everything you can do to
resolve it ... I see alot of higher level(usually from a well respected
guild) players will come and try and help dissolve the situation before most
GMs are called in.
