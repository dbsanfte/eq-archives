It only happens to some people. If you read the knowledge base article
it happens when your amount of ram and your agp apeture combined equal
800 meg or more and windows 9x OS might reserve that amount of memory
in addresses which can sometimes make you actually get out of memory
errors for having 512 meg or more of memory.

A VERY simple way to prevent that is to use cacheman and to have it
set it up for you in the vcache wizard, you don't even HAVE to run
cacheman in the background.. I find it GREAT to do so because it
continually will free up memory with caching better than 98 did for
default by me when opening up tons of graphic files singily with a
viewer like irfanview or lviewpro from newsgroups. I set the wizard
for gaming and cacheman knew i have 128 meg ram so it suggest this:

[VCache]
MinFileCache=4096
MaxFileCache=14336

Which I then allowed it to do.
So with 512 meg ram I bet it sets a maxfilecache of like 64 meg if
gaming? The thing is, you don't even need that much if you have 512
meg of ram and for luclin you want as much free ram as possible. For
just running EQ I'd actually set the limit at like 32 meg ram vcache
with Luclin if I had 512 meg and see how that worked. Some stuff tells
you that the limit you should set if you set one should be no less
than 1/4 of your ram but I find that I like to have as much ram freed
up for the game as possible, and hey it runs great so yay.

It is. I originally discoverd cachman from people's suggestions when I
was having trouble with only 128 meg ram in Anarchy Online (the worse
mem management app in known computer or gaming history) It was about
the only thing that made AO tolerable so I just kept using it even
though I left AO behind. It continually keeps me from bogging in win98
even after running many programs or opening up many graphic files as I
said above.

Another great thing about cacheman is its great for setting up the
min/max size of your virtual swap file. Cacheman won't do that for
you, you still have to set it up under controlpanel/system/performance
virtual mem, but it is nice because it tells me that at my peak use in
Everquest the most I used is:

294 meg of a 500 meg min max virtual swap.

So actually we see that with 128 meg ram I could set it lower than 500
meg.. I just keep it there just in case. 350 would probably be very
safe.

It has other presets in the vcache wizard besides gaming, like general
use, etc.. and you can also move the sliders manually.
I'd ESPECIALLY try it with 512 meg of ram or more:

I LOVE the thing. Besides helping my performance A TON it taught me
more about windows 9x OS and caching and such than I ever knew.
