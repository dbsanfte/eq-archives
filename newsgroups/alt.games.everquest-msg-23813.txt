A patch or two ago it was mentioned that the Black panter armour had its
weight reduced makeing it a great(even greater) armour for monks. i looked
up the armour on castersrealm and allakhazams. now i REALLY want some. i
checked your site and a few others how do i make this? or is it a quest?
i have 200 in tailoring. i just cant find anyone who has made it or even
anyone who has it on. Did i just miss it somehow when looking on your
website?
Thanks
