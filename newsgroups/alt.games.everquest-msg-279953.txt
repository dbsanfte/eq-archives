Everquest is a good game in many respects, but keying/flagging destroyed the 
game for many players.
So if youve been in a good guild that has kept its membersahip over the 
years, you probably enjoy it.
If you are a new player comtmplating joining, chances you will be locked out 
of most of the content with no way to catch up.

I played for about 5 years, and was always in the "catching up" phase. The 
guilds I was in continuously lost the stronger
player to higher level guilds, (Maybe I should have shafted my friends for 
the sake of progression too), so as a guild we
were unable to progress. Guild after guild fell apart, and the problems wre 
always major bottlenecks in the flagging process
... Getting the rift from emp for VT access (always cockblocked by other 
guilds trying to keep us out of VT)
... Killing RZ... the encounter requiring a zerg force rather than 
individual skill... which we couldnt muster being a guild of about 40 ppl 
max.

Eventually I got past both of these to have that guild basically fall apart 
when WOW started.
So excuse me if im somewhat jaded, but after paying for 2 server transfers 
and being in about 4 different guilds, my advice to any new starting player 
is to stay the hell away from this game. WOW may have its faults, bot in 
terms of server reliability, and guild operas, but at least most of the 
zones are open, and you can choose the limit of how high you want to raid, 
rather than having to flag your way up to make "progress".

If eq were to simply remove flagging from the game, I would give it a 
glowing endorsement. However despite the overwhelming majority of people 
hating it, and losing half their clients, SOE have stuck with it, although 
admittadely they have now provided "side quests" to flag yourself 
individually, tho I believe these quests still require reagents from within 
the zone you want to be flagged for, basically requiring you to sweet talk 
your way into someone elses raid.

So there you have it.
