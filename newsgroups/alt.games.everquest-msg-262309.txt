And, oh, the smiles on every face,
As happy lad and lass
Through grass knee-deep on Casey?s place
Went riding down to Mass.


While round the church in clothes genteel
Discoursed the men of mark,
And each man squatted on his heel,
And chewed his piece of bark.


"There?ll be bush-fires for sure, me man,
There will, without a doubt;
We?ll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
"Before the year is out."
