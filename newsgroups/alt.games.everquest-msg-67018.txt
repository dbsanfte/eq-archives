Yes, and IMO it's always been a mistake to push too hard.  Origin
turned off a lot of people pushing this very same way with basically
the attitude of, "Fuck you, buy a better machine!"

I don't think it's unrealistic to say that the current requirements
for Luclin are quite drastically above what the average EQ subscriber
has.

You really think that's a good idea?  Personally, I think they've shot
themselves in the foot.
