Thank you for that excellent reply on how to choose a guild.

I consider it more a courtesy thing and an indication of a bit of
"maturity" and thought of other players. A simple indication of their
timezone offset is reasonable.

However, what I was probably sub-consciously thinking was that at least
someone who replies is likely to use the internet and have learnt some
of the basic skills and tactics.

Whilst I'm happy to help new chars sort out slots, hot key linking etc,
I am not prepared to teach grouping tactics to a people in a guild[1].
There is a pile of material around on the internet and people should
read it and save their guildmates a pile of grief. It is so much better
that they educate themselves, than the acrimonious bun fights that
sometimes (too often) occurs in a group.

I became used to dieing in terrible groups, but am rapidly learning the
signs of when to fire Selos(SOW), pocket weapons, load drum and RUN[2].
On the otherhand, there are some groups where everyone knows some
tactics and they usually go well. Occassionally, very rarely, you get
into a group where the leader actually acts like a leader, outlines
tactics, and runs the group in battle and is supported by others who
work as a team.

My first guild was one of those who went around screaming who wants to
join (a danger sign) and guildinviting everyone LFG that night (it
seems). I think someone was doing a quest and rather than do easy shake
down/training raids or groups, tough targets were on from the go. The
results was four massive death tolls from four raids, then lots of
bitching because people didn't come. Apart from the fact that I don't
have the expansion packs to go where they went, I was glad I didn't make
any (late announcements being one factor).

My second guild is still settling in (another new one) and looks like it
will work out, although about 50% have no real idea of grouping tactics.
Atm, I play at odd times around the clock between sporadic work, they
are mostly on at times that I need to keep free for work.

[1] I really only have a lvl 34 bard and have never played anything else
except a couple of low warriors (pre grp lvls).

[2] Would be a least two levels further if I learnt that one faster. It
really boosts your confidence when your group dies, dies, dies and dies
and you watch your exp flying away.
