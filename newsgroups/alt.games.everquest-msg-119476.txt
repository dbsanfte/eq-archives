There are no new servers except special rule or expensive ones.  The latest
server is Antonius Bayle based in Europe.  There hasn't been a non-split
server (except special rules) for probably going on 2 years now.

E'Ci is one of the original servers.
No idea about the Sleeper
Probably
There MIGHT be an overpopulated server out there, but I don't know of any.
E'Ci and Rathe split about 15 months ago to Zeb so I imagine their
population is about the same as Rathe and Zeb...and that's good.
