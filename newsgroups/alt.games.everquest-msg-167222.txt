Definitly worth it.

For most caster types you will have to go to different cities to get your
spells or songs somewhere after lvl 15 or so. My bard was able to get his
songs missing from Erudin, then on to Keletin, make a quick stop at Quenos
and then to Freeport so he could hunt in Oasis..... in less then 15
minutes!! I bought songs a few levels higher in advance to make it easy.

The PoP books are always in the Newbie zones - out of sight of the guards so
if you are evil or good aligned and want to visit an oposite city you can
with no problems..... just don't enter the city :)

My bard is now in his early 30ties and I bought it when he was 25 or so. I
can't enter any plane until 47 but it has already been worth it!

Also, the PoK is accessible to all levels.... you can make a Vah Shir
beastlord if you like and level em up in Everfrost. Or West Freeport. Or
whereever :)
