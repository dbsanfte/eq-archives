I think it's called Kael, not that I've been there yet. I was hoping someone
on rodcet nife would be raiding and wouldn't mind me throwing the odd
shuriken or spell for factional purposes. Not that I can fight there, not
tough enough, especially as I understand my AC has been nerfed.

On a side note, I have a 49 monk, maxed 1hb and dual weild and fly kick,
with a stave of shielding and a trance stick, and was noticing a 35th level
paladin out damaging me... i had trouble maintaining aggro. I thought monks
were supposed to be high DPS characters, but the only thing I had over him
was my ability to avoid damage. Now that's been nerfed.

Not Impressed.
