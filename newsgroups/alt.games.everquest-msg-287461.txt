You're bound for as long as you use their software.

Yes you have.  You haven't broken *criminal* law, but you have broken
contract law.

Yes there is!  Again, it's not a criminal law, but contract law.

Why do you say it's $0?  At the very least, Sony could say that you
owe them their monthly fee for as long as you continued using their
software.

You broke contract law, yes.  They can't throw you in jail for it, but
you can be sued.
