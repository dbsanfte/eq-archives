I figured as much, but I myself have never done it, so I did not want to
assume that this was the case.

So the dark blues that are on the border of being light-blue?  Also dex
is currently at 127, so I would imagine that is sufficient for some quick
skillups?

I was under the impression that skill-ups happen regardless if you hit the
mob or not, as long as it was a successful swing.  Though I could be wrong
on this.

My taunt is maxxed, so tanking is never a problem.  But as I always
understood, is that warriors use 1hs/b/p 95% of the time at higher levels,
and it would make more sense as you are generating more aggro.  So would
it be safe to say that perhaps getting skill-ups on 2hs may not be the way
to go and that I should really focus on 1hb piercing instead?

Thanks again.
