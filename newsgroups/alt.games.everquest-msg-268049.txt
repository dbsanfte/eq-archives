Yep, found that out. Had to craft something so I could ding and then
join The Scriveners Society. 

Kind of weird but as I thought of it when I had 220% experience before
my citizenship quest and I dinged as soon as the quest was finished,
the quest gave me experience. The tradeskill quest gives no experience
and the game seems to check for dings after experience given.
