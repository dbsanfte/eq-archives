You post makes my post even more relevant.  If I equip my enchanter with
enough +mana to cast these spells, then the 'You won't have enough mana'
argument can be dismissed.

As for the original argument...

I was just trying to equate caster classe twinking to melee classe.  It is
my belief that the 'twink' affect placed on casters is much less than on the
melee class.  And if it is VI's intention to 'nerf' classes to even them
out, this may be a possible solution.

Peace and Love!
