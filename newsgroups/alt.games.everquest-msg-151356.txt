I got to set up my account and  station id, created my first character (gee
that rotate can be annoying), selected server all the biz. The only problem
arises with the video options, all items not checked need some 115 mb ram, i
only have 32mb Ram. selecting min res and texture does little to reduce
this. it sugests modfy the install removing armour etc.
 The system is P166 with 32 meg ram voodoo 2 3000 with 16 MB win 98 DirectX
8.1.
The demo works ok on it smooth. the character creation screens were fine.
what i need to do is reduce the physical mem required to what i have. i
remember that there was somewhere information which regarded low spec
machines and what they could do to increase performance by removing some of
the new files or some such thing.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
