In the end, I think this will be the *only* solution to making this
"kinder gentler Ragefire" scheme work out. The entire Naggy loot table
should be dropped off of Rage, and the heart should be no-rent. Absor's
answers to these questions, which came rushing in *IMMEDIATELY* from the
player community were simply mind boggling. I'm now firmly convinced
that he's never played the game beyond just running around with one
character on the test server, etc.  If he'd ever played a non-GM
character up to epic levels and was in a guild he would know that:

1. The guild is going to go get the cleric their damned epic at any
cost, no matter if there is zero loot and they're all going to die in
the process.
and
2. Making it no-rent is absofuckinglutely NO different than the old
system. The cleric could *STILL* go linkdead back then after the turnin,
be unable to log back in, and lose everything. The only difference (and
improvement) now is that they'll never have to start over once they get
the swirling pearl. Making the heart box no-rent takes away the last
vestage of an excuse for any group to kill rage without a cleric ready
to complete epic in their ranks. Unless they're just grief players, of
course. But no design changes in the world are going to help that.
