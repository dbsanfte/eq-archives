Not true.  The fact that a shaman was always a better choice is
undisputable.  The thing is, giving a shaman a better heal makes him an even
better choice... it's no longer "shaman or cleric, whichever one we can
get."  It's now "get a shaman."  Giving druids better healing increases
their desireablilty when it's coupled with their utility.  That bumps
clerics even farther down the list.  Still, I've left groups where the
members didn't want to fight because a druid was the only healer left "lets
get a healer before we continue."  And this was with my paladin.  The druid
and I went to duo while the rest of the group sat around with their tumbs
implanted in their kiesters.

My point was not to suggest that the heals are a bad thing (though Paladins
should get them as well), but to say that it does change things, contrary to
what you suggest.

Often with pick-up groups, you don't know all the characters that are
wanting to join.  Given that, basing it on classes does make sense.  Still,
I have yet to say "no" when the group leader asks "get the (insert class
here)" unless we really need something specific, ie we have no healer, or my
bard is main tanking....

None the less, pick-up groups are a big part of the game, as a whole.
Whether or not you choose to participate in them does not diminish that
fact.  For many (especially those in smaller guilds), it's how leveling gets
done.

That's your style of play, man.  It doens't hold true for everyone.
