The problem is, tailoring is a <expletive deleted> skill to succeed at and even
harder to raise. Silk thread and swatches become trivial at (if memory serves)
17. Raw silk at 35 and cured silk at 85. In the space between 17 and 35, expect
to go through A LOT of silk swatches with nothing to show for it. Even worse is
cured silk. My halfling druid, equipped to 130 WIS, started cured silk with a
skill of 54. Three and a half stacks of silk swatches making masks (one swatch,
one pattern and one heady kiola) resulted in 12 cured silk masks and a skill of
57. I would blame it on bad luck, but from the EQTraders boards this is very
typical and only gets worse.

Good luck.
