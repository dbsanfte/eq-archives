I was in a group at the ledge in OT a few days ago, and there was an argumnt
over who we should have in the group. Anyway along omes a tough doubl pull,
and at that point one of the losers of the argument just disbands from the
group. Final result was on person died that combat. It was close, and we
would have been ok with the other guy. Way I see it is he caused the death
of one of our party so he gets to be on ignore, and I wont be grouping with
him again.

I consider myself jutified, so there is absolutely no question about you
being out of line.
