Yep, that's me.

After thinking that I had plumbed the lowest depths of stupidity with my
Hat Trick, I go one better.

I teleported the wrong person.

Okey, in my defense, I have to say that the guy shared the first four
letters of his name with the prospective customer, and that he *did*
group with me without arguing when I invited him.

Anyway, no harm done... He was bound near where I picked him up, and
used the trip to WC to collect some supplies from nearby Neriak, so the
story has a happy ending.

Still, try to picture my expression when just after the port, the
customer /tells me "Where are you?" at the same time the poor guy asks
me "Where are we?". 'Apologetic' doesn't begin to describe it...
