Generalisation which is not always true.  Lots of times when slowing 
before being engaged and slowing before 80% after being engaged make sense.

There is never one single way to deal with mobs.

Shamans will often get aggro when slowing mobs, it's why people who play 
shamans like wizards often struggle in the later levels.

With some mobs, your tank is already dead if you haven't slowed before 
80% or the tank is alive but your healer is being eaten.
