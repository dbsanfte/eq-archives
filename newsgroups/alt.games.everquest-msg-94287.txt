You should be fine, the goblins will be stupid and attack you if they're
green however sometimes, and past a certain point start to see through
invis, basically don't go through the gate with goblins around it near the
entrance (and don't fall in lava either), just stick around outside clearing
gobbies for a while, perhaps pulling ones from the gated area, then fighting
your way back past it.
