You should start up a character on Sullon* for a lark before you go...=P

Don't worry about "leet pvping" or levelling, just do really dumb things
which hopefully at least a few other people will find humorous.

Back in the UO days, sometimes I would log in and think "Is this really
fun?", then just start doing something really dumb like lay a line of fish
on the ground, head to tail, from Skara Brae to Brittania... (Thanks Dundee
and Shade - I used the fish from your macro piles=P)

You get all sorts of reactions - some insults, some laughs, some other
people even join in. Regardless, before you know it the Server is just that
little bit less serious, which is definitely A Good Thing.

You may find that a "fun attitude" to playing resparks your waning interest.
Don't burn your bridges totally though, leave at least one still standing.

Cheers

*Choose Sullon, as doing goofy things, even if harmless, would properly get
you petitioned on other servers because some people have no sense of the
humour let alone a sense of the bizzare...
