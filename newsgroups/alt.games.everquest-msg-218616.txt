Ah, but is it appropriate for me to be compelled by law to pay for
my neighbor's children's diseases under these circumstances?  (The
circumstances being the parents knowing there was a non-trivial chance
they'd pass on severe genetic issues yadda yadda yadda.)

Sure, tattoo my forehead with the words "NO COMPASSION" if you like;
you'll probably get lets of support from the people in this newsgroup.
I, however, think there should *always* be compelling reasons for
the government to mandate that I'll hand my wallet to my neighbor.

I'm not suggesting that.  Oftimes, I can identify problems, but not
