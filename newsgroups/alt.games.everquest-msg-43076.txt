This is exactly what happened.  I'm one of the founders of the attacked
guild, "Collective of Dark Honour" on Terris-Thule.  A dozen of us broke of
from the Horde of Steele to create a guild that was more suited to doing
stuff then just sitting around talking.  The old leader got pissed, felt we
had betrayed him, deleted his characters and account, and then started
spreading rumours on every media he could find.

If you'd like to read our charter, its at www.kameelyon.com/collective   As
you will notice, we don't even have a tithe system.  The only thing we ask
is that anything given to you by the guild remains in the guild.  i.e. If we
give you an Elder Spiritst helm, and you get something better, give the ES
back to the guild for redistribution.
