> 10.b. including that ra-errrw sound they make when being hit

    NO!!! "ra-errw" is their attack sound.

    Their being hit sound is so totally imprinted into my subconscious that
I can't put it into phonetics, but did you know there's a bell-tinkling sort
of noise during the last half of it? I can't get that out of my head.

    11. You have learned the difference in sound between a giant running and
a skelley walking (slighty footstep frequency difference I think, but once
again so ingrained into my subconscious that the identification is
automatic, I can't really tell you how I do it for sure :)

    Well I tend to pull with a 300 point DoT with 60% snare, and that's
rather difficult to top, especially considering I follow up with a pet that
quads for 39's and a weapon that can double hit for a pair of 200's (god I
love that halberd) but when you're up against a wizzy with Ice Comet.....
good luck.

    I look forward to the 1000hp dot I get at 61.... although I'm not sure
I'll still be hunting hill giants then. I might well be in a mental
institution if I am.

    I've yet to see a rogue in there lol mustn't be a popular strategy on
Povar.

> 13. You begin to know when Hasten is up

    PPL usually post when he's up so <shrug>

    See other post. Every wandering mob in the area is a PHer for giants, so
far as I can tell.
