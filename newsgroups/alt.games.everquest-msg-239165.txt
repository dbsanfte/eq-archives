There are a number of items available but depending on your class I
dont know which would be most appropriate (I do know that one of my
guildies has collect many of them & had some difficulties at 65).  To
find out whats you could get do a bit of research on Lucy.

http://lucy.allakhazam.com & search spells using Illusion as the key
word.

Alternativley find a friendly enchanter whose spent AA in project
illusion :)
