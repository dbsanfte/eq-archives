Yeah, but how often has someone asked you to zone twice and spend 600
plus mana then get back to what you were doing to res them? I bet 99.9
percent of the free rezes you gave the corpses were in the zone and
dragged to your feet. Its apples and oranges.

If my druid could just translocate someone near it for 300 mana or so
I'd do it a lot more for free also.
