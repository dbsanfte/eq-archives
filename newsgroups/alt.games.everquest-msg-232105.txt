Well the core unit for that Virtuality was an AMiga in that time span
(3000 is ringing a bell in my head)

My friends and I have always been nuts about multiplayer games of any kind
(2 have set up and run companies based entirely on that) so I can try and
find out....since some of them are doing a lot with wireless stuff I'll
see if they have any voice comm options for mobiles coming out for
supplementing the wireless games.
