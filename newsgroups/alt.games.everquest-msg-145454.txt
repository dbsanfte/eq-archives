at what level? 60? i see most of the people here refer to the 60th end
game encounters routinely as if everyone in the game is already 60th.
ok....so befallen has a locked door. what else?

apart from not even being able to play them int he role of a rogue
because verants "vision" limits it to backstabbing and end game 60th
level lockpicker.

thats what im talking about....not everyone is in SSRA. why not just
make all players 60th with the next patch and i can stop my bitching.

and these are? befallen? ok...im not the most traveled player but i
also know of a trap in TOFS off to the side that someone has to
blunder into. also a spore trap in paludal. but apart from that when
you mention ZONES are you referring strictly to some special dungeons?
apart from sebilis, howling stones, ssra and some other high level
stuff where are the traps and locks that prevent access without a
rogue? (also...we couldnt have survived D&D without the trusty Knock
spell. in EQ they could make it a looooong recast time and a lot of
mana usage for groups without a rogue)

To say that rogues are the most desirable classes is to be someone in
a guild with ready made groups, someone getting pleveled or an uber
twink to get to the levels where a rogue IS necessary. from levels 1
to 59 that just isnt true. I have one of every class there is.....some
of them in the 50s and most in the 20s and 30s. I continually see
rogues just give up after oocing for a group and my rogue has a hard
enough time as well. it isnt a bad thing to make classes more
versatile at lower levels too. rogues need to be more than a
backstabber (monk damage without FD)
