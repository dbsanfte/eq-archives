The latest patch (July 10 & 11) changed pathing for pursuing animals in
the Kelethin Newbie zone, so I would not be surprised if it changed the
paths across the front of Kaladim as well.

In Kelethin, if you run to the newbie lift, you now see the mob pursuing
you run over to the POD lift and ???. Wait a few minutes and wander out
again and WHAM - it gets you again. This was happening a few days ago on
Bristlebane.
