You have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Some
italians like to comment on things that they apparently have no knowledge
about. Too much pasta eating?

>It used to be called civil rights, you might know.

It still is. All it really boils down to is equal protection under the law.
Business owners still get to choose who they do and do not do business
with. If I wanted to exclude all black people from my home (not that I
would, this is an example), there is fuck-all that anyone could do about
it.

It's nice that you think that, but you are wrong.
