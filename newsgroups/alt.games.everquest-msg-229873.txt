I've been watching this thread since its beginning, and I can only ask 
this:  Is this guy so lame that the only recourse he sees as being 
available to him to spout off about how this discussion was not about 
tob/bottom posting (when someone proves him to be totally and completely 
idiotic and unable to listen to reason), then "/ignore"?  I mean, come 
on!  Andrew top posted.  He was called on it, and thus was born a sub-
thread when he started bitching aobut it (go 'head, Andy, /ignore me too!  
I never been told I was being ignored in this newsgroup...I dare ya! 
After all, I used the "B" word).  In other words, HE hijacked the thread, 
then complains that he's been handed his ass on a silver platter by those 
that have checked his "sources".

And a hearrty "BRAVO" to DT and the rest that have persisted in calling 
his bluff.

To Andy (Andrew, @ndrew, whatever the hell you call yourself):  You 
bemoanthe fact that some people here resort to cussing, some earlier than 
others in their posts.  Have you ever spent time in the RW?  I know of 
MANY people that cuss every other word, and not just because they're 
pissed off or frustrated, either.   It's the way some people communicate.  
Get over yourself, ANDY.  Buy a clue, rent one, borrow one, whatever, 
JUST GET ONE!  

If this situation had been:  Andrew top posted; DT (or whoever the first 
was, can't remember and too lazy to look it up) called him on it; Andy 
said "pardon me, I'm sorry!" and corrected his actions WITHOUT resorting 
to his bullshit, ad infinitum, well, all would be well and good.  

But, NO!  @ndy had to show he was superior, and begin an argument that he 
will undoubtably (sp?) lose.  His response to those that prove beyond a 
resonable doubt that he is a lame excuse for humanity (as it pertains to 
usenet)?  /Ignore.  Bah.  My 4 year old daughter is more articulate than 
that!

I'd killfile Andy, but this whole thread has become sort of a game I 
enjoy watching, and I HAD to put my own comments in!  I porbably won't 
post in this thread again, but I reserve the right to do so.

P.S.  Andy, Who gives a good fuck what the OTHER newsgroups you visit 
regard aas acceptable practice in regards to top or bottom posting?  THIS 
AIN'T THE OTHER GROUPS - IT'S ALT.GAMES.EVERQUEST!  The 
accepted/preferred/required method has been told to you, and you can't 
let it go at that.  Want to end the damn argument-fest?  THEN SHUT THE 
FUCK UP AND QUIT POSTING ON IT!  (And if you were to have any input now 
or in future about anythign ON topic in this group, I'm pretty sure there 
would be MANY MANY regulars that would ignore or even debate your point 
just because it's you.  'Nuff said.

To the group:  Sorry this was so long.  I now return you to DT and the 
rest of the flaming staff of AGE.  Proceed :)
