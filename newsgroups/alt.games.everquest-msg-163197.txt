Windows XP has an integrated firewall software that is disabled by
default. You can turn it on somewhere in network properties in your
control panel. Probably under an advanced option. If you don't do this
then anyone on the internet can spawn those irritating messenger
service windows on your computer. Once the firewall is turned on you
should be safe from any further popus. Works for me anyway.

You can also go into control panel/services and disable the windows
messenger service, but this may interfere with other windows apps that
try to use the service to pop up messages.
