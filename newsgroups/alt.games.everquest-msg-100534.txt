Argumentum ad populum. And wrong, even at that. *I* play a porter
class as my primary, and I never make that assumption. If I can't take
the client to the exact spot they want, I always let them know up
front.

Large populations have historically assumed all kinds of things, but
that doesn't automatically make them right.

>Blaming the porter for not telling him is just plain Noob.

And an argumentum ad hominem. It's like double coupon days here.
