Ah, so you don't mind if I've spent hundreds of hours of raiding before I am
good enough to join your group.   If I prefer, I can spend hundreds of hours
doing LDoN's instead to meet your prerequisite. Or buy a bunch of plat on
E-bay, and then be geared up enough to try tanking your experience group.
Thank you so much.

Just out of curiousity, how many LDoN's did your enchanter have to do before
he was considered groupworthy?   Or your average ranger or cleric?   How
much bazaar gear does a beastlord or necro have to buy?   How many AA's
before you accept that a wizard or rogue has earned a spot in your group?
