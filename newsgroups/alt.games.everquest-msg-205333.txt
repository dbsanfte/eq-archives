I'd have to say it is definitely stastically significant.  In my stable of
50+ characters, I have more females than males.  I can count the number of
items I have been randomly given while on male characters on the fingers of
one foot.  Not to say that I was showered with gifts on the female
characters, but there *were* items, with each one of them, which is a marked
difference from the male characters.
