  Well, I seen your name and went "Oh Chit", here we go.

I mis-judged your character and felt like a fool after I read it.
Very humble apologies :-)

 The thought and intention are appreciated :-)

Have a Nice Day Mr. Brat :-)

All insults retracted, and apologies initiated. You've show such class =

    First of all, If you must bash, please pass this post by.

    My Son loves EQ and he is 9 years old. He elected to try a Human =
warrior cause according to him, "It sounded Tight" whatever that means.
    He is now a level 8 and works hard in groups. He will not let a =
group member die, and this gets him into trouble a bit.=20
     He has this bad habit of following others suggestions like going =
where lvl 8 Warriors don't have a chance of surviving.=20
     Now, I am a Level 19 SK and I can usually get him out of situations =
as I have done twice before. But this last time, he lost all the stuff =
(Chain Armor, Velium Sword and Shield, ect) that me and his older =
brothers have managed to get and give to him. Lesson learned for sure =
and I think after 2 weeks of no armor, he is showing more smarts.
     I have spent the last two weeks earning money killing Leggo's, =
Desert Madmen, and Willows so I could get enough to get him restarted.
     Thursday is his bday, and today I took the day off , signed on with =
his name and began the dangerous task of Drop Transfers.
     I did great and managed to give him my back-up Fine Steel Sword, =
Lots of leather, A Backpack,and some food.=20
     While changing a nice Kite Shield, and 27 pp, I found that it =
wasn't there after I dropped it. Guess it happens.

     Now, I have 10pp left and I really would like to get him some sort =
of Shield. Could some one steer me in the right direction of where I =
could get one for about that price ? (Freeport, WC,EC,Ro)

    Its totally different being a Dad as opposed to being "GetsumJ" the =
local mouth. And if you help me this one time, I will never bash in the =
NG again cause I am really trying to surprise him.

    And please, if you despise me, come kill me. Not my sons. That's a =
lil too personal.
