I'm one of 2 post 50 mages in my guild - the other is just 50, and 
isn't played much.  The funny thing is that 49 and 50 were the fastest
levels, bar none.  I started a play session at 6 one morning with no
visible xp in 50, at 10:30 I dinged 51, and had an extra 400+ pp after
selling the gems and Harpoon I'd looted.  I REALLY wish they'd left
the post 50 firepets alone, since 29 the firepet has been my mainstay.

With a 49 firepet I was able to easily keep up with the 4 double spawn
of BG's on the top, I just let my pet solo one of the pale blues every
circuit.  Over a yellow an hour.  Yesterday I was lucky to get a blue
in 51 in the hour I was seriously trying to xp.  :-/
