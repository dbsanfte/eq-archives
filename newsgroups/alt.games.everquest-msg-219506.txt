These classes had plenty of utility in the PvE leveling part of DaoC.
The problem is, after supporting other classes in their grind to 50 for
the endgame, they're then given the boot in favor of buffbots who don't
steal part of the realm points for kills, allowing groups to be made up
of melee classes with one token run fast class added.

As well, they unbalance the already poorly balanced game in other ways.
The rogue classes are supposedly designed to steath and kill other rogue
classes, as they get a see hidden ability no other classes get. However,
these rogue on rogue duels become terribly unbalanced when one of them
is buffed up to max by their bot, who, unlike a normally played
character, will have their buff line maxed out at the expense of their
other utility lines. In extreme cases, there were tales of fully buffed
rogues going head to head with the other realm's main tank classes and
winning.

Enough of DaoC though, how many EQ players have a second boxed shammy
they drag along to experience groups to support the group from outside
as well. Prior to LDoN, this was actually a good thing I found, as it
always seemed a significant number of shaman prefered soloing anyway so
it was like pulling teeth to try to get a slower for a planes group.

Fortunately, LDoN has made bot shaman a lot less useful, as the time
pressure doesn't really allow for a slow enough pace for most two boxers
to handle, though I've been in a few groups where one of the melee was
botting a shaman. On the other hand, at least a couple of guild shaman
have expressed a dislike for LDoN for the same reason. They want their
new spells but aren't particularly happy that they're forced to group
for them. Again, fortunately, at 65 at least, BST slow is quite adequate
to the task and most of the BST's I know are quite happy to group.
