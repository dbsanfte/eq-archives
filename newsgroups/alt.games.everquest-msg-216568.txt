   I am a EQ-L player, no need put those of us who are interested in it
in a different camp.

   About the beta, I am of two minds of this.  One, yes, I think it
would be cool to be in the beta.  It would really feel like an explorer,
finding out things about the places and ways of the game before everyone
else did.  On the other hand, that which I am exploring might well
change, rendering any exploration moot.  Beta's tend to be buggy
(understandably) and frustrating to play.  And of course, I couldn't get
to attached to a character I know is doomed to being deleted.

   I think I would still want to be in the beta, though.
