Whilst waiting for login server to unclog, I was finally getting around to
reading last month's issue of Popular Science. I got to page 21, and stopped
dead in my tracks. Everquest has an advertisement there.

Now, EQ has ads in many computer game magazines, and that only makes sense.
Those adds usually show some combination of warriors, trolls, assorted nasty
critters, and of course the delightfully rendered and scantily clothed elf.

What made this ad different is that I almost mistook it for a liquor ad. It
is not a drawing, there is no huge EVERQUEST logo, and not even a single
sword! What it does depict are two lovely women in evening attire at a bar,
sipping cocktails. The brunette is facing the blonde, gushing about--and I
quote the headline--"He's opened up a whole new world for me!"

After the peals of laughter about how patently ridiculous the concept was, I
had to salute the marketing folks at Sony Online. What an excellent concept:
not only is it a fun game, but extreme hotties at bars will be telling their
friends about you and this wonderful online experience. It must be love, and
no doubt that EQ is going to get you laid.

Cheers!
