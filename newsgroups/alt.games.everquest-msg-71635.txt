Hmm i had a similar problem with the design but the actual game was fairly
easy. I like pvp a fair amount but quake, red baron and other such games
fill that role completely. No reason to spend 6 monthes to train your pvp
toon to then engage in pvp that was not balanced and either had no effect or
had an effect that made a previous inbalance worse. I liked the pve aspect
of starcraft far more than the pvp but quake is such a better pvp game than
it ever was a pve.

I pretty much think that all mmorgs to be sucessfull will be mainly pve
based and they should encourage grouping as well. Eq is almost right, the
only thing that bugs me is the relative imbalance of casters to melee and
that can still be fixed by removing all chances for a spell to be resisted
and upping the meditation rate.
