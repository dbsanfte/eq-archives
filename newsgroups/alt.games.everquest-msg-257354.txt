You know, I sort of think one caster nuke timing problem might be 
because they feel that they need to wade in nuking so they are 
'working' and not 'slacking off' until the mob is at half 
HP...and thusly get agro. As a cleric, I want to tie them up and 
only let them stick a hand out to cast a nuke when the mob is at 
half health just so I dont have to heal them or even get agro off 
them myself...

Coming out of a cleric perspective where I was sitting staring 
into a book I don't really feel the need to immediately do 
anything except perhaps send off Poofy the Wonder Hammer until 
the mob is ready for some light cleric whapping, a random cast of 
judgement or me to start healing someone [unless I need to be 
casting a stun, or using something to suck the mob off the stupid 
robecaster...]
