Have  a read through this, posted by a 70 warrior on our guild forums:

Aggro breakdown

Aggro can be broken down into Hate + bonus

The hate portion is what you would commonly call aggro by itself, this is
the actual value of hate you have.
The bonus part, varies with a few things, like distance to mob, if you are
sitting or not etc. The closest person to the mob gets a bonus for proximity
more than others. (Low hp aggro is also a result from a huge (would say
almost infinite) bonus)

What this basically means is, you can have less hate than a caster who is
sitting far away, and more aggro - but - when they sit for example, their
bonus takes them over you're total aggro, and the mob makes a beeline for
them.

Taunt as a skill, puts you to the top of the hate list. Chaining taunt when
you have aggro already is pretty much futile, it does nothing if you are the
one at the top. However, periodically taunting can be a good thing, as this
makes sure that its not just bonus thats keeping the mob fixed on you.

Procs


Weapon procs are a key aspect of maintaining aggro.

Procs that generate good hate:
Anger - ~1200 hate (this is the daddy of procs, 650 hate + stun + debuff+
dd)
Enraging blow - 700 hate
Anger II / III - 600 hate
Chaotic strike line - 500 hate (this is a ballpark figure, the actual value
of stuns can be debated untill the end of time, but they are fixed - unless
they have special modifiers like some pally stuns - and indeed static blow
on fleshbiter)
Misc stuns, force shock, ykesha etc

Decent hate: (<stuns)
Ac debuffs
Snare

Bad hate : (should be avoided for aggro purposes)
DD's
DoT's


A proc does not have to land to generate aggro, it will do its job even if
resisted. (pure hate cannot be resisted) This includes stuns that are too
low to work on a mob. [out of interest, ykesha procs all have a resist mod
and stun to 65, chaotic strike procs all have -150 mr check and stun to lvl
70]

With DoN we found an alternative to doing LDoN for Anger / ykesha augs.
Enraging blow and chaotic strike are both very viable choices. There has
been much debate on which one to choose, but most agreee that it is personal
preference. CS is a bit less aggro, but has some dps and can stun casters.
EB is the highest aggro aug, and that in itself is enough for some.


Proc Rate


The rate at which you proc is dependant on the following:
Dex (up to 255, after this it does nothing)
Weapon affinity AA
Combat effects (high end mod)
Weapon innate mod (only affects the weapons innate proc)


The base proc rate for mainhand (with 255 dex but nothing else) is 2 ppm
With WA5 this goes up to 3ppm mainhand, 2ppm offhand
(This is an AVERAGE, you can proc 4 times in a row sometimes, but it
balances out)
These values do NOT change. They are fixed, (assuming none of the proc rate
modifiers mentioned change) and will stay fixed even if you are slowed /
hasted. What will change is your chance to proc PER SWING.

Note: proc rates are for EACH PROC
example: Copper hammer of striking auged with anger 3 mainhand
Sword of the bloodsworn with anger 2 offhand
no. of procs :
3 Force shock
3 Anger III
2 Planar stun
2 Anger II
=10ppm

Check order:
1) Weapon innate
2) Augment
3) Spell proc

If the weapon proc doesnt go off, it checks the aug, then spell proc.
(Spell procs are usually in the form of buffs - spirit of the leopard,
clicky on AHR gloves, symbol of the planesmaster, and in one case for
warriors - aura of runes disc)

Melee hate

Aggro does not end at procs. Melee hate is a substantial part of total hate.

Melee hate formula per swing: Damage+damage_bonus(mod1/mod2)

mod 1 : class speicific
mod 2 : aggro modifiers like Voice of thule, Echo of anger (takes highest
value)

Everytime you swing with the same weapon, you generate a fixed amount of
hate. It does not matter if the swing misses, hits for max, or min. ATK,
STR, Accuracy all have NO effect on melee hate. ALL that matters is the
weapon ratio

2 handers have a very good record of generating solid hate purely through
melee. The Blade of War was such a great weapon not for the innate EB, but
because it has a fantastic ratio pre EP.

2 handers generate good aggro for the start of a fight, but what tends to
happen is the superior proc rate (assuming proper procs in proportion to the
ratio) of a 1 hander setup surpasses the 2 hander over time. Streak procs
can make or break a 1 hander setup. (no procs, lose aggro, streak procs,
vast aggro) 2 handers dont have this problem, they generate pretty reliable
aggro.


Spells

A lot of spells have built in aggro reducers on them. This means that if
they are resisted, they generate more aggro than they would if they landed
(because the reduction was resisted with the spell).

Though not essential to warriors, it is worth noting this for shaman slow
etc. Also, until recently nukes generated fixed aggro regardless of damage,
but now they have a damage component.
