Cheap upgrade suggestions are:

Fingers
Update your rings to get hit points.  Velium Fire Wedding Ring has AC:
+6 HP: +65.  Player made; check your bazaar.

Waist
A haste belt of some sort would be good.  
Flowing Black Silk Sash is from Lower Guk and runs about 900 to 1K on
my server.  
A low level haste belt drops in Hollowshade Moor off an owlbear you
might be able to solo.  
Another level 40 owlbear in Hollowshade drops Owlbear Feather Belt NO
DROP, weight: 1.0,  AC: +4 Wis: +4 Int: +4 Fire Resist: +4 HP: +10
Mana: +10 with a Piercing: +4% modifier.  
Another choice (no haste) is a spider fur belt.  It's usually fairly
cheap.  Stats for the spider fur are Weight: 0.0, AC: +10, Dex: +5,
Agi: +5, HP: +40.  
 
Arms
Giant Scalemail Sleeves are a minor upgrade in AC, HP, and WIS (AC:
+11, Wis: +3, Int: -3, HP: +20).  Usually fairly cheap on my server
even from npc merchants.  
Validus Custodus Plate Vambraces are Weight: 5.5, AC: +11 Str: +5 Agi:
-2 HP: +5.  Npc merchants are often fairly cheap for VC plate stuff.
 
Shoulder
Giant Scalemail Mantle is Weight: 4.4, AC: +6 Dex: +2 Fire Resist: +2
Disease Resist: +2 Cold Resist: +2 Magic Resist: +2 Poison Resist: +2
HP: +10 Mana: +10.  Another minor upgrade that's usually cheap. 
Validus Custodus Plate Pauldron is Weight: 3.5, AC: +11 Str: +5 Agi:
-2 HP: +5.  
 
Back
Giant Scalemail Cloak is Weight: 5.0, AC: +7 Sta: +5 HP: +30 Mana:
+10.  
Coterie General cape is Weight: 3.0, AC: +8 Str: +5 Int: +4 HP: +40.
Coterie generals are undead, Minimum Level: 44 Maximum Level: 46.
They also drop Coterie General Boots.

Boots
Coterie General Boots are Weight: 2.0, AC: +10 Str: +5 Agi: +4 Fire
Resist: -2 Disease Resist: +2 Poison Resist: +2 HP: +10.   

Wrist
Validus Custodus Plate Bracer is Weight: 3.0,  AC: +10 Str: +5 Agi: -2
HP: +4.  
 
Face 
Validus Custodus Plate Visor is Weight: 1.0, AC: +8 Str: +4 Agi: -2
HP: +4.  
 
Chest
Validus Custodus Plate Breastplate has the same AC but more HP.  Stats
are: Weight: 8.0, AC: +20 Str: +10 Agi: -5 HP: +15.  I've mentioned
severa items with Agility to make up for the agil loss on the VC plat
items.

Legs 
You might consider Validus Custodus Plate Greaves.  Stats are Weight:
6.5, AC: +13, Str: +6, Agi: -3, HP: +8.  

Range
Since you can pull with spells, ditch the bow and get a Goranga Idol.
Usually cheap and the stats are Weight: 0.1, AC: +8, Dex: +4, Sta: +3,
HP: +25.
