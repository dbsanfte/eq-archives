SIGHHHHH...

kit�ten (ktn)
n. 
A young cat. 

kit�ty2 (kt)
n. pl. kit�ties 
A cat, especially a kitten.

Kitten and Kitty are NOT adjectives.  If you said "cute Cat", THAT
would be an adjective, "cute" is modifying the noun "cat" and is
therefore an adjective.

pup�py (pp)
n. pl. pup�pies 
A young dog; a pup. 

Puppy is NOT an adjective.

ba�by (bb)
n. pl. ba�bies 

A very young child; an infant.  

Baby in this case (baby Jesus) is NOT an adjective.

Get a Dictionary and learn how to use it.
Either some people can't learn grammar or are just trolling, I guess
it's time for me to give up.
