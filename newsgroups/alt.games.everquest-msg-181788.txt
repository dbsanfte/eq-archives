Actually, you did assume by your own words. Here, let me refresh your
memory since it is clearly lacking:

Implications are obvious. Sorry, you weren't vague enough to use the
"I didn't say that!" backpedal when someone calls you on putting your
foot in your mouth.

And I said that you did....where?

Bravo. Good dodge. Now, respond to the statement.

Hmm, and you dump on me for "resorting to insults"? As you said "Pot.
Kettle".

>And you're *STILL* the only one complaining.

Not complaining != doesn't object/approves. Go away and buy that clue
before you come back this time.
