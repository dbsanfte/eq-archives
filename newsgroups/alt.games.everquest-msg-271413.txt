I don't have a wide experience with MMOGs, but in EQ1, I think you're 
talking about a relatively minor problem.

If you could only group with people your level, you'd have a point.  But 
instead the game allows you to group with a range of people, anywhere 
from about 2/3rds your level to about half again your level (I once had 
the actual ratios figured out, but its been a while), and wider range 
than that at the extreme low end.

At level 1 you can go out and get exp in groups up to level 6; think 
about it, that guy is 6 times your level!  If you're killing level 3 
mobs, two levels above your head and two beneath his, you can both get 
decent exp and both be useful.  But you could equally well choose to 
kill level 1 mobs, where he doesn't get any of the exp, or level 8 mobs 
where you're of no help at all; you get exp either way, learning from 
the seargent.  While your exp per kill is lower than it would be if 
grouped with someone the same level as yourself, your kill rate should 
be much higher, so you make up in volume what you lose in per kill.

At level 40 you can group up to 60, I recall that being a big turning 
point back when 60 was the highest level; you could group with almost 
anyone!  Again, depending on what content you pick, the high level may 
or may not be getting exp, but you will, and you may or may not be of 
any real help, but you will still get exp.

Salting a green unit with veterans is like salting some level 2s with a 
4 or 5, putting them in with a level 20 would be like grouping a bunch 
of privates's straight out of boot camp with a lieutenant; he's not 
really going to be a lot of help in what they need to know, which is how 
to keep their asses down while crawling from ditch to ditch.  They'd be 
better off paired with PFC's or maybe a corporal.

Having dismissed of two arguements, I'll grant you a third; its 
inconvenient to players to have restrictions on who they can group their 
characters with.  This is where the COH system I've seen described seems 
like an elegant solution; by sidekicking, they make it possible for 
anyone to group with their friends and be useful and meaningful, without 
being disporportionately rewarded.

Another idea might be to change the exp system, so that instead of 
giving you exp per kill, you instead get exp for what you contributed. 
Trouble is, thats hard to measure, as the best contributions the low 
level guy is going to provide are probably not in terms of hp damage 
done, but in heals or buffs or CC or single pulling... which is why the 
current system is fair, everyone is treated equally regardless of the 
type of contribution they made, and the more effective each person is, 
the better your kill rate so the better the exp pie thats being split up.

How about this; we stop giving generic exp, and instead set up a system 
whereby exp comes in different flavors based on level of mob; you need 
to kill 20 level 1 mobs to get to level 2, and 20 level 2 mobs to get to 
level 3, etc.  Group with a level 6 in order to take down level 6 mobs? 
  Great.  Kill 20 of them, you're still level 1.  But once you've hit 
level 6, ding, you're level 7, because you already have the 20 level 6 
kills under your belt.  Clearly this system would need a lot of tweaking 
to make it work, but perhaps there's something to the idea.
