While I firmly believe that many people take this game WAY to
serious and should maybe take a month off to get some fresh air.  I
have trouble thinking that $9.95 off of 4000+ people per server per
month isn't enough for operating costs that are at the cutting edge
and a nice profit too.  That is a fair amount of cash flow each
month.  (I don't have exact numbers does anyone here?)

That being said I am fairly happy with the game myself.  Do I think
there is room for improvement?  Yes, I think that everyone here does
even the Verant nut-swingers (though they may never admit it
publicly).
