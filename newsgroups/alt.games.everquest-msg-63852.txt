I'd recommend a Defiance( Lammy on steroids from Kael - about 10k on my
server), and venom axe (assuming its Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood- about
4-6k on my server), then just go camp yourself an FBSS or Sash of the
Dragonborn.
You could also do the part of the Garzicor quest to spawn the Ghost of
Burdael in Crystal Caverns and get an Onyxbrand off his corpse

Since you're going to Kael, and it sounds like you're your guilds MT, I
might go for some Cobalt, since you can most likely sell it after you get
some plate drops in Kael, or get your guild together in Icewell Keep and
kill dorfs at the entrance for some Velium, not as high AC as Cobalt, but
still good stuff.  If you take the path of spending cash on armor instead of
weapons, go ahead and buy the cheap pieces of Cobalt (in other words, no
bracers, BP or pants) and then sell them off as you get Thurg armor or
better.
