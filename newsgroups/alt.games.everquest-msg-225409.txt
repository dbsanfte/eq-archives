The only way it's gotten more group oriented is the grouping bonus. 
That's hardly a reason to create a new server. This would cater to a 
niche market, I agree. That niche market is just too small to warrant it, 
IMO.

Yet if they had known that the PvP server(s) you're referring to would be 
underpopulated so, you can bet they would have given their creation 
second thoughts, unless they view a low population as a benefit to the 
PvP aspect, of course. It's a different matter entirely to eliminate a 
server that people have already invested time on, than to decide against 
creating it in the first place.

Let's just agree to disagree here. :)
