i used to play everquest from 1999-2000
i lost the game in the divorce
i never did get much higher than level 30 cleric
i was all about having fun dabbling with newbies and hunting small stuff
i did get into some group kills near the end
i hear it has changed so much -
that with all the expansions and higher levels being a newbie is not as fun
as it was and hunting for bear pelts and baking just doesn't cut it?
what would you say to someone who was considering buying EQ again?
would i regret my purchase?
could i be contented with the low-key playing i am used to?
i can remember the day i had over 1000 plat in my stash...
is it all about uber now?
does anyone still help out the newbies?
