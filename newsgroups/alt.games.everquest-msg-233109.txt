Make yourself an "Assist" hotkey (/assist). Now you can target a mob
and, with one key press, switch to the player it is beating on. In
most cases the player with aggro will also have the mob targeted,
so this same key will toggle your focus back and forth between the
mob and the player which it's currently attacking.

Also, make a hotkey to /target the MA (main assist) in your group --
usually the tank. This requires that you edit the social at the start
of each group to add the MA's name after /target, but it's worth it. 

Now with two keystrokes you can target the MA and then the mob he's 
working on. This way you don't attack the wrong mob in a multi-pull 
and tick off your crowd controller by breaking mez.
