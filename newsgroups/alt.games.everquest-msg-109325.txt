Whether it's a nerf or not depends on your definition of nerf I suppose.
Me, I see it as fixing something that was wrong to begin with, and I don't
think of that as a nerf.  If I had a druid that had been hunting them, I
suppose I might feel differently about it.

They did make some mention a few patches back about correcting some issues
with some mobs not being correctly classified.  I think they mentioned some
specific mobs, and it did not include the ones in question here, but I'm too
lazy to search for the patch message.
