Well that's the thing, my rogue is level 11 and that last piece (Enraged 
Goblin Warbeads) would complete his set.  Took me a week or so to get 
him there playing casually.  Then I try this shaman and I've got the 
'rare' parts in six levels during one play session.  I'll have his 
newbie set complete after I get the iron ore tonight.  Ah well, if I 
really didn't like it I could hit the cancel button.
