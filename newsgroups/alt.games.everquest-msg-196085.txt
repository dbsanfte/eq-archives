    Yes, that's how the spell used to work. Then some clever shaman noticed
that the spell stayed on you even if you were OOM. The level 40's version
was powerful enough that at least one shaman, Alistair of our newsgroup,
claimed to have soloed a Plane of Hate? Fear? mob with it back when doing
such a thing seemed impossible. It was changed soon afterwards.
