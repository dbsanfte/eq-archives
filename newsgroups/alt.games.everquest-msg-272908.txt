Another big clue for you. Such things do happen in democracies. Look
up human history, partiacularly 1900 until about 1964, although it
still happened after that date. That you are so naive to think it
only happens in a dictatorship shows something. Or maybe you just
lack knowledge. It did happen, right in the U.S.

Next time some city wants your land for a road, and you don't want
to sell. Watch them take it. Its called Imminent Domain. Happens in
democracies. I've seen it happen.
