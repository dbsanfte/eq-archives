Regular maintenance != fixing. I don't neccessarily think that upgrading an
OS is preventative maintenance. More often than not, with MS products
(excepting XP, because it's rather well done), upgrading is a bigger
headache than anything.

As for "having" to upgrade, nope, I didn't. Nothing I currently play/use
requires anything better than what I already, with the exception of EQ. I
honestly don't care about 99% of computer games produced in the last three
years, as I don't like first-person shooters, or most realtime strategy
games. Give me Warcraft 2, C&C Gold, Deadlock (hell, this was made in '96
and it's still a great game), and Diablo 2, and I'm happy.

Is it really ignorance to believe that the system requirements on a game
should remain at least marginally the same, even in the case of something
that's dynamic like EQ? I don't think so. Personally, I think that those of
us who chose not to buy Luclin, aside from system reqs (I wasn't planning on
buying it until/unless I picked up a new machine anyway... I've still got
plenty I can do in old world/Kunark/Velious) shouldn't be punished for
choosing not to buy it, and that's basically what Verant's done. OS issues
aside, Verant also screwed everyone who didn't buy Luclin. How do you think
everyone who plays a bard felt, after Luclin went live, and found that their
class was completely and utterly unplayable? (Bards without songs =
completely useless, imo) That sort of thing, and a host of other problems,
affect folks who didn't want Luclin, didn't purchase Luclin, and don't
*intend* to purchase Luclin. I don't think it unreasonable that a customer
should expect quality service from a company that they patronize.

What do you think would happen if, for sake of arguement, 5% of AOL's
customers were told that their systems were no longer supported, 40% of them
could no longer connect at anything higher than 14.4k, 50% of them got
dropped randomly, couldn't connect, or had other weird performance issues,
but that final 5% were completely and totally satisfied, because their
machines were totally unaffected?

Beginning to see my point yet, or should I just quit wasting my time in
trying to explain it to you?

This is Verant's screw-up. Not Microsoft's, not the end user... Verant's.
