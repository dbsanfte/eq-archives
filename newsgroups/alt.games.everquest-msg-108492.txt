Well, as of a recent patch (and its supposed to be fixed soon) slow
is an enormous taunt... but no, barring that, even a slowing shaman
shouldn't get aggro in most encounters.  Enchanters, on the other hand,
deliberately place themselves highest on the hate list of most of the mobs
in an overpull, and inevitably the occaisional failed roll or early break
mez will get them their own invite to the party.  Shamen never -have- to
slow a mob in such a way as to draw aggro (broken aggro on slow aside)
except in rare encounters where damage will be so high that slow -must-
go in very early.

Yes, some shamen -do- draw a lot of aggro... but I said "supposed to"
draw a lot of aggro.  Wizzards are also not supposed to draw a lot
of aggro.  Funny how the KS mad ones seem to end up dead so often.
