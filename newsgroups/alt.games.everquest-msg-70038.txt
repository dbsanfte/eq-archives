No, am lvl 17, on Innoruuk. I've run through there a number of times camo'ed
and never had a problem. I was just wondering if anyone knew whether they'd
changed it even more drastically, like they did with Kithicor Woods. I ran
through there a few days ago, in the daytime, and still had to run for the
zone. Some high level undead -- he was red to me. There seem to be high
level undead things there through the daytime as well now.

Thanks for the advice, though.
