Some 'steps' are generic, yes.  For instance, a mage
HO will call for a nuke -- any other caster can nuke
there in their place, which triggers a different HO
with a different benefit.

There are also multi-'directional' HOs which can be
done in any order, as well as the routine ones which
must be followed step-by-step.

It's a fairly complex system - especially at the scout
"re-orient" level.
