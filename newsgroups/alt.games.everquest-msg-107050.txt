As a level 51 cleric, I wonder if this is more true for some classes
than others.  When I group with my guild, I get great exp but pickup
groups are usually rather slow.  I can't imagine being able to solo
level 45 mobs with ease at level 60, so I'm left with pickup groups
where the main tank may be level 52.  

I suspect I may be hunting in the wrong spots tho =)  

Also, I am grateful for  suggestions on static mobs that a cleric can
solo (preferably undead or casting type mobs that aren't in the
Feerrott ).  It's too bad that the skeletons in DL are starting to
"cyan out" at this level.
