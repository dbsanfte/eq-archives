Download version 1.39 or 1.41.  Get those port triggers out of there for
one, defeats the purpose.  USE DHCP and don't try to dynamically assign your
computers' IP addresses.  Also, hope you dont like running a server from
your house.  You need to be sure that you set your router to obtain an ip
address on the WAN, not statically assign it using the last IP you received
from Cox's DHCP server which was 68.98.51.129

This will normally solve your issues, while at the same time allowing the
firewall functions of the router to do their job.

If this doesnt work, then, welp.  Revert back to what you are doing now,
but, I would as others have, suggest you use a nice firewall program.
