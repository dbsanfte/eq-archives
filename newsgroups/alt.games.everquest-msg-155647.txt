Hmmn - I have yet to find a single source of food that doesn't cause the
aforementioned gaseous effect. Six years of eating 3 meals a day in a mess
hall left me with an unshakable habit of eating food at Mach 2.

I am normally finish my plate before other people have even made a noticable
effect on theirs. The results are of course, quite catastrophic gas-wise.

My best record to date has been clearing 3 flights (30'ish fellas each) and
the Band off the parade ground, but that was a Pizza and Corona Beer fueled
one which even made my own eyes water...

Rastus<----- 30 years old and still finds farts to be hilarious... well,
mine anyway.
