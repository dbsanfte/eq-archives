I have a character on Firiona Vie up to level 26 now. I have been
looking for the right guild for a little while now, so when a
groupmate invited me to join his small new guild (supposedly after
noting my skills), I thought what the heck, if it didn't work out, I'd
be no worse off. I mean, they seemed to care a bit about recruiting,
requiring multiple interviews and all. However, I'm beginning to
wonder if I was mistaken about not being any worse off now.

After just a couple of days, I am without a doubt behind where I could
have been had I continued soloing, having ding 26 three times now. I
have grouped exclusively during this time, always with at least some
guildmembers, once with the GL himself, and have had the following
experiences:

- Died in Runnyeye: trying to bail out a couple group members who saw
fit to run willy-nilly through the place looking for level 4. Evil
eyes rooted and wiped us out. Negative xp. Lost level. It happens, I
guess.

- Died again in Runnyeye: overpull, plain and simple. Negative xp.
Lost level. It happens, frequently, it seems.

- Fell victim to loot whore: fighting evil eyes in Gorge of King
Xorbb, one group member pounced on the first three corpses, looting
gems and such. I kill a wandering muddite and she tells me she needs
the page I looted from it. I say "Oh, sorry, I thought maybe I could
jump in for some loot at some point." She declined to comment. Minute
xp. Bad first impression of two guildies.

- Sat for hours in a terribly over-camped HHK in a group which
included guild leader. Bad xp grinding experience there, but I was
invited to join them, so I tried it. Someone there should have known
better. Couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. Still looking
for that favorable guild representation...

Normally, I wouldn't form opinions after so short a time, but all this
combined with the sophomoric IRC-like guild chat is wearing me down
quickly.

Like I said, not much point to this post, but if there are any
discriminating mid-level and higher guilds out there who would be
interested in talking about it and maybe grouping a bit, let me know.
