Yeah, I thought of that after I'd posted the first bit shown above.
Indeed, after maxing out Fishing on my toon that actually uses the
skill occasionally, a couple nights ago I sent another toon over to
Abysmal, figuring I might as well have him learn to fish too, and
make a few plat while I did.  Only spent a half hour or so, got up
to a whopping skill 5 (hadn't bothered to fetch my WIS gear), camped.
Didn't run him at all last night.  And now there doesn't seem much
point to continuing to skill up in fishing with him.  Sigh.

(I did have another reason to send him to the boat, though.  The
brewing-supply merchants there have all the ingredients in one place
for making some useful skill-up beverages.  So I guess the money I
paid for GoD isn't a total loss.  Not quite.)
