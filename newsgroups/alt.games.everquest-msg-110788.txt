I seriously doubt Mr. Reagan had enough material upstairs to 
"understand" Communism. On the other hand, I will admit he could go as 
far as "let's make more missiles than them", which did cause the Soviet 
Union to put more resources into its military than it could afford.

Ultimately, though, what brought the USSR down wasn't the missile gap, 
but the washing machine gap, the fridge gap, the games console gap, the 
computer gap and so on. Communism failed spectacularly at making the sort 
of consumer goods that people crave... And at the end, when people 
withdrew their support, the regime simply self-destructed.

Where do you get your information on Europe from, 'Guns & Ammo'? While I 
have all the respect in the world for the lavishly consumerist lifestyle 
of the US (I throughly enjoyed the years I lived in California, and I'd 
live again there in a heartbeat), there is nothing wrong with EU economic 
policy, it just has different priorities than that of the US, and it has 
to cater to different social demands. Perhaps pure 'laissez faire' 
capitalism is the most efficient economic model there is, but there are 
considerations other than pure efficiency.
