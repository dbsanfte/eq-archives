The *goblins*, yes there were more mobs in BB than aqua goblins,  on the
other hand have not been nerfed and frequently drop green goblin blood AND
heads, for a 9plat loot, and now with ldon you have a soulbinder in between
the two main camps, along with merchants that evil characters can use,
although a lot of high levels nip over and kill goblins while waiting for
their adventure.
