Try been a cleric it is just as bad for resses.
gave a res to a over 50 monk didn';t even get a thank you another time
someone was offering pp for a res,
I res he's friend he gives 9pp i say keep it you need it more than me and
don't ask for a res again.
Being a cleric can be just as bad as a druid or wizzy.
