I don't understand it myself. It annoys the hell out of me, too. I
always reject such invites, and sometimes even make the effort to tell
them exactly why I'm rejecting.  If they can't be bothered to even say
"hi", why the hell would I want to group with them? Especially when
I'm level 3 plugging away in the newbie yard...not worth it to group
that low.
