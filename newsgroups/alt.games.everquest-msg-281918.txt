A big difference here, the grids used by D&D were of a known scale, and
anyone with even a mediocre understanding of maps and scales knew how
to properly recalculate for 1 graph paper square = 10 ft. to 1 graph
paper square = 100 ft.

Also, I don't know about the D&D games you played, but all campaigns I
participated in were generally lmited to one play group where time
passed as was convenient for the story :). I tried once to do the whole
"move the party markers ever 10 seconds" thing with outdoor maps.
Didn't work. Playing that way with pen & paper RPGs is just silly.

I'm also not thinking of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Alaska in terms
of inches across, but rather miles across. The maps are to scale, but
not to scale with each other. This is known, and as such, you can
measure the maps, use the scale in the map, and re-figure the maps
accordingly. The maps are merely partial representations of the
location in question, I'm not walking across the map. Unless it's one
of those big novelty maps, but even still I'm not considering the map
of Colorodo in the Denver airport to BE Colorodo.

Conversely, the maps of everquest ARE the locations, with distances
measured in constant yet unspecified units. If I have a move of 5, I
move 5 units per one unit of time. By having what 5 units of distance
is different per zone, you make the size of that characters stride
different per zone.

Not only that, but the angles you need to get the distances where that
10' ceiling would make a difference also neccessarily negate any
accuracy you might have had with a bow. Shooting at an indoor archery
range with an 8' or 10' ceiling does nothing to the bows range, so even
that's a load. And as you state, that still shouldn't affect spell
ranges unless spells also follow arced trajectories similar to arrows
and slings.

Sounds like your play style of 1st edition D&D was more interesting
than mine :)

Again, this has more to do with the scale of the map, rather than any
observed real-world (such as it is) distances. If the outdoor map used
a scale of 1" = 100', that gives the indoor map of 1" = 10' ten inches
to play with; too small, yes, but that could be accounted for by
outdoor map inaccuracies, and the imaginary cartographers odd desire to
keep everything to a 1" grid, even though some structures should take
up parts of a grid. Now, if you were to take that same map, and apply
it to a real-world environment where you could physically walk around
it, and kept it to the exact measurements in the game, you'd run into
problems. That's essentially what these 3D computer games allow us to
do, and we encounter these 4+ dimentional structures.

Except that the grid size in D&D (and any other RPG or war game that
uses grid maps) is representative of a known unit of measure, most
often the foot or meter. EverQuest measures everything in a generic,
universal unit of measure. I could scale maps of those areas as I saw
fit, but the universal unit of measurement should be consistant across
all zones.

Thought of this, and the answer was "no"

I did and still no. Most zone lines place you within a few units of a
location geometrically similar if not identical to where the previous
zone line left off.

Also, with indoor zones scaled oddly as they are, you actually get the
feeling of moving FASTER in most of them, not slower. If one were to
scale the Cabilis zones such that they fit better with Swamp, Warsliks,
and FoB, they would no longer line up with eachother. Lake of Ill Omen
still doesn't fit, no matter how much you scale, because the corridor
from Cabilis to the lake itself is far longer than any of the other
zones. By scaling, you either get it to fit in with Firiona Vie XOR
Cabilis XOR Frontier Mountains, but never any two, much less all three.

I actually have a really nice file which I would be happy to e-mail to
anyone interested. It's in PCX format (GNU Image Manipulation Program
format), but I can convert to most any format, including Photo Shop.
It's a grey-scale height-map of the zones, with each zone being its own
layer. On some mythical date when I have time again, I would like to do
the rest of Norrath, but for now I only have Kunark.
