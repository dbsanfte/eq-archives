I bought NWN a couple nights ago and have played it some.  I've learned most
of the basics, but that's about it.  I've probably only spent an hour or so
actually PLAYING the game (after the tutorial) and I'm not yet hooked.  My
gnome looks like a small human...VERY disappointing.  I've yet to see what
others are raving about...but then again, I generally find D&D (as in AD&D)
extremely boring, so perhaps I'm not the best judge.

Guild activity is about at the same level as before, though many are
fiddling with NWN.

Never heard of Morrowind.
