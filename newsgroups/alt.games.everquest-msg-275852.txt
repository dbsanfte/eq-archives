if your mouse is working in windows then it won't change when EQ2 loads up 
... do you have a firewall installed? could be that the everquest.exe file 
has been updated and your firewall is waiting for a response behind the EQ2 
screen.

While it's loading up, before you get to the character select, screen press 
Alt-Enter to switch EQ2 to windowed mode and you'll be able to see what's 
happening behind the scenes. To get back to full screen just press Alt-Enter 
again.
