Yeah, seeing all those epic mages summoning their epic will
really spam everyone...  ;p

(The change just adds a message when the mage summons their
Orb...)

Yes, it seems to help against Slows once they added the
disease component.

It's a HUGE change for any upper-level mage with half-way decent
resists.  Even having the spell check be against the mage's level
instead of the pet's will make a MAJOR difference.  This change
along with the other, recent changes (no mez breaking, no trains,
etc.) makes mages a LOT more viable in dungeons after the recent
NPC caster changes.

I'd hope so but the "real" benefit will be seeing if it managed
to get Slow'd or rooted or whatever...

That AAXP is Hate reduction (5, 10, 20%) on offensive spells.
So that wizard can go Boom! earlier w/o getting smeared all over
the floor...  No idea which ones were broken.

Being "group bugged" has little impact on game play; you /camp
and clear it.  Now it shouldn't happen anymore.  It'll be a nice
reduction in simple aggravation, though, if it works.  Nothing
quite like a porter, for instance, having the portee disband
while they're loading and having to /camp to get someone else,
etc etc etc...

Okay, I'd like to hear that.  I can't think of any situation
where it'll make any difference.
