Heh, I never bothered to get that spell, and I know few druids who do. Still,
if you have the, what, two or three gold you need to buy this spell, it would
be worth it for practice.

FWIW, though, it is rather amusing to sit at the gate of a city and start up
conversations with people who are invisible. Even better is sowing them as they
run by. Once, I darn near made an Iksar necro pee his robe doing that :-P Hey,
just because I'm practicing spells doesn't mean I can't have a bit of fun.
