Yes, back when EQ was released, you should have told yourself to wait
because EQ2 would one day be released and you wouldn't want to waste all
that invested time.

And you're right, I shouldn't have spent all that time playing Diablo
because since Diablo 2 came out I haven't played the first one at all, look
at all that wasted time! The same for Fallout and Baldur's Gate. Maybe I
shouldn't play any computer games at all, because in a year there will be a
better one to play anyway.
