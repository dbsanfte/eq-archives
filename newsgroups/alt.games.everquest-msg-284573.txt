	I don't think that works because the cleric stuns are all on 2
timers, so at the most you can cast 1 of each of the 2 stun lines per
fight except that one line - the line that does damage - gets resisted
so much it's not worth meming :-)

	There are, but it is rare.

	I dunno about bards but doesn't your typical high-level warrior
quad for like 150? Plus kicks and their own proc.  And paladins put
out more dps than warriors do unless I'm mistaken.  I didn't know a cleric
could put out that much.  I mean, I have seen them soloing...but very 
patiently :-)

>You passed over Lull

	Yes, you're right, I remember clerics pulling (or lulling for the 
puller)but haven't seen one do it in a while.  Isn't there something different 
about the level 70 cleric lull that makes it work differently (and of course 
not as well) as the ones that came before?

>Faeandar skipped Fear

	Fear, blech, I hate fear.  As far as I'm concerned they should 
rename Fear to "Please allow us to run after you for 10 minutes and use
up all our mana getting you down to 5% so you can run over to those mobs
we thought you'd never run over to and train us".

	Does atone actually work???  I was somehow under the impression
that it didn't actually work reliably enough to make bixies forgive you
never mind something with teeth :-)

	Sure there is, clerics get a new one at like 67 or 68 plus an
AA for another IMHO useless flying hammer.

>high end game

	Probably.  Although I have a level 7 wizard hanging 
around somewhere :-)
