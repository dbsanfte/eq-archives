Pretty accurate, but...
I've seen Rubi BPs for sale several times.  They are a bit overpriced,
due to rarity and unique look, but not too outrageous.  Also, a year
(or maybe two years? dunno, the "old days" tend to blur together),
there were a couple of days when GMs spawned some mobs in Najena
that dropped pieces of Rubicite (if you checked out the comic somebody
linked with the "GM Event" bit in it, you can imagine what happened).
I don't know if the Najena thing was an all servers event, or only on
some/all of the newer servers (I was active on Lanys when it happened,
heard about it on one or two others).
