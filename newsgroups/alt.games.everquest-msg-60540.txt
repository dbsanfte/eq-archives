  You know... This Linux is a Server line is a little weak as far as I'm
concerned. Especially considering that in the Computer world of today with
Broadband connections, internet file sharing and the like.... Shouldn't we
be moving to a more or less server oriented OS. Better stability, better
safty features built in and well... designed for the net.
  It's not the OS thats the problem. Well not usually, The Beast of Redmond
has even moved to (from my thinking and limited knowledge) a more Server
oriented scheme with XP. Not the best example I know but still.
  It is the Hardware manufacturers.... almost completly. If they would free
up their specs to let "Volunteers" do the work whats it to them.
  You join some sort of  "ATI Volunteer Driver Corps". The Corps does the
work for free for the Driver submits it to ATI or however for final testing
and approval and Voila! It's not really that simple but basically it's very
feasible when you think about it. Everyone gets the Drivers for the OS of
their choice... Fully sanctioned by the maker, the developers get their name
in lights and new markets open up for the Manufacturer.
  I'm sure some enterprising programmer could come up with a valid plan to
send to the Hardware folks, or even (gasp and shudder) the Beast itself. If
it makes COM available why not the rest... (Alas, it will never happen). And
if DX uses COM for the most part would it be hard to find a work around for
the rest of it, a more native Linux fix?
  And lets not forget... Linux started out as a desktop application. A
little terminal emulater so Linus could read Usenet on his 386... Another
gross over-simplification but a valid point I think.
  I'm sure all this nonsense is getting tiring but I for one am enjoying the
answers and even leaning some stuff and thats the point in the end. Isn't
it?
