I believe it's more likely to be a 'feature'. If you screw up zoning you
get moved to the zone safe spot instead of appearing just over the zone
line (ever zoned out of Highhold into Kithicor and appeared at
Rivervale?). Probably in S Qeynos and Erud's crossing, the safe spot is
on the dock. Chances are you took to long to zone so the boat had
already moved off when you appeared. It's actually quite considerate of
them to drop you on the dock rather than in the middle of the open
sea...
