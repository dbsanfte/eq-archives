Melee is not tradeskilling.  Show me a log with a weapon skill-up
that did not coincide with a hit (hitting a damage absorbing buff
and doing zero damage counts as a hit).  Unless they have changed
things recently you simply cannot do it.

I skilled up Kaev's piercing from 30ish to over 160 solo in LGuk.
With a 100ish DEX this took a fair bit of time.  Until my skill
passed 100 or so I had FAR more misses than hits.  Every single
one of those 130 or so skill-ups came on a hit.  Every one.
Without exception.

Conditionally true, the condition being that you must hit them as
frequently (or very nearly as frequently) as you hit blue mobs
(which can often be arranged via buffs/debuffs unless your weapon
skill is exceedingly poor).
