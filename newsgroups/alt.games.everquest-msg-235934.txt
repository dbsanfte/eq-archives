SOE actually stated in the fine print on the Discord box that the
game's content was subject to change. That pretty much covers them
legally for bug fixes that could be viewed as "nerfs". Anyone with
experience in online gaming should know that things like this are
entirely possible. SOE advertised a tribute system. What they did NOT
advertise, however, were the tribute values.

I've gotta watch more of FMA myself. I saw a couple episodes at a
friend's house, but have been too lazy to look for more. Too busy
looking for the rest of Inuyasha. ^_^
