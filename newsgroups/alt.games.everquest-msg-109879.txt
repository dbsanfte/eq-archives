DT, I simply can't understand what makes you believe that statement
contradicts me.  To break it down:
you say:  "fitness" refers to best suited for survival
I ask:  how are you going to measure "best suited for survival" in any
way other than by observing which are the survivors?  (clue: you can't)
I then ask:  how then does your statement allow me distinguish
"survival of the fittest" from "survival of the survivors"?
In conclusion:  "survival of the fittest" has no use other than as a
clumsy way to provide one possible definition of "fitness"

Yes, I know, I led myself to concluding that it's almost useless,
instead of just useless.  Oh well, it's still not any sort of
"scientific principle".
