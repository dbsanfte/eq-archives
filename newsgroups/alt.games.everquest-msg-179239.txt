Not quite.

In the beginning, there was the 8-slot Large Sewing Kit.  It was lightweight
(not zero weight, but less than the 10-slot tailored bags) and held
giant-sized items.  This make it popular with monks who needed something
lightweight to hold their stuff.  This was also back in the day when hitting
combine would eat the stuff in the kit if it wasn't a valid recipe.  If you
accidentally hit combine, you'd destroy all your stuff.

Then Verant introduced 10-item recipes, and expanded the 8-slot kits to
10-slot kits.  They also made it so that stuff wouldn't get eaten if you
accidentally hit combine.  I seem to remember that the upped the weight
quite a bit too, which caused a ruckus in the monk community.

Suddenly, the market for 10-slot backpacks dried up.  The new kits were
perfect for bank storage.  Why pay 100pp for a 10-slot backpack that
couldn't hold giant items when you could buy something from a vendor for
2pp?

The tailoring community screamed.  At the time, this was the top-end
tailored item, and what many tailors used to make money with.

Verant listened.  But they couldn't just reduce the number of slots back to
8 - hundreds of people had the things in the bank, and changing the number
of slots would destroy the items stored in the deleted slots.

So they renamed the 10-slot to "Deluxe Sewing Kit", removed it from the
vendors, and replaced it with a new 8-slot "Large Sewing Kit".

The existing Deluxe kits are leftovers from that time.

I don't seriously think anyone would pay 1000pp for one.  New ones aren't
entering the game, but there are so many of them out there being used as
bank storage.  You could probably get 100pp, though.
