I have 2 accounts and would like to start making better use of the
second one. What are the best combinations of characters that require
the least amount of moving from computer to computer?

I currently have a warrior/cleric combo that works very well. I
suppose a chanter/caster combo would work well even if all the chanter
did was breeze/clarity. Druid/necro combo looks like it would require
lots of running back and forth.

My desire is not to PL but to partner 2 characters of the same lvl's.
Any advice or suggestions?
