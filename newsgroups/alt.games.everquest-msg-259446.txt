My personal story, fwiw...I originally played EQ on at&t@home cable.  I
finally quit in disgust because the latencies were HORRIFIC.  We had logs
of these random and sudden outages, we even got their tech support to
confirm the spikes while on the phone with us, but the end result was that
they felt it was acceptable.

Maybe so for someone browsing the internet, but not for an online game
player.

So my recommendation is that for anyone in Marin or Sonoma Counties of
california to steer clear of the local cable company (comcast I assume it
is now). Maybe they've improved their policies since then, and I'm fairly
certain that if we'd lived in some other part of town the problem wouldn't
have been there, but I personally will never take that risk again.  The
broadband company a gamer goes with needs to be one that doesn't believe
that sporadic but constant terribly latencies are "acceptable".
