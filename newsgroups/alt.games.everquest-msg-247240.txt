I know a lot of players who want specific LDoN merchant items that must 
be bought with AP. So every hour not doing an LDoN is an hour where 
they'll still have to go do an LDoN later. (Admittedly at 20-30th level 
where you aren't making enough points to make it even worthwhile this 
doesn't hold... but around 40-50, and definately past 50th...
