Can't remember if it was Socrates that said ~"An unexamined life is not
worth living."

I suspect a large part of the original intent of making travel difficult was
to force people into forming local communitees.

With twinking the dash to level 5 is less then an hour. Different playtimes
mean that character you were teaming with 5 levels ago is either 5 levels
ahead of you or 5 levels behind. I don't think it quite worked out as
planned.

Last night there was a level 4 high elf cleric in GF shouting for a teleport
to Freeport. I was jerking around with my ranger<again>, so after about 20
minutes of hearing these shouts and w/o SoW I just started hoofing it to
Freeport.

I'm doing /w all lowlevcleric and saying to myself "I'm in Butcher Block and
he is still in GF", "I'm in OOT and he is still in GF". I got off the boat
to run some errands in OOT, but checked a level 11 bard that was on the boat
with me and he was in ECommons while lowlevcleric was still in GF. I finally
jumped back on another boat and sure enough, I'm in EFP and lowlevcleric is
still in GF.

I'm sure the intended effect of difficult travel was to have some low level
whining little idiot shouting across a zone for an hour to get a free ride
to Freeport. Time for a another evaluation of intentions vs results I think.
I mean sheesh! He would have had to run from the Druid Ring in WC to EC to
WFP anyway vs GF to BB then jump a boat.

But then I am probably too conservative relative to other people. AFAIAC,
you shouldn't be able to change your bind point for 8 levels and SoW
shouldn't stick to you. I think you should get a max of 5 shouts an hour,
after that you get a sys message "You are to friggin horse to shout again."
At least modifications like that would cut down on the abuse of the shout
channel and I can filter /ooc and /idiot w/o losing shout.
