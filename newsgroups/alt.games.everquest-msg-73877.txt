Perhaps on your server.  On MT the going rate is still in the 4k to 5k
range.  And I purchased them for 4k not so long ago when 8k was still
solid.  I simply dont feel they are appropriate for my level, and as
such wont take advantage of the AC.

Tell that to a gentleman named Phan on MT who as a 12th level warrior
purchased a bow from me wearing full Cobalt, carrying a Lammy and a
shield I cant recall.  With all that AC and that speed, you arent
getting hit nearly as hard and nearly as often.

"As many would have you think"???  "I" am the one who believes it is
wrong, I am not being pushed into this belief,  this is my own
personal view.
