More than likely it's because <most> of the "spoilers" here are pretty 
well know to someone who's played for a while. Also, most information is 
pretty abundant on the web - e.g. Allakhazam's etc. EQ doesn't have any 
"puzzles" per se and so information here is not really a "spoiler". 
That's just my opinion.
