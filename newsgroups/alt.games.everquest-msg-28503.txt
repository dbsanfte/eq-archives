I don't know if it's any consolation, but in a later section of that Ask
Brad column, a different player wrote in asking if they were going to
start doing more polls at the log-in screen like they were for a while.
I'm too lazy to go pull it out again word for word, but the basic answer
was that they had "run out of questions" and were looking for input from
the player base as to new questions/polls they could put up on the
log-in screen. You (and anyone else here interested) may want to go
visit the Developer's Forum on the home page and put in this and other
questions that you'd like to see them get some player input on.
  Not saying that will actually help anything, but you never know.
