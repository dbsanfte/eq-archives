I'm with Ben on this one because I was one of those players who voted with
their feet and I can tell you exactly why I left. The presence of
non-consensual PvP was not the issue. Indeed, it's one of the things that
added an exciting level of tension to the game. But the implementation
within UO was horrible and full of exploitability and sheer grief potential
that made it decidedly not-fun.

Let me offer up one example of a common exploit. In UO there were PVP-free
zones and PVP-active zones. "Zone" conjures up the wrong image here, think
of them as legislative districts jerrymandered up by the most insidious
legislative griefers, with completely unpredictable (but determinable) zone
lines. If an attack on a player was conducted in a PvP-active zone, no legal
consequences would attach other than giving the victim the right to attack
you back and retain this hate for some time. If a PvP attack were conducted
in a PvP-free zone, the victim had only to shout "Guard!" and guards would
poof out of nowhere and insta-kill the assailant. This purported to protect
innocent victims traveling through designated safe spots. Here's how it
worked in practice:

Victim, a well-equipped uber Warrior on a steed, is traveling just outside
of town, stopping to inspect several vendors nearby. Griefer, a female rogue
outfitted in a pink dress with a shepherd's crook and lambs following her,
knows the zone boundaries like the back of her hand and walks up to the
mighty warrior and overtly picks his pocket, stealing maybe a small spell
reagent or other inconsquential item. The victim sees this and yells
"Guard!" believing himself to be in a safe zone. No guards appear. This
tells the victim that he's in fact in a pvp-active zone, so he pulls out his
uber weapons of destruction and prepares to unleash a wave of attacks on the
griefer. The griefer, meanwhile, takes two steps to the left and stands now
in what is actually a PvP-free zone and when the victim attacks, griefer
shouts "Guards" and watches in glee while the victim is guard killed.
Griefer then completely loots the victim of EVERYTHING on his corpse and
then cheerfully leads her flock on to the next victim.

And that's just one example. It happened to me once when I was traveling
with my son outside of Moonglow and I watched MANY variations on this theme
happen after that. After enough of that kind of "PvP", you just say "enough,
I'm tired of trying to figure out this ruleset. I'm outta here".

Trust me, it's not just the presence of non-consensual pvp. The DAoC numbers
indicate that there *is* a compelling market for PvP that works well. Having
played PvP in UO, EQ, AC, AO, DAoC and SWG, it's my opinion that no one has
yet designed an optimal system for it, although DAoC came the closest. I
still remember the rush I enjoyed traveling with my guild out in DAoC's
Frontier (pvp-active). We had a cause, we had an enemy, and we had tools.
It's a fundamentally different experience than EQ, I don't see that it makes
much sense to contrast these two, I don't buy the carebear criticism, it's a
false dichotomy. I enjoy them both, for different reasons. Both provide
tension in their own way, and both have their markets.

The real issue, pointed out by both Ben and the author cited, is that we
haven't seen an optimal implementation yet for PvP. This is largely because
of the fallout from Little Miss Bopeep above. People either remember what is
what like in those pioneering days of griefing PvP, or they've heard the
horror stories and they opt out without much further thought. The fact that
so many companies are still *trying* to get PvP right is a good sign, and I
hope leads to some creative new efforts.
