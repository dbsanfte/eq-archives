I think it is great that not every player will be an 'uber guilder - 'ooh 
look at me, no I am not jealous of your new cloak' person.

All my guilds in AC1, AC2 and Horizons were very casual player friendly and 
usually delighted to see the character log on. the problem with hunting and 
xp sharing and quest was often sorted by using a suitable alt character. 
Plus you will get some good gear given to you  )

My personal view of a guild is Friendly, Fun, Helpful and Freedom ( but not 
lacking maturity )
