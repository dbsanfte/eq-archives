I was looking for the keyboard code for remote access to Tribute.  I 
searched through the FAQ using the computer search tool and did locate 
references to the origin of the Tribute system and the later expansion to 
guild tribute.  However, I could not find the answer to my question.  Nor, 
could I find it on the eqplayers (Sony) database.  Finally I found it on 
Allakhazam.

Point:  If details on Tribute are in FAQ I could not find them.
Point:  If the information is not there, perhaps that would be something to 
add.
