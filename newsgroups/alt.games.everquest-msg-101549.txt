The file you refer to is on my pc in the following location:

I play with two pc's, one is an Athlon 1900+ with 1.5 gigabytes of RAM and
GeForce3 (plays like a dream) the other is the original machine I played EQ
on, a Celeron 433 with 512 MB RAM and GeForce2 64MB PCI Video card (only
upgrade to machine thus far)  which also plays great (MINOR lag).  I would
say upgrade to at least a 64MB card (if you have AGI slot use it) the
GeForce cards are very inexpensive for what they deliver (saw a GeForce 4
64MB PCI card at best buy for $115 on Saturday.)  Also, I would recommend
spending the money to upgrade the RAM to about 512MB or so.  checkout
www.pricewatch.com for prices on RAM...think it is about $50 for a 256 MB
stick now for pc133

Yes, xp is a good program, like it very much
