 "/inspect off". Try it. Also, there is no message that tells the 
person you inadvertantly inspected that you "clicked it off". As
far as they know you can be inspecting for several minutes if 
neither of you move. And who cares what "information" they got
from inspection? What information? The names of the items you
are wearing? So what?
 
 Also... "noone" is not a word, at least not in the English language.
