Yes, that's an irritating "feature" of auto-join (I'm pretty sure it's
intentional).  Especially that it is common across servers.  There are
two solutions I know of:  (1) take advantage of how cheap hard disk
space is these days and make a separate EQ directory for each character
(drawback: gotta patch each installation), or (2) instead of using
autojoin make a join macro for each character and hit it when you log
in (drawback: you have to remember to hit the button).

I'm pretty sure it was intentional, though not very well thought out.
Players who want to autojoin their "friends" channel with all of their
characters get a one-time savings of a few keystrokes, but everybody
else has the hassle of implementing some workaround.  The usual sort
of short-sightedness you see with the default settings for new features
in many applications.
