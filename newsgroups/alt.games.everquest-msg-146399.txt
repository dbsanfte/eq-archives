I had quit on both accounts, and I am not going back either. You don't
"accidently" shove a halberd up someones ass and then take it out 3 days
later and expect them to be happy with you again. Intent has been shown and
I wouldn't send another dollar their way if I got a free fireblanket out of
the deal when my dick was on fire.

One thing to note, is that their favorite $$$ machine aka "Stormhammer" is
almost exclusively a 50+ server playerbase wise. I bet the subscription base
graph on that server in particular caught the attention of a suit or two.
