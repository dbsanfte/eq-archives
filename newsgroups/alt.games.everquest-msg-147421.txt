   I don't know much (anything) about DT's personal life, and really,
I'm not what you could call his biggest fan.  But  I think it's a bit,
well, myopic of you to imply that if someone hasn't served in the
miliary, they haven't done anything for thier country.  Maybe DT has a
job.  Maybe he pays taxes to go to supporting the military.  Maybe he
buys a paper once in a while, helping to support the Free Press.  Maybe
he votes.  Maybe he just goes about his petty little comfortable life,
speaking freely against the government when he wants to, doing the
things that most Americans do every day that build our way of life.
   I don't really enjoy being in the position of siding with DT.  He
often seems to me to be a querulous little twit.  However, Larry, you
seem to be even more of a twit.
    I am a veteran of the US Army, and I am married to a man that spent
23 years in the Army and Navy, some of it in  the Gulf.  We were
separated for over 5 years of our 16 year happy marriage because of his
military obligation.   But this doesn't make me a "better" American than
someone who hasn't personally sacrificed anything for the defense of
this country.  And it does NOT make my opinions of 9/11 any more valid,
either.
   Just for the record, I'm glad that there was no message in the MoTD. 
We all know it happened.  Most of us cried.  We all felt the pain.  No
one in this country really needed to be reminded what day it is, because
no one has forgotten for a second what happened.  Nor shall we forget. 
And we sure as hell don't need a message in the MoTD to remind us. I go
to Norrath to escape from my boring, sometimes dreary, life.  I applaud
Verant for making the decision to not let the ugly, grim reality of 9/11
intrude on their little, made-up world.  
   Keep bitching if you want to, Larry.  You have the right.  But
everyone reading also has the right to tell you how stupid you sound to
the majority of us.  Whether we are veterans or not.
 
   Lenny is also posting a reply to this message.  I doubt that it will
be very comprehensible.  But rest assured, although he has spent most of
his adult life in the service of his country, he does not agree with
you.

Annie <--- Not really expecting DT to thank her for siding with him, for
some reason....
