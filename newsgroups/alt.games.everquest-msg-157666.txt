Oh dear the music's changed?? I *liked* the music the way it was!

MIDI/synthesized music is *much* better for games than digitised music 
such as CD audio and MP3. The main reason being that you can change the 
tempo, instruments etc on the fly according to what is happening in the 
game. Digitised music is too static and it also chews up more resources.
