56 Barb Shammy here on Solusek Ro.  PoF is the next stop on my epic to
get the Tear.  I've read up on several sites looking for strategy
specific to this goal but can't seem to find much in the way of
details.  Most guides are geared toward clearing the whole zone.  I'm
looking for details.

I have never been to Fear and would like some ideas on what strategy,
size of force, etc... I will need to gather to get the tear.  Anyone
with experience in this quest who has ideas would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you
