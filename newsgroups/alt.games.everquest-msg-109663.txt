I'm probably going to get to 58 faster because of that death, because
it put me in a severe grinding mood, and 7 days of doing that should
ding me.

Heh. I looked at my logs and saw that I did last long enough that I
could have egressed if I'd channeled through hits, but being summoned
like that took me completely by surprise (I hadn't touched the mob
since debuffing semi-early in the fight). I barely had time to finish
going 'huh' before dying, and when I popped up at bind point, the
others were being trasked as well. Three of us lost exp altogether,
one being our puller/corpse dragger, who complained that if she'd only
had a little more health and mana, she could have gotten the two last
corpses before the repops that ended up screwing us over.
Speaking of aggro, I got Ro's smouldering disjunction last night, so
now I am going to have to learn how long to wait before casting that
one. Testing it on one of the beastlord epic mobs last night proved
such an efficient way of gaining aggro that the shaman with us
wondered if I had done something stupid like casting epic on it :)
