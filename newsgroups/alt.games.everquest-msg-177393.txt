    There's one necromancer on my server that has his level 65 undead charm
spell. He gets one AA point per 12 to 15 minutes in Crypt of Decay. He's
made 100 AA's this week, the first week since he got it. If you're going to
go after charm because it's not balanced, you have to go after everyone.

    Personally, I don't see it as out of whack. I've grouped with enchanters
using nasty charmed stuff in PoP, and I see what they have to do to avoid
being smeared. I've also done charm soloing with my enchanter at lower
levels, and seen how much faster charm XP always was. Given how fast AA's
come today anyways, the AA times for a solo enchanter aren't out of whack.
If there's problems with specific encounters (like those slow-to-regen BoT
bosses), then tune the encounter, not the ability. /shrug.

    James
