I'll just give my point of vue about this KEI case, not as a EQ player, but
as an experienced pen&paper RPG designer.

Is KEI enjoyable ? ofc it is! who wouldn't like to be more efficient in
spellcasting.
Is KEI power playing ? ofc it is too. It's a very high level buff so I
believe EQ designers intended it for very high level players. Imho buffing
low or mid levels players with KEI is nothing more than twinking. It's quite
like giving some dreadfull gear or weapons to a player that can't afford or
fetch it by self at the sole exception that the buff will disapear after
some time. The problem seems to be "is twinking/powerleveling a good thing
to everquest or not ?", imo it's never a good option ; playing first person
shooter games in god mode have always been the best way to get bored from
the game...
I've seen too much n00bz begging for high level buffs to play (not only KEI,
but SoW and more), those kind of players that never played unbuffed make
awfull mid-level characters players and are a pain.
According KEI to be a high level buff intended to high level players i
believe that it could be easily nerfed in a way that the duration of the
spell would be factor of the level of the receiver. I.e.: a KEI would last
level * 2 mins, so a 60th level character will enjoy a 2 hours buff while on
a 2nd level character it will be fading within the 5 first minutes making it
quite unuseable for too lower level characters.
