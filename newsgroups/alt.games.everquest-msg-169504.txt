Note that this means you die on the *ninth* cycle if you start at full HP.
You'll regen one (or more) HP when the tick lands while you're busy
drowning.

This actually happened to me yesterday. I started drowning and activated
a waterstone after the eighth cycle. My HP bar *looked* empty. Another
cleric hit me with a CHeal immediately thereafter.

(One member of my group drowned *twice* because she was relying on EB
rather than using the waterstones our mage was handing out at regular
intervals. In both cases we weren't even in combat.)
