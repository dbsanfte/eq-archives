Your Voodoo2 card can't be in the AGP slot. Voodoo2's are PCI only cards. 
If I remember correctly, Quantum3D did make a Voodoo2 card for AGP slots, 
but I imagine that very few people own them.

As long as you have an AGP slot, any card currently on the market will 
work with your system. Your system is an AGP capable system, but from 
searching the internet, I've found that your system may have an ATI Rage 
card in it. Many systems that use older ATI Rage cards have them on the 
motherboard, leaving you without an AGP slot.  
 
Open the case and look at the motherboard. The top slot (closest to the 
CPU) is the AGP slot. It should like somewhat like a PCI slot, but a bit 
different, both in positioning and color. If you have a card in this slot, 
you're in business. If the slot is empty and doesn't have plastic casing 
around the pins, you have problems.
