So quite some time ago I noticed something funny...

My bard went and got his DE mask.  His first
clicky item.  Has a 4.5 second cast time, and I
have to turn off songs to activate it which is a pain...
On the other hand, as a member of the only large
bard race, I use it quite often as my own personal
shrink item!

At any rate, at some point I'm standing there activating
it when something pops near me and I move away
to begin fight... as my main is a cleric with tons of
clicky items, I'm quite aware that just like spells,
clicky effects get interrupted if you move.

Only it didn't.  Finished the cast and poof I'm a DE.

I've tried this several more times.  Confirmed, you
can click the mask even if you are running with selos
on the whole time.  Start, stop, run circles, whatever
you like.

Just like my songs.

OK, so the question is, is this true of all clicky items
for a bard?

If so, the odds of my camping that damnable AC
for Jboots just went way down, as TBoots will be
even less of a pain then they usually are... and frankly
my cleric is so used to the mild drawbacks of Tboots
that I doubt they would be too bad even if I did have
to stop to refresh the effect.
