(Doh!  Okay, I'm new to this newgroup thing... seems I accidentally clicked
on reply to sender instead of to newgroup ;-) )

I think that he's in the Necromancer/Shadow Knight faction table in Neriak
(TheDead), but I'm not too sure.  I have a mage that is dubious to them, and
that guy is also dubious to me.  All of the other factions there (merchants,
clerics, rogues, warriors, etc.) are amiable or better, so that's why I
think he's on that faction.
As for 'repairing' it, perhaps you could look on allakhazam.com to see what
quests you can do or what mobs you can kill to raise your faction with him.
While there, you can also probably check in the bestiary (if you haven't
already) to see if it states what faction he's on.
