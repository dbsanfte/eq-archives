Of course they could employ a large enough crew of in house testers
to catch something as strange as that- if they charged us $50 a month
to play that is.  Quite simply (in deference to you) EQ is a very
complex mass of code, and unpredictable side effects *will* happen, and
a small group of testers can *not* black box test all the variants in
a system this complex.
