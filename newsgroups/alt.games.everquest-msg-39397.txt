Was reading an interesting thread on a warrior board about dual weild.
The poster was stating that, by putting the slower of any two weapons in
the off hand, you cut the chances for an off hand hit in half.  His
reasoning was that if you primary has a delay of, say, 19, and your off
hand has a delay of 22, the first time you swing, you have a chance of
both hitting. But the next time you swing, 1.9 seconds later, the off
hand weapon won't have recycled yet, so it won't even have a chance of
hitting! In a way, this certainly makes sense.
  However, when I run them through Copeland's the damage output for the
combination with the faster weapon in the primary hand is *way* higher
than switching hands.
  What's the real deal here? Is this guy's theory wrong, or is this
something that Copeland's just doesn't take into account?
