Well, I just tried, for my second time to play this game.  The learning
curve is so steep.  Its not just a pick-up-and-play game.  I printed all
the faqs and read the manual but this is still very hard to play.  I beat a
rat, but that was on auto fight mode.  Is there anyone in Rochester, N.Y.
that is playing this game?  I am in need to see someone actually play this
game in front of me so I can see how to play.
