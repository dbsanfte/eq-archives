SWG and level grinding, anyone?  A lot of people scream about level grinding
in EQ, and there it is in SWG, big as life.

Another way might be to make it limited permadeath.  A MUD I used to play
had no permadeath to Level 20, then after that each death had a chance, 4%
or something like that, of permanently losing you a point of CON.  If you
lost your last point of CON, then your character was perma-dead.  If you
made it to Level 40, then you became an IMM and no longer had the chance of
perma-death.

I liked the boats.  What I wanted to see was more stability, occasional
adventures on them (pirate attacks, say), and the ability to fish while
travelling.  Boats?  What boats?

I dislike teleportals to everywhere.  Why?  Because I've met people who have
no idea where West Commons is.  Because I've had to direct Level 50+ people
on how to get from WC to Nektulos Forest.  Because I've met people who have
never heard of High Pass Hold.
