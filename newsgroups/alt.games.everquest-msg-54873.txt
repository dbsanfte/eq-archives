I don't know if you saw my suggestion in the other armor thread but my mage had
a great time in the Warrens, there are several spots a pet caster can solo in there
and the loot in this zone is absolutely ungodly for the level of critters in there, lots
of bronze weapons, and the molar quest is decent. There was always less than
10 people when I was hunting in there and many times I was the only one
in the zone.

You can easily get bone chips from the paineel newbie zone and as a necro
you may not be KoS in paineel, and with a level or 2 of hunting you should
be good on faction there to bank and shop.

The problem with necros and hunting is the pain of being KoS in many
places where you can't bank or shop.

The warrens will teach you about pet pathing (watch that pet like a hawk)
and when to run (if the pet dies or is dying, head to the zone and don't
look back).
