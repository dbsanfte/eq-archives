 There is a mob in the Imprector (sp?) room on the second floor. He's an
Iksar Shadowknight but I don't know his name. We were camping there one
day and being the overexcited bunch we killed him as soon as he popped.
We took a BN hit. The next time he popped we didn't attack. Conning him
he was indifferent. Quest mob I guess but no idea on which quest. 

 This was a few months ago so it's not "very recently"
