How was your performance affected in the Luclin zones?  You have almost the
identical machine to mine (except I have 512MB of RAM and a GF2 GTS with
32MB).

I can't seem to bring myself to reduce my settings... I love the new models,
love the detail of the high qualith textures (though setting them to low
makes a difference, it's too blurry), I want my clipping plane maxed, 32-bit
depth fixes ugly z-order issues, and anything less than 1280x1024 just seems
blocky to me.  I even like spell effects :)

I guess I get what I deserve.  Still, performance in Shar Vahl is
*playable*, except for a few spots in town that get *very* jerky.  Shadow
haven is problematic too, but I haven't had trouble in fighting areas yet.
Zoning times haven't been bothering me too much (I have texture cache on).

Anyway, in a recent post Absor seemed to say that Umbra would be something
that will eventually help everyone, and that we wouldn't have the ability to
switch it off anymore.  So I haven't tried UseUmbra=False yet.  Did last
night's patch affect anyone's performance?  I didn't see much of a change.
