True, in a group situation I would agree with that wholeheartedly.  We
were partnering and he already said that he was OOM, so it was really
up to me to judge the damage I was doing compared to the damage that
was being done to me.

So, I'll amend that...if you're partnering with a monk and your a
shaman without mana, listen to the monk when he says its time to give
up :)
