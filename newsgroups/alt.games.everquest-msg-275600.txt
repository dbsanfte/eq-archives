What the hell is going on at SOE?

How hard is it to put the slightest information messages to people who pay
money for a game they cannot register?

I mean, just put a "server is down" in the response object.

Put something up on your website Sony.

This is REALLY a bad first impression for EQ II.

Can't login to my old station account (correct name and password) on the
website.
Can login to my old account in the launchpad, but cannot add a forum name
(which for some completely idiotic and retarded reason prevents you from
playing EQ, as if I could give a **** about the forums.)
