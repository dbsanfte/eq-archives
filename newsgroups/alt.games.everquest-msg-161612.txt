I guess you are either very young or very naive. First in this world it 
is VERY easy to mis-interpret what someone says, especially if it is 
passed from person to person. It was very clear to YOU. And possibly 
clear to the Guide, but was it clear to the GM?

Here is an interesting page. Did either the Guide or GM miss one or more 
of these items? Especially numbers 5, 6, 7?

Oh, and by the way, I was joking in my follow-up. Guess when you loose a 
character in EQ, the sense of humor is also lost. But it is very 
difficult to sense humor via electronic communications. See above site.

Sure hope you get your character back.
