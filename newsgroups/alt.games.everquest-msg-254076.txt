Right! But there is a gigantic advantage to this scenario and that is 
that then the people would have a much better idea how much the 
government is taxing us! And, maybe, for a change, they'd figure out how 
to spend less instead of figuring out how to collect more.

I've always felt that the IRS should not be allowed to basically garnish 
our wages. They should be required to bill us monthly or quarterly for 
our taxes. Again, forcing people to actually take stock of how much of 
their money goes to government (not even considering the inherent taxes 
in other products you use such as gasoline taxes and various disposal 
fees, etc).
