Yeah, but what they are called to do by their deities is the big thing
though.  Shaman and Clerics are indeed called on to protect and heal
their people.  Druids though, druids are called on to protect nature.
A druids job it to lay down the whup-ass on anybody who would attempt
to harm 'nature'.  If a druid can heal, he should be able to heal shit
like trees and animals, not people who tend to be the ones that try to
subjugate nature.

Granted, I can see how from a game mechanics POV that this might be
difficult, but healing isn't something druids should really be good
at.  

Basically what I'm saying is, screw CH.  Give druids manaburn. :-)
