	You'd think that, but it doesn't really work that way in practice.

	The existing DMCA would almost certainly be struck down in court, but it
was written in such a way as to avoid "face challenges" (IE, someone like the
EFF or ACLU simply challenging the law's validity in court), and what
enforcement of it has taken place so far has been done in such a way as to
keep the law out of the courtrooms.  This isn't all that hard, as lawyers
excel at convincing people they have fewer rights than they actually have.
