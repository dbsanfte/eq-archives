While I'd have killed for this six months ago, its pretty much non interesting
to me now, with the Surefall Glades port in place for fast access to
Halas area, and Nexus providing relatively fast access to the four continents
plus the moon.  Firepots don't give access to the moon or to Velious,
places I spend easily half my time.

Perhaps I should rethink this, while Nexus has meant its no longer worth
swimming TD from Oasis ( something I did a great deal in my youth) it
might be worthwhile to -bind- there, as I'd still be very close to a Nexus
port (Felwithe to GFay probably closest) and I wouldn't have that
irritating wait till port for other locations.  Being no longer KOS in Cabalis
means decent Kunark accessability.  Hmm.
