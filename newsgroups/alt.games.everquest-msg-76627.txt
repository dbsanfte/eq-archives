the epic despite having serious doubts of ever completing the quest.  I
was able to complete the Lord B portion of the quest in probably less
than half an hour without knowlege that it isn't always so easy.  Cut to
a late night a month or two ago as I was going through my inventory with
half open eyes trying to find space to store a few heavy items I'd been
lugging around....

was used for.  Oh well, at least I'd only done the first few parts of
the quest, not like it was the final pearl or something <g>.   I'd love
