	A defensive system with only a 25% chance of stopping a warhead targetting

strike.  We can do far better than that with existing tech.

	They would have to apply that technology to their entire missile arsenal.
A dozen missiles wouldn't cut it.  We'd still have to counter it, of course,
but there's no advantage to the aggressor here.

	They already bankrupted themselves once trying to cope with the notion.

	That IS a science fiction defense scheme.  The genie is out of the bottle.
It's not going back in.
