This weekend my daughter and I were tootling around as a level 10 druid,
and decided to look around Kithicor a bit (during the day, of course).
At one point we spotted A Cliff Spider, which conned blue, so we lobbed
a Flame Lick at it and began beating on it.  We quickly brought it down
to less than 50% hits, but then its bar filled up to 100% again.  We did
some more damage, and the same thing kept happening!

Choosing the better part of valor, we ran for the zone line, and once it
was in sight we risked an Ignore that managed to kill it in one shot.
We made a note to look it up later to see what folks had to say about
this nasty beastie.  But nothing I can find says anything about it having
such an outrageous regen.

Anyone out there have any experience with this critter, or know what it's
good for?
