Actually, many of his points are not bad, but they are poorly supported.  I
wonder if he knows the reasons behind the arguments.  He also overstates the
fact.  True, taxes are a burden on the economy, and the state has managed to
tax the nation into high unemployment at times (stagflation), but there are
many things that _must_ be done by the government.  Police, firefighting,
and national defence being foremost among them.

OTOH, the government spends more to redistribute income than it does on
defence.  One of these is a constitutionaly mandated duty, the other isn't.
Taxation is also seen as a way to control things that the government doesn't
like, without making them illegal (ie, smoking).  I think by this time, the
gov has way overstepped it's bounds.

I don't want my government to take care of me, to watch over me, or anything
like that.  I do pay my taxes, but I don't like to do so, mainly because I
don't like what my government does with much of it.  So, I go and vote for
the candidates I think will do the least damage.  Occasionally, I get a
chance do actually vote for a candidate I support.
