I'm on verizon DSL in Maryland.  Only had one problem and I called tech 
support and had it fixed within an hour.
If you have any specific questions you can ask Scott and the guys in 
0.verizon.dsl if you are already a verizon customer. Could have asked a 
few weeks ago if you weren't but they had too many idiots from off 
usenet so they locked in the newsserver to verizon customers only.
If you want me to post for ya, I'll forward it on if you want me to.
