If its fantasy...anything can be real...right? How can you "stretch" the
realm of fantasy.
Didju Evah is a perfectly reasonable name for a  character, especially for a
bard.
Bards are the jesters as well as the ballad-singers. Bards are the fun side
of fantasy.
I find this rich coming from a member of a race of cat-people, who calls
himself "Dark Tyger". I mean, tigers are to the Vah-Shir what monkeys are to
humans. I wouldnt call a Barbarian (which are human after all) warrior "Huge
Monkey" or "Violent Orang'Utan"...and you wouldnt let me anyway.
