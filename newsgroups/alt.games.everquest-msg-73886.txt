I think the keyword here is "expect".  In the situation that I spoke
of regarding dying in OT and being bound in RV, there could have been
15 Clerics capable of Reviving me in OT with 10 of them standing
around my body saying "Hmm, wonder how he died." and I would not
EXPECT them to lift a finger to help me.  I dont see anything wrong
with asking if they can though.

Agreed, and part of my thought process when I make that decision might
be "if I die I can see if I can get a revive first", if not, I
walk/swim/captain a floating junk heap=)

>but a lot of people playing aren't like that.

Well understood=)
