Yeah, I can believe that the T&C page has all the right loopholes
to let them "change the terms" of the original offer, but it's still
bad customer relations to make the offer claim that the rate will
continue indefinitely, or at least that the subscription will 
continue even if the rate goes up, and then instead have the subs
completely lapse.

On both of my accounts, I discovered the problem because I happened
to logout (to reboot) and was not allowed to log back in because my
account was "closed".  As was described, I had to shrug and renew at
one of the current rates in order to log back in.  Which I did, and
it didn't take long, and the rate's not that much different, so I
don't really care that much.  But it's still bad customer relations,
not that that surprises anyone here. :-\


Heck, in some sense I got a few days of free play because I didn't get
booted off the moment my year expired.  Frankly, the thing that ticks
me off more, is that they didn't renew the "bonus year" on the veteran
rewards.  Previously, by taking the special anniversary sub rate, my
accounts also got credited for the year immediately for the purposes
of veteran rewards.  I was hoping that, when the sub renewed, they'd
throw that in again, so I could get (a) another vet reward on each
character who has them, and (b) vet rewards on the latest alt that
I've been levelling up.
