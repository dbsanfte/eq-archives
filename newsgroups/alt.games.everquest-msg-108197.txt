  Yes, "Pet Discipline".  It makes it so your pet won't do anything until
you command it to do so.  Enchanters don't get this ability, however,
because they can't issue ANY commands to their pets.  It's a nice ability
for the other pet classes (I think all of the other pet classes do have
access to it), but it's a class ability that I don't think can be learned
until level 59.
