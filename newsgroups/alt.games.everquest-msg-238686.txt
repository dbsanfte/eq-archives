WELCOME to everquest.  Scott already answered all of your questions...but I
have one thing to add.  I wouldn't recommned buying anything armor like from
NPC's in freeport.  I prefer the bazaar, wider selection, and you can
usually get FAR better gear alot cheaper.

Some good sites you will get some use of:
http://eq.crgaming.com/menu/paladin.asp
http://www.allakhazam.com/
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/


Some more abbreviations you might see:
SoW= Spirit of wolf.(run with godlike speed, very handy when you have a long
journey.)
LFA= Looking for adventure, this is the Lost dungeons of Norrath expansion
adventure. (lvl 20+)
Temp= Temperance a cleric's Hp/AC buff, very very nice for you, however
typically you will have to donate 11-15pp for this.
