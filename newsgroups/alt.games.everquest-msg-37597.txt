Troll or not (I'm guessing "not,") he's 100% correct.  Verant doesn't give a
shit about customer service.  The only employees paid anything are the
programmers (probably like 4 of them, 3 of them working FT on SoL, and the
4th working half-days on SoL and the rest on the original game and first 2
expansions.).   In-game CS is "ok," but telephone support sucks.  Pure &
simple.  If they still say "sorry, too many calls, buh bye, call back later
when your psychic friends tell you when our one CS agent is free."
