Welcome to the world of the fighter. They don't call 'em meat shields for
nothing. That being said, I thought this was the case with my warrior in
EQ1. If you haven't played EQ1 you won't be able to see the difference. I
now have a 13 guardian and think I'll keep him over my normal rogue route.
If you don't like what you're doing by all means start a different
character, but remember the character is what you make of it. My warrior
never just "stands around". I judiciously use specials and Ho's, I make
sure the mobs are on me and make sure the pull is handled as well as
possible so no one dies. The downside to being the tank is gearing. Just
like EQ1 the gear makes the tank - and if you're behind the curve there you
won't be as effective as you could (or should) be.
