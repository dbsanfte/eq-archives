> 3.Ram: 512mb of 1066 rdram(if i go with xp maybe 1 gig,not sure)

I had to do some searching to figure out what the heck 1066 rdram is
(1066MHz Rambus), then I priced it at pricewatch...$379 stated price for
512.  Ouch.  I just bought 512MB PC800 (rambus) for $200 and that was ouch
enough!

First off I'd go a little more mainstream on your RAM, but that's just my
opinion.

Anyway, if you want to have all Luclin models on, the MINIMUM RAM you're
going to need (and be happy with) is 512...and that's just to load
'em...doesn't leave that much to play with.  Go with at least 768.

EQ runs better on my Win98se computers, but works fine on my Win2k.  I don't
have a copy of XP at home to play with, but I'd probably be inclined to
check it out if I had nothing better to do.  Some people say that Win98
can't properly handle more than 512MB RAM, and others say that's total
bullshit, but I've never seen empirical data either way so I think I'd just
go with XP.
