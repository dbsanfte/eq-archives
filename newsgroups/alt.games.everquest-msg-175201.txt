My guild wasn't in VT at that point, I only had 1 piece of ssra loot (GMU)
One of the monks there had recently (weeks before) joined my guild, from a
vindi killing guild (WAY below ntov level) and his gear reflected this
My shaman is geared worse than an ntov killing guild (he is a bot after all)
The other monk was using a tunare weapon (no ssra gear either)

Anyway thats not the point... the point is, Trial of Execution can be done
by "non-ubers" comfortably, without a rogue, let alone multiple rogues.

Sure if a rogues available, snap him up.. but your post seemed to hint that
monks and rangers would be unable to contribute to a victory (or any other
damage class).. and thats just not true.
