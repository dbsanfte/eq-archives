Check the price on both mithril leggings and silver-plated leggings (I
think that's the name). Both are plate graphic, though they might be too
expensive if you are strapped for cash (500pp range 6 months ago, they
_have_ to have come down since.  As far as leather-look is concerned, I
dont' recall it that well, since I never went for leather myself.   The
other plate-graphic leggings I can think of (brown chitin, engraved royal
velium, crystal chitin) are much more expensive.
