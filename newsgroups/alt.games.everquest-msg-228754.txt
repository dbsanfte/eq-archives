They deserved this so much, i don't know how long i spoke to them about 1st
person perspective implementation into their games. But no... they didn't
want to budge on something that was so definately in demand by the player
base these and those previous years. Some stuck up chief designers descision
really screwed that company up bigtime. Hopefully he is unemployed now. Next
time listen to your customers.
The cool part is that my own protest was to never buy a game from them even
though i really wanted to, luckily i know a bunch of other people who didn't
buy the game for the same reason. And now we can all LAUGH BIG TIME!!!
MUHAHAHAHAHHA! Triumph!!!

Also some of my design went into Fallout2 without them mentioning my name.
Good ridance you bunch of worthless designers!
