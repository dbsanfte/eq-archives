You might find it worthwhile to occasionally post a GPG or PGP signed
message.  There's a simple way your stalker can fix his NNTP-Posting-Host
header (simple enough that even a moron like him might stumble on to it
eventually) so that it can become much harder to tell you two apart, but he
can never post anything signed with your key.

No need to sign every post of yours.  Just do one occasionally.  Then, if
your stalker ever posts something that is hard to tell from the original,
or adopts the annoying stalker trick of claiming you are the imposter and he
is the original, you can post a signed post explaining things.
