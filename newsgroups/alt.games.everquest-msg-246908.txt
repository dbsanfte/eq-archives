My suggestions:
1. Find a way for the development team to play the game they code.  They
should be playing the various classes and going to raids, doing xp groups,
etc. to really understand the perspectives and frustrations of the players.
2. Implement a strong review system and have code peer reviewed. I'm not
behind the scenes at SOE, but my strong feeling is that this isn't the way
it's done now.  I think features/encounters are coded by John Doe, then
there's a little testing of whether it seems to be working, then, kabong,
it's live.
3. Do not release expansions with unfinished content.  I think announcing a
new expansion with all the discontent about GoD still strong was a mistake.
This next expansion could be critical.  It will certainly sell well, but if
people find it as disappointing as GoD I think SOE could really be in
trouble with future expansions.  They really need to have more than a week
or two of beta-testing, but my gut tells me that they'll rush this out when
an extra month of testing and development would have been better.

That said, EQ has so many players and is such a strong habit for most
players I don't know that anything SOE does wrong (within reason) is going
to really hurt the game in the short term.  There's a lot of competition on
the horizon and sometimes dynasties crash and burn overnight, but my money
is on EQ continuing to dominate the next couple of years.
