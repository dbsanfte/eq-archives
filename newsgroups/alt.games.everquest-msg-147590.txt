    I read a few of the responses to this post, so I included that as a
preamble to asuage any of the questions about my patriotism before I replied
to this post.
    I agree that VI should maybe have dropped something in somewhere in
rememberance, especially since there was an exec who worked at VI and lost a
son when the Trade Center attacks took place... but they didn't. It lessens
my opinion of the people responsible for such things and who work at VI and
Sony, but never will I forget to stop and pay my respects to the people who
were lost that day and their families who lost them.
    I still salute the US Flag when in it's presence. I still boil with
anger at the cowardice shown on 9/11 by terrorists who pretend to live and
die honorably. I still fear God and try to follow his word... and I still
play EQ. It may be their world... they may be the ones who make the rules...
but EQ is full of people who are honorable, compassionate patriots with
heavy hearts and unbeatable strength, regardless of the corporate engine and
attitude that has created a place for them to go.
    That said, there's never anything stopping Guild Leaders from putting up
a memorable Guild MOTD... or keeping each of us from saying just about
anything memorable in a few well timed /ooc's... or keeping any from sending
a tell to another, friend or not, just to remember. VI's world, our place...
    Something I use to hear alot comes to mind: There is a gap between where
we are now and where we will be soon... a gap, really, for each direction we
choose to take from here. Some choices lead the right direction, some lead
the wrong. The question is: Do you have the fortitude to stop and stand in
the gap going the wrong way so that others will go the right way?
    That said, quit griping about the corporation behind the game, and
concentrate on what you could do in your own piece of their world in
rememberance of things in ours. Trying to show them their own ignorance is
one thing... not taking the time to show the rememberance you're saying they
forgot is quite another. Did you even once "/ooc Thank you! Thanks to all of
you who stand in the gap for us. Thanks to all of you who wake up every day
protecting America. Thanks to all of you who walk our streets enforcing the
law. Thanks to all of you who live to save lives and souls. Thank you, all
of you."? I know I did, even while wondering why VI didn't.
