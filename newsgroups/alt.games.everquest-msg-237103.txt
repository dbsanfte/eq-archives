Getting back to the origional question, Chanter soloing is fantastic
exp with charm, especailly at the top end.  There are dozens of guides
as to how & where to do it on the chanter boards at
http://www.therunes.net/forums so I wont try & suggest a place.  The
best ones now for your level probably didnt exist when I was at it!

With regards to the exp issues, there are 2 main schools of thought on
this:

1 Do some damage, get most of the exp.  This is generally my preferred
route.  If you do 1 dmg you get 67% of the exp but you can kill more
mobs in a given time therefore on the whole your exp per hour rate is
higher.  Get your self a Blue Ceramic Band & use it to pull.  It does
5dd + 1dot per tick, the agro off it is much less than your pet
generates so its easy to get the mob off you.  Root the target mob
then tash & slow, sit back & let your pet kill.  ALWAYS keep the
target rooted & sit as far away from the fight as poss so that when
charm breaks you can get out of the way.

2 Do most of the damage, get all of the exp.  This involves a bit of
mob juggling, it's very effective once you get practiced at it but can
be hairy at times.  Don't try & do 51% of the damage as someone
suggested - you havn't a hope.  In HoH my pet is doubling for 550 -
600 depending on the pet, my best nuke atm is 1320 - I'd have to chain
it to stand even a chance of out damaging & then Id have to med back
up for the next.

The method to get all the exp is:
Pull target with BCB as before, send in your pet, root & tash the
target.  DO NOT SLOW IT.  Use nukes to keep the target mob just below
the health of your pet.  Once they are getting low on health back off
your pet (mez the target if necessary), set him to guard, target him,
get yourself well out of the way & break charm.  My preferred means is
to use Improved Invis as you can be well out of range when you break &
start spamming the root key.  Nuke yout ex pet to death - you get 100%
exp from him even thought the mob did most of the damage.  Go back to
your origional target & finish him off with nukes.  Because your pet
is already dead its damage is wiped from the target & you get 100%
exp.

What I tend to do is a combination of the 2 methods, using a pet for a
long as poss then killing it to gain its exp & starting again. 
Generally get 3 kills per pet.  In HoH, soloing the SE basement or
Hero Shrine I'm getting 3% AA per kill on the first basis & 5% on the
second.  I can generally keep this up without a med break for quite a
time but I get bored.  I can probably get 1 AA per hour or less.

The same methods work well in Plane of Fire.  Scaling it down to a
lower level, provided you have a ready supply of mobs & an area to run
around in (and a goodly supply of Jaspers for Rune3) you should be
able to use the same methods sucessfully.

Good Hunting!
