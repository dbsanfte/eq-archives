So you figure all those arab-american muslim ladies in their iconic 
drape and veil stuff feel really really comfortable walking into a 
typical christian church?

How about a broom closet wiccan, walking into buildings representing 
people that literally burned people at the stake on the accusation that 
they were witches?

How about a Jehovah's Witness walking into a Seventh Day Adventist 
church (them's fightin words, I hear)

How about just me, Joe Citizen, objecting on philisophical 
constitutional grounds, without any implicit fear or anger about the 
religion itself... I don't care which religion it is, I find them all 
equally objectionable in this particular.
