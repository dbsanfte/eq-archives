> Woot! I made half a k at work. God bless the bazaar.

Aye - it is addictive though. I ended up going on a buying selling binge to
equip an baby Druid (hey - I have never played one before) and I ended up
with an obscenly twinked scantilly cladd which has 700+hp and 540ac self
buffed at level 15.

I used to have a *Ranger* at level 30 that would have envied those figures.
Every now and again I bite the bullet and actually play the game again and
not just keep the vendor running whilst accidently walking head long into
the begginings of a real life again.

Since the Bazaar has been introduced I have found a sweet 24yo (I am 30) GF
from HK who is studying here in Brissy, lost some weight, dropped my
medication dosage and even seen the sun on occasions.

Damn you Verant - if I get skin cancer I will sue your asses off...

*grins*
