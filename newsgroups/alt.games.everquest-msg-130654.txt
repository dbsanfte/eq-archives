I've accepted that long ago.  Again, you'll notice, I'm not even suggesting
pansy shit like lawsuits and stuff.  All I'm doing is asking Cox to take
care of something that's f'sked up.

I'm well aware of my shortcomings, thank you.  Now, did that trite little
bit have a point?  Do you mean to say we're not all perfect?  Ooooh, gasp,
what a concept.

I'm not pretending it doesn't exist, I'm saying "get this shit out of here."
I know it's still out there, and I don't care, as long as it's not here.

So, you say I'm wrong for trying to get that group off the server I use, and
in the same breath say that I should do something.  What would you have me
do?  Car bomb the creator of the group?  Petition the government?  You are a
thoroughly confused person.

I am doing the only thing I have a right to do.  Anything above this would
be either illegal, or of Jessie Jackson quality.  They have a right to free
speech, but they don't have a right to say it everywhere they want.  If Cox
decides that the group violates their standards, then Cox has every right to
tell them to get lost.
