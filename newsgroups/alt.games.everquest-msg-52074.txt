I mean even lower levels than mine... porcupining starts to get a
bit shakey for killing reds towards the top end of the teens... even
with the upgrade in DS damage at 19, like you say, the mobs
get to hitting to hard to let them kill themselves on you.

I can kill stuff fairly efficiently with half Nuke, half DS, but I think
that's part of a trend, by the end of the 20's I'll bet self DS will
be pretty much relegated to trying to keep defense skill maxed out.

If I didn't want to solo, I'd be playing my cleric.  Srimp is there
to let me solo, and embrace the downtime as a way of getting the
dishes done!
