It is much better than the ATI Rage Pro.  Not sure how much better in that 
system.  I got acceptable performance using a GeForce 2 MX-400 with 64MB of 
memory in a P3-800 system with 786MB of memory, with all options on, 
including Luclin models, just as a point of reference.  I would get the 
cheapest video card I could find in that performance range, the Ge3 Ti500, 
Ge2 MX400, ATI has some older ones that are comparable in performance I 
believe as well.  The hard part is that you may not have any AGP slots in 
that system, so will have to find a PCI video card.
