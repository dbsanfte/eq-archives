It's definitely 15 in NK at least. I showed up just as the two minute
countdown was going on. Everyone beamed up. I grabbed a stone from the
nexus chick and wandered out into the field to screw with my settings
some more to try to improve the frame rate. I had made note of the time
when they announced "15 Minutes to the next teleportation!" or whatever
the wording is. Sure enough, slightly less than 15 minutes later the
short countdown started again.

Not sure if it's the same in all zones, of course.
