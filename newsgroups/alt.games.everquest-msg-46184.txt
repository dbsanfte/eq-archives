There are a number of tricks I use:

I try to get the puller to announce which mobs they want to attack on the way
back froma pull. If the mobs are different type this is usually the easiest
and i will have the first one of many mezzed before or as the crowd arrives.

I watch the fight spam to see who my party is wacking on, not great usually
there is too much fight spam, but every bit of information helps.

Often I will just select a mob and wait a few seconds to see if its health
starts to drop, and mezz it if it stays healthy.

Three or four of the same type can be dicy, particularly if the mobs are
right on top of each other. After mezzing sometimes I will call for my party
to back up a bit to seperate the mezzed for the active.

In some situations, I hold back and let the cleric get off the first heal and
mezz the ones that jump the cleric.
