No. Not really. I seem to have been smoking crack. You are absolutely 
right. I must have been thinking of something else.

Nope its just Wenla. =/

Majus Wenla does in fact port without the adventure stone. Not just to 
abysmal sea & natimbi, but to any of the ldon camps. The other ldom magi 
however still require the adventure stone.

That's as much as I could test, however, there are rumours its also 
possible to complete the adventure stone quest even if you don't own 
ldon (of course *I* can't test that), obtain your stone, and use all the 
ldon magi. It does seem likely to me though.

At any rate you can definately port to abysmal at level 1, without the 
stone, provided you can get to nedaria's landing. The hardest part is 
getting through BB or SFG, which pretty much requires invis at low 
levels if you are evil, but that's not out of line for an expansion that 
is geared at the 50+ crowd.  Its no harder than getting to, say, velious 
as a level 1 erudite necromancer, at any rate, without using luclin/pop 
transport systems.

Regards, and sorry for the confusion. =)
