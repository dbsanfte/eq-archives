Once upon a time when faction meant something it was more like this.

You'd see trolls and ogres, but only out afield... or perhaps in the 
sewers of qeynos...

It was actually pretty cool, in a way, at least.

Trolls were seriously screwed pretty much from day one, the large races 
have always been unpopular because they get stuck on stuff. The 
barbarians were smarter and better looking, and the Ogres had better 
melee stats, the troll regen benefit was rapidly obsoleted by gear in 
the expansions...(possibly until yesterday... how does troll and iksar 
regen compare now??) when an extra 2 points of regen on top of all the 
other regen just wasn't significant, and the ogre stun benefit was much 
more useful overall.

The luclin graphics update really did a number on them IMO.

Nowadays trolls are *the* forgotten race...not even deserving of a home 
zone... ever since Ykesha drove them out of the swamps and into 2nd 
class citizens in Neriak.

I'd like to roll up a troll... but they're class picks are pretty 
slim... i already have a shm-frog, sk-eru, bl-vahshir...

I guess I could roll a troll berserker... but I've been sort of been 
thinking of going dwarf on that.

That leaves war, which I'm just not interested in as a class atm.

/sigh
