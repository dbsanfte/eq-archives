Give it up. You are dealing with a brick wall, and it's the same one
(likely the *only* one) you run into any time somebody tries to "defend"
the existance of a god or gods in an argument where facts or science is
being cited. You can not *ever* prove a negative 100%. I don't mean
about god discussions only, here. You can't prove *any* negative. That's
what religious defenders fall back on in such arguments. 

"Prove there isn't a god."

As Bizbee pointed out, "Prove there isn't a five headed giant squid
under the North Pole."

Same thing.

Blah. Lack of debate material.

If you choose to believe in any given god(s) that's just fine, and good
for you. But at least acknowledge that the basis of such belief is
entirely faith. Faith isn't something you question, because the
questions can't be answered or proven.
