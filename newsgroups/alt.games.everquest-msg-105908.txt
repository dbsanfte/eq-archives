My first character was a melee class. I soon realized that as an un-twink I
was way underpowered, and suspected that the game may have already been
"balanced" to provide a challenge for twinks and impossible pretty much for
non twinks. I quickly retired that character, started a caster and have
never looked back. Since then ive twinked the melee, got it to level 52
fairly painlessly and had a good time. Its really sad to see the legit
players wandering around LFG for ages because they arnt twinkes and people
thus dont want them.

I wouldnt mind a system like in d2 where items have a level restriction, of
course this would severely upset a lot of people (and rightly so too, I
object to items "changing"). I dont like nodrop... it just serves to remindd
me that its a computer game and not the real world. (as does zoning effects)
