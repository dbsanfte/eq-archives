}Some of them are only acquaintances, but I know 5-6 people who are HIV+.

True, but is it safe to assume that you know more than 30 people?

}But for the average person, I doubt they know that many people.

Likely true.  Of course, you may know HIV+ people who aren't 'out' about 
it.

}(although I saw something on the CDC website that estimates that only
}roughly 50% of those who are HIV+ know they are positive).

That same CDC page says there's roughly 800,000-900,000 people living with 
HIV in the US.  Even if you double that, that's less than 1% of the US 
population...  Which is again, much less than 1 in 5 people I know.  Let's 
hope it stays there. :)
