Whatever it is I did, it goes way beyond EQ settings.  To clarify my
situation: when I have my desktop resolution set the way I like it,
1024x768, and I start any program which uses a different resolution, I
wind up with box centered in the screen of the resolution the program
uses, surrounded by a black border out to the edge of the screen.  For
example, I play EQ at 800x600.  Normally, when I go to the spellbook,
I get the 640x480 book screen with the black border that is normal
when that "same size" thing is set whichever way I have it.  Now,
however, it appears that the screen resolution isn't changing at all,
but rather displaying reduced versions that fit on the initial
setting.  Fullscreen, windowed mode, it makes little difference.  This
happens with more than just EQ.

I'm not sure any of that made sense.  I have discovered that if I set
the desktop resolution to 800x600, most things seem to work.  But, I
miss the extra acreage.

I'm probably just gonna take it into the shop.  I've done enough
damage already.  And maybe I'll get another hard drive while I'm
there.  So it works out.
