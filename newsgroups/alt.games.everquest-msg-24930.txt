Hello all,

Last night a friend and I finished up our language lessons that we have been
working on for a while.  As far as we know, we have mastered every language
in the game except Elder Wurm and Dragon.

Assuming we can't find someone to train one of us at least 1 point in these,
how do we go about getting our first point?  They don't show up as trainable
at our trainers.

I'm a 23rd level Chanter and he is a 27th level Ranger.  We're on the Karana
server.
