I might also suggest verifying that your 3D settings in the ATI control 
panel are set to "let application decide" under anti-aliasing and 
anisotropic filtering. I don't know what this might have to do with

that little bit mentioned in the past relative to other issues. Worth a 
shot if you're out of ideas.
