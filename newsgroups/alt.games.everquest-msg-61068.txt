Try and find a Wyrd Angle

We have a range from 5-35 I think with the majority posting around about
20-30, but having alts down your level. We are a social guild and fully
expect a number of our heavy bods to end up leaving for uber guilds as
they want. We really are there people to talk to in down time, info
sharing, trickle down of kit or access to trade skills as you develpo
yours. The guild vcame over from Torvonnilous in the movelog and expanded
rapidly....we want to try and get a few guild events going and
raids....ideally raids where the low levellers hit to top of a dungeon and
the mids and high go deeper in. It means there is hardware around for
rescues and the whole guild gets to play at once.
