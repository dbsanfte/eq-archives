There's nothing stopping the mob from getting to you up on the wall.  In my
experience, it is only the oldest zones where the mobs completely ignore
walls and walk over/through them.  That suggest a fundamental issue that
would probably involve re-downloading the zone to fix.  For the amount of
use that those zones get these days, it's simply business that dictates it's
not worth doing anything about.
