Egads. I remember that bug. We sent in screen shots of a corpse with the 
person who owned it OFF LINE, taken consecutively, showing the corpse 
timer still running. To the best of my knowledge, the GM's never did 
admit there was a bug, nor help out anyone who got fucked by it. But 
yeah, mysteriously it got fixed the following month. I ate at least two 
no-rez deaths from that one resulting from late night play on a work night.
