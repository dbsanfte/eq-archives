Change your password!  I was recently banned from EQ because someone else
hacked into my account and used a program to cheat at the game.  A friend of
mine in real life had that message come up, and he knew that he had NOT made
an inaccurate entry the evening before when he logged on to play.  I am
still trying to get the ban lifted, but it has been a real headache.  As I
said in an earlier post it's like getting a speeding ticket if a car thief
was caught speeding after having stolen my car.  That's the best analogy I
can think of.
