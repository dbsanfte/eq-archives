OK, you're right, blanket statements are counter-productive.  Would you
agree that the majority of soloers spend their time fighting low blues?
I'm not disputing your claim, but I rarely see soloers pulling in areas
with many wandering mobs (druids quad-kiting in Overthere doesn't count
since they always kite off the beaten path).

There was a WHOLE lotta bitching about 'not getting a bonus for solo play'
both here and on whineplay.  I must have seen 20 different posts bitching
about how Verant has ruined the game by making it more difficult to solo,
though you did not make this bitch, so I apologize for insinuating that
you did.  As to dying in groups, Lower Guk is Lower Guk, and not being
able to gate just sucks when the Magus and the Frenzy room are trained on
you.  A quick rez and you're back in business (unless another train hits
right as you get rezzed, which is when I go solo for a couple hours).

Grouping for loot is repetative in that you kill the same stuff over and
over, but at least it keeps you busy, gets you lots of exp, and may get
you some good loot.  It's one thing to be dropping an even conning mob
every 45 seconds and something else entirely to camp the corrupt guards in
WK and kill one high blue and one low blue every 15 minutes.   I don't
think I claimed to be the best player, I do happen to play a character
that dies a lot (bards seem to die the most of any class, lots of aggro,
not many HPs, no gate), and I do a LOT of dungeon crawling.  By
35 I had been through all the old world dungeons (other than Kedge) and
at 44 am working my way through Velious dungeons.  I'm not talking about
camping a dungeon as much as fighting my way from one end to the other.
(I still prefer to fight my way to anything I'm camping, dead mobs hit
for a lot less than mobs that just saw through invis.)

With the time you have to play, soloing definately makes more sense.  I
can also see why you play a mage rather than a necro (must faster spin up
time).  And my dying generally doesn't mean that my group dies (unless the
entire party is trained).  Some classes are very effective at providing
enough time for everyone else to get away.

My comments were not directed at you, but rather at the person who said
"There are more risk to playing solo, so the benefit should be greater. I
think this is wrong"  Which is at best a questionable statement.  Not only
is there less risk in soloing (my personal opinion, but it also seems to
be the concensus), the game is designed with grouping in mind, and I
think it's perfectly acceptable for Verant to tune the game as such.  
I don't want to get into a flame war with you; I'll save that for the
level 10 monks who extoll the virtues of soloing.  I hope you enjoy your
adventures, and find places that you can group for short play sessions.  (I
recommend  Dreadlands for 37-45, good exp no loot, but easy to get in and
out.)
