Oh OUCH!  That sounds very similiar to my worst MMORPG nightmare.  I was
fortunate...not only do I have a cautious nature, but I had a chance in
beta to try the Nektulos run out.  By the time I got to the live game I
had a good idea of how to go about getting safely to the docs in Nek.
Sadly there is no "easy" way to do it...no simple zone-wall to use the
entire way.  If you aren't good at the "warrior sneak" (ie, just waiting
for openings to dash through), then sometimes I think the best tactic is
to get close enough to that area so that when you die and respawn, you
respawn at the place near the docs. :P
