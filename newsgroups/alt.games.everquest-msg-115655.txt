One of our main 60 guild rangers has been trying for some time to complete
this quest - I don't know a single other person on the server who even has
one, so at least on prexus its not common in the slightest.

Also it got nerfed (have to now equip to use) how many of you guys wear that
cloak (shitty stats) on raids?

Isn't it double normal damage for mobs that are stood still, but *not*
rooted ?

Rangers get criticals with Archery over and above any Combat

Anything that increases raw dps is never a bad thing.

Maybe it was just luck, or maybe it was my ambidex making the difference,
but I got solo exp against various guild assasins in kael a few weeks back
(both were backstabbing it)

> No question in my mind who would get most kills.

I've never once been ks'd by a ranger.. I don't know the class well, so I
don't know how well their particular gear rates, but they are all primal
equipped, wearing GoDs, and that ranger/druid/warrior cloak from ntov with
the right click DS (items like these are nice on any class)

Also, if the mob even has 1 toe in the wall, you can't hit it with archery.
I can think of several fights where we pin the mob against a wall/in the
corner  (Dain, Sontalak, not sure if Yeli counts), including various nToV
fights (where the mob isnt rooted obviously) such as aary.
