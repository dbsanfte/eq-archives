That happened to me a couple of times. I'd be leaving a zone, and when
I'd activate the gate to another area, i'd get dumped back to
character selection and I wouldn't be able to log back on, getting a
error about already having a character in the world. However, if you
wait about 2 minutes, you can usually log back on then.
