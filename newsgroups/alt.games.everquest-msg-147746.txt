I would also include Ghoulbane, which though it is ultimately part of the
pally epic quest, it is very worthwhile doing for its own merit.
Paw of Opolla is worthwhile too, even though it can take a while.
The Garou Club one from Iceclad is pretty good.
Shield of Bane Warding in Katta Castellum...I think its fixed now.
