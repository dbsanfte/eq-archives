Throw away? Just because she had 100 base wisdom? I played my first
character to level 39. I had one alt at the time, which I played to
level 10 (my wood elf warrior, who worshipped Karana at the time)
When I restarted, I got my druid back first. Took statpoints from sta
and dex and gave her 110 base wisdom, and she is now 40. I have three
alts (levels 5, 6, and 7) who I don't expect to take places until I
get more playing time or my druid becomes a wanderer. One of the alts
is my restarted warrior, who no longer devotes her work to a deity as
a form of worship.

My warrior will feel miffed about that since she doesn't want to get
on bad terms with her creator; she'll probably go to hell instead.
My shadow knight, on the other hand... (I find it appropriate for them
to one day hunt the realm of the other's deity)
