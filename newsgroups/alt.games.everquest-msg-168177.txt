Are there laws enforcing how airlines conduct their business? In the
case of airlines, there's no risk of the airline deciding not to take
you or taking you somewhere you don't want to go (as long as you don't
get on the wrong plane. ><), so there's no risk to the customer in
paying up front. They're monitored very closely.

Do you pay for your dinner at Red Lobster up front? Do you pay your
cab fare up front? How many gas stations still let you pay after you
pumped the gas? (Just about all of them around here...) Phone and
utility bills are charged after the services have been used.
Mechanics, credit cards, etc.
