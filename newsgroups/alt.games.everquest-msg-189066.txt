That's a good mask, certainly a thousand times better than what you
have.

You could get the mask I just got today - Eyepatch of Plunder (yay
me!). That's quested, so technically you get it for free. Will be
better than the death mask in any situation where you aren't with a
shaman or enchanter, and very close to it at all other times. Of
course the quest is a PITA....
