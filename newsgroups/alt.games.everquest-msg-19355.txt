Many good 2hs are now 200pp and under and don't forget the Newbies
favourite, the Axe of the Iron Back, 16/37, when it was released to the
general populace it made a mockery of many a 2hs weapon, the Shiny Brass
Halberd, the Blackened Iron Bastard Sword, the Silvery TwoHanded Axe even
the reverred Langseax of the Wolves had lower dam/del ratio. Under level 20
(and affordable by non twinks) nothing came close. Nowadays you can pick
most of the above up for under 100pp (the Iron Back Axe for around 50pp)

If you have around 200pp to spend under level 20, try and get a Tower Guards
blade 16/36 +5ac they go for under 200pp in fact more likely under 150
nowadays.
