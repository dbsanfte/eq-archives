Has anyone some experience with setting up regular groups on
Morell-Thule Server? I am sick of the pick-up groups, and most of the
people in my guild are too high level for this char.

What do you all do? How do you keep the group working even if not all
the members show everyday?

BTW, this email at the top works for me unchanged, if you are on MT
and have a Low 20s level char.
