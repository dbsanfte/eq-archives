If you die in an area where your corpse is unrecoverable (i.e., a wall. 
This used to be a much bigger problem.) A GM will usually summon your 
corpse to somewhere more accessible. If it happens again, /petition the 
GM and tell them your corpse is lost. If it is in such an area they will 
summon it for you. If not, try and find a necro, shadowknight, or bard 
to locate it for you.
