I think that you are probably pretty close to correct there. :)
Actually, I suspect that the huge quantity of printed material
(including painted signs) specifying hours for various activities is
what holds most organizations back from varying their hours with the
season.  Consider just briefly how many periodic human activities
conform to printed schedules, combine that with the general resistance
to change common to most any group of people and the expense entailed
in changing printed/painted schedules, and then consider it on a
scale of hundreds of millions of people.  Do you still wonder why it is
necessary in a practical sense for the "powers that be" to dictate a
changing of the clocks in order to get our largely urban and heavily
scheduled population to take best advantage of the available daylight
(leaving aside the validity of their definition of "best advantage").
