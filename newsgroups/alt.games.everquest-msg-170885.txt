I've been 2 boxing a cleric and enchanter for a short while, it's a bit
difficult (charm duoing), and I wouldn't every try it in a group.  I
can't imagine trying to duo anything with a bard, it'd be darn near
impossible.  I'm so worn out after playing my bard for a few hours I
feel like I need a nap and a vacation, and I don't nap.  I can solo my
bard just fine, he's on FV, so not twinked, up to lv 19 so far.

I don't have anything against PLing an alt, usually people on an alt
know what they are doing, but PLing a main would be bad.
