Also, of the euro severs, the Bayles are normal VI/Sony ones - the others
are run by Ubisoft, level of CS may be different - certainly www.eqloft.com
has hyped the CS on them. Seems a bit strange though that you can choose to
play on any of them at server-select, but only register a PoP key on a Sony
or a Ubisoft - not both (hmm, I'm confused myself now - has anyone better
knowledge?).
