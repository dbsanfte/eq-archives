I agree.

Nah, it was just a frustration, even more so because on your higher
characters you don't have the spellbook. They did it to give players a
bone but make it seem like for some reason the spell book had to be
there before when in reality it should have been sitting the entire
time.


>"Why not just start all characters at level 10..."

Because making 1 - 10 easier and making it so you
pop up with your gear just means low level players
will be out running around and in dungeons more instead of staying 
glued to freeport and the east commons for all that time.

That is verant's intention, not to make the game "easier" per se.


>"With the new rezzes, CR's are a thing of the past..."

Not, it just makes it so if you are level 33 you'd have a level
33 cleric xp res you and it would seem pretty good.


>"U want my experience back from all the hell-levels..."

They have the same XP to get to 51. The only difference is 
there will be a multiplier or something so you don't take
as long to level in 45. Guess what? That also means there has
to be a divider in the levels before or after so its still the same
amount of xp to 51.

Yep. These are great changes, all that remains to make me happy is to
do something about boats.
