A Paladin can single pull FM Giant Fort.  This is the only place in
all of EQ I've ever found that the Lull line of spells is actually
useful.  FM Giants have crap MR and so Soothe very rarely gets agro,
and they like to stand almost far enough apart for a high 20s to mid
30s single pull.  That low MR also makes Root wonderful, Snare a snap,
and Charm pretty good risk/reward (have a Paladin, SK, or Ranger
in your group to get agro fast on those occassions Charm fails and
the risk goes to near zero).  Just remember that many folks get
confused, or even upset, when they don't expect you to be using Charm,
communication is key to good group dynamics.
