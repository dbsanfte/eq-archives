Dang... I heard about this recently, and had a good link on it, but can't 
find it now. :(  The jist of it was that there was some way you could 
include keywords in a particular way, or something, that would boost the 
page's score on google so it would come up earlier on searches.  And the 
net result was that google was less useful as a search engine than it used 
to be.  I don't think it related to them being paid off, I think it was 
somethig about exploiting the rules their search engine used.

Wish I could just find that darn link. :)
