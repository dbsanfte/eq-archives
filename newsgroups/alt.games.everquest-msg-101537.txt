They'll find a way, they always do.  Gotta make us salivate for the next
expansion, we are all such sheep.  I know this but I'm still thinking of
preordering the durn thing...I'm such an addict.  Preordered luclin, bought
the other expansions a month after I bought full version of old EQ, so I've
put some money down on this game and will probably keep playing and buying
for long while.
