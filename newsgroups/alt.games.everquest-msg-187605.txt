    You seem to be asking for a moral judgment, which is a fucking ballsy
move around here lol.

    My opinion: You were obligated to rez him because that's part of your
expected group role, however long before he died you should've either had
him booted from the group, left yourself, or at least taken him to pieces
over his totally unnaceptable behavior. Stand up for yourself, you have the
moral high ground on this one, but almost put yourself on his level refusing
to rez.

    RE the KSer I like what you did BUT if you EVER get a tell or /ooc or
/shout from someone admitting to *Deliberate* KSing, for a joke or for any
reason, /report and /petition them PLEASE. They have no excuse for not
knowing it's against the game rules and should have their account suspended
for a period or banned. I'm not talking about accidental or lag related
KSing or anything like that, but the deliberate fuckwit shit that drives
everyone insane.

    Like rooting a feared, snared mob with 1/4 of his hp missing that I'm
trying to kite then nuking it to death when I back off to avoid needlessly
spending my hp. GRRRRRRRRR <loads anti-druid canon>. I've never got anyon to
admit to it though, when accused they invariably say "his hp bar was full".
Lying pisses me off almost as much as stealing.

    That kind of behavior made me want the "KSee has option to PvP KSer"
automatic rule ;) God only knows what dooming darkness would do to a druid
being chased by two hill giants. (Cancel sow and drop him to 40% of his
*unbuffed* movement rate) Probably against some PvP rule but it's a
wonnerful fantasy ;)
