I use both.

I almost always have an Allakhazam browser window open on the computer next to my gaming
system.  And an EQ Atlas window.  Between the two, I can quickly answer almost any
question that I, or others, may have.  I also use Allakhazam's character tools,
particularly the Equipment Upgrader.

But Magelo is still the default standard for character "reporting", and, besides, it's
just not that expensive.  I keep a consistently up-to-date profile on Magelo for each of
my characters.  I don't use any of Magelo's tools other than Magelo Update.

Best regards,
