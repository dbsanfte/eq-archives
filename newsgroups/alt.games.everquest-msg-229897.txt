Foraging is not the only way to get those fruits (assumingy you can 
forage them at all, I haven't runa  foraging character around 
shadeweaver much), there are trees (with.. blue leaves I think?) under 
which you will find one, two, or three ground spawn spots where you can 
pick up the fruits.  Its possible, without SOW, to run a lap of the half 
the zone on the Shar Val side of the mountain and pick up most of a 
stack of the things and get back to start just as respawns are 
beginning, or you can pick areas to hunt/pharm and just pick the fruits 
from under the trees near you as they pop up, just as a bonus.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage, Firiona Vie... must have made over 100pp off 
the fruit trade as a wee gnome with a Vah Shir shaman buddy
