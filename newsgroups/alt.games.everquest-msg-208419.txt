Okay, I have no idea why, but for the past two weeks, whenever I try to play
Everquest, it somehow gets my cable modem to disconnect.  I'll go through
the patcher thing in the beginning, but when I get to the main menu, where
the buttons for Connect and Options are and everything, my cable modem's
lights go out, and the thing won't reconnect until I back out of the
desktop.  I've tried talking to EQ tech support, but nothing's come of that,
I've tried talking to Comcast.net's tech support, but they weren't much help
either.  It's really annoying and I have no idea why this has started
happening.  If anyone knows of this happening before, or has any possible
solutions, I'd be really greatful.
