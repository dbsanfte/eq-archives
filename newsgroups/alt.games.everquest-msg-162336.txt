Beyond failing for silly reasons, two observations:

If the previous group fails and leaves any mobs up, you need to
give a good long time before you zone in so they despawn.  Get in
there with mobs still up and the game kicks members of your group
out as "more than 6"

If there is a pet  left in there, no problem... unless one of the
mob happens to hit it with an AE, in which case it aggros and
suddenly one of your party is kicked.

Rumor has it the final mob is bugged so that any slow over 50%
actually HASTES him instead of slowing him down.
