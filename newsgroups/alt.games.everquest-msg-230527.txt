Well the holiday season is over, now isn't it?  The season of brotherhood,
goodwill among men -- are now all tossed over into the briney drink.  And
that said.. I'm in complete agreement, with you, friend, Bizybee.

Now that Santa's sleigh has tripped the horizon fantastic, and naughty and
nice are dispatched for another year -- well, why not?  Let bygones be
bygones, for sure.

After all, I was only trolling this group.  And you were only defending
it.  From the rampaging hordes of sprog-spawning, politically-correcting,
non-rocket scientisting, and "Let's not encourage others to scream 'FUCK'
in other people faces" idiots scratching at the door of the temple of
intellect, that -- if we're correct -- you're the chief adept defending
with your life.  Or, your throat.  Or, perhaps some other body part.  A 
pliant one, at least.

Yes, Bizybee, you win.  For another year at least, you're the top dog.  
God among men, and avatar of the newsgroups!  All hail Bizybee!

For another 350 days, at least..  HAIL!  Hail, Bizybee!
