Bjarke,

I run an lower spec AMD box with W2K and have no crash issues to speak of
with LDoN installed.

I used to have alot of problems and this is what I did to fix them.

First, I flashed my bios and installed the latest version from the
manufacturers web site.

Second, I reinstalled the OS.

I updated all drivers including MB & Video.

I refrained from upgrading to DX9.

I repatched the game by going into the advanced settings on the patch
downloader.

I made sure my firewall was configured properly.

Everything seemed to work fine after that.

If I was you, I would try going back a DX release first.

Hope you get it sorted.
