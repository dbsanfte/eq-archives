We almost had a decent earring rot in Ssra, usable by most melee
classes:  AC 5, 5 Str, 5 Sta, 5 Dex, 55 HPs, 45 Mana, Sv Disease and
Magic 10.

It took some prodding but eventually someone took it as an upgrade,
if we had been on points then the cost would have been the same as
attending a *single* AoW raid.  Unless you spent a wad of cash or
camped Cazic extensively items like that will be upgrades for you so
the fact that you don't have huge amounts of points to spend
shouldn't be a problem surely?
