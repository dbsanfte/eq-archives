I level very slowly, and several of the best EQ players I've met also
level slowly, but I think this is the slowest.  My guildleader finally
made 60 yesterday, after 175 days played.  Granted, necros who pull
alot die alot, but I think this this is some kind of record.  Odd
thing is that he really was like EQ is now going to be really fun, I
reminded him that he did have 175 days of previous fun with it, but he
said it's different knowing that he doesn't have to level anymore.
