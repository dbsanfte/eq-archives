Thanks for the help so far, gang.

Based on the advise here, which chimes well with advise received at Paladins of Norrath, I
think I'll...

1> Piggyback on a Phinny raid or...
2> Raid him myself, with my guild.

I imagine there's a few people here who have raided Phinny. Assuming most of my guild is
between 50 and 60 (with a few high-levels who are less commonly online), what will it take
to clear the path to Phinny's room, and out again?

How about a 2-person raid?  I have a 65 Shammy friend, or a couple of 65 Paladin friends.
Which level/classes of character can solo Phinny, or take him out with my assistance (50
Paladin, deals plenty DPS for my level)?  The attack would of course include drilling down
to Phinny's room and returning to the zone point safely.  

Thanks,

Best Regards,
