Yep, I can now change resolutions in the game, rather than
just by editing the .ini file.

Other than that, I haven't noticed any other changes.  The
fonts are still sometimes half-missing and the buttons (not
in-game, but the "Connect" and so-on) sometimes are missing
text until I hover the mouse over them.  Nothing major, and
the game itself works fine.
