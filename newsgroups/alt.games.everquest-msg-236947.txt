I've been to the plane of mischief several times in the last couple of
months just hunting mobs (skunks, fungus, bixies) near the zone in
area in the forest and also on the battlements by the invisible
bridge.  Problem is I'm having real problems   finding where I am as
it's one of the zones you can't map.  I've looked for maps and found a
couple.

Problem is that they bear no relataion to what I've seen.  Neither of
them show a forest or the zone in platform.  Neither of them show the
"funky skunk" marked on.

Are there two planes of mischief?  The one I am referring to is
enterred by clicking on the toy castle in the south of GD.
