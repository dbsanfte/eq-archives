Yeah, the sound was what I was thinking of.  Strikes me as odd in most
games when I see a 20 foot tall beastie coming at me whisper-quiet.
Maybe they got Nike's, miaybe they're giant ninja's, but it strikes me
as odd.

I can see how the rumbling could get annoying fast.  The boss-mob idea
sounds pretty cool though.  Maybe just for speical attacks though. I
haven't witnessed a G-Flux in EQ Live, so I can't say, but I always
think of the Tremor cannon in first PC Battlezone.

Does COH implement this in any way? Hulk smash?
