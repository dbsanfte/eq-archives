For some people, as I've said before, plunking down $50+ for the expansion isn't
really an option, even if for others its a trivial matter.  I had no problem
paying $23 for a copy myself, but I can certainly sympathize with kids living on
an allowance, or young people on a limited budget, and the fact that getting the
expansion in a hurry anywhere but the US means a significant cost increase...
well, I can certainly see why they'd wait.  Can't for you and can't for someone
else can mean two different things.
