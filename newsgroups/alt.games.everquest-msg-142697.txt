You were tagging mobs that happened to give both Coldain and CoV faction
hits. Were you fighting Tomax alligned storm giants in the arena, then
it wouldn't.

Not sure exactly what the issue is here. These method both work to fix
CoV faction, unless we're all getting stuck you the terminology of
somebody saying the two factions are "related" or something. (Which they
are not. You can get the same results in other ways by going on giant
faction, I believe. No others jump to mind.)

Now that I think about it, if you kill the dorfs running around outside
Thurg, do you get positive CoV hits? I know you don't for the Dain's
crew, though you get good giant faction there.
