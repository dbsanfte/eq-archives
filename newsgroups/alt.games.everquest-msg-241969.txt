Now that I have had some sleep....

Never had a problem with going windowed mode and back on my main computer.
My old one, Win XP Pro, Ti 5200, is the one, where if I leave it in windowed
mode, and in the background, for a while, it will then go to full black
screen and I have to use Task Manager to get out.  New comp P4 old P3, both
full Windows Updates, both using the v56.64 driver released 03/15/04.  The
new computer I never had a problem going to black, because it's never left
alone long enough while I'm playing EQ.
