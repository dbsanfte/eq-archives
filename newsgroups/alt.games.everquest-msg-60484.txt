Good point dstep.

When I read your response, it reminded me of everytime I go grocery
shopping.  Our town has three seperate "main" grocery store chains, and each
chain has two locations in town.  I have one store I usualy go to, but the
other store nearby ("Hy-Vee"), has DAMN fine honey-glazed fried chicken in
their dely.  Each store has their own customer card program, where you give
them your personal contact info and then you can save money when you present
your "card" at checkout.

Anyways, I'm not a fan of it, since the store compiles data about your
shopping habits, and sells the data to whomever will buy it -- especialy
telemarketers.

Everytime I walk in there, I get the same question, "Do you have your
EZ-save card?" I say no.  he/she says, "Do you want to sign up for it?" [as
he/she starts reaching for the paper forms.]  I say "No, I don't."  he/she
says, "Well, our card program can save you money when
you.......................[I tune him/her out at this point.]"  And the
cycle repeats everytime I shop at ANY of the stores in town.  (No
choice...can't run to a competitor's store since they do it too.)

What happened to the days when you could just walk in to any retail store
and buy something without proper identification?  When the person behind the
cash register didn't give a flying fuck who you were or what you were
buying?
