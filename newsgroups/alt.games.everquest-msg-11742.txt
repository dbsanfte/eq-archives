    Jazz, I play in small screen like you do. Whenever I want to get a
screenshot, though, I tap F10 twice, minus (screenshot) once, then F10.
Makes for better screenshots if you want just the picture, and not the text
etc. In this case the text really told part of the story - I would have gone
to full screen, taken screenshot, then cycled back to the small screen. That
is, if I'd already configured my full screen window to be optimal for taking
screenshots. ;-)
