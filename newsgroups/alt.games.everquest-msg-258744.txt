Yep, that's how I approached it. I headed for 65 first, then went 100% AAs
to get what I needed. When I apped for Reso, I needed a quick 75 AAs in
various things and did a lot of grinding to get there but it went pretty
fast, actually a LOT faster than if I'd split the goals along the way. I
don't recall how many AA I had when I quit the game, I think something over
150. I did AAs for maybe 5% of the time that I'd spent playing in my entire
career, they went that fast at 65.

There was one exception when I wasn't 100% one way or the other. I had gone
to 100% AA soon after hitting 65 and didn't leave much of an xp cushion.
When I joined Reso my playstyle changed dramatically and for the first time
in my career I was primarily raiding and this slowed down my exp. The other
big factor was GoD. I was one of the first to walk into Kod'Taz and I spent
many, many sessions in that zone without any rezzers around and ate a few
deaths, to the point where I actually lost 65 at one point.  That was a real
eye-opener for me. With all of the AA's that I still wanted to get, I didn't
want to go 100% xp for too long, but I also needed a good cushion so I reset
to 100% xp for a short time until I got about two yellows in. I then figured
that someday they would raise the level cap and it would be good to be close
to dinging, but it wasn't a high priority and I wanted to get back to my
AA's. So, I set up a 90% AA and then just forgot about it, and wound up
playing like that for the rest of my career. I am now at max experience,
ready to ding 66 if necessary, and reset to 100% AA. The 90% split turned
out to be a pretty good idea for that particular circumstance.
