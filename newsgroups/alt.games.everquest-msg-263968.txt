Well, reasonable people could differ on this but I think that at some point 
you need to take responsibiilty for your own shard recovery and I think a 
decent place to draw the line is this one, where each player has the sole 
responsibilitty for recovering their own shard and suffering the associated 
penalties if they don't, particularly since the penalty is so harsh relative 
to the debt that remains after recovery (which I believe is reasonable to 
share). Also, you can't control whether I will stay on another 2 hours 
tonight for a difficult shard recovery or even if I'll be on for the next 
couple of days, so you shouldn't have to carry the burden of the shard that 
remains unrecovered during the time that I've chosen to be absent.
