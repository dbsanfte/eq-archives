This really begs the question of why in the world you have IE open while
playing EQ if you can't switch back into EQ from it anyway?  There are all
sorts of 3rd party utilities, including some free ones to prevent those ads,
but again, just closing IE will take care of it.  Personally, when I play
EQ, nothing else is running on my system.
