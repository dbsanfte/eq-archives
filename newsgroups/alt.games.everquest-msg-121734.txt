You needed to leave that group, then. It was obviously a group with
melee in it. Melee need healing... simple fact. Running a melee group
without a healer is just asking for needless death. (Ok, there are
exceptions like five monk assault squads and such, but it's rare.) When
melee hit mobs, they get hit back and somebody has to heal them.

While probably the second or third *least* desirable choice, a necro
(particularly in the lower/mid levels, *can* do the job of the healer.
And sometimes there just isn't a cleric/druid/shammy around. When that's
the case, if you want to be part of the group, you stop being the killer
and start being the healer. You balance your HP and mana by tapping and
draining the mobs so you can keep pumping into the melee.

Believe me, in upper level encounters you will run into a parallel
effect, where instead of pumping HP into melee you will be needed to
pump mana into casters. It's known as mana-battery duty. Sounds like you
won't much like that either. But there's times where it's really called
for and an important role. And if you hate it that much, you can always
solo. You're still the best at that. (Well, with the possible exception
of a well outfitted quadding wizard, anyway. ;=)  ).
