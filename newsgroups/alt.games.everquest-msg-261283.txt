Let me cut and paste from my recent post on why I'm grinding intensely (or
as intensely as I can while still holding down a 9-5 job):

I feel the need to defend myself, so I will.  =)  Why wasn't I running
around looking at all the new stuff?  Why did I insist on immediately
grinding away XP in the old familiar places rather than try to experience
something different?  Well, let me tell you: it's because I dislike
grinding.  I remember how unfun it was to grind away 59 in Upper Dogs for a
week.  I have fond memories of that, sure, but only because it was an
unpleasant experience I endured to reach an important goal.  Actually
grinding for hours was darned boring.  But getting level 70 is very
important; those additional levels will make a lot of things much easier, as
well as allow me access to new spells.  So I want to get there as soon as
possible and put the unpleasantness of grinding behind me.  Once I hit 70
I'll be able to relax and enjoy myself.  It's like taking a bandage off; you
can peel it off slowly, making it less painful but dragging out the pain
over an extended period, or rip it off all at once, making one sharp but
brief pain.  I prefer brief.

How's that?  =)
