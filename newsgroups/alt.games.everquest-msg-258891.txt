So, following that line of arguement, your chance to proc would
actually be higher if you didn't have haste? 

I'm missing something here. If we assume a standard 40 delay 2 hander
with max dex and no proc AAs, it should proc about twice a minute from
the numbers I've seen. Whether you swing once every 4 seconds (no
haste) and have a 13% chance to proc per swing or you're at max haste,
swing once every 2 seconds and have 6.7% chance to proc per swing, I
don't see how one makes you proc more than the other.
