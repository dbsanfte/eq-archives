And if they start raiding later in their life, they're going to have to get
used to be very low down on the healing ladder indeed.  If you're in a
group with a cleric on a raid, there's a good chance they're on the MT
chain heal list.  If you're lucky, there's a backup healer in the group,
but their role is often to keep the cleric alive first, and everyone else
as an afterthought.

People need to get used to managing their aggro, and requiring a little
healing as possible (from any source), while putting in as much damage as
possible, or you end up with lazy folk who tank the front of mobs when
they're not MT, ignore the enrage message and keep going, nuke, get
summoned and then nuke again, etc., etc.
