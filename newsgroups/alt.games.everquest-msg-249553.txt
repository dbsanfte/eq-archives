I assume this means you'd keep the book in nexus active.  Otherwise PoK is 
almost as inaccessible as say, the Plane of Hate, which would be overdoing 
it a little. :)

Test one thing at a time... :) Make disabling /loc a second experiment.

Again, one thing at a time, if you want a controlled experiment. :)

I agree, you missed the point.  Even if you only tested one thing at a 
time, you still have a largely biased experimental pool.  My playtime in 
your experiment would be made miserable by all the people who have -never- 
lived without pok books etc's incessant whining.  It's like why trials 
frequently have to change venues to find an impartial jury.  In this case, 
though, I don't think the impartial jury exists to be found anymore.

The contention of the anti-quick-access people isn't that travel features 
should be undone; rather, that they -never- should have been added to such 
a scale.

The world got bigger with PoP.  Some additional travel feature was 
necessary.  They could have continued the spires idea, and that would have 
been reasonable.  But PoK books was overkill.  What if, rather than the 
spires, it was found that assorted druid rings, about one per continent, 
could take you to PoK?  Say, the one in Steamfont, the one in Feerott, 
the one in Toxx, and add new stonehenges in EJ and Wakening Land (or use 
the dragon ring, sure, but it would be good to have the landing spot away 
from Wuoshi. :) ), and possibly one to eerm, Twilight Sea or Grimling.  
And keep some instant connection to the Nexus.  Heh, they could also 
possibly have had direct routes to OOT and Tim Deep.  There's even a ring 
in OOT...

That would have been a reasonable compromise, in my opinion.  Instant 
travel to -every- city was just too much.  It would also have fit 
reasonably into game lore.  Druids adapted the techniques of Wizards, and 
discovered the Plane of Knowledge, rahter than the Nexus.

}The point of the week long trial is to show that removing the travel

}anything but fun in actual play. All this mythizing the past is funny
}to me.. but in reality you'd have a lot of pissed off people from the
}unweildiness of it all. It would be kind of like wearing a throwback
}uniform for a week :>. Ahh ya.. i remember those.... now back to
}normal kk!

It would be anything but fun for those who had experienced having the PoK 
book system, aye.  But I maintain the worlds of Norraht would be a better, 
more interesting place if there had -never- been a PoK book system.

}And plus... nobody forces you to use the travel features. Delete your
}LoY maps and only use druid and wizard ports to get anywhere.

Ahh, now, y'see, I have no urge to take boats all alone.  Where's the fun 
in that?  Most of the point of traveling in this game was the opportunity 
to share the experience with traveling companions.  But as others have 
said, this argument has been shot down dozens of times now.
