lol - no balancing for us or BL's!  :)

Well, one thing, get rid of the lore tag
on our focus items and/or make them a targetable
summons.  Simply a convenience issue :)

Funny thing is - at 61 I don't use Firebolt of Tallon
much, SoFB is still my nuke of choice

http://members.cox.net/jmattcrews/mageddchart.xls

If you go to the link above and enter 61 as the 
level, conjuration as the spec, Gallenite's (20%)
as the magic/fire damage modifier and Jolums (15%)
as the mana focus - you'll see the the very best
SoFB cast has a 4.824:1 ratio

Remove the Gallenite's focus from the damage boxes (as I
don't have the 61 bracelet) and look at FoT - you'll
see a 4.66:1 ratio (best case)

add to that it's a bolt (ever lost 500mana when someone
stepped in front of your nuke?) and it just doesn't get
in my spell lineup.

Usually it goes 2 nukes (fire/magic) Burnout4, 2 pet
heals (the recast on ours is obscene),Mod Rod 2, Flameshield
of Ro and Malosini.  I just don't have room for a little
used nuke.
