It's a bit faster than original boats.

Roughly every 10 or 15 minutes for Butcherblock to OoT run.

I haven't seen any differences.  Mostly nothing bothers me as most mob
don't usually chase after someone 70 levels higher.

But some still fall into the water on zoning because they zoned slower
than the board, and miss the boat.  Swimming time again!

Just FYI, they took out most of the translocators (maybe all?).  Only
thing left are the magus for some zones.
