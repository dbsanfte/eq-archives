Well, if you go by "what class can use" then thats not NBG, so we are talking
apples and oranges.  But certainly since you *all* knew that the Pitiful Drop
Item wasn't going to be an upgrade for anyone just giving it to the guy who was
the right class seems silly too...

I totally agree.  If you are happy with your circle of friends I wouldn't
bother to add a stranger.  And if you do, agree on loot rules *right up front*.
 I did a LDON once w/3 guildies where the warrior and rogue rolled on an int
aug planning to give it to the necro if they won.  I thought that was pretty
*loot whorish* too.  I don't remember who won, but I remember the guild name
well enough.
