And this, I think, is where one can say "thank god for twinks".  It makes 
us untwinked ones so much 'richer' *g*

Okay, so at about level 3 I got involved in this conversation and soon a 
guy sends me a tell asking where I am, and then telling me to come to the 
POD lift, and I show up and he loads me up with 30 plat and leather armor 
and a scimitar.

I mean... I can't REFUSE the kind gentleman... can I? :D

(But I still loot rotting corpses)
