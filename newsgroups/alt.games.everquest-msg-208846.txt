Hello dumbass.

Yes.

 On a massive scale?

Also yes.

Again. Yes.

They are, as you say, virtually infinite. This question is meaningless. You
test what you can think of.

This what the 'test' server is for. For something non-gameplay related like
ldon preorder... where it can't be 'tested' on 'test' effectively... then
you debug it extra hard.

They're usually called clusters or farms, not helpers. Yes.

10 or 20,000 subscribers is small potatoes to ISPs, banks, telcos, cable
carriers, etc etc etc.

More importantly... what is selfish about expecting the service you
subscribe to be 'the service you subscribed to'? If you signed up for online
payments and found your credit card cancelled as result... or if you added
voicemail to your cell phone and found all your free minutes for the month
used up as a result... you cry foul. And rightly so. Its one thing for a
company to have the odd hiccup, SOE has a chronic case of them. They have
never launched anything without a major hitch... of some sort.

Not own it no, but soe has their hand in that pie in a big way.

On that we agree.
