I'm a 21 hafling druid, and I'm interested in killing some dark elf guards. 
I'm sure I can kill most of them by now, if not soloing, then with one other
person.  My only concern was whether these are bad things for faction.  Most
dark elves are kos to me; however, some aren't.  The ones in West Commons (not
kizdean gix, but the lieutenants by the EC zone) are indifferent.  By killing
nek guards, would I lower my faction with delves like these?  Thanks for the
info!
