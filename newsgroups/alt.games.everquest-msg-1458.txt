Get into the mid 50's and your tune will change.  Necro sucks to bring
on raids.  Well, one necro is good but bringing multiple necros along
is a waste of space.  People make arguments that go along the lines of
know how to use the class, be a jack of all trades, yada yada.  It's
possible to do anything, shit.  I can drive my car with my feet but I'm
not going to do it.  The sky's the limit if you put your mind to it and
be creative.  But take a necros best skills, good DoTs, nice pet, throw
them away because they're dangerous to use on raids post lvl 50, and
what are you left with?  a whole lot less, maybe nothing at all.

BTW, at lvl 8 you can make a lvl 9 pet.  No wonder you're amped about
the class.  That enthusiam will change with 40 more lvls tho,
guaranteed.
