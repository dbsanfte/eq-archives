I'm on AB and I know that before the 15 minutes were up (like 5 minutes left
or so) there was another message stating that the servers will be down soon
and that they know about the zoning crashes and port problems. Most of my
group didn't even dare to gate or port at that time so we just logged
wherever we were.
