On Saryrn EW is generally not a good pickup zone. If you can bear the
chatter, OT for a few more levels then DL will provide an abundance of work
for a healer.

But if you just want a place to partner up, then you can't beat dungeons for
xp. It's been a while since I was 34 so maybe a few others can suggest a
nice indoor zone.
