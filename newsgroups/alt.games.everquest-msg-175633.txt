There's already a planned expansion zone for that building.  Veksar? 
Something like that.  It keeps getting put off though, so I doubt it'll ever
get released anytime soon.

The website is pretty explicit about it being in the swamps in southern
Antonica.  It will almost certainly be off either Innothule or Feerott, or
off a new zone that is connected to them.

It's always possible that they will revamp Upper Guk, but I doubt it.  While
Guk certainly is a city, it's got a very unfriendly and mazelike layout for
a newbie starting city.
