IMHO, the only real choice for tradeskills are the pet classes. Why,
you ask? Because a pet makes it a hell of a lot easier to farm greens,
which you will be doing a lot of. Plus the pet classes (beastlord,
mage, necro, shaman) all rely on wis or int, which is also helpful
with those tradeskill skillups.
