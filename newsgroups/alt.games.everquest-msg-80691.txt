The druids are very touchy. They attack anyone "impure", and some who just
strayed a little too sometimes ;)

My little druid (25) was showing off to her big sis (a friend, 60 dru) who
ported in to say hallo by charming a gorge hound. She waited patiently at the
ring for sis to arrive, and as she did charm broke. Oops. No biggy you'd think,
just recharm.

The druids at the ring have no sense of solidarity. They saw me, little druid,
and gorge hound, eating little druid. They immediately sided with the gorge
hound as big sis stared flabbergasted as they rooted me and started to pummel
me. 

She was astonished. "How the hell did you get KoS to druids? Even I'm not!", but
not as astonished as I was ;) 

Luckily, I grouped with her and she succored me out, still rooted, to the zone
line on the wooden bridge.

Now, if I'd been a troll and those uppity little cantankerous gits had decided
I needed to be exterminated I'd be very tempted to extemrinate them right back 

;)
