The invalid assumption here is that the CHeal will go off at 600 hit
points regardless of whether the tank is buffed or not.  Clerics heal
based on bubbles of health showing, which is a percentage of the
tank's health, not an absolute number.  One fifth of our buffed tank's
health is 676.  So that's 2704 HP on the buffed tank.  But with that
ammendation, I grant your argument, and I never said I didn't buff
(and Symbol) my tanks.  But this is all about mana efficiency (and
yes, I realize I used the word first).  And note that it revolves
entirely around the fact that CHeal doesn't heal a set number of hit
points, so if your healer isn't a cleric it doesn't apply at all.

The point I was addressing was that the notion that an extra 100 hit
points (from a stamina buff) or even 380 (from Heroism) are going to
save a tank's life in a given battle is probably erroneous, or at
least happens so infrequently that it might as well be.  Because for
those 100 hit points to matter, all your healers would have to be
totally out of mana AND you get beaten down that low AND you somehow
manage to survive the encounter (and if your healers are oom and
you're down under 100 hit points, I'm not giving good odds on you
surviving).  Or the CHeal kicks in just as we're down into the last
100 hit points.  Sure, these things happen, but how often really?
Once an evening?  Not in my experience.  Once a week?  Maybe, if
you're living on the edge.
