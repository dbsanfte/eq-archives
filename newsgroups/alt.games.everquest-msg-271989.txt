I believe that's how it works. Otherwise, groups would kill solo mobs
-- they could kill them much faster and with less risk.

You'll note that in group encounters, you usually see 'You get bonus
experience for defeating this encounter!'. You get this if you're in a
group or if you kill a 'group' mob solo. (This makes green group mobs
good for solo players. I can usually defeat up to green++ encounters
solo, and could probably do blue++ if I had better gear and upgrades.)
