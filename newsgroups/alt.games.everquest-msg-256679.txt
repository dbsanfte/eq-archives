Ah, no, I attack his target, kill it, and THEN pick a second target,
and third and fourth and so on till there aren't any more mobs to kill.

Just worded it poorly I think, thats not what I meant, I meant I tank 
his pull and then pick the next ones, one at a time.

Trouble with that is that the puller might not be acting as MA; he might 
be snaring an add or he might have someone in the group targetted and be 
binding sight to them so he can see himself coming in or... well, he 
might be doing practically anything.  If he's designated as the MA thats 
his responsibility, to pick the target and everyone assist him.  But if 
the MT is also the MA, then its his job to pick.  I usually do pick by 
assisting puller, but the rest of the group doesn't need to know what 
arcane process I'm using at the moment, just need to know who to assist 
and when.

When I give my targetting message, that means assist me because I won't 
be changing target till this one is dead (except for emergencies where 
the mezzer calls for a switch).  But even then I don't mean you can 
damage the mob, I want to break mez every time, ideally.  This is 
problematic on the first mob in the room because he's probably not going 
to be mezzed at all.  But my stun is insta cast and on the first mob of 
a pull, I'm not likely to have to wait for it to cycle anyway.
