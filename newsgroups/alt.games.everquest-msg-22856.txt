Hi,

Got my alt Druid up to 22 last night (He is going to catch my main
soon).
Now I'm looking for somewhere that I can solo, since I only play him
solo.

Thing is I got the last 2 levels with quests so my skills may be a bit
lacking.
I was maxed out at 20, but 2 levels in 2 night with no fighting must
have put a dent in my casting defence / offence etc.

So I'm looking for an outside zone where I can solo and get my skills
up, with little risk <G>.

Oh and can anyone guess the quest that can take a druid (by my
estemation) from 19 to 24 in 15 RL hours ? 
I might tell you if you pester me enough.

Cheers,

Jim
