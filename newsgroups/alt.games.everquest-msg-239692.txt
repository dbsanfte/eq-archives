:
: Supposedly Clans (Guilds) can own Castles and Hideouts (etc..). During
: the times when they are vulnerable, (several hours at scripted times)
: other clans can sign up to lay siege to other clans castles. Also
: supposedly clans can come in to ownership of smaller things like
: Hideouts by defending them from monsters (PvE). The thing that makes
: it seem really cool is that once you take control of a castle you can
: set the taxes (etc..) for the town under that castles control. Also
: guilds can conquer other castles to eventually become ruler of the
: world. Very interesting concept, I'm just waiting on the execution.

online world.  Why is it better to control the world than save it?
