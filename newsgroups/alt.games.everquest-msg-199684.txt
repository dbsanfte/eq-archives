That one second buys you almost 30% more damage.  With focus items that 
only work on 60 and under spells, it buys you potentially more damage, with 
more mana efficiency.  Not to mention with spell haste, that one second is 
reduced as well.

I won't pretend to know the intricacies of playing a wizard, I've only 
played one to level 11.  I do know that when you want to kill something 
NOW, you mix your nukes so as to reduce time between recasting.  You still 
would use the ones that will inflict the most damage the fastest.  If all 
you have is focus III items available, then I think you will find that your 
level 60 and under spells will be most efficient, both in mana, and in kill 
time.  To be sure, I'd have to really dig into the various spells, and the 
exact effects of the focus items, but, I would be surprised if that were 
not the case.
