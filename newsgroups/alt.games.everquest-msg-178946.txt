If you have Luclin then Paludal Caverns is the place to be at your level.
Most people at about 15th level move on to PC and thats why you don't see
them in the other zones anymore. PC is the best experience in the game at
any level, it never gets any better.

I've never played a Bard, but from what I hear, they only get better as they
level.  So don't give up on your Bard, I'm sure you will love the class.

By the way, everyone gets into slumps in the game when they don't know what
to do next and they get bored.  Take a break or start and alt, come back
when you feel like it.
