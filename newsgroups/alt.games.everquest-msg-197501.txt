Similar, but I've just wasted lots of time. I'd send myself a message
about it, saying not to bother since it is a huge timesink and
something I'll only do when bored and alone. I'd also include that my
mother should have a heart stress test and start taking anti stroke
medication, because she will be dead three years from that time =/
My father will also be dead, but his was cancer and nothing could be
done even going back in the past.

Oh, and of course the 9/11 thing. Big duh there. I'd tell my past self
to wait until like 3 am the night before and then call the FBI/World
trade center security/etc and tell them that the planes would be
hijacked by some arab looking individuals with box knives. Of course
my past self would be all crashed out after playing EQ or something,
though I told them to stay away from that crap, then they'd wake up
the next morning and get on the internet  at 10 am just like I did and
go "OH crap!"

If I could go back as far as when I was 18, with my first significant
other, I'd tell myself to stay with them for they were truely the love
of my life. Being my first, I was ignorant of this at the time and
thought I shoud get more experience, breaking their heart. I called
them up two years later but it was too late. I missed the love of my
life and no truer love I will ever find.

OH, and I'd buy www.news.com, since the guy who had it sold it to cnet
or someone for 400 k dollars (I almost said PLAT AHAHAHHA)

yeah, 

news.com
various obvious porn.com
internet.com
stock.com
stocks.com
investing.com

etc

Trademark ones do you no good, since the person can just sue
to get their trademarked website name back.
