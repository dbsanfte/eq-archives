A necro can only mez mobs up to 55th lvl, depending on what lvl of
dungeon. you were doing, he might not have been able to mez. 

As for your original comment. one nice thing about going the
root/atone route is those annoying pets (especially air) that insist
on breaking root with their procs. Using root/atone you have a pretty
good chance of ducking agro. Odds are decent that either root will
hold long enough for the pet to gain agro or that atone will work and
pet gains agro that way. I don't know if atone is really worth the
mana in that situation but it's certainly worth a bit of testing.
