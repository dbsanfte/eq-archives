}See, now I wish I would have written down that guys name that was at the
}Tradeskill open forum at the Mpls Fan Faire a while back. When asked about
}this exact question he responed and indicated, that you are more "likely" to
}gain a skill up on items that are closer to your current skill level.

My anecdotal and subjective experience is that you're slightly more likely 
to get a skillup if you're working on something about 7-10 points above 
your skill in trivial.  There's about a million ways I could be fooling 
myself about that, though, of course.

You should be warned, though, that in JC it is -true- suffering from about 
180 to 210, then it eases up a bit again for the rest of the way.  Welcome 
to the hump! :) I don't have a good reason for -why- it's like that, but 
there it is.

}Now any of us jewlcrafters, and other tradeskillers, know that it stinks to
}go out and buy 2 stacks of coponents for a close trival and get your skill
}ups before you burn through the first stack.
}
}This is why I tend to pick something out a few steps higher. Just makes for
}less trips to the merchants.
}
}That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

And a good story it is. :)
