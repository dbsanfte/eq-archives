There are no hit locations, hits just do damage. How much damage you
do and whether you hit depends on a lot of variables (skills, class,
level, strength, damage bonus, attack bonus, etc), though.  I haven't
played AC for more than about 15 minutes so I don't know how it works
there.

The most damage gets the exp.  Killing a mob someone else has started
on without their permission is against the rules, though (kill
stealing), though given the number of games you've played you probably
knew taht.

Yes, as above.

AC is a combination of several factors, both avoidance and mitigation,
so you could say it does both.  The displayed AC also includes your
defense skill.

See above (i.e. lots of things).

Mobs give (level * level) xp, multiplied by the XP modifier in the zone
you kill them (a list of the Zone Experience Modifiers for most zones
is at http://www.rpgexpert.com/441.html[0], some of them may have
changed but mostly it's accurate).  So basically it's all about level,
and mobs that con the same can be different levels, especially blue
and light blue ones.

[0] Ignore the "Experience Modifier" percentage, that's just the
author not understanding maths
