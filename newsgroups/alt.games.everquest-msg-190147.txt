No, he's better off playing a class he likes.
Bards aren't tanks, but then they have MANY
other things to bring to a duo.

A mage might be a good partner - just don't
melee.  Let the pet tank, the bard can slow
and stack a couple of chants indoors, or
snare fear outdoors.  I've played a bard as
well as my mage - and I'd have loved to that
duo.

Shaman or Druid, with the bard stacking chants
on top of their dots.

Necro, same as mage - except health regen is
a godsend for them.
