I totally agree.  I've been in *a* group where there was no talking whatsoever.
 I'm guessing they had their own chat channel or guild talk.  Whatever.  I
mentioned a couple of times how quiet it was.  No response.  Then one of them
piped up outa nowhere about how we should all disband so that one guy could get
all the experience as he was close to leveling.  I did so promptly, and walked
off.  How very rude.

If you want to play with your friends that's cool.  But don't invite other
people into your group then ignore them.  Just say you don't need more in your
group.
