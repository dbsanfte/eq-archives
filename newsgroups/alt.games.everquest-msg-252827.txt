These things are intended pretty much solely to help a Warrior acting in a
group as a tank to hold agro. The throwing of stones is kinda funny to me
actually, as I have always had in my warrior taunt macro a "/em sticks his
tongue out at %t" as a comment on the effectiveness of taunt. Seems someone
at SOE has a sense of humor too.

I havent yet seen or heard of a /doability type command for the new combat
abilities yet... but I hope they do as I too would like to add it to my
macros.
