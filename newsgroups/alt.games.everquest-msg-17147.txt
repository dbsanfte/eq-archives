1.  These newsgroups are part of Usenet, not the web.

2.  HTML is a web standard, NOT a Usenet standard.

3.  A lot of people are using newsreaders that don't support HTML posts.

4.  An HTML post needs a lot more Internet bandwidth and server storage
space than the plain-text posts that are standard on Usenet.

5.  Many people are paying by the minute for telephone service and Internet
access.

6.  Some major ISPs filter out HTML posts in newsgroups, so their customers
don't have to put up with them.

See number 1 and 2 above: the Web is NOT Usenet, and has different
standards.  HTML is the standard for the web and is supported by web
browsers.  Plain-text is the standard for Usenet; many news readers don't
support HTML.


Finally, I'm going to mildly flame you...

From your posts, you obviously know almost nothing at all about Usenet: how
it works, what the posting guidelines are, why those guidelines exist, etc.

Yet, despite not knowing what you were talking about, you still jumped in
here and started complaining about people who expect posters to comply with
those long-standing guidelines.

Sorry, but in my book that is just plain dumb and rude.  :-(  Before you
start telling people they don't know what they're doing, show a little
courtesy and common sense by trying to find out what's going on before you
start yelling at people.
