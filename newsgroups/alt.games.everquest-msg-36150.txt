Thanks for the response. I forgot to add that I am running ME.
The game just freezes up like got serious packet loss. The P/L meter
goes from zero to red back to zero. I have my anti-virus set to not
scan. I use Norton Anti-virus and have failed to figure out how to
shut it down without icon on taskbar. Again thanks for response.
Hoping to hear from others who have similiar problems with possible
solutions.
