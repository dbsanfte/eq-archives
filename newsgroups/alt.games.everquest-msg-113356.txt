Pretty crazy, but id go to butcherblock, firiona vie. beg a bind, beg a sow,
run to DL, loot all the crap that noone can be bothered with. Die. Appear
back in FV with all your gear, sell bank, beg/buy anouther sow etc etc. You
should have enough to outfit yourself in leather and a decent weapon in a
few hours (not couting time to get there). There may even be a soulbinder at
FV. sow isnt essential either, so what if you die.

Almost an exploit. Im not sure what level you start leaving a corpse when
you die, might be best to check that out.
Once you have about 50p worth, you should be able to outfit yourself in some
banded armor (/join auction, and say you're buying banded armor), and buy a
fine steel weapon. Dont buy weapons from merchants... you can run to rathe
mountains or south karana and pick one up for a few pp. (maybe even loot one
for nothing in rm).
