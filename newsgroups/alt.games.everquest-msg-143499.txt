Yeah well, SK's spells make up for lack of discs.

Bleh you get better than monks do!

MGB, critical heals, better heals, longer buff durations, bestow DA (bards
should never have had this song in the first place..), a mana free heal
(keke).. and best of all, a 100% exp rez, no rez effects, no loss of mana

Seriously though, 133 AA.. and I feel screwed by VI in relation to other
classes.  I have NO damage increase over other classes, i have NO super
damage short duration thing, I have nothing thats flash and fun, albeit
useless.. i have fuck all.

Rangers - AM3/EQ3...  Rogues - Chaotic stab (the ability to BS from the
front of a mob?  gee talk about damage)
Chanters - dire charm mobs that quad for 202+... god even necros and druids
can Direcharm.. necros and wizards (mana burn, life burn).

All of those blow monks away for DPS

Monks are a damage dealing class.. where the hell are our damage dealing
abilities?
