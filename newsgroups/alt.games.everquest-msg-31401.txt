When I was doing my PAW quest, this was one of the easier rings.  Yes...just
kill anything that spawns at the ent way.  Rat..skel...mummy doesnt matter.
I've went down there and killed the Mob twice and gotten the Plat ring both
times.  First time was after prob about 20 minutes or so...the second time
was 2 hours.  If I remeber correctly, the 2 hour camp he spawned a few
times, but didnt have the plat ring.  I would jus say wait it out.  If ya
get board kill the other skels and rats and such...but jus dont leave your
spot.  It would be real easy to miss the spawn of another rat/skel or what
not and have no way of knowing that was the Place holder
