SKs solo just fine up to 65 at least, I am sure beyond that as well.  Third 
best tank?  Personally, from my experiences with all 3 tank types, for xp 
groups, SKs are on par with the other two.  Agro is never an issue with an 
SK or Paladin, equipment is on par between the two.  I am quite curious why 
you would call them third best?
