Yes.  Empathy is really the "cleric" subset of powers, with heals, cures,
defensives buffs, and, of course, rez.

Not all Defenders choose Empathy, of course, but most do.  Right now if you
say you're a Defender most everyone will assume you've chosen Empathy; the
common wisdom is Defender = healer.  Some choose not to go that way; I
teamed with a Defender who disdained healing and did lots of other cool
stuff instead.  =)
