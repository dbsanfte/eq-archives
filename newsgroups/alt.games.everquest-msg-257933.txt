Like tyas said, the ds doesnt count, but there's something else weird when
pling with nukes.
Last time I was pling with my chanter, If I dropped a 1k+ nuke on a mob that
the pl'ee had down to 49% or less (without ds), I could still ks him. It
seemed like it gave me 1k+ damage worth of credit even if the mob only had
500 hp to begin with. Try smaller nukes, just enough to drop the mob 40%, or
less if using ds. The damaging root spells would be a good option, keep the
mob beating on the ds & do a little damage at the same time.
