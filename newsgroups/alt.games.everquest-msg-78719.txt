Sure about that? I'd be fairly sure it has a bonus over standard outdoor
zones, what with being a dungeon an' all. Remember the only ZEM (zone
experience modifier) figures Verant has ever published were CHANGES to the
existing ZEMs, to encourage use of under-utilised dungeons. CoM has always
been reasonably popular IME, which would explain why it didn't get a boost.
