    Well at 51 he would've conned white to me and so perhaps we'd at least
have medded to full first :)

    I don't think summoning would have effected the outcome of that battle
too much - 3 of us were meleeing him constantly anyway.

    Cazel summons too and I actually zoned away from him after a very
stuffed solo attempt <g> (ooh yellow giant..... hrm named.......
hmmmmmmm........ resist eh? OW! 220 whats??? I *HT* you....... hey that
didn't do much...... my hitpoint bar! tima run!)
