Well, I have been out of the live games for a while, and am going to
start over at level 1.
No twink
No guild
Nothing. Whole new server where I don't know anyone.

Thinking of a Shadowknight. How are they now (about a year since I
have played to any real extent)?

Also curious about Beastlords. Pro and con of the class?

I am still familiar with the mechanics and such, as my time away has
been working on and with the EQ emulator. I have been in game
gathering spawn points, pathing, and loot tables, just not to play
with any seriousness.
The emu is pretty much finished, so I am going back in the live
servers to play.
Emulation is cool for a home LAN game with friends, as a DM
tool/campaign creation, etc. Nothing beats a server full of people to
interact with, though. Frankly, I can't afford the fat pipe and
monster servers it would take to make one, and Sony would drop a 2 ton
lawyer shaped anvil on anyone who tried.

eqemu.sourceforge.net for the curious.
