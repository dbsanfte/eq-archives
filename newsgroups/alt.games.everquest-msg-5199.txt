	I got my bf reading the ng here and posting, but I've not seen
anything of his yet.  We use two different newsgroup servers (I w/
Airnews and he w/ our local isp).  I think he's only posted one
message so far, but I'm not sure.  He posts under av[1].  Did it go
through?  I just d/l'ed more messages a couple of minutes ago and I'm
still not seeing anything (which is pretty much why I don't use our
isp's ng server--tho I won't have a choice much longer).
