	Ok, here's the scoop:

	The best way to handle the elves is to have someone pull them 
all at once and kite them away then mezz them.  Once the pesky elves
are gone you have 8 nameds and then a kind of miniboss, that's the one
with the AOE blind.  You can do this with two groups, one nice and
one naughty.  Leave the naughty group outside with the elves, and
zone the good group into Santa's Workshop (if you haven't gotten the
key from Mrs. Claus you can have a rogue pick the lock).

	The 8 nameds aren't really hard.  The main problem is that they
fly around at like bard speed so they're hard to target.  Get them to 
stand still by tossing Kromdul Carrots - the ones you forage in Warslik's -
into a corner.  For some reason, maybe it's a bug, these things aggro on
the carrots and as long as the carrots are there you can nuke em and they
won't budge.  When these 8 are dead a mini pops, Rude Dolf the Red or 
something like that.  He's a bit tougher and won't fall for the carrot
trick, but if you laugh and call him names it seems to keep him stunned
so he doesn't cast that red light thing.

	The real boss was a bit of a let down.  He looked pretty tough, 
sort of like a combination of Grummus and Zeus, but the MT pulled his
beard a few times and he broke down in tears.  A few rounds later we
saw the "Santa's corpse lets out a final hohoho and collapses like a
bowlful of jelly" message, and that was that!  He dropped a whole *bagful*
of loot.

	I got a striped sweater and two Beanie Babies, but lost the 
roll for the bicycle. Oh, and we got a bunch of candy canes and other 
vendor trash/tradeskill junk from the elves.
