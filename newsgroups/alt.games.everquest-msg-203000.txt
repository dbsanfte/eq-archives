You pegged it, this is exactly what it does.  On summoning it immediately
buffs itself - HOWEVER - people have managed to get it to attack without
prebuffing by spamming /pet attack as the pet summon finishes.  With
a mage with QS3, that resummon time is 5 seconds.  If you were reliably
able to get it to attack as soon as it appears, that wouldn't be too
bad.

That said - it casts for about 45 seconds before (we assume) going OOM,
at which time it wades into the melee.  For that 45 seconds, tests have
put it's DPS at 135.  Some people have found it useful in one of the
shorter boss fights in the elementals (don't remember which, sorry) by
having one that has pre-buffed itself in suspension, and one up.  
/pet attack - 45 seconds later it moves to melee, reclaim, unsuspend,
/pet attack.  This particular fight lasts around 90 seconds anyway, so
it does infact boost a mage's damage for that time period.
