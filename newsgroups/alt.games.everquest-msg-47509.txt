Today I died twice from porting into WC.  I'm pretty sure the first
time I was not encumbered; the second time I was carrying 3 pounds too
much.  Then it's nervewracking to teleport back in to retrieve my
corpse.  

Is there a way to circumvent falling injuries or reduce them when the
screen is shaking like that?  There seems to be a small window of
opportunity to do something.  Would it be better to not have sow on?
I got hit twice, accumulating over 600 points of damage where I have
about 550 HP.  

I will teleport to WC with levitiate from now on.  To be on the safest
side, I suppose I should do the same for every port.  I'm poor, so
I'll have to hunt bats for quite awhile.   

I remember experience the same bug back in my newbie days.  I was an
Erudite and when I died, I died again from falling at my bind point
due to someone sitting/standing there... over and over again.  

I watched people porting in and noticed some people bouncing around,
but only one had falling damage and he didn't die.  Just my bad luck,
I guess.
