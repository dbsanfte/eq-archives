My guild and a few members from our allied guilds took down Bertie
tonight.  Raid was 37 toons averaging level 67, very unbalanced
towards melee.  We had only 1 Enchanter on the raid which made things
fun at the end.  The poor Chanter died from room spawns while we were
taking the last named through the bottom 5% of his HP.  When the named
went down a few moments later, Bertie spawned and promptly chewed -
unslowed, mind you - through our tank order in nothing flat.  Somehow
we managed to pull off a full recovery and took the win as the event
timer warnings were popping up in chat.  Whew!

My Guided Meditation now looks like the example below.  I need only
Agnarr and SolRo to be fully EP flagged.

Now that I have completed the Bertoxx line, might I be able to zone
into SolRo's chambers for this weekend's raid, even though I lack the
Agnarr flag?

Even if I have to be gimped into the chambers for this Saturday's
raid, if we are successful in killing SolRo, I should be able to do
some hailing, then zone into PoF...correct?

I expect that PoA, PoE and PoW will remain closed to me until I have
the Agnarr flag.
