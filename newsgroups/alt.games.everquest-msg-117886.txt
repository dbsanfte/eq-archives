One thing I would like to know as a relatively new player (about 3 
months) is how can a wizard solo? I was under the impression that 
wizards can't solo very well. The main reason why I created a mage 
instead of a wizard is because although I do like fighting in groups, I 
didn't want to be totally reliant on playing in a group. With a mage I 
can use my pet to draw agro and take damage while I stand back and cast. 
  Enchanters have pets and necro's have pets too. With a druid you can 
use a combo of snare/root, SoW and DoT spells to solo, but what do you 
use as a Wizard?
