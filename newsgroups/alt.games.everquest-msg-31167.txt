And can I smirk a little too, since I restarted my druid when Jakys
was level 9 and working on monk faction and am now 47?
(You beat me with your alts. Mine are only 7, 8 and 14. Drat :) )

would on average gain 2 levels in 3 days, spending 3 days on 30 and 2
on 35. I had streaks where I dinged every day for over a week.
