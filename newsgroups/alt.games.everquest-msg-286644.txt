If ever there was a "part time" adventurer, I would be it.  I've been a 
subscriber since the year EQ launched, but I've never managed to play in 
anything but spurts with large gaps in between.  While others got 
"uber", I simply crawled along.  I was reading this newsgroup when it 
took nearly an hour each night just to read the threads that interested 
me.  My intermittent play style has left me in a state of having 
forgotten much more about EQ than I currently know.  And I have not kept 
up with all that the newest expansions have to offer.  As a result, I 
have what may be considered an odd, and perhaps backward set of equipment.

In the spirit of helping my crew of fashion victims, I ask those 
adventurers who still stop by this newsgroup for some desperate help. 
With only about 10k in the shared bank, and a playstyle that isn't 
conducive to raiding or even a lot of what players today would consider 
adequate grouping, how can I best address any deficiencies in these 
fellows' gear?

THE FASHION VICTIMS:

Okosar
Male Gnome Enchanter
Level 55
Profile URL : http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1367187

Okosar is the oldest fellow I regularly play.  I thought he was on the 
way to being a sharp dresser, but I woke up one day after he won his 
Grandmaster jewellcrafting trophy after much work to max it out at 250, 
only to discover that he'd been demoted as the level cap raised.  A trip 
over to the Trader's Corner to see what he'd have to do revealed to me 
that to really be considered a tradeskiller, you have to have 300 in all 
tradeskills (2100 Club?).  Is that even possible without getting the AA 
skill?  Speaking of AA's, Okosar was so distraught at the tradeskilling 
setback and the very slow leveling after hitting 52, that he never 
earned any.  He has the veteran rewards.  This little Gnome needs some 
direction.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saurthos
Male Iksar Shaman
Level 33
Member of <Triumvirate of Hate>
Profile URL : http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1367188

Saurthos has been hitting the hotzones, and he loves it.  Iksars have 
very specific fashion needs, though, as much of the gear available seems 
to rub his scales the wrong way.  I have a feeling he's going to go on a 
growth spurt soon, but I'm sure his wardrobe isn't up to the task.  This 
Iksar needs some soloing gear.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zeyos
Male Vah Shir Warrior
Level 28
Profile URL : http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1367190

Zeyos has been partner to a shaman since they were both kittens. 
However, his feline friend has become an even more sporadic player than 
I.  At one time, a long time ago, a rich benefactor retired and willed 
Zeyos some higher end warrior items (Zeyos didn't even ask "CIHYS?" - 
begging has never been our way).  Because of this, he might be okay in 
gear, but a lot has passed since then, and some other caster friends are 
nearing his level, so he might have some new partners to tank for soon. 
  This Vah Shir needs to be ready for them (and a potential "regular" 
group).
------------------------------------------------------------------
Asiphlan
Male Erudite Paladin
Level 26
Profile URL : http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1367191

Probably the oddest character I've taken under my wing, he's the most 
obvious example of my penchant for making unusual race-class 
combinations.  Not only is this Erudite indeed a paladin, he's not a 
Prexus Deepwater Knight one, he's a follower of Quellious.  He has an 
odd collection of things from the time he's spent in the bazaar selling 
my old odds and ends.  He's also in that mid-twenty "sweet spot" where a 
couple of my RL friends have characters nearing, so his grouping time 
may be on the rise very soon.  This Erudite needs to be the best 
"tank-like" character a hybrid can be.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Amphar
Male Froglok Cleric
Level 25
Profile URL : http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1367192

My new favorite, this guy's been hanging out with casters too much. 
He's served as a tank for his 20's, and probably will for awhile longer 
as his best friend seems to be a wizard.  Still, this "Battle Cleric" 
would like to start acquiring things that might allow him to expand more 
in the traditional cleric way at some point in the future.  This Froglok 
needs to grow.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Caedwin
Male Human Bard
Level 27
(no Magelo profile)

My original character is probably the worst dressed.  *No magical 
instruments* and only a couple of Lambent pieces along with a couple of 
cold iron pieces.  Want to start playing him again, after I learned 
about the "melody" command in the FAQ.  This human wants to be a REAL BARD.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If one of these oddballs happens to share your class, any easy to get 
upgrade advice would definitely be appreciated.  Feel free to tear into 
their gear, they won't cry...I think.  Well, they might, but after their 
makeovers, they'll thank you.  I thank you in advance.
