Deference complaining about getting tells for buffs versus complaining
about high levels not giving buffs is that the people below are pretty much
demanding it is their right as lowbies to get high level buffs.  To say
high levels are arrogant or elitist is not a reasonable gripe about why we
turn people down.  Being a high level druid myself, I have had my share of
arrogant putzes who think it is their right to /rude me and insult me
because I refused to buff them or give them anything.  When I was a
beginning druid, with NOTHING to my name, I took advantage of offers,
worked areas I knew I could work, and profitted from doing hard work.  Any
special items I got, usually was due to payment from providing a service,
ranging from porting to SoWing for donations, but rarely have I bugged a
person or hunted them down for buffs, let alone bother them with direct
tells.  I have asked lowbies to run as a bank runner for me while in
Everfrost now, being fairly generous in the exchange and selling of items
because I want to keep my camp and conserve mana.  I even give a little
buffing to them because they are providing me a service I have asked for in
general and not demanded.  In return, they haven't demanded and consider me
a nice person when I call out.

So this BS you are going on about whineplay isn't exactly equal, it is more
of, "Get a clue."

From what I have seen, Enchanters do pretty much like Druids, they Anon
when busy or not feeling up to breezing/Clarity people.  Other times, I
have seen them go around literally announcing they are Clarity/Breezing for
other buffs, and rarely have they been called for other buffs because the
majorly prefered buff is Clarity from Enchanters.  Other 'buff' spells from
Enchanters, are usually ones that are best suited for groups and not very
long lasting.  Druid buffs, at high levels, are long lasting, componentless
(Remember, RUNE spells require components, and most Enchanters don't throw
that on for a reason), and have far more versatility than some of the
spells an Enchanter could throw onto a player.  That 30 Minute Wolf Form
does wonders for a group than the 20 or so minute Garou Form for individual
people.  The 10 to 12 minute DS shield does wonders more than the 30 minute
damage absorber that only absorb so much damage total.  The AC/HP Buff,
like Skin of Diamond or Skin of Nature (With Regen) gives extra hitpoints
along WITH AC, not just AC.

Most enchanters I have run across have pretty much consider themselves
Bubble/crack head dealers, as well as utility casters, the ones who help
augment a group, not major buffers.

And I think this is the point being made.  They are a convience for the
players who don't have that ability.  Just because you have the ability
does not automatically make it your job to buff or cast a spell on someone
because they say so.  And I sure as heck don't expect to run my warrior up
to some Druid or enchanter and demand them to buff me and heal me.  The
only time I do call out for something with my non-druid/non-enchanter, is
for help when I am fighting a mob, but don't expect them to heal me or take
the mob just cause I yell out.  Everything in the game is not by
obligation, it is the will of the person behind the character.
