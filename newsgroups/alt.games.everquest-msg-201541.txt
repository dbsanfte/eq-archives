I really believe that the charm nerf on enchanters also affected the
charm on bards.  When I charm kite, most of the time the mobs attack
my pet but on occasion a mob will break away from the pack and attack
me.  I'm surprised just about all the other giants attacked you
instead.  A *great* zone at level 41 for swarm kiting is the Gulf of
Gunthak.  If you pick your spots, you can get great xp!  I swarm kited
in that zone from levels 41-44.  At level 44, most of the mobs turned
light blue.  At level 47 I've been soloing in City of Mist using charm
to get a group of 3-4 mobs.  None have broken away from the pack to
attack me.  It's so much harder to do when you can't run around in a
zone but the xp has been great at City of Mist.
