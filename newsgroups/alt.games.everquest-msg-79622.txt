Hiya,
I want to give Everquest a try - problem is I'm not sure what I should
get. I've seen the Shadows of Luclin in the shops but that is an
expansion pack. What is the title of the main game? Is it just called
Everquest?
Also, what would you recommend as a minimum spec PC? I have a P3 550
with 256MB RAM and a 32MB geforce graphics card. Is this good enough? It
seemed to run Ultima Online alright.

Thanks in advance.
