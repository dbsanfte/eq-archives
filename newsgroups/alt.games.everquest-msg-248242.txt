Yes.. but software companies know you can't develop in a fucking
vacuum... taking however long you want to 'get it done' and
subsequently fucking over your business timelines. If Worlds of
Warcraft is delayed past the holidays they'll either up releasing in a
downtime or having to hold it back even longer until they hit another
marketing tide. At some point you HAVE to make your game go live.. and
there will be bugs in the release.. i don't care how good you are.
They can either shit or get off the pot..but delaying an MMORPG ad
infinatum, especially while not giving finite dates so that the ad
campeign can work in concert with the release, is highly
counter-productive.

There is no reason we should not have the date for when WoW *OR* EQ2
is going live if we can do the same things for motion pictures that
cost $100+ million dollars. And if it does get delayed be able to tell
how long, why the overrun on time, and the new release date. The
mmorpg industry needs to grow up when it comes to this.

The biggest marketing tool you have is your game.. period. And the
players that want to play your game aren't going to give a shit about
4000 reviews.. they WILL try you out and see what you are looking to
offer. And, for all the vocality of the userbase, mmorpg hardcorers
are usually extremely patient while you iron things out.. especially
if they think you have a winner. Also realize the second best
marketing tool you have is WORD OF MOUTH. I didn't even HEAR about
Everquest until 3 years after it was released, partly because of work,
and when i did it came from friends of friends etc. Not some slick
campeign.. just someone telling me about it.

Right now.. WoW has a unique opportunity... they have a door open to
them. One of the quirks of mmorpg's is that once a user identifies a
game they like and want to work characters up in.. they tend to stay
loyal.. refusing to double up on subscription and game costs between
different games. At the moment... a good deal of the current mmorpg
players have gotten frisky for something new. This happens rarely..
but when it does a mmorpg has a chance to launch... and bring a good
deal of current users along with pulling in new users. In order to do
that.. WoW *HAS* to hit the holiday mark and be released in roughly
the same time frame as EQ2.. give or take a couple months. They get
evaluated along with EQ2.. and they will pull users who decide WoW is
the way to go. Longer than that and anybody allready immersed in EQ2
isn't going to give a shit about WoW, regardless of how good it is.

>to launch first.

It doesn't have to launch 'first'.. it simply has to be in the same
time frame. EQ2 could come out.. then WoW a month or two later.
They'll get evaluated together which is all WoW needs if its got the
goods.
