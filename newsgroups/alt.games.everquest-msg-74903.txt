If the wurms weren't on a 2 min timer, that zone would be a total
joke.  The challenge in that zone is two fold:

1.  Getting a clean pull.
2.  Keeping everyone awake while #1 is being done.

I just wish when you kill all the dragons, everything in the zone
would just depop so you can walk out instead of having to dodge wurms
to the zone out pad.
