You know when his remains are up when you seen Venril Sathir Remains on track
from the zone line area. He will appear on track. Venril Sathir Remains is a
24 hour spawn with a +/- 2 hour window. That is to say he can spawn at 22
hours to 26 hour from the time he as last killed/despawn. He roams from Venril
Sathir's (leg dropping version) room to the buff room just before VS room. He
is a big iksar skeleton. If you know when approximately he is going to spawn,
you can have 1 group in the buff room claiming the area and another on the
battlements outside getting XP. In general, 2 groups with a cleric and a
warrior are sufficient to do this part of the quest.
