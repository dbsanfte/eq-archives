I have to admit, sometimes I have no idea what you guys are saying.  For
instance:

"I snare-dot-nuke kited  yellow cons for their drops for my armor all the
way to level 12."

First of all, I have no idea what "snare-dot-nuke kited" means, though I
understand it's a combat technique.  Yellow cons is in the manual, so that's
easy enough.  I thought drops was the monsters dropping, which you can
actually see happen in the game, but this looks like what treasure the dead
monster gives up.  The rest is easy.  This is actually an easy example.

Now, if I had to guess, from my perspective as a wizard, snare would be root
(but might be something else for a type that doesn't have root), dot is a
silly internet reference for and, and nuke is simple enough (hit it with
whatever leaves the biggest hole).  Kite is something I flew as a kid, so
I'm still trying to figure that one out.  If kited is kill then the
sentence, in something resembling English and actual game terms would be

"I use root and shock of lightning to kill yellow con monsters for their
armor until I reach level 12."

Now, if that is correct, then I'm on the right track, but try figuring that
out on the fly in the game.  Might as well be in Dwarvish.
