You'll be waiting a long time, because I've never done that.

On the other hand, there are at least half a dozen examples of
Bizbee doing that to *me*.  Even this current post of his
is a case in point.

Here are a few classic "bizbee stalking me" posts (and
note that all of these were posted by Bizbee after he
had already killfiled me -- or claimed to have -- so
he was really going out of his way to snipe at me and
keep his grudge alive):

[Context:  I wasn't even participating in that thread, yet 
Bizbee decided to fire a potshot at me out of the absolute blue]

[Context:  Same as above -- out of the blue, just so he
had a cheap excuse to snipe at me.]

[Context:  Someone posted a message that said "hgj" with
a subject line of "jhg".  I joked that it looked like his
keyboard was choking and needed the Heimlich maneuver.
The clueless Bizbee took this as some sort of attack,
and used it as a thin excuse to take a cheap shot at me.]

[Context: Someone asked if a rumor was true (that Everquest
was going to stop charging a monthly fee).  Alex answered
with a straight face that it was indeed true.  I didn't
want anyone mistaking his sarcasm for a serious affirmative
answer, so I posted and plainly stated that Alex's answer
was sarcasm.  Alex posted as above, about me spoiling his
fun.  Bizbee then pops in out of the blue and for
no discernable reason feels compelled to tell Alex
that I'm an "idiot".]

Context:  I had commented on what exactly had and had not
been changed by the 01/2002 "horse nerf".  I was absolutely
correct in my comments.  And yet for some reason, Bizbee felt
compelled to issue the above bizarre broadside.

######

Here's an incoherent rant by Bizbee aimed at me which
is so classic you've just got to read the whole thing,
including my lengthy analysis:

 http://makeashorterlink.com/?F65C5669

######

And so on.

Project much, Bizbee?

If anyone's wondering why Bizbee has such a hard-on about me,
it's because he once challenged me to support something
I said about him (in a thread where someone else had
first raised the issue of Bizbee's flaming) -- and since
he asked me to, I did:
   http://makeashorterlink.com/?K58C1269

He promptly killfiled me.

He's been outraged and holding a grudge about my documentation
of his behavior ever since, even though I've been pointedly
ignoring him, even when he's been firing off childish personal
attacks like the above.

Bizbee keeps claiming that X number of people like to "stalk"
him, but it's clearly he who can't leave well enough alone.
He seems to be *trying* to provoke flamewars, and can't
stand being ignored.

Bizbee is one of those people who can proudly dish out heaping
platefuls of flames and personal attacks, and yet can't
take it when people even do so much as offer some
justifiable criticism or corrections in return (ironically,
even including such criticisms as, "hey Bizbee, you flame
a lot.")

It's one of the most childish things I've seen in two decades
of online discussions.

Bizbee, you're only making yourself look foolish when you
stalk me like this.
