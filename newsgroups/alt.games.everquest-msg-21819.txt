Dang.. lol... let me get some sleep first! :-)  I think I finally went to
bed at 5 a.m. <yawn>

I had a great time!  I was pretty scared going in because I had no idea what
to expect. We're all hanging around in SRO, getting instructions and
warnings.. "If you get aggroed, go to the floor and die. Do not train the
camp. Get your /loc and consent a rogue."  I have a really bad sense of
direction, so I was worried I'd get lost on the way to the camp, and die a
horrible death. lol  I printed out a map, so it wasn't THAT bad. Then there
was "Don't go to far up on the wall, because you'll aggro second floor mobs.
If you do aggro them, camp immediately."

People were all assembled prior to 8 pm, and I think we started porting up
pretty much on time. We had a big crowd of people - way more than we needed,
but my guild leader has planned the raid as a "Friday the 13th" party of
sorts. Also, it was the last Hate raid he was going to organize. Anyhow,
despite all the dire warnings, I made it to the camp okay. I camped and went
to chat as instructed, and had a lot of fun talking to the people. We got
the call to go back in, and we did. The few that died getting to the camp
were rezzed and we were ready to start fighting.

A level 60 monk was doing the pulling, with a 57 warrior peeling. The first
few mobs went fine, but then somehow we aggroed a whole bunch at once (maybe
six? or eight?). I think we were fighting too close to the town. Everything
was red to me, and people started dropping pretty quickly. The cleric in our
group went down early on. Nothing like fighting knowing you are going to
die!  I helped kill a few, and then died myself. Kept 46 by a hair.. yay! I
imagine the epic clerics camped as soon as things looked bad, and everyone
else died. Got a rez, and we were back fighting pretty quickly. After that
things went pretty smoothly. We spent quite a few hours clearing the first
floor. We did kill "a very unpleasant hand," which was kind of funny. Lost a
few rogues doing that because of the /repost spell or whatever it has. Our
group actually got experience on quite a few of the mobs, so I got ahead of
where I was before I died.

We went upstairs and did some of the mobs up there, but it started getting
late. The Maestro popped on the first floor, so we went back down to kill
him as the last fight for the night. Some of the healers got too close to
the walls prior to the fight, and got HTed. We all had to camp to clear
aggro. More rezzes. The Maestro wasn't really that hard.. although it was
"interesting" being lifetapped for 380dmg multiple times (and living! lol)
He dropped a couple bard items. Clerics made out like bandits, with tons of
armor. A few other pieces dropped, but no monk stuff (and I didn't expect
any, although apparently Maestro does drop monk pieces sometimes).

The rare gems were handed out, and people began porting out.. you'd think
this would be the end of the story.. but...
