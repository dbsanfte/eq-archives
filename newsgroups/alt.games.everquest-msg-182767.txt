I back up my EQ directory to tape every couple of months. Ironically,
after several years, I still have all but the original Kunark CD, and I
never had that one. It was stolen from my desk at work, where I had it
delivered. They returned it, minus CD later that day. I logged in to EQ
from work (Bad me..) and used the key to activate right then and there.
Got a buddy to copy his Kunark CD so I could install at home.... The
thief got a CD they couldn't use.
