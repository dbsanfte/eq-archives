I play a 65 bst myself and its not usually a issue. But I will position my
pet to be not push things up the wall. The pet hold works if you cant get
your pet in the right place also. Even before I got the pet hold aa I would 
just tell him to back off of kill it. Its great at stopping gating mobs that
cant be stunned on raids and such also. All in all just make sure your bst
is paying attention and knows how to control his/her pet.
