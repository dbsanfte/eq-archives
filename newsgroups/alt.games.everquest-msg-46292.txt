Inciting panic is a crime, Falsa.  Of course, there is more potential for
damage but this is a games NG and little here care about your awkward
warnings.  I noticed that you posted earlier that events like this have
never happened.  I suggest you study US history.  The Whitehouse was burned
in 1812 and in the Civil War acts of terrorism were commonplace especially
in bloody Kansas.  Everyone knows that more may come but nothing is worse
than a Chicken Little like you who rants about the dangers but has no plan
on what to do.  Since most of your friends are doctors I suggest you invest
in some anti-paranoid anti-psychotic meds like Zyprexa, Haldol or Risperdal.
When it's your time to die no amount of whining will save your ass.
