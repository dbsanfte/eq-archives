I only get the interrupt message on slopes.

Not sure if these are related, but here's the casting bug I am dealing 
with...

Many months ago, I used to get the a message along the lines of "spell 
recovery time not met" when chain-casting spells.  I'd have to pause a 
little before casting the next spell, even though the gem said it was 
ready.  Then, it went away.

EQ-AL ( Everquest After Luclin ) has those messages coming back again, so I 
have to pause for a bit after the gem for my next spell cycles up.

The Gem shouldn't come back to active status if it's not ready to be cast.
