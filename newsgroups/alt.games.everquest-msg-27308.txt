No, I mean that in that group in that location, that ranger pulling
meant I had more mana available than when that warrior pulled.   I
didn't suddenly go from being a "good cleric" to being a "bad cleric,"
neither did I suddenly start "doing something wrong" as the post I
responded to suggested the original poster was doing by being OOM
after every third pull.   For that group, against those mobs, the
ranger was the right person to be pulling.   After letting the warrior
pull for a while, the ranger took back over, and my mana stopped
being the chokepoint in the effort for the group to get constant XP.

A cleric may simply be unable to maintain "proper" mana levels, even
when he's doing everything right, due to no fault of his own.   Stating
that a cleric who's OOM after every third pull "must be doing something
wrong" ignores the dynamics of the game.
