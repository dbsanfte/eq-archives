Yes, and can be very useful for fun role-play when not in potential danger -

I was the high level PLing some guild alts in HHK and had just met the
cutest little flirt hobbit girl... Much hilarity as we ran our conversations
on the guild channel, was getting lots of good suggest tells from guys in
the guild...

Anyway, she was very pointedly telling me, on guild channel, about which of
the OTHER guys in the party she was 'inspecting', comments on their weapons,
etc...

So I went over and rooted her!

Glad I logged the session, gonna post it on characters website...
