Depending on level, runes also cost gems to cast - and blowing a peridot
(12pp or so) on every pull gets expensive fast.  It's seldom that a sigle
rune will get you through a single fight against non-green, either.  Also
depending on level, a rune can cost most of a bubble of mana to cast; it
will eat your manabar fast.

Chain-stunning - casting PBAOE stuns in sequence to keep mobs from
fighting - is a better option.  PBAOE stuns are cheap and fast casting.  An
average level 52 enchanter can chain three stuns, keeping the local mobs
perma-locked, for two to three minutes.  A level 62 enchanter, such as mine,
can maintain for almost five minutes nonstop.  This technique is also called
a 'stunfield' or 'stunweb.'

The most common use of a stunweb is to support a PBAOE group, with wizards,
mages, and druids kicking off damage spells as the mobs stand helpless.
However, if you have a higher-level enchanter and some lower-level melees
who can't take the hits, a stunweb can allow them to swing to their heart's
content against an immobile foe.  I've duo'd with both rangers and rogues by
pulling with a slow, then when the mob comes in starting the stunweb while
the melee types kicked out damage from behind - the mob never got a chance
to turn around.  (In fact, this is how I went from 58 to 59, in Chardok.)
