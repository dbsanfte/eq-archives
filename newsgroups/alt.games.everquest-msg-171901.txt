The Sabertooths will agro (and chain) now, so it's not quite as easy
as it used to be.  Their agro radius is small tho, so it's not too
difficult to manage.  At 18 I would probably work the mill area (SE
corner of the zone, iirc), there's a fair stretch of the zone wall
near the mill on the way back to FV zone that no wanderers path to
which is great to pull to, and you can see a fairly large open area
to pull from there while resting/medding (and can dump weighty loot
on the dwarf vendor inside the mill).  Biggest risk doing LOIO is
not being careful enough running from FV PoK boot to LOIO zone, some
of the Drachnids are high enough to cast See Invis on themselves, so
con every spider before risking running close to it.

Also good at 18 is the lowbie yard in OT, the area right out from the
PoK book.  Stay away from the entrance to the outpost (for some reason
those "evil" NPCs just don't seem to like tree huggers) and with Snare
you'll easily be able to escape (via the book) if you get in trouble
(as a courtesy to others who might be coming thru there you should try
not to train the book, fight a ways out and Snare everything, if you
get in over your head you'll make the book with the pursuing mobs well
behind you).  This area is open, with a sparse-to-moderate wanderer
population and none of the mobs has a large agro/chain radius, so it's
a great place for kiting to work up archery skill too.
