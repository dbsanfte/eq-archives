    Tyger, go make a new troll. Now go get your newbie tunic. Oops, no
guildmasters. No guildmasters = no initial faction adjustment. No way to
train up skills for your first foray out. No way to train skills like Taunt,
PERIOD. That's hardly a small inconvenience.

    I appreciate that they're trying to introduce change into the world,
which everyone seemed to want. I even hear that there might be a new troll
home city, although I'm very skeptical of that because it contradicts the
"zones for levels 35 to 60" thing. But did they have to dick over an
existing playable race to do these things?

    James
