Sorry for quoting the whole message, but I just liked it so much. I am not
sure where this all started, and don't really care. I am not sure what
either of these guys' reps are in the ng, and don't really care.

But I would like to say to Mark that I wish more people around here would
respond like you. I applaud your civil, even respectful, response to
somebody who openly attacked you and dared you to flame him back. Regardelss
of what happened before, and what may transpire, you are the winner here.
Not that there needs to be a "winner", but you certainly are as far as
character goes.

It is nice to know that if I ever find the need to disagree with you here, I
can look forward to a civilized discussion.

Carry on.

Lefty
