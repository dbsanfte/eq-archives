The number one bug is going to be:

a 24 hour patch process making bloody damm sure that everything is working
perfectly as to be one step ahead of all those buggers in this newsgroup.
Then the grand moment, the whole building turns up for the great switching
on the servers party. The switch is flicked....the switch is flicked
again.......the switch is flicked an inordidant amount of times at a
velocity aproaching the speed of light....nothing happens. Except for a
small lighted button blinking in the darkness, engineers quickly press this
button after which that light too goes out.
Every programmer and engineer frantically spends the next 24 hours trying
with despiration bordering on insanity to get at least something going.
At five past eleven the next morning, a cleaning lady removes a floppy disk
from the master servers floppy drive after which the whole system comes
online, leaving at least 2 Verant employees dead and 7 criticaly injured.
