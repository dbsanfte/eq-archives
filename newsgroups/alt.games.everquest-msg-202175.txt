I havent played my monk much recently (having too much fun with my 38
Beastlord), but I want to get back into the grind.... got about 40%
left till ding to 55.
I have heard that Kedge Keep is a great zone for solo exp at my level,
but I know next to nothing about the zone (been there once for an epic
fight and was CotHed to the fight and Xloced out.
	What in particular is good to fight, and on the flip side,
what should I stay away from.  Any guides or links covering this
subject would be great.

My gear is not uber, but it doesnt suck by any means either:

And if you dont have any info on the Kedge Keep, any other prime
location recommendations?  I would like them to be Solo suggestions,
for often I have limited time so dont like to form up a group just to
bail out on them at a bad time.
	I had been hunting in Dulak over on the boardwalk near the
Shark Bar.  Single pulls are easy, but exp is rather limited (still
dark blue but takes a while to work em down, and with the fast regen
they have when you FD... that really sucks)

As usual, I appreciate your time and Insight.
