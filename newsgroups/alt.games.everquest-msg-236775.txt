What do you tell someone who beleives their prayers have been
answered? Do tell them it was just coincidence and that they are
deluding themselves? If it was your prayer that was answered... would
you tell yourself the same thing?

Me, I'd go with the E theory first :) I find it even harder to beleive
in a God that would show up with pointy stick to prove it than I do in
a God that wouldn't.  :)

And yeah... religions are a whole separate fiasco :) And if God showed
up to poke them with a stick I bet they wouldn't beleive it was him
either.

Basically there is ample evidence to justify faith if you are looking
to beleive. If you're looking "not to beleive" than nothing will make
you.

You've already looked at the splendor of the universe and said... That
doesn't really impress me much... dammit God I need something big...
this universe isn't doing it for me... but maybe if you sent me  a
talking fish? 

And all I'm saying is that if existance and the universe didn't do
it... I'd be skeptical that you would believe for a talking fish.
