In addition

Terris Thule encounter is broken... the bufferflies path via ZONE IN, and
the AoE debuff doesnt go off. Friends guild killed it with 16!! people by
kiting Gargs at the end.

Some rare spawn mobs with placeholders were spawing EVERY time

Akeva was despawned by GM's when it was discovered lots of mobs (including
IV, Shei, Va'Dyn) were hiting beastlords for 1!!! damage.

Also texture cache files seem to be rebuilding each time you go into a zone
and then rezone
