That was my point, perhaps I should have made it more clear that I was 
being sarcastic. I'm the highest character in a small, non-raiding guild, 
and to top it off, I play on GMT while most of them are PST, so 
basically, when it comes to equipment, if I can't solo it or buy it, I 
ain't getting it.

The guy who told me to get my Epic seemed to assume that I could somehow 
pull Epic weapons out of my rectum in one smooth move. If this were the 
case, a.g.e would hear of it, rest assured.
