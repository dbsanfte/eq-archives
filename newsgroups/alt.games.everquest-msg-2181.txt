If you miss killing the PH the moment it spawns, don't despair --
it (or even Gynok himself) will wander from the spawn point, down
to the second floor, then RUN back up to the spawn point, then
turn around and walk down to the third floor, then RUN all the
way back up to the spawn point again, then finally walk all the
way down to the third floor one more time and park by the "chair"
until it despawns.

The exception is the Giant Rat PH, which for some reason
keeps getting stuck on the first locked door (even if you
open the door for it!).  It'll shuffle against the door
for about 15 seconds, then teleport back to the spawn point
and hike back to the locked door again, get stuck again,
repeat repeat.

Yes that's weird, but that's what they do.  Follow one around
sometime, it's amusing.

So even if you just sit by the entrance, you'll have 3 chances to
kill the PH (or more for the Giant Rat).

Note:  Everything in Befallen is a stationary spawn, they just
stand there looking stupid (unless something aggros them).  ANYTHING
you see roaming Befallen is Gynok's placeholder, going for a stroll
along the path I described above.

Letting the PH live does delay the respawn a bit, but not by much.
The PH will despawn by itself after about 14 minutes, then the next
PH will arrive as usual only a few minutes behind the usual
15 minute cycle.

Finally, some people believe that if you let the PH's live,
it hastens Gynok's arrival.  I personally have had better luck
letting them live than killing them every time they pop, although
that may have just been coincidence.  But I've spoken to other
people who have noted the same thing.  Plus, there's obviously
something specially coded about the Gynok PH's -- instead of
just spawning a Greater Skeleton or whatever and letting it
loose if Gynok's number didn't come up, the PH's also (if
you give them enough time to live to get around to it) shout
Gynok's famous, "Graaaaaaagh, you have disturbed my slumber,
suffer as I have!" line, almost as if they're another incarnation
of poor Gynok.  They're clearly being handled by some
sort of "special processing" routine in the server program,
so it's not too unreasonable to think that what happens to them
might be linked to Gynok's spawning.
