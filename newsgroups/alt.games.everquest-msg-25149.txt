Dump whatever drivers came with it. Install generic standard VGA
drivers for the OS. Now re-install Direct-X (7a reccomended by Verant,
8 works fine for me) once that is done, load the NVIDIA Detonator
reference drivers from www.nvidia.com .  Play the game, no stutters.

If stutters continue, follow above procedure, but include removing and
reinstalling your SB live drivers alongside the GeForce drivers.
