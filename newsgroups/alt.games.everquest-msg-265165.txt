Wish I could give you an answer but I honestly don't know what the various 
weapons restrictions are. My recommendation for getting as much as an answer 
as you're gonna get is to post this same question in the official EQ2 public 
forums. Many of the beta players read that forum, and even those who haven't 
played are in some cases tracking tons of data.

I'd give you a link right to the forums themselves but the cookies on my 
machine will try and take you to the beta forums and you'll get stopped 
there. Go to the above link and choose Forums on the righthand side. Lots of 
noise to wade through, but tons of information.
