Wow, you must swim fast to keep up with the boat.  But you are right it
zones before the zone border.  I fell off once just before it zoned and it
was a swim before I reached "the edge of the world".  Takes awhile to figure
out you aren't going anywhere though.  Nice to know someone else has been
out there.  Its not very deep.
