Now you're wandering from your original claims. Not saying your gender
and acting gender neutral was, originally in your posts, "misleading
people" unless you pre-empted any misunderstanding by stating your
real life gender first, and that of course is wrong.

Are you waffling, or is this a full backtrack?
