Thanks for the Tip Eleena. But I guess I'm still a little confused. The
original subject where this came up was advice on taking down the
Scalekeeper and Master Yael in the Hole. I'm not home to check, but I
think that Rune V, when cast on me by the 54 Chanter I noramlly group
with, only gives me a skin of something like 500 pts IIRC. The fact that
the mob wont' proc on me until that 500 pts is gone is certainly a nice
plus, but as MA or SA, when I'm tanking a larger mob like that, I take
500 pts. in probably the first three to five successful hits that the
mob lands. That doesn't take long. And Rune is a BIG aggro magnet when
cast during combat. 

Any practical tips on how this is used on an old world boss mob raid
scenario to defeat the mob's proccing efforts without getting my chanter
waxed?
