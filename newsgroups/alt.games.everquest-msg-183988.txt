You mean when everyone was crowded into Lower Guk, SolB, High Hold
Pass/Keep, South Karana, and EC, North Freeport or Greater Fey
trading/selling?

Hear that? That is a clue trying to find you.

EQ is MUCH bigger than it was 2-3 years ago. Zones added with the
expansions are the main reason why you see less crowding.

300+ in the Bazaar on most servers is 2-3 times the numbers I used to
see in EC before the bazaar. Sure most of the accounts logged into the
bazaar are 2-boxers, but that doesn't change the fact that those are
still paying accounts.

Paludal Caverns is just as crowded (and annoying) as South Karana or
Lake of Ill Omen used to be, and there are still decent numbers of
players in the latter two zones.

I have run into 2 complete EQ newbies in the last week, and that was
on one of the least populated servers. 

The only theory you have backed up is that you are clueless, and have
nothing of value to say in this group.
