- Buy a new keyboard please...this one has to be as annoying to you as it is

Though in the tunnel the frame rate was pretty danged bad, away from it you
couldn't even tell there was an event going on if it weren't for the
inevitable high level idiots spamming the zone with requests to help kill
the GMs that weren't supposed to be killed.
