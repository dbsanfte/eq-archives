Most baked food weighs 0.1, with a few exceptions (centi steaks come to
mind).  My suggestion for both raising skill and for general eating is fish
rolls.  One fresh fish and one bat wing, combine in an oven or a spit.  Bat
wings are sold by merchants in the Bazaar and in EC, or you can buy them
from newbies if you like.  Fresh fish are sold by many vendors in many
zones, or you can just fish for them.  Both components are cheap, but it
takes a lot of clicking to get to a skill where you can make them reliably.
You might want to raise your skill a bit first with things like various
sandwiches and candied spider.  You can vendor-dive for spider legs and
different meats.
