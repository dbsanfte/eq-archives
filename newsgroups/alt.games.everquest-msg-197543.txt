Um, amazingly efficient cold nukes?  Aren't they the same ones a shaman 
gets, but the shaman gets them much earlier?  I have certainly never heard 
my nukes called amazingly efficient.  As far as slowing, it's better than 
none, but not even close to a shaman or enchanter for effectiveness.

What a high level Bst does add to a group is good DPS and a stacking mana 
regen, as well as the ability to be a slower in a pinch.
