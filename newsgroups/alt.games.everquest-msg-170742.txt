::nod:: I was in a group last night where I *know* the two lootwhores 
both had higher level chars.  In about 2 hours of play, I managed to 
loot two corpses out of pure luck.  As SOON as the body dropped, the 
healer would appear in the middle of us, bent over.  I'm sure he was 
standing behind us right clicking like mad.  It wasn't the loot that 
annoyed me, mind you - rawhide and rusty weapons, ooh - it was the fact 
that they were so completely rude about it.  It's the first time since 
I've started this char that I pickpocketed without telling anyone.  
Fortunately, my skill is high enough to almost make a decent share of 
the profits that way ;p  Meanwhile, the healer would grab aggro 
constantly and then run around, dragging the mob through the bad 
pathing.  When I asked him to stop so we could actually *hit* the thing 
and get it off him, he said he ran around until he managed to get off a 
snare or a root again.  Problem was, that'd take at least 3 rounds of 
the room, and meanwhile he was backing up and hitting it every so often 
and casting on it like mad while we weren't getting ANY hits on it.  
After awhile, I just said "fuckit" and stopped and waited while he 
struggled to get root off on the thing.

OTOH I do love roaming groups who *know what they're doing*, and who 
deal with lootwhores if they happen to appear.  The exp is fantastic 
when you're just mowing them down as you go, and it's a real high when 
you get a dozen at once and manage to pull through.  And if you do die 
in such a case, who cares?  You're in a good group, and at that level, 
you'll make the exp up in 30 seconds of killing!  It's not the moving 
around that makes it a bad thing, it's the idiocy of some members ;p
