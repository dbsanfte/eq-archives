This option does exist, and I've seen it used.

Back before the opening of the hole, a GM event in N Qeynos
between a couple of the big names was disrupted by a then
guildmate of mine.  He was plopped into a space he described
as a virtual jail cell, no doors or features to speak of.  Whereever
he was, he could not reach anyone with /ooc or /shout, only
/tells and /guild channels seemed to reach anyone.

He was a tank of some kind, so I have no idea whether he
could gate out
