Caveat: I've only played EQ (and LOTRO), but my wife and other RL friends
play WoW so I've heard a lot of descriptions.  Still, my impressions are
only second-hand.

I think it's something of a misperception.  Certainly some things are
easier in WoW than in EQ, and that's not necessarily bad.  E.g., the
way they track your active quests and what step you're working on, EQ
eventually did something similar with the Task window, but it's still
pretty weak, and the limit of 15 Tasks is absurdly small.  And I gather
that WoW generally does not use EQ's approach of forcing players to
camp place-holders for anywhere from 10 minutes to 100 hours to get a
rare named mob to spawn.  (WoW does still have mindless grinding, esp.
for reputation (faction).)  I've heard descriptions of some high-end
raids in WoW, and they're at least as complicated as the stuff I've
seen and heard about in EQ.

I think WoW's reputation stems in part from the easier questing system
and such attracting a wider variety of players, so it has collected a
larger share of jerks and idiots, who tend to stand out and about whom
many horror stories are told.  But it certainly also has lots of skilled,
intelligent players.  If I had time to play two games I'd undoubtedly
give it a try, but as it is I don't even have all the time I'd like for
EQ, and have no urge to start over.
