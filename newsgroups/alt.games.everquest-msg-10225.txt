Wow, I have to thank you for the advice!  I returned to BB and yes, the
corpse was there!  I managed to run quickly by all the guards in BB and get
into Kaladim standing right by the zone border while a Dwarf dragged the
corpse to me.  I managed to get to FP by simple walking without incident,
moving quickly between the guards at the docks.  I do con threatening to
them.

I started a Wood Elf Warrior on Zeb while I was still in limbo and had given
up hope on my character, but I guess now I can return to the comfort of
playing the Human once more.  I have full banded and some other stuff on Zeb
from my Level 10 Cleric test character... I think I might use it to play a
Wood Elf Ranger on Zeb just so I can have a character on two servers in case
anything happens.

The 17 dmg sword is a Bone Blade Claymore... or something like that.  Any
good?
