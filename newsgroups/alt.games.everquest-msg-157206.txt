Most Cleric damage comes from several sources... Unswerving Hammer of Faith,
Mark of Retribution, and the Hammer of Judgement proc.

Depending on your weapon, I guess there is a possibility a Cleric could out
damage a Paladin in melee... however, if I recall correctly, very high end
Clerics average around 30 DPS with the UHOF, MoR, and the Hammer of
Judgement.

If you can't top 30 DPS, I'm forced to believe you're in main-tank mode and
using a shield.

I have a Paladin friend with Narandi's Lance who usually hits in the
neighborhood of 200 per swing. Now either she's an rarity, or other people
are exaggerating the usefulness of Cleric melee.

In the end, what difference does it really make? Paladins and Shadow Knights
aren't exactly damage machines - we're tanks. We lose damage in favour of
plate mitigation (it didn't make a difference until recently, but hey... it
does now). Something tells me Cleric melee harmed your ego more than your
grouping ability. <cough>

First things first, if I recall correctly, Rangers are on a higher innate
damage chart than Warriors so Rangers deal more damage in straight melee
than Warriors... the spells are just the deathblow in the comparison.
Rangers trade tanking ability for damage and utility.

If a Necro stacked a ton of DOTs on one mob and kept it Feared with it's pet
smacking it around, not only would the Necro make the mob his bitch, but he
would also out-damage a Shadow Knight.

The balance here is the amount of effort and time it takes.

Heh, thanks. Now I don't need to feign courtesy anymore.

A guy has to be good at something, I guess. My Furor statistic was shown in
the light of your statistic. In other words, I tried the same shit you did.

As for the quotes at the end of my posts... that's really more of a random
choice. Sometimes I pick quotes that have something to do with the topic,
other times I pick quotes that just seem right at the time.

Care to guess my reasoning with the quote for this post?
