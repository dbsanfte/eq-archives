OK, WTF are yout talking about?
"you mop up all the otherwise wasted mana"

What *exactly* does this mean?

If you are talking about the xp for the kill, then no, the xp for a
higher-level kill is factored out to keep you from DING-ing like 5 times
from 1 uber-deep-red con to you.

As far as the L60 killing a bunch of greens, then that maybe true, but
tradeskillers also kill mobs for pelts, and other components for their
recipes, or perhaps for a quest or 2.
