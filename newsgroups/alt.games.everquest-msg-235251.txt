why would you petition any of those names? Garrfield isnt an offensive name,
and I dont recall seeing anywhere in the eula that you cant pick a name
based on something from life or tv.

Were you in a bad mood and trying to start problems for people or something?
why would you do that.
If it was my name and was as harmless as garrfield as someone changed it
they had better give me a good reason for it, and even then I would dispute
it with a gm, and if I didnt get it back that would probably be a deal
breaker for me on any future products involving soe.
