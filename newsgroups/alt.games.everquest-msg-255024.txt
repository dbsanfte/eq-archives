I've also been in LDoNs where at the end of the adventure someone inevitably
wants to 'try that chest we saw in that other room'.  

Generally the very next thing I do is evac to the entrance or run my butt off
to get out before they trip the thing.

On the occasions that I have made it *almost* to the exit and the chest in
question was pretty deep in, I haven't been affected by the trap.  

Generally though, I like to play it safe and just bail to the outside and let
the curious folks kill themselves...  LOL

The other day however, I was on an LDoN (finally able to do lvl 65 adventures! 
Yay me!  LOL) and someone did an AE and hit the damn thing.  The effect was
that the entire party was suddenly drunk.

THAT was hillarious!  Those sorts of traps I can deal with.  :)
