Yep, the letters show horizontal connections.  Velk's Lab is a 
3-dimensional dungeon, and is hard to render well with a 2-D drawing.  So 
for example there so you 2 spots marked with A, they are at the same X,Y 
co-ordinates, but are different levels of the paths.

Not really.  The map at www.eqmaps.com provides much more clarity of the 
black ball room (spot K on this map), but it doesn't even deal with the 
ramps that are the majority of the hunting areas in Velks. 
The thing is that Velks lab is pretty trivial for the majority of the 
hunting you will do there.  The ramps take about 10 minutes to learn, and 
none of the ramp mobs see invis, so it's pretty easy to explore.
Learning how to get to the village (tents) is pretty simple if someone 
shows you once (and you don't learn by dropping into the pit and running 
your way back up).  The pit is even easier to get to, and almost nobody 
ever walks out of the pit (silly bards excepted).  It doesn't take a map 
to say, "Port us to GD druid/wizard".
