IIRC, Verant added VAH and BST to the appropriate equipment long before
Luclan was released.  If they never showed up on the Fungi Tunic's list,
then there was no reason to buy it for that purpose.  That's quite a bit
different than Verant changing things *after* you've gone through great
effort, or laid down your plat to get something.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
