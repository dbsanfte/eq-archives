For the same points?  In other words, if there's a 2 damage augment for 
50 points, is there also a 4 damage augment that can only be applied to 
weapons with a delay over 40 for the same 50 points?

And even so, this only limits the effect a little, if the break point is 
at 40, then a 39 delay weapon compares poorly both with a 20 delay 
weapon of the same ratio -and- one with a 40 delay and same ratio.

Not that this is a unique situation; the damage bonus thing works the 
same way, but depending on how many different "minimum delay of" 
augments there are, I suspect it makes the leaps in how good a weapon 
can be even more chunky.

Excellent, that means that considering a proc augment can happen 
independant of the weapon ratio, and in fact independant of what my 
current weapon and plan for future weapon might be.

Of course the fact that the proc rate is 2 per minute even if I have a 
much higher dex that I currently do also suggests that a 50DD proc isn't 
going to mean as much as a warm bucket of spit; which supports my 
general impression that the only procs worth having are ones with 
effects I want such as my DS proccing practice sword, or something that 
procs a slow, or some such.  100 extra damage per minute?  Pathetic!

I didn't say it was correct, I said it was the obvious conclusion.  I 
suspected there was something wrong with the arguement.

On the flip side, I'd really hesitate to invest heavily in things that 
seem wrong, just hoping that somehow I'm incorrect about that.  Without 
some support for a contrary arguement to at least hope for, I'd probably 
have gone with armor augments instead of blowing points on proc augments 
for slow weapons.

Thats helpful as well, of course on FV you can sell them to other 
players for pp, or for LDoN points (because you can, or at least could, 
buy an augment from a vendor and trade it to someone else who could turn 
it in for the points back)

I have no idea, my current character has a whopping 81 points to his 
name, and those spread out over several camps to make them even more 
worthless.  On FV I could give them all to a friend who'd unlocked 81+ 
points in the camp of my choice and have him get a given item for me 
(thats how I got my mage's pet focus augment), but on ordinary servers, 
5 camps with 20 points in each is a far cry from one camp with 100 points.
