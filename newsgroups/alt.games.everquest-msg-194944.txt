Fading shadow weapons from Tower of Frozen Shadow are non-magic and
have ratios a lot better than the nonmagic fine steel weapons. 
They're not great, but they're not bad.  I used to use the 17 delay
dagger to work piercing up.  I'm not sure that each of them has a
ratio noticeably better than fine steel, so don't point out that the
scimmy's the same or something!
