I mostly agree.  I don't think I've even been to any of the PoR zones.
(And I haven't done much with DoDH yet, either.)  The only thing I've
gotten out of PoR so far, besides the bank space, is the new tradeskill
trophy tasks in the Freeport newbie yard.

I got PoR digitally, so I didn't get the warhorse bonus, but as I
understand it it's not a mount by itself.  Instead, it's something
you add to a bridle to get a warhorse-summoning bridle.  (I don't
know if it works with drog drums.)  If you buy a faster horse later,
you can remove the warhorse part from your old bridle and attach it
to the new one.  The quest for this is sort of cute; one of the wards
at the entrance to the stables in the bazaar does it.

As for the warhorse itself, all I've heard is that it's just graphics,
i.e. your horse looks spiffy.  And the graphics are quite nice, frankly,
but the horse underneath it all is the same as before.
