My BF got a KEI in the Nexus the other day from a gal doing it "for donations".
 Went to pay her and found he was broke.  (I had.. ummm... errr.... *borrowed*
all his plat while he was busy in the real world.)  He was mortified - and a
little pissed at me I might add.  Explained the situation, and sat down to wait
for me to port in (immediately if not sooner) with his money.  I paid the gal
100 plat and told her what happened.  She laughed.  I'm glad some people have a
sense of humor... :)
