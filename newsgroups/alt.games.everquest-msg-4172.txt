There are no objectives. You can become friends with dragons if you kill
their
enemies. You can also learn their language.

Oh how COOL!!! She will love this, I am sure!

A book comes with each CD, I assume. The only problem will be getting her to
read it BEFORE she messes with the game.. hehe. Now... I hate to bother you
with further questions, but what exactly do you mean "ALLOCATE YOUR INITIAL
STATS CORRECTLY" and does starting your character over require unsubscribing
and re-subscribing?

Thanks VERY much for this info. :)
