Wow! Someone else who can quote things that have seemingly no importance, but can 
be funny if used at the right time.

On the old text MUD I used to play on I had the title "Master of Useless Quotes". 
An example would be, during a period of noteable silence on the channels, 
something like "You cannot cast a spell while sitting.", or "You are sleeping."
