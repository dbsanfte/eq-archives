I suspect you're largely waiting for a change in player attitudes... We 
took a normal a while back, and immediately upon entering there was a bad 
pull (which was my fault, oops!) that wiped us, and during that fight, the 
shaman and one other (ranger?) went LD never to return. (Actually, I take 
that back... the ranger blinked back into existence for about 1 minute 
and promptly LDed again 3 times.)  That left me (enchanter), a wizard, 
rogue, and warrior.  We actually got about 1/3 to 1/2 of the adventure 
done within the ballpark of successful completion before another wipe 
occurred that depressed us enough that we gave up. (I think we had 9 drops 
on a 22 collect in 40 minutes.)  Anyway, if this can be done with an 
enchanter as main healer (yay uproar!) and 2 men short... People just need 
to think a bit outside the box.  Really.  I've done normals with no slower 
as well, on other characters.  It's not practical to go without a healer, 
but even a ranger would probably do, and it's not practical to go without 
a slower, although a BST can probably fit the bill, but it -can- be done.
