I have found that if you have the bash ability, and put a point into 
training it, both your slam and bash skills (which are shared) increase. 
I am able to slam for the same damage I can bash. This has proven to be 
very handy when I am using a two handed sword. Unfortunately those large 
races who can slam, but don't have the bash ability, aren't able to 
increase their slam skill.
