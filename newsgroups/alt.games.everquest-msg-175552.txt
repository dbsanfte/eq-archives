It's kind of a "yes but" situation.  Yes, your stuff stays on your corpse
when you die.  But you can pay a certain amount of cash to a cloning station
to insure some or all of your belongings, and when you respawn at the
cloning station you'll get your stuff back.  Or at least the stuff you
insured.  When you're a "baby" character you won't have to worry about
losing your stuff because you won't have much worth having.  When you get
anything you really want to keep, all you need to do is figure the price of
the item is whatever the going price is plus insurance, that way you can
insure the item as well as buying it.
