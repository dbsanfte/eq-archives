It's a level thing, At your level you'll need dedicated healer support
to stay up against that kind of an AoE. It's hard to judge (w/o being
there) whether your healers did the right thing or not by letting you
die. You might have been better off backing out of the fight and
waiting for a heal once you got under half. 

From what you described, with just a very few lvl 60+ people in your
guild, I think it's gonna be difficult to do rage without a lot of
dying. I dunno what your server is like but at least on Bristlebane
clerics don't seem to have much trouble getting a bit of help with
their rage fights. Everyone tries to be nice to clerics that are about
to get their clicker <g>. 

Rgds, Frank
