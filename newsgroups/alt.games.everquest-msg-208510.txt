I was running an errand into Kaladim last night (oh all right, I
was blatantly cashing in CB belts to get some patchwork for my
shaman friend) when someone accosted me in broken gnomish.  He
was a young dwarf (blue to me, thats young!) who complained that
for a week straight there'd been no creatures in the vicinity
near the entrance to Kaladim.  I looked around, and where you'd
expect to see a half dozen skeletons, goblins, krag chicks etc
(even back in the old days, I hear that newbie area spawns were
dramatically increased, and have observed that in several areas)
there was, with some looking around, one little black widow.
Killed that and managed to find some little scarab (I assume the
same spawn table.)  At any rate, I petitioned the situation and
went on my way, glad -I- wasn't interested in any of the drops in
that area for my newbie armor.

As an aside, the exp for the CB belts was pitiful, barely budging
my exp bar at 7th level
