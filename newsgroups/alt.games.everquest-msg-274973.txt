If it shows it has more than one meaning then it illustrates that I 
don't maintain that words can only have one meaning. So why are you 
accusing me of exactly that? (Hint: There is no good answer. You screwed 
up.)

The fire analagy illustrates a completely accurate likeness to the 
situation of you using 'coward' without 'truly thinking of [one] as 
female genitalia'. 

SEE!?

I *beleive* you aren't 'truly thinking of [one] as female genitalia.' 
I'm even providing a 2nd example of the exact case *you* are claiming.

Of course, instead of siezing on it and saying... "Exactly..." you call 
it rubbish, suggesting you are incapable of analytical thought.

Allow me to summarize the 'rubbish':

After *AGREEING* with you, via my fire metaphor, that the boss does not 
mean 'setting fire to' (and thus by analagy *you* only meant coward and 
not female genitalia) I went on to illustrate that even though all the 
'boss' meant was 'terminating employment' the etymological root of 
'setting fire to' persists as the source meaning. 

The conclusion you are supposed to come up with from that is this:

If words and meanings derived from from pre-existing ones will carry 
some of that baggage innuendo, even if that isn't the meaning you 
intend. 

If a large number of people beleive that it carries offensive baggage 
then it does! Period. 

EVEN IF **YOU** THINK THERE IS A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT DERIVES ALONG 
MORE INNOCENT LINES. 

Given that it's true origin is ultimately a matter of opinion and 
guesswork, you will have to cope with the *fact* (amply demonstrated 
here in this thread) that others, indeed *many* others, believe that it 
carries the female genitalia innuendo. Deal with it.

Finally, EVEN if the etymology in actual fact does not bear any 
offensiveness AT ALL. (Just as 'fire' to referring to 'terminated 
employment' carries no offense.) But if a domimant meaning of a word, 
even if just by mere chance of coincidence, in modern common usage *IS* 
offensive then it is still tactless and offensive to use any meaning of 
it... because of the inevitable double meaning.

Do you understand now?

The poster contends no such thing, in fact, nobody does.
