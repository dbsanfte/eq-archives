My druid has the Warden Symbol of Tunare, clicky grasping roots. Nice to be 
able to keep something parked for no mana.

My mage has: 
-Clay Bracelet, Instant Eye of Zomm
-Boots of Bladecalling off Velk 600dd I think, cast time is horrendous tho.
-The sol ro mage boots, forget what they're called, instant inv to animals.
-Used to have one of those player made clicky low lvl dd rings, vendored it 
a long time ago I guess, dunno whatever happened to it. lol Nice for 
pulling.

Can't remember beyond that, haven't played much in months.
