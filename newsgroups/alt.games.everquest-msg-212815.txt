Dunno, but I guess it's similar to the 'fear' effect, where you kind of see
yourself running, and then you stop, regain control, and find you're not
where you thought you'd run to.

I was feared in Gunthak recently, and while as far as my screen was
concerned, I'd swam a very short distance, when control was returned, I was
right next to the lighthouse.
