I had no choice, I had no money to buy lighter stuff, and I am not one for
going around asking for handouts.  I've gone weeks without seeing 'you are
no longer encumbered'. Only way to keep weight down was to put some of the
droppable stuff on a mule and I still had to keep some stuff on me.  I
couldn't even afford to buy 10slot bags to get those extra slots, I was so
happy when I found out that HQ hopper pelts could be used to make 10slot 10%
WR bags, I spent 2 weeks just gathering pelts in Shadeweaver when there
weren't that many newbies in there killing hoppers.  Took me a while because
I feel that they have more right to them seeing as that's the kitty newbie
zone and they need the stuff those things drop for quests noone else can do.

I don't know why you gotta be so hateful.  I'm not stupid or a child in need
of a scolding, I am a grown woman who didn't have the foggiest idea how to
play any RPG when I started and didn't know what to put into my starting
stats.  Yes, I made a mistake in how I started but I've worked with it.  I
don't understand why in a group you would want your main assist or even your
tank,(yes, rangers can tank) to be encumbered at all.  I throw any and all
spells I have on my group members.  I do understand not wanting to give out
spells that take components like symbols unless a component is given first
(my personal policy is 2 for 1, I give 2 components for each cast, only fair
to the caster)  Good luck in keeping your group together if you don't wanna
waste mana on your group.
