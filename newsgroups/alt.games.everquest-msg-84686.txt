The list at necro.eqclasses.com says you can buy it from Tkaz H'Rugla in the
Mage/Wiz/Ench guild in Neriak Commons. You can also get it in the necro guild in
Ak'Anon but I can't remember which Clockwork Merchant has it. It's probably the
merchant tucked back in the alcove - I know he has Shielding.
