99.9 % of people got  booted .  I was 1 of 7 that managed to stay in chat  2 of
whom were gm's,  the initial word from them was a major router near them went
awol.  Affected everybody regardless of where you lived.  Further problems
occured with the server trying to recycle everybody out of "error 1018 you have
an active character" and the pure number of people trying to relog at the same
time.

keep tring to log in and you might get lucky BUT if you got something else to
do for an hour or two - go do it. That way you don't have put up with the
arseholes in (11) chatrooms bitching and whining like the retarded 12 year olds
most of them are currently behaving like.

Don't think of it as being outnumbered,
think of it as unlimited target selection.
