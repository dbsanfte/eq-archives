Two comments.

1) Is it any more amazing than how much effort people will put into PLAYING a
game, just so they can ...

2) Why would you think that cheaters and bot users have as their only motive
"being more uber".  Wouldn't you expect the vast majority of motivations that
drive high-level players to raid, play, scan message boards, etc. to also
drive botters?

Specifically, being able to group with friends and be effective among others
is much easier if your character is similarly developed and equipped.  Buying,
botting, or grinding are the primary avenues open to someone trying to "catch
up".

I'd be interested in seeing such a list.  I think it's equally sad, for a
PvE player, to be offended by someone botting.  I can't argue about PvP, as
cheating clearly hurts others, but PvP with character progression sucks
already IMO.
