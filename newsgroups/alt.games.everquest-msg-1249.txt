Hell I don't think anybody really 'likes' bizbee. He's just the local
newsgroup grump. Kind of like that cranky old man down the street
that yells at everyone to stay off his lawn.

What's sad are the pathetic morons who read all his posts
and respond trying to get a rise out of him.

Why don't they just killfile him? That's what I did with all them
yet I still get all the responses to the responses.

If you don't like bizbee just killfile him. Is that so hard?
