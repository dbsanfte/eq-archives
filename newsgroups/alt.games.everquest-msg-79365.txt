In Sanctus Seru, there's the observation area WAY up on the wall, and
presumably levitate is forbidden because you could fly over to Lord Seru's
place and get in that way.

Seru was taken out a week or so ago on Ayonae Ro I think.  They got into his
room using Gflux + CoH.

His drops?
99ac 99 all stats 99 all saves magic lore (not no drop) BP All/all - the
catch?  those numbers are NEGATIVE. It's called  "Cuirass of Sad
Exploitation"

Sword of Truth (somebody on noows said it's Inte Akera's sword number 2, no
idea what that means), 100% to 1hs, something like 75 dmg 45 delay and 20
bane humanoid dmg and a metric assload of stats, magic lore nodrop, the
catch?  usable by None/None.

And as for that hole in Shadow Haven, if it's the one under the bridge to
Paludal, it takes you to Echo Caverns in the section that leads to The Deep.
(the "secret" zone in to Echo near the rogue trainer dude is the Fungus
Grove path)

If you mean the one under the bridge to the caster guilds, I don't know
firsthand where that goes, I too was afraid as hell to jump down there.
Watch it lead right to The Deep next to the Thought Horror Overfiend.
