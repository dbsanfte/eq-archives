Note that you don't actually need a skinning knife to make patchwork. You'll
find plenty of ruined pelts anyway, and you may want to save the higher
quality pelts for later tailoring.

It's pretty easy to get smithing up high enough so the items are trivial
(skinning knives are smithed items too) and do them yourself. It is however
very tedious to make stacks of studs and boning, which is why not many
smiths will sell at anything like cost for these items.

In high-end tailoring, a lot of the Velious gear requires smithed items
(velium studs and boning), so if you intend to take tailoring that high,
learning smithing is a good bet. Some of the other profitable items (Wu's
armour, backpacks) don't require smithing, but it's quite hard to get that
high without smithing at least somewhat and they tend to need other
components anyway (brewed items, enchanter created items, etc).
