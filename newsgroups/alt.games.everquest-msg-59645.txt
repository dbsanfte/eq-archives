There's nothing stoping you from grouping in Ice Clad right now.  I started
grouping there when I was 28th level cleric.  Then at 31st, I moved into
Eastern Wastes.  And at 37th level, I moved over to Dreadlands, where I
stayed until 45th level.  Actualy, at 48th level, I sometimes have to group
in dreadlands (even though i hate it.)  Karnors castle is beter for me (48th
cleric,) but there are times when karnors castle has 30+ people in it, which
is WAY too many for that zone.

havn't looked back since.)
