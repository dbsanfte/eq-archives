You may ask the ranger to go a bit easy at first. I remember grouping
with a 42 lvl Monk when my ranger was lvl 36 and I could easily outtaunt
the monk, (without hitting the taunt button).

It is hard to do, but I would stand there a bit and let the monk and the
mob duke it out a bit, then jump in, that seemed to work out best for
us.

Also, if I am taking too much damage too early on, I quit attacking and
back off, heal a little, and jump back in.
