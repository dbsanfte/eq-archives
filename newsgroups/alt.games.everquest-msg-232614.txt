Oh, get over it. What's with getting worked up over me taking offense
at lazy pricks who can't even enter the URL that's IN THEIR FUCKING
GAME MANUAL and looking at the links about downtime and server status?
It's not fucking rocket science. People need to learn to at least try
to figure things out for themselves before asking others for the
answers. Every patch day, there are STILL posts of "WAAHHH! I CAN'T
LOG IN! SOE SUXXORZ!!!". Yes, I'm fucking sick and tired after nearly
FIVE YEARS of the SAME SHIT. No, blowing it off with "OH, he's just a
newbie, he doesn't know better" DOES NOT CUT IT. He could have EASILY
found his answers without asking. This isn't something someone needs
experience or inside knowledge or some other such shit to know how to
do. All it takes is a little common sense and reasoning. Pandering to
people who aren't willing to use those basic learning skills on their
own only creates more idiots in our society.

These are the people who need the "Do not use in the shower" sign on
hair driers.
