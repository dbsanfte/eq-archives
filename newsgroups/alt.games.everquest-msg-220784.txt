I guess that all depends on where you stand politically, and which parts 
of history you choose to use as reference.

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that... I see the Federation 
in ST an eminently plausible extrapolation on how mankind seemed to be 
evolving socially and ethically throughout the mid-20th Century. Whether 
that trend stopped or even reversed in recent decades is fodder for a 
different thread.

For what it's worth, while I very much enjoyed the original Foundation 
trilogy, the books that came after (the ones I had the stomach to read, 
at least) appear to me to be the result of a head-on collision between 
self-indulgence and crack-smoking.

I think we do agree, but it kind of comes with the territory. If the 
premise of ST is that mankind is actually getting "whiter" (obviously, 
in the non-racial sense, for those late to the thread), the possible 
conflict between shades of white does not make for good prime-time 
television, hence "black".
