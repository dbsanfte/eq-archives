Pathing is how the any non-player (MoB, pet, NPC) moves around the
zone.  They will follow certain predetermined paths through the zone.
This has some interesting and sometimes dangerous repercussions.  If
you attack something from a distance, it may, in an area with poor
pathing, take off in the opposite direction attempting to get to you.
This may end up causing a train when it appeared you had a clear pull.
The same thing can happen with pets.  If you target a MoB that is near
and send your pet to attack it, your pet may take off in some random
direction trying to follow it's path to the MoB's location.  This is
bad.  The best way around this is to try to pick up on the pathing in
the zone, especially if you are the puller.  Just learn which areas to
avoid when pulling or where to position your pet.  Unrest has fairly
bad pathing inside the house.  Mistmoore is another zone with some
curious pathing effects.  I know there are other areas to look out for,
but my coffee isn't working yet, so maybe someone else can add to this.
