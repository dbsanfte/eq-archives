So everyone suffers so no one can get PL, something better done in
other zones anyway. Otoh a 52 cleric ,for example, can function very
well in high level groups but no we gotta find a 58 or above so people
cant PL, shessh now thats a ripoff. Theres a lot of things we have to
deal with so people cant "cheat" and ya know what? Who cares if they
do? We just want to be able to put a group together quickly and
freakin play.

Any more sarcasim or is it impossible to discuss the issue at hand
like an adult?
