Well that does happen.. but its not what you expect from the average player,
let alone a dearly beloved guildie

Why don't they have a chance?

A very close friend of mine who I helped on earlier steps of the epic was at
the rage stage, and in a very small guild.

When she told me he popped, I spoke to my guild leader and he let me take
everybody to skyfire.  We had just formed in random_zone for a raid so all
being together meant within a minute of saying rage was up everybody was
grouped with porters and ready to go.

6 of us had ported initially with a wizard, said "all to SF please" and by
the time we had ran from the wiz port to the druid evac spot, we had 40+
people at the druid port.

Im quite sure other clerics in small/no guild have friends in larger guilds
that would do the same for them
