I've never mentioned Poland in any of my posts - by what passes for a
thought process in your world, I must never have heard of it, either.

I've never claimed to know "a lot" about viruses - I've simply stated
that by taking reasonable precautions, one can protect themselves from
account theft.

Stating my credentials on-line doesn't count as trolling or as
dis-information. But that you would claim so is in perfect keeping
with your tactics so far.

This hang-up you have with definitions really is arguing semantics,
you know, even though you say it isn't.

You're the one who claimed that "it is easy for them to download the
software from a cracker site." Which is pretty much what script
kiddies do - download and use software without any real comprehension
of how it actually works.

I know this may shock you, but it looks to me like we're both right on
this point. Yes, I know, you'd rather argue with me about it, but I
can't see on what grounds you would. No doubt you'll find something.

>Refute this, troll:

I'm not interested in reading this long-winded near spam for a third
time, especially as you have dropped to the point of name calling.

Oh, and Sheila? Speaking of trolling - what's with the oversized UO
advertising in your .sig?
