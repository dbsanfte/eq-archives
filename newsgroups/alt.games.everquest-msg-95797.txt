For bards that have learned to swarm kite well, it may be slow, but man...
you can take down a lot of mobs at once!

In a pair it works really well.  The bard gets sow and runs figure eights
or ovals pulling 4-10 mobs behind him/her.  On every turn, you burn them with either
DDD or CoD hitting some subset of the swarm.  Eventually some of them wander
off dying.  The partner cleans those up by meleeing or nuking.  The bard
continues swarm kiting, hopefully picking up as many adds as he is killing.

You can do this almost continuously if you have the patience and a good supply
of adds.

Unfortunately, this takes a lot of practice, and is quite dangerous.  If
you miscalculate the turn and get stunned, it can be a rapid death.  Also
you don't want to be swarm kiting casting mobs.  It's best to choose a third
person perspective for swarm kiting so you know where your mobs are.

Practice on greens, slowly increasing the size of the swarm for a while till
you get the hang of it.

Most people haven't seen swarm kiting in action, so they will wonder what the
heck you are doing.  Sometimes they will think you are running frantically
from the mobs and will try to pull some of them off for you.  Have a hot key
ready that says, "Don't worry!  I'm swarm kiting.  Thanks!"
