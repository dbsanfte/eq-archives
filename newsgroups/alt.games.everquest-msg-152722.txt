well if you werent so busy trying to get all pissy, you would realize hge
was trying to help and  give you the closest to what you asked for, EQW, to
my knowledge,  runs everquest in a window kinda liek a web browser, and you
can minimize the window to surf other sites or what not, there is no way to
"shut down" eq while you are AFK, shuttin down eq means disconnections form
their servers,  and  to stay in game you need to stay connected to the
servers
