(Grumble grumble) I moved my human monk Witte from Qeynos to
Freeport. He had gone from level 6 to level 9 in Blackburrow.
I am amiable with the Ashen Order. And I *still* can't get the
damn sashes. I can chat with the person who hands out the
training sash, I can get the quest, but when I turn in the
deathfist pawn scalps, all I get is a "You have done nothing
to offend our order but we will give you nothing until you
have better shown your loyalty." Do I need to be kindly or
even allied with them to get the f-ing 1st level sash?
