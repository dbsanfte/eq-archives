WAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGH!  Do you know I got called a NEWB for trying to tell
two idiots there's no such thing a "lore" or "nerfed" centi LS?  They
argued with me for TEN minutes, with me continually asking for proof.
Hell, I even offered to trade my "pre nerfed" centi for a "lore" if
they could show me one.  WELL...in the end, they sure did have proof.
They gave me a name....I sent a tell... "excuse me, but are you the
guy with the lore centi LS?"; reply was "no, I don't have one, but I
know a guy...blah blah blah".  Man, that one SO gets under my skin.
Does it show?
