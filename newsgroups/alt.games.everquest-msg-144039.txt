Actually, the prices were quite decent... To my surprise, the OT folks liked
my Erudite Mage. Can't remember my deity thou :) (who does, hands up? =))

Btw.. I have been conning around to see how people like me. I have come to
the conclusion that i am liked in rather fwe places. I am going to roleplay
this character as a hater of short folks. I have got a good start in
Akanaon, camping one mechanic. Even got a short PvP encounter =))
One annoying gnome wiz jester (level 5 or something) came by, jumping
around, telling jokes and generally making jack-ass of himself (I think
erudites don't have much of a sense of humour?). So i challenged the poor
thing to a duel, he accepted and my pet killed him quite fast. :)
I like my new style :)
Next one on the list are the sceptic dorfs who glance at me dubiously. I'll
show them! (Once i have evels to kill the dorfs on the dock).
I haven't yet checked the levels of stuff in misty so i think that will be
the last place to f*ck my faction in.

I haven't even checked if i need some of these factions in my epic, but
hell. if i am forced to deal with the midgets, i can bite the bullet, fix my
faction temporarily and kill them all over again!
Muaahahaa! (that is supposed to be a hideous laughter) The fools!

:)

Man.. Talk about morning cofeine rush. What the hell did this have to do
with the original topic =))
