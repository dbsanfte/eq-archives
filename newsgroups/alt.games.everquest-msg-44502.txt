Healing is Alteration, buffs are Abjuration.
And yes, Superior Healing was fubarred for Druids/Shamans.

The maximum fizzle rate as stated was suppose to be hard capped at
20%.  However, at level 60 with alteration specialization, and 220+
WIS I was seeing over 35% fizzle rate on SupHeal.

Currently the group cold/fire resist spells for druids and group
poison/disease resists for shamans are STILL fubarred.
