Hi all,

I wondered if anyone could possibly help with a problem that I've had in 
the past couple of days in connecting to the Mithaniel Marr server 
(though I realise the problem is not the Mith Marr server);

First though- I'll explain when it started. I was memming new spells 
with my alt just outside Crushbone in Greater Faydark when I lost the 
connection to the server.

Now whenever I get back to the server screen and click to go into the 
character screen it will stop at "Loading equipment and armor" and crash 
to the desktop.

I have gone for a complete file check- downloaded some files (I have all 
the options selected)- and it has not fixed the problem.

Someone in the chat mentioned that it could potentially be a UI problem 
but since I use the default UI I doubt that that is the problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou.

Warwick
