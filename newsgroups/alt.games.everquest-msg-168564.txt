Each class has a vendor that sells their level 61 spell, its this guy that you do that
class hand-in to.

If you want a cleric spell, go in the library, take the right entrance, turn right and go
down the stairwell there.  One flight down, right in front of you, is a milkelf vicar,
thats your boy.

The correct enchanter is a gnome female.
