I think SB has promise, but they're going to have to pay a lot of
attention to limiting grief players.

Some things that will turn me off: 

- If any high-level player can kill low-level players with no
significant disincentive
- If I get ganked every time I move (like on the DAOC PvP servers)
- If I spend more time trying to recover from ganks than I do
advancing

I liked the EQ racewar PvP, because if you were a Wood Elf and you saw
a Dark Elf, you knew you were in danger. But if you were hanging out
in Faydark, you were pretty sure you were safe. Likewise, on regular
DAOC servers, you have to GO to a PvP area, and even then, you know
you're not going to get attacked by people from your own realm.
