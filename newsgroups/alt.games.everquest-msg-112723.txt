Was waiting for the GFey spires to fire up to Luclin yesterday after a
raid, and saw a guy /auctioning looking for the services of a smith.
Having some time to kill, and figuring that a level six probably just
wanted a skinning knife, or maybe some banded or something, I sent him a
tell asking what I wanted and saying I'd help him out.

He comes back telling me that he needs two "Unstained Steel
Breastplates" so he can "use a couple emeralds to finish this quest
twice". Told him I wasn't sure what that was, what the recipie was, or
what it trivialed at, so I didn't know if I could help him or not.

He gives me the recipie: Smithing hammer, water flask, padding, breast
plate mold, three folded metal sheets. (Going by memory here... not one
hundred percent certain of the exact wording he used.) Says it trivials
at two twenty something. (after he looks it up) He also tells me "money
is no object." ROFL. Obviously not a newbie.

Sounded just like a regular Plate armor BP to me, unless the "breast
plate mold" is something different.  Anyone know what this might be if
it wasn't just regular plate armor, or what quest he was talking about?
