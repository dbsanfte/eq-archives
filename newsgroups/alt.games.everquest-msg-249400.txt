But that's how the entire game works. You go to Guk for guk drops, you 
got to EP for EP drops, you have *always* had to go where the drops 
were. Until now you had to stay there a random (and lengthy) amount of 
time in one exact spot, with no reward for most of the group. LDoN is a 
vast improvement in that regard.

You've always had to do this. To get your Eye of the Owlbear Mother you 
have to run the Hollowshade War... to get your ring of the goblin lords 
you have to go to solA, to get your nostrolo's tambourine you had to 
take the group through dalnir, CoM, Kaesora... to get your mage epic you 
have to take the group to the plane of hate & sky... I'm boggled that 
you find LDoN offensive when the rest of the game is far more tedious 
for drops.
