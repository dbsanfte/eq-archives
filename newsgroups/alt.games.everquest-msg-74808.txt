I seem to be hunting the back side of the fort, on the perimeter atm.  At
first I thought it was the front door, then as I scouted around the complete
perimeter I saw a bridge with two giants standing guard.  The dim lightbulb
in my head brightened a bit ... ah-ha, this must be the front door of the
fort.

Also, re: the legchoppers ... is that 60pp from a vendor, or 60pp in EC?
I'm not particularly greedy, but at the same time the lvl 24 spells that I
bought pretty well drained the bank. <g>

Many, many thanks to all on the info on the "safe meditation rock".  I knew
that there had to be an easier way than porting to Surefall or camoing every
time I went to med.
