    The standard answer: the pile-up of players would move from Skyfire to
the next raid zone. Ideally, you have players all killing things at
different levels based entirely on how much time they've spent playing EQ.
That means people don't squabble over the same content, and there's a
"progression" to what a guild kills. The cleric epic is one of those things
in game that can immediately jump a guild up to stuff at the next difficulty
level. You can recover faster after a fight. You can recover DURING a fight,
and simulate greater numbers than you actually have. You can "box" (click a
res on a cleric, and have them wait to take it until the area is safe)
clerics and avoid having to start over if you wipe out - that means more
attempts on a new mob in a given day.

    Of course, the standard answer is the one invariably given by guilds on
the top of the heap that don't like losing their loot pinatas. But you can
see why Verant might support it. They don't want people squabbling over
content, or demanding that more content be put in game.

    In EQ, hard should equal time-consuming. NOTHING else can stop a guild.
One guild on my server has a friend in Darkenbane on Antonius Bayle feeding
them strategies. The first time they went up to the Emperor's room in Ssra,
they wiped to what they thought was the Blood's AoE in the antechamber. The
second time they went up, they all had pretargetting hotkeys, knew what mobs
to debuff how, the works. Learning curve? Not when someone else has done the
work and tells you how to do it. As an aside, somehow they still wiped
before killing Blood. Just like they still wipe from time to time on the
other Ssra mobs they grabbed strategies for off the Safehouse. Apparently
having a no-talent bunch of hacks and second-boxed characters can still lead
to failure.
