Beats me. If you're implying that I have my Lokari name registered on
every server, you're quite incorrect. I have exactly two instances of
characters named that, and I don't play either of them.

I think perhaps a better question might be "what kind of anal
retentive ass would try to register someone else's Usenet name on
every God damn server?"

But I guess the answer to that question is clear.

>You insecure?

Not particularly, no.

>Get a boyfriend woman

Unnecessary - I'm married.

>even fat girls need it.

Which should improve your chances, as well as explain any limited
successes.
