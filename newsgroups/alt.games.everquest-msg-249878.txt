Which is exactly what I believe this idea of officially sanctioned
items for money displays, a complete lack of understanding of what
they've actually made.

The entire concept is abhorrent to me. I play a game to succeed within
the confines of that game. You could bribe your friend the DM with
$20.00 to let your 1st level Pally have a Holy Avenger in D&D, but
that invalidates the success within the game. Paying for items equates
success within the game with real world monetary value. Either bought
or sold. This invalidates my reason for playing the game.

Right now, if you use IGE or any of these other services, you are
cheating. Just like changing the +1 to a +3 on your character sheet in
D&D. I might break down and buy 10,000 plat from IGE, but I would
still be cheating. When it becomes officially sanctioned, it's not
cheating anymore, now official success within the game is tied with
your wallet.

Why play the game when I can just head back to work and do a little
overtime? I get better items that way anyway.

If you don't agree with the sentiment, then there is no reason to
debate is any longer. You could go on all day long about "Safe" ways
to do it, which I'm sure they can come up with. It's not about them
maintaining a server side economy, which I'm sure they can do by
adjusting the drop rates (or spawn rates in a GM's bag). It's the
entire concept that bothers me.

Though the end result of the concept makes little difference to me,
(since the instant they put that idea into play, my reason for playing
the game becomes invalid) I feel I must offer a prognostication, if
SoE allows player to player trades for money, you will see 500 new
players on every server forming guilds to monopolize content in order
to get the drops to sell. If not because the inherent value of the
items, but also preventing others from getting the drops improves the
value of what they already have. Of course the existing guilds will
get in on it too. You think that the early days of EQ, where Kill
Stealing and Training, and everything else that goes along with it was
bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. Money makes people do funny things.

No doubt that the money you could make from EQ would be less than your
average job in the UK or US, but even a single dollar an hour from
farming would be huge in China, India, Vietnam, etc... I have no ill
will against them for doing it, because honestly, anyone who makes an
effort to improve their quality of living should do so, but that
doesnï¿½t change the outcome.

I'll be watching from the sidelines, because this will be interesting.
Will SoE make enough money to offset the cost of the additional GM's
they will need to keep the game running, or will it all make swirling
sounds as it goes down the drain?
