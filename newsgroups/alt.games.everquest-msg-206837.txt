Could be useful, I would guess, on a PvP server.  I would guess that many
people would be less likely to con a skeleton than a PC (even of their
race).

I believe that when something is listed as "V1 (L1) to V2 (L2)", then it is
linear between them.  So, "18% (L12) to 30% (L60)" would be 12% over 48
levels, or a 1% increase every 4 levels, whereas "32% (L24) to 50% (L60)" is
18% over 36 levels, or 1% every 2 levels, or 2% every 4 levels.  That would
give these values:

    Level   Percents for the two spells
    12      18
    16      19
    20      20
    24      21      32
    28      22      34
    32      23      36
    36      24      38
    40      25      40
    44      26      42
    48      27      44
    52      28      46
    56      29      48
    60      30      50

So, best case 5/3 the slow for twice the price.  I guess the way you'd
decide which to use is by comparing your mana use to the healer's.  If the
healer is using too much mana healing, you can use the more expensive slow,
to save the healer some mana.  (This is how in a routine group or routine
fight on a raid I decide with my Wizard how much to nuke.  If I'm standing
around with FM while the other casters are medding, I'm not nuking enough.
If I'm always the last to be ready for the next fight, I'm nuking too much).

Loot carrying?  The things I'm killing now with my Wizard drop swords that
weight something like 2 or 3, and sell for 4 plat.  10 str, especially with
a weight reducing bag, would mean several more kills before having to go
deal with the loot.

Hmmm...would this be useful when fighting under water?

BTW, at your level, you get enough warning when this wears out to mem it and
renew it without losing the buff.  This is useful, because, unlike the
priest HP buffs, the INT caster buffs don't raise current HP.  They just
raise max HP.  So, if you lose the buff and recast it, you end up not at
full health.

It's been claimed that a blow that is entirely absorbed by a rune spell has
a much lower chance of stunning, or interrupting casting.
