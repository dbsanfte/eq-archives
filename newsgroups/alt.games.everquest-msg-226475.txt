How is this any different than my local Tesoro/Sunoco/BP
Amoco/Phillips/Conoco/Super America/etc... offering me a free 6 pack of Coke
for buying 8 gallons of gas.  Surely Coca-Cola has no direct relation to
gas, it MIGHT however entice me to purchase gas from that station instead of
the mom & pop across the street, even if the Mom & Pop store is a couple of
cents cheaper per gallon.  Same deal.
