Why say you are going to do something and then fail to do it.  People who we
think are our friends do this.  They take you for granted when they show up
an hour or to late for an event or whatever it might be that they are late
for... yet again.  They act sorry, but in reality they could care less.

If you want to go to a movie, or dinner, or drinking, or whatever.... why
say 4 o'clock when you mean 6 o'clock?  Why make the plan when you KNOW that
you are basically lieing and have no real intention of showing up on time
anyway.

You know this because you are CONSTANTLY late... you can't remember the last
time you were ON time.  Yet, you do it over and over again basically
creating problems for all involved.  Then, to top it off... you expect
everyone to be glowing and happy when you arrive like now that you are here
all is forgotton about you being a complete asshole without an adult thought
in your brain.

So keep on doing it.  Keep on being a self absorbed little child that can
only think about his own personnal gains and pleasures.  After all, you
might lose some friends. Ahhh, but there will be many more dolts to be duped
in your wake right?  Afterall, you have the fast car, or the best ball, or
the best drugs, women, food, TV - whatever it might be.  You got em strung
along like Bob Dole on Brittney Spears.

Ohhh, but nevermind it all.  You got a snappy new colorfull answering
machine now.  It is great because it tells everyone that you fucked up the
entire day.  It also tells them that you could care less.  You will be there
whenever the hell you want to be.  Screw all previous promises.  Screw every
dumbass commitment you have ever made because you are batting 1000.  And you
are so sorry too.

Funny how it is all sewn up like a fantasy book.  Not only do you do
whatever you want whenever you want to, when your "friends" DO get a hold of
you.... THEY have to pay to be there.  They have to pay for YOU.

I have to say, you are one incredible entity that could only be derived from
and within this world.

I whine because I like to.  It makes me irrational and dangerous.
