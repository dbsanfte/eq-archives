Go to eqclient.ini and add these lines to the general section (top part) of
the file:

UseUmbra=FALSE
UseTnL=FALSE

There's also a line about pixels and character bits.  The choices are either
16 or 32.  If it's 32, change it to 16.  If it's 16, leave it alone.

If this still isn't fast enough, read on.

Go into the Options menu (the Options button that you can hit BEFORE you log
in) and fiddle with the settings.  Leave the video card screen alone, go to
the next one.  Start removing new Luclin models that you don't really care
about (example, I hate the new shiny huge erudite foreheads so I turned that
off).   Go to the next page and turn things off or on, depending on taste.
Verant supplies decent tips on each of those options.  If it says "do this
to use less memory" chances are it also means "and the game will go faster."
