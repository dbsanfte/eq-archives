Yes, Divine aura will shield you from the fall.  However, if you are KoS in
the Hole, you will be pummeled as soon as DA wears off.  If you are non-kos
and Yael is up, he will death touch you (and if DA takes it, He'll just
pummel you).  If you are a Cleric of Brell and non-kos and Yael is not up,
dive in, cast DA, land, run to the safe spot and have a mule halfling rogue
drag a dead mage to you.  You then res the mage and CoH your raid to the
safe spot, and boom, instant Scale Keeper Raid.
