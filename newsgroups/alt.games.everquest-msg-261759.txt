Personally, I tend to not do this sort of thing, although I have on 
occaision.  This explains why my casters don't have maxed 
specializations, my melee character doesn't have his unused skills 
capped, and so on.

But I'm not certain I'd call it cheating.  Its possible to achieve the 
same end by sitting there repeatedly pressing the button, after all.  If 
the designers didn't want it to be possible, they'd surely just make it 
so you have to be in a melee in order to increase those skills.  Its 
been common practice to go sit somewhere safe and chain cast low level 
spells to max out casting skills since very shortly after release, but 
its still done all the time and nobody is making a secret of it.

Its not to my taste, as a rule, but given that its a matter of taste, 
I'm happy to explain -how- to stuffed tomatoes even though I don't care 
to eat them myself.
