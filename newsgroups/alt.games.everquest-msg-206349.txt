(1) The RNG is streaky.
(2) The following is speculation based on insufficient data:
When the mobs in some areas go unhunted for long periods of
time drop rates seem to skyrocket.  I've seen this with silk,
bear/cat pelts, and wisp stones.  It could, of course, just
be more streaky RNG behavior.  It could also be easily set
up with some pretty simple spawn/despawn rules for the mobs,
which is what I suspect goes on in a few cases at least.
