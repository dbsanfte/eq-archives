If you're still playing EQ1, why not just submit for the EQ2 Beta?  You
probably won't get tapped, but you never know.  Then you can try it for free
and see what it's like.  Worst case, you waste a few days deciding you don't
like it and won't buy it when it goes live.  Best (sort of) case, you get
sucked into another version of EverCrack for another 5 years.
