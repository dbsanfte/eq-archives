:D

You're right the security risk to a security savvy person is minimized 
by that savviness.

Suppose I setup my brother in-laws computer... turned IE off, set him up 
with Firefox and left him a secure system, and he's been happy as a clam.

Were *he* to go and apply for the eq2 beta (or his teenage kid)... he 
finds out he needs IE... so he goes and reenables it -- google isn't 
hard to use, he finds out activex still isnt working so he goes in and 
starts turning things on -- he's not a moron (nor are his kids) and IE 
gives somewhat helpful error messages -- anybody can turn things on 
until it works... finally the beta app works... and he has no idea what 
he did or really how to undo it all, nor is he really concerned about 
it...since he's not paranoid, and everything he wants to do still works. 
He's not savvy to the risks. Nobody told him there were any risks.

Now IE may have requested to re-assert itself as the 'default browser' 
upon launch...and in a misguided effort to get the beta app working he 
may have said yes...and suddenly that computer is browsing with ActiveX 
and IE running wide open...with no one security savvy the wiser... and 
sooner or later he or his kid goes somewhere stupid...

Now you could argue its his own fault, and to an extent you'd be right.

But really, the guy is just clueless (maybe while turning activeX on he 
even enabled the 'just do it and don't prompt me' option. Sony told him 
what to do (use IE and ActiveX), and he did it, trusting Sony. Sony did 
not tell him that there were risks, did not tell him to turn activeX off 
afterwards, etc etc etc...

Joe average doesn't know how the average email virus works nevermind the 
more exotic stuff, I routinely talk to people who are concerned they 
they are infected because there is a blocked message notification from 
Norton in their inbox...

Its like a trusted neighbor showing up at your door while your napping, 
and them having your 3 year old kid retrieve the keys to unlock an 
obscure entrance to your property (manufacture a plausible reason -- to 
return something they borrowed to your tool shed for example)...but the 
neighbour neglects to get your kid to lock it back up... so your shed is 
unlocked indefinately because you rarely use it...

You can't really blame your 3 year old kid, and there was no risk from 
the trusted neighbor himself, .. but it was highly irresponsible of him 
to do what he did.

Ditto sony as the 'trustworthy neighbour'

The difference being that that this is an active task, while neglecting 
to properly re-secure IE and having software surreptitiously install 
itself is a passive activity... ie you don't have to do anything at all 
to screw it up.
