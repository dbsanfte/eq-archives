On a not particularly related note...

One of the very few programs in my icon try until recently was McAfee
virus scan. One of its components recently began giving me memory
errors at bootup, so I renamed that particular file. Then, of course,
McAfee in general whined that it couldn't find that program at bootup.

So I uninstalled McAfee completely, and reinstalled it. What should
happen, but my computer goes into a permanent loop of rebooting.

Since no other program finds a memory problem, and since I hated the
McAfee program anyway, I nuked it.


Now I'm looking for a replacement virus package. I want one that gives
*me* control. I don't want it installing itself into every damn nook
and cranny on the computer. I don't want it loading automatically at
start up. I don't want it routing my mail through some distant server
for virus checking before delivery.

All I want is a program that lets me do a full scan when *I* decide,
lets me right click and scan an individual file, keeps an up-to-date
virus list, and which preferably doesn't spend a lot of time on a
fancy skinned interface.

Any suggestions, anyone?
