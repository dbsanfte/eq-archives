this was the most distressing part to me:

EverQuest II will deliver a unique online gaming experience to players with
a cast of more than 100 actors,

including well-known Hollywood talent.
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Awww, crap...  hollywood talent?  Jeremy Irons as the voice of Nexus.  Pat
Sajak as the Casino Operator.  CarrotTop as Banker Ceridan.  MacCauley
Culkin as Halfling Warrior Guild Master.  Special Appearance by Andy Serkis
(look him up!) as the voice of Fippy Darkpaw!

GROAN!
