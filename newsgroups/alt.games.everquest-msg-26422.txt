Or maybe, just maybe, what they really love is to sit back and look at a
game they can be proud of.  That means that when someone comes along and
craps all over it by cheating they feel the need to clean up.  Sort of
like the apartment manager who kicks out the guy with 50 cats not
because he hates the guy or the cats, but because the rest of the folks
living in the building can't stand the stench and he has a
responsibility to them as paying renters to provide a habitable
environment.

pulled over by the cops for speeding I'd have to trade my scoot in for a
sukv if they weren't out there doing their job.
