That's flat out bullshit.  Among at least some primates the
dominant males mount other males to assert and reinforce their
dominance.  That's right, Bubba's not your "date", he's your
boss.  That's about as far from being ostracized as you can
get, and one of my favorite "factoids" to throw in the face of
the occasional reactionary pseudo-philosopher I encounter who
touts "natural law" as justification for disenfranchising women,
gays, or whoever.  Somehow they just can't get comfortable with
the idea being literally fucked in the ass by every guy higher
on the totem pole than them.
