Beastiary info for Corrupted Seahorse:
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5311

Kedge Keep Raid Guide:
http://pub72.ezboard.com/fscarab14802frm6.showMessage?topicID=7.topic

No specific info on the tainted/corrupted seahorse in the above raid guide 
(kinda old info in it I think), but it spawns in the seahorse caves, which 
are covered there, iirc it has strategy on how to get to and pull that 
area.
