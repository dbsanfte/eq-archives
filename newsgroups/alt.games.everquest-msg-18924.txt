Probably because you F'd up. They don't fix your Fs.

Ya right, we're all brain washed. :-P

Maybe we all like this freaking cloud still because when we make
mistakes we don't throw tantrums, we suck it up and play on.

The only thing you sound addicted to is being a victim. The quests

revelation; EQ was victimizing your personal life.

Wow, life just "happens" to you doesn't it?
