Hi all, have anyone figured out how to do the quest given by the DE npc?
(cant remember the name, is Xsomething)
I know he need a eye of revenus, blood(or bone) tallon
and Incantation of blood for end it, but  can't figure out how to get the
incantation of bloob, the npc say something about Archon , another de npc,
and i'm been able to spack with him for a bit, but i'm stuck at the second
keyword, i'm almost sure you no need to kill him, another strange creature
is "a maddened priest" indiff to everyone, gove no faction hit if killed and
seen to drop nothink, maybe the npc speach about him but it can be
misundestud.
If anyone got some info on how to end this quest please post it.
Tnx alot.

Nottun 60 cleric of Innoruuk
