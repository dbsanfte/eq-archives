I don't know...I think it has something to do with
charm/fear on a player.

EE's do both.

The other day I was dueling a friend so we could
practice Bind Wounds and I had an Instill Doubt
stick.  Not only did she go LD immediately, but a
level 54 druid standing nearby snared and then
DoT'd her.  She died before she could log back
on, and it was an exp-loss death.  It appeared
that since my lil' friend went LD it was no longer
a one-on-one duel, and the asshole just took
advantage to grief on a blue server.
