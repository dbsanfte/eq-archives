It's not the tank's job to pay for Symbol, either (or the enchanter's
for that matter.) It's the group's job. The tank is there to do a
specific job, the same as the cleric is, from which the whole group
benefits.

As for carrying spell components, it's damned reasonable to expect the
cleric to do so. It's also the cleric's job to make sure that they get
paid for those components. And, if groups are picky about it, it's the
cleric's responsibility to leave them twisting in the wind.
