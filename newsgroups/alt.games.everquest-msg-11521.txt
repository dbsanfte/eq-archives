If you prefer outdoors and can get a full group together (bring your
own...unless you're a cleric or enchanter folks will try to tell you you're
too low and won't let you play any reindeer games), Dreadlands may just be
the place for you.  I strongly suggest you base yourself next to a zone line
though. :)

But dungeons give you more experience.  Nagafen's Lair (SolB) is a good zone
though you'll need a minimum 4 people at your level to feel comfortable in
the non-named areas.  Solusek's Eye (SolA) is also quite good (so is the
loot!) but that's definitely a BYOG zone.  At 35, though, you should be able
to get by with a healing partner (btw, fix your sig ;) ).

I hear Runnyeye is a good place now, though you'll probably want to wait a
couple weeks until people stop exploring the "new zone."  I'm kinda guessing
that even after that don't expect to kick way-too-damned-high level farmers
out of the good rooms.

Lower Guk is also a very viable option (I'm not a big fan of that zone, I
grew up in SolB).
