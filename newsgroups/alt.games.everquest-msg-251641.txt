Your point is moot.  You wont find anyone that will give you your platinum
back afte thirty days of using the weapon.  In real life economies there are
alot of ways to become an educated buyer.  Because of this there is less
price fluctuation and more stable economy.  What I am suggesting is a way to
achieve the same thing in the eq economy which at the moment is a real
problem and source of frustration to eq players.  I wont bother to
reitterate what has already been discussed in this thread already.
