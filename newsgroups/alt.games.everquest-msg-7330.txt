>How much to tailored backpacks weight?

THe tailored ten slot backpacks weigh the same as a regular backpack.  3.0 i
think.  I also think it has a reduction of 10% like all other tailored
containers (I assume)  I use a tailored large bag it holds six large slots has
a reduction of 10% and weighs only .8
For a monk this is the best container until i  can get ahold of like a tinkers
bag or something.
