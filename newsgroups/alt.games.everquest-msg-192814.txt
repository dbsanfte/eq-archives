I can help with this, having just leveled a beastlord into the 30s: get thee
to Paludal Caverns, pronto. At your level, enter from the Shadeweaver
Thicket end of the caverns (make sure you print out eqatlas maps of both
Paludal and Shadeweaver). Get a SOW and just run past the things walking
around in the tunnels in Shadeweaver, zone right in to Paludal. Explore the
caverns from there and you will find lots of blues and whites you can solo
successfully, and you'll love that dungeon experience bonus. When you get to
about 18 or so, go around and enter Paludal from Shadowhaven. The mobs are
bit higher at this end but only a bit. I had no trouble getting into groups
but also found good soloing spots and powered through several levels with
little trouble.

If you haven't already, visit www.eqbeastlord.com and check out the strategy
guides there.
