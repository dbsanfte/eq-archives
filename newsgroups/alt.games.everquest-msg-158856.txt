Now, I think I've finally begun to grasp the meaning of a lot of EQ
"high-end" terms, such as zerg, cheal rotation and so forth. But "high-end"
raid guides often just assume that the person reading knows all these terms
straight up. (I know, if you don't understand what it means, you're prolly
not good enough to do high-end raids anyway. Spare me the flaming, please.
They're fun to read at any level!)
But is there a website that has a "high-end" glossary? With all these terms,
and explanation of what they mean, and how they are carried out?
Any help would be appreciated.
