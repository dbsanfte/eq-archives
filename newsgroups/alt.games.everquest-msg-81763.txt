I've solved that problem.  Works every time.  When we're about to call it
quits, I ask the cleric, in /group "How many gems do we have to split after
paying for your dots?"  It puts them on the spot without anyone being
nasty...keeps the greedy ones honest.  I always have my eye out for about
how many gems drop...I don't write them down, I just keep my eye out.

My enchanter doesn't cast Rune V except on himself unless it's virtually
guaranteed that he'll be paid back. I'd rather die and get a 56 rez a few
times than shell out more than 50p of my own cash per raid (not reimbursed).
Hand me a stack of dots and I'll keep you in Rune V until those run out. :)
