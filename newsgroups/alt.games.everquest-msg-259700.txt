Same here. I easily 2-box on my dial-up with sound off on one account and
graphics turned way down.

That way, my 'lil zerker can lead the way and pull while the young druid
just follows around, heals and shares the xp.

However, my cleric main often has a hard time on big raids and I have to
turn everything off to not mess up CH rotation. On some nights, some lag was
so bad (namely in PoFire) I'd have to stick to rez and rebuff duty. PoTime
and GoD seem better than Elemental plains in that matter, go figure.
