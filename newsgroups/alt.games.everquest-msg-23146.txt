I have read many posts about the evils outnumbering the neuts and
goodies, but I was wonderng which classer are popping up more
often than others?  Also, do you think, most people are going in
to Sullon with a class they have already played on a blue
server?  Basically I have played to following:

High Elf Paladin
High Elf Enchanter
High Elf Mage
Dark Elf Enchanter
Half Elf Rogue
Half Elf Warrior
Iskar Monk
Dwarven Cleric
Gnomish Necro
Iskar Shadow Knight

With my main as a
Barbarian Shaman

(I have never listed them out, damn I've tried a lot of
characters).

Anyway my favorites are the Shaman, Necro, Monk and Warrior.  But
the Warrior was twinked by a friend so I'm not sure if that one
is very accurate.  I'm considering starting a character but I
don't want to be the cookie cutter blue server drOOd.  I am not
at all familiar with PvP, I have fought some of my firends and
guildies in the arena with my shammy and lost, so I know I'm
doing something wrong as I think Shammy's should kick but in
PvP.  Can anyone give me any advice on classes that don't apear
very often (or class/race/diety combinations)  I would assume
Gnomish Necro is rare...

Thanks any help will be greatly appreciated.
JB
