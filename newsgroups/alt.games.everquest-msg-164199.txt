    I've got news for you buddy, but my grand kids will live on the same
planet yours will.

    Most likely, anyway. And um, wandering around in the desert wont be
fixing the carbon dioxide problem, and the methane problem will slowly fix
itself over a century or two, so actually sitting on their asses for 8 hours
a day is about as contstructive as they can get so long as the plants are
growing in all the little greenhouses. More constructive than the current
generations daily activities.
