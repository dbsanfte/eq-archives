Is this the part where I say (with the 12-year-old mentality you have), "No,
YOU'RE the asshole!" and then feel smug
and satisfied, the way you feel when you post flames?
Nah, your life is punishment enough I'd wager based on the acrimonious,
self-righteous tone to your posts.

I think you have it bad enough already.  I'll let ya preen and strut for
your fans here and not respond to you any longer.  I'll consider you as
feces...
FLUSH

And, hey, Jizfree, now that you feel witty, do you feel pretty and bright?
*bursts into song*

[Top post *GASP*, just for you.  Did your world just crumble, your head
explode?  I'm rooting for the latter.]
