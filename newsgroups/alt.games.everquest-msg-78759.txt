Let me guess, High-Elf or Erudite enchanter?  I happen to be a dwarven
cleric. CHA started at 47, I believe, and I have it enhanced to about
65 with items. Attempts are more critical to me therefore, I have to
put a bit more thought and effort into it, because I suffer a lower
chance for success (lower WIS than your INT) and cannot recoup as much
of my loss from vendors.

Some might say, "It's your own fault for choosing a race/class not as
well suited for trade skill advancement." However, I never considered
trade skill ability abilities to be part of the criteria for choosing
an enjoyable character. After all, any race and class can be a
tradesman.
