I did so for Tempters a while ago, after talking with one of their leaders
about the fall of our guild (which pretty much left me as a guild leader).
Clan-X has been pretty signifcant, and then fell apart.  They're on their
way back up, and the future looks pretty good for them.  I'd recommend
taking a look for those who's guilds are teetering.
