It's always accompanied by *why* its a chicken little argument, at
least somewhere.

And there's where logic collapses into paranoid fear. You have to make
the leap of faith that just because what you perceive is cheapening
the game is happening now, it will get worse in the future.

There are ways to cheapen the game that would get me madder than hell,
but the closest they've ever come to it would be the nexus portal, and
it was limited enough to make it okay.

Until I see any reason to actually believe it (and you've presented
none), then I see no reason to assume worst case scenario..

'Clearly', if you are assuming worst case scenario and giving the
changes far more effect than they can possibly have.

The number of people who believe it is irrelevant.

Maybe so, I wouldn't argue against the idea the worst case scenario is
bad. However I need to see some actual proof that they're heading that
way, not uneasy mumblings about how some minor changes to low levels
and the removal of a couple annoyances is going to lead eventually to
EQ's downfall.

The difference is you're attacking the changes because of that
*possibility*, rather than judging the changes on their own merits.
