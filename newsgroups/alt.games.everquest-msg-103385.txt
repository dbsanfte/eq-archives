Hey... We all share your opinion of begging...  Heck... Some people have
resorted to doing evil things...

Like the 10k copper drop, the Mod Rod...  And with the recent changes in
patch, the most evil thing you can do...  Ulthork Tunic a level 1.

*waits for people to see the issue*  That's right, kids...  With the new
patch that allows 1-10 players to respawn with their GEAR On...  You create
an evil death loop that not even the GM can save you from.  At the same
time... You will cause a disruption issue, cause while the guy is dying, he
is leaving corpses...  And if he leaves enough corpses, that general area
begins to lag.  I, personally saw on a server 4 different characters with
piles of corpses...  My system, a 1.4gig with a GeForce 3 and 512 megs of
ram computer start to lag like hell looking at the 40+ corpse piles.

Suffice it to say...  Begging is bad.  Harassing and spamming a zone for
stuff or gear while you are a lowbie... Even real bad.  On my play server,
I knew of one guy who thought it was a good idea to bug the hell out of
people to give him gear.  People did give him stuff, and it didn't shut him
up.  He went on harassing or insulting people who did not give him or
provide him gear he wanted.  He is still a jackass to this day.

There are some people who will give out stuff for free, you just have to
listen and pay attention.  Bugging high level for stuff is not the way to
go.
