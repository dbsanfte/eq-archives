Hi everyone.

I'll make a few updates to my original post and concerning Eclypto.

First of all I did not make this up, this did occur on the Bertoxxolous server
about 2 and a half months ago (ok, so it wasn't THAT recent.) after the events
occured I saw Eclypto about 3 more times online, and I now remember some more
peculiar traits.

* I remember he was in a guild called Dukes of Magic - which appears to be dead
now, I located one ex-member named Cinderhand and he told me the guild was
"unorganized and fell apart after a month" he didn't remember anything
important about Eclypto

* I could not locate real friends of his, nor did any of the frequent-"Guk"ers
on my server (like Fare, Sentz, Zkull) remember seeing him in Guk even once
before that one weekend he was hunting there.

* Last I saw him online was December 15th(?) He had not levelled past 52.

* Each time I spotted him online, he was in North Freeport.

* He did not reply to my tells.

Since I hadn't seen him in a month or so, I tried something last night out of
curiousity - I tried making the name "Eclypto" and surprise surprise, I
succesfully created the character without a problem, this means either 2
things:
Either Eclypto deleted his level 52 druid - which seems nonsensical to me.
Or he was banned for cheating.

My best theory that I can come up with is the mysterious Eclypto somehow
learned to hack into the EQ database. (don't ask how) created a quick
high-level druid, headed to Lower Guk, won a ton of great items, immediately
twinked them over to another character on a different account that was
stationed in North Freeport, and then when he was finished he cancelled that
account and moved on.

My other theory is, he was a renegade GM's character who was screwing with
/random rolls for the fun of it. Eventually he was caught and fired. 

One last theory is he was not cheating but just incredibly lucky beyond belief,
and he was banned after he was caught selling his wares on Ebay or something.

Whatever the case is, his name is still infamous around Lower Guk, you can ask
most people who hunt there frequently about Eclypto and they will back me up.
