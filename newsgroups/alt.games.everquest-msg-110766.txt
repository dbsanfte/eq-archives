I second that.  I started off there so I got used to it and thought it was
the status quo.  Practically everyone was exceptionally nice during my
entire 35 levels.  I was wondering where all these A$$H*%ES that people
always keep bringing up where.  Then I wanted to create my second character
and went to another server.  Within the first single digit levels, already
met my share of them.  Wow, what a difference.  Plus it IS so much nosier.

I wish I could create more than one character on FV but of course, that
would just make twinking easier on that server.  I was "twinked" by items
and spells on the other server and while it's fun in the beginning, I feel
like I'm cheating.  I'm so used to the 20 level limit of buffs on FV that
when a 50th level person buffed me at level 4, I was taking on creatures
that were deep red to me (I shouldn't have been able to take on for another
10 levels or so).  So far, it's been A LOT easier leveling my non-FV
character because of all these enhancements.

No biggie, tho.  I'm still having a lot of fun and it's almost like
experiencing a mirror universe, where everything is the same, but not quite.
