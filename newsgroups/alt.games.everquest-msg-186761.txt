Percentages ARE standard numbers...  yay for math.

1000% = 10 multiple
100% = 1 multiple
10% = .1 multiple
1% = 0.01 multiple

If you multuply, say 100,000 exp by a 75% ZEM, it's the same as multuplying
by .75, either way nets you 75,000 exp.

Same for if you take that 100,000 exp and a 145% ZEM (the tier 1 pop zones),
same as 1.45, both get 145,000 exp.

The only thing is that the eq datastream no longer transmits exp as a raw
number, but as an x/330 percentage, presumably to keep showeq'ers from being
able to notice when they change the way that exp is earned.

&threadid=2586&highlight=ZEM

Just make sure you read carefully, if you just look at the list it seems
like most zones (including some that don't exist) have 50% ZEM, but the 50
just means that they don't have the ZEM for that zone.

Notice, CS is 75% (default outdoor), Velks and The Deep are both 85%
(default dungeon), Ssra and the Hole are both 100% (hard/underused dungeon),
and PoP tier 1 + PoV are all 145% ZEM.  PoStorms is higher than 145% (per
patch message indicating they raised postorms ZEM.
