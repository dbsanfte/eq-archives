The druid females and the caster men are reasonably nasty. You should
definitly use harmony to single pull them. They arnt bad for loot... the
sashes they drop can be quested for bronze weapons and xp. I wouldnt hunt
these guys for xp tho, the casters just make it not worth it. If you want to
upgrade, my suggestion would be to save up for a magical weapon or some sort
and go hunting will-o-wisps in WC. You can hand in the greater lightstones
to one of the gypsies in NK. Not too sure which one, just try hailing them
all. You get a caster thingy in return which sells for quite a lot more than
the lightstone. Then just buy what you need at the bazaar.
