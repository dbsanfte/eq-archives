What minor infraction? You are using it within the license they have
granted you. If they think they are losing money they can charge more
for the rental; but they can't sue me for damages.

The music industry was shut down when they went after mix tapes, and
mix cds... their strength on the P2P front is partly because it
amounts to public broadcasting, not simply because it was
'mainstream'.

The point was that some people, not necessarily you, think that
copyright gives IP owners all rights to their IP; it doesn't ... it
provides them specific rights to limit how their content is used...
but not blanket rights. In other words, copyright gives you the right
to tell people they can't broadcast it, and can't duplicate it...and a
few more, but it doesn't give them the right to tell people they can't
burn it nor is there any clear right which would apply to "handing in
game items to other subscribers in a mmog game".

Precisely, so you can't turn around and argue that transferring plat
is duping items or a violation of copyright. Whether your doing it for
money, favours, or in game assets is immaterial.

Whoah, back up. See the stars above? I never alleged it was generally
legal to set up shop there. ... In fact I agree that its entirely
illegal to do what I indicated, particularly systematically as a
business venture ... but the question isn't whether or not it is
legal... the question is whether or not the violation is one of
COPYRIGHT.

Is that really what you think you'd be charged with? I sure don't.

The basic principles of copyright are not being violated. A content
creator does not have the blanket right to prevent others from
profitting from their works... just the specific rights to prevent
others from performing specific activities with their works...
including broadcasting/duplicating/performing/etc for a profit (or
even without one)
