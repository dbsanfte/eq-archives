Get them.
You might not bother with the group ones right away, but get the
single ones, its still way faster than porting to planes of power and
taking the books. Save a bind point in POP and gate to the books to
get to teleports you don't have, like GFAY.

The single teleports are pretty cheap. You could hold out on the
group ones, it would give you a nice excuse to not port people..
ahaha. "Hey can you port me to .....?"  "SORRY, I AM POOR
AND NEVER BOUGHT ANY GROUP PORTS"  "wtf!?"  "IF YOU
HAND ME THE GROUP PORT TO THERE I'LL TAKE YOU!" "wtf!!?"
"GIVE ME 27 PLAT FOR IT AND I'LL SINGLE PORT TO BUY IT
AND COME BACK TO GET YOU WITH IT!" "wtf!!?"

If you want to make whopping tons of cash as a druid, tour areas
where people sell bone chips/spiderling silks/spider silks such
as inns in the commons. You can make 200 plat or more afk in the
bazaar at night just with what you find on some vendors in passing.
The profit margin is rather huge:

NPC...................................In Bazaar

Bone chip 1.4 silver.............2 gold or more
Spidering silk 5 silver..........2 plat or more
Spider silk 1.4 gold..............3 plat or more
