oh my god i didn't just read it, did i? to who ever wrote. you should
burn in hell you reises pig, you don't live in isreal do you? wall i
do, and i don't see them just as guests i see them as half broters of
mine, they are fighting for what they believe in, true it may not be
the right way. but that's what they were teached as kids.

i have an idea, indted of spaming them way won't you try and be
friendly to them, get to know them. not all of them want a war, most
of them just want to live in peace. so way won't you shot your mouth.
