Thanks for the suggestions.  I appreciate it a bunch.

Popped into the local Borders and for the books I could find (not a huge
selection .. I was somewhat disappointed) I looked the copyright dates until
I came across the oldest, which was "Measure of a Hero" by Blaine Lee
Pardoe.  I was thinking that in the case of such a long series, the further
back I could go, the better.

There were also a few (very few) MechWarrior books.  They seemed to be a
more recent development.

I'll look for the Stackpole next.  From the looks of things, I may have to
hit Amazon for them.  I'm planning on looking through the stacks at the
local used book store, too.
