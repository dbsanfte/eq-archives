However, in EQ2 that is precisely their goal, priest classes all being 
just as effective at healing, tanks all just as effective at tanking, 
etc. They're under the mistaken impression that merely offering 
different ways of doing the exact same thing is all that is needed to 
achieve an effective and desirable class balance.

The way I see it, possibilities for class variance (identity) fall 
between two extremes. 

One extreme involves many diverse classes, each having specific, 
identifying skills and abilities. Naturally, there would be some 
overlap, but it would be true to the nature of the class. The cleric, 
for example, would be the healer par excellence with the ability to call 
upon the favor of their gods to imbue/protect those around them. Healing 
and protecting would be their game. Shaman, on the other hand, would be 
designed around communing with the spirit world and the use of various 
spells/potions to cause detrimental effects on the enemy as well as 
boost the effectiveness of allies. Whereas it only makes sense for a 
shaman, true to the medicine man image, to be able to heal, they should 
not be able to work the miracles of healing that the cleric can perform.

The other extreme involves only a few classes that cover the basic roles 
of gameplay, tanking, healing, DPS, crowd control and possibly 
buffing/debuffing. For example, warriors might be the only tank class, 
clerics the only healers, wizards the only high-damage class, enchanters 
the only CC class and shaman the only buffer/debuffer class. Any utility 
skills and abilities would be divided among them.

I see the first extreme as the holy grail of MMORPG's. The first company 
to successfully pull it off will be the next EQ though some may argue 
that WoW is already worthy of that title by sheer subscription numbers. 
EQ, nonetheless, has come the closest to that extreme of any. I agree, 
however, that CH and their complete mishandling of slow have proved to 
be their nemesis.

EQ2 leans much more toward the second extreme, but fails to pull it off. 
Players sacrifice the texture and identity of what their classes could 
be, yet still don't enjoy the balance that design philosophy should 
provide. SoE has tried to make each of the sub-classes within an 
archetype interesting and viable on its own. Unfortunately, it felt to 
me like little more than window dressing. Clerics aren't primarily 
clerics any more then shaman are primarily shaman. They are both priests 
first and foremost, seeming more dilluted than different. 

Though the numbers and stats are evident everywhere you look in a 
MMORPG, I feel they should rank second in priority behind making the 
class interesting where class design is concerned.
