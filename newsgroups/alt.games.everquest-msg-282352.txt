I don't like that either, and of course there are legal, illegal, and
semi-legal ways to avoid registration.  Note, that I said I THOUGHT
that 98 support had been discontinued.  Aparently I was mistaken.  It
happens, but I wasn't spreading misinformation.  Further, expect 98
support to drop "Real soon now"TM.  If you want MOST of the support and
none of the hassle, windows 2000 can be made to play like windows XP
90%+ of the time. with appropriate patching.
