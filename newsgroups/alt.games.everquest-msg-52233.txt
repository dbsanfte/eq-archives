The problem is that you have to make a couple of assumptions.

Namely, is the player a total fuckwit or someone with more than a pair
of braincells to rub together?

If the former, stick with a druid anything more complicated than
snare, run, nuke is gonna fuck them up.

If the latter, necro.  Nothing compares to the rate at which you'll
solo.  I'm not talking about 'close'.  I'm talking about HUGE freaking
gaping difference in rate of kills.

I remember when I was soloing my druid in BW, even squeezing out the
maximum damage possible per point of mana I couldn't compete with a
guild necro 4 levels below me.

Unless you're a meleer, twinking will have relatively little impact on
soloability at higher levels.
