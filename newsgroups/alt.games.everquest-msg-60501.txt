"Totoro101" has got a point - you just don't see it....
Please don't think that there is a plainly visible barrier
at which someone takes too much of your personal
freedom, and before doesn't.
Your freedom will be taken from you bit by bit.
Well - information of yourself will be.
To answer your question: No, that does not hurt anyone
in the least - UNLESS someone starts abusing that
information against you...

It's hard to tell when that point is reached, but anyways,
I am not willing to share personal information about
myself neither.
If my opinion about gameplay and/or changes in it is needed,
I will gladly help them out, but NOT at the price of
giving away individual information about myself or
my puter.

As for you saying they could easily find that out by themselves:
If they had the eqclient spy on your system specs and submit
them to their servers, that would be a massive criminal attack
against every users personal freedom, and the responsible Verant
staff would very soon either land in jail or have be fined
horrendous sums...


Best Regards,
