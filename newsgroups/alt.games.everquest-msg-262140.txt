It's trivial to do if the mob is snared, it's easy to do if the mob is 
not snared.  As a shaman, I have at my disposal, a really high agro 
spell, slow, as well as a variety of DoTs that are also high agro, and 
generate additional agro every tick that they are doing damage.  What I 
do lack is snare, so I cannot slow the mob down when I agro kite, 
instead, I have to rely on getting maximum distance, and casting quickly.  
Often, this does mean I get pounded a few times, but fortunately, the mob 
is generally already slowed, and I can take a bit of a few hits from most 
any mob I'd be doing this to.  Necros are superb at this, they have 
snare, and DoTs to generate a lot of agro.
