Hmmm...I never thought of it this way.  Enchanters being begged to
cast KEI, druids/wizards being begged to leave groups for
ports....things that happen less frequently because of game changes in
the past year.

This makes me wonder if/when we'll see a rez nerf.  I'm not suggesting
that it's a good idea, but clerics are often still begged regularly
for rezzes, such that most of the 56 or higher clerics on The Nameless
run around /anon or /role, unless their guilds require that they be
fully "visible" or they're in a hard-to-reach zone.

A rez is really just a port with an experience regain.  Makes me
wonder if we'll see level restrictions on rezzes soon.....my guess is
that the likelihood of that is inversely proportional to the
difficulty of coding it. :)

Just speculating...
