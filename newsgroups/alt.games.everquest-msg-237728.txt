Theres a common thought experiment that has uses synthetic neurons... 

You start by suppose the existence of a synthetic neuron, a device
that works just like a regular biological one, and interfaces with
them without any issues.

And then you take a functioning normal human brain... one that is
obviously conscious.

And then replace a single biological neuron with a synthetic one. By
definition of the problem the brain won't know the difference the new
neuron will behave exactly as the old one did.

Obviously its still a conscious human mind.

Then we replace another one... and we ask ourselves... is it still a
conscious human mind... and we repeat it, one neuron at a time...

And there are 2 general outcomes: (and a few unlikely exotic ones)
1) That the mind will gradually lose consciousness as neurons are
replaced. (not necessarily on a linear scale, but in some proportion
to the amount of sythetic replacement.

or 
2) That the mind will continue to function as before, unaware that it
was ever rebuilt.


Most people think the most logical result would be #2, which implies
AI can both exist and have all the properties of the human mind.
(will, intelligence, creativity...)
