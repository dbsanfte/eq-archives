I'm pretty sure max haste on an item is 41 percent, that list of all
haste things seems to kind of show that too.

I always thought that if a weapon said "HASTE" it was only on that
weapon. It makes sense that it would be both when it was a proc but if
not a proc I thought it was only on the weapon.

I'd concur and say its better to have weapons that appear better and
to get a seperate haste item such as a belt or something.
