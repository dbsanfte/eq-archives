[Well, since it isn't actually gonna happen, here's the secret agenda:]

But that's the point!  The true genius of <my> suggestion is that it
would provide substantial relief from overcrowding in some hunting
zones by luring all those poor mall-addict-types into a never ending
cycle of bazaar shopping.  They could never be sure that the bargain
they're looking for (or even better the "awesome bargain" they were
<not> looking for!) isn't at the bazaar they haven't been to for a
couple hours while they checked out the other four.  muahahahaha!
