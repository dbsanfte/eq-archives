Why don't you know their real names!?

If people want you to treat them like people they need to transcend 
their anonymous eq personas.

Its hard enough treating RL friends fairly with EQ friends... but if 
your eq friends are faceless and nameless people who you only interact 
with through the facade of a pixelated woodelf named Roxy... ... they're 
not really friends at all...
