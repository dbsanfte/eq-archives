No, you snipped the qualifying part of my statement.

Taken out of context you use my words to paint me into being an "exp
grinder" (with your "telling" remark) and apply such motives to my
support of the faster travel system.

"Numerical" was put into quotes for a reason. Almost every aspect of
EQ rewards players through numerics. Even the number of friends you
make or the people you meet is a measure that can be taken. How do you
measure your personal "progress" durring your gaming session? What
types of in-game experiences satisfy you and make it all worth while?
No matter how you slice it, anything that is rewarding in-game can be
boiled down to a "numerical" achievement. Even crossing 10 zones on
foot in defiance of the new portal systems.

Liking and using the PoK/Nexus port system does NOT mean that a player
is only interested in grinding exp, or that said player has no
interest in roleplaying or exploring the depth of the game content.

You are painting your position with too broad a stroke.
