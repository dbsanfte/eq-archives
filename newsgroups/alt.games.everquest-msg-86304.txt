/agree Dan Harmon

Even before the "official" announcement, my belief (based on in-game
experience and reading way too many news groups/message boards at
work) was that charisma helps a little if you're mezzing/charming very
high blues, even-cons, yellows or reds.

Hopefully you're not fighting high-cons in your XP groups, so consider
maybe tossing on a little extra cha gear for raids.  If it doesn't
seem to help, switch back to the HP/AC gear to give the cleric a bit
more time to heal you.

As a phantasmist, any mez/charm spell that will work on something that
fits that category is nearly unresistable anyway, so I've stopped
worrying about charisma altogether.  If I'm trying to keep a
perma-charm, I'll throw on the charisma buff just on the off chance
that it might help, and probably won't hurt.   I also drink chicken
soup when I get a cold for the same reasons. :-)

For a level 45, I would reccomend INT/HP/Mana/AC/CHA in that order.
