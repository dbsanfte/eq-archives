Qeynos.  It has less hunting options than many other starting locations, but
has almost no beggars.  It is near Everfrost and Blackburrow, so it is
possible to do well enough there.  But mainly for me, it's that I started my
main there so long ago, and when my travels take me out that way, I really
do get a sense of going home again.  Strange to get that feeling in a game,
but there it is.
