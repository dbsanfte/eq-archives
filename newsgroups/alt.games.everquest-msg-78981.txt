    First, the useful and relevant part of Bizbee's response:

    He points out Dan's assumptions (that a guide can't do a thing remotely,
that a guide babysitting an NPC can't leave the NPC for any reason) as
flawed, which they likely are. Here are the useless parts of Bizbee's post,
taken out of order but not out of context:

    Bizbee, let's be blunt. When Dan did the post that got him thrown into
your killfile, he was 100% correct about you. You WERE an arse to anyone
that came here asking a question that you thought to be remotely redundant
and/or frivolous. You DID fly off the handle at folks in ways that had to be
seen to be believed. And Dan's backup for all of his points, delivered in
his trademark thorough style (when he gets a bee in his bonnet he GOES), was
spot-on. He made you look like a complete lunatic, the way you raved at him
and even followed up your own posts to rave some more.

    And then you changed.

    I've watched. You haven't bitten the head off a newcomer that hasn't
been trolling ever since that thread. You increased the amount of useful
information you give out, not by much (you gave out a fair amount before so
large increases couldn't be expected), but by a noticeable amount. You're
still sarcastic in the extreme, but this IS a Verant game we're talking
about - it's understood. :-)  There's just one thing you've been unable to
give up, one thing that you still do, day in and day out (no pun intended):

    You snipe at Dan Day from behind your killfile, still pissed off that he
embarassed you so badly.

    Bizbee, give it up.

    Dan's post *made you a better person in this newsgroup*. He's shown you
NO malice since then except when you peek from behind the killfile to take
more pot shots. And unless you want to create a Dan-style post showing
otherwise, I contend that his other contributions to the newsgroup (swim
testing, how to hang out with Grandmaster Glok in Cabilis, and others) have
more than proved his value here. Take Dan OUT of the killfile, get rid of
the hostility towards him, and just move on. Please.

    And if you can't - if you're so convinced he was totally wrong, he does
nothing useful, he still attacks you in every other post he makes that you
can't stop your behaviour towards him - then throw me in there, too. Because
I'd be proud to be put in the same category as him.

    James
