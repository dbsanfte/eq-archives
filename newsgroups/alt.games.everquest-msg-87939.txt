    Which would be no different than last Olympics in Lillehammer, when the
Canadian ice dancing pair got screwed off the podium by, wait for it, bloc
voting by judges. Only in dance it isn't entirely obvious when someone has
been screwed, whereas in pairs it's pretty obvious when someone stumbles and
someone doesn't. Yes, we Canadians have had bad judge issues as far back as
you can look, sigh....
