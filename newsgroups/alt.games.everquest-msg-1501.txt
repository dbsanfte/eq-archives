Don't bother going elsewhere, there's going to be jerks throughout Norrath.

Here's a suggestion/clue:  get a thick skin.  EQ is EASY compared to
newsgroups and anyone is liable to get their ass handed to them here.  If
you can't simply stick assholes on /ignore in EQ you probably shouldn't be
posting in this newsgroup. :)

Everyone makes mistakes, even my Gnome God (49 enchanter).  People die
because of my mistakes.  Shit happens...apologize ONCE (ONCE, DAMNIT, JUST
ONCE) and get on with your life.

It's part of Christian doctrine somewhere that when you screw up it's your
duty to apologize sincerely.  IT IS NOT your job to get the person to
FORGIVE you.  That's THEIR problem.  I'm not a bible thumper...that's just
something that I read somewhere and it made a big impression on me because
it makes a lot of sense.  You are not responsible for other people's mental
illness.
