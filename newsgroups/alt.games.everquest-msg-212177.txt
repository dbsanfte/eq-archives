You are committing a logical fallacy.  Observing that religious
faith and closed-mindedness can be seen to coincide in some people
does not in any way show a causal relationship.  Your statement
makes no more sense than the claim that AIDS is "God's judgement"
on homosexuals.  In fact, the anti-religious bigotry you express
is in no significant way different from any other sort of bigotry.
