SK have Harm Touch, Paladins have Lay on Hands, Rangers have Track 
(which seems to me a fantastic ability in PvP, much better than "well 
he's in this zone somewhere"), and beastlords have... well ok, nothing 
comes to mind pre 9th.  Beastlords should get a pet from 1st level on, 
in order to fit in with the other hybrids.

Personally, I doubt I'll ever get a character past 6th level on 
Discord... but something makes me keep trying, heck, for a while I 
dispaired of ever getting one -to- 6th level!

Fun trying though, I've always liked the low end game, and this server 
gives me the perfect excuse for starting over again and again.

Splendid
