Oh man, my sides hurt!!  You have no idea what I am talking about but
dang your post is funny as all heck.  My group letting me get aggroed? 
A better group?  Oh geez it hurts.  

If you've heard me speak of my little gang you would know that we boldly
go where we can't, do the impossible regularly and yes, as shocking as
it may seem, sometimes my cleric gets hit hehe.  We have neither
enchanter nor bard so CC requires a fair amount of creativity. 
Strangers who join us are often amazed at what we can do, I rather doubt
I could find a better group w/o adding some GMs heh.

I do agree with you on the resists of course though, but that is for
