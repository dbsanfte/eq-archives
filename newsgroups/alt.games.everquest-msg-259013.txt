There is a solution to this: have a higher level necromancer do the combine
for you.  I've done it before for lower level necromancers, generally for
free if they have the words.  Takes me two seconds.  Go run to PoK or some
high traffic area and do a /who necro (or /who necro lfg), and ask them if
they can combine some words for you really quick.  Words aren't generally
all that expensive except for the rare ones or GoD drops.
