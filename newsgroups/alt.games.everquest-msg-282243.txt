I've always thought having forage as a racial skill was dumb, because it 
is a skill that, in real life, any human can easily learn.  So, what is 
it about foraging in Norrath that makes it so some races can do it and 
some cannot?

In general, anything that a typical Earth boy scout would have no 
trouble learning should be available to everyone in Norrath, if it is 
available at all.  A level 1 character in EQ has presumably been 
training for years to be ready to go out into the dangerous world on 
their own, and would have picked up all the basic outdoorsmen skills, 
regardless of their race and class.

I got email from Sony a week or two ago, telling me that they've 
reactivated my account for 21 daya.  Looks like they are trying to lure 
people back.  So I copied EQ back from my backup drive, launched it, 
patched (took about 30 minutes), and did a little running around.  
Killed a couple greens.  Sat down to get mana back.

Wow!  Compared to the other MMORPGs I play or have played (DAoC, CoH, 
WoW, EQ2), the downtime in EQ was just amazingly long.  They definitely 
need to do something about this, if they want to attract and keep new 
players.

(Looks like there's been some nerfage since I last played.  My Staff of 
Temperate Flux has a recast time of 12 seconds now, and it says my 
Fishbone Earring requires a fish scale.  It used to be an effect, not a 
spell, so was always on and required no component).

I wonder when they changed this?  The way it used to work is that they 
were not independent events.  When you fizzled, it increased the 
probability that the next spell would fizzle.  This was *proven* when a 
statistician set up a macro to cast a spell repeatedly, and then 
analyzed the resultant 25000 casts.  He also analyzed the random number 
generator via /random, and found that it was fair.

Here were the results:

   Overall chance of fizzle: 6%
   Chance of 2nd fizzle given 1 fizzle: 20%
   Chance of 3rd fizzle given 2 fizzles: 41%
   Chance of 4th fizzle given 3 fizzles: 53%
   Chance of 5th fizzle given 4 fizzles: 61%
