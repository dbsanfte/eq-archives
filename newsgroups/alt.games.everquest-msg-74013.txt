i do think guild halls with build in armory and bank would be nice tho....a
much better idea then 2000 people planting house all over the zone lag fest
like UO...and have like 10-20 guild with halls that cost upkeep to maintain
along with a large amount of plat to require...maybe even variing degree of
what the hall could look like custom looks ect...to give each guild a unique
look..
