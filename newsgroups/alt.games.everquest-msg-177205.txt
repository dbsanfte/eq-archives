FOR SALE:

This is a Character I have worked on since the beggining of Everquest.
He has a wonderful rep on bertox, and has not been played since the
release of POP so it would be really easy to pick right up and find a
place fit in.
I dont have any pictures atm, but his stats are as follows. 
2000hp 110str 164sta 140agi 178dex 255intell 105 cha 
30AA points 
He has a huge mana pool full TOV gear items or better, his epic, a
mixture of FT items, jboots, guise of the deciver (changes him into a
darkelf).
There is about 60 000pp in his bank and lots of good quest items. 
Also on the acount there is a 50 rogue with jboots. 
A lvl 30 Paladin with VERY nice items about 150,000 to 200 000pp in
gear, and Jboots.
There is a few other characters on the acount from lvl 16 - 30 with an
odd mixture of items and gear, and also a mule in the Bazzar with lots
of items to sell.

Disclaimer: The person buying my accounts, is buying my personal time,
that I have spent developing my characters, on these accounts. The
person buying my accounts is not buying any intellectual property of
Verant, Inc. or Sony Interactive. The purpose of this auction is to
transact the time I have spent developing my characters, to another
person so that they may continue to develop, play, and enjoy the
characters on these accounts. If you are a member of the Station
Network, Verant Inc., Sony Interactive Inc., eBay, or any of their
affiliated companies, you are not allowed to purchase these accounts.
Due to Verant's strict policies of not selling accounts or in-game
items, my characters will not be shown in the game until full payment
has been received. I do Not accept Paypal, personal checks, or
business checks. I have been advised by paypal staff not to accept
paypal, because paypal does not cover or insure auction transactions
that are essentially informational, such as this one, where the buying
and selling of account information is taking place; nor does paypal
cover or would be able to check account login/password information
transfer, once given. I have also been advised, that paypal also does
not cover auctions that are specifically time invested, such as this
one, were what is being purchased is the time it has taken to develop
the characters on these accounts. Buy-out offers will be taken and are
strongly encouraged. Thank you for taking the time to view my auction.

Terms of Sale: 
I would like someone who is willing to carry on and enjoy playing
everquest as much as I have in the past. I would still be playing now
if I could balance EQ with college but the time has come to prioritize
a bit more. I will assist in any help, information or guidance the new
owner may need in playing these characters. I also would be willing to
ship the original cds to the new owner, if they want them.
The account login name and password information will be sent
immediately over email, once full payment has been received. The cds
will be mailed the day after payment has been received.
If you have any questions or worrys please feel free to contact me at.

I will certainly entertain buyout offters and will reply to any emails
recived as soon as posible.
Thanks
