Yes, but some are impossible to raise from a "diss" point. The only
one really impossible to raise is halvling cleric guild if they diss
you when you try to train. You need to be indiff or something to do
the one quest that raises them (some hide quest) If wolf form still
makes you indiff there a druid could help you (group wolf) but it may
be kos in that area now.

You can raise qeynos clerics and paladins easily, bone chips to lashun
novashire, pally guild 6 bone chips in a box quest (great way to raise
with man bone chips), bandit sashes, rabid wolf and grizzly hides,
etc. You can then train there and also from that cleric lady on their
faction who is in one of the first huts in East commons (yeah, far
away from qeynos and convenient for my dark elf after she raised that
qeynos faction)

Dismal rage in the east freep sewers has a trainer and was only glower
by default to my dwarf pally of brell (so you are probably similar)
You give bone chips to xelha (necro in red) to up dismal rage. It
lowers the nfp pally guild, but not by very much so its not a big
issue even with tons of bone chips, especially if you kill pawns or
orcs sometimes. The trainer guy is by xelha Everyone else down there
is on dismal rage in that area, but if you go farther up and to the
left (past some vendors), into a room then into another room, the evil
opal dark briar and a neriak faction dark elf cleric are in there.

Thurg in velious is apprehensive and lucky for you trains clerics. I
don't remember if they trained at apprehensive.. I think not though
since my dark elf cleric raised faction there for some reason (killing
drakkel doggies outside.) A VERY good faction raise is to buy giant
heads from players or as a last resort off vendors in thurg for 90
plat or so. Sounds like a lot but if you give 4 heads to the
chancellor guy to the left of the dains throne by him, you get a LARGE
faction raise to dwarves there. My dark elf got to amiable pretty fast
that way.

Paineel trains clerics but even took my dark elf lots of kobold
killing to get to amiable and she has less to do than a good race.

Don't remember if a cleric trainer is around the shadow haven area.

Neriak cleric faction can't be raised I don't think from a non indiff
point, not that you'd be able to enter the city anway.

North freep clerics guild was even raiseable with my dark elf cleric.
She was still not that high with pallys, from killing orcs, but used
the one use halfling mask from the dark elf symbol quests to get to
the point where she could give Cloth Shirts to that wandering altunic
pally guy in east commons. She could only buy the shirts there with
that halvling form also since she was glower without it to the commons
vendors (no shirts sold in freeport, too bad because she is amiable
with vendors there and only small cloth shirts in neriak) They raise
both north freep clerics and pallys. I tried other various quests but
really it was simply the easiest to buy tons of shirts and give to
that guy, even with having to get another halvling form mask
sometimes. There are no mobs to kill that raise north freep clerics
that I know of.

So those are pretty much the ways to raise most cleric trainers,
though halfling may even be unraiseable to train for a dwarf cleric. I
know a dwarf cleric gets dissed there initially.
