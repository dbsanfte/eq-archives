Both the Argent and the arbitor's are a bit expensive.  Also, the 14 AC is
hard to turn down.

Hmm, one of our enchanters has a goal to see all the dungeons he missed
before he hit fifty... I may be able to drag him to Droga.

Next level, we're getting my soulfire, so I can mention that when go to take
out Xlott (or whatever his name is)

I guess I'll pick one up, and leave the other for the coldain ring quests.

Cool.  I'll look at the quests.

I've got the ro boot mold, but ran out of Melatite.  Given the fact that I
spent an entire day in Sol A, and didn't get anything, I doubt I'm likely to
pick another one up.

Very nice.  I'll have to see where they drop.

Aye, that's the problem.  When I told a friend that I was going to start
working on my Ro Quests, he said that the armor was junk, and I should be in
Deepwater by then... I was level 30.

Very much so.
