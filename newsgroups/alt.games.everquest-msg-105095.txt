Well its more fun to call it pink, when a male char is wearing it

Most of my guild refers to it as pink - but a lot of that is a basis to make
fun of whoever is wearing it :)

You said after the bp dropped, you guys go for it a lot now... do you guys
not have any ToV bp's?

We've killed RC a few times now and IIRC, 2 or 3 bp's went to out of guild
clerics, 1 to a guild cleric (the rest prefer their SS bp over it), and one
to a shaman (least i think he got it.. shaman wearable?)
