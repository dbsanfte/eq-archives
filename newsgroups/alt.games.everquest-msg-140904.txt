A Necro and just about any body else.

Why? Well a Necro is the best soloer period.
So anyone grouped with a necro will make a decent to excellent team.

So I think the question becomes who goes best with a necro?
That could be a huge debate. Let's see, here are the really
good combos that I can see:

Another Necro: With the new dot stacking coming this
will be a combo that's hard to beat.

Mage: Another excellent soloer. Mage can summon armor
and weapons for the pets. Can also summon focus items
for the Necro. Mage has nukes to take out enemy casters quick.
Necro has slow and fear to take out large many hit point
mobs. Mage also has damage shield for the mobs
you can't or don't want to fear. 2 hasted pets beating on a mob while
its feared and dotted with the mage throwing occasional nukes is a
combo to be seen. This duo could do reds and yellows most
of their careers and very big blues later on.

Cleric: Huge buffs for the pet, healing for the pet. Both
classes have powerful Spells against undead. If things
do go bad this is the best CR team there is. Healing
for the Necro so they can lich themselves silly.

Enchanter: Clarity (need I say more? heh ok) Another pet.
While the enchanter pet is fragile with the necro fearing
its not much of an issue. Some DoT stacking issues
but those are being improved even as we speak. Huge debuff
spells. Slow for the mob and haste for the pet. Enchanter
of course has excellent CC for those over-pulls and since
pets no longer break mez this is very nice. Enchanter has
many special use spells to cover many situations.

Druid: Good buffs for the pet, and a damage shield.
Regeneration, helps keep pet healed and lets the Necro
lich like mad. Dots to stack with the necros. Druid
is excellent puller outdoors, with tracking and SoW.
Like the Enchanter the druid has many special use spells
to cover many situations. Teleports to get to town and
back quickly, also to get to a new hunting spot if your
favorite one is over-camped.
