Keep stuffing yourself until you can't eat anymore.  Do this periodically.

Not that I know of.  I grab the stack of food, put it in instead of a bag,
right click, then swap the bag back in, and drop the food into inventory.

I would recommend just getting a stack of MTPs, and of the Qeynos Tea

RL month, depending on how much you play of course.
