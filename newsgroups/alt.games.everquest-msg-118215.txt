1.  Kiting occurs with those classes that can snare (slow the running 
speed of a MOB) and cast ranged spell damage.  They run around like they 
are dragging a kite.  More effective if they have the ability to run 
faster themselves, such as Spirit of Wolf.

2.  Quadding is Kiting with 4 MOBs.  Wizards and other classes that get 
area of effect spells capable of striking 4 MOBS, can quad-kite.

3.  Many of the higher levels of the game require a group of characters 
to solve.  Thus, one purpose of a guild is to bring together like minded 
people that play at similar times for grouping.  Guilds can also serve as 
a social grouping for more casual gaming.  There is more to guilds that 
I'm sure someone will follow on with.

4.  PC porting is done by druids and wizards to transport players from 
one location in Norrath to another, quickly.  Standard price ranges from 
10pp (Antonica to Antonica locations) to 50pp+.  Bear in mind that 
porting means downtime for the porter and takes away from gameplay.  
Beware of druids in Firiona Vie....I had one cast Group Wolf Form instead 
of prting and the FV inhabitants *hate* wolves :^)

    With the advent of Luclin, players can use the Wizard Spires to move 
their character to Luclin and back to one of 5 locations (NK, Toxx, GFay, 
Dreadlands, or GreatDivide(?).  Also note that porting from most places 
in Lucin to Norrrath do not work as intended.

5.  No reason not to go.  Try Paludial Caverns out (may want to be lvl 20 
though).

6.  Velious is a mid to high end set of zones that spreads out the player 
base across more zones and servers.  You get more storyline, different 
MOBs, more loot, more ways to improve tradeskills, and so on.

7.  Runes are research components.  Wizards get most spells but starting 
with level 16,I think, they have to research one or more of their spells 
each spell level.  Check out www.graffe.com (?) or eq.castersrealm.com 
for more info on the wizard class and spell research.
