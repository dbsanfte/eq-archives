You ever parsed a druid's damage who is main healer in a group?  Ever parsed
a hammer-proccing cleric?  You should.

You're a freak...  let's welcome back the days of the *true* zerg.  I
watched a guild kill Tormax once where every single melee was rezzed at
least three times.  You obviously desire to make this a better tactic so it
will be seen as valid.

Ya know, if you want to zerg so bad, there are guilds out there that will
accomodate your "style".  :P

As far as any relevance to LDoN...  stop being such a pussy and dial it up
to hard.  Then complain about clerics being useless.  :P
