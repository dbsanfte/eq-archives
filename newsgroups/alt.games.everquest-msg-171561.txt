    The ripe old age of 17, huh? So you know about (to compare with my 39
enchanter) damage shields, chain-stunning, what stats an ENC can effectively
buff (CHA/WIS/INT/STR with rune component) and when, an enchanter's
superlative ability to strip buffs and how it interacts with debuffs, aggro
buffing, mana draining, and the change in effectiveness in all of these
things and the things you experienced as an enchanter levels? Some of these
functions are so specialized (like mana draining) that people can go to
level 65 and never see an enchanter do it.

    You have to prove they're morons beyond just that. If a group adds a
bard, why do they want them there? Is it for haste song, for resists, for
ATK buffs, for damage shields, for regen, for mana song, for snare (to name
a few possibilities)? Once the group has determined their needs (and that's
assuming they do - not all do), why would they put up with a player that
doesn't fill that need even though he could?

    Long time ago I was in Velk's, with an average group with no mana
acceleration or slowdown. So the group recruited a shaman, for slows and
haste - the two biggest things a shaman could possibly contribute to that
group. The one we got was a retard that cast every useless stat buff in the
world, then meleed with his pet. When asked why he wasn't slowing, he told
us that the mobs could resist it and that was a lot of mana to waste on no
effect.

    Guess what we told him? "STFU and start slowing." Sometimes a player
needs to be reminded why they're there, especially when they get to the
level when they should know better.

    You mean like assuming that anyone who says "STFU and play manasong"
doesn't know all the wonderful things a bard can bring to a group?

    I'm a cleric, the class stripped of most utility. What little utility we
did have (STR line, Lull line, Yaulp line, PBAoE line, Fear line) was either
nerfed into uselessness, or was clearly useless in normal situations (Fear
indoors, PBAoE without stunners, etc.) It wasn't hard. =/ Of all the
casters, I'd say cleric is the easiest to learn to play.

    You mean, did I heal and buff because clerics are expected to heal and
buff? Yes. I'd be a very poor cleric if I didn't do those things. If I can
squeeze other things in, great - but they'd better never come at the expense
of healing and buffing.

> Are you arguing with me just for the sake of arguing?

    Hardly. You seem to think that if a player is told what to do, in any
way, that it's because the person telling them is a moron. It can never be
that the person being told doesn't know how his class could best help the
group, or doesn't know his own class, or doesn't know his elbow from his
ass, oh no! Those people aren't clueless, they're on voyages of
self-discovery!

    It's one thing to say "the average level of knowledge in EQ about game
mechanics is relatively low" - that can be supported, and is reasonable
given the sheer volume of information out there. But leaping from that to
"all people that say 'stfu and play manasong' are ignorant about game
mechanics" can't be supported.
