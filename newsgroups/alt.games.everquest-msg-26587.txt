Apologies if I've already posted something similar.  I truly cannot 
remember if I posted the previous attempt or not.

See:

If the Evil Alliance is supposed to be so overpowerful as they claim, then 
why are they getting spanked by the Neutral Alliance, much less the Newts 
and the Goods combined?  The answer: half the Evils are bluebies who don't 
know they're on a pvp server (or at least play like they don't know it).

who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no

Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
