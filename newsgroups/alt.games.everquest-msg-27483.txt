The downside is that you get *so* used to not really fearing death, that
you lose your normal cautionary nature and "safe play" self-imposed
rules.  Example:  Last night my partner (the cleric) was out of town IRL,
and I decided to spend some of that time in the commonlands working on my
Knights of Truth faction, killing orc pawns, and later on, militia
guards.  Just me and a wizard from my guild. No healer.
  It was a little while later when I told her I was going to pull Sgt.
Slate to the WC zone so we could try fighting him there.  I was about 2/3
of the way into a thirty second battle that was going decidedly Slate's
way, and running out of health fast, when I realized something.........
I'M FUCKING BOUND IN THURGADIN!!!!!!!!!
Zone.
(Man, I hope the wizard makes it out ok or she's gonna be pissed.)
