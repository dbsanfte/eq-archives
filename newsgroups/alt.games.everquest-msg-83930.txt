Given the quality of most American voice actors... I'll just stick with
reading the dialoug boxes.  At least my ears won't start bleeding.  Leave
the japanese speech in, if you want, though.  Just don't make me listen to
rightfully unemployed actors slaughtering the script.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
