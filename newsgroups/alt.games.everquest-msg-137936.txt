There is a lot of interesting stuff about how it might be possible with
AM3+EQ+DISC using Primal Bows and Mithril arrows, but as for the actual
event the last post on the link above says:

"One of the Dark Horizon guild came on and said it was a BS post. Their
Rangers didn't do it. Thought about it but decided... "Hell No""

.. and several other posts from those named on other forums back this up.

Incidentally 300DPS from a Ranger with AM3+EQ+DISC+Primal+Mithril is widely
accepted ...
