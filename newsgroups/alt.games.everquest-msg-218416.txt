Actually I accounted for that. If two bards are grouped, but swarming at 
opposite ends of the zone, I'm assumed that each one will simply xp as 
if he was entirely by himself (each xps off his own, kills, w/ no 
bonus), This isn't better than soloing... but its not worse.

Where it gets 'better' (and only marginally), is when either has a 
couple minutes of downtime, and group regens, or when things go bad... 
its always good to have backup on call...
