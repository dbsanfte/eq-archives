I can remember some people commenting on necros and how they are soloing 
machines but often end up playing mana battery (I believe the term was 
"twitch bitch"?).

Is this still the case, or are necros more useful to groups than that 
overall. I'm talking about all levels here.

Similar question for mages, except are they very good soloers during most 
levels? Seems I heard in the high end raiding, they are often used 
primarily for the CoH spell, but pets aren't welcome in many instances.

You guessed it. I'm considering rolling up a pet class caster, maybe on 
Test.
