> What is the effect of having the "combine" skill?

Like people have said, I'll summarize here.

Combine is a language.  There's no use for languages anymore in the game.
It used to be that for INT casters (nec, mag, enc, wiz) to get some of their
spells they had to be able to read foreign languages to figure out how to
Research them.  With all the EQ sites now TELLING you how to do Research,
language skill is now PRACTICALLY worthless, though a lot of people like to
learn them for the hell of it and I guess you could use it sort of like
encryption if you wanted to talk about someone behind their back. :)
