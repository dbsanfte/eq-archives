I was running along in Nektulos, about to zone into Neriak, when
suddenly a loud tone started coming from my speakers.  It sounded like
a square wave through a low pass filter...it was quite annoying.

It stayed that way while I did various things in Neriak, and only
stopped when I logged out.  Sound was then fine for normal system
stuff and other games.  Next time I started EQ, when it would have
started playing the music while it loads, the horrible sound started,
and stayed there until I logged out.

I've made no system changes between the time it last worked and now.

I'm running WinXP with a SoundBlaster Live.

Anyone else see this problem?
