It was mentioned to do the "Exotic Drinks" quest.  This is a must and a
money maker so you can upgrade your silk armor.  They sell for around 200pp
on Karana.  I try to always have:

1) 1 Stein
2) 1 Bartenders Compendium ( you turn this in for the Stein  - is No-Drop /
Lore)
3) 1 Erud's tonic, 1 Honey Jum, 1 Koalindl fish, and some Kiola nuts ( the
first 3 are No-Drop / Lore, and I hope I gave the correct names )

When someone buys the stein, I run to Ogguk and turn in the Compendium for
the stein.  Then I turn in the 4 ingredients for the book.  Then I start
collecting the Tonic, Jum, and fish ( already have the kiola nuts ) as I
wander around the world.  I usually get a port to Tox, run into Erudin to
get the tonic, take the boat to Qeynos and get a fish ( using one of the
normal methods ), and then get a port back to Western Commons and run to
Rivervale.  You can do it much faster if you can get ports ( and SoWs ) to
Tox, then NK, then Misty ( I think you can get a port there, never tried ).

Make friend with a druid who is 29 or above, and give them a stein for one
of their new characters, and then you will have future ports anytime you
need them.  There's a gal on my server that ports me anytime I really ask
her because I gave her a stein.  We met in Oasis when I was level 17 and she
was lvl 24 and constantly traded breezes and SoWs.  That friendship has paid
off, now.

When I'm not playing my chanter, I'm usually playing my warrior around EC /
WC and when someone auctions they want a stein, I send them a quick tell
saying "I have a stein for 200pp".  They say ok, and I log in the chanter.
It's a quick 200pp, and you just can't beat that.

Good luck, and post here if you have any specific questions about the quest.
