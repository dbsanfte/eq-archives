Yeah but what level people?  They announced that getting to 10 would be
ridiculously easy, and getting to 30 would be ridiculously easy if you spent
your time in dungeons.

BTW, with minor PLing it takes 4 kills per level to get to level 4 (1.5
yellows per kill if the critter is yellow or low red...1.5 yellows seems to
be the max now, instead of .5 yellow) and I suspect it's the same all the
way to 10.  Soooo, 40 low reds and you're level 10...pretty sweet, eh
(sarcasm)?
