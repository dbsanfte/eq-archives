They're either a pet or pet assisted class. Giving them anything close
to warrior abilities along with a substantial, enhanceable pet would
surely be monstrous.

eq.castersrealm.com has a list of the `expected' spells. It basically looked
to me like they get the best bits of the shaman buffs. In other words not the
questionably usefull stat buffs. They also don't have the same DoT power. On
the other hand lots of good looking pet enhancement spells. Of course how it
plays out in practice could be interesting.

Not sure what this means for my barb shaman. If there's a large number of
kitties, which seems likely, shamans and beastmasters would seem to make
the spell list pretty common. Especially since the Vah Shiar are pretty
restricted in caster choices.
