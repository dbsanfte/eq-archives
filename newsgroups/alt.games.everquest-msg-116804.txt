If you want 30pp for a port, why not announce you're porting for 30pp?

You get the amount you want. You don't waste time going to people who
aren't paying that much. They don't waste time 'insulting' you. You
don't get 'fucked out of the going price'.

You hoping people who want to pay less will feel pressured into paying
the 30pp when you're standing in front of them saying it's not enough?
Hoping people will pay you more than 30pp sometimes because you didn't
state a price? Or both?

If someone pays you 100pp in answer to a 'porting for donations' because
they're rich, do you return 70pp saying '30pp is the going rate', or is
that OK because they are richer than you. 'Going rate' only applies to
poor people?
