Quindell just reposted his "Everquest Links I Have Found Useful" today.
I highly suggest you go read that thread, print it, and start
bookmarking a bunch of those links in your browser. Including the newbie
guide and the pinkpig link for general everquest terms, etc.  You will
find this list of links to be of TREMENDOUS value and answer a bunch of
your questions. The more you're willing to research on your own, the
less you'll have to rely on asking questions here. (Which, of course,
you can still do if you can't find the info elsewhere.)
