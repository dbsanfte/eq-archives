Assuming there's a monk and bard in the group.  But the monk's DPS drops 
because his haste drops, and the mob's DPS goes up because he isn't 
slowed anymore.   This both prolongs the fight and creates a drain on 
healer mana... oh, but the mana regen and the hp regen that were helping 
with that situation have also run off with the bard.  Now if your group 
has two bards, I'll grant you that second bard is probably no great loss...

No, but he does have "spell haste" type haste songs, and since as I note 
below, its unlikely we have both a chanter and bard, thats the one I'm 
talking about.   If we do, well, as I mentioned there are myriad other 
spell combos he could be singing depending on group and situation, a 
good bard is usually noticable when his songs stop hitting you, whatever 
they were.

Time to pacify several mobs can be annoying, too, having used this 
method both as a bard and as a cleric.  It helps if you know the mobs 
well enough to predict their social aggro range and pathing, so you can 
pac as few as possible.  But I'll grant you the "overpull is no big 
deal" on most bard pulls, I said as much in my original post.

Indoors or out?  I have the impression that monks are the premier indoor 
pullers, particularly for loot purposes, while rangers shine outdoors. 
I can certainly say that I've met a couple of excellent outdoor pulling 
rangers in the past couple days, and the exp flows like water even in SF 
  where ordinarily there's a substantial delay between mobs just because 
they become hard to locate.

Thats exactly my point.  But there's no way of knowing at the moment 
what will be required to unlock Luclin, as Velious hasn't even been 
unlocked yet, and even when it is, little information will be released 
if Kunark has been any indicator.  We -think- the boss in VP is the 
remaining roadblock, but all we really know is that one more mob must 
die.  Could be Scruffy for all they're saying.

He's green.  He's been green since I was under 20, IIRC.  My current 
best pet is Malevolent Dead, which I got at level 52.  He was green at 
the time and of course still is.  If I'm pulling red to me, or even con 
to me, mobs, then there's no question, I can use my best.  But when the 
mobs are DB, I guess I'm not so sure, particularly next level when I 
finally get Cackling Bones.  I'd think the actual levels would be 
recorded somewhere, but I seem to be overlooking it if they are.

But still something I should learn to do well, even if its limited

I don't think so, at least not till above 60, which is as far as I've

Thats precisely my point, if I'm not MT, I'm probably contributing less 
to the group than any other class.  I might as well pull, particularly 
if pulling is going to mean going FD and getting a tag.  I know this, 
too, I can take a beating a lot better than most monks (unless they 
fixed the nerf which made this the case); its the one thing I'm really 
good at, after all.

Usually I don't care how much the snare slows the mob down; it moves 
slower than I do, thats fine, in fact when I'm trying to pull it to a 
given spot, I'd like as little snare as possible, so it doesn't take so 
long arriving (and also doesn't have as much time to have roamers path 
into its way).  The amount of damage they actually deliver is also 
negligable by the levels where I get them; 20 a tic and 8 a tic are both 
in the "so little damage I wish they did none at all, so I could snare a 
mob and then have the CC mez park it" category.  If I'm likely to have 
to fear kite, I load Dooming as well as Clinging, and use it on those 
targets, to some extent because it slows movement more, but mostly 
because it has a much longer duration.  If all I'm doing is fear kite I 
tend to load engulfing and dooming, because if I get a dooming resist I 
can cycle to engulfing instead of having to wait for dooming to repop.

For splitting purposes, it sounds like Dooming is again the pick, I'll 
have to try it out sometime soon, and assuming it works, get some 
practice in so I can work out the tricks of the trade.  I also have 
another tool I didn't when I last tried this, Harmshield.  Lacking a 
second FD, at least I can be immune to damage during the wait for FD to 
repop.

Speaking of Harmshield, it seems like an interesting tool for pulling 
hard core casters.  I haven't experiemented, really, but it appears on 
casual use to dump almost all aggro and prevent all damage and all 
spells from sticking to me; much like DA, only with a much shorter cycle 
time.  Pulling raid targets, the ranger is frequently ending up dead 
because something casts on him. (stun or root or even snare, the mob 
catches up to him and tears him apart, unslowed and away from healers) 
If I pull, especially with something which has a delay in it, like an 
arrow or a suicide pet, and cast harmshield, that would give me 18 
seconds to get the target back to the raid/group.  Of course I couldn't 
chain pull like that, with the five minute repop, but I could use it for 
hard targets.

Well I'm not experienced with this, but I can see how from your 
explaination dooming would work better; my problem was that by the time 
the add had reset the snared mob was already back over in social range 
of it.  Engulfing would be marginally better than clinging at this, but 
dooming would be twice as good... maybe more so.  Since mobs run while 
in combat, but walk when returning to their spots, perhaps at 60% 
movement penalty, they literally don't move at all?

Does it still count as direct aggro if I'm FD'd?  An easy experiment to 
arrange would be to fear a mob that will path thru some buddies, then 
FD, wait for him to get well past them, then stand up, see if they come 
for me.

I can tell you this, though, few chromodracs die in SF, if you had to 
pick a mob to be, this would be the one.  Chromodracs dispell buffs, and 
do so frequently, meaning you have two choices, fight buffless or 
replace buffs constantly.  Since buffs are a big force multiplier, and 
since Chromos don't drop anything particularly more valuable than the 
rest of the mobs in zone, they tend to be avoided.

As a side note, when I'm soloing, I love to pick on chromos, I don't 
have any buffs I really need anyway, and they are plentiful and there's 
no competition.  Thats assuming I don't have clarity potions, though, if 
I do, then they are burning thru my expensive and hard to find supplies!

I've found recently that I can look thru walls in normal gnome form, 
dunno about other races, but it seems to be a change from what I recall 
a few years back, when getting wolf form really helped a lot with that. 
  Wolf form can be cast on others though, as can SOW, those two don't 
really strike me as advantage Ranger.  I don't have harmo or bind sight 
or track, though, and what the ranger currently pulling for guild raids 
really has going for him is his skill set; he's good at using the tools 
he does have, the only real down side is that he dies a lot, which slows 
down pulls.  I'm hoping that if I can get skilled at using the tools I 
have at my disposal, perhaps I can substitute FD for his RD; thats time 
consuming too, but at least I don't have to be rebuffed once I do get 
back on my feet.

Thats a good point, I maxed out my bow skill and worked my fletching 
skill up to a bunch more than I actually need in order to make range 150 
arrows, but eventually I got to where the mana to cast pulling spells 
was negligable and for MT purposes, casting was vastly superior to 
arrows for grabbing aggro off the puller, I put the bow away in favor of 
a range slot item which gives me hp/stats.  To be a dedicated puller 
though, there are reasons an arrow works better in some circumstances, I 
need to get myself a good long range bow with stats if possible to 
replace that wurm totem with, or at least swap in when pulling.

At 110 fletching there's nothing really interesting to make, would it be 
worth getting up to 200 or so, or perhaps simpler just to find a ranger 
fletcher?
