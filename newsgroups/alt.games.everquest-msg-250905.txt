That was my thought also.  I think you'd need an macroing program to make
this work with the PLee going AFK. Either that or a character who step in
and immediately grab aggro from the PLee while doing mininal damage.  Maybe
it could work with a nice HP buff to the PLee and a healer.  You'd still be
left with another painful reality - when the pet does all the damage, the
PLee would only get 25% experience, really slowing things down.
