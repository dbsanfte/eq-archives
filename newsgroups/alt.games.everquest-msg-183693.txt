Well of the unique servers you have Firiona Vie, a roleplay preferred
server. You don't have to roleplay, but if you're interested in
getting into your character, then it's definitely a good place to
start.

The Zek servers (the ones marked PvP) aren't great servers for newbies
because of the Player Vs Player aspect...other servers you aren't in
danger of the human players taking a chunk out of you, just the
creatures.

I've found Fennin Ro to be quite good for communities, I was on there
and there was a lot of interaction going on with shouts and server
messages.
