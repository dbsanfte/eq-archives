EQ is a grouping game.  If _any_ class could solo beyond very low
level with constant action _and_ progression it would totally
destroy EQ as a grouping game.  I don't want to play "Several
Thousand Soloers Some of Whom Occasionally Gather to Destroy a
Dragon", and I'm damned happy that SOE has decided not to give
in to all you whining twitch addicts.  You want constant action
solo?  then go play a game that prvides that, EQ is NOT that
game, EQ has NEVER BEEN that game, EQ was NEVER INTENDED to be
that game.  And I, for one, like it that way very very much.
In other words, it is a GoodThing[tm] that soloing my Druid
gets boring, it means that SOE hasn't been conned into wrecking
the game yet.
