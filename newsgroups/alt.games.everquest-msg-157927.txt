Well thats it Ed, you have convinced me to spend the money  on PoP just 
to keep the circle of whining going.  I don't need raid channels and I 
wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money just on teleports since I have 
multiple druids, but if I can keep even one whiner whining then it will 
be money well spent, be it a druid whiner a druid whine whiner or a 
druid whine whiner whiner such as yourself.
