I have a question to pose for you fine folks.  I'm getting my
Wurmslayer thru the quest rather than buying, and have all the scales
now.  What I'm wondering is if there's a trick to getting Squire
Fuzzmin/Sir Hobble to pop in FV.  Everything I've read says they are
random spawns and can be found absolutely anywhere in the zone.  I say
come on, this is EQ.  There's ALWAYS a way, right guys???
