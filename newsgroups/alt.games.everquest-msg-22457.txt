I'm guessing he's the Priest of Life who often swims in the pool, I
can't remember the name. If you sit in the right spot, he doesn't aggro
you - basically you gank the fish when it's furthest from him and you're
out of his aggro range. They seem to follow two paths, straight up and
down the center of the pool, and from Enic to the left side of the pool
(as you face it coming in) and up and down that side. You can sit about
a third of the way into the pool on either fish-path and gank that
particular fish with impunity.
