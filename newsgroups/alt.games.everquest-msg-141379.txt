I have pickled drake in my first slot of my bag.  I have had 10 of these now
for months.  Heres the thing,  if you force feed yourself other food, ie
veggies, fruit, etc. you will still have the stat increase from the magic
food and it should never run out.  Especially if your a forager.  Everytime
I forage I eat whatever it is til I'm full that way I wont eat the drake.
Just thought ya may have wanted to know.
