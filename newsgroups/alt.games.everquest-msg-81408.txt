Dude, nice post and all that, but she meant "broke" in the sense of "not 
having any money"...

Traditionally, Clerics have been the most broke class... They had to buy 
spells, expensive reagents *and* plate armor. Nowadays it's not so bad, I 
believe, because people are better at donating for resurrections than in 
the old days, and compensating them for the reagent expenses.

Druids usually do well in later levels. Hanrahan is 36, totally 
untwinked, and is sitting at 204 WIS, which ain't bad at all for a 
low-wis Human.
