You sure you didn't have your song interrupted, or forget to equip your
drum?  I wanted to see the new sky, and then see sunrise in Oasis, and found
that when Sony reactivated cancelled accounts for the 5th anniversary, they
only reactivated accounts cancelled up to about 3 days before I cancelled
both of my accounts. :-/  My main was on monthly billing, and so the
cancellation took effect.  The secondary was on 6 month billing, and hasn't
reached the end of the billing cycle yet, so I had to use that.  I ran my
level 20 Druid through EC, and aggroed some skeletons, including some that
were blue to me.  After running away a while, I stopped and turned to see if
they were still following.  They were, and were about as far behind as I'd
expect ordinary speed mobs to be.

It is possible I misjudged, though, and they were running somewhere between
low level Selo's and level 20 SoW.
