Yep, cancel magic is a very low aggro spell, does no damage at all, and 
has precious little effect.  I use it to pull a lot anyway, because that 
makes it easier for my pet to get the mob off me, and because its cheap. 
  I've observed, though, that in addition to making it easier for me to 
ditch aggro after pulling, that it seems to be the best odds approach 
for me to pull a single.

Malaise would probably work just as well, and debuff the target, but in 
this case the targets don't really need to be debuffed, my spells are 
landing find, and cancel magic is cheaper than anything I have in the 
Mala line.
