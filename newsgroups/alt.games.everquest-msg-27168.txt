Not bad. You got it on the first clue. :) This looks to me like maybe 
someone playing their first "tank" type class? I've seen the type 
before. Was grouped with a Iksar monk in LOIO at the goblin mines. The 
monk in question actually stated that, "get that warrior I don't pull." 
Uh, ok. So after my wife died healing his dumb ass he has the nerve to 
ask for a sow. Fortunately the enchanter in our group was good and 
informed him it might be a while cause she's bound in FV. He say "huh?". 
I then say, "SHE DIED YOU MORON" and /disband. Unfortunately, not 
everyone received a clue when born.

Personally I'd have waited for a reply. A little amusement such as that 
will calm me down a bit. :)

You are 100% correct. Personally I'd have blown all my mana buffing and 
dotting and such. Then when he actually NEEDS a heal - OOM! A little 
lesson in objectivity never hurts now and then.

Sometimes we get lucky like that.
