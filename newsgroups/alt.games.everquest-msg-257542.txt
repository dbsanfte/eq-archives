So whats the deal with those new 1900 point items being removed from the 3rd
patch today? People have already bought them and are running around with
them... for those of u who werent lucky enuf to login and buy those items
"FREE OF CHARGE" (there was a bug so the NPC didnt charge for the items)....

Please do a database check, and remove those items from play if we arent
supposed to have them yet.
