Well, yeah that's true.  To be honest, I wouldn't be against a server reset
at all to balance things out.  Perhaps limit character creation to the
underdog team when one lags behind.  But I'd still play Iksar, whether that
makes me a wuss or not!  Sure, I joined evil to follow my regular grouping
friends, but I'm hooked now. ;)
MY idea, not long after it started, was to make the Iksar race a 4th team.
It'd take a big chunk out of evil, take away the big happy Kunark newbie
garden for the current evil team, and makes way more sense from a
roleplaying perspective.  The Iksar should be aligned with nobody but
Iksar!!
