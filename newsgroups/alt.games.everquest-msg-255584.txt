Lineage II is perhaps the first MMORPG  universe that went terribly wrong,
here's why:

They have big trouble with oriental people (mostly Korean) setting
themselves up with their entire family and farming stuff so they can sell it
on ebay. They camp alot of places 24/7 and killsteal or kill you until you
leave them alone. They dont care if u kill them, since they are not there to
play the game, they just want to farm to earn cash from ebay. When you turn
"red" they kill you, and they got the numbers to do it. U can kill 30 of
them and they just phone up their friends and family etc and its a never
ending army of 'Woo Flung Dung007' etc. Also they use bots ingame to help
farm, so actually you have 1 real person controlling 10 bots in one area.
Even tho this is illegal ingame, the developers do nothing and they don't
even look into the problems when they are petitioned. The really bad thing
is that these places being farmed are often places where you need to quest
something from, so in effect you are basically stranded not able to complete
quests or do anything ingame at all. These people cant speak english either,
and since they dont play the game for entertainment, they dont want to group
with you either, they just want to farm the stuff to sell on ebay 24/7. Alot
of western players have quit the game and moved on.

The drop rates are so tiny that i heard it was like "kill 1000 mobs, get
1cp, repeat until you get 1plat". This in effect causes people to permacamp
stuff who end up ruining the game for everyone else. Putting camps into
instanced zones isnt really an option either, since then you effectivly
remove the MMO from MMORPG, then you might aswell just buy a copy of
Neverwinter Nights and just use multiplay with a few friends. (LDoN & GoD
contradicts MMORPG classifications)

EQ Noob Designer1: "Hey guys, lets make a MMORPG where players can only
group with 5 others and seal them off from the rest of the game and lets
limit huge raiding parties to 32 people!"
EQ Noob Designer2: "Now thats what i call MASSIVE! Great idea!"
