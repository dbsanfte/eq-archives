Hey everyone,

I realize this is off-topic, but I thought some of you might be of
interested in it.

Anyone ever play any of the King's Quest games?  They were adventure
games made by Sierra in the 80's & 90's.  Well, once Sierra was bought
by Vivendi, they decided not to make adventure games anymore.   So, in
2002, some fans decided to make their own King's Quest game, to pay
homage to the series.  (Their website is www.kqix.com)

They worked on it for almost four years, and we about to release it in
December, when Vivendi sent them a cease & desist letter.  They were
forced to shut down.

A group of fans, including myself, have organized in an effort to save
the game. We've recently launched a website. 

http://www.savekqix.org 

Our goal is to get as many people to email Vivendi as possible. We
want people to voice their disappointment that the game has been shut
down. We've made it very easy to do this via our website. There's an
email link, and if you click on it, a new email will open up with the
message all ready to go. You just have to click send. It literally
only takes a few seconds. 

We're also on MySpace. If you're on over there, feel free to add us to
your friends list.
