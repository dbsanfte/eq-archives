EB item and to a lesser extent See Invis item, yes, everyone in the high 
end game should have one.  No charges, not expensive, easy to come by, 
and very helpful; the see invis one less so, but it makes travel with a 
group less annoying for your groupmates who might have to cast it on you 
(and probably don't have to on themselves, since they have the items)

Cast EB is incredibly annoying, probably causes more deaths than cast 
Invis; invis fading usually gives you enough time to find somewhere 
safe, but EB may very well fade at a time when you don't have a chance 
to find air... worse, it tends to go out when you are momentarily AFK, 
leaving you to drown of nothing but your own stupidity.

Your examples with SOW, porting, levitating are right on the point, 
though, and your DS, HP Buffs, and even healing aren't far off it. 
Group mates support each other by supplying the tools each other's 
classes lack.

If you were crossing an undead area that you needed to bypass 
(admittedly, much rarer than same situation with live mobs) would you 
expect everyone but the cleric/pally/necro/SK/enchanter (hmm, lots of 
people can cast that) to drink ITU potions rather than just stand there 
for a second while the cleric pumps out a quick sunskin?
