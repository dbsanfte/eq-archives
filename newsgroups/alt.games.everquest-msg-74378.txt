Well, I haven't quite decided how to deal with the "Gix thing"... I seem to
die from him all too often, and it seems to have NO bearing on where I sit
in the zone. I wonder, sometimes, if he's also programmed to just whack the
lowest lvl person in a radius of "n". sigh. He's killed me far too many
times now, but I'm beginning to keep track. ASAP, I'm gonna whack him every
time he spawns. I know, he's only a program and as such, will never feel a
thing... I, however, will feel an enormous amount of pleasure. Someday.
