This is interesting. Though I don't like EQ2 either. Or maybe dislike is
to harsh a word. It just doesn't appeal to me. Sure the first time I
entered the game I was stunned. The graphics are awesome. But after a
while I thought the graphics is all EQ2 has. :(

Even though this might not be true the very fast paced combat combined
with nearly no downtime made for a very lonesome game experience.
As there is no need to group alot of people choose to go solo. And even
if you have found a group it's often quieter than a baldurs gate party.
Everyone is happily mashing buttons and don't ever try to just sit down
and talk...

Since I mentioned combat let me explain a few things there. First the
mobs. As Bob already pointed out you will know whether a mob is going to
attack you or not. The KoS mobs have their name outlined in red. But
there is NO social aggro. You could pull a mob right out of a horde of kos
mobs and none would assist it unless you are going in aggro range. And
then it isn't exactly social behaviour... :(

Further the combat is darn fast. And since the crowd control department
is somewhat lacking the fights are rather boring. Playing a scout my
heaviest damage comes from positional and stealthed attacks. Due to
mages blasting the mobs I often find myself standing 20 feet away from
the mob. And going in stealth I probably wouldn't reach the mob before
it dies. Sure I could raise the point in the group. But why wait for the
scout to start? The mob died so everything was right. ^^

Long story short...it just isn't my game.

Inspite of this I'm grateful for EQ2. It made me realize what good a
game EQ1 really is. Sure it has it's problems. But I can live with it.
