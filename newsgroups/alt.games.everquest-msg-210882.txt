Hard to say whether a wizard root+nuke+med is more boring than a warrior
tank+bandage+sit. I've done both. I haven't timed it lately, but it seemed
like a wizard could go from 0m to FM much faster than a warrior can go
from 50h to FH. So the warrior lost out that way. On the other hand, the
actual combats, ie, the exciting part of playing your class, is over in
about 15 seconds for a wizard, and about a minute or 3 for a warrior. So
the wizard lost out that way.

Safety-wise, wizard wins hands down. The risks to being a wizard soloing
are mostly covered by spells -- root, invis, shadowstep, gate. The risks to
being a warrior soloing are mostly covered by -- nothing! Get an add? You're
dead. Need to kill off a caster fast? You're dead.

Oh well.
