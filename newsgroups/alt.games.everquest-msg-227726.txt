DKP has advantages and disadvantages.  Quite some time ago (and in another
guild), we had an alliance raid on Talendor - neither we nor our allies had
the forces to take him down, so we did what good allies do and teamed up to
bring the big red guy down.  The fight was successful, with minimal deaths.
After the rezzes were done we sat down to discuss his drops.  Both guilds
had a NBG system in effect, with random between those who could use / will
use (CUWU).

One of the drops was a Runed Bolster Belt - an (at the time very nice)
All/All belt with good haste on it.  To nobody's surprise, every melee in
the raid put their name in.  To many people's surprise, so did the alliance
guild's lead cleric.  A resounding "Huh?" was heard and the guild channel
lit up.  After much pressing, the cleric in question finally announced that
he was claiming it NBG because he wanted the haste for when he was melee'ing
down greens for tradeskill components.  This was met with...  approbation.

I won't bore you with the rest of that situation; I'm sure your imaginations
will fill in the ensuing battle.  The final result was that the officers of
our guild (who had looted the belt) stated that only melee classes would be
permitted to roll (the cleric put his name in again, on the grounds of Sony
wouldn't give clerics their uber summoned hammers unless they were
considered a melee class).  In the end, a warrior in the alliance guild won
the roll and the cleric gated out in anger.  The row eventually got bad
enough that the alliance was dissolved two weeks later.

My point?  Under a pure DKP system, if the greedy basta- ahem.  If the
cleric had the DKP to buy the belt, he would have bought it and that was
that.  Under the NBG/CUWU system, the officers could step in and say "Nope,
just because you can equip it doesn't mean NBG allows you to claim it."

I think a blended system is best, with NBG/CUWU deciding who will be
permitted to bid and then DKP rewarding the bidders who raid most often.
But that's just me.
