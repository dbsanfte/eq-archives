Seems only fair.  My Iksar has spent a lot of time raising faction
in other places, and so far all I've managed is that I'm liked in
Qeynos -- as long as I avoid the Wizards and Bards.  It feels good
sometimes to see someone struggling with the opposite problem. :-)
(I don't take it personally, of course.  I've even been known to
help the occasional poor soul rescue a corpse. :-)

While researching the Iksar Monk quests recently, I ran across one
person's description of what it took to be able to bank in Cabilis.
Entertaining reading, including pathing maps and screen shots.  If
you're curious, do a Google search for "Brell-worshipping Dwarf
Paladin".
