That happens to me maybe 1 time in 100. Would I like to see it fixed... 
you betcha. Is it ruining my life and making me want to play something 
else? Nope.

A year or 2 ago, people with particular nvidia cards were having all 
sorts of stupid problem, before that it was particular brand new radeons 
that couldn't run at more than 10fps.

You have a minor annoyance logging out where it won't let you 
immediately log back in. I'm not surprised its a low priority fix.

Nice scapegoat.

If the expansions were free the bugs would still be there. As long as 
the playerbase wants new content, new content and features will be 
added... this will invariably break stuff that worked before.

Sure, they could have left the graphics the same as they were in 1999 
and the engine would probably have acheived excellent stability by now. 
Of course, we wouldn't have the new spell effects, the new models, the 
new complex zones, etc etc etc...

They traded stability for features. Stable enough and lots of new stuff 
wins over rock solid and nothing gets added that might disrupt it.

Its a GAME not an ATM machine.

Anecdotal evidence. *My* PC doesn't crash on any of those games OR EQ, 
nor other much more modern games either.

I don't know what the conflict is between your PC and and EQ is. I'm not 
saying your PC is at fault, it could be a problem with EQ not supporting 
some oddball driver or hardware you are running... but its probably 
something that you could resolve. Because MOST people don't crash 5 
times a day.

Another minor annoyance. My maps look fine. Its pretty trivial to update 
the maps to work with the default background.
