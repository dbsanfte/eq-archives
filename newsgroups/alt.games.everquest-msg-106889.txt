    Here's my test for your tanking ability: go tank the named kobolds in
Velk's. If you can do that without draining the healer's mana with your
cleric-like HPs, then welcome to Tank Club. Last ranger I grouped with as a
main tank, who I THOUGHT would be OK, ended up gulping my mana because he
needed nearly twice as many CHeals as a warrior with similar gear. I was
disappointed.
