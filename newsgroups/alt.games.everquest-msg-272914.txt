Yes.  However, the quality of the tables/kegs/benches/etc depends on
the level of your guild (or society possibly?).  The higher the level,
the better the max quality.  At the lowest levels you cannot create
anything above the lowest quality (forgot the name, the first bar in
the recipe when you create it - exact opposite of
pristine/refreshing/delectable).

When you are set up as a merchant, you are a merchant and not a broker.
Viewing the market just gives you a chance to scope out the prices so
you can price your stuff competitively.
