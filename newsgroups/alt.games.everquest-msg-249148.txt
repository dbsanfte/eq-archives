that happens often (once or twice a week), regardless of what zone you're in

i remember the first time something like it it happened (to me) - it was
sometime after luclin came out (approx) and it happened to everyone else in
the zone also

BUT

what you describe, though it behaves the same and is also cured by zoning,
doesn't happen zonewide....it just happens to me, and it happens to others
but not to me, and it can happen in any zone

want a placebo? spam /w all wiz 65 and "refresh" your connection to the
server =P
