The former.  I'll give an example.

My character is, I think, the highest high elf smith on the server.  I'm
currently working to outfit our wood elf druids in Mithril chain.  I've
agreed that armor I craft is guild property (its a guild effort to get the
stuff to make it).  Hence, the armor is not given to the guildmate, but
loaned.  If they later upgrade (or leave), we;d like it back for
redistribution.

Here's a raid example.  Say we decide to hit Seb and manage to loot and ES
Helm.  Now, if there is no druid on the raid, and the group decides to
donate it to the guild, then it is "loaned" to a guild druid until they
replace it.  If however the druid was there, then it is his/hers.

Generally do to the tight nit nature of the guild, most "good loot" is
donated.  This keep us all better equiped, but we have to make sure that we
don't allow those in that are just there to soak up resources.
