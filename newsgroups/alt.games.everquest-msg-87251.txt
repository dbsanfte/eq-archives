I wouldn't pay more than 100pp for the Harpoon (if that).  In
fact, go to LoIO, and hang out by the BG's, the Harpoon is lore,
and when the second one drops, I'm sure the person hunting the
BG's will let you have it.  I went through 50 in 4.5 hours on
those guys - saw 3 harpoons drop and could only grab one, so
I just broadcast to the zone that there was one up for grabs,
and gave the location.

On a bit of a tangent, I did an ooc "Harpoon of the depths on
a dead BG at neg 50, neg 90".  And had a guy who wanted me to
leave my camp and bring it to him.  Ummmm, if you aren't willing
to come grab a weapon worth 60pp to a vendor when you're told
exactly where it is, and that the BG's won't pop before it rots
anyway - too bad.  :-/   Left a sour taste in my mouth - heck I
could have been giving them to my pet, for the looks.
