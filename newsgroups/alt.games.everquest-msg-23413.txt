Drones of Doom (ES) does 340 damage.
Drifting Death (44) does 650.

I simply don't have the patience to wait an additional minute (plus the
god-awfully long extra time it takes to cast the stupid ES arms) it requires
to kill a critter.  My friend's druid who I borrow when I PL my characters
has the sleeves and she always uses them too...but she always melees (also
level 52).  I kinda take it as a given that if she wants to pretend she's
not wasting time meleeing when she's at 40% mana she's also pretending the
ES arms aren't a waste of time either.  *shrug* I could be wrong...but I
doubt it. :)

For PLing I use it quite a bit while playing her druid and my wizard.  We
don't group.   The druid pulls with snare, takes a bit of damage (greater
kobolds don't do that much damage to a 52 druid)...the kobold takes lots
more with 29hp DS every swing.  After about 20 seconds my wizard nukes the
kobold with his biggest nuke to get its attention.  While the GK is getting
24hp damage per swing at the wiz, the druid casts the ES arms and has a
seat.  It's not hard for my wizard to do 341 damage (DoD does 340 so that's
all I HAVE to do) and between the 2 nukes or so from me, a heal from the
druid, the damage shields, and the free DOT the critter is dead and the
druid is down only about 20% mana.

Any time the druid has lots more mana than the wizard the druid takes the
abuse for a while longer while the wizard meds.  Any time the wizard has a
lot more mana than the druid, the wizard nukes the hell out of the dog to
kill it fast.
