> Why would the SK be taking less damage, and need less healing than a monk?

    Because they're not as good tanks as they used to be. Maybe you didn't
notice up in the ultra uber top end 65 with more aa points than a nightclub,
but they got nerfed a little ways back, and sony have no intention of them
being better at tanking than "the plate classes".

    Perhaps you're too uber to comment on the pre-50 game or something ;)

    Because an SK with 1000AC now tanks better than a monk with 1000AC.

    In most cases <that I've seen maybe its diffent up in uberlandTM> an SK
can pull a mob and deliver it to the slower pre-agrod to the point where
slow can be cast without stealing agro, before anybody gets hurt. I don't
think that can be beaten for healing efficiency.

    SK and shaman is my favorite duo so far and works extremely well in late
40's early 50's, and people tell me SK agro powers are extremely in demand
in pop also. Monks were never meant to be a true tank class, and fall short
of it now.
