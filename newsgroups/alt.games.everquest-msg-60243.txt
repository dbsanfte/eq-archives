Don't worry about it. The group is not going down.
The message was pure harassment (of news.admin.net-abuse.email,
actually).

The message is a HipCrime post.

It is a "punishment run" rather than one of his spam runs.

There are newsgroups in which 90% of the posts are his spam
(usually a BTV Industries modem hijacking porn dialer, though
other times "affiliate" porn spam).

The goal of this post is to get you to post a followup.
Why? So you can help him out. 
How? But taking part in his flooding of NANAE 
     (news.admin.net-abuse.email).

You can often recognize his posts due to the random Markov
text (see the last line in this post) and the fact that
his "punishment runs" use a "Followup-To:" header redirecting
posts to a newsgroup he wants to get back it if it does not
accept him as the Lord High Ruler of Usenet and accept his
posts as being properly 90% of the allowed posts (a few months
ago, when he targeted a Sherlock Holmes group frequented by
many minors, one day, there were 100 posts - over 70 were
porn ads apparently from him or the HipClones).

A few weeks ago you may have seen an obscenity of Bin Laden
buggering Bush. That was to get folks to post followups.
They were directected to NANAE (it was at attempt to get
you to flood NANAE for him).

Then you may have seen a "Formatting Your Hard Disk" post
(JavaScript pretending to format your hard disk). That
was another.

A few days ago you may have seen an illegal obscenity
of "little boys - I have tapes to sell and trade" wherein
the fraudulent "from" address was that of a regular in NANAE 
(fraud, identity theft).

Soon after than you may have seen "Access Greed" a post
supporting spam - again, to get you to post a followup -
which was directed to NANAE.

Now this.

These are all HipCrime or one of his HipClones.

If you *do* post a followup, be sure to change the newgroups
header so it goes to the group in which you have seen
the original post - or you will be doing just what he
wants you to do ... help him flood NANAE.
-----------------------------------------

You can do a search on message text for "HipCrime" at
groups.google.com (USENET) or google.com (the WEB), for example, 
or visit NANAE (news.admin.net-abuse.email) and post a question 
about him (there are folks there more knowledgeable than I
about his current routines).

He is a spammer. He finds and uses open PROXYs (unsecured
proxies used on home systems with high bandwidth -
cable and DSL modem connections) to post hundreds of
thousands of messages - each with a different subject line
(he uses a random Markov text generator - you can often
recognize his posts, or HipClones - his followers with
whom he shares his programmes - by the subject line -
often there is random text also in the message, even
after embedded UUencoded binaries - the random text is
used to avoid being blocked/filtered by systems that block
multiple posts of messages with identical bodies/subject_lines).

He considers himself the Lord High Ruler of Usenet and strongly
objects to those groups that do not accept him or spam and
"punishes" them.

How to punish such a group? The obvious is to find an open
PROXY (high bandwidth) and use that to post hundreds of thousands of
messages to the target group - each with a different subject line
(so they cannot be blocked by the subject line) - however, in some
groups, the members don't fall for it, notice the path/source in
the header and block on the source. How to punish such a group?

Easy. Don't flood it! Flood every other newsgroup! *But* use messages
designed to induce folks in those groups to post a followup message 
*and* set the "Followup-To:" header in the original post to that
of the target group! If twenty folks in each of 20,000 newsgroups
each post a followup all of which go to the target newsgroup -
a flood! He has managed to get others to flood a newsgroup for him
and the posts can't be blocked based on the path since they (the
followups) come from all over!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to post a followup message to one of his posts (whatever
it is) to alert regulars of your group about what the message is
and what it does, after choosing to post, check the "Newsgroups" header
in the message. If it has been changed (due to a "Followup-To:" header
in the original post to that of a group HipCrime is targetting for
punishment) you will have to change it back to the group in which
the original post appeared so as not to contribute to flooding
the targetted group (as HipCrime desires) and so that the visitors
to your group actually get to see your post!

Don't worry about his having tricked you. Quite a few have fallen
for this ploy. He'll be doing it again, with a different type of
post, again (in a week or so) I am sure. He has been around for
months. Well, he has been around much longer, but he has been
doing this for months...
