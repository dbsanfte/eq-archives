    You don't hate Luclin, you hate the time sinks a power guild goes
through to get to the Luclin endgame. Totally different. ;-)

    Look at the boss mob fights you've had so far. High Priest. Grieg. Shei.
Burrower. People have had more to do with the success of a raid than ever
before, and don't just hit F8 to target big mob, hit "a" to attack, then go
for a pop. Classes that never had much to do before during a fight now are
busy non-stop. Wait until the Emperor fight - it'll amaze you just how busy
everyone is, doing the things their class was designed to do. If anything,
the bosses of Vex Thal will be a letdown for you when you get there.
