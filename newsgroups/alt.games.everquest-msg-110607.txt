Well, right now Casters Realm is advertising some work-at-home scam. Its the
type where they tell you that you can make tons of money, but never tell you
what you need to do... So, no, I dont think Casters Realm is exactly the
right place to look for 'integrity'. And the thought of web-based
advertisers not using a website that wants them, well, thats just funny.
