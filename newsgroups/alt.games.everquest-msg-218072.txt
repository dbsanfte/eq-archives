Worthless because obviously a lot of Florida voters had problems
with it.  Worthless because that type of ballot is subject to becoming
invalid by simply twisting it and dislodging a chad that the voter
had no intent of punching out.  Worthless because those districts
have been ordered by the courts to replace them prior to the coming
presidential election.

Wait, not really, since I just finished a new degree as part of a 
career change and graduated with a 3.95 gpa.
