Been doing anwehere from 3 man to full groups in BoT lately with me as 
slower/haster/healer.  I prefer having a paladin along in that case, but, 
have done it with warrior or SK as the MT.  Smallest was me, 65 warrior, 
65 rogue working the courtyard in BoT.  Quiescense > slowed single mob

This means that a shaman can work just fine as the healer though too, and 
have mana to spare for other things.

No question.  It's even more exciting when you are the main healer too.

I end up using my crappy nukes, particularly my 675 point poison nuke, as 
it is actually extremely mana efficient with ornate gloves and SCM3.

It's still damned handy to have someone to cover backup heals even in 
LDoN at times.

Absolutely, anytime I find myself with extra mana, I start tossing nukes, 
and the odd fast DoT.

Slow becomes more valuable in 65 dungeons unless you have a really 
serious DPS group.  In the case of a DPS group, do what you can to add to 
the DPS, and keep them hasted.

Have not tried a hard mission yet, I am going to try to talk some 
guildies into giving it a go.

All good points, but, damn, you sure do write a lot.  :b
