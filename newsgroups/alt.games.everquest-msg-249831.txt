Unless of course it turns out they were innocent... At least then you 
can give them the rest of their lives back.

And, fwiw, I've read in numerous places that it actually costs more to 
execute them.

In its review of death penalty expenses, the State of Kansas concluded 
that capital cases are 70% more expensive than comparable non-death 
penalty cases. The study counted death penalty case costs through to 
execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 
million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of 
incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000

Google the topic, this isn't some isolated biased page, numerous studies 
from New York, North Carolina, Kansas, etc have all concluded the same 
thing... executions tend to cost 50%-300% more than life sentences, even 
after factoring the savings from not having to feed and gaurd the 
criminal for 20-80 years.
