This information is interesting in a "heads up" fashion, but for most 
people in the group there's a far more important message:

ASSIST me on the %T.

Incoming is interesting to the MA and perhaps malosi/slower, but nobody 
else should really care, as they shouldn't start doing anything until 
assist is called, and would be best off assisting at that point rather 
than sooner, in case an unmezable add or something forces a change in 
intial target.

I am guilty of assisting on incoming with some frequency, but this is 
rarely a real problem since my pet is very good about not breaking mez, 
if I send him at the wrong target things usually work out all right.

I can't think when this would apply, stuns are short duration at best

I've been in several groups recently where the slower was having trouble 
landing slow; I now have a macro that says "Malosi stuck to %t, go ahead 
and slow".

I admit I -could- put that in a tailored tell to the slower, but I'm 
lazy, I have it in a group macro so I can use it whenever its important. 
  However, I only use it in groups where someone's mentioned they are 
having trouble sticking spells; I cast malaise or something if -I- am 
having trouble sticking, but I don't mention it unless it seems relevant 
to the rest of the group.

On the other hand, if someone else is having trouble sticking snare or 
slow or just nukes, its very relevant information to them when malosi 
sticks, they can wait casting their spell until it does, and save a lot 
of wasted mana on resisted spells.

Oh,and yes, I do cast malaise, malaisement, or malosi as the situation 
seems to require, but announce malosi every time; again, I'm too lazy to 
edit the macro for full accuracy every time... I use the cheapest thing 
that will do the job required but announce my best spell in the line as 
if I always used that.  Now my secret's out!
