Might I suggest you go to this thread on the Monkly-Buisness and take
a look at the equipment suggestions.

Look at all your equipment and assess the weight of it...   I think I
only have 2 items that have a weight of 1 or higher (items being armor
that is, weapons are usually heavier)

here is link for the main forum
http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508

but for equipment go here
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3

the first two Threads that are Locked are great resource of
information.

Always remember HP is king, then AC...      Weight is a balance factor

Good luck
