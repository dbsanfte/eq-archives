We were, for the most part.  We spawned the executioner 5 or 6 times that
night, out of perhaps 9 attempts.  (And one of the failures was due to a
bug.  Only 3 mobs spawned in the 4'th wave.  You couldn't kill the 4'th mob
to face the executioner, since it ever popped)

Each time we got the executioner slowed almost immediately, but I noted no
reduction whatsoever in attack speed.   We got him as low as 90, then 40,
then 5 percent, then 20 or so.

*shrug*  Perhaps shaman slow was working somewhat.   Or maybe those AoW /
Cursed / etc loots were helping just a tiny bit.   I did not find him to be
trivial.
