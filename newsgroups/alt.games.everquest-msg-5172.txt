You will not evade me, "Magpie13" <magpie13nospam@pacbell.net>:

>I am now level 49 (very close to 50) and have learned much from them.
 
Getting up there, eh? :)

>My enjoyment from the game is purely social. If my friends aren't on I solo,

I have a friend who used to be in UPS. Don't know much about Moment of
Clarity. I'm happy with my (steel) rosies even though I don't get to
hunt with them as much as I'd like :)

>This NG has become...odd

'Ignore thread' can work wonders with that.

>I just wanted to point out that EQ is a fun game (flawed yes, but not to the
>point of traumatic) and hope to see you all in a nasty Vox raid!

Been quite a few of those lately, hasn't it? (I just lost my med book,
but I've had friends on nasty CR in Permafrost several times)

>BTW - Call me Dude, Bro or Bud and you will be ignored....

I get dude, man, bro etc all the time. Anyone who calls me that is
politely requested to make it lady instead. I guess I'd have to have
an incredibly obvious feminine name to get away from that :/
