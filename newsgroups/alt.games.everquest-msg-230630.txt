First I ever saw was the (then uber) Bladed Thulian Claw.  IIRC it was
originally called a Bladed Demon Claw?  Or something on those lines.

I wanted one for my bard forever.  They sold for the princely sum of
300pp back then, which was double my entire life savings at 16 - which
I then spent on a set banded, a dragoon dirk and a dwarven axe.
