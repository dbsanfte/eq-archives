Why are you even worrying? You're within a level or two of when you're
going to max out those skills for ten levels or so.  Just ignore
defense, it will quickly max on it's own. You dont' say your class, but
I assume it's a melee type. The forties are a great time to start maxing
out all your less used weapons forms, though.
