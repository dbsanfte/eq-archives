: Oh, come on, Ed, haven't you figured it out yet?  Water's wet, Sky is
blue,
: and I'll be bitching about Paladins being underpowered.

: In all honesty, I think Paladins are just a touch under where we need to
be.
: A few more tweaks, and they should have it right.  A snare undead would
help
: quite a bit (and be perfectly acceptable from a role-playing standpoint.
: Call it Bonds of Nife, or something like that).  Along with the Brell's
: line, maybe another Pally only buff would be nice, but not required.  The
: group heals are a great idea, maybe make them a tad more efficient.

: Now, it's the warriors who I seriously think SoE hates.  They aren't
better
: enough than the knights to justify them in anything but the most HP
: intensive raids.  They seriously need some balance there (and a fix to the
: AC system, and removal of the soft-cap).
:
: And I still want long hair for my half-elf.

"[Archangel!] Why have you behaved so? You have cheated, lusted,
 stolen, gossiped, murdered, envied, hated, lied.
 You have cursed, robbed, overspent, overeaten, fornicated,
 disobeyed, embezzled, and blasphemed. Oh, the duties you have
 shirked, the children you have abandoned! Who has ever so ignored
 the poor, so played the coward, so belittled my name? ....
 I hate, I loathe these things in you!. . .
 Can you not feel my wrath?"
