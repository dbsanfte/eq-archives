<sigh>

You really are dense.

I have contended all along that the statements you made are obvious to
anyone who has played EQ more than a couple of months. I never
disagreed with what you said about EQ, because what you said was
common knowlegde. I am only calling you a liar when you claim you work
for VI/Sony.

I suggest you read the above as many times as it takes for you to
understand it.
