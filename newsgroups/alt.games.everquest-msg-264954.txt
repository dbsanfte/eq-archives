What freaked me out was they changed the name of one of the
cultural sewing needles, from Tier'dal Needle to Koada'dal Needle,
I think.  I only noticed because suddenly my bazaar mule had an
item with no price on it.  (The prices are stored on your computer
based on the item name, so when the name changed it no longer saw
the price in the file.)

I wonder why they did that?
