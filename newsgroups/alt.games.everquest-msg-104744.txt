	EHHH???

	You seriously think fighters are going to outdamage casters on a DPS
basis???  Are you insane?

	The "weakness" of damage casters is that with the 32K HP cap gone,
raid-level mobs can now have enough HP that casters will run OOM long before
the mob dies.  It this were not true, then the casters could leave the
fighters home and blow the mobs to pieces in seconds -- which, btw, is how
Wizards with Manaburn deal with Kunark raid mobs.
