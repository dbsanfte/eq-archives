You have beg and pickpocket in the same
macro?   Hope you like locked-up hotkeys.
:-)

I don't even macro it.  1 stops auto attack,
2 pickpockets, 1 auto attacks again.

If I NEED to evade, 1 stops auto attack,
6 hides, 1 auto attacks again.  I absolutely
REFUSE to pickpocket or beg or disarm
or anything along with evade.  If it's bad
enough to NEED to evade, then why do
the little things that might help get aggro
back on you quicker?

Why would you not want to evade? If you're
grouping with a Warrior and a druid, for
instance, and get aggro, there's no
guaruantee that the Evade is going to
put aggro back on the warrior...and I
hate evading my aggro off onto an
enchanter or druid or some other
fragile beastie.
