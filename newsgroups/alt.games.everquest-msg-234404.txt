Ack!  That would be even worse.  My current CPU (Celeron 330) i sjust
barely playable in some zones, and almost anything Luclin or later can
be brutal on the machine.  LoY and Jaggedpine are unplayable, Nedaria
is pretty, but will crash me out of the game everytime.

(Yes, I know I need an upgrade)

Now, if some of the instructions that require DX9 were 'tunable' (eg
Dynamic Lighting) thaf may be a viable workaround.  But I'm not
holding out hope.  I know it's time for the game to move forward ;-)
