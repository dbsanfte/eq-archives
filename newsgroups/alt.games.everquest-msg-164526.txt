You pull your gun out of the cybernetic holster, aim it at
the bikers, and say "You have 10 seconds to disperse.
This is an unlawful assembly.  You have 8 seconds to
disperse."

Then wait until they bounce a couple of shots off of your
armor while cursing and then blow them away with like
a billion bullets.

Wait, the main character in PQ1 is Robocop, right?
