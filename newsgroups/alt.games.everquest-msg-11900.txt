Not as such, no.  Be we are the only casters that get this.

Personally I would LOVE a mana drain spell that drains hit points from the
target and gives me mana... 1 to 1 would be nice, but 2 to 1 would be okay
too, as long as it was a respectable amount of damage/mana (a hundred or
more).

    Give it a cast time of like 2.0 and have it take like 5 mana, with a
repop of 2 seconds.

    But then, I'd be a gawd.
