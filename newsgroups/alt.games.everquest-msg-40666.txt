Just thought I'd let anyone who cares know.  I went to the Microsoft update
site, and ran the product update program, it suggested updating, among other
things, my sound drivers with new ones they had available.  I did so, and
the sound is, while not perfect, far better than it was.  So if anyone is
still having sound problems with Win2k, I would highly recommend checking it
out, might help them too.
