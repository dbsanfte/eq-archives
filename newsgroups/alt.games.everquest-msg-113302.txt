Don't *EXPECT* the sow in return, don't get pissed off if you don't
get it. If I didn't ask for the breeze, there's no garauntee that I'm
going to SOW in return. If I'm sitting on my but chatting or
roleplaying and thus not using mana, what the fuck do I need breeze
for? If I don't have SOW memmed, you ain't getting it. If I have it
memmed, sure. But, to me, that's like some idiot that ran up to my
necro in SK once and put a bunch of food and water in the trade window
without saying anything. When I clicked trade, she sat there for a
minute (without clicking trade herself), then said "That'll be 5pp
plz".
