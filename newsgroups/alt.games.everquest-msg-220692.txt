You're correct. Michelle is trying to get someone to listen.
Unfortunately, liberals have a very short attention span, and
selective hearing. Unfortunately, with the Liberal bias in the media,
that means that the majority of the US doesn't even KNOW about Mecha.

Hell, my Mexican friends do the same. What's your point? One in
particular is a Mexican/American who grew up in Juarez/ElPaso and
renounced his dual citizenship at 18 for US Citizenship so he could
join the US Army. He's

But on evey page of evey website of theirs I've seen, they have "Por
la raza, todo, Fuere de la Raza nada."

Notice how Raza is capitolized? And notice how they use the word, just
assuming that Raza is understood... that they are the ONLY race? White
Supremacists at least tell us they support the white race. Same for
Black supremacists.

Really? Go look under google for Mecha constitution why don't ya.
Almost all of the chapter constitutions reference the national
constitution.

Actually, you're using weasel words and half truths. But I agree.. at
least you aren't using feelings. It's a start. Now if you could just
get away fromt he lies.

Hey! You got it in one! The Palestinians are terrorists. No not all of
them, but enough to make that a true statememnt. Their leader is
Egyptian, the Name "Palestine" was coined by he Romans, and they were
given 99% of what they wanted by Sharon during the Clinton era on a
silver platter and turned it down. They march in parades with 2 year
old babaies that have toy dynamite strapped to them, and target
shopping malls and discos. These aren't brave warriors. They're
religious nutcases that think they'll get 72 virgins when they blow
themselves up for "the cause." While Arafat & his toadies recieve
literally millions, if not more, from the Governments of the world,
their people live in crappy conditions. Of course, the "Relocation
camps" would be called cities in any other place.

Face it, There WAS no Palestinian movement until the Jews moved in.
Israel was a goat herder's camp, and was completely undeveloped. The
Palestinians don't want their land back. They want each & every Jew in
the area dead. Of course I think Ill of the Palestinians.

The Jews aren't angels, but at least they aren't bombing shopping
malls and busses!



Finally, here's a quote from my friend about Mecha... I think it's
pretty good.
