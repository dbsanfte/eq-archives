Actually, if you're in a raiding guild, especially if you're raiding 
places where extraction is a major pain in the butt, you pretty much have 
to trust someone with your password eventually.  When you have a corpse 
stuck in Veeshan's Peak, and you're going to need you, a necro, and two 
clerics to recover it (and 1 cleric AND the necro have to die to get you 
out), then yeah, it's sometimes useful to have someone else know your 
password.  I have a list of passwords for CR, even though a bard is 
generally useless for CR.  I had an odd work schedule, and two EQ capable 
computers, so I was asked to help fairly often.

Excuse me, but having a couple close friends know your password is not 
the same as having everyone know it.  The person who has my password also 
has the keys to my apartment in case I lock myself out.  I guess I should 
be more worried that he's going to sell my Singing Steel BP rather than 
come into my apartment, take my computers and stereo and big screen and 
my Picasso (ok, only a signed lithoograph, but still).  
What about guild gem twinks, and spell twinks and camp-out clerics?  At 
the end game it's a given that you will be sharing your password with at 
least a couple guildmembers, for emergancy purposes at least.  
We currently have ~60 active or semi-active members in our guild, and 
we've been a guild for almost a year.  In that time we have had a SINGLE 
incident of someone selling items from another account, and that involved 
a mage leaving the game, giving his account to someone else, and telling 
him to do whatever he wanted.  The mage became out PoM CoH whore, most of 
the droppable gear was sold off, and that was fine.  The original account 
owner came back to the game, and was pissed off for about 1 day, but knew 
he had no reason to be pissed.  It took maybe a week to re-equip him, and 
there were no hard feelings.  
If you don't want to share your password don't.  In fact, for 95% of the 
game there is NO NEED to share your password.  Eventually certain guilds 
get to the point where having 2 or 3 people who can log your character on 
becomes a requirement.  We certainly don't force people to share their 
passwords, but if you need a complex CR, you'll have to organize it or 
give the CR crew access to your account.
