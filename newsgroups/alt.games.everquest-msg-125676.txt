I haven't logged into EQ in the last three weeks; I've been playing GTA III 
non-stop since I bought it.This is the first time it happens to me since EQ 
came out, but it's probably due to 52-53 being excruciatingly boring levels 
for a druid.

Of course, it has been true since day 1 that I get probably as much 
enjoyment out of the newsgroup as I do out of EQ itself.
