Yeah, with your setup before the new release there's only a couple places on
the Old World that you got bad frame rates (Unrest being unplayable, and a
couple other minor places).  Minimum requirements since they upped the
graphics engine for all kinda FORCES you into at least 128MB RAM, I would
think.  I'm guessing that 200MHz may be possible but damned annoying though.
