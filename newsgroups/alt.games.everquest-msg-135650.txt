Sorry, but HUGE freaking difference between "uber" as the previous
poster referred to (i.e. Epic weapons suck) and having 10K in the bank.
A guy in our guild who's highest level character is a 52 ranger built up
a tinkering alt, and between his main and the gnome grandmastered
fletching and tinkering. He's made over 50K just on archery stuff,
selling mostly to vendors. 

Getting weapons that the uberguild members love to refer to, where you
can laugh at epics, will never be done with tradeskills. They are done
by having keys to ST, VT, etc. and the forces to take down the mobs
therein. The vast majority of players will never do that, and for that
vast majority, the epics are still pretty epic.
