  OK.... I'm guessing this next question will get a resounding  "NO you
can't do that" but as has been evidenced already I am A) Not a programmer or
Engineer (I will be starting VB classes in January, soon to be followed by C
classes) AND B) I like to ask questions. It's how you learn.
  I've been reading about Linus, Tannenbaum and the early days of
comp.os.minix and such. It seems to me that a lot of stuff was ported and to
some extent re-written from scratch.
  If you have to use old school calls to access hardware in Linux... Why
can't they just add API functionality to the kernal? I mean think about it,
is anything REALLY impossible with code? Or is it just a matter of time,
effort and who holds the copyright/patent. Isn't Linux designed to be
Modular, so you can add new abilities with out screwing up everything else?
  They had to figure out how to make API's for Wintel boxes in the
beginning? They just didn't spring fully formed out of some computer one day
saying "Hey... Over here". I suppose really it's up to the Hardware end of
it in the end to do. But if they got to work on it think of the additional
money they could make (HINT hardware manufacturers). It's not a lot by the
standards they're used to but it's still an additional revenue stream. The
first company to do it that put out a usable product would gain a loyal and
rabid following by my thinking.

Just more thoughts from the peanut gallery
