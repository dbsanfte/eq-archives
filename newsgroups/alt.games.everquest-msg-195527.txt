Well, for what it's worth, without KEI Hanrahan would have retired at 51 
rather than at 61, so if KEI is a crutch, it's a most welcome one.

Comparisons between caster downtime and melee downtime are meaningless... 
A melee character can be healed to full by a single spell, but they 
can't restore the caster's mana in return. KEI simply makes things a bit 
better, not only for casters, but for all. After all, downtime in an XP 
group is generally for the healers to get their mana back, not for the 
melees to get their HP back naturally.
