Again another person not reading or misinterpreting what I said.
I know very well what the spell is sold for, that does not automagically
make it the RIGHT price.
And if you feel like paying the price do so, but if not you will have to
find the spell yourself with friends/guildies.
It is after all as I previously said meant as a raid spell and as such a
guild really should help out in aquiring it for their enchanters, not for
the enchanters increased fortune in PP but for the good of the mana
regeneration of the guild on raids.

Our guild is working hard to help our enchanter get the spell. This has been
done by gathering research components for our resident GM researcher or
arranging raids on the mobs that drop it. Or even gather funds to buy the
spell of the vendor mules of the uberguild_01 that is camping above
mentioned mobs effectively barring anyone else from haveing a chance at a
drop.
