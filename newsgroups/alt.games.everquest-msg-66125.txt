In order to play SoL I will have to upgrade my m-voard, graphics card, and Processor, al lesst 6
months before I was initally going to do so. Which is to say no big deal. I personally am glad thay
Verant did not require XP to run SoL. If that had been the case, I would have dumped the game.
More than likely, the next wave of the trilogy boxes will have the Win95 taken off and the older one
will have an updated label placed on them. A for going back to directx8.0a, I don't see it happeing.
That would be like Microsoft going back to DOS in the next Windows upgrade, rather stupid on their
part. Th efew palyers lost because of this will not impact the game itself or it longevity, which to
say will only be around until something bigger and better comes along.
