yes you did, the ranger was charmed, unless the wizard could root the
ranger till it wore off, you would have all died.

i was in a similar situation once, only i was a 30ish druid, we had a
warrior, a shammy and a monk, the monk went to go pull, came back with
two, next thing i know, the monk is beating the snot out of me, and i
die.

monk: did druid die?
me: yeah
monk: shammy, why didn't you heal him?
shammy: my heal takes 3 seconds to cast, you did the druid in 2.5
seconds.

hehe that was about the truth too, i looked at my logs later, dropped
me like a bad habit.



another time in paw a friend of mine, a bard, was hunting, the warrior
was charmed, the bard counter charmed the warrior and sent him back in
to the fray =)
needless to say the warrior was a little confused after the fact.
