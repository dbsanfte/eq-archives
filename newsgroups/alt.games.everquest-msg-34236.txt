Hehe, some people are just stupid. For the bog juice im sure the guy cant know
its the most basic item to start with, have been payed 50pp for 2 bog juices
once, financed my brewing to over 100 skill.
Same with pottery, i made a lot of money on pottery in my days with Wis
deities, but i still have NO idea why people would pay the 250pp i took for
them.
Or just the 150-175 they sell for today.

Cost around 60pp and 1-2 hours to learn pottery to a skill where you can make
the deities, and Sands of Ro can usually be aquired from between 0-50pp if you
cant kill the SGs yourself, or get someone to do it for you.

Or how about baking? Cant even count the times i have been asked to make Fish
Rolls for people for 5pp a stack.
Can easily be mastered, i got to 136 (or what skill fish rolls is trivial at)
skill in a few hours, including the running from EC to EFP and back, and that
was even before i found out you can also get batwings in WFP. Think it cost me
around 100pp to get to that skill, and i took the easiest way (batwing
crunchies, only need to be in EC, till trivial, then fish rolls till trivial),
am sure you can master it for around 75pp if you do it the cheapest way.


And best of all with those easy tradeskills:
You dont need to spend hours trying to find someone to make the stuff for you.
