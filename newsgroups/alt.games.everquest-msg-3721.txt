The problem with that theory is that the following two things
are distinct server-side actions:

  1.  Turning a mob from friendly (or at least indifferent) to
      "trying to kill you" (i.e., aggroing, which is the
      "beggars like you" action you mention).

  2.  Moving yourself up a mob's "hate list" once you're already
      aggroed (i.e. via Taunt, Stun, doing damage, etc.)

Begging can clearly do #1, but it's not proven that it can do #2,
nor is it even reasonable to assume that something which can
trigger #1 can also do #2.
