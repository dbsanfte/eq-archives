Only skill level applies to success (or at least that is the
current wisdom, based on info gathered by many tradeskillers).
For most tradeskills the higher of WIS or INT will affect your
chance of getting a skill-up on a particular combine.  For some
tradeskills there is a third stat that will substitute for INT
or WIS if it is higher than either, ex: Blacksmithing skill-ups
are affected by the highest of WIS, INT, or STR.
