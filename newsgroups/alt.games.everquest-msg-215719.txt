You don't understand, it seems. This wasn't just the standard moving
quickly. This was reckless rushing. This was not bothering to make
sure no one was falling behind. The DPS in this group was such that
the shaman didn't have time to sit for more than half a second after
catching up with the puller. Cani was the *ONLY* mana regen beyond
natural standing regen that he was getting.

Yes, the dungeons are fast-paced. But usually not so stupidly so.
There's a difference between fast-paced moving and rushing. Rushing
only increases the risk of getting the whole group killed. When the ML
is looting as fast as she can a pile of 3 mobs and the puller and
group are out of sight before she's even gotten to the second, it's
going way too fast.

The only thing that saved us from a disaster was our DPS and a lot of
luck...
