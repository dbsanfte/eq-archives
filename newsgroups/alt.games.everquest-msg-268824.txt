Personally, I don't have a problem with people power-levelling. If
you've worked for years to build up wealth and items and wanted to
remake your character, the majority of that wealth wouldn't help at
all in EQ2. You're level restricted for what kinda armor you can wear,
and there doesn't exist any expensive noob items that you could buy.
Basically, you have to do it the long and hard way every time out of
some arbitrarily imposed idea of it being more fun (or more time
consuming).

> No kill stealing.

The reason this occurs is because of game imbalances as well. Too many
people and not enough mobs and space. There's also no
reputational/community penalties for being a jerk in the game.

We can look to the real world for clues as to how to prevent this
kinda behavior. People don't make livings out of stealing stuff in
masse because the consequences outweigh the risk. As a last resort,
GMs should be able to kick people that have dedicated their time to
ruining the game for others.

> No buff bots.

I don't have a problem with people dual-boxing a main character and a
buffer. If they wanted to discourage this they could just not make
buffs so necessary to fight effectively.
