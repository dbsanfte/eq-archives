Erm, being a previous 59 Cleric, I think it's very wrong not to rez a 
party member regardless of why/how they died.  If you dont like them, 
ask them to leave, or leave yourself, but you should never NOT rez 
someone who has died in your group.

e.g.

You are in a group, deep in a dungeon, the only way out for melee is 
either gate potion or translocate.  If the Wiz left because you were 
being an ass, you have no gate potion, you'd be stuck there, prolly die etc.

It's like not buffing someone.  It's like an enchanter not mezzing. 
It's like a melee not taunting.  Druid/Shaman not sowing when you 
travelling.  Monk not feigning when pulling.

It's a skill that is limited to 2 classes.  Therefore you expect a 
person to be at their best when grouping and using ALL available skills.
Certain things are expected of certain classes where it is beneficial to 
the group.

Courtesy my ass.  Remember that next time your group cleric doesnt rez 
you. :)
