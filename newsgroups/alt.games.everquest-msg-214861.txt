<snip Davian's clued in discourse>

Case in point, one of our members just got a promotion at work.
He'll no longer be able to make raids.  He mentioned it to the
council, they put him on hold (His raid record is frozen - he
can no longer gain RPP, but he also keeps his current attendence
stats)

This morning (Saturday) he logged on and we grabbed him immediatly
for a LDoN group.  The only thing he loses by being on hold is
the ability to benefit from the raids *THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO
ATTEND ANYWAY*

He went on hold because he wants to keep grouping with us (his
friends) and chatting with us when he can play on weekends - and
we want him to stay because we like him.

He believes he'll be able to make time to raid again after he's
gotten things lined up in his new position, at which time he 
goes off hold and continues raiding and getting loot like before.
