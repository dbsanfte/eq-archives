   Interesting article.  Here is a snip of the part relevant to this
thread.

Humans have also acted as guinea pigs with oleoresin capsicum. It is an
ingredient in super-hot sauces with words in the name like insanity, death,
and suicide. These sauces are tasted at food shows by people who have no
idea of how hot they are. Some people, with few tastebuds in the mouths,
are not bothered by the extreme heat. But most people react very negatively
to the super-hot sauces, experiencing severe burning and sometimes
blistering of the mouth and tongue. Other immediate responses have included
shortness of breath, fainting, nausea, and spontaneous vomiting. People
should be very careful of commercial hot sauces that list oleoresin
capsicum as an ingredient. Aside from the above adverse effects, the
super-hot sauce will not hurt you. "Comprehensive nutritional studies have
not shown any adverse effects of chile or capsaicinoids even at ten times
the maximum use levels," wrote the one world's experts on capsaicin, V.S.
Govindarajan, author of the mammoth study, Capsicum--Production,
Technology, Chemistry and Quality. But even if you do overindulge in
capsaicinoids, do not worry, for they are quickly metabolized in the liver
and excreted in urine within a few hours.

   Fainting?  I never considered that as a side effect from eating hot
sauce!

   But still, on the whole, this article supports my notion of "Super Hot
Sauce might be very unpleasant, but not deadly".  Like I've said, this
person is bringing out the negative side of me.  They steal from me, they
can bloody well have some negative effects themselves.
