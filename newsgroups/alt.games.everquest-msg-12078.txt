Pretty much, Sean.  I'm pretty sure Highland Lions run at faster than
sow speed, but, like I said, if you stay near the river you probably
won't ever see one.

However, I had forgotten about ol' Grimmy..  That could be bad news,
but he rarely hangs out around the southern end of the zone.  Just be
sure to avoid the druid ring, as he likes to take on Tak Whistler
every so often.
