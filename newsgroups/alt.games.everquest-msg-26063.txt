Plus it's a good guilt trip:

"See? My god (good one) allowed you to be healed. Your god forsook (sp?)
you, aparantly because you're not very important to him. You going to
continue to worship a god like that? Now let me tell you about my
god........"

Gotta love holy crusades :)

Of course, like Tyger said, an evil cleric might be allowed to heal a good
person, in attempts to win that person over to "the dark side". Coincedence
can be a strong motivator, applied properly.
