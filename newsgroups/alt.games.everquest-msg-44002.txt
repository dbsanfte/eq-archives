 All I have to say to that is "BS". Monks do fine with 2 handers like
Imbued Fighters Staff, Peacebringer and the Trorsmang Bo stick. For one
thing don't assume every monk out there has a pair of primal/priceless.
I can guarantee you they don't.

 Basically I have a hard time hearing things like this from people that
don't play a high end monk. I play my monk day in and day out. Depending
on what I am doing a 2hb is my usual weapon of choice. I can guarantee
you I am not doing "40-60% less damage".

 Thanks for playing though.
