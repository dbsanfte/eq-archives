I -just- made a few of those, hadn't sold any yet, though.

It's not as bad as it seems - they added a vendor in PoK that sells mana
batteries, and you can get a collapsible toolbox to recharge with.  Class 1
mana bateries sell for 10.5pp.  Each battery gets you 400 bandages.  So one
stack of mana batteries gets you 8000 bandages for 210pp, and it only takes
3 slots to hold them.  This is roughly half the price of store-bought
bandages.

But it's still a pretty harsh nerf of a really useful item that didn't
really do anything except reduce the number of trips back to town you'd have
to make.
