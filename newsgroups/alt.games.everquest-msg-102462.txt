Depends.

"/petition Hey I think the boats are still broken, can I get an
airlift to Qeynos?" -guide answers when he can and summons them to
qeynos

"/petition damn u f***kers suk fix the dam boats NOW!!!11!!!!1! I ben
siting heer at the f***king dock 4 20 min and the dum shuttle hasnt
moved!!!11!!1!" - guide waits until they are in Freeport and then
summons them to Qeynos with no warning

It's so simple but so many people don't get it - if you want help from
someone: no matter how much you think you deserve it, don't treat
those in position to help you like shit.
