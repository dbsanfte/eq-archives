And the problem with this is what exactly? People xp hunting these
goblins will leave the Blade of Nobility on the corpse to rot. Any
pally that's trying to get a Ghoulbane has but to ask for the person
hunting them to send them a tell when a blade drops. Sure, you might
run into someone being an ass about it, but chances of that are slim.

I've been playing since well before the Ghoulbane quest went in. I
don't remember ever seeing multiple Crazed Goblen camps... I've never
seen Verant remove a camp because too many people were hunting it...
