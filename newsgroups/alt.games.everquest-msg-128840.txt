Interesting situations come up all the time where you'll get a "weird"
puller combination.

Last night we had people in skyfire hanging out and grinding xp and
looking for spells and hoping for Rage to spawn. Our group was sort of
an ad-hoc "whoever showed up next" group that turned out to be all
casters. 48 wizzie, 48 necro, 54 chanter, 52 druid, 60 mage, 60 cleric.

The mage pulled all night. Did an amazing job, too. It was a freaky
group. No tanks (the pets were just dots), fear kiting everything, me
and the druid snaring, the necro and the cleric fearing, if people
started getting LOM the mage paused between pulls to rain mod rods down
on the ground all over and the cleric healed us up from mod rodding
while the mage ran out to pull more. Pretty non-stop action. In a couple
of hours I got a yellow and a half of xp. About twenty spells dropped,
and of course ZERO of them were wizard spells. Had to camp when I was
less than a blue from dinging 49 and getting Ice Comet. I almost cried.
