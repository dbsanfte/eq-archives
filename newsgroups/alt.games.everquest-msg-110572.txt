/sigh...this is SO not worth much time here, but I can't resist. You
ARE begging. Anyone who doesn't think this is begging is an IDIOT,
plain and simple. From the sound of it, you have acquired most of what
you have through begging.

Understand, the majority of the players frown upon begging. It makes
for a lazy individual and a poorly-skilled group member.

Go away.
