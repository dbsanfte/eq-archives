I thought initially it was a sort of "help" for the casting classes. Some
extended time to test the newly gotten spells a level before so to say.
Usually by the time I leave a hell level I am pretty sure of the
capabilities of my new spells (and pets in my case).

Also, whenever I have about 1 yellow in hell, I tend to start doing some
quests. Deaths only seem to take a small portion of your exp so I don't
worry about it too much.
