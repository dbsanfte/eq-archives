Ya know, I hear of these people.  I even know of a few.  How do they manage
to end up in your groups?  They certainly don't end up in mine.  :)

Not that I won't invite random people into groups, or accept invitations
into random groups, but the people that would be *so* clueless as to make
the magician a better puller than the monk are well known on my server.  Are
there *so* many that are that clueless on your server that you don't know
the true idiots before you group with them?
