200 pages? Ouch.

This is what I like about being permitted to work more informally. My
co-workers who are doing large system implementations must, of course,
do serious docs, but so far my work has usually been of the "Here's a
problem, write a solution." or "The client wants something we don't
understand, and neither do they. Go write it." variety.

Pretty sure the period placement in that paragraph wouldn't have met
the approval of any of my old English teachers. A side effect of
programming, no doubt.

Again, ouch.

Yeah, I've kind of noticed that. In my Day Job I can just call my boss
and say "that's out of scope" and let him deal with the politics. In
my side business I'm having to learn how to say "no".
