    Price has dropped radically due to the LDoN ID IV belt from Tak, which
is currently selling for as low as 18 K and rarely above 25 K. Stats are
better on the Burner, but the belt goes in what is traditionally a weak slot
for casters anyways. Someone with a solid ranged item won't get as much of a
boost from the Burner (since PRI and SEC are easy to fill).

    No, my guild is Lotus Cult - www.lotuscult.org - but Silent Redemption
has one of the best loot databases out there. I prefer it to the one at
Afterlife's site, especially because the SR one explicitly says how many of
each item have dropped for them. That gives you a clue about the
distribution, and helps you to plan a gear progression.
