That is too hard on my monitor. The click and snap of changing
resolutions makes me cringe.

I don't have the best set of eyes. Since I play full screen all of the
time (except when medding), I set the colors to stand out agains the
semi-transparent chat window. The colors have to be very bright and
lighter shades in order to contrast with the darker semi-transparent
chat window. This makes them nearly invisible in "BOOK" mode.

I put in paren "except for specific tactics" to address the
differences between lower levels and higher levels (ie your point
about meleeing your Dru till 20)

You didn't address my point. 

Removing the "BOOK" view does not give a lower level player an
advantage when leveling.  The only advantage that losing the "BOOK"
gives is the ability to watch the action while medding. You would
still have to med just as long. So the "sitting on your ass time"
remains constant, but at least you would be able to see what the hell
is going on around you.

For me it isn't trivial. It causes eye-strain and discomfort. Further
it actually makes to harder to Role-Play and immerse yourself in the
game. 

It's like watching 4 hour movie (Like Ghandi, or Saving Private Ryan)
and then having the "INTERMISSION" screen come up when it is time to
change the reels or tapes.
