No I had not hailed the drake at PoF entrance. Prior to doing so 'unlock
memories' resulted in the message - 'Besting the Burning Prince proves your
might, but you must still prove your warrior's spirit' (doh - i am necro) -
and nothing relating to Sol Ro appeared with 'Guided Meditation'. On hailing
the drake and getting pre-flag 'Guided Mediation' now results in the
message - 'The portal into the plane of Fire has been altered. Miak needs
you to find the correct way to channel the portal. The power of Dresolik
surges through you.' (wtf does all that mean - due respect to person who
figured out these darn quests the first time around). 'Unlock memories'
still results in the 'Besting the Burning Prince blah blah...' message. Who
is Dresolik BTW?

Ok I assume this means all is well in terms of that flag. 'The portal' she
is talking about - is that the one that you take from SolRo tower in to
PoFire?

TIA and thanks for responses
