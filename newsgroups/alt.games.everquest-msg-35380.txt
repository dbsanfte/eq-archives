I keep meaning to try it, but I haven't had a chance yet.  I can say that it
does not crash when I go back into EQ, but I still had a different desktop
resolution on the several occasions when this occurred, and was unable to
see anything in EQ.  EQ still responded to my keystrokes, I could let people
know I was going to go LD, or that I was camping, and why, but I could see
nothing.
