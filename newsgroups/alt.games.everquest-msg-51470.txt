You got that right about pet classes... I think that in fact they would 
have a much easier time than even Wizards, since all they would need is to 
kill enough things for a Malachite or a couple of bone chips. After that, 
they would be a devastating force of nature for all things green... They 
wouldn't even need to worry about any INT gear for a long time.
