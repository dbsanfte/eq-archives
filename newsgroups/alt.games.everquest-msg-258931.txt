Just a wild guess here... but I take it your not speaking from experience
here right?
Your not in the forefront of expansions, battling new unmapped unspoilered
content, so how do you know what, if any, purpose it serves?

Do you even raid, lol? At any level?  The reasons may not be very compelling
to you, but take it from somebody who is at the forefront, there are very
real reasons.

Of course i could just be an elitist immature dick who plays to win because
of a low self esteem and lack of friends, like all the other "hardcore"
raiders, right!

Yes it does.  Maybe not every single fight, as there are some very difficult
encounters in GoD.. but its down to execution.  Even with a working strat,
you can still lose in the future if your execution is sloppy.

GoD is very different to any previous expansions raiding content.  A lot of
it is very non-obvious tricks, which once learnt you will probably never
lose again, but learning of those particular tricks and nonstandard mobs can
be a very time consuming and difficult encounter.

SOE's code changes for cockblocking and such arent exactly implemented with
much thought to what else it fucks up though....
They removed cockblocking somewhat in GoD by allowing any (flagged) guild
into the final candy land zone, after just 1 guild has killed the big bad
gatekeeper mob blowing the entry.   Sure it stops cockblocks, but the whole
point of the "final" zone in each expansion has typically been a loot-laden
reward zone for all the shit and progression to get there... now you don't
need to win yourself, just let the guild above you win and follow them in!

Whys that?

Engage the mob, look what he does, find out the AE's and melee damage,
abilities, adds etc, read emotes.. etc etc.. if you wipe, so what?
Death in EQ is hardly a significant thing, you just CR your raid and go
again, with the info and awareness you gained from the first trial and error
run.
