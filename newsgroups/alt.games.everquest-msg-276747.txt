IIRC there were two SOE reps involved, Brad and somebody at/near
the top of the GM heirarchy, so, yeah, a bit higher up than your
garden variety CSR.  I sure don't recall any clear acknowledgement,
and I read the stuff a couple times, but you could be right (it has
been a while), or maybe there was something weasel-worded that gave
the appearance of agreeing without actually doing so.  Likely as
not neither of them actually knew, given that it was very apparent
from the correspondence that SOE didn't understand just how or what
the Conquest people were doing.

*shrug* Pathing exploits aren't innovative.  Whatever they were doing
beyond the pathing exploit was (apparently) not at all understood by
SOE and (to my knowledge) never revealed by the people in the know.
I think you're pretty well right about highend raiding though, guilds
like Conquest aren't playing EQ, or WoW, or whatever.  They play a
much different game, a game without a name (afaik), a game that pits
their team against the developer team for "teh win", with all the
thousands of other players viewed as nothing more than unimportant
bits of scenery.
