   That's what I _want_ you to think!  Mua-ha-ha!

  Haven't spent much time in the Paladral Caverns, then?

    I was there for a couple of nights a short while ago when PL'ving
Lenny, and it was *hilarious*.

Names and exact words approximated since I don't have the logs.  The
following was all in /shout.

Joebob: Bandit 1 LF tank, PST

JimJack: Bandit 1 does NOT need a tank, don't send tells!

Billyjim: Bandit 1 looking for a party leader that isn't a jerk!

Joebob:  Bandit 1 looking for a tank and party leader, PST.

Jimjack: FUCK YOU!  Duel me, cocksucker!

A minute passes.

Jimjack:  WTF?  Stop evading!  Backstabbing is so gay!  STAND STILL!

Joebob:  Um, you DID know he was rogue when you challenged him, right?

Jimjack:  FUCK YOU!  You next!

Joebob:  You going to bitch when I use my pet, genius?


And so on, for hours.  No, I take that back.  It went on for both nights
we where there, with pretty much the same players.
