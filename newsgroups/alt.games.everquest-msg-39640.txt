Okay I can see that being an issue for bards, but even they shouldn't have
problems, with invis songs.  I always asked for my rogue to be bound in Ogguk
when fighting in Cazic Thule, and lazy person that I am, I still haven't gone
and gotten my mask at level 41.  I will think about doing it, and then someone
will say, lets go fight Ice giants in Halas, or lets head to Velious, or some
other request to head else where.  I never seem to be in the area long enough to
pop my head in and snag one.  Sneak, hide, walk past the guards, nbd.  Granted I
couldn't bank, but I could sell to the merchants in Feerrott.
