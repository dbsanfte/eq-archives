Yes that's my situation exactly, in my case it was from 39,000 points to
1,700. I'd say roughly 1/3 of the gear I had turned in I would like to have
back now, though none of it is a heartbreaking loss.

I am surprised by the degree of nerfage for non-foraged non-crafted turnins.
If their goal is a cost ratio of 1 tp = 1 pp then I think they overshot, the
items I turned in were worth in total....hmm, maybe twice the 1,700 tribute
points I am now left with, at current bazaar prices in plat.
