It's an interesting theory.  Assume this:  They have a certain number of  
dollars to invest in making trucks.  If they spend some on V6's and some 
on V8's, they will make slightly fewer trucks total than if they just make 
one or the other, because they have to pay to set up and maintain two 
parallel production processes, rather than just one.  Assume that, by only 
having one style (V8, say) they can make 5% more trucks than otherwise, 
and have 5% of their capital left.  Now, suppose they spend that 5% left 
over on advertising, to convince us that we all really wanted V8's anyway?  
Net result, they spend the same amount of money, and sell 5% more trucks.

Won't their boss be proud.

Perhaps our opinion is bought more cheaply than a parallel production 
process?  I can't say, not having any real numbers.  But Lance's data on 
the unavailability of the V6 leans me toward believing that.

And that's not even with speculating about the value of the kickback from 
the oil companies for making more gas guzzlers instead of those pesky 
V6's... </deependconspiracytheory> :)
