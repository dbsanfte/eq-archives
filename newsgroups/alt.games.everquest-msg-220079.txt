I stuck with it, despite it being fairly weak at first, and it
certainly did get much better.  Getting rid of Mr. I screw up and
almost destroy the universe but then solve everything after the
interesting people run around for most of the hour helped a lot
of course.

Funny thing is, in the end I'd rather be Wesley than Riker, it
wasn't Wesley's fault being the best and the brightest (he didn't
even exercise), but Riker was a smirking kirk wanabee from the
beginning and never got any better; he did only one thing right
and that was grow a beard... but thats only really fun if you
read the book where it happened, in the show it was just not
there one season and there the next.  Oh wait, he also said "one
at a time or both at once".  Same episode where I got to enjoy
him eating Gaak as it is best enjoyed.

24 looks to me like another show I'd actually have to watch. 
What I need are shows like half of the X Files or most of TNG; if
you know the basic setup and major characters, each episode
pretty much stands on its own.  Whoever invented shows where the
story arc matters more than the individual episode's events
should be taken out and shot.  No not really, thats fine if you
work a nine to five and don't have kids... but it doesnt' fit
into my life at all.

This new trend of DVD releases of entire seasons of shows might
reverse my opinion of that, though, if they get cheap enough or I
get rich enough.
