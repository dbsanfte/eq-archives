A while ago i posted someone about how levellling slowed for me at 35 
and someone mention it gets worse etc saying it can take a week to gain 
a level in the 50s
With that in my how the hell can someone on my server have gotten from 
60-65 in the week that pop has been out
Surely they must have used some sort of exploit to get there so quick?
