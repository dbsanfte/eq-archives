I'm thinking that Jerimiah and Richard probably have the right of it.
I'll dare to guess that your over zealous enchanter is a much better
spell caster than my char in terms of game mechanics (L60 pure caster
vs. L52 hybrid), which I would expect to lead to fewer resists by the
spell effects he's trying to remove and thus less random seeming
results.
