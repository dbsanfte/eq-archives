Let's see... the Nazi party militarized, in direct violation of the treaty
ending the First (half of the) World War.  They violatied a treaty with the
Soviet Union.  They made a dang good start of destroying the Jewish people.
They compromised elections to get party members into the parliament.  What
in that list suggests even followin the rules, let alone being "a slave to
the rules, and isnists everyone sticking to the rules?"

Their "jackbooted" reputation is from the fact that National Socialism is a
statist form of government, just the same as Fascism and Communism.
Granted, comparing them to Stalin or Chariman Mao would be even worse than
calling them Nazis, since the Bolshevik Revolution, and the chinese Cultural
Revolution were both bloodier than the Holocaust.

Let's see.... Judas betrayed Jesus.  Hmm, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
betrayed the people of the United States.  Direct parallel confirmed.

Hitler killed millions of Jews.  Lorkai has killed now Jews that we know of,
but has probably slaughtered countless gnolls.  I guess we have a
arallel.  -_-
