There may be a good portion of the mother's stupidity here as well. 
Let's see
1) The kid is not very stable
2) The kid really likes this game, and can't control the time he spends

3) She gives him shit for spending time on his computer. I'm almost 
willing to bet she'd threaten him with taking his games away every now 
and then
4) Hmm, take a toy from a person with unstable behavior, especially with 
features of depression
