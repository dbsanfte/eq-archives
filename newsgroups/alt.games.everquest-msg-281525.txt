He tells you what he really wants, what he wants and what he'll accept and
what he doesn't want.
They are from 4 points to 0 in value.
Some drops are more common than others...detailed post on:
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=quest&message.
id=84711
Basically from highest drop to lowest is:

Candied Cadavers
Gummy Spiders
Marshmellow Ghosts
Choclate Goblins

You can turn in and get zero score until he gives you the quest closests to
the cadaver/spider/ghost order.

good luck!
