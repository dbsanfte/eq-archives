If by that you're asking do I think it's unbreakable, no, not at all.
But that applies to all password encryption technology.

Do I think it's worth someone breaking (in terms of reward vs effort)?
Again, no, not at all.

The whole "stealing accounts by grabbing packets, decrypting
passwords, and what-not" concept is very compelling sounding,
especially at first blush...

However, the question that you really have to ask is "How often is it
happening?" Personally, I can't recall hearing about a single case of
it this year, and I couldn't say for sure that I'd ever heard of it
happening before. Don't you think that if it was as easy (and
apparently prevalent) as some are claiming, that we'd be hearing about
it fairly often?

Despite what some people might have us believe about what could
happen, I find it a lot more instructive to look at what *has*
happened, and what *is* happening.

Hence my use of the phrase "vanishingly few."


Anecdote - shortly before Verant announced this new policy a guild
mate of mine had his account 'commandeered'. He logged on one day to
discover that everything his character had (including no-drop items,
which is just plain malicious) had been stripped. He swore that he'd
never shared his password, etc. After investigation, the GMs
discovered who had robbed him - it was a 'friend' of his.

The 'friend' hadn't used any high-tech trickery - my guild mate had
simply been stupid.
