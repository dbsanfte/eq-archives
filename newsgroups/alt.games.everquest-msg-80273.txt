Sadly you tend to know if somebody has spawned the Dark Reaver because
most of the time the druid has left via Wc and the Reaver is on a
killing spree near the WC zoneline were all the travelers headed for
FP or HHP pass through.

I was running my level 9 shaman to Fp one day following behind to
other players of about the same level doing the same when as I
approached the WC zoneline I noticed all the bodies (including the two
who I was behind) laying on the ground and what looked like a naked DE
players standing there. As I got closer he turned on me, whacked me
for almost all my health, but being SOW'd I made it to the line
barely. I felt so bad for the two who were bound in Qeynos that I log
my 50ish (at the time) druid ran him to Qeynos, picked them up, and
ran them out to their bodies, making sure he wasn't there. Would have
been a crime if they had lost their items because somebody else
"quest" MoB creamed them. Reaver needs a depop code.
