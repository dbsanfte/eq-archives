| Is there a master list out there (hopefully on a forum or site) that
| lists zones with their corresponding XP bonuses? I've only been able
| to dig up this:
|
| Droga increased by 12%
| Nurga increased by 12%
| Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13%
| Najena increased by 13%
| Befallen increased by 13%
| Paw increased by 13%
| Permafrost increased by 13%
| Kaesora increased by 18%
| Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20%
| Runnyeye increased by 20%
| Kerra Ridge increased by 20%
| The Hole increased by 25%
|
|
| But these are only the increases SoE has made and not the actual
| values themselves (unless these were given the standard bonus prior to
| this upgrade).
|
| Thanks.
