Just got a confirmation from moorgard:  You can neither invite nor disband
people from a group or raid when they are in a locked encounter.

So don't arrive late to raids, and you can't go to bed until the monsters
are dead. ^_^  And as we were discussing earlier, this also means no PLing
by having a high level friend in the group who disbands before xp is
awarded.
