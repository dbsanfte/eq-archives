a fellow on my server is kind "the EPIC guy" as he runs the scheduling for
90% of the epics done in his guild and the 3 other guilds that are allied
with him

dealing with the shaman epic specifically, i can tell you for a fact his
faction was just right to do several mq's and get lots of other people their
epics (myself included on the mq, twice)

no problems either

max faction being the problem is complete bullshit

pirg, good luck camping the final piece of your epic: the trustworthy
employee of sony
