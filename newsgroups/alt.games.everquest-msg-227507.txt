Beyond fixing the exploits, I wish SOE would just stop at tracking down the
accounts that most obviously abused the xp/pp exploits and banning them.  It
could be the hippie in me coming back, but the idea of rollbacks, extensive
transaction tracing (what if someone bought something from my vendor and I
then used that money to buy something from another vendor who used that
money to buy something from another vendor, etc.) and whatever else might be
imagined scares me.   Not so much from the ideal of "making things whole",
but from a practicality standpoint.  The resources would be huge and there
would doubtless be innocents who get trampled in the process.
