Yes. Most of my level 30ish characters in EQ had about 3 days /played. 
So yes, levelling in DAOC is slower, at least so far. If I remember 
correctly, in a good group, my monk would get about a bubble per hour in 
his high 40ies. In DAOC it's slower, and it's more difficult to 
powerlevel people

Ah, now you hit the nail on the head. Less downtime, yes, less travel 
time, yes, feeling of progress, yes. Faster levelling? No.
You can have no downtime, but you will still need more kills to level
