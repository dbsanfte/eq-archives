That's just inaccurate.  There are many skills that don't require a
successful skill check to go up.  All tradeskills are like this.  So are
melee skills like double attack, dodge, riposte, etc.  Pay attention to
those skills when you first train them and your skill is still very low and
you will see what I mean.

While it's true that for some skills you have to actually succeed on it to
receive a skill increase (you can't very well get a point of conjuration
without using a spell of that school and there are no skill increases for a
fizzle), it just isn't the case for the kind of skills you're talking about
here.
