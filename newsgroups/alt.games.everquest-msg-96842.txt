So tell me...  At what point...  Where you said your Druid is a Level 10,
and you state that your Halfling druid you run does not have his book open
and 'meditate' works for him at level 3.

Hello, McFly...  At low levels, your mana pool is going to be small.  It
replenishes at a fixed rate.  As your mana pool goes up, which it does,
when you increase in level, wear gear with more Wis, or Gear that gives you
more mana...  The fixed rate in which you gain mana will be too slow for
your higher level spells that uses, *gasp* larger amounts of mana compared
to your low level spells.

Do this sometime...  Cast one of your 9th level spells and compare the
amount of mana you used for it to one of your first level equivalent
spells.  You will noticed that it uses MORE mana than your first level
spell.  Then think back...  Back when you were 1...  How much mana it cost
you to get that spell up.  When you do, get back to us.
