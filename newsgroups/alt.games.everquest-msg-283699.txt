I tend to park my pet when travelling through zones.  That way, if
something does happen to tag me, Goner isn't right there to try and
help me out and I don't lose him if I decide to drop aggro with FD.

When I'm camping a spot, I tend to park Goner just a bit away from
where I intend to fight.  That way if I need to FD split, I can still
wail on the Pet BACK THE F*CK OFF key before he gets in there and on
the hate list.
