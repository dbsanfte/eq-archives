Unless I totally misunderstand what it is you're trying to say, this is
incorrect. We were under the same misconception and tested it. Go to a
safe spot with various structures to use as landmarks. (Building edges,
other structures). Go to the windowed mode and find the spots right on
the very edge of your screen at left, right, top bottom. Marke them
well.

Now, switch to half/full screen mode with F10. You have *exactly* the
same amount of the EQ world visible to you. The screen ends at *exactly*
the same spots. It's just bigger. I don't mind it being smaller if I can
read the text, which is pretty critical.
