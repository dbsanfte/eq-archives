Lack of discouragement does not equate with encouragement, and Sony's
customers aren't interested because there is no practical point
whatsoever to roleplaying.  Sony gives the game various fantasy
religions and diverse fantasy races, but it is mere lip service
towards role-playing.  It's a waste of time, because anyone gets to
group with anyone without any penalties - Dark Elf Necro with Elf
Paladin, hey no problem with that!  I have long thought of EQ as a
first-person "hack-and-slash" that has chat facilities: it has never,
ever been a role-playing game, despite supposedly being one.
