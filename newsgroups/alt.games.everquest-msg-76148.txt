I agree the FV catches bother me also.  You use the lures the same as you do
bait, the key is to make sure that your lures are used before your bait or
vice versa.  Just whichever container you have your lures/bait in place the
lures in the top slot of the container/inventory.

On the bonus... VI, I believe around the 20 DEC 2001 patch announced the
bonus, however since skill bonus are not reflected on the Item detail screen
you wont see the actual bonus.  It would be nice to see the bonus though (I
have seen a difference in how often I catch fish and the rare catches).

And yes you lose lures just like bait.  I never sell my lures to vendors
because the stuff you catch sells for much more.  granted your can about 5 -
10pp worth of junk/fish in about an hour (in Freeport), this is after you
have established a pure profit stage.
