Oh... you know, as I said, I am not a "hardcore gamer", I am 
typically the *very* casual gamer, one week when I have enough 
time, then staying 2 weeks far from the keyboard, then able again 
to play one or two couple of hours in the night... this type of 
gamer... :Z
I do believe you when I read that raising my 1H Slash skill for 
Dual Weild would be fine, but u may guess now that it is a hard 
goal for myself.

Though I will try during one or two levels, I will perhaps get some 
surprising results ?

Oh yeah I had forgotten to write that I do NOT have Luclin, mainly 
because of the weakness of my computer. So I cannot access to the 
Bazaar. I wonder that I would already own a better 2-hand slashing 
weapon w/ this extension. :(-
