I've seen a hell of a lot more druids willing to be primary healer than
shaman, but that's irrelevant too.

There are so few times where a druid would have to choose between healing
RIGHT NOW and snaring RIGHT NOW that I could say that it NEVER HAPPENS and
be damned close to being 100% correct.

Next?

And it's not irrelevant that I have a 52 druid.  It's relevant because *I*
know what I'm talking about.  You haven't shown any evidence that you do.
