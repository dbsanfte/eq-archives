Fair enough.

My issue with the naming convention is not that I care about any 
particular name in the server, but the general lack of keeping with the 
fantasy environment. This is not something that can be fixed if most 
people don't see it as a problem, obviously, but I can't help it if I do, 
since I was sold into this game with the pretense of it being a Fantasy 
RPG, not a turn-based Quake.

Obviously, it appears that spot enforcement by GMs does not work at all, 
so my preferred solution for EQ2 would be to force players to use the 
Random Fantasy Name Generator. It's not very good, but for my taste, 
it's better than the current situation.
