I started a Halfling Druid not long ago. I was surprised when I walked
past a wolf and it didn't aggro me (I've never been a druid, and I
didn't know about this bonus). I didn't attack animals like bears and
wolves. I didn't attack anything that didn't attack me first, just to
be sure. Well, one day I forgot what character I was playing, and I
attacked a bear. I realized what I did, and I decided to let it kill
me, just to be safe. Well, when it was about to kill me, a high level
guy came along and killed it, thinking he was doing me a favor by
helping me survive. Now I am no longer safe around animals. They aggro
on me just like I was one of the other classes. Is there any way to
regain the "faction" I lost with the animals and make it so I can
safely hunt around them without worrying about getting attacked?
Thanks.
