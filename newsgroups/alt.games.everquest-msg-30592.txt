You entered this thread by flaming the original poster, you moron.

Infrequently?  ROFL.

Now there's a big suprise.

I have news for you, sunshine.  No one really gives a flaming shit if you
want to be yourself or not.  You bring your blueblooded ass here and flame
away with your very first post in this thread and you expect everyone to
just welcome you with open arms and swap spit with you.  Face it, you spewed
off and got shit shoved right back in your face, yet while "enlightening"
all of us about our ignorance, you pour out nothing but utter stupidity with
each word you type.  No one cares about your self admitted alchohol problem,
no one gives a shit about your lineage, and no one is interested in your
intelligence. Go try and impress someone else, because you are doing a
pretty crappy job of it here.
