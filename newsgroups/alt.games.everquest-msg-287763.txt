I'm playing some LOTRO as well, and there are certainly some aspects of it
I enjoy more than similar aspects of EQ.  But in many ways I prefer EQ.

Mostly I play LOTRO to game with my wife (and sometimes other friends), who
otherwise mostly plays WOW and COH.  Which means it really REALLY sucks when
LOTRO makes some quests mandatory that (a) can only be done solo and (b) are
the LOTRO equivalent of an EQ monster mission, i.e. you take on the role of
some NPC.  So there I am, not playing the character I'm used to and like to
play, not playing with my wife, can't even use in-game chat to talk with her
in Kinship chat because the monster session means my own character is "logged
out".

But that's an exception; mostly it's plenty fun roaming Middle Earth, and the
graphics are awesome without grinding my machine to a halt like Vanguard did.
But LOTRO has its own daily quests and faction grinds, just like EQ, and I
frankly don't have the time or patience to do that in more than one place, so
most of my play is still in EQ.
