Stay lurking then.  While, yes... Her 21 year old son's death is a
tragedy...  If you READ her statements in the article at hand...  It points
a fact that she didn't do much to help her son in the problem either.  Her
'need' to put on a warning sign on the box is partly her lawyer trying to
milk the situation.

At this point...  Ridiculing her about it is fair game if she or her lawyer
thinks her son's problems were game related to begin with.  Besides, I'm
not the artist of the /gu comic, or the person who thought up of the comic,
but I am sure some people here haven't seen it either, and probably would
find it funny as well after hearing 'her' story.
