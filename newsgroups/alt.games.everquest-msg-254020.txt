Agreed at that level, but toss in some anemic nukes too, and spot heals 
as needed.

Correct, and they do stack.

You are quite wrong about what a shaman can and will do in later levels 
in groups. Your job will be to buff, debuff (malo line, slows, cripple 
sometimes), heal, cause damage to mobs (primarilly DoTs on mobs that will 
be standing long enough).

I have often been the sole healer in a group of 2 to 6 people, including 
fighting in BoT.  Sometimes you will have to do ghetto crowd control by 
rooting mobs off, or even keep one occupied pounding on you while you 
heal yourself.  It's very situational, and depends who else is in your 
group.  In addition to that, you can solo quite well at all levels, not 
as well as the best solo clases in terms of xp gain though.
