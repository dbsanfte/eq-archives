As a lot of you have pointed out it does not really help for not hacking the
program, so i really think verant should be a little more nice with this..

Mail and such is no problem, cos i have a laptop besides me, and have all
acess there, but what REALLY bothers me, is things like antivirus, and other
"popup" programs.. Yes.. if they are popping up with something, you will go
LD, and bibi eq..

Not really kewl.. (as this has happened a couple of times to me..)
