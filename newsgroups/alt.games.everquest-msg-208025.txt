Since when has thread drift been politically incorrect here?
Besides, as you pointed out, the strategy for a pure-solo Druid
is straight-forward and the tactics are generally obvious.  And
if he can't infer from my posts (which his follow-up questions
show he is reading) that I prefer grouping to solo play, well,
that really needs no further comment.  Oh, btw, don't get me
wrong here.  I'm not intending to tell you how you should play,
just telling you what I think is good about how I play.  If you
like playing a pure-solo Druid, even to the extreme of taking on
the role of "ersatz robe caster", then go for it.  It's not as
if I can decide what is and what isn't fun for you.
