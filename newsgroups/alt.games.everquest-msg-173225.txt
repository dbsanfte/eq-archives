A question for you:
How is your particular brand of TheOneAndOnlyTrueAnswer(tm) in
any way more valid than anybody else's.  I've yet to see any
convincing evidence that any particular major event in human
history occurred when and how it did because of any single
cause.  Even "economics" is way the hell more complicated than
that.

must... resist... aarrggghhhh!
Please tell me that you didn't give any significant thought to that
particular sentence in your post.  I mean, whose history books?
which edition?

And your proof of this is?  Don't forget, you must clearly demonstrate
how this particular event (the occupation of Poland) stands alone as
the sole impetus for the UK entering the War (you did say "only").
It is not sufficient to demonstrate the obvious, that the occupation
of Poland was the catalyst (or trigger, or whatever other synonym you
care to use) for their entry, that would not support your claim.

<snip the remaining simplistic speculation presented as if it were fact>


So, are we to take it that your position on the whole matter can be
summed up as:  "my favorite brand of grotesquely over-simplified
propaganda is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
while everybody else's is nothing but lies"?
