I own a mobile home and was there when he installed it.  All he did outside
was run a line from the green box sitting on the ground to the side of my
house and stick a 2-port splitter (well, one in, 2 out).  One goes to my
living room, one to my computer room.

I wouldn't pay anyone to install anything like an amplifier if it simply
goes between the Cable In and the two-way splitter...it's not like it's
rocket science. :)

OK, I have to go get a digital box anyway, I'll see what RR sells and go out
& buy one for myself to avoid the installation cost.  Thanks!
