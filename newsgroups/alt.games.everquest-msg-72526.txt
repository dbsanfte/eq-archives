PC100 & PC133 are clock speeds for the memory.  PC100 is 100Mhz ram, while
PC133 would be 133Mhz ram.

DIMM = Dual Inline Memory Module.

There is a HUGE difference between Sdram & Rdram.  Sdram is Synchronous & I
forget the the "d" stands for.  Rdram, if I am not mistaken, is Rambus Ram.
Rambus Ram, in most people's opinions (mine included), is inferior to Sdram.
Rdram is more expensive than Sdram, partly because they have to put
heatsinks on the memory & the memory performs more poorly than Sdram does
(this is what I have read in reviews).

Rambus is a "think tank" that came up with this "great idea" for better ram.
They got Intel to get on their bandwagon & tried to shove it on everyone.
Looks like DDR ram (double data rate) will be the new standard as regular
Sdram is eventually phased out.  That will take forever tho because you have
to wait for everyone to buy a new computer that has a DDR motherboard.

Hope that helps some & sorry if you are stuck with Rdram.
