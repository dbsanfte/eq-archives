    Tunare is apparently a bad place to be. ;-) 2 K was very cheap for my
server. After another guild finally got into CoD, the price oddly went UP to
8 K minimum for one. The night I saw that, I put one on my mule that had
been barely able to move hers at 2 K, and priced it at 4 K - and it was
snapped up. I think some people might be doing their first Bazaar searches
with the price filter set high, so they never saw my Mace when it was at 2 K
but did see Maces when they ranged from 8 to 30 K.

    Anytime I've done XP at zone-in, at least half the group has come away
with a Mace. Draw your own conclusions about commonality. If it didn't have
a level limit, every paladin from level 10 up would own one.
