>>> Just got off work, read that the servers were down all morning. it's
1:42, I can't get in.. they still down or is it just me this time =0). <<<

At the time of your post, only one server is down, but it's kinda an
important one........

the log in server went down at 9:00 PST, they say approx two hours. They put
in a message that if you were currently on, try to stay on for that period
of time, since you won't be able to get back on.

Which was my plan, till I went LD.
