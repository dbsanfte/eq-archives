Make sure you are using say.  I have heard quest messages spoken in
group and ooc, but the messages only work when using say.  Since I
usually use groupsay, I have a habit of typing "/say " before I speak
to an npc.  Also, some npcs will ignore what you say if you are
invisible; not likely since you are a paladin, but thought I should
mention it.
