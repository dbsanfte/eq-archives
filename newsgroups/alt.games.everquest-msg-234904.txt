Gads, what happened to my killfile?  Uber used to be on it... did you change
ISPs or something?

Scott - Please consider Uber to be at best a source of how NOT to play
Everquest.  He's a board troll who comes here to piss people off and stir up
controversy.  Don't consider the above to be a good example of wizard play;
he's purposely outlining everything NOT to do in order to piss people off.

I'm putting him back on killfile, and would suggest you do the same

Rhian,
65 wizard
