There are plenty of legitimate reasons why someone can't log in for an
extended period, and not all of them will you have a warning for. This
is just making it so people aren't punished in-game when they are able
to return for RL issues. Sorry, I still say calling it "dumbing down"
the game is nothing but bullshit whining. It won't really apply to all
that many people, and those it will apply to, it usually applies for
damn good reasons.
