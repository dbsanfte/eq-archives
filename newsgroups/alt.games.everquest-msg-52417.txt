Forgive me if I stop reading here.  This is all I need to know that this
does not apply to my example.  If a person twinks his character, he isn't
harming your gaming experience in any way resembling your example above,
whether that twink came from an eBay purchase or from a higher level
character.  This scenario is completely invalid and in no way supports your
argument or discredits mine.

Best Regards
