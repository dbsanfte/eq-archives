 Iksar Master is fine where he is. What we'd really prefer to see is
Faydedars pathing changed so that they don't start fighting to begin
with. Of course, that's too simple for Verant. 

 This is similar to Kwinn in Firiona Vie. He used to be kos to all the
mobs so he'd be killed rather fast, meaning it was hard to do the quest.
Eventually Verant caved in and made him not-kos to the other mobs so you
can actually find Kwinn up at times now.

 I'll have to try that. I have root items. I'll feign and see if they go
back to what they were doing when it wears off.
