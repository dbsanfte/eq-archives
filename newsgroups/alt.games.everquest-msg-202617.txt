No, my opinions are my own.  Your opinions are just those ... yours.

The difference is that when I decide to plop down my money to be in their
world, I accept that it's their world.  And I understand that I have the
freedom to leave their world any time I like.

Many have tried.  You either choose not to see it, or can't quite grasp it.
Either way, there's no sense in re-hashing it.

Perhaps if I were to have gotten a KEI on my level 18 necro, gone to the SK
spire that your group was sitting on, and started chain-pulling gnolls out
from under you, you'd get it.

No, probably not.  You'd just tuck your tail and run off, spending another
hour trying to find a good spot that wasn't already taken.  Norrath's a big
place, right?

Nope.  I don't resent a bit those who have gone on into their 60's without
having to deal with Hell Levels like I did.  Nor those who got there never
knowing what it was like to stare at a spellbook until 35.  Nor those who
got from 1 -10 without having to deal with CRs.

What I don't care for, frankly, is someone who doesn't have the balls to
deal with a change without putting out a whiny "This is going to ruin me
because I'm an older player with no time" post.  Probably because I'm an
older player and have no time as well, but I deal with it.  This game isn't
an entitlement ... no one here owes you a damn thing.

Start a warrior and shut up.  Hell, even better for you ... start a warrior
on the Test Server.  Not only do you have no mana issues, but you can enter
a command and zip right to 20 with a full set of gear!

I'll be damned.  You almost made through a whole post without resorting to
some kind of insult.  You just don't have it in you, do you?
