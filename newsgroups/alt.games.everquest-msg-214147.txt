Oh wait, you aren't being fair here.  I could with relatively crappy equivalent
get more exp per hour than I could grouped... depending on the group.  While 90%
of groups were better than my best soloing efforts by a long shot, there -were-
groups that weren't better.  So a cleric who could show that -some- group was
better than mr. ubercleric isn't enough to prove that soloing isn't better than
-some- group.

And I will go further out on a limb than that.  While some of my soloing carreer
was due to sheer orneriness, most of it was simply because in my situation, solo
worked better.  Solo means no time wasted finding a group, no time wasted
getting the group together, no time wasted when someone has to run to a bank to
get some piece of gear, no time wasted buffing everyone up and waiting for mana
to regen, no time wasted when some key person has to go on an extended AFK, or
LD's, or... well groups suck down a lot of time not getting exp sometimes.  If
you can only play in short stretches, but can log out all ready to go in an exp
area, then a solo character has an advantage; you log on, start killing, play
till you have to log off, and get back in your safe spot and go back to sleep.
99% of your play time is spent getting exp/loot/faction, instead of a healthy
chunk of it being wasted on incedental group activities... if you can find a
group at all thats interested in you if you can only be on a short time.  This
math works less well for mages, who have significant down time caused by logging
out; pet dies, equipment vanishes, its ugly.

Plus specifically as a cleric, combat tends to come in little chunks with
significant down time in between.  If you have chores to do and can sit down and
play for a minute or two, then go be AFK for five minutes, then repeat... well
you can argue that your play time is a continuous string of kills, because the
afk time isn't play time.  This was my situation, I had a lot of stuff to do IRL
but could afford to leaven my chores with periodic EQ killing.  What group would
tolerate such behavior, though?  I should probably explore a wizard, who's
killing pattern seems to be similar but more effective.

Too, the recent changes to group experience would mean that groups would be far
more advantageous than they were while I was doing this... but I think my points
are still cogent, soloing may well still be better exp for some clerics than
grouping.
