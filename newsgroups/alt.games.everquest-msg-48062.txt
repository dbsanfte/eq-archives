Hmmm.  The guild I'm joining seems to have high-40's to low-50's members.
It also says it isn't meant to be a raid guild, but a role-playing guild.
I'm joining it because it is composed of very nice people.  Some of which I
know in real life.  However, I'd also like to do raids, especially for gear
like Ethereal Mist stuff.

Is this because the game itself won't allow any character under 46's level
to go there?  I don't see much difference between a 41st level cleric and a
46th.  We don't get a new rez spell until 49th.

Anyone know what's the situation on Tunare server?

"FFA"?  Free for all?

That's good to hear.  =)
