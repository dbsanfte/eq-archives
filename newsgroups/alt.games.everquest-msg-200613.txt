What negative effects?  If you don't like KEI don't get one.  If you
don't like players with KEI, then don't group with them.  The choise
is YOURS.

I doubt this but it is easy to test.  Just go to busy zones, shout out
your doing a Poll and tabulate results.   Since I often have a
character in Nexus, I can count how many times per minute someone is
shouting they want KEI ("anyone KEIing?").  This indicates a HUGE
DEMAND not "no strong opinion either way" nonsense your spouting.

I doubt Sony will nerf KEI for the simple reason that they will lose a
vast amount of income.  Piss off players and lose revenue.  I doubt
the corporate execs at Sony will allow that and if it did happen, then
a few dozen letters to the CEO of Sony will reverse the decision
pretty quickly (CEO's care only about profit and don't want customers
complaining).
