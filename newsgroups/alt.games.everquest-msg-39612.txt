So you're saying that every level 30 mob in OT gives exactly the same amount of xp,
since they are the same level and in the same zone? I believe that's incorrect,
though I certainly couldn't prove it.
 Secondly, your advice about killing the highest level mobs you can needs a
modifier. Verant has stated in no uncertain terms that the max xp you can get from a
mob is that of one who is three levels above you.  For that reason, if you are tenth
level, you will get the same xp from a 13th level mob as you would from a 20th level
mob, were you able to take one down.
