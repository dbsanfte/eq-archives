  So far, I have seen at least a dozen outright
dismissals of this post as insane drivel or a
mere troll, at best.

  Not one seemed to realize that SOME of the
contents were, in fact, quite true.
  For example, "genius" Einstein did claim that
it was not possible to build an atomic bomb,
just as the poster stated.  He further claimed that
even if such a bomb were to be built, it would
prove impossible to deliver to its target due to
an immense weight requiring a gigantic barge
to support, etc.   The bomb was then not only
built, but carried to its target- by airplane...

  A multitude of examples were given of how
Einstein "plagiarized" the published work of
several others, but not a single word of refutation
from the critics.  None of the usual corrections
to names, dates, and so forth, which are the norm
here on rgc when someone foolishly leaves
themselves wide open like this poster did in
providing so many minute details.  Hmmm.  I can
only surmise that the Jews did a very thorough job
of brainwashing their multitudinous victims...  ;-)
