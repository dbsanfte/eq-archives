Hey, I didn't misread your post any worse than you misread his.  He
had only Shaman as a given, you started with "If you have both...",
which was, as I have pointed out far too many times, NOT a given.
Having rejected your faulty assumption, I read the Druid comment in
the context of the OP's post (Shaman only is presumed), an error to
be sure, but on the same scale as yours.  Besides all that, my
(incomplete) Druid feature list in comparison with Shaman stands
just as solidly when Cleric is added in as well, Cleric and Shaman
<don't> make Druid redundant.  I'm not sure whether I agree with
your argument that a Druid does not add enough to a 4-man group that
already has a Shaman and a Cleric as givens, but I will admit that
it would be a challenge to achieve a high sustained DPS with 3 out
of the 4 being one each of the priest classes.

Start?  I didn't start here, I started in our earlier exchange.  :-p
But ok, if you insist, I hereby retroactively amend the intent of my
post to be:  a response to "Ben Sisson"'s assertion that "a cleric and
shaman make a druid redundant".  Given the Cleric spell list I see
no need to actually amend any of the text, the Cleric provides no
coverage for the areas where a Druid's abilities cannot be matched by
the Shaman.

While I despise dr00ds as much as anybody, the mere existence of this
plague upon Norrath (and Luclin, and even to some degree in the Planes),
does not in any way affect my opinion of the Druid class itself, nor of
the many fine Druid players I have known in-game.  There are times when
the general prejudice against Druids, especially in the 50+ game, seems
to me quite absurd.  It's a strong class, underappreciated and rarely
played to near its potential in groups, at least in my experience.

Kaev
