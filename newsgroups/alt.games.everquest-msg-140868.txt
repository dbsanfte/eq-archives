these are okay... Forest Loops are a reasonable kill, if you want to hunt a
while in FM

> Neck: Lesser Talisman of Wistfulness  AC 2 cha wis int 3
Goblin Soul Caller (Wis 5, svMagic 10)... another FM drop
Black Alloy Medallion (Wis 5, Int 5, Mana Preservation II)... still fairly
cheap, despite the great Effect

> Face: Acryllia studed Mask
yuk... ruby veil, even silver

> Head: Savants Cap AC 2 int wis 3  Reagent Conservation 2
Othmir Fur Cap (AC 3, Agi 2, Dex 3, Wis 6, Cold +4, HP +7) about 4-500pp
Reagant Conservation isn't a worry for Druids (unless you're buffing a KK
raid and only have 2 fish scales) :o)

> Finger: Moonstone Ring str 3 mana 30 Extended Range 2
> Finger: Ruby Electrum Str 4 Wis 2
Keep the ER II... swap the Ruby Electrum for either Plat Jade ( AC4 +20 hp
+20 Mana) or Gold Ruby (Str 2 Wis 4)

> Wrist: Coterie Wristbands AC 6 int 1 HP 3  svf -1

Chipped Bone Bracelet (Wis 5, Affliction Efficiency II)
Serpentine Bracer (Extended Affliction II)... for if you upgrde the boots to
GE Boots or Coldain

> Arms: Ulthork Hide Arms AC 8 dex -3 wis 3
Good choice... not much wrong here

> Hands: Split Paw Hide Gloves AC 4 dex 3 wis 2
You're prolly stuck with these until you can afford to buy Coldain Gloves,
Grey Flesh Gloves, or Gauntlets of Iron Tactics

> Shoulders: Braided Ivy Cords  +4 AC +5 Wis Enhancement Haste I

Solid item... no real upgrade needed yet

> Chest: Ulthork Hide Tunic +13 AC +3 Wis -5 Cha -35 HP +35 Mana

Kept mine until I could afford the Acrylia Tunic (about 2k)... good item,
and underrated

> Back: Mamoth Hide Cloak AC 7 wis4 svc 5 Improved Damage I

> Waist: Crystalline Belt AC: 5 Agi: 3 Wis: 3 HP: 10

not much to upgrade without spending serious cash...
Reed Belt (AC6 Wis 5, HP 10, Extended Affliction II) is still pricey because
it's still rare

> Legs: Drake-hide Leggings AC 5 dex cha 5

No Gator legs?
Brown Chitin Legs (AC12, Str 5, Wis 4, HP 25, Mana 25... plate look) are
appearing in Bazaar... I snapped up a pair for 1200pp, but I think that was
lucky... usually 2-3k

> Feet: Kobold Hide Boots AC 5 agi 3 HP 10 Extended Affliction 2

Good choice

> Primary: Koada'Dal Falchion of Tunare 7/24 str wis 3

lots of 1Hblunt around the Bazaar with better stats, I'm guessing you keep
this for Epic practice :o)

> Secondary: Testament of Vanear  wis mana 10  mana preservation I

Better than my CGS I still carry at lvl 44 :o)
Rygorr Oracle Sheild (AC 12, Wis 5, mana 50) is getting cheaper (under 2k,
down from 3-4k) so you might find a bargain

Looks like you're still going for AC, and most of my suggestions lack AC...
so ignore if that's your style :o)
