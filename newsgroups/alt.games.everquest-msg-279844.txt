You're probably right.  Nevertheless, I stand by my prediction of
targeted hunting.  I *want* those Dwarven Work Boots, durnit!  Who's
coming with me?

That sounds like it summarizes the philosophy fairly well.

I want to come back to this idea.

Let me get back to you in a day or two, after I try this out.  I know I
can get to 120-ish smithing on only vendor bought stuff, maybe higher.
What makes me doubt the ease of doing this is the limited ability to
raise cash at lower levels and what those vendor-bought materials cost.
 I think the banded combines cost on the order of a plat each (or
more), and that is a lot of money at level 10.  You get much of that
back, if you resell to a vendor, but failures will be costly.  After
that, you'd definitely want to be farming lots of fine steel for ornate
chain, and you won't get that at level 20.

Apparently not.

Ow.  I understand your point.  Let me try to wrestle with this a bit,
at least as an academic exercise.  Losing out on a tradeskill economy
bothers me. :(  I can imagine a few trading scenarios that don't seem
too bad.  Poke holes in them, if you can. :)

I'm a smith.  I'm working hard to raise my smithing, and I suddenly
need lots of leather padding for fine plate.  I'm not really interested
in tailoring.  I go farm up lots of pelts and spiderling silks.  I go
to my buddy in the guild who is an accomplished tailor.  "Hey, could
you please turn these components into leather padding for me?"  There
might or might not be a fee for this service.  Perhaps I bring him a
few stacks of silk or something.

I hate doing tradeskills.  Passionately.  However, I really crave some
LDON plate armor.  I'm going to go on several LDON runs and collect the
ingredients needed for the tempers.  Then, I will go buy the
ingredients needed for a combine or three, or kill for any that require
drops.  I then look up the guild smith and ask him to press Combine for
me.  Again, perhaps there is a fee.  Perhaps I donate a few extra
materials for tempers so he can attempt more skillups.

I am said guild smith, working on LDON plate.  I know my skills are
developed beyond those of most others.  I also know that all this LDON
plate I'm making to skill up on is desired by other people.  I want to
sell my LDON plate in the bazaar.  I will use the proceeds to buy more
stuff from vendors to skill up further.

We've been on a long crawl through Lower Guk, camping upgrades for
everyone.  Over the course of the camp, the drops have magically failed
to adjust themselves to just what everyone needs.  It all gets sorted
out, but there is one more Ykesha sword lying around than the melees
can possibly use.  The magician takes it and offers to trade it to his
friend, the ranger, in return for a drop from Najena that he needs for
focus gear.

I am a master smith and a plate tank.  I can craft Bazu armor.  Can I
trade a piece to a shaman in return for him crafting me a spiffier
augment?

I am an enchanter.  I can create mana vials.  A guildie tailor, a
druid, comes up to me and asks for help getting them.  I tell him to
roll his own $%#@ chanter alt to make them or get booted from the
guild. :)

The thought of raising research skill without any vendor diving makes
me shudder..

Forget that!  I'll BUY it from him, at whatever the vendor is offering!
 Do you how much fine steel I need to skill up smithing? :)  Assume
that I'm capable of killing for it myself.  But I've been stuck at the
$@%* forge all day...

This is actually much easier for me to take. :)

I understand.  Is there any point, consistent with this philosophy, at
which you can say - you've invested the effort, but in a different,
acceptable way?  Certainly, farming hill giants to buy the Sword of
Pwning that drops from critters 15 levels higher is not kosher.
Remember that we're talking about a guild here, not a "lone ranger".
Can we do anything for each other besides fight at each others' sides?


> I thought it was to avoid the screwed up EQ economy... not recreate it.

Yes.  Are there aspects of the economy that are NOT screwed up?  Are
there player to player trades that do not cause these problems?

Tradeskills are a bit of an odd duck.  Anyone can go up to 200 skill,
and we're primarily talking about the lower skill levels (e.g. banded
armor) that, theoretically, anyone could acquire.  Is there room for
allowing specialization within the guild that would not lead to economy
problems?  On the other hand, tradeskills also allow almost an end run
around content.  The way to get the Uber Sword "should" be to kill the
Nasty Monster.  Does crafted gear take away from that?
