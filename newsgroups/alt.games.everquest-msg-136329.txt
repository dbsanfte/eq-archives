I think I'll take Margaret Murray's word over most
amateurs.

Have you read any of her books, or do you just
discount them because of their titles?

No, it doesn't.

You missed, or ignored, the part of the thread

Chosen?

Where do you get the idea that I think all history

You mean like the Scots, English, Irish, Welsh,
