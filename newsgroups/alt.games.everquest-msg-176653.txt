Yeah I noticed that the music was much more full sounding. I always like 
playing with the music, helped me know when I was in attack mode or not. 
I have a friend however, that plays with no sound on at all. I always 
liked being able to hear something walking up, but he seems to play fine 
without it. Although he does a lot of raiding, so I figure having no 
sound at all helps his framerate somewhat.
