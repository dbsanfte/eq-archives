I wish I was in CoH. I played the last 3 days of the beta and got
seriously hooked. However, until I am gainfully employed, I can't play
retail. :( I'm not going to depend on m'lady to pay for yet another
one of my toys, even though she has offered. Playing "housewife" only
gets me so far in earning my keep...
