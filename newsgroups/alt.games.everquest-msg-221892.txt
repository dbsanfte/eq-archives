Summon corpse has been in the game over 2 years. All graveyards have
done for raiding guilds is eliminate the plat sink. As any zone with a
graveyard is currently at least a 40+ zone, it's only eliminated having
to find a necro or sk who's willing to come and summon your corpse. Why
weren't people as upset when the summon corpse spell went in as they are
over graveyards?
