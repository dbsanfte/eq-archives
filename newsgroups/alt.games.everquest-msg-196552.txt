Now thats just plain absurd and goes back to knowing how to play your class,
and NOT about knowing how to play your class in a RAID situation.

Oh, and for the record Ive been on MANY Kael Arena raids where I was the
designated Snarer/Porter/Spot healer, and never ONCE have I gotten aggro
from sitting to med. Aggro from snaring to soon, or haveing to spam heals
yes, but as I said, NEVER from just plain sitting.  That been my same
experience in HoT too.
