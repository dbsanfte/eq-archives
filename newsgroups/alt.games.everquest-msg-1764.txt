Ok, I'll most likely get a flame or two for this, but I had to let y'all
know about it.  Compuexpert (http://www.compuexpert.com) is having a 48 hour
madness sale on Everquest Ruins of Kunark and Scars of Velious expansion
$24.90 for BOTH.  PLUS only $4.99 for 2 day FED EX Shipping.

I am in no way affiliated, with them, nor is this meant to be spam, but if
anyone is thinking about buying EQ, it's a damn good deal.
