On guild hunts, the rule of thumb is that the cleric is the overseer of the
party.  The line of thought is that they're usually on their butts (or in my
case, on a drog), in the back, and have a full view of the room and
potential adds.  They also keep up with the mana checks.  When the cleric
calls for an evac, the druids or wizards pull the trigger.  Should anyone
else call for an evac, wait until you hear from the cleric.

If the cleric goes down, evaccer's discretion.

Pickup groups are more dicey because they're less structured.  Having been
in the front with a ranger and SK, in the back with a druid and cleric, and
in the middle with a chanter, I'd say that from the front I'm too busy with
the mob to worry about my own health, let alone that of the party.  I'll
deal with the mobs ... someone else needs to deal with the rest of the party
(including the decision to evac).

I tend to watch health when playing a chanter, but I don't know how much of
that is "healer habit".

Have I been evacced before and disagreed with the call?  Sure I have.  But
particularly in LDoN where you don't have to fight your way back, I doubt
I'd say anything.

Sounds like the mission was going to be a failure regardless.  Better to
save the XP already gained than lose it on a lost cause.

My 2cp, fwiw.
