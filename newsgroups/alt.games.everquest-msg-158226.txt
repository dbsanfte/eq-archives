We're not talking about a user interface. We (at least me, anyhow) are
talking about a piece of code giving a new chat medium, just like the
chat channels. So it's very different. Also talking about their assenine
"no drop spells" as low as level 29, but that's another bitch.

If you're talking about going into the new planes, then not at all. I'll
pay for new zones and content. (I did, in fact. Two copies.) But again,
we're not talking about that. The bazaar/Nexus are new zones. The Iksar
went along with Cabilis as did leveling past fifty. All part of the new
zones.  Extremely different if you stop kissing Sony's ass for a moment
and think about it. That was new code that was specific to that
expansion. This is code that's ALREADY ON YOUR MACHINE! Hello? Is this
on? They had to build bullshit into the expansion to STOP YOU from using
it. That's what today's patch was about. (partially). Different as night
and day.

Nope. I just got new chat channels in the last couple of months and
didn't have to buy a god damned thing. New spells got added all the
time, and I didn't have to buy a god damned thing. In fact, if all I had
was the original release, and I worked a wizard up to level 49, a friend
could go buy those translocate spells for me that we only just recently
got and I could send people all over.

Some things are specific to a given release and/or set of zones. This is
just user side functionality and spells that anyone could have. They are
being purposly "locked" to the expansion to get it to sell, when all
they should be selling you is the new zones, content, etc.

Different as night and day, since you asked.
