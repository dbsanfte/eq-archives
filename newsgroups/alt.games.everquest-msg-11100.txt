Sometimes yes, sometimes no...it depends on just how superior the better
D/DL weapon is. You would not put a tombcarver (delay is what, 17?) over a
priceless velium warsword in the primary hand, because even if the sword is
slower, the ratio is ungodly, and you want that to get swung as much as
possible.

No, the damage bonus is a flat number, and is not a percentage of any kind.
As a rule of thumb, the faster weapon goes primary, but the exact stats of
your two weapons can flip that around.
