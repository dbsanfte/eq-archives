hmm... I did not say playing it was a complete disappointment. 

Let me rephrase so you can understand what I "ment".

I am so glad they have the others features that are being added,
becasue the info they have put out makes me feel that the New
creatures and New zones will be a complete disappointment.  I had
expected to see more zones added, and more creatures, rather than
modified models of previously used creatures.
I do hope the representation is just a tickler of what is to come but
I fear that the info they have shared is all they will be adding.

hmm... much better?

I am sorry if I was not very clear, I did just look at the page, and
well was rather disappointed on the Lack of variety in the "New"
creatures, all I saw were the new luggalds.
So I fired off my comment.

Aye, they could be very well designed and I do hope they are.  But my
False expectations were to see more zones, as in the # they added for
Velious or Kunark, rather than only the 5.

hmmm... alot of new creature... no not just bigger rats, drolvargs,
gnolls, ogres.... etc... but new creatures... Like the Shissar were,
or like the Luggalds, the aliens, the various new beasts in PoP.  

I had hoped for "more".  As with all things... expectations can be let
down...

Its sorta like getting all the Hype about a new movie, and gettting
wound up to see it, and then to actualy go and it be a flop.
It is my fault for being disappointed in the new creatures, and the
new zones.  But it is still My disappointment.

good hunting
