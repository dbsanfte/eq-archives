Filthy dwarf clerics... always on the safe side.  As a human cleric, I'm a
bit more cavalier when it comes to combat and healing.  I often let my
warriors get down in health before casting a complete heal.  The tanks love
to see multiple blows for 300 / 400 in succession and the mobs face suddenly
turn to sheer terror as the tank shreds through 1000hp in a matter of
seconds.  On the flipside, the tanks blood gets pumping because he doesn't
know the the mob is going to suddenly multi hit him and end it right there,
sort of a catch 22 but the adrenalin is rushing on all sides... I've yet to
fizzle or lose a tank in that scenario yet.  Watching full health bars is no
fun in my books :)

Kudos tanks, keep the swords swinging!
