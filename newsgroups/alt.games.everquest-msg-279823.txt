Random buffs of generosity are a small but significant part of what 
makes EQ great. I would never push to eliminate that. It's one of the 
biggest beefs I had with EQ2.

I kind of figured that as well. At some point I may check my bank acount 
and see 50kpp there. So? Who says I have to spend it just because it's 
there? I get little satisfaction from buying gear. I'd *much* prefer to 
earn it myself.

Thanks for the tips. If you could drop me an email, I'd appreciate it. I 
might need to pick your brain on occasion as far as dealing with some of 
these issues goes.
