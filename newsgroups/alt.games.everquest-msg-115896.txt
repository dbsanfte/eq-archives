First you cancel your account normally by clicking Account then End Billing
from the main screen.  You can then resubscribe as a normal user or just
wait until the end of the billing month when it will ask you if you want to
resubscribe.  Then you have to send mail to eqlegends@soe.sony.com saying
you need all of your characters moved back to their old servers.  If you
have created any characters on Stormhammer, also include in that email which
new characters you want moved to which servers.  It will probably take a day
or two before the characters are transferred because a GM has to manually do
it. You can send the email any time; it doesn't have to be just after you
cancel or before your current subscription runs out.
