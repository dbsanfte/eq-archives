A couple of months ago I got burned out a bit and let my EQ
subscription lapse. Yesterday I restarted it, and for some reason
it is now completely bogged down on my system. The frame rate or
something has slowed down so much that it's unplayable -- like
watching a movie where the projector is skipping.

What's strange is that absolutely _nothing_ changed on my system
in the interval. Same processor, video card, RAM, OS, etc. as
before I quit a couple months ago. I've had all the EQ expansions
for 6 months. My system is near the low end of the hardware
requirements for SOL, but that was true a few months ago and it
ran just fine then. I don't have any problems with the system
running anything but EQ.

I _think_ that the problem is worse on Luclin than elsewhere in
Norrath, if that means anything.

I went through the supplemental manual and changed some settings
in eqclient.ini but it didn't help. I may not have changed the
right ones, of course.

So, two questions:

-- did something happen in the EQ patches the last couple of
months that raised the hardware bar for systems to run it
decently?

-- what tweaks (in eqclient.ini or elsewhere) can I try to
improve performance?
