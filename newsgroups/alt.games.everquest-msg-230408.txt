 It's rather well

I use OE, always have, does what I want it to do (maybe Im missing out on
some features, but the posts are still here to read which is what is
important to me).

As for my knowledge, well, I could know everything about newsreaders that
there is to know, and still not know anything about the subject of the
newsgroups :)

Only gripe (and its a small one), is that it automatically starts your post
at the top, which is annoying, but sometimes handy (before replying I
generally re-read the post I am replying to, before adding what I wanna say
at the bottom).

Crap analogy time :)

Judging someone's knowledge (or percieved knowledge) from what newsreader
they use is like judging how well someone will perform at their job, based
on what type of car they drive to get there :)

I may have a crap choice in cars, but that fact alone doesnt make me
ignorant :)

(as noted in another thread, currentley bored at SF, hence the
semi-pointless rant :) ).
