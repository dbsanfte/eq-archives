Certainly. I wasn't implying that they could tank the same mobs that a
shaman can. Although I can think of at least one mob that hits in the
70s and doesn't finish turning light blue till 55, so a druid could
probably porcupine up through lvl 55 with enough dedications.

I think you'd be surprised there. The druids I know have every bit as
many hitpoints as I do, although they do fall behind a bit in the AC
department. Probably because they did HoT while I can't stand the
place and make do with my Thurgadin armor. A serious raiding druid
would blow me away but I don't think that my gear is all that bad for
someone that doesn't like to raid.
