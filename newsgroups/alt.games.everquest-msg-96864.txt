Twinking is the Everquest equivalent of a rich father giving
his son a Ferrari to drive to high school.

And it gets the same wide ranges of reactions:

   "Cool!"
   "Anyone who has that kind of cash to throw around
     has to have cheated to get it"
   "I wish I had one.  Maybe someday..."
   "He thinks he's so cool with that car, but it's
     not like he earned it himself"
   "How am I going to get a girlfriend when I have to
     compete with *that*?  It's not fair"
   "There should be laws to prevent that sort of
     obscene squandering of wealth when there are
     starving children in <wherever>"
   "Hey, give *me* one next"
   "The fat bourgeois will be humbled come the revolution"
