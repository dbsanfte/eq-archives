Its not 20% health, per se.

Whats happened is you died.  That is to say, your HP went to below zero.

The reason you weren't dead when you zoned is that you had HP buffs and HP gear
on, boosting your apparant HP up to 20% over dead.

So the game peeks at your apparant HP, strips off all your buffs, and lets you
zone after all, instead of killing you off "in between".  Often instead of just
over the zone line, you'll also find yourself appearing at the succor spot for
the zone you zoned into.

Since the game clearly has access to your apparant HP, the explaination for why
this happens seems farfetched to me (to prevent you dying while zoning).  Far
more likely, its to cut down on the ability of superbuffed and twinked people
using the zone lines as a hunting tool.  Zoning is a lot like an FD that Always
works, for every class.  If it strips off your buffs, though, then it becomes a
big time sink.
