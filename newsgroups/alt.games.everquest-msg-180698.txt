Hi everyone:

After messing around with a Mage pet after playing a Wizard I have a
question. I'd like to create a macro that will /assist my pet - can I do
this without having to update the macro each time he dies, and if so how? I
seem to recall a very long time ago playing a Necro and having an assist
key, but for the life of me I can't remember how I did it.

I've tried ..

/target pet
/assist

This doesn't work ..

Yes, I know I can press F1 and then /assist, but I'd like to at least know
if what I want to do is .. doable.

Also, do I have to out-damage my pet in order to claim all the experience a
mob will give - I know this used to be the case, but I seem to recall that
being changed.

Finally - any good Mage Website you can recommend would be fabulous -
Graffe's is a great source of information for Wizard's - Is there a Mage
equivalent? ..

Thank you for your time as always ..

Stevie.
