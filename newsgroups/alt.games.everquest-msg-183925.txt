Thats not exactly correct. Try to petition and use the Contact your GM 
feature, they can easily check if you had the items in a no rent bag 
when servers crashed, and they were gone when servers got up again.
I recently got for 14K items in sale value back from the exact same 
problem, except that one was my OWN fault for forgetting i had the 3 
items in a No Rent Bag when i logged out. Took 4 days, but got them back
