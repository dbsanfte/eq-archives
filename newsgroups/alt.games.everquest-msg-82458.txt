Er, try "binding there is IDIOTIC" or "people who bind there are IDIOTS" 
and you may be onto something. As far as I'm concerned, "bind point > no 
bind point" for every possible set of coordinates of that bind point.

I mean, didn't that poor warrior bother to check out the zone and /con a 
few mobs before she got a bind, or think that when she popped her gear 
would still be on her corpse? Sorry, but I feel that my usually 
bottomless well of sympathy has suddenly dried out.
