Because they never deemed it worth bothering with for us to 
be able to open more than two. It illustrates what happens very well
when a company makes a game that they don't really play much. Yeah
verant always plods out the fact that many of the people who work
there play but I don't think many of the core designers of the game do
and I think if they did a lot would be different. For example, it took
FOREVER for them to put in buying and selling 20 items. If I was one
of the makers of the game and playing it and enjoying it in the beta
and such as I was guess how long it would have taken  me to implement
buying and selling in up to 20 stacks? About 14 minutes, in fact it
would have been one of the first things I had in the game.

Similarly even playing in the beta one of the second things I would
have done would have been alowing more backpacks to be open.
