This is one of the biggest issues in the game.  Its been gone over time
and again, and there are no clear cut answers.

One thing to keep in mind, different guilds have different rules.  So one
solution is to find a guild using a system that accomodates your style of
play, and join that guild.

As far as open raids go, one solution is to find out what the rules will
be in advance, then only go on raids that accomodate you.

Another solution (the one I use) is to ignore loot issues as much as you
can, and go with raids, guilds, whatever, strictly based on how much fun
they are.

But I will say this; I much prefer random to any form of either points or
dictate systems.  I go on raids for the fun of them, not because I'm
getting points or because there's loot there for me.  Fortunately, I go on
enough raids that I do end up with items in a points system, so its not an
actual detriment to me to see this sort of system used.   Dictate...well
its actually the best system of all, with a tight pool of close friends
who trust each other, and a loot officer who is really on top of things.
Its horrible work for that officer, though, and has the potential to
really split a guild up.

The nice thing about random, to me, is that there's no work at all
involved, no descision making process, its fast, its painless, and there's
noone to "blame" for the results; politics don't affect the RNG.

You mention "NBG of course" but frankly, unless you know each other so
well that a "dictate" system would work, NBG favors those who are prepared
to lie about what they "need" at the expense of those who are honest about
their needs.

The problem with random systems of any sort is that they Also favor the
dishonest; its a simple matter to look at the loot that will potentially
drop on a given raid, and decide not to go if there's nothing there that
would upgrade your character  (not a problem in a fully random environment
where items dont' have a "no drop" tag, but at the high end, little of
what you might loot will be sellable, and NBG random environments mean
that if there aren't items you can lie about and claim as upgrades, you
haven't the chance even of sellable loot).  This is the reason that most
high end guilds are run on either points or dictate... to theoretically
encourage people who might be reluctant to go places where nothing drops
for them, by rewarding them with better chances at drops later, when you
go to a place with "their" loot.

In Open raids, of course, this delayed gratification plan fails utterly;
you either use some form of random distribution, or you are robbing half
the raid of their time, pure and simple.  This is slightly less true if
you can run in "raid" mode (all particpants have POP) so that at least
some experience is generated, but generally raid experience isn't
particularly good even at its best.   What you can gain from open raids,
other than loot ( a crap shoot at best) is the experience of having done a
mob or zone you havent' before, and contacts with all those other folks
who came along... and who clearly are disposed to doing this sort of
thing, so perhaps you can call on them to join you in some raid you have
in mind in the future.  Oh, and faction... open raids in places like Kael
Drakkar work well, because while few will see loot, everyone will be in on
the faction feast, and the more the merrier.
