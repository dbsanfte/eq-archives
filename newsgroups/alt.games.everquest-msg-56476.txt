Took my Paladin (L40) to the EK event.  Got the shawl (doubt I'll use
it), the shield (gonna use it), and the mask (gonna use it).  Wanted
the cloak (I *really* want a back Wis item), but luck was against me
on it.  Oh, well.  Got almost 100 Plat in Scythes / Bronze Scythes
that people left to rot.

Took my Paladin to the Rathe event.  Got a cold blast for 500, a Harm
Touch for 351, a cold blast for 500, and got to zone just barely ahead
of my own death.  THANK YOU to the Druid who cast SoW on me in N
Karana after binding me there.

Took my Paladin to the Everfrost event.  Got several items to drop,
but all Druid or Ranger.  Called 'em out for others to come get.

Took my Druid (L22) to the EK event.  Got diddly squat; *way* too many
druids after the items that were dropping.

Took my Druid to Everfrost.  Got the Headdress, but nothing else.
Boo-hoo.  Got Level 23, though, hunting skeletons and werewolves.

Took my Necro (L10) to the EK event.  Got a nice ring.  Got killed and
a free trip back to Nek Forest.  Off we go.  Found a corpse in W
Commons (event was running).  Got another nice ring.  Continued on.
Into EK and down the ramp.  Guess what?  Graveyard Phantoms haunt the
gorge.  Oops.  Quick trip back to Nek Forest.  Off we go.  Back into
EK, drag corpse to somewhere safe, loot.  Head for first corpse.  Drag
to bridge, loot.  Out to scavenge.  Got a couple of scythes, then
found a spider with a nice book on it.  Got the book.  Also got a
Graveyard Wraith.  Nek Forest looks nice today.  Off we go.  Back into
EK, drag corpse to bridge, loot, log.  Now that the events are over,
it'll be log in, Gate back to Nek Forest, and go make life miserable
for some dune tarantulas.  Got 3 nice items, lost 3 blue bubbles.
Well worth it.
