Depends what your goals are, but if you just want to have fun and not
be gimped, there are many combinations that will work.

Any tank + any healer + bard
Any tank + any healer + any INT caster
Any tank + any healer + rouge
Any tank + 2 healers (not 2 of the same)
Any 3 casters (including bards and healers)
