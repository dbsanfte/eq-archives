Another solution is to use a real domain that was specifically set up
for people to use.  E.g., mouse-potato.com.  The MX record for
mouse-potato.com points to 127.0.0.1.

(So do the address records...so you can tell someone "Hey!
mouse-potato.com is mirroring your web site without permission", or,
even better "Hey! mouse-potato.com hacked your computer and stole your
files, and set up an FTP site with your name and password!  Try it...ftp
to mouse-potato.com and login with your name and password, and you'll
see all your stolen files!"  Might catch a couple of people this way
:-)).
