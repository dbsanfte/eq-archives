We had a GM on The Nameless a couple years ago who liked to ignore the rules
and get involved in the game.  He had a whole interesting story line going
involving some kind of dispute between the League of Antonica Bards and the
evil races, complete with occasional invasions of Nektulos and stuff like
that, with him and all the guides participating.

The players thought it was great, but Verant found out and fired him.
