The sequence is correct, though i you really want to conserver mana (but
kill slower) you can leave out the nuke.  And running in circles is
depriving you of precious meditation time.  When I kite with my druid I
lay down my snare, dot, then nuke.  I then run in a straight line away
from the mob and when I am a good distance away, I sit and med, when the
mob gets closer, I do the same thing, (usally run back to where the mob
came from).  If snare/dot ends, just reapply.  You should notice a big
difference in the amount of mana you have left at the end.
