Selo's consonant chain is a snare and does not "slow" the attack of the Mob.
It may appear to, but it does not.  Largo's Melodic Binding does slow the
attacks of the mob and I think you will find you get hit a lot less with
that song up instead of consonant chain.  I usually have chain memmed and
play it after the mob starts to run but it does not slow the attack.  :)  At
your level if you are soloing I suggest jonathans, largo's, and denons.
Spend a night with your bard in some isolated place with a brass equipped
and get your skill up so that you don't fail often when playing and you
won't get resisted much....just leave the computer on over night.  You might
want to check out eq.castersrealm.com for specifics on song effects.  Click
