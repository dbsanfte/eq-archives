Take the boat (come on, it's just a boat trip, it't not the
Queynos-Freeport run :), sell the belts, put all your kit in the bank,
and then jump off the highest platform in Kelethin, screaming as you
plummet to your death.

Bang, back in Freeport. At your level, you'll make the XP back in less
time than the return trip would take.
