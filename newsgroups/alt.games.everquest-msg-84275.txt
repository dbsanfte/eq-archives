Even better. Spent the night in Skyfire hunting for xp and farming spell
drops for the guild. Got some lava rock drops. But on top of that, Tiru
always /auctions for them where ever they drop. First auction, a wizard
responds and has a *STACK* of the bastards in the bank, willing to sell.
It was more than worth the trip. We also bagged five post fifty spells
for the guild in a couple hours.
