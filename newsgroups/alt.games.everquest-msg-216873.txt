So, a well assembled, competent group with less "uber" gear could, I'd
wager, finish it just as well. Not having uber gear doesn't mean
you're not going to stand a good chance of succeeding. It helps, yeah,
but it's far from necessary.

Of course, that's assuming you don't carry it to an extreme and try a
raid with everyone wearing cloth and wielding rusty daggers. ><
