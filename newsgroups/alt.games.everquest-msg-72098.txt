Well, not when porting so much as when communicating between to
systems that don't natively understand one another.

It's not really a programming language per se, but rather a highly
extensible way to describe data.

Well, an INI file is just a text file. Likewise, an XML file is just a
text file. For storing local program settings on a local machine, you
really don't need the kind of functionality provided by XML, and
frankly a basic INI file is clearer for the average user to look at
and understand.


Now, if they're going to do something about making a *hugely* more
configurable interface, the XML might start to make more sense.

We'll see.
