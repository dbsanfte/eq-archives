Naw, it's not too late to bring up the two hand skills.  I let mine lag
a bit too but managed to get them up at level 48. If you can't get a
group of understanding friends or guildies, go to a place where you can
get exp off the mobs and there's a group hunting.  Ask them very nicely
if you can practice on their pulls and offer them any buffs you can give
that they might lack. :)
