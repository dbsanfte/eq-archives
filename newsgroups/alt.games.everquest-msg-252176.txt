Titus Interactive is the parnet company of Interplay, but Interplay has
a distribution agreement with Vivendi.

    Microsoft used a similar strategy in the game market as they did
when it came to OSes - buying up other people's products and marketing
the hell out of them. Well, OK, the strategy is a little different 
now - now they pretty much buy up the competition's entire company or
create "exclusive" agreements which result in a similar situation.

     Isn't that exactly what Microsoft does, though? Well, except 
for the "turkey" part. Mechwarrior, HALO, etc, etc... all of these
were games that were either established lines or already partially
created prior to being taken over by MS. Microsoft's greatest 
contribution to gaming has been... well... eh... funneling massive
amounts of cash into gaming companies and demanding a product most
of the time.
