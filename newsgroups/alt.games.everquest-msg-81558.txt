Certainly not clerics on my server.

At dungeon level (Sebilis) the cleric a) Master loots,  b) Keeps gem drops
to repay dot costs,  c) gets to keep all the common spells that drop which
nobody needs   - the gems more often then not FAR EXCEED your cost in
peridots, and each spell can sell for nearly 15pp.

One of the greediest classes I see, is clerics!  When the cleric loots 4k in
gems, and keeps EVERY single one, they have just made off with mass profit
(granted not all clerics keep them, but the majority do).

What pisses me off too, when a chanter is using Rune V (which uses a peridot
too) and the cleric still decided to keep all gems to replace his dot costs,
whilst neglecting any other party members expenses.

I only group with friends nowadays though, so I don't have to deal with
greedy ass people anymore :)
