Probably true for most people. I usually see the discs at software discount
stores (Action or Software & Stuff if you live near Sunnyvale, CA) - I
didn't even think 98SE was available anymore from mainstream shops - only ME
like you said. I would also avoid ME if possible.

If you are going to spend anywhere near $90 for an OS upgrade, I'd go with
Win2k or XP - or you may find yourself in the OS upgrade market sooner than
you like. Again ...
