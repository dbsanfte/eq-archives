I think that some Gm's have gotten to a "no tolerance" level with certain
things. Whether the name is guardian or something stupid like saladtosser,
they tend to think that once you offend, you're always an offender and maybe
getting snotty about it is their way of making you behave yourself next
time. I suppose Verant and it's GM's, think that everyone reads every bit of
documentation provided with the game and supplemental documentation that's
provided online. But then again....ignorance of the law is no excuse
...*shrug*

And good god Carin, don't assume anyone on Eq is a female because of thier
name. Before i started playing Eq, I was searching on the internet for info
about the game to see if it was at least worth bothering with the first 30
days. A company that reviews games, suggested that although 52% of the
characters on servers are female, only around 16% of all players are
actually female players....makes ya wonder who your Eq wife is huh.

Here's a list of all their "policies"...something to read when they are
patching the servers yet again.
