I made the most of it to do some of my epic turn ins.  I was putting these
parts off until I had the undivided attention of a druid for a couple of
hours...

I Dinged 54 in KC.  Went to FV got a TL to TD.  Swam to Alrik Farsight,
talked to him, swam to Firepots, got a port to Felwithe, did the shopping
subquest there, ran to BB (via Kaladim where I turned in my Jade Reaver for
the enchanted clay) got a TL back to TD, swam to Alrik again turned in the
receipt, got the ancient pattern.  Swam back to Translocator Deela got a TL
back to FV.

In under 60 minutes of game time, I completed two parts of the epic that
would have taken a good deal longer if I had been dependant on druids, boats
or a combo of the two.  I would recommend any rangers working on their epics
to make use of them while they are there.

Tzen, 54 Ranger, The Seventh Hammer.

P.S.  There is new stuff in the firepot room I never saw before.  A large
fire in the centre of the room, and a skelly called "Cursed Traveller".  I
sneaked and Hailed him and here's what I got in response:

The eyes of the skeleton are bleak and dreary as though the essence which
keeps it standing is not really there, a surreal look into the future for
those who make their stay in the immediate room around you. The ominous
figure does not make any sound but nods in your direction as if to tell you
that he died here long ago by resting by the nearby fire for too long. In
your mind you hear the eerie thoughts of this undead figure, alluding to the
fact that it is unwise for you to remain here for too long, lest the mighty
water dragon overtake you, as it overtook him.

Anyone have any idea what he's for?  I didn't take the time to find out
myself, but perhaps someone else has.....
