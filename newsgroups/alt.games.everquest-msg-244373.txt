Healers right outside the room, on both sides, or just one side, if you 
are sure you can position him, and keep him there.  His AoEs will not 
penetrate doors or walls.  Mostly though, burn that bastard to the ground 
so fast that it doesn't matter.  Make sure all your healers have extended 
range 4 items.
