He's not asking about how to talk to someone in a channel
(via EQIM or not).

He's asking about how to talk to them if they're logged into
EQIM, but in no particular channel.

The answer is that you talk to them as you normally would,
with "/tell so-and-so Hi there".

If they have already sent you a message, you can reply to
them with "r" as usual.
