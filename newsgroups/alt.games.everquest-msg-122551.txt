    Ours, too. The patch that shuffled focus effects just killed me. Before
it, I was landing nukes for 1110 damage (ID III on my Bone-Clasped Girdle),
critting DL for 2000 and Remedy for 1000 (IH III on my Ring of the Shissar),
and all my buffs were lasting longer (EE III on my Shadel Bandit Ring). Now,
the only good effect I have is my buffs cast fast, which is pleasant - cuts
nearly eight seconds off a Blessing of Aegolism cast. But it's nothing like
those other effects.
