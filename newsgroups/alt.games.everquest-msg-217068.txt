That was some straw man brought up by Bergh.  He based it on the fact that I
said I would pull at 30% mana (which of course I would, but I'd also pull at
100% mana and not purposefully try to drain the cleric for kicks).

And that's why I ignore any arguments of that sort.  Simple experience shows
that people act differently based on, among other things, how much mana they
have left.

I do need to take a break after an adventure or three just for that reason. 
My brain needs a rest, my fingers need a rest, etc.  :)
