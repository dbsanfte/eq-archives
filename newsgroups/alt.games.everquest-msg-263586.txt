I couldn't tell if you were buying runes for 60k for use within the guild, or
buying them to resell for 65k or whatever.  The danger, of course, for a price
fixer who doesn't have a monopoly is you'll be stuck with dozens of runes you
overpaid for when the flood really starts...

Is your limit still 60k?

How's this going (the price fixing/speculation, if you are doing so)?  I've
been watching prices (on Quellious), and some are down to 45k at times,
and then bounce back to 60k, I presume due to speculators buying the 10 or so
cheap ones for sale at any given time.

Loral repeated this prediction in a more recent mobhunter posting too.  I
suspect they'll level off at 10k in 6 months or so, but I don't have that much
hope for November.  I know a lot of folks who'll pick up a few at 50k, more at
40k, more at 30k, etc.  I think there's a LOT of pent-up demand, and prices
will drop pretty linearly until bottoming out.
