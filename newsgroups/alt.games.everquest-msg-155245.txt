You don't see what race you are or how much cash you have so hopefully
these'll do, they're what I used on my necro and, well, she's doing
okay so far :)

Advisor Robe
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2087
Super-cheap in the bazaar now (got mine for 70pp quite awhile ago),
good int and mana.  My necro still uses one, although she's saving up
for Tolapumj's Robe (3k on EMarr :()

Bracelet of Woven Grass
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=776
Not to be confused with the Woven Grass Bracelet which is druid only
;p - has spell haste 1 as a focus effect (spells 20 or lower with a 3
second+ cast time cast faster - one of the nicer focus effects out
there) and I saw one going on EMarr Bazaar for 10pp earlier today -
seeing as you have 5 more levels to use this with, I think it'll still
be a good investment.  I need to upgrade mine because I'm level 29 now
but dang, focus effects get expensive after I :(

Moonstone Ring
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1668
a bit of int and HP, plus the extended range II means this'll work on
spells up to level 44 - extended range meaning you can cast spells on
stuff farther away.  Also a very, VERY nice focus effect when you've
got something large and mad coming at you that you wish to run the
other way, especially since many of the necro spells (well, imho) are
long-casting.  Personally I will probably switch to a golden bracer (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=842 ) if I can get a
good deal on one, because I got a good deal on a range slot item with
lots of HP and I'd rather have the extra int in there.  I got my
moonstone ring for about 30pp.  Probably cheaper now.

While we're on the topic of focus effects btw, go here:
http://www.geocities.com/zinphandelchianti/focus.html it's a page
written by a poster here that has a wonderful amount of info on focus
effects, what they do for who, and what items have them.  I forgive
you, Ziphandel, for linking to a contest Canadians cannot enter.
Maybe.

That's all the stuff I can think of for now :/  Of course that's
because I'm not logged on, so I can't look at what my necro's wearing
:)  A good idea is to go to the bazaar (there's a bank there so don't
worry about getting cash up there) and do a search for items with hp,
items with mana, and items with int (I believe int starts to become
more effective than pure mana after level 20, can someone confirm
this?, if so int over mana for sure), and check prices.

Oh, one more thing: I picked up a gemmed dagger (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7648 ) for 25pp in
the bazaar.  Used it for quite a few levels until I got a book that
gave me more int to put into my primary slot.

Ryou
(feels the need to point out that she's no expert in equipping a
caster, but has been pretty happy with what she has picked up along
the way)
