Yesterday Bebinn was camping the crazed gobbies in Butcherblock.  Yeah, 
I know, way too easy for a 36 druid but I'm sick of the dang cougars 
killing me in IC. In newb zones and generally not wanting to get roped 
into doing ports I was /roleplay.
Anyway, went in Kaladim to visit the bank and as I was getting ready to 
zone out some guy hailed me.  Since I'm polite, I stopped and said 
hello.   He says to me, "Are you a dr00d?"  For half a second, I 
considered saying yes.  Then I decided, NO, I am most definately not a 
Dr00d.  I am a Druid of Tunare! So I said, "Nope." and zoned out. 
Didn't even give him a chance to rant at me about it.
