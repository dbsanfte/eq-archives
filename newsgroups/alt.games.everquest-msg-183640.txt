With this patch we introduced the ability for intelligence casters
(Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards) to create additional spell
scrolls using their research skill. Many of the newly researchable spells
have only been available from quests or killing NPCs in the past. The new
research still requires components from risky locations or dangerous foes.
Our goal is to increase the number of ways to earn rare spells, without
reducing the challenge required.

This, however, creates a bit of an inequity between the intelligence casters
and the priest classes (Clerics, Druids and Shaman) when it comes to
acquiring this type of spell. While there is nothing inherently wrong with
different classes earning their spells in different ways, we don't see a
reason to give more options to one type of caster than another. In this
case, we have taken the opportunity to give the research skill a little more
value and at the same time negate any imbalance between classes.

Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation
of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their
research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and priest classes will
benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining these spells. This helps
out both priests and intelligence casters, and creates a new niche for
research as a trade skill.
