Agreed, this change makes sense.  Go camp somewhere "safe", log into an
alt, play for an hour or two, go have lunch, run errands, whatever,
then log back over and viola.  More time than it would take to just sit
and med, but allows for better use of that time.

This change, however:
--BEGIN-QUOTE--
At character select, you will see a new button "Go Home" Which will
move your character to its home city if it has not logged in for the
previous 6 hours.
--END-QUOTE--

I can see this getting abused all to scrap.  Get yourself in some hot
water or well into some seriously dangerous zone you can't seem to
manage to get back out of?  No problem, just log out, go have dinner,
watch a movie, run some errands, go to work, get some sleep, whatever,
log back in, and viola!  I guess it's no worse than the old MUD /home,
but I didn't like that either :)

Xiphos - At least with some of the old MUDs, using /home meant leaving
all yourcurrent posessions at the previous location.
