You don't need to turn it off.  You can simply move it out of your
Everquest directory.  Compress the logs into a zip file named
EQ_month_year.zip and you can go back to them easily should you ever
want to parse them.  It's a lot easier for EQ to write the log to a
fresh file than to a huge text file and text files compress well.
