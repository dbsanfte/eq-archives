No, actually, I don't. Even if I did the comparison isn't valid - it
doesn't requires 365 days of play to level up, nor would I stand up in
a crowded room of strangers and yell "Happy birthday to me".

I fail to see anything that quite qualifies for a celebration in going
from level 3 to 4. Or 44 to 45. 50, there's a possible cause for
celebration.
