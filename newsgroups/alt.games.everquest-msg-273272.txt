  Egad. Now my kitty bard will never meet you. Ah well, he has his uses.
I'll get him out of Paludal Caverns someday, and find out how to really play
the class.

  I've been meaning to check out Quellious for some time; after reading your
post, I went ahead and did so. Made a frog wizard named Phrogment. (Now
that I know how fast wizards can pile up money, I prefer them for starting 
out
on a new server.) Did the usual nuke/melee for 3 levels, barely outran the 
kobolds
on my way to the PoK book, then healed up, grabbed a temp, and hit the
Freeport courtyard. Level 1 PBAE nuke kicked ass; I cleared half the 
courtyard
at once. Ding level 4, with others apparently not far behind. Hope to see 
you guys,
though TP is still my main home.

  (Hmmm...wonder if we can get a movement going among maybe half the servers
to get everyone to migrate to the other half? That would restore population 
densities
and make the game look like it was still alive...)
