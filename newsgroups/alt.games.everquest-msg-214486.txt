I didn't bother logging in more than my bazaar bot yesterday, but I did
see that her rod of oblations from HS had a slot, so I don't think it's
limited to Antonica/Faydwer/Odus.  My guess is that they gave them to
everything, then removed slots on a case-by-case basis.

Incidentally, since type 4 is a proc, do weapons that already have procs
have this slot as well? I haven't had a chance to check my GSot4W yet.  

Two procs...mmmm......
