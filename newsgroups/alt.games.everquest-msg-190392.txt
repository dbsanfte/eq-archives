If you don't know the NPC in question, he's the one you turn in the
pirate troll heads to in Neriak for a very nice mid-level ring. Is
this guy ever up? Right after LoY came out, I got the ring for a
guildie (yeah, it's no drop, but this is FV) and then about a week ago
I got some for myself, but when I went to turn them in, no
commisioner. I've been back there every night for a week and a half,
and I never see him. I've /petitioned it several times, to no avail.
Do any of the other servers have this problem?
