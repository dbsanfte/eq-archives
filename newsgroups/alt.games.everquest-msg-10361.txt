Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that
is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that
group's specific permission.

This is from

So yes, according to Verant, you KSed them. Once you took a poke at
the mob and it kept on towards the others, you should have backed off.
There are people, including some guides,  who will tell you that if
the other group isn't swinging at the mob it's OK, but that's not what
the PNP says. 

OTOH, who cares. :P It's really not something to get too exercised
about one way or the other.
