Well what can i say wait until you can rock with your 49 he is so awsome,
things goes down so fast that you rarely use dots only drakness and fear and
one big tip hunt echo caverns from 40 and up to 52 its great xp and from 49
you can take the taskmaster camp with 2 spells and pet , drkness and fera
undead only one you needs may be a fast dot on the taskmaster to spped up
the kill a bit.
