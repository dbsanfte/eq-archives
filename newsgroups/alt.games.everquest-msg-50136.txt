Ok ... I wanted to have some silly fun, made a halfling rogue and ran
him over to The Hole. Sneaked and Hid (with the sucessful messages),
Ran into The Hole, and it was fun.

Now, every guide says they use such a lowlevel for CR in there. But:
I sometimes get attacked by things, sometimes not. An elemental crusader
flies at me, dead. Nex try, A crusader flies at and through me, no attack.
Die later to some Elemental Wizard in the city part of The Hole.
Question: Is it a level thing? Higher leve crusaders see me? Is it
a random thing, mobs always having a chance to see me? I'd like
to get to the end of the hole for a sightseeing tour at lvl 1, but
I end up being butchered somewhere in the city by some aggro through walls.
