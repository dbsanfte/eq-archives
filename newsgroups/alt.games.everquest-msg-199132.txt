Depends on how much money you have to spend. Someone already mentioned
the Centi Warhammer, which is nice and cheap but kinda slow if your
1hb skill isn't maxed. If you don't mind one w/o a wisdom bonus, a
Smoldering Brand (9/22 with a 14pt proc) has always been my newbie 1hb
of choice, nice ratio, fast speed and procs at first lvl. 

If you're in Unrest, you're at a level where meleeing is still a
pretty efficient way for a druid to hunt. Don't expect your weapon
damage to be a very big part of that though. Meleeing druids do their
damage by porcupining (their damage shields). You let the mobs kill
themselves by hitting you, healing yourself in between if need be.
Probably takes an eye towards a bit different gear choices, don't
ignore hitpoints and ac if you want to go that route. 

Rgds, Frank
