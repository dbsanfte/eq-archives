Where is a good place for a 45 shaman to go in Velious?  I am looking to do
some quests to upgrade my armor (only 197 wisdom so far) so I am looking
torwards wolfcaller armor and things like that.  I have a wizard that will
take me just about anywhere I want/need to go, so far I have not explored
Velious very much (GD, EW, CC, Thurg)
