And the other big lesson, which Everfrost taught me well, is to con
very carefully. Decayed skeletons are easy, and rewarding, kills for
a low level, whereas a soloist will leave a trail of corpses behind
it. It only happens a couple of times before you stop making assumptions
based on appearance.

Not to mention the number of times I almost pulled a polar bear
before noticing it was Iceberg. Never did it but that would have
been awesomely quick.
