Since you appear to be out of school for the summer, and miss the
"small bus" that took you there each day, let me educate you.

EQ running all luclin models, full clipping, and full spell effects
will drag almost ANY system to its knees in certain Luclin zones and
RAIDs with several groups fighting. Even the top of the line systems
with 2Ghz Processors, DDR memory and the latest GF4 cards with 128mb
of DDR memory.

So "jackass", the correct answer is that NO system will run EQ
perfectly in all zones with all settings maxed. 
 
The original poster asked a very valid and important question when he
posted the specs of the system he is thinking of buying for EQ. You
should take notes, and maybe mommy and daddy will buy you one just as
nice some day.
