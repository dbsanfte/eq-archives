One time I tried to find the back "bats" room in
Sol B from the Sol B entrance with my then-53 Paladin,
so as to solo the bats.  My plan was to run
back there fast, then take the rear zone-out into
Sol A to lose my train (I had made sure that no
one was in the way), then zone back in and set up
shop.

Unfortunately, thanks to the twisty passages in
Sol B and my unfamiliarity with that part of it,
I got lost.  I ended up with 3-4 Lava Duct Crawlers
on me, and countless Fire Beetles, etc.  I blew
my Lay Hands in the hopes of buying enough time
to find the Sol A zoneout, but no luck, I just
kept running into more mobs.

Paladins can't Gate to bind point, but they can
carry specialized gate potions, and I have long
such equipped myself for just such emergencies.
With less than a bubble of health left, I fired
my Lizard Blood Potion, which provides an
*instant* (uninterruptable) gate to the wizard
pyramid in the Cazic Thule maze.  (This was before
CT was changed into a high-level zone.)

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

I arrived in CT, chortling at having escaped
over a dozen killer mobs in Sol B.  Safe at
last.

Oh, wait -- three green-to-me lizards took
exception to my presence, and started to pound
on me.  They don't hit that hard, but at my
present state of health they could have finished
me off.

No problem, I'll run to the Feerrott zone-out
and lose them, I know the way well.  Run run
run through the maze, through the courtyard,
gaining more lizards, until I zone-out safely
into the Feerrott.

Phew.  Now I can finally relax for a minute.
<check maps to see where I want to go next>

I looked back up to see my health at a *tiny*
sliver.  WTF?  The lizards didn't beat me up
*that* badly...  Oh well, time to start helm-healing.
It's slow (120HP in 10 seconds), but it
conserves mana.  *Fire*.  Wait, wait, wait.

*Just* before the Deepwater Helm finishes
casting and gives me a blast of HP, I fall
over unconscious.  *WTF??*

Oh, look -- a Boiling Blood DoT buff from
the LDC's two zones ago...  I'm screwed...

"Your blood cools".  Woo hoo, I'm not screwed!
What timing!  Now I just need to wait to
recover from the unconsciousness.  Phew.

<drum fingers on desk waiting for recovery>

Five seconds later, "You have died...
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
You have entered Katta Castellum"

AARRGGHH!!
