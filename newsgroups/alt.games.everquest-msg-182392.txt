I notice most of the zones you're talking about are newbie zones.  Any 
drastic changes to those would probably mean a pretty big headache for 
any newbies unlucky enough to be caught in the middle.  Especially with 
any zone faction changes coming along with them.

They did some of this with Velious (think ring/shawl wars) and a bit more 
with Luclin (Hollowshade wars, hopper/tribal cave in DSP, etc).  I think 
the people most interested in the Luclin encounters are the tradeskillers 
who need a drop from whatever type of mob isn't up at the time :P

I think that some of the zones that might benefit more from this type of 
thing are ones with few spawns and lots of downtime between them, such as 
the Highkeep basement.

I want to see Fippy take over Qeynos ;)
