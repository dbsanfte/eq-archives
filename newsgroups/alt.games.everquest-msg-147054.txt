[ Jazz, there's nothing here for you... just move along :-p ]

Actually, I find it has made caster mobs a lot easier to solo.

One example:  I pull the gnoll casters in JP by chain casting
Stun from my Deepwater Bracer.  Since the change I have not yet
had one resist (on around 50+ casts), and so I've been hit by
only a couple of their spells when pulling (i.e. most pulls I
don't get hit).  It's kind of a slow pulling technique, but when
I can't get a group I'm more than happy to take an extra 20 to 30
seconds pulling to avoid the 400 to 1000 damage I'd take otherwise.
And in combat I can prevent most of their casts by interrupting
with my quick cast stuns (zero resists there too).  I don't take
very much damage killing these casters solo now, and in a duo or
trio they're nearly free xp.  The Gnoll Warriors, on the other hand,
give me a very hard time.  I kill them, but it hurts a lot.

Another example:  Ghoul Wizards in LGuk are easier now too, though
I'm pretty sure they're self-buffing their MR as my Stun+DD spells
remain useless and my zero damage Stuns are resisted some (this has
been true since the caster AI patch, which is why I assume its
because the ghouls are buffing themselves).

So, at least for a Paladin stuck soloing, the resist change has been
a boon overall.  And as a bonus, my DW Bracer, which I used to like
solely for its decent AC, turns out to have a use after all.
