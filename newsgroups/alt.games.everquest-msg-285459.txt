Heh heh nice subject huh?

Just sent an email to EQCS asking them if they bothered to read the
new petition feedback thread they started. Then asked them flat out if
they are trying to kill EQ by drivign people away from it with all the
bugs and unpopular changes. Then mentioned the WoW tv commercial and
asked where the EQ:TSS one was. 

I also might have called Smedely a closet pedophile too.

Doesn't matter though. Automated responder would have to be programmed
and we all know that Soe couldn't program their way out of a wet paper
bag.

Nah I'm not bitter. Just wasted a good 2 years and countless $$$ on
the game.
