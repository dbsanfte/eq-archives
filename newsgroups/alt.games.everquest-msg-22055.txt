A few nights ago I was wandering in Crushbone and I took down a big healthy 
Orc Legionnaire. How? Like this:

I pulled him from in front of the castle with Snare. As he ran towards me, 
I DoTed him, burned him once, and then he was almost on top of me. So I 
jumped across the river. He then started to run about 50 yards to the 
bridge, while I burned him the whole way. He  came around the other side 
and... I jumped back across the river.

Would Verant consider it an exploit, do you think, that I was taking 
advantage of the fact that Orcs won't jump? I personally think it was 
tactics more that exploitation, but I am interested in hearing your 
opinions.
