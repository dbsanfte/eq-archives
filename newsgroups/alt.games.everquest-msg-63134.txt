Hate to bring bad news, but you may find that no matter what you do to your
computer it will not play EQ after SOL comes out.  To begin with if you are
running Windows 95 it will no longer be supported because of text problems,
secondly your processor may be way too small, third you will need massive
amounts of Ram and likely your video card will be too small.  You may well
be waiting til Christmas anyway.  Good luck though and hopefully I will be
proven wrong.
