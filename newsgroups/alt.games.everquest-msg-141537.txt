The main reason that the druid pet is so much more expensive than the shaman
pet is supply vs. demand, lots of druids want the spell, which is a fairly
rare drop, which makes it expensive, as compared to there being not as many
shaman (even if a greater percentage of them want the spell since it's
actually useful) and the spell being a much more common drop.

That said, I paid 2k to a guy for Nature Walker's Behest and Tunare's
Request (gimpy non-agro low level cap charm, probably 500pp normally)
together.  Since the guy I got them from was a 53 druid I figure he was just
stupid or needed money fast.

Comparable comparison in the Kunark druid spell, Regrowth of the Grove still
being in the 6-8k range IF you can find one for sale, compared to the Luclin
Shaman spell Regrowth of Dar Khura, same spell, but only in the 2k range and
there being usually one or two for sale in the bazaar.

RGC is one of the spells I feel the need to log on an alt and harass people
about trying to buy, RGC and ancient spells and to a lesser extent the
componentless eb/lev, gnome mask is good bait too.

Of course if I ever decide to actually PLAY my bard his reputation will
probably be horribly screwed, but it's still funny when there's like 4 level
54 clerics (always clerics for some reason, apparently druids, shaman and
paladins are less suceptible to this particular ailment of the dumb ass) and
I ask them what they're paying and they're like "hmm... it's only a level 54
spell and I don't really know what it does, so I won't pay more than 500pp",
then popping a copy that doesn't really exist into the auction channel at
60k to get the idiot clerics to stfu, being prepared with adequate backstory
and knowing where/who the spells drop from helps complete the illusion and
then the big kicker to people who say the price is insane: "don't like my
prices, great, join the crowd looking for someone else selling them"

Componentless eb/lev is screwed up on my server ever since some guy with
like 8 copies of each in the bank (he was a guild banker, but seriously,
wtf?) was quitting the game and bargain basemented them for like 100pp each,
ever since then no one WTB them has been paying more than like 500pp,
granted, I wouldn't either, but I don't auction for them and it's still
moronomics.
