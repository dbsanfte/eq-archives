About the mobs, have you read the new stories? There's a couple new ones.
Here, I'll paste them:

"Rumors on the Wind

<br><br>
The filthy waters lap rhythmically at the shores of The Overthere. A
well-worn boat parts the veil of lazy mist hanging still in the air as it
makes its last strides toward land. The strained hull groans softly as it
swims toward the sands, finally grating onto the shore.

A tall, tattered figure stands at the bow. His stature and the breadth of
his shoulders give away his Barbarian heritage. His eyes, gray as the
waters, flit along the sands toward the outpost looming nearby as he
assesses the immediate dangers.

<br><br>

Seemingly satisfied, he walks amidships, puts a hand on the side of his
boat, Thorn of the White Rose. He jumps over the edge to land knee-deep in
water with barely a splash or sound.

<br><br>

With that landing, Morden Rasp took another step on the path of a rumor -- 
one that set him upon the waves and one that he intends to follow to its
end. He has heard of trouble amongst the Sarnak.

<br><br>

Morden walks from the surf to a steep incline where grains of sand meet the
grass. He leaves no trace; no footprints. As his body rises up to a ledge,
he crouches in perfect relationship, his presence barely detectable.<br><br>

He sees no trace of passing patrols, only wildlife wanders nearby as the
willful rogue kneels motionless and quiet for a short time. The deep creases
in Morden's brow begin to smooth as he sees no enemies. In ferine movements,
he moves back from the ledge. On the sands once again, he turns and slips
silently back to the boat. <br><br>

"All is clear Nedaria," he says in a voice that travels on the air in soft
baritones. "It looks like we found ourselves an adequate spot. I need to
survey the area before we set up camp though. Come down."<br><br>

A hardened Erudite face peers over the side of the boat at Morden.<br><br>

"Lend me a hand?" she asks as she folds back the sleeves of her
robe.<br><br>

"I shall, but you must read my fortune tonight," he says, with a slanted
grin.<br><br>

"You never do anything for free, do you?" Nedaria huffs as she lowers the
scruffy rope ladder. <br><br>

He holds her gently as she carefully makes her descent onto the sands.
<br><br>

Morden and Nedaria turn and walk up the beach together. They are age-old
companions, moved by loyalty to one another and
adventure...anywhere.<br><br>"



And the second one:

"Bound by Exile

<br><br>

Pulling a blanket tightly about him, Morden Rasp shook off the chill of the
night air. Firelight licked the scars on his weathered cheek as he turned
his head toward the glow of the outpost in The Overthere. Two pinpricks of
violet looked back at him -- the eyes of a Dark Elf. The dark-skinned
prowler had crept around their camp for several nights, preying on any
creatures hungry enough to investigate the mellow aroma of mead and stew.

<br><br>

Nedaria sensed no ill-will from the dark elf, as evil as his innate
tendencies may be, and told Morden to leave him be; let him satisfy his
curiosity and need to hunt.

<br><br>

"He is much like us Morden," she said. "I feel he may have some part to play
here."

<br><br><br>

Tondal Di`Xevar kept still, his body pressed against the cold earth. He
shivered slightly as the wind blew silvery strands of hair across his face.
He felt the Barbarian look at him; the Erudite see into him.

<br><br>

It had been a long time since he'd felt a need for companionship, but he did
now. Many times he considered returning to his place at the outpost under
his master, Vaean the Night, even though it would be the end of him. Tondal
was tired of being alone and having no purpose.

<br><br>

As he crouched, Tondal became lost in a nightmare in his memory. He replayed
the night he chanced upon an open tome in Vaean's study; one that made clear
that he was ripening Tondal for a vile necromantic ritual. Vaean planned to
have Tondal become one of his many mindless minions. That very night, Tondal
fled the outpost while his master slept.

<br><br>

Since then, Tondal learned to live off of his wits and the fruits of Kunark,
defending himself with his sword and dark magic and calling upon the undead
to aid in his hunting.

<br><br>

But, two days ago, Tondal felt eerily drawn back to the outpost. As he
carefully crested a hill near the outpost, he spotted a boat on the shore
and two travelers of the likes he'd rarely seen. Tondal knew they were aware
of his presence, yet they did not attack or approach.

<br><br>

He crept closer this night, inexplicably desperate to talk to the male and
female. He felt confident he knew enough of the Common language to convey
his harmless interest in them.

<br><br>

Having been lost in reflection, Tondal froze as a hand gripped his shoulder.
Instinctively, he crossed his right arm in front of him, drew his sword and
pivoted on his right foot, swinging the blade in a wide arc. A shock ran up
his arm as an expert parry stopped his blade short.

<br><br>

Tondal looked up and met the steely gaze of Morden Rasp."



So those mobs are the characters in that story.
