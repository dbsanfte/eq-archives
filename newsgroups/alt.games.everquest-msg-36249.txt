Why should we flame this guy? One look at his email says it all.

Charge one: Dood speak email address.
Charge two: Name matches email - lazy lazy!
Charge three: Captitialization to separate words instead of
underscore. A dood trademark.
Charge four: AOL address. Everyone knows AOL is EVIL. They both start
with vowels. They both end in "L". VI is a "Vee" sound, if you purse
your lips slightly, it makes an "OO".

I have a bug to report too and they won't fix it. I keep dying because
MOBs attack me when I run through WC. I don't even see them, I tell
them they have to improve 1200 baud modem support, but they don't
listen...
