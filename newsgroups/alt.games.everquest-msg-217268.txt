It's more clear, to me at least, to think of hate as "decaying" over
time (Verant tacitly admitted this during the Conquest controversy).
This has the effect of making a big hate hit (a high agro heal, for
instance, or a big nuke) have a shot at gaining agro even when your
tank has been building hate for a long time (his early hits by now
forgotten).

Aruvqan:  You're a Cleric, think about the difference between
sitting immediately after casting a CHeal as opposed to waiting a
second or three, the hate from your heal fades a bit and the tank
gets a few new whacks in on the mob and so you avoid being summoned.
It's all the same mechanism.
