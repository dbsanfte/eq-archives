The fastest way to master baking is with fish rolls.

1 BatWing + 1 Fresh Fish combined in an oven or spit.

You can buy stacks of Batwings at the last Inn in East Commonlands (by
the WC zone line), and you can buy statcks of fish at the hut by the
lake in WC (near Druid Ring)

It should only take a couple ot hours (or less) to master baking (Fish
Rolls trivial at 100+), and should cost no more than 20-30pp in
materials

You won't make much money on Baking. Non of the trade skills will make
you rich.
