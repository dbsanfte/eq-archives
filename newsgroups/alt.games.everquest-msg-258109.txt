I'm tired of being called Catwoman.  I found a list of *no graphic* helms on
eqcleric that weren't no drop but it was dated more than a year ago: othmir
fur, nathsar, nightshade - but I prefer something nicer, like the *ornate
helm*.  I've never seen an ornate helmet mold in the bazaar tho *ever*.
Anyone know of any other cleric head items with no graphics?
