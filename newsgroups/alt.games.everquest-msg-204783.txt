That'll be it then: most of the decent stuff at this level comes from
quests.
You don't mention what items you currently have but using the
yardstick of the item you mentioned, off the top of my head, here
are some things you could try.

Fine Antique quests in POK: mostly not worth it cos of difficulty but
ring http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16371
corset http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16364
amice http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17966
are doable, as is this unrelated mask
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16394
(do it before they revamp nurga)

at 46 you can MQ
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16506
or the equivalent quite easily, (yeah MQ sucks, but its appropriate items
for your level you wanted, not appropriately easy to get items :) )

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7830
is like the original "long-assed quest" but if you can get a group to do
it, fine.

Work on getting your coldain rings/shawls, as they're about your
level, and look out for drops in LoY, which tend to be quite nice
for the level requirement...

None of this stuff is uber, but its appropriate for your level and its
a nice stepping stone to what comes next.
