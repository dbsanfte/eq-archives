At this point, I believe it's entirely possible that all he's really looking
for is someone to argue with.

How is it possible that you guys are so brainwashed?  Why is it impossible to
have a game that has less downtime and still meets their "mission statement"? 
KEI has no effect on that mission statement.  People who choose not to group
are one's that you aren't gonna want in your group anyway so good riddance.  I
like the people I usually group with and I like all the people in my guild.  I
don't see why we can't group with KEI and still have fun without ruining it for
you?
