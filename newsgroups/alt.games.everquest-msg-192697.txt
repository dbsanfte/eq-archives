Only if they "posts to and/or transmits through SOE's Communication
Features" the material, i.e. post it on the SOE boards or in
game. This means you are _not_ permitted (at least under that grant of
permissions) to do anything else with the material, such as making it
available on your web site.

Unless there is something else in that agreement that I've missed. Oh,
and I am not a lawyer, nor do I know anything about US contract law,
so take my opinions with a block of salt.
