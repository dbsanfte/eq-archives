Yes, this is certainly true before level 34, when Cleric heal spells
upgrades are only 5 levels ahead of druid/shaman heal upgrades, and
shamans/druids can also SOW, unlike clerics (plus do other things like
slow and DS).  However, once clerics reach level 34, they get Superior
Healing, which druids and shamans don't get till level 51, so Clerics
run away from the pack healing-wise after that (and of course get
Complete Healing at 39).
