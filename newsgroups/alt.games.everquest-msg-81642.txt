    Take this as the anecdotal snippet it is: when I was XPing in Sebilis a
long time ago, we'd frequently get a low-level enchanter in the group
(49-52). I could tell the low CHA ones from the high CHA ones by whether
they could land a mez on a Dar or higher frog with frequency. Every time I
asked them "What is your CHA" after a really good or bad string of mezzes,
the answer would be what was expected if CHA had some effect on the spell
landing.
