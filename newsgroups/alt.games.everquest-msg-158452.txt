I agree with the first.  The second I'm not so sure of.  If PoK had
come out a year and a half ago I'd have agreed with you, but as the
game is today I'm not at all sure there's anything particularly
wrong with it.  And, to be fair :), I think that the players deserve
as much credit (or blame, depending on how you view it) for how EQ
has turned out as SOE does.
