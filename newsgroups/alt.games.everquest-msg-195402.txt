Er, that was kind of the point.  We didn't exploit because we couldn't; Sony
had tuned the encounter so that you had to execute well or fail.  I rather
like the RZ fight for exactly that reason.

When we start dropping elemental mobs, we'll know that we're beating much
tougher content to get the same loot as the other guilds that have gone
before us.  So, if nothing else, we can take a little pride in that.  Small
consolation, but ya gotta look for some silver lining here.  =)
