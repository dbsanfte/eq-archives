Clerks is one of my all-time favourites. So I couldn't help but
correct you..

From the great IMDB:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/quotes

Olaf Oleeson: [singing] My love for you is like a truck, BERZERKER!
Would you like some making fuck, BERZERKER!
Jay: [snickering] That's pretty fucking funny.
Jay's Lady Friend: Did he just say "making fuck"?
