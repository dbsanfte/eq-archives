Thats funny, I think its called self-projection.  I don't care, however,
you firstly can't read your own headers, second thought they would flame
me.  I'm not in the least bit insecure.  I don't wish you to like me... 
I have seen enough of your mindless drivel to dislike you.

They have jumped all over you.  How little are you that you have no
others to support you?  If I wanted to handle you I would play the
Endless killfile game.  I want to play with you.
