Me either and in fact I think although 9 slots or more would be difficult
for them to comprehend, they could at least revamp how spell menus are used,
for instance they could offer up a triple slot all pre-loaded with a click
of a button you have your choice of Offensive, Defensive & Misc. 8 each with
a pause between the spell slot menus when choosing if the last one clicked
was in the other type of the three mentioned above, if it is another spell
from the same menu your last picked from then no delay, that would alieve
having to go save & load various spell setups and sit to watch them load
each time for nusance sake.
