Yes you are referring to "The Fantasy Trip" which were the set of
books Advance Melee, Advance Wizard, and the source book "Into the
Labyrinth." The company was Meta Games which had a lot of those little
box games, Melee started off as such and then went on to the three
books. The author was non other then Steve Jackson of GURPS fame.

Every nice, clean, simple,  logical and brutal gaming system. It's
only weakness was the high end game was terrible because you were uber
due to stat increases as you level. Easy to set up and create
characters too. We were all burned out on fantasy RPGs at the time
after AD&D. It just took to long and the rules and the charts.... 
We just burned out on fantasy, but we loved the mechanics and setting
so much even the die hard traveller players wanted to play fantasy
again.

The company went bankrupt in late 80s, Jackson tried to buy the rights
for the game but the owner wanted some outrages amount which is why he
created GURPS which is a more complicated version of Fantasy Trip.

A great game, too bad you have to go to Ebay to buy it for some high
price used. Luckily I have my copies but would love to see this
reprinted.
