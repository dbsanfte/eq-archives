Im guessing its for your necro.
Check out the equipment page on this site:
http://www.terra.es/personal2/eqnecro/
There is a full rundown of how to max out your int for a pretty low figure.
A lot of what's on the list could be soloed/duoed with a friend by your
Shaman.

Check out the rest of the site too, some very nice information there, but it
is a little out of date (No Velious/Luclin)
