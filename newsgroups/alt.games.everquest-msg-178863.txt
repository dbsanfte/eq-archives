At 34, you get Root. (CELEBRATE!)

I did root-rot more than one mob at a time in GD, on the little shelf 
where the book is now. I took on the giants and the wolves there. I had 
to keep one rooted at all times, and usually ended up aggro-kiting when 
root broke.

And yes, at 49, I soloed the Allizsneeze.. but gosh it was a bear to 
fear kite. I only did it once. (I only tried once- that was good enough!)
