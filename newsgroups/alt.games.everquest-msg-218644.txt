  Well, if you do it like I did, you hit, control-f, then alt-f, or
maybe the other way around, to bring up the "find" screen.  Then you
select the NPC you want.  Then your machine crashes to reboot, and you
get a critical error message when it restarts.  Then you log back on in
confusion, just to see if happens again.  When it does, you decided to
just find whomever the old fashioned way.

Hope this helps.
