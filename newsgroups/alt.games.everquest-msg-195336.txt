And people complain about the l33t sp33k that spews out here
sometimes. I'd love for somebody to come up with a translator for the
financial world doublespeak sometime.

I think basically what was said here is that Sony has lost money
because they were forced to cut prices on electronic products to keep
selling those products during a bad economy. They had to take the
losses from profit margins because they couldn't cut wages any more
than they have already and still keep workers at their jobs.

I guess l33t is in the eyes of the beholder.
