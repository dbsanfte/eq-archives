I interpret kill stealing to mean that someone is engaged with an enemy
and then someone else comes along and intentionally gets the npc to
attack them instead for the purpose of having the right to the loot and
the exp.  If you have done at least 50% of the damage to the npc then
even if someone else ends up killing it, you still get the exp and you
still are the only one allowed to loot its corpse.  He very likely did
you a big favor.  Playing a Barbarian Warrior myself I remember the
early levels.  Taking out a polar bear became easy but if it takes you a
while to finish the one you are attacking another one could easily
happen along and agro onto you.  Then you would end up with a dead polar
bear that you killed all by your lonesome, your health at around 50% and
another fully healthy polar bear hacking away at you.  

Also, I learned early on that even though I am 29 years old and playing
this game it is inevitable to come across characters being controlled by
12 and 13 year olds.  And from my exp with 12 and 13 year olds, they
will not respond as diplomatically as some of us would like.
