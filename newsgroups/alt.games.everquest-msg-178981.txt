Exactly. Damage bonuses don't kick in until...I think 25? 28?

KOS means that your faction is low enough with the faction that mob is
on that it will kill on sight (Hence, "KOS"). Level difference will
stay off most mobs from attacking if you're high enough above them,
but there are many mobs that ignore level difference. "Non-aggro"
means it won't aggro no matter what your faction with it is (See the
crocs in Oasis for an example). Con a mob, the first half of the
message clues to your faction with them. "Scowls, ready to attack" or
"glares threateningly" are both KOS range.

I'm not absolutely certain that the factions are totally unattached,
but I'm pretty sure they are. I haven't killed one lately, and can't
recall what faction hits pop up.

Had to remake my sig after having to format my drives for some
troubleshooting after I moved to CA. Just a bit I neglected to add...
