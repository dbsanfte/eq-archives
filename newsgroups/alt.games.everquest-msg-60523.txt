Oh, yeah, forgot about the wolf form.  The little bit I know about
being in wolf form is that it makes you amiable to the Brownies in
Lesser Faydark (who normally KOS all races), plus I think wolf form
makes you KOS in Firiona Vie (and I think wolf form is also KOS in
Cabilis--they just plain hate anyone who's not Iksar!)
