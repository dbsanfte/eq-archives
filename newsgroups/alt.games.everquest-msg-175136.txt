I wonder if it is related to the "packet loss in particular parts of a zone"
problem?  I had a problem in Cabalis for a while, near the Shaman guild.  If
I got near there, my PL would go way up, and it would go down if I backed
away.  This was reproducable, and to make sure that it wasn't just a
periodic thing whose period just happened to be how long it took my to walk
in and back out, I went so far as getting a stopwatch and my D&D dice, and
using the dice to generate a random number, waiting that many seconds, and
then move over to the Shaman guild, roll the dice to see how long I'd stay
there, and then move back...and the PL was 100% matched with the times I was
at the Shaman guild.

I've also seen this happen in Rivervale, with a region of PL near the POD.
Back off to the entrance to the tunnel to the Misty Thicket zone, and it was
fine.

The EQ servers do some weird things now and then.
