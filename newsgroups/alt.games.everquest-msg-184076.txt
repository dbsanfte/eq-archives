Looking at the responses I see that 2 people admitted to using XP (don't
remember what version).  Well, I have 3 EQ computers...Win98SE, Win2k Pro,
WinXP Home.  My friends have 2 EQ computers, Win98SE and WinXP Home.  I
believe all of us are using nVidea cards.

Only 2 computers are having this problem (along with a really annoyingly
long time to exit the game, if it exits at all)...the 2 WinXP Home machines.
