I just wish they would give some benefit to doing well at the game (no
matter how s mall).  Maybe slightly increated mana/hp regen if your
doing well.  I would love to be and a raid where the clerics where
balancing their attention between the rotation and gems.  Making that
fantastically clever gems move to get the mana to get off that last
cheal, and save the day.
I wish they had ripped off "Bubble Bobble" rather than "Dr. Mario". 
It would be interesting if enchanters could play head to head against
higher level mobs to mez them, making the game more a battle of wits
rather than abstact numbers with a discreet sucess/failure result.  It
could also make for some interesting quests, but has it is gems is
just not that fun.
