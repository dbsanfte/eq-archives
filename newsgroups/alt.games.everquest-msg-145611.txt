Rumor has it bard lull line works better than the cleric/chanter version.
As much as I love trying out unlikely strategies, I've never experimented
with this despite getting bard to 40... I suppose too many bad experiences
with cleric lull at a young age soured me on the idea until Verant decides
to fix it, if ever.

If it only got resisted 25% of the time, instead of 75%, or if it didn't aggro
mobs when resisted, then clerics would be using it all the time.  Perhaps
now that they are making clerics non-essential, they'll finally see the light
on increasing their utility here.
