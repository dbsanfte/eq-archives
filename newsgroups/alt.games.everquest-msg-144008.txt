What might be interesting would be to get rid of the hybrid classes, and
instead of true D&D-style multiclassing.  Here's how it works under 3rd
edition D&D rules:

1. When you level up, you can choose to go up one level in your current
class (or one of your classes, if you have already multiclassed), OR you can
add level 1 of a new class.

2. Your overall level is the sum of the levels of all your classes.  So, in
D&D, where max level is 20, you can't be a 20 Fighter/20 Wizard, because
that would be a level 40 character.  You could be at most a 10 Fighter/10
Wizard (or any combination that adds up to 20).

3. Abilities and stats are basically the sum of those of all your classes.
E.g., a 10 Fighter has an attack bonus of +10.  A 10 Wizard has an attack
bonus of +5.  So, a 10 Fighter/10 Wizard would have an attack bonus of +15
(which is better than what a 20 Wizard with have, but not as good as what a
20 Fighter would have, which makes sense).  That Fighter/Wizard could wear
plate mail, but when casting Wizard spells, would still suffer the penalty
that Wizards suffer if they wear armor while casting.

Pretty much all combinations are allowed, except where alignment
restrictions prevent it.  Paladins have to be Lawful, for example, and
Barbarians cannot be Lawful, so you can't have a Barbarian/Paladin
multiclass.  There are also some order restrictions (e.g., I seem to recall
that if a Monk levels up in any other class, he can no longer level up any
more as a Monk, so you basically have to take all the Monk levels you want
consecutively).

If your classes aren't all within one level of each other, there is an XP
penalty.  Various races have "favored classes" that don't count when
checking for an XP penalty.  E.g., I believe Fighter is a favored class for
Dwarves, so a Dwarf Fighter/Something does not have an XP penalty (a Dwarf
Fighter/Something/Somethingelse would still have an XP penalty if the two
non-Fighter classes were not kept within a level of each other, though).

At first, it might seem that everyone would play some 10/10 or 7/7/6
multiclass, but generally, those turn out to be too week.  However, things
like 19/1 or 18/1/1 or 18/2 are interesting.  They are high enough in the
main class to be useful at high levels, but the multiclassing adds
versatility.  (I don't recall for sure, but I *think* that it is your class
level that determines the effectiveness of level-dependent spells, not
character level, so in EQ terms, a 51 Warrior/9 Shaman would cast SOW, for
example, that goes at level 9 SOW speed, not level 60 SOW speed).

Something like this in EQ could be interesting for some classes...especially
Clerics, since Clerics get CH at 39, so you could be a 39 Cleric/21 Other
and still have CH.  Say, 39 Cleric/21 Druid, and you'd have personal ports,
and invis vs. non-undead.  Probably the main benefit in EQ would be to go
59/1, taking the second class just to get the ability to use items that are
restricted to that class.  E.g., I could see going 59 Wizard/1 Shadow Knight
instead of 60 Wizard to get access to an insta-click invisibility item.

Hmmm...there's no level restriction on the Cleric epic, is there?  Bet there
would be a lot of people going for 59 Whatever/1 Cleric, and then going for
the Cleric epic.  I suppose that if they put in multiclassing, they'd have
to put class level restrictions on most good items, so that taking 1 level
of X doesn't get you the good X items.

Taking a level of Bard might be popular, to get the ability to cast while
running, assuming that applied to all spells, not just Bard songs.  A
Wizard/Bard or Druid/Bard would not need snare or jboots/SOW to kite!

So, if EQ had 3E D&D-style multiclassing, what combinations would be good?
Or would, in general, giving up levels on your main class cripple you for
the endgame?
