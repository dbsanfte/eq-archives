On Druzzil Ro, this event consisted of level 60s killing every werewolf as
soon as it spawned. Nobody got hurt, because the WW didn't live long enough
to target anyone. I managed to cast root on one blue WW, and it was
immediately nuked by someone.

In EK, it was a lot better. I made over 1,000 pp that night as a level 18
druid. There was still a lot of the highest level players farming no-drops
and auctioning looting rights, but there were enogh "uninteresting" MOBs of
all levels -spread out so not as dangerous- to be good exp & loot. .
