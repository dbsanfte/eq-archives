Congrats, but being a noob is about more than postcounts, and in fact
is used in this context to show that despite your status as a regular,
you are still pretty damn green when it comes to figuring out what
people say, and why, on usenet, when you claim that the quote below is
somehow not an accusation.

I'll put it another way - either green, or freakishly dense, if you
think posting...

>>>Kind of funny how this Vladesch showed up out of nowhere defending the
>>>original poster who just 'disappeared'

...is NOT an accusation by insinuation.

So if that is what you based your accusation of me lying on, then I'd
suggest you find a different tack.

I don't think my opinion on when newbishness wears off *in general* is
important - it so happens, however, that in your case five+ years is
apparently not enough, if you think Danni's comment was anything less
than an implied accusation of Vladesch being a Bogg sock.

Incorrect. The idea that you think posting the above quote was just
some idle innocent speculation makes you a noob. Here's what you said,
in case you forgot:

>  That wasn't an accusation, Ben. 

...when it so very obviously was, if not explicit.


> You might very well believe that

I would suggest people who's ability to comprehend meanings, both
explicit and implicit, is as poor as yours apparently is will probably
still be noobs twenty years and a hundred thousand posts from now.
Especially if you still think its because you "disagree" with me. Much
easier to just claim that rather than look at the actual evidence
posted, yes? Especially when you have no answer for it?

Even now, by going out and getting your post count from google, you
show minimal ability to figure out what people are saying, or
"insinuating" as I was in this case. Do you think I would call you a
noob because you haven't POSTED enough? What would be the point of
that?

So, not only did Danni's insinuation go over your head, but mine did
as well. For you, I suppose I will have to remember to spell
everything out explicitly from now on. Critical reading doesn't appear
to be your strong point.

Acts like one. Thinks like one. Posts like one. Whether they are
*actually* one is not necessary. Some newcomers pop on and immediately
seem to understand the dos and don'ts, and fit right in.

Whatever. You tossed about several accusations with no basis and
refuse to give backing to all but the one above. Are you admitting
when you said I was telling you what to post you were lying then? How
about when you accused me of being hypocritical, without any examples?
Do you believe those aren't flames just because they are less
insulting?

Guess you're not as far out of that sty as you thought you were, hmm?
You might want to wash your hands before you eat....
