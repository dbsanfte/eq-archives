I believe its random chance, checked whenever bucaneer is supposed to 
despawn. 4 hours is nothing. Camp it for 18 hours and you might have a 
decent chance of him spawning.  I remember some grewling stories and
experiences about waiting for him to spawn. Best bet is to go do something 
else in zone thats close enough that you'll be able to have him on track if 
he spawns, like gargoyles, goblins, or gornit if you can take him....and 
just hope you get lucky.  Atleast you can avoid the insane boredom. 

Supposedly Verant made the probability of him spawning better, awhile back,
if thats any consolation.
