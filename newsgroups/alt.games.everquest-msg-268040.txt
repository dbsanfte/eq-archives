Did I gimp my character by not ever bothering to level up artisan? The
only artisan thing I did was the room cleaning quest on the IoR. I'm a
level 16 summoner and level 2 artisan now, and if I had to go back to
farm resource nodes in the noob zones it would suck pretty bad, not to
mention take forever.

But to be honest, I really have no desire whatsoever to craft stuff.
Mostly because of the time investment. It just doesn't sound like a
fun use of my limited free time. I already have a real life job and
don't need another one, especially a  data entry job where I click on
logs and rocks all day.

Everyone in my guild is at least a level 11 or higher tradeskiller of
some kind in addition to their adventuring levels. Am I the only
person in EQ2 that thinks tradeskilling sucks? Bottom line is that I
have no intention of putting in the time required to do so... the
question then is am I gonna suffer in game as a result?
