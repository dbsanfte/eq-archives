To be honest, I don't get it.  How does eqw affect game play at all?
I mean, technically, diablo2 mods are against the permitted TOS of the
game, but that doesn't really bother anyone.

The biggest difference I found when playing with eqw was that
switching between full-screen and windowed mode was almost
instantaneous rather than accompanied by a 1-2s delay.
