Yup. I have seen tailors "preying" on the ignorance of folks who don't
know the HQ hopper hides can be used just like the HQ bear skins for
making backpacks... Had someone /auctioning for them in Shadeweaver's
only offering 5pp each. Guy got rather pissed when I /ooc'd that they
are just as rare as HQ bear skins and can be used to make something
just as valuable. Chewed me out for costing him more money.......
