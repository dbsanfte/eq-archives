Yes, click on the FAQ link. Your current EQ account does NOT merge with the
UbiSoft one. Nothing on characters moving, and they want you to buy all of
the old world all over again. and PoP can be used either with UbiSoft
servers or with the current servers/old account. Your choice. To be released
Nov. 21.

On a positive note, you can sign up for the free beta now... even the
English needs testing, they claim.
