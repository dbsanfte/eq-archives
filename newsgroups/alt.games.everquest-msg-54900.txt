And beyond. I've got a druid alt at 19 right now in NK, which is a
soloists paradise. Shopping list right now includes Guard Shilster (long
respawn, about 20 minutes or so). I'm bound right inside the Qyenos tower
so kill Shilster, Gate, turn in helm earns me one solid blue bubble. Ring
back to karana, med up, and I'm off to find 2 or 3 Scythe bugs while
waiting for Shilster to repop. At 19 the Scythes are either even or lvl
18, and -excellent- exp. An even con scythe is a tough fight for a soloing
druid, but would probably just be candy to a necro. I'm averaging a yellow
an hour in NK - more if I can find a chanter and get some crack.
