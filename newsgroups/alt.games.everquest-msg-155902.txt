I have 2 Questions....

First, I have a 19 Druid, 16 Bard, and just started a 4 Shaman. Is it worth
it for me to buy planes of power now?

Second, I have not been playing for a few monhts due to a move and other
business in the summer and found out that there are spells and songs for
levels 60 to 65. Does PoP increase the number of levels from 60 to 65?

Thanks,

M.
