I guess that EMarr is a newbie server then.  Of course item prices on 
Emarr seems to be out of whack with many other servers.

I'd be shocked if there are not any number of level 65 players on Stromm 
with alts that are in their 50s.

The difference is that many of the older servers were started by

it, again, meaning that people did not start from scratch on the new 
server.
