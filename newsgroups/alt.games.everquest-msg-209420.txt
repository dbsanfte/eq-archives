Yeah, true, but it's just a reputation thing, and one that only a
small few of the rogues created. The fact that there are so many
rogues out there who don't seem to know how to evade doesn't help
much, either. Once had a level 35 rogue in my group that just couldn't
seem to shake aggro. I asked him if he was evading, to which he
replied after several minutes of silence "What's that?".
