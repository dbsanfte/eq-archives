So play a druid or maybe one of the other classes that people don't complain
about, like necromancer. Just for the record, a druid is one weak assed
ranger until they hit 14. A necro is a killing machine from the start.

You have 8 slots and 20 servers. Not like there is a shortage of open space.

BTW: If you have been playing since January and are 35 now, you may be
cruising a little on the slow side.

0-10 is inevitable. I mean no loss of experience points or anything.

10-14 may be a little slow if you don't find an experience group.

Around 14<?> you should hit Paudal Caverns. Going from ~14 to ~26 should
just be two long nights or weekend.

If you add it up, my guess would be less then 70 hours total playing to get
to mid twenties for most characters. I mean you could probaby do it in 10
hours or 120 hours, but 70 seems about right.

Your way of looking at it is a ranger is just a weak druid with a bow. That
ain't so weak. If you play your ranger like "a weak druid with a bow" you do
OK.

But by all means try a different class.
