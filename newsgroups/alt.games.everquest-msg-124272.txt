Scout Scalps drop from Deathfist Scouts, They are quite difficult to get
as drops are rare and Scouts are not plentiful. Add in the factor that
many others are hunting the same mob. Scouts walk back and forth between
the DF Camps North of the river, and also can be found South of the
river near the stone pillar at the branch in the path. They can spawn
anywhere down that side path as far as the DF Camp, Be prepared to run
back and forth between the North and South spawns, and to have the
guards KS your mob at the last second.... Results are not great, so
maybe you would be better off putting your efforts into levelling! The
cap and bracers are not as good as raw silk items.

Having said that, I completed the quest earlier today! Takes a lot of
patience, but then the quests are what I enjoy about the game!
