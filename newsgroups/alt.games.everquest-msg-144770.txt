My guild was busy with a raid the other day, and they were telling
people to get in raid channel and giving them what I assume was a
password to get on the channel ??    I didn't want to have someone
take the time to give me an explainatin at the moment since they were
all pretty busy with the raid ( to low level to join in ).......how do
you get to or activate a raid channel ?
