Here is a formula that seems to work reasonably well for calculating the
success rate.

Success rate = (1.15*(Skill+Modifiers)) - (Trivial - 70)

Trivial on the boning is 50ish.

1.15*(50+0.05*50)-(50-70) = 80.375

So, a failure rate of about 20% is what would be expected.  In order to get
down to a 5% failure rate, you have to be a fair amount above the trivial
level of the item in question.
