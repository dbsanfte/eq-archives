As you said, and another respondee, not trying to argue the merits of it,
just describing it.  The system the E'ci Public raiders use.

Raids must be led by one of the designated raid leaders to count.   Boss
mobs are generally worth a set amount of points, between 1 and 5, depending
on the difficulty of the target, the importance of the target, and the
amount of time required to take down the target. (Do you have to fight your
way in somewhere?)  Every member of the raid recieves the same points for
attending.  If bonus points are awarded for any reason (Perfect kill, first
successful kill of the mob, anything really) they are given to every member
in attendance.  No favorites.   Any penalties given out are given to the
specific person.  (/quit to avoid faction without permission, being a
dumbass and training the raid, bidding more points than you had available,
etc)

All done on a bid system.  Highest bidder takes the item, if two or more tie
on the amount bid, they roll to see who spends the points and acquires the
item.

Sometimes an item will be "suggested" for certain classes, but not enforced.

Very, very rarely will an item be allowed only to a specific class.  (Only
time I can remember it happening was the Bow of Doom from Doomshade.  A
shadowknight wanted to take it for a "range slot item with good hp" over a
ranger who would use it as an uber weapon and massive DPS boost.  I (and
probably others) pushed the raid leader with a few tells, and in the end she
declared it to be a ranger only bid.)
