I met a guy named Nitrus Oxide and asked him if he laughed
a lot ... he didn't get it. So I asked him if he thought he was
really fast ... he asked me why would he ? Now I'm no chemist,
but other than laughing gas and drag racing, anybody here know
another use for Nitrous Oxide ? If you're gonna use a 'clever' name
at least know why it's clever ...
