Actually for the levels they intended it for, the warrens
loot is not that bad, the difficulty is, People don't make
that many erudites, and even when they do they get the hell
out of Odus, because that is what all the player guides say
to do, as they were written before the Warrens.  If you look
at the loot, it's designed for Erudites, it's mostly caster
and hybrid loot.  But Erudites while stylishly and int wise
make good SK, they have poor strength, are night blind,
etc.  They don't have the Wisdom of other races to be
clerics and paladins.  Traditionally the hunting in Odus
sucked, so people shy away from the Erudite race.  I tried
several times to get into the warrens around the level 5 and
6 they claim can start hunting there with my necro, but if
you don't have a group, you die at those levels, So like
everyone else before me, I got a friend to TP me out of Toxx
forest to somewhere I can fight and gain experience and find
groups if I want to.

For people to utilize the Warrens, they are going to need to
get people to Utilize the rest of Odus.  Toxx forest might
just be one of the darkest zones in the game, which works Oh
so great since the starting races are night blind, and the
zone is full of wandering mobs /boggle VI.  Yes there are
fire beetles, but a fire beetle eye, doesn't even begin to
cut through the gloom, even with Ultravision, you basically
need an additional light source in this zone.  At least with
Paineel, they gave a newbie zone where you don't need to run
out to Toxx forest immediately.  It's not that the Warrens
is a bad zone, but that people don't make characters in the
area to Utilize it.
