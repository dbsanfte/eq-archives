Semi-related, and another reason to read what those little boxes are telling
you, my guild was intentionally trained while prepping for a raid on Friday
(ironically, we figured out it was to slow us down so we wouldn't make it to
what they thought our *next* target was going to be, a target we hadn't even
considered and wouldn't have done that night no matter what).

So I cast the level 14 rez on the guy that trained us with my twink cleric.

Sadly, I don't think he even noticed, cause he thanked me for the rez.  :P
