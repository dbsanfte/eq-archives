I still have traders hidden so I will never know when someone is standing in 
front of me...or vice-versa.  The machine with my perma-trader also has my 
EQ2 perma-trader (well, daily trader since they still can't seem to keep 
their servers up longer than 24 hours in EQ2) so I do everything I possibly 
can on both games to lessen the memory load.
