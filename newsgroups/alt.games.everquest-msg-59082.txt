I had to look it up.  For boring spells like charm I just find the spell,
mem it, put it where it belongs in my spell book, then forget the
details...like their names.  Man, how am I supposed to know that an Agacerie
is a charm and Glamour of Kintaz is a mez?   I got them confused...I knew
that Glamour wasn't what it obviously SHOULD be...either a faction or CHA
buff, so I thought it was charm.  I saw Boltran's Agacerie (same icon) but
thought that was the improved mez.  BZZZT, wrong.  Glamour is the mez, and
despite the fact you can't mez Kael giants they get just a tad ticked if you
attempt to cast it on them. :p   Weird-assed words and identical icons are a
bad combination.  Only one person in 12 died in our avg level 53 raid, AND
IT WASN'T ME, so it's all good. <g>

At level 54 I had very little luck charming giants around the arena.  Hell,
I couldn't even slow the buggers.  At 55 I had an easier time slowing, but
like I said, I didn't get a chance to charm.  Yes, memming spells is a lot
faster as a caster, but even doing /book 8 as a first step from standing I
wasn't able to get my cursor to the spell, then the spell to the casting bar
anywhere near fast enough.  I AM looking forward to my next Kael run
though...this time I'll remember to have charm memmed. <g>
