Heh, personal playstyle preferences aside, how many spells do you think a
pre-10 wizard needs to keep memorized?  One.  Their best DD -- maybe your
shielding spell, but that's certainly not necessary.

Nuke Nuke Nuke Nuke Nuke.  OOM.  Whack guard.  Mem Shock spell.  Nuke Nuke
Nuke Nuke Nuke.  OOM.  Whack guard ...You get the idea.  Not terribly
exciting, but terribly fast.
