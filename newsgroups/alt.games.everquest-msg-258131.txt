Velium Etched Helm, you know the dirt common one from Velks. (Usually
drops two at a time from one of the named spiders there.) It has no
graphic on my warrior. Not really great stats for a Cleric, but in
your case the stats aren't totally horrible, you look like you could
use some STR... and the STA certainly wouldn't hurt. You'll be losing
some AC, Saves, Mana, and WIS though. Shouldn't hurt you too bad, and
you can always swap it out for the one you have now, when you need to.
