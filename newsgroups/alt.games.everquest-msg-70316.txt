Solo'd my Barbarian Beastlord up to lvl 9 and ran to halas for
training.  Spent 5 - 9 in Blackburrow dodging trains.  Oh - ran to
Qeynos for the gnoll tooth quest several times as well.

I now have a little puppy warder!  Cute little bugger too.  When I
buff him he's an even con - I think we're going to get along famously.
