These drop a lot off the golems, also have other strange things like rotbone
stuff.

There is also a bag on the floor which looks like a glove and is a 100%WR
container, 4 slots with a combine button. Never been able to find out what
this is for either. Maybe the shackles, rusty arms and 2 rotbone items can
be combined in it but I am sure the container is only from Small items so
probably wouldn't fit. I read somewhere it may be that you combine the four
keys in the container to make a master key but unsure if someone ever tried
it and I have only ever had three keys at one time so haven't been able to
try

Other than that I love the zone. I usually go with a pally, cleric,
me(chanter) and couple of wizards and PBAoE it all. Amazing exp.
