"Pulling" is shorthand meaning "Leading to ambush".  This is a rather
ancient tactic, used by hunters and warriors forever.

"Splitting" aka "Confusing and/or outwitting your enemies so that you
can defeat them in detail" is also a very old and well used tactic.

Frontal assault is never the first choice of a competent commander.
It requires overwhelming force to be confident of success and usually
entails very heavy losses on the part of the attacking forces.  Also,
it is exactly what the enemy is trying to limit you to doing, generally
it is not wise to allow your opponent to dictate your strategy/tactics.

Yep.  And in quite a few movies as well.  You've never seen one of the
"good guys" lead "bad guys" into an ambush?  And I like the concept of
a Monk as puller.  I have no difficulty at all imagining:
Jackie Chan slips around the corner ahead of his allies, disappearing
from sight.  The allies arrange themselves for the ambush, glancing
nervously at one another and nervously fingering their weapons.
Suddenly there're great roaring and crashing sounds off screen,
everybody steels themselves for combat... our hero, looking bruised and
battered comes flying around the corner and throws himself to the
ground behind some convenient obstruction (i.e. FD) while Andre "the
Giant" steps up with a maul in one hand and a wickedly gleaming blade
in the other and plants himself squarely in the path of the onrushing
beast, raining fearsome blows upon it with all of his might... some
actor none of us has ever heard of pops up wearing Spock's ears and
a green surcoat over chainmail and begins to pepper the monster with
arrows, several more bowman quickly join in as Andre shouts for all
to join the fight and a motley assortment of fighters rush forward
to battle as colored lights begin to sparkle around shadowy figures
in the background... a soft blue-white glow forms around Andre and
quickly brightens to an almost blinding brightness beore fading to
show him with his wounds magicly erased, suddenly we see Jackie launch
a flying kick from the side as he comes to repay the beating he took
on the way in... multiple colored balls of light and bolts of energy
begin raining upon the monster from the hands of the magi who have
now stepped up out of the shadows... various extras are seen being
knocked flying by the beast as it writhes and rages in frustrated
agony, until at the last, with many of the fighters lying battered
on the ground, and the beast obviously nearing its end, our hero picks
himself up off the floor one more time and launches a flurry of blows
that end the battle.  In the echoing silence that follows you slowly
become aware of the faint moans of the wounded and see some of the
magi moving slowly from one combatant to another, healing their wounds
and returning vitality to the fallen...

This one I'll grant you.  :)

And these last also, dead on.
