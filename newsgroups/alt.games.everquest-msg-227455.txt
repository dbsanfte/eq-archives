I don't care for spam either, but as a Tank class ( 65 SK ) if Im in a
pickup group I do insist that the healer ( cleric druid shammy ) do macro
there heals, its a little unnerving to be at 1 red bubb and wondering
whether or not that heal is coming, should I leech, tap or what ? just to
see a "CH inc stay in range blah blah blah" gives you the confidence that
all is going well.

Wizards should ALWAYS macro, all they do is go /auto on a grp or raid
member, go drink beer and have a smoke, occasionaly pop back to keyboard to
throw a nuke or 2 =)
