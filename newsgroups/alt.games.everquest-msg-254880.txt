All player characters in EQ are only 3 inches (or so) tall as far as the
collision detection goes (Yes, I know they look taller, especially if
they're grown).

This means while you can't walk past a character, but you can jump past
them.

Usually I can walk through NPCs, but I'll jump past them sometimes too.
