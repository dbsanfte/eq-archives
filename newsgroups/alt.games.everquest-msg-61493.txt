I would suggest crushbone. Very close to Kelethin, one of the major hubs of
the world. Good place for tradeskilling too. CB is a very easy dungeon to
hunt in, it's rather small so running to the zone is very possible. My 27
ranger left when dinging 20 to head for kunark and my 17 wizard is currently
grouping in the throne room and he'll probably stay to 20 too.

The loot is not insanely good, but the centurions drop crushbone belts and
the legionaires drop CB shoulderpads, both can be handed in in Kaladin, only
a ten minute walk through the butherblock mountains.
At 14, as you are, the exp you get from the shoulderpads is very good,
seeing you also got the exp from killing the lego.
