You just described one of the reasons why I'm a theist (much to the
dismay of a staunch atheist friend of mine).  Lack of free will makes
the universe ultimately meaningless, a state of existance I'm not
willing to accept (at a psychological level -- I have non-psychological
reasons for believing in god, too).

My atheist friend's typical counter-argument is that the complex and
thus unpredictable nature of the universe means the illusion of free
will is sufficient.  I don't buy that argument.  Either the universe
is ultimately meaningless, or it's not.  Either we're automatons
(admittedly extremely complex and unpredictable ones), or we're not.

I think free will could only exist in a universe with a god which is
capable of living outside the laws of the universe as we know them.
In fact, when I hear the phrase, "man was created in god's image", I
like to translate that to, "god has free will and gave man the same
gift".

In fact, I also believe god is omnipotent and omniscient.  I know
from a logical perspective that should make true free will impossible,
but at that point I just have to assume we're too limited to understand
why it's possible.

Of course, none of this changes the fact that I'm anti-religious, at
least when it comes to the "big time" religions like christianity,
judaism, islam, etc.  I think to be religious is almost a shameful
state, a waste of the mind god gave you that's capable of thinking
for itself and determining right and wrong without the influence of
obvious mythology.  For those preparing the flame throwers, keep in
mind that I'm not against spirituality.
