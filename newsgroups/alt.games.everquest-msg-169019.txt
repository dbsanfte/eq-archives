Guess what? You arent going to get shit, as you shouldnt. You aren't
entitled to jack. Ever read the EULA (End User Liscensing Agreement)?
Im thinking you havent. Whether or not you realize it, you've agreed
to them not having any liability for downtime...

"We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from
any causes beyond our reasonable control. Further, we cannot and do
not promise or ensure that you will be able to access your Account
whenever you want, and there may be extended periods of time when you
cannot access your Account."

Quoted directly from the EULA. Every time you click OK, legally you
are saying - "Verant, its ok the servers are down and I cannot play."
(among other things).

You have 2 options at this point my friend: 1) deal with it and accept
it as part of the game - as all on line games will do this or... 2)
cancel your account. You have no other legal recourse.

Ok - none of us like downtime but its part of the picture. Deal with
it or don't play. Maybe during the next downtime, you can enlighten
yourself with thier EULA (which is posted on thier web site).
