I have no idea, but that's a very well-thought question.

I met a level 40 rogue in Neriak the other night getting his
note for his epic.  He had 200 PP skill, so he figured ,
"Why not?"

He had to go back again later after Stanos ate both
the top and bottom halves of the note and said, "Come
back when you're a bit wiser in the ways of the world."
