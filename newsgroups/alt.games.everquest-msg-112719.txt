You can gain spell skill level casting on ANYTHING.
You can make money looting ANYTHING (assuming they're not totally empty).

Solution:  go back to your very first hunting ground and start slaughtering
everything you see, using your spells to do it.  Loot everything.  Sell
everything.

Quite honestly, if after an hour you haven't made a decent amount of skill
and cash (cash enough for level 4 spells at least), you're doing something
wrong.

Suggested spells you can IGNORE:
Level 1
Lull
Minor Shielding (though I think this is one of the 2 spells you get as a
newbie)
Taper Enchantment
Weaken (sucky spell line altogether)
Reclaim Energy (might want to buy it later, though at 57 I think I've used
it only once since I bought it 2.5 years ago)
Minor Illusion (buy it later when you have cash...illusions are fun :) )

Level 4
Enfeeblement (another less than useful line)
Illusions (see Minor Illusion)
Haze...if you don't have it yet, don't bother, you get an upgrade at 12
Tashan...no huge rush, buy it when you can afford it...by level 13 is ok

Level 8
Illusions
Alliance - no rush unless you're doing Moggok quest
Bind Sight - cute spell but rarely used
Enchant - if you aren't going to do jewelcraft don't buy the spells.  That
way, if someone bugs you to "enchant some bars for you" you can honestly say
you can't.  Of course, if they want to buy the spell FOR you...well.... <g>
Sentinel - NEVER EVER BUY THIS SPELL UNLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HATE YOU.
Soothe - rarely used, an upgrade to Lull.  This is a pulling tool and
enchanters try to avoid being pullers when possible.
