I dont ever intend to make a trip to luclin just to shop. I will use my mule
for buying and selling, and keep my money with him. Whenever I want to shop,
I do it with my mule. The only time my main chars need to wait around for
scions if to transfer money/items, and Ill just bind my druid in bazaar for
that.
