I've been with druids who've spawned that mob three times now.  Took
a couple hours on average.

Druid in wolf form would go down there and pull a single mob from inside
the underwater tower (not the ones on top) and drag it up top where we'd
make mincemeat out of it in a little fear kite, then repeat.

Wolf form is important, as it prevents you from having to pull every goblin
in the place.  You can't snare till you get em out of the tower area, or they
will take the time to gather friends.

Some of the tainted spawn the corrupted, some don't, this means you want
to make sure you have good mana at the end of any tainted kill, in order to
be prepared for the corrupted.  Fortunately, even the corrupted is hardly
a threat.

I'm pretty sure about the "not on top" information, then again, I never go
down to the tower myself, so I could be misunderstanding what is going
on in there.
