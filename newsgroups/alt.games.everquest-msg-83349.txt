Hi all,

I was just wondering if there are any quests out there that a low level dark
elf wizard in the Neriak area could do. I tried collecting the fire beetle
eyes to turn into some guy only to have him con dubious to me and I couldn't
do the quest. Any suggestions of where there's good quest exp, preferably
near Neriak.
