Why?

Why in God's name would you want it?

This is one thing I don't understand.  The HP Tunic
has an AC of 14.  FOURTEEN!  That's like a Scarab
shell BP or a Sarnak Emblazoned Tabbard.  Even
a Brigadine Tunic from Guk is better.

If I had a BP that was +255 to all my stats but
5 AC, I'd never wear it.  Unless that +255 included
Resists....

Spend the money on a Barbed Ringmail Tunic
or Ceremonial Iksar BP. Or at least try to talk the seller
down to 150 pp...
