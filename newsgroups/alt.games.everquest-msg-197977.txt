    No, as the phrase "family-style guilds" doesn't appear in or above what
I posted. However, now that you mentioned it....

    Recently, we've started moving towards a more points-based rewards
system. Part of that move was posting the attendance figures for the month,
and breaking it down into three classes. Class one is Full Time. These
people have at least 80 hours played in raids over the past four weeks, and
also in weeks two to five (so last five weeks excluding last week). For the
math challenged, that's 20 hours per week or about three hours per day,
every day of the week. Class two is Part Time, they have to average 10 hours
per week in the same time periods. Casual is everyone else.

    Of the 125 people who raided during the period in question (out of 160
tagged mains total - and that number says something too), 57 were Full Time,
33 were Part Time, 35 were Casual. Everyone on that list is PoV/PoS flagged.

    Not all guilds operate like we do. I know that over 70% of our guild
would be detagged if we used Afterlife's strict raiding requirements, for
example. But "uber" does not equal "no life", not for everyone.

    Oh, and I'm full time by the skin of my teeth. ;-)

    James
