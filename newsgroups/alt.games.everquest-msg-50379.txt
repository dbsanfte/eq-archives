I gues you haven't been to nToV where the 3 rogue group gets the exp
from a red mob every few minutes. A decent run can net several k plat as
well as over a yellow of exp. Add in a 'minimum %' of exp for each mob
killed, spread it around the raid, and everyone benefits. As it is now
some get major exp gain on a raid, and some (pullers, MTs etc.) get
major exp loss.

The 'easiest' sticking plaster solution however, is just a raid-invite
yes/no box for a specific raid communication channel, which is what I
expect will happen.
