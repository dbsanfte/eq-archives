Treat the pet as another group member.  If the pet does more
damage than any of the other group members (which is more
than half if you're soloing with a pet) he gets XP as if he was in
the group.  Otherwise, the pet takes approximately 1%.

The core issue is that the pet can not outdamage all of the
group's members *individually* not as a group.  If the pet is
the leading damage provider in a group (more than half if
you're soloing, more than one third in a duo, more than one
quarter in a trio, etc.) it takes XP as if it was another player.

A pet is a pet is a pet...
