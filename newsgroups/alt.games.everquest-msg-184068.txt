I'm not bizbee, but here goes anyway.

As far as I know, you *can't* just create a place for truffles to grow.

They only grow underground in the roots of certain trees.  Also, they
only grow there once a year.  Some places hunt with dogs and some with
pigs, from what I understand, just like they always have.
