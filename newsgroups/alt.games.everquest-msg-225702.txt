Ouch! Reminds me of the time I first visited Befallen and went into that
room that has the pit trap as soon as you enter it. What kind of foul mood
do you suppose those level designers were in when they created those little
surprises for us?

Anyway, I had always heard that Vox raids were tougher than Naggy, but never
got a straight answer why. Thanks for making it more concrete. Makes me feel
better about my decision to skip out on the experience ...
