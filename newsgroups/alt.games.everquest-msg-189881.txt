I'm a poor bum in the upper regions, but anything below 1k plat I simply
sell to vendors considering it's not worth my time to dump it on a vendor.
/shrug. My grand total now exists of minus 7000 because I've lend a couple
of k from a friend. I expect to return it to him next week, 2 weeks after
the loan, and that's mostly because there were many raids in between or it
would be this week :).

As a rule of thumb, don't expect your first 1000 before level 40 or so.
Don't expect to break 10k before ~55. After that it depends on your guild
and playstyle what your income will be. Some I've seen have spells and items
on their mules for hundreds of thousands plat before they even hit 60,
others stay below 20k for the rest of their lives. A few start to dig into
tradeskills and make fortunes , but that's usually only for druids who can
farm the best :).

As for BIG cash items, the most expensive ones I've seen so far were
Manastone (350k just before SoL) which no longer drop and are thus in a
limited supply on a given server and ornate molds/patterns (up to 250k for
the plate BP) from tier3+ pop planes.

Basically anything above 50kpp is about the best money can buy for those
slots. Anything better is usually no drop.
