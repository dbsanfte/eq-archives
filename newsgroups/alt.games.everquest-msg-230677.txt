Marus Seru works fine for soloing a warrior as long as the greyhoppers 
stay dark blue.  They are trivial to kill, but are social.  Very easy to 
solo them at 50% health, even if you do get an occasional add.  At level 
30 or so, you can hit Rathe Mountains, and kill the giant skeletons, very 
easy to kill on 50% health, with no buffs, I can do 2 or 3 before even 
having to bandage up.
