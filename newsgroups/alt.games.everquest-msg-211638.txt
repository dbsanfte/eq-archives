Allakhazam does have info on most, if not all of the various ways to 
access the various planes.  As for the charm, any of the trials in PoJ 
that give access to PoV/PoS will enhance the charm by one on most stats.  
Those are all strictly single group trials, but, they do require very 
good DPS to complete.  If you complete all of the PoJ trials, you gain 
access to the Tribunal.  For most of the flags beyond PoV/PoS there are 
usually two methods, one is a full on raid on some mob, the other is 
usually a quest of some type, that usually requires at least one group.
