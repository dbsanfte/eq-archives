You'd spend a peridot to solo in Blackburrow?

Well, my wild-assed guess would be 5 minutes.  They'd probably be dead by 
then, admittedly.

But sometimes when you're fighting armies of greens, you suddenly realize 
that you're low on health and mana, and are actually going to have to run 
to the zone.  Even when you're level 50.  It usually means you did 
something stupid, admittedly, like pulled 12 gnolls when you should have 
restrained yourself to 8, but what do you really think the odds are of 
getting a 49+ cleric to come rez you in blackburrow?  Not to mention, then 
you have to admit to the cleric that you died in blackburrow because 
there might be someone medding at the zone and you didn't want to train 
them... So you summon your horse and make for the zone.  It'd be nice if 
you manage to get a /shout TRAIN! off, but that's just not always 
possible.

What I always love, though, Is when I'm running around corners and through 
doors, and I manage to /shout Train! and some fool /shouts back, "To 
where?" 

Umm, I'm sorry, I'm a bit too busy to answer that... Just open your 
feckin' eyes and clear the tracks, all right?
