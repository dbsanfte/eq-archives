How? I can't think of any possible exploit or advantage I would gain.
They are only good for one thing.

I can sell them but not give them to an alt. Doesn't that just
unbalance it? I haven't tried but I bet I could give it to another
player you could in turn give it to my alt. To stop trading them SOE
could put the NO TRADE label on. But the LORE stopping you putting it
in the shared bank but allowing you to sell it doesn't make sense.
