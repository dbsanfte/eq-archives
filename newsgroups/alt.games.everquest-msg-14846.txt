Nope we can't be bothered.

Actually I don't bother with noobs. If I am passing through a zone where
they are fighting I just ignore them, even if they are yelling their fool
heads off for help. Last time I helped a noob with a mob when he asked for
help, he bitched at me for stealing the kill. I told him that when you ask
for the help of a 56 warrior with a level 20 mob he will kill it in 1 round
and you will loose the exp. He didn't want to hear it and kept on bitching
,"/ignore noob 01" and go on my way, ignoring all pleas for help from noobs.
