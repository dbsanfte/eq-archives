Hello!  I have played 3 of the above race/class combos (SK, RNG, BRD)
and to me the bard is the most fun, followed by the ranger then the
SK.  My half elf bard did start in Freeport, where I was able to hunt
in the local area (E./W. Commons, NRo & Oasis) from levels 1 - 19
(although I did leave the area for a bit in my low to mid teens to go
hunt wisps in Erud's Crossing and do some questing)  Once you make 5th
level, you'll be able to learn your Selo's song, which increases your
foot speed.  This will save your butt many times and and make traveling
much less of a pain.  Also, as a half elf, your faction won't be as
screwed up in most areas as if you were a human or dark elf SK.

All that aside, you should take whichever one you think you'll have the
most fun with, and if you're not sure, create them all and level them
up a bit, and see which one seems like the most fun.  Or, have more
than 1 character :) - my main is a mage, but my bard (2nd highest out
of 8) has come into her own now, and is leaving for Kunark next time I
play her (YAY!!)

See you around (if you're on Lanys),
