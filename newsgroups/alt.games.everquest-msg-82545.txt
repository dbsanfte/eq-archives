Who figured out all these strange combos of things. I mean like
cooking skills, how in hell would anyone ever get the right combos of
some of these concoctions? It doesn't just stop at cooking, as all are
aware of, but all the trade skills have these wonderful, strange
things. Did the EQ team give these things away? Did it come in some
manual? Did someone hack the game code? Now the question that I hope
has a certain answer, are there more combos to be discovered?

What exactly does AC do for you? Does it make you harder to hit?
Absorbe damage? Something else?

Advice on raising skills that lag behind. please. For example: My 1h
blunt is bad, real bad. Now the problem as I see it is, I can't
practice on things that give no exp points as the skill won't go up.
If I practice on things that give exp, I'll die. What can I do? I
should add I'm not real keen on the idea of putting practice points
into these lagging skills other then a couple.
