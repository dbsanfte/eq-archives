Actually you can get to 30 really really fast, but if soloing it
depends on the character. I think after the sk/hybrid changes when I
made a troll sk, I got it to 32 in 4 days of playing, soloing with no
outside help. Of course I know my way around the world and the best
things to do. For example, on that character I immediately had it run
to east freeport from grobb, getting an sow from someone on the way.
It then got a bind in east freeport. Then it was time to turn in bone
chips to xelha, the lady in red at necro/sk/cleric/warrior/rogue evil
guild in sewer. Once faction high enough I turned in fire beetle eyes
which I bought out of murrissa sandwicher, once she was out I got an
sow and ran to EC and back with them (erud lady neutral to all sells
them unlimted in EC) In between I beat on things sometimes but mostly
did those quests, I was 14 pretty fast. 

THen I moved to the overthere and soloed there VERY fast from 14 - 23
when it greened out and the rest of overthere was red. It more or less
seemed like I logged on with my troll sk and leveled the soloing was
so fast. Then I went to lake of ill omen and grouped a bit but mostly
soloed at the goblin caves way up north that no one does hardly (they
all do sarnaks.. even when 100 people are there doing sarnaks, not
very original. ) I found I could run through the tunnel and zone into
warsilks, then zone back in and kill the goblins right by the zone
pulling more in the tunnels as needed while really being pretty safe.

Once you get the hang of it its more like you'd have to work to NOT
have a character to level 30 fast casually playing.


>> So what's the point of this post? To remind players that EQ IS A GAME!

Well yeah.
