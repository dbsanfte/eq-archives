    Except now we have tools that link all their gear into /say whenever
they loot their corpses. Perhaps they view it as negative reinforcement - we
die, you get spammed. The one laugh we got from that was when a mangina

gear, and we saw that he also carries a Sparkle Purse. That's taking the
roleplaying that extra mile!
