  My understanding is that some servers do have more than one GM per server,
but there's only one "Server GM" who is the head honcho... but there are a
few people with GM privledges/abilities.

  But see, this is where confusion sets in.  If we were told exactly what
Guides, Senior Guides and GMs can do, and what requires authorization from
THE Server GM, it would do a few things.

  First, the customer would have a better idea of whether or not their issue
could be resolved, and how long it would take to achieve that resolution, or
at least get some sort of "final word."

  Maybe your best bet would be to use the Contact Your Server GM link with
certain issues that a Guide or normal GM couldn't help you with, and not
waste your time and the time of the CS staff by going through the "elevation
process."

  It also might help players give better descriptions of their problem.  I
strongly believe that Verant should make an effort to better educate players
about proper use of /report... it seems like fewer of 50% of EQ players
understand what it does and how to use it, for example.  Lots of people
don't seem to know that petitions get removed from the que after 3 hours.
These are things that players really need to know if they want to maximize
their chances of getting help from a Guide or GM.

  This is customer service, not some clandestine operation.  Not all the
details of the Guide UI and privledges have to be revealed, but some sort of
write-up on what a person can expect to happen when they /petition on few a
common issues would be nice.

  I personally think they should re-do the tutorial, and perhaps create a
tutorial server... that covers all the stuff that the old tutorial did, but
with updated information (and the updated UI), with a brief education on how
to appropriately contact Verant CS and what information to provide and how,
as well as a bit on player etiquette.
