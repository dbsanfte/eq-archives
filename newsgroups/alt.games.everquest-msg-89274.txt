At Level 24 I completed the TOV quest with my cleric (and we all know
clerics can't solo P);  I believe the bandit you have to kill was way green,
but his guard-buddy was still able to kill me once when I first tried it and
was careless.  At +10 WIS and +10 mana it is hard to justify getting rid of
it for a long time.
I believe that into the mid 20s mana items are more efficient for spell
casting than WIS items, and you may be able to find some deals on +mana
items. As for hunting, I'd posted to a similar topic earlier for a 12th
necro, and yours are about the same.  Both  classes solo very  well [ What
ever happened to your baby Necro, Jazzman? ] , or can join similar groups
hunting Orcs in Crushbone, or camps in EC, WC, and Dervs in NRo.  If it
still drops, the Chain mail from Deathfist Orcs sells to vendors for 20+ pp
from what I've heard...I'm just rarely in EC, WC, or Misty to ask for
confirmation or take over a camp to farm it and confirm for myself =)
