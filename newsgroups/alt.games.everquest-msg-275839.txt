Level cap was removed ... your level 20 Enc can now have 200 skill!

Ability to train has been removed. (This is clearly intentional.) 
Although I'm not sure how you are supposed to get your first point in it 
now.

Rumour has it this will allow them to create a research 'trophy' and 
other interesting items in line with the other research skills.

Its a bit of a burn for htose, like myself, with casters that simply 
hadn't gotten around to training them up and suddenly can't. Not sure 
what I'm going to do with the 300 training points I have available... :(

Given the already ridiculous price of words... its definately going to 
hit new int casters pretty hard. 

On the upside, the swatch patterns should be closely looked at for 
anyone looking to raise skill, as you only need one mob drop for them. 

Additionally, the long maligned practice runes might actually be an 
economical and effective way to get skill ups now. Unlike words, at 
least I know where I can go to reliably farm shark skins, giant toes, 
etc...
