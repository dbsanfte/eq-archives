Nope, still not pathing.  Well, it's "pathing" as in at the very moment you
aggro the mob it's *already* out of chase range and turns and runs off.

Get a good bow and tolan bracer and you can solo a ranger from 45 to 55
without ever getting hit using this behavior, it's that predictable and
works the same way in any Kunark and most Velious outdoor zones (indoor too,
but hella harder to make it useful indoors).
