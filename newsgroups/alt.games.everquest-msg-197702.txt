ALL right, but don't be afraid, my post is perhaps miss subjected.
I would know how to reduce my downtime because of med. Thx for C3 advice.
I'm working well on all my skills, and now in lvl11, numerous of it are
caped.

Actually, with your advices, i'm playing with (sow, C/C3/KEI)

Then,

- I root mob
- DoT it (with IceStrike)
- DD it (Shock Of Ice/FireBolt)
- DD
- DD
- DoT
-and so...

If root brck
- Root mob
- DoT
- DD
...and so...when mob is around 20%HP :
...root breack
- DD
- DD
...mob and me are in melee
- Piercing
- Then PB AE (Finger of Fire)

If root brck and can't be able to reroot before mob and me are in melee then
:
- PB AE (Figer of Fire) to stun mob a little
- Shadow Step
- Run
- Root
- and so and so....

That's advices from my husband. What are thinking about ? is it good step
for wizard lvl 11 (near 12 :-))

One question more : Why often my spells are interrupted ?

My husband is playing a BST 46, not PL, and tell me exactly the same things.
But he forgot to explain me a lot of things and don't know Wizard class.
