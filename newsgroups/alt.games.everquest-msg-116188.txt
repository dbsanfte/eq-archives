There's a monk trainer in Shadow Haven.  He stands just
inside the Library area (or caster guilds) across a stone
bridge not far from the Paludal Caverns zone line.  He
won't train you without faction work, however, so you have
to get behind him, sneak until he's indifferent, then train.
That'll replace most of anything for which you need a guild
except buying shurikens (or other throwing weapons) which
I haven't been able to find in Shadow Haven.  Supposedly
they're sold in Fungus Grove which you should be able to
get to fairly easily if you've worked your feign death skill.
Just make sure to avoid the tentacles of the plants on the
way through Echo Caverns.

The closest portal to where you could likely train would be
Dreadlands (Kunark portal), unless you've done a lot of faction
work and can get to and train in Qeynos  Or you can find Brother
Quinn in South Karana; I *think* he'll train Iksars.  Both Qeynos and
South Karana can be reached from the North Karana (Antonica)
portal.

Just train in Shadow Haven;  it's a LOT easier.
