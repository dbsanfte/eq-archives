Why not get your own domain, and then you can keep a stable email address?
Various registrars will sell you domains for $5-$20/year, including email
forwarding for several email addresses (100 is typical).  You set the
forwarding to point to wherever you receive mail (e.g., your account at your
ISP).  If you ever change providers, you simply change the forwarding.  Your
email address stays the same to the outside world.
