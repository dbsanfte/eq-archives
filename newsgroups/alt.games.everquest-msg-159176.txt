It's a big, expensive heal, but quicker than CHeal.  And it's
nice when that add starts munching on the tank shortly before
you were going to start the CHeal...

It's a reverse damage shield.  Every damage shield loses some
effectiveness when mobs are slowed.  So the question becomes
"Is doing X amount of damage worth Y mana?"  If you're just
grouping with warriors, it probably is worthwhile since their
damage potential is relatively low.
