So, the rabble says one thing, the people who actually study the game
say another, therefore you follow the mob?


Most of the characters I've played have been Taunt classes, and I
can tell you that it is possible to fail a Taunt with a high skill
when a mob is beating on somebody who has done nothing to add hate
other than simply being within the mob's agro range.  I can also
succeed in Taunting a mob off a character who has a huge amount of
hate when I have none.  Neither of these would be possible if Taunt
worked as you say.  Consider also Davian/Dearic's experience as an
MT.  If Taunt worked as you believe how could it be that he was able
to greatly reduce the frequency with which he lost agro by NOT
mashing the button once he had agro.  This which allows him to Taunt
immediately if the mob breaks for another character (or if he sees a
Tash, or a Slow, or some other high agro spell land), which in turn
means that he still has the proximity modifier working in his favor
when he's trying to keep the mob off the casters.

As for "no one can show proof", are you motivated to do the
necessary testing?  The "experts" have found a model that explains
their results accurately, which the "button mash mob"'s model does
not do.  So it doesn't really matter to the "experts" whether their
working hypothesis is correct or not, all that matters is that it
fits the methods that give them the best results, while the model
presumed by the people who get inferior results does not.  The
reason people take an empirical (rather than scientific) approach
to this is that nobody sees significant benefit to doing otherwise,
it'd be a lot of effort for little or no gain.
