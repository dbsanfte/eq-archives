Another click thru screen on log in?  Or do they mean a pop up like the annoying Help
window you get when you first log in a new character?  If so, can this be turned the f*ck
off?  At least the Help screen is once only per character, unless you want to call it up.

How incredibly annoying.  Untwinked characters below tenth can often kill red cons solo,
and certainly should make a habit of doing so while grouped.  If this is once only per
character thats one thing, but if its every time, wow what a bright idea, not.  Twinks
and PL victims are going to be cursing this patch for the entire hour they spend under
10th, but it will be something nice to look forward to when it goes away!

Good thats a pain.  Wonder if bards will get the same benefit!

How about innocent trolls just trying to buy some Fuzzlecutter 5000?

Nice one, course now that we can just POK to Paineel or Everfrost this isn't as big a
deal as it was when my characters were youngsters... but I suppose with the new
class/race armor quests more people would like to stay in their home areas while young
and untwinked.

Mmmm, I wonder if one sells the equivalent of Fuzzlecutter 5000 for food!  A fish rolls
vendor would be quite handy.

Umm, sure, you said that in a -previous- patch.  Who is it -supposed- to be assigning it
to?  It would be a boon if it assigned it to the person being hit, it would suck if it
assigns it to the person casting the DS.  If, that is, "credit" means aggro.  If it means
"for the purposes of KS" then assigning credit to the person casting the spell will
really take the wind out of certain PL styles.

Hmm, assigning aggro to the DS caster would also suck for PL purposes, imagine your young
protoge wading into a pile of mobs, they all aggro to him... and then peel off and attack
the caster instead, because the youth hasn't done anything to anger them but be there,
and the caster is "hitting" them every time they hit the youth!

If though, as we hope, DS is meant to act as aggro on the person being hit, then perhaps
group DS casting is a thing of the past, single target on the designated MA would help
him keep aggro, and when someone else gets it by mistake or takes riposte damage this
won't add to their dilemna.

I'll believe this one when I see it.

I never saw this.  OH, they say "on the PC".  Since my total PvP time probably measures
under 4 hours (and most of that playing "kill the Guildleader" after guild meetings in
the Arena zone) its no wonder I never observed this.  Cast UHOF, then Annul the other guy
and the hammer vanishes?  Heck, I'd just assume he killed the little guy!

I've observed this several times, the PC would go LD and his pet would attack anyone
nearby, or just yesterday I found a necro pet was attacking me for casting Eye of Zomm,
without the controllers' order to do so

New Buff, then?  Well new group buff anyway.  Whats it do?

Heh, I can't tell you how annoying it is to stun a mob, see the stun message, but see it
continue its cast as if nothing happened.  Now thats just a learning exercise of course,
soon enough you learn that a mob can't be stunned... but not having the game lie to you
and say it has been when it hasn't should help a bit on new targets.

Bad news for necros?  Were these protecting from real DoTs?  Or good news... were DoTs
preventing the lich series from working?

I suppose that affects mostly PvP, if Flame Lick was being used as a debuff, on the other
hand, I bet there are a lot of mobs that used those buffs, in which case Flame Lick
should have been a massive boost to kill efficiency, too bad it isn't anymore now that
I've found out about it!

And thus confusing the heck out of thousands of druids that don't read these patch
messages.  Well Joke em if they can't take a f*ck.

See above, only less so.

How about playing a Froglok?  Height on them seems pretty screwed up in first person.

Now that the illusion doesn't affect faction, you mean?  I don't even know what NDT is,
frankly.  If its a DOT like the one that turns mobs into tiny hard to hit jumping
skeletons, this is bad news!

Hmm, maybe if I didn't have sounds turned off in my options this would matter

Mmmm, zone revamps.  New content, of a sort!

Is every patch from now on going to have a section on Plane of Earth?

Sounds scary.   Unlike a zone revamp, this means places still have the old content but
its now going to move in ways you aren't used to... and you'll have to wonder where the
new screwed up pathing places are where the mob warps straight in to kill you, or drops
away under the world when it tries to run are.

SPires?  People still use spires?  I remember when these were the hottest thing going...
like the zepplin.  There's a POK book in the tunnel to Firiona Vie people (well, in FV)
and no 15 minute wait involved!

I'm scared again.  What funky aggro and pathing descisions are these beauties going to be

Oooh, there's a useless key people worked ages to get, what fun!  Fortunately I never
heard of the key, muchless quested for it.  Tell you what, make it FT 1 and fits in charm
slot and I'll start the quest right away.

Umm, I'm pretty sure they did before.  Maybe not, just can't remember noticing them not
doing so.   Hmm, perhaps they had reduced AC effect but since they didn't display it, I
thought that AC was not affected by being below level.  Honestly can't remember even
thinking about this issue before seeing this patch message.

Funny.  Nice quest work you did there too bad you can't wear it.  FRRRooaaak.

A good thing I imagine, although I have no idea what that weapon is.

Thats just a cosmetic change, but its good to see them addressing such things.

Wonder if this sucks... or if the items can't be used by a froglok class, in which case
its just cosmetic and I seem to recall quite a few other items that list a race but no
class that race can be.

Cosmetic, then.

Actual change, or cosmetic?

>
> - Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now "worn" rather than "combat".

Hmm, whats the effect?  This is a big difference for most effects, worn is much better
than combat.  For shoulderpads, hmm, how would combat work anyway, could you equip them
in primary and slap your opponent silly with your armor till it procced?  Assuming not,
did they proc based on primary weapon swings, or did they proc never, or were they really
"worn" but just listed as "combat" and this is a cosmetic change?

>

Wow, 1135 mana item I neeeeeed one!  Nerfed, bah.  Bet they never really were 1135
though, just cosmetic.

This really annoyed me back when I was a solo cleric, root and rot should have been
boosted by EA (IMO) but it wasn't due to our DOTs being such short duration.  It was as
though they deliberately left clerics off the list for that affect.  Now question is, are
there other spells that are now boosted by EAIII that weren't before, that might be more
useful than an undead only DOT (or did they add some undead to the game lately to make
this interesting?)

I haven't considered using a compass since they put the compass thingy into the UI.  Now
if clicking a compass was the equivalent of a successful Sense Heading this would be
useful at low levels...

Whats that?  Would this excite me if I ever made my DE cleric (so as to be able to use
the innoruuk clicky snare neck) ?

Mo Money... that should also mean more exp for those camping these guys no?

Good, more plants please, irritating having lines of spells that affect practically no
mobs at all (although it does make me feel a bit better about cleric anti undead lines)

Umm, in any given zone, I hope you mean?  Cause she pops up in a couple, and it would be

up a higher step epic hand in in OOT!

Good thing my guild hasn't done TT yet then, eh?  And me sitting on a TT zone flag since
about a week after POP release.

Sure wish they'd explain this kind of comment.  Was the servant of Ro in need of Viagra?

Hmm, was this a problem?  I've heard of a few low HP "I shouldn't have died" events, but
I don't recall ever experiencing one even back when I could mod rod a dozen times in a
minute.  I died when a lag in reporting HP loss fooled me, but thats different, looking
back I could see that I did go under my total HP as displayed.

Spelling and grammer good, but what does "fixed a door here and there mean?"  Were there
doors that wouldn't open before that will now?  Is this exciting?

Bored bored bored finish the patch so I can go play!
