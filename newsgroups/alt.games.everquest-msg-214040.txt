It is called supply and demand, if more people want an item, the seller puts
the price up, and people will still pay that price.

Since the server you were on there were less bards, so there wasn`t the
demand for bardic items, hence a lower demand, sellers kept their stock for
longer, and wasn`t selling as quickly, hence a lower price.  On your new
server, demand is higher so they charge a higher price for a more desirable
item.

The other option is, get out and do the quest / hubt the mob that drops etc.
That way it won`t cost you anything, apart from a bit of time.
