Vallon and Tallon Sek (and maybe Griefer Zek, too) have faction hits for pvp
in home cities. They faction hits *used* to be in every zone, but Verant
changed it a year or so back, supposedly to encourage more pvp.

And on Vladesch's 'Enforced role-playing' - if Verant did that, almost
everyone would simply play an evil character (with a few crusader-types out
to smite the evil).

After all, my main on VZ is an erudite (reclusive-verging-on-xenophobic with
a serious superiority complex, according to EQ lore) shadowknight of Cazic
Thule (knight dedicated to spreading the truth of her God by murder, torture
and so on, also according to EQ lore).

So ffa killing would dovetail quite neatly with enforced rp, in my case...
