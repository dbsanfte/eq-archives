warriors seem to vary as much as any other class
depends less upon the race and more upon the player behind
no one gonna be able to tell you which is best for you, gonna have to make
that one yourself

some things i have noticed
trolls get regen, massive kos problems
iksars - same as trolls and cannot wear plate
ogres have size issues
humies night blind
dwarves nice rounded goodies
wood elves weak but rare
halflings and gnomes weak but fun

any race/class combo can be fun IF you make it fun
