I ordered a new WD Caviar 120GB drive (8MB cache) yesterday. I'm going to 
reinstall Windows XP on it. I first upgraded to XP from ME without 
formatting, then I upgraded my motherboard and CPU also without 
formatting. Needless to say the blue screens of death (now called 'stop 
errors') are annoying enough, but EverQuest crashing to the desktop 
constantly is even more annoying. Hopefully a fresh install will clear it 
up. Must I reinstall EverQuest?
