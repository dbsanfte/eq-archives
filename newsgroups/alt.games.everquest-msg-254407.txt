Okay, my crab/tuna are still good for tribute.  Phew.  Though in
checking, I did discover that my tribute is down to under 400.
(About 5 hours worth at my current rate.)  Time to do more fishing!

But now I'm curious about this item:

- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your
inventory screen.

It doesn't seem to be there by default, and I couldn't figure out
how to get it to show up.  I poked around on the inventory screen
and on my mana bar, looked in the options window (including all the
keyboard settings), and even skimmed '/help normal' for new commands.

So, has anyone figured out how to get numeric mana to show up?

As a side note: In checking the keyboard options, I discovered that
they've added a key that's equivalent to the /stopcasting command.
Default is shift-S.  I'm tempted to remap it to 'd', and use some
other key for ducking, since I don't usually duck by reflex but my
fingers are used to using 'd' to stop casting. :-)  I'll probably go
with ctrl-d to duck, analogous to ctrl-s to sit.
