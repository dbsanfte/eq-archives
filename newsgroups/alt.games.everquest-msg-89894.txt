I haven't been grouping with my chanter a lot so dont really know what i
would do.. Never had this happen because the groups i have been in just
fought to death... sometimes a caster has gated when i have said in
succession /g OOM, /g mez broken, but usually people have just stood there
and get whooping. :)
When  i played my ranger, i ran when anyone told me to. As i was sure i was
the first one to go down when stuff went kablooyie :)
I can't recall calling RUN ever when already in fight... Instead, i was
almost always the puller, and i must say, i think i was pretty damn good at
it. So usually people listened to me if i called run. :) Also, mostly only
grouped with guildies, so they knew if i was pulling and calling run, it was
a tremendous overpull (I always got what i was pulling, but in some rare
ocassions because of my crappy old 225mhz/voodoo3 machine i lagged and
aggroed half of the zone because of running straight into a room full of
mobs :). =)
