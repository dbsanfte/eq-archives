Any hybrid who takes offense at that opinion deserves to be booted early
and often.  When you're pulling you get to be LOM most of the time,
that's just the way it is.  And unless you're the only tank you probably
shouldn't be pulling and tanking both.  Unless there is some very good
reason to group with your "very nice Paladin" you should avoid him if
his behavior continues, there is no excuse for him to insist that you
wait on him.  In fact, even tho it's definitely fun to cast a lot during
fights, if I'm LOM most of the time it generally means that we're doing
well and having a blast taking out mobs as fast as we possibly can, and
that's regardless of the role I'm filling for the group/raid.
