Where is the thievery here?  VI has been quite clear on how they, the
rulemakers for the game (game, not RL, game), view this:  anything
deliberately dropped on the grouond belongs to whoever picks it up.
Nothing was stolen, there is no thief.

VI (remember them?) has made it clear that "someone else" is within
their rights to "scoop it up" (I'd say running is optional here, no
need to flee the scene when you've done no wrong).

That's all well and good, but keep in mind that the game has only one
real authority.  You can rant and rave all you like, but it's VI's
world in-game and they define the rules.  By those rules, the OP did
no wrong, and the "victim" fell victim only to her own foolishness.
