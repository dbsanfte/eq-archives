They still do that.  They just have to pull
AoW/Tormax/Vindi/Statue/Idol/etc. to the WL zone to zerg bind rush.  I was
the unfortunate witness of one of these attempts while I was fooling around
on my ogre, I logged in amidst approx. 150 corpses, 30 naked people and an
angry AoW, I promptly went LD from graphical lag and didn't log back in that
character for a few days.
