Oddly, Inner Fire will continue to be your best heal, mana per HP, even past
Healing.

On the other hand, at about level 20, it becomes more efficient to use your
less efficient heal, and sit down and med, instead of standing there
continuously
clicking inner fire the whole time like an imitation bard... because you will
med
back more mana than you would have saved.

If you buy a horse, you will get medition as though sitting while casting the
spell,
and Inner Fire will be the more efficient heal for quite a while longer.

But its annoying, unless of course you've played a bard in the past, in which
case chain casting just one spell will be a breeze.
