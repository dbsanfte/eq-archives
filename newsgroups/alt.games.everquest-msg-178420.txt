Just a quick note to let everyone know a new game trading site launched
yesterday where you can trade your video games with other people.  Go to
www.gottatrade.com and check it out.  It just launched so there aren't too
many games on it yet, but post the games you want to trade and see what
happens!  It's better to trade your old games for new ones than to auction
them off at a fraction of their value.
