My mind is a little fuzzy on this but if I remember correctly, they were
talking about

Not necassarily change, but I read somewhere in a thread on the EQ board,
that with the introduction of Imbued Jewelry, they were thinking of doing
the following.
Adding a 1 time use switch to go agnostic (for those who aren't forced into
religion clerics, pallies etc)
Adding a 1 time Agnostic to Religious switch (for those who didn't
understand that agnostic's can't wear imbued jewelry)

I think it was Absor or one of the other high ups at EQ that was talking
about this awhile ago... I could be and don't doubt that I am wrong but do a
search on there message boards for Jewelry Craft and you will see what i am
talking about.

Ahh just think of the possibilities of  switching religion (An SK of
Quellious? what about a Pally of Bertox?)
Have fun and please don't feed the trolls
