But that's exactly what EQ2 does as well.   The difference is
only they've done a better job of making them balanced.
Let me restate something I said earlier (and I'll make up the
numbers since I haven't researched them...)

Say a cleric gets a 150 HP heal.   A druid doesn't NEED a
150 HP regen to be as effective -- he needs a 120 HP regen
and a damage shield that makes up the difference by killing
the mobs faster.    A shaman doesn't need a 150 HP ward;
he can get by with an 80 HP ward and a slow to make up
the difference.   Balance the power costs and you end up
with a game where a group doesn't NEED any one class;
they all work EFFECTIVELY as well.

The bottom line is they BALANCED the healing ability.
It LOOKS like they're all the same -- but they're not,
they're different.

Does it matter?  Should it?   If it does -- you are going to
create "super" classes IMO.

Ultimately a druid is a priest -- and a cleric is a priest -- and
a shaman is a priest.   They may all work differently and
bring different things to the group, but they'll all be able to
do their primary role -- healing.   They'll accomplish that
by doing things like reducing damage (slows) or increasing
damage (damage shields & DoTs or nukes) or increasing
HPs (buffs) -- or better, by some combination of all of them
so no one class is much better solo.   But it's all the same
thing -- they can keep a group alive.   What else would you
want?
