This is only a problem at certain levels.  10 - 11 and 20 - 21.  At 10 it is
picking a level 8 artisian recepie at random, so it could be from any skill.
At level 20 it is picking an 18 recepie from your second class, not your final
one.  So you could end up as a scribe with an alchemy assignment.   With the
exceptions of those two ranges, it's not an issue.

If you have a bad quest, just wait a bit and ask the wholesaler for a
replacement quest.  If you go up a level during that interval, you're more
likely to get what you want as well.

The reward gets bigger.  I haven't done many of them, (too busy making stuff I
need) but if I remember correctly, a level 13'ish quest gave something like 65
silver.  Which was a tidy sum for me.  Probably not enough to cover costs if
you have to buy every component on the broker, but if you have some friends or
mules that can make them, it's a reasonable payday.
