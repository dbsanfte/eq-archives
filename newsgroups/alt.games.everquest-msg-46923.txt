It can be argued whether playing any MMORPGs at all is a good idea, given 
the amount of time they take from you, and how addictive they can become 
(and EQ is just about the most addictive and time-demanding of them all... 
EQ doesn't really cater to the casual player all too well).

But if you absolutely have to play a MMORPG, no, they don't come any better 
than EQ, for all its faults (and possibly because of them). Technically, 
the Shadows of Luclin expansion should bring it up to at least last year's 
graphical standards, and it has had over two years of gameplay tweaking and 
balancing. It's a *much* better game now than when it came out.
