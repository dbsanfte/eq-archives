In BlackBurrow one fine afternoon, playing guard... (playing GUARD, not
GOD).

Soloing a 15 strong "train," with a few people about dying, and some
helping.  We get that one down to about 7 gnolls, and another train shows
up, (reinforcements from some other lowbie's pull gone bad).  After it
arrives, we're back up to 20-25 mobs.

A minute later, a shout "Gnoll Commander Train to entrance, sorry!"

/me shouts "To whoever is bringing the commander: There are already TWO
trains at the entrance!  Stand and die where you are!"
