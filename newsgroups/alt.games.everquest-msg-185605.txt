This is about the reasoning I had.  I have an uncle dying slowly and 
painfully of cancer.  My grandmother died of cancer.  An aunt had to 
have several operations to get rid of a brain tumor.  Another uncle died 
of cancer.  My co-worker has a dad and friend dying of cancer.  So yeah, 
it makes me wince to see someone name their character that.
