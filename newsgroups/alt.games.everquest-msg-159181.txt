I remember when I was a wee, little one that whenever someone was
auctioning something good, like and FBSS, they would often not take
plat for it.  If you asked them how much it cost, they would say "What
do you have to trade?"  That is, they might trade the FBSS for a
Yakesha or some other piece of equipment.  But now that (almost) never
goes on.  Everything can be bought for plat.  It may cost you 10's or
100's of thousands in plat, but you can use plat to get it.  Does
anyone know why this change came about?  I had little money and few
items worth trading so I never really did any trade-only deals.   I
just remember that they gradually faded away.
