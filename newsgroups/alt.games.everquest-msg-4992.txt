Upon killing Dunedigger in North Ro, I picked up an armidilo hide (or skin
perhaps) off his corpse.  Just wondering if anyone has any real idea what
it's for.  In checking around so far, I've seen everything from "destroy it,
worthless" to "1kpp to the right person".  Hm ... quite the range there ....
