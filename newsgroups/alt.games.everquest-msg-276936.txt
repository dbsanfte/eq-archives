Just thought some of you EQ players might find this amusing.
From the WOW boards:

" During yesterday's maintenance, upgrades were made to both the in-game 
client and to the hardware infrastructure. These changes caused extended 
downtime for some players.

In addition to providing a one-day time extension for players whose realms 
underwent extended maintenance, characters on all realms will be receiving a 
full rest state bonus. In order to apply this rest state bonus to all 
players, we will need to bring all realms down for approximately three 
hours, beginning at 3:00 AM PST, Thursday March 31 "

So our "compensation" for server downtime, is to have more downtime.
