Different servers indeed.   You'll have to imagine how odd that seems to me.
You do entire planes on an informal or FFA system, yet take turns on VS.

And the very idea of VS surviving for 24 hours is damn near inconcievable to
me.  On E'ci, his expected lifespan is less than 1 hour (not counting extra
survival time due to raids needing a 2'nd or 3'rd attempt.).  If a druid is
camping the room for VSR then thier guild will most likely end up doing it, in
the unlikely event that VSR is uncamped,(happens occasionally now that a lot
of druids are finishing up) the guild of the first enterprising tracker in KC
will most likely get him.
