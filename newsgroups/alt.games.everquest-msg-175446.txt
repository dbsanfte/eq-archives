I applaud your desire to more round-out your character by increasing skills
in weapons!  For learning skills as fast as possible, you need a few things:
Sustained time beating on a xp-giving mob.
A fast, but low damage weapon (so you don't kill the mob too quickly). A
shovel (4/27) is a good choice.
As high a "learning attribute" as you can get (for Shaman it should be WIS).
Getting a haste buff (item or spell) will increase your swings, giving more
chances to get a skillup.

Many folk will /duel a Mage of similar level, and beat on his/her pet (at
lest Blue To You). You must stop before you or the pet dies, and the Mage
must call the pet off. Then you two rest, heal, and repeat.
Another tactic is to sidle up next to an XP group, and ask if you can
practice on the mobs they are pulling. You won't get any XP this way, but it
is relatively safe, and I'm sure the group wouldn't mind the buffs you could
offer them.
 Thees two tactics offer a lot of time on BTY mobs, so rather than two hours
in an XP group where you'd be medding., buffing, switching to better weapon,
CR'ing, you can spend a maximum amount of time swinging that Louisville
Slugger!

Hope this helps!
