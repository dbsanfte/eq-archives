Snip

Thus endeth your part of the contract, which was porting him to NK.
I'd have continued on my way. For future reference though, I always
invis and sow any char likely to be kos such as evil types before
porting to places like NK/WC/Surefall/EK. The rest just have beta
neutral vendors. I also ignore their begging unless they offer
something for the port and such offers are always up front. If I sow,
camo and port them because they paid me 25 plat then I fulfilled my
obligation. Anything that happens to them after all is their fault or
act of god stuff.
