Perhaps more. Average rated lifespan for most drives is in the region
of 50000 hours, which, if it's running 8 hours per day, equates to 17
years... Some SCSI drives have up to 100000 hours estimated life!

(although IBM's "consumer" drives have an estimated 20000 hour
lifespan, or just over two years if run 24/7, or 7 years if run 8
hours/day... which means I should start thinking about replacing my
crap IBM drive about now...)

IME the computer _lives_ that long, but it's thoroughly outdated and
in need of replacement after three.... And if you're a gamer you
probably want a 2 year cycle, as gaming is about the most demaning
thing you can do with a computer.
