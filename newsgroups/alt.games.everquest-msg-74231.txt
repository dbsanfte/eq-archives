believe this will be very helpful for all people using SOL who fit in the
category ( over 128 meg).  this comes from a note from someone who fills us
in about patching about patch on DEC 8, 2001.  can look up in back news on
http://eq.castersrealm.com if you wanna track down what and who exactly said
this, brought it up.

also in this is from http://www.aumha.org/a/memmgmtz.htm#conserve

who says he got 250 K hits from people who found this info.

I still don't have my new comp, so its water under the bridge, but nice to
have in prep for it.

glad you posted this today, being that I was too lazy to bother.  been
typing stuff on this board for too long.  ROFL
