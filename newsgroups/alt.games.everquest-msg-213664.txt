Necromancer/any race

Gnomes can tinker as a racial skill
Iksar have natural regen which works wonders with the necro line of
hit point to mana conversion spells
Erudites have the highest starting Intelligence (if you dump all their
start points into Int)
Humans are the most challenging
Dark Elves are the most common :)

Many other classes can solo better at certain level ranges, but no
other class is as powerful from level 1-65
