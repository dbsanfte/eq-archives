I made apprentice 3 scrolls for my early skill still on the Isle of
Refuge, so its not hard. All I used were foraged roots, mined
lead, canine spit, etc. Making it was time consuming, but free. I didnt
sell them, of course, I used them myself, but I did almost all my
starting combat skills; certainly all the ones I used soloing, and
sneak and pathfinding as well.
