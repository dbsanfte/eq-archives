Not at all.  See, an item may be mediocre for someone who is level 55, 
and yet fantastic for someone who is level 45, and pure crap for someone 
who is level 65.  You can (and generally do) make most of your money 
selling items you wouldn't wear to people who can't loot anything that 
good for themselves.  And the stuff you wear is similarly being looted 
by people who are more powerful than you and looting stuff thats no good 
to them... but sellable.

AND rare does not mean great, either; take for example the Glowing Black 
Stone, once an item beyond compare, now trash many people wouldn't 
bother to loot if it was no drop.  Something like that can be rare 
enough that you don't ever see it in the bazaar, yet still not be an 
upgrade to anyone in your group if it should drop; see it in the bazaar 
later that evening, well, there's an old song "things that make you say 
hmmm"

I think most people are communists, actually, not that thats a bad 
thing.  Despite the vehemant hatred we managed to churn up about the 
idea during the cold war, I can't think of anything wrong with the idea 
in theory, only that its impractical on a large scale as long as humans 
continue to be humans.

I didn't say idiots, either, I said ignorant.  If you haven't carefully 
thought it out, NBG looks like a positive, everyone happy system that 
all should go with unless they are greed riddled bastards.  The same 
could clearly be said of communism.  Most people don't really think 
closely about every aspect of their lives, the more so in a game 
environment.  Doesn't take an idiot to buy into NBG (although I can also 
see where it wouldn't hurt)

And you don't Have to be a liar to be a person who benefits from NBG. 
If you haven't applied yourself to getting loot, NBG works to your 
advantage.  If you have applied yourself to the extent that you know 
where items drop that will benefit you, and make a point of going there, 
NBG works to your advantage.   Yes, Liars (who say something is an 
upgrade when it is not) -also- benefit... but the category is larger 
than just that.

A), or something new, a massive twink. Because otherwise, everyone needs 
money, and loot sells, so it can be turned into money.  This is the 
whole basis of the "loot stuff, sell it, repeat many times, buy better 
loot than you will ever pick up off a body at your level" plan

Apparantly you are an A type personality!

I don't think LDoN is the best place to discuss this sort of thing. 
Loot in LDoN seems to be very randomly distributed, for the most part 
you can't predict what will drop where, so you can't deliberately do a 
single mission again and again knowing that paladin item X drops there.

Look instead at Sebilis or Karnors or something like that, where you 
-can- go make a good shot at getting specific items.  Now, if you do the 
research and discover that item X drops off the frogloc toilet bowl 
cleaner in Seb, do you deliberately go there with groups, given that you 
could use that item?  If you look at the loot table for the Frogloc 
Window Washer and there's nothign there for you, do you avoid that 
particular camp?

I didn't say I was, or did.  I really don't care all that much.  I 
generally do NBG.  And I generally believe people who say they need an 
item.  In practice, it works ok, after all, and its only a game.  But 
all I'm saying is, if you think about it, its certainly an opportunity 
for the selfish to take advantage of those who wish to play fair.

I've used that theory numerous times as well, the "sure you can have 
that 2k item, well worth it to find out I never want to group with you 
again" plan can work wonders.

Niceness is often its own reward, just as selfishness is often its own 
punishment.

I go along with NBG any time anyone proposes it, and it still makes me 
feel a bit noble when someone takes an item I could have rolled on... 
but that doesn't mean its not still a ripoff some of the time.

Splendid
