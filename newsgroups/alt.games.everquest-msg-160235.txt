You sir, have been found guilty of "Having a Sense of Humor".  As
treatment for this pernicious malady your eyelids will be surgically
removed and you will be forced to watch each and every episode of
"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea".  A written test on the content of
each episode will be administered at the conclusion of the entire
viewing period, a score of less than 99% accuracy on the test shall
result in the repetition of the entire treatment program.

Have a Nice Day!  :)
