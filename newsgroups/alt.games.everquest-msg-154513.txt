What about the fact that right now lower level mobs don't hurt as much as
higher level mobs even though my armor hasn't changed.  Perhaps they can do
less damage but shouldn't they still hit me as often for "1 pont" of damage.
In other words.  Shouldn't there be a scale for the level range of the
monster also in regards to your ac.  We are talking about damage being taken
correct?
