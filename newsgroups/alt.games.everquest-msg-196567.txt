There is no such thing as an agnostic necro. Necros are clerics to 
death. Mucking with life after death is a very religious issue.

My dark elf necro became beloved of NFP by killing orcs in east commons, 
and doing the Jenam and Rebby quests. Do be wary even after that- the 
unpleasant gnome is annoying. The peasant washerwoman and the monks 
still will not like you. The Arcane Scientists (magic users) will hate 
you. The church will still want your head on a stick. And of course, the 
bards are firmly convinced you think they can't sing.

I killed gargoyles in Ocean of Tears for a while, and now the bards will 
give me concerts. The rest of them still don't like me much.

As for the OP, walk back to Neriak for the bank, or use a POK book, 
while you work on faction.
