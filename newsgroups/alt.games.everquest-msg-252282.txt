Ahh, so you postulate that the game company *told* the scammer to take the
money back?

Same page...  we're not even in the same ballpark.

Ad in the newspaper:

Imaginary Car, $3,000.00

You respond.  You give me $3,000.00.  I give you possession of the imaginary
car.

Try and go to court and get your money back.

Or just steal it back.  =P
