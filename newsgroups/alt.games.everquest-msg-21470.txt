Find out what classes the other folks in your group are, then just fill in
the gaps.  Druids make EXCELLENT putty. :)

If there's no cleric in the group there's a good chance you'll be either
primary or secondary healer...talk to the other non-cleric healer in the
group and decide who's primary, who's secondary.

After that, your skin buff may be the best HP buff in the group, so keep
that in mind.
If there's another snarer in the group (ranger and druids only...no other
class has a "snare" type spell quite as nice), just decide with them who's
the primary snarer. - Then keep your eye out for the "ensnared" message -.
If the critter is half down and still not snared, go ahead & spend the 35
mana and do it yourself (btw, if you haven't upgraded to ensnare yet, do
that now...it costs more but casts faster and lasts MUCH longer).  No one
likes runners, and after 51 levels I STILL forget to snare on occasion (I
hate that).

If healing and snaring is covered, druids have the 2nd best damage shields,
and tanks tend to really like 'em.  If you have a magician of the same
circle of spells in your group, let them DS.

Then, after all this, if nothing else you get to be nuker.  Keep note how
long it takes to kill stuff.  Druids LOVE to DOT things, but if they die in
less than a minute that's wasted mana.

Bottom line is this:  You are an asset to any group at your level.  Think
"putty."  Fill in the gaps.  It's amazing that Verant made druids both very
soloable and very group-friendly.
