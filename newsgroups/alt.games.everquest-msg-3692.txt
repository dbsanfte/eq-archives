In the next 15 levels (next 37 really) you get two skills, Riposte at
25 (yay!) and Disarm at 35. Go put a practice pooint in Riposte as
soon as you can, it only goes up with use (you being whacked), though
it will go up quickly. I only ever put one point in, and it maxed at
27.  It is an excellent skill, basically you block an attack and get a
free shot in on top. If you have mob misses turned off, you might not
notice it. I turned them on and was surprised by how often the skill
really works.

The only magic you will ever get is in items. For instance I got a
Pegasus Cloak around your level and now I float all the time. SoW
potions are very nice, not cheap at 10 pp per drink, but I do make
enough coin to pay for my habit.

You are at just the right level to start questing for Crafted Armour,
you should try and get every piece except the Pauldruns. Start with
Gauntlets and Bracers, check
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/qsearch.html?zone=44 for details on the
various Crafted Quests. Since you do have a regular group, ask them to
research their own armour quests, and spend a couple Saturdays getting
quest pieces for each of you.

I'll list my armour, it should give you some ideas for improvements. I
have a pretty good set for my level, 35, with 747 being my unbuffed
AC.

Ears: 2*Orc Fang - 3 AC, 3 str, 15 hps.    Cougar Claw are better, but
a little less common and pricier.
Neck: Fine Plate Collar - 8 AC.
Face: Grotesque Mask - 3 AC, 7 dex, -9 cha.  This sucks, but I made a
Barbarian Warrior with 70 dex.
Head: Crafted Helm - 14 AC, 5 wis, 5 int, 2 vs. magic.
Fingers: 2*Jagged Bands - 5 AC, 3 str.
Wrists: 2*Crafted Bracers - 10 AC, 2 dex, 2 int.
Arms: Crafted Vambraces - 12 AC, 1 str, 2 vs. poison, 2vs. disease.
Hands: Crafted Gauntlets - 12 AC, 5 str
Shoulder: Tattered Mantle - 12 Ac, 10 vs. disease, 20 hps.   This is
the only place I am not wearing Crafted, and this has the same AC. 3
rune of Dwarves is just nasty to get. I have two though :).
Back: Splinted Bronze Cloak - 8 AC.   My only remaining bronze, a bit
of an embarrassment, but at least it isn't visible.
Belt: Straw Spun Belt - 10 AC.
Legs: Crafted Greaves - 14 AC, 1 str, 2vs. fire 2vs. cold.
Feet: Crafted Boots - 12 AC 5 agi.

Since the list is up, anyone want to give me some suggestions on
improvements? Other than the FBSS, I know I need that :P

For weapons, I use Mithril Staff (2hb, 28 45, 800 pp), Fleshripper
(2hs, 20 42, no drop), Silvery Two Handed Axe (2hs, 21 48, 430 pp),
Dragoon Dirk (pierce, 6 23, 50 pp), Wraithbone Hammer (1hb, 8 26, 750
pp), and the Kunzar Ku'juch (1hs, 8, 22, 4600 pp)

I just carry the Silvery Two Handed Axe because it gives Infravision,
the Dragoon Dirk is usually in my ranged slot for the 2 dex and 3 vs.
magic. I wouldn't recommend the fleshripper, it procs an area affect
dd, and isn't a great dam/delay anyway. I just wield it and the dirk
because I need something keep the skill up.

Suden, 35 warrior
