I'm guessing that this means if you do a bazaar search for potions
usable at your level, you'll no longer see potions where the *potion*
claimed it was usable at your level but you couldn't actually use it
because the spell effect of the potion was above your level.

Even after reading Alla's page about Raging Servant, I have no idea
what the "one point of damage" is for.  Was the problem that you
couldn't sic these things on a mezzed target?  (I'm not especially
familiar with Gift of Mana, either, frankly.)

Yup.  I noticed recently that they seem to have fixed a spelling error
in the message when I get left behind by a succor spell.  Either that
or it depends on which form of succor spell is used.  (Last night I tried
to get the older spell to fail again so I can check, but of *course* now
that I *want* to fail I've had over 150 succors without a failure...)

The eqtraders page on the Jewelry trophies is sufficiently out of date
to answer this. :-)  Two of the items listed there for the Master trophy
are:
	Palladium Lapis Lazuli Earring
	Palladium Diamond Veil
The allakhazam page for the trophy task shows different items for those
two steps:
	Velium Practice Earring
	Silver Conduit Cylinder

I don't follow jewelcraft closely, but I saw some posts saying the two
palladium items can no longer be made, so I assume they got changed to
the new items at that time.  And nobody thought about the implications
to the Progression server until you guys unlocked PoR. :-)
