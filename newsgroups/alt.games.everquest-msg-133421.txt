You guess.  It's probably a lot more accurate to say that:  for the mobs
somebody claims to have tested (Katta guards as i recall) the "soft cap"
is around 1300ac if you are the same class and level (60 warrior) as the
testing character.  Don't forget that the displayed ac "stat" is a value
computed independently of the mechanics that resolve combat (displaying
  separate values for attack avoidance and damage mitigation was dropped
sometime in beta, or so i've been told).  Along with that consider the
often remarked upon S-curve you get when you graph the effectiveness of
various AC values versus particular mobs.  The "soft-cap" for "a bat" is
much lower than the cap for "a cyclops" which in turn is lower than that
for the AoW.

So, a number of folks who play the high level game have claimed that
displayed AC above a certain value (1200 to 1350, depending on who you
listen to) seems to have little benefit.  If you're not fighting at
that extreme level you might find a lower value to be more correct.
And if you want a definitive answer, go to work for Verant and study
the program code.
