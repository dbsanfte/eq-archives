:) Semantics I guess...reading what you wrote sounds to me like what I
just said, so, heh, no disagreeing here.  (Saying "at the same place" is
such a vague phrase that I shouldn't have used it.)

As long as you can group with friends without feeling you'd be better off
alone, and as long as you can solo without feeling bitter that the game
forces you to be around people you don't like (assuming your friends
aren't online) to get bearable exp...I'm happy.
