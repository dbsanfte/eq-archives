It is not PvP it is RvR. You choose a realm from 3. You cannot
communicate in any way with the enemy realms. THey will never be
friends or friendly, cannot heal you etc, If you see them, they are
the enemy, run or fight. If you die in RvR you lose nothing. You
return to your last bindpoint with no item or exp or con loss. It is a
glorified game of team fortress classic at the high end with added
things like sieges thrown in.
