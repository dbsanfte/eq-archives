I don't camp really, but the best stroke of luck I've had was being
bored, killing the oracle in OOT, then killing the AC PH 4 times and
having the AC spawn and one of my twinks wearing jboots (via
multiquesting myself and dropping items, and twink running from
overthere unassisted) two hours later. All that while not even
planning to camp the area at all but just running around.

Second best stroke of luck I hardly count since it was REALLY lucky,
TOO lucky actually. Logged out on sisters isle near AC. Must have got
on right when server came up cause swam over and see on track AC UP. I
get there, pause, no players in area even. Kill it and get ring and
happy dance. 2 casters show up then as I run around the island jumping
and celebrating. "This Ac spawn is camped, sorry = / " one of them
says. I did not have the heart to tell them they should have been 5
minutes earlier.. ahahah. Less than 2 hours later and right before the
server went down my other twink, a troll sk, got jboots also having to
run from overthere unassisted (by now I'm kinda getting to be an
expert at that ; ) )

Its insanely rare now and always camped. That is why it sells for like
8 - 10 k on many servers. I gave up on it and got that haste belt from
kedge which I actually think is really better for the value, I traded
a pair of rygorr pants for it and that blackened crystal robe I'd been
trying to sell for 4 days, so basically it was FREE. My troll sk wears
it and it is like 16 percent haste and 4 ac VS the Fbss ZERO ac and 19
- 20 percent haste (reports vary)

An infantile child kind of infantile child ;)  Seriously, a guild does
not become uber overnight if ever. Every guild can't be uber. You
can't be a guild and say "We are going to be Fires of Heaven", it
doesn't work that way. Even if the one or two or three people who
started Fires of Heaven started a new guild on a new server and said
"we are going to be Fires of Heaven, just like on our old server" it
would simply not work. An uber guild more or less happens by chance
and depends on things like the leader and the people in it. Now if the
ENTIRE Fires of Heaven guild moved to a new starting server, or to
DAOC or something yeah, they'd no doubt be uber there too.
The thing is though I really doubt if they'd want to do all that
again, its really a lot of work and a lot of equipment and levels to
be able to take the most uber mobs.

A great guild is not just made, it is built. It is built with sweat
and blood and understanding that sometimes you won't have the people
to do something when you want to and if you don't the thing is to not
sweat it and to GET the people so you do and think that tomorrow is
another day. Or eventually you could all get real lives and 40 hour a
week jobs and decide that playing a video game is not really as
important ;) and just decide to have a mediocre friendly guild who
does things sometimes.

Frankly I'd totally write off the FBSS as something to camp If I were
you, it is probably one of the largest frustrations I've heard of in
the game. You are setting yourself up to fail more or less and as you
say spend 29 hours there and get JACK CRAP. 
Even in the game Everquest you could make better use of your time for
29 hours.
