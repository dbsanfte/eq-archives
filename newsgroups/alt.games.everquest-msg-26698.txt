I think it's great, much more fun that the other servers I've been on.
I'm a high elf on the good team where we are very underpowered
compared with the other teams, but I'm in a really good guild with
lots of other good players and we have lots of fun despite the fact
there only a few zones we can go to with any safety.

There are a whole lot of idiots on the server but also a lot of good
people. If you join a guild that's any good you can ignore most of
the idiots most of the time.

Try a character on each team for 2 or 3 levels to get a feel for each
team and see what you like. For example if you play an evil Iksar
you might as well be on a blue server much of the time. If you play
a good high elf, you have to be on guard all the time (But I rarely
actually get attacked, just have to be very careful)
