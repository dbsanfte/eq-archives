Actually, the mana song part is not true for a 55+ bard.  The level 55
Catana of Replenishment does 12mana/tick and 11hp/tick regen
(27hp/tick with lute) and it lasts for 3 ticks, or as long as the
little blue brain icon is visable.  The orignal level 32 manasong,
Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity, is pulsed based, has no icon, and gives
7mana every time it pulses (but no more than once per tick).  There is
also the level 34 Catana of Soothing which gives 5mana/tick and
9hp/tick regen, but the bard must be a lute to use.  The level 32
stacks with either of the other two, but they cannot stack with each
other.  It is possible to keep 3 mezzed and keep manasong on pretty
much all the time, but not something I could imagine doing if an
enchanter were available......  However, if there is only a single
add, a bard could charm the add and use manasong to help time the
re-charm.  
(OK, total sidebar here.  I've been in these situations, and I've
always just broken out the flute and gone strictly crowd-control.  I'm
not even sure that using an instrument helps mezz, but I'm not about
to take that chance.  I guess I should have swapped lute and flute as
I switched between mezz and Catana, to give the cleric more overall
mana.  Nah, it's tough enough switching targets on three mobs without
having to make sure you're not poking them with the lute.  Anyway, I
would normally twist in a battle buff over manasong if I could,
figuring that the faster the tanks kill the mob, the sooner I can stop
this insane twisting.)
Anyway, yeah, bard slows aren't as good as shaman or enchanter slows,
and our hastes aren't as good either, but if you're trying to be most
effecient the enchanter probably isn't going to have enough mana to
mezz the adds, slow the mobs, and haste the tanks all at the same
time.  The bard is going to do some of that, unless you have a shaman
in the group too, and at that point the bard might as well go solo.
It's more fun that putting on manasong, and getting outdamaged by the
shaman's pet.

As far as I can tell, 4 is the limit that you can keep mezzed.  It
takes about 3 seconds to get the song to pulse, and it lasts about 12
seconds.  If you've got 'em spread out just right and switch targets
quickly, you can just about keep up with it.  The really annoying
thing is that both of our mezzes move the mobs, but in different
directions.  That's why you'll often see a bard spin around to face
away from a mob that is close to him, better mez pushes the mob in the
opposite direction that you're facing.

Yeah, I'm noticing that on semi-big critters, an SK seems to be better
at keeping the critter from hitting anyone else.  I'm also starting to
really be impressed by the way PALs can offtank unmezzable mobs.  They
don't do much damage, but they keep it busy and don't yell for heals
unless another comes along  Just think of them as shiny, single use
enchanters.
