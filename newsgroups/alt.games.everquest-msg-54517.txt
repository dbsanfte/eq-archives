Please read what Sang posted. He damn well PROVED it was extremely
useful. Maybe not in that post, but elsewhere in the thread for sure.

IMO, there isn't a single contributor to this group more knowledgeable
about the mechanics of EQ than Sang. When he says it's so, it IS so.
If you don't believe him, do the math yourself. Unless your belt
is 150AC, you WILL benefit from a FBSS, and even then, you'll still
generate more aggro with a haste item, making it more desirable.

(Of course, in that hypothetical case, I'd rather get a Hangman's
Noose or some haste gauntlets, but since there is no belt giving
that much AC, the point is moot...)

Rune, who feels like he's sucking up to Sang or something today...
