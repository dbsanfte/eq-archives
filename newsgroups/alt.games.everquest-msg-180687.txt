No mention of things like...graphics...innovation...clean/solid
interface...system performance...Are these things not as important?

And what about cheats?  Is this as much of an issue as say FPS or do
you care?  and if you do, would you be willing to submit to a software
scan of your system to guarantee you are playing on a level field?  
Or is this better left to the admin to monitor and players to call
others on?
