Two more years before we get to make that decision.  This election, aside
from local and state issues, is to decide which party gets to control the
House of Representatives, and/or the Senate.  Preferably, the Republicans
will not gain control of both, as then they will actually be able to pass
some legislation that Bush will sign.  I am always happiest when the
Presidency and at least one of the houses are controlled by different
parties, doesn't much matter which is which.
