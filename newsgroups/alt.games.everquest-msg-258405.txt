Heh, once I'm cited and know I'm wrong, I quite enjoy arguing with police 
officers.  Generally not about anything related to the offense in 
question, but I'm not often going to get other chances to ask their 
opinions about things, in the general course of things.  As long as I 
don't piss 'em off too bad, what the heck. :) Gives me a chance to get all 
my little nagging questions about police procedures and the law off my 
chest.  And of course, I'm generally pretty agreeable about it.  If I get 
the sense they think I'm trying to argue my way out of the ticket, I back 
down pretty fast and apologise.
