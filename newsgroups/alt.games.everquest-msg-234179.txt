Almost. Although I have meleed most of my career (particularly from 1-34,
and then as primarily a soloer in the 30's and 40's, at 65 I rarely fight
anymore (sigh). I can't remember the last time I pulled out my spear, I
usually I have my Tome of Reflection or my Ceramic Hammer of Innovation as
my primary and generally regard myself as about a 99% caster. On the rare
occasion where I do get to fight, I get in some respectable licks with my
spear, but it's really nothing to write home about and I'm really acting as
a mana-less DoT.

Your pet is a god-send and will really change your life. It's often said
that he's not the tank that a Mage or Necro pet is, but he is the following:

1) A long-term, re-usable DoT of his own;
2) A good, temporary diversion during the early pull allowing you to set up
your DoTs; and
3) A life-saver for those times when you just need to bolt out of there.

Btw, I think every Shaman needs to have a thorough soloing career at some
point in their lifetime in order to build up Defense and Dodge. Your role as
a Shaman is going to demand that you step right into the line of fire often,
root-parking via aggressive slows on unengaged adds, suicide-slowing, etc.,
and you're going to need to be able to take some hits. Gear of course is
most influential here, but the better and longer  you can withstand hits,
the more effective you'll be in your role. Even as a 99% caster now in my
career, I feel very comfortable standing toe-to-toe with most of the
day-to-day mobs that face my groups at least long enough to be able to get
off a Root or a resisted Slow. I'm not sure that would have happened if I
hadn't paid my dues soloing and building up my fighting skills all the way
up. Maybe.

I don't know about other Shamans, but I haven't found my nukes to be that
useful in most group (and certainly raiding) situations. I keep a nuke
loaded as part of my Travel gemset for disposing of pests, and occasionally
if I'm expecting runners. But in most group situations I hardly use it. In
planar situations or high difficulty ldons, DoTs like Blood of Saryn and
Bane of the Nife can run their course fully (and if dps is low, sometimes
more than once), and that's 550-ish a tick compared to 925, your highest
level nuke. We won a level 65 high diff ldon last night with only 5 players
and I was double-dotting the entire way and never once used a nuke. Perhaps
this is a playstyle issue, or perhaps I'm just missing something that
someone else can point out here, but that's my experience. Of course, in
most normal-diff ldon runs, there's no time to mess with DoTs, mobs drop
like flies and even Slows can be of questionable utility in some people's
minds. In those situations a nuke may give better value but in those
situations it will hardly make a difference. As always, tactics need to
reflect the situation.
