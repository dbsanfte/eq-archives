I've played both pretty hard, but not through their endgames. CoH through 
level 32 (of 40 at the time) and a couple of characters into the 20's.  EQ2 
through level 23 Mystic/24 Alchemist (of 50/50), and a couple of characters 
into their 20's.

My take is that both games are very fun and enjoyable, but EQ2 will require 
much more commitment of both time and hardware and pay off far greater as a 
result. EQ2 is deep and rich with content that will keep you busy for 
months. I think Rumbledor's CoH assessment below is very good and I agree 
with everything he's said about it.

I'm going with EQ2 and hoping they can pull together a smooth launch. It 
will be iffy, however, given all the changes that have been introduced so 
late in the beta. But if they can pull it off and get things working 
smoothly, it's going to be the MMOG of choice for me for some time.
