You did go to every zone in the area and do /corpse, right?  That'll 
tell you if there's a corpse in the zone.  If you weren't logged in on 
that account during those 4 days the corpse might be around somewhere. 
If you were on in the meantime the corpse will likely be gone and you 
have a sad situation.  Happened to a guildmate of mine (he made it to 
the zone ahead of a train but went LD while zoning and didn't realize 
the server declared him dead) and the whole guild chipped in to get him 
equipped to the point where he could at least play.
