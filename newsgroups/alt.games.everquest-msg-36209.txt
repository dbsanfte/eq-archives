Some skills, like Alteration, will indeed raise five points during a
normal level's hunting, but most others won't, and I don't want them to
lag behind the others, so I'm really anal about topping up all my skills
every time I gain a level, lest I have to scramble and catch up twenty
points or more later on if I have been lax.
