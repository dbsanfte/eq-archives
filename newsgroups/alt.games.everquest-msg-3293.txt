Kiting is basically where you kill a Mob, hopefully without ever getting
hit, by following a process similar to this:

Step 1. SoW Yourself, or use some other comparable speed-enhancing
spell/song

Step 2. Root the Mob you are intending to Kill

Step 3. Cast a DoT spell on said Mob and run far enough away that you
can re-root the Mob when the spell breaks without getting interrupted.

Step 4. Sit down and Med, and watch for the message indicating that
either the DoT has worn off or the Root has broken, and repeat until the
Mob is dead.
