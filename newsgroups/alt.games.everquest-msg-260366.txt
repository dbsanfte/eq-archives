Granted, I did spend a bit longer getting around to it than most
(waited till jan 2003) but I did Exe, at 60, with a group of average
equipped people. I got through on my fourth or so try, and as for
contributing to the group, we were two people alive at the end: I was
tanking while the cleric nuked the last sliver of the boss :)
(There was that little thing about banishing summoned mobs, of course)
I was in BoT, flagged style, by 62, as a druid in average gear.
