I'm primarily interested in the opinions of folks in their 40s or 50s who
group regularly.

My guild went to Chardok tonight.  One person fell off the bridge and we
decided that we might as well jump down and fight our way back through the
tunnel to zone out.

A monk pulled a couple critters prematurely (we had JUST rezzed a guy and
many of us were LOM) and all of a sudden instead of having just 2 we had 6
(NO idea where they came from).

We had 3 enchanters (one per group), 4 clerics (one per group+1) and 3 monks
(one per group) among various other classes, totaling 18 people.  My
enchanter is 52, and primary mezzer, also a 48, and a 45.  Clerics were 57,
55, 53 and 42.  Oh, and a 58 bard that ended up having to start mezzing as
the enchanters either died or ran out of mana.

Almost immediately we lost our druid/evac'er.  Next down (about a minute
later, it was a slow death) our cleric went down.  Oh yeah, and so did ONE
of the critters.  Our tanks were good, for the most part they were assisting
all the time, there were just so many critters there to keep mezzed on 20%
mana or less so the tanks had to do ALL the damage.

To me this seems like a classic evac situation.  We weren't far in Chardok
and the other 2 groups could have evac'd to Skyfire with a short jog back to
rez the poor unfortunates in my group who didn't have gate up because we had
a druid.

So, first, do you agree that it was a good idea to evac?
REGARDLESS of your answer to the first, what class traditionally calls evac?
