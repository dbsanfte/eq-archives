I should add that I never did actually fight them myself, so I can't 
offer a specific suggestion on anywhere that you can fight them on dry 
land.  I was lucky enough to have had the forethought to smith two spools 
I needed back when that was possible, and I knew that I would be needing 
them eventually to complete the shawl, so I bypassed farming any of the 
items needed for that part.
