I would suggest you're being absurd, based on WoW stress test
experience when there really was that much competition or more. Still
didn't have any trouble getting it done. Might have had to wait a few
minutes, or come back in an hour. But that was at its absolute worst
crowding, far beyond the standard situation any mmorpg in release
would ever need to worry about.
