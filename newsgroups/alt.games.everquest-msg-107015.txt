That's where I took my chanter at that level.  Now with the expansions 
out there are better places to be, but I still spend time in Rathe 
Mountains.

It's good to be in a group and start near the Lake Rathe zone hunting 
skeletons and cyclopses.  Watch out for the named clops Tarskuk, he runs 
faster than SoW, so don't bother trying to run.  However in a good group 
Tarskuk is nice experience if you can kill him.  Also watch for Oculys 
Ogrefiend (or something like that).  I always died when this one spawned 
so I can't comment, but check the web sites :)

As you level up a bit or get with a better group you can move to the 
Hill Giant area nearer the Feerott zone.  Plan to be at least level 32 
or so if you want to affect the HGs with spells.  The loot is good 
there.  The experience can be good with the right group, but usually 
isn't great as others have mentioned.  On more crowded servers the area 
is pretty camped, so be sure to kill place holders (lizards, skeletons, 
etc) which makes more Hill Giants spawn.  Watch for the tainted hill 
giant.  When the tainted is killed the corrupted immediately spawns, 
it's a bit higher in level so can be a challenge.  The corrupted doesn't 
have any normal loot, only a piece for the druid epic.  Also keep an eye 
out for Broog Bloodbeard.  It's a named hill giant that's higher level. 
  It doesn't see invis but other than that I can't comment.

Oh, one more thing for chanters... cyclopses and hill giants can't be 
mesmerized since they're giant size creatures.  Root is more useful (and 
charm, if you want to take the risk).
