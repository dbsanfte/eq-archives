Caster gear, reasonable dungeon layout, undead mobs(paladin, necro, cleric),
very easy collects (collects in ec are much harder for instance).

North ro tends to be very popular as well. (all plate armor classes)

Guk is unpopular due to really screwed up design flaws (9 pulls, cant target
, casters and sks, only 3 classes use leather armor and only bstlords are
really liked of the 3,stacked dungeon levels that screw with tracking)

Everfrost suffers from the same leather problem. Let the rogues, rangers,
and shamans suffer. Everfrost is probably the most underused though since
collects are cake here.
