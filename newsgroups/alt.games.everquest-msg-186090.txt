Not to mention you can kill a caster in your group if you dont have
DivArb3. That 20% penalty on da1 is enough to actually pain and
suffering a caster to death sometimes.

With RC2 I've taken off things like tash that can't be removed by any

Adept and even advanced adept can really be worth the points. That adds
