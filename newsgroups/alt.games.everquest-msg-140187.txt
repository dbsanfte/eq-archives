I'd start going to the best AC/MANA/HP combo gear you can get, which
usually lincludes wisdom also. 

A good start is a couple velium fire opal rings, 6 ac 65 hp, you
really get more mileage out of those around 46 plus than plus 7 or 8
wisdom rings. I did not figure that out until around level 53.

Doing some mobs like the 2 kaladim citizen ladies no one does in front
of kaladim (druid = harmony ;)  ) from 43 to 50 or whever they stop
giving xp, you could probably make a bundle of cash selling their
axes, fine steel and other things to the vendors which are right
there. This is very convenient. Once you split them you have one or
the other spawning about every 6 minutes (each is a 12 minute spawn,
but splitting them well makes it tolerable at 6) You can also forage
and busy yourself in otherways in the meantime.

If, like on my server, you can buy most of the potc quest items for
about 10 k or less.. you might be able to build that up mostly from
those ladies and the odd port for money by the time they green out.
Then you can snag the 5 ac 8 wis 55 mana 55 hp flowing thought one,
via the xanthe earring trade in. Later when you buy the stuff from
people in the bazaar again, you can get the xanthe one also. I wish to
heck this quest was put in when I was around level 43..  You could
basically be starting into the planes with at least the flowing
thought one. The other one is 5 ac 10 wis 55 mana 55 hp. These coupled
with the velium fire opal rings (about 800 plat a pair from jewelers)
ads a bunch of HP. Later in the bazaar you could swap out one for a
shadel bandit ring for a couple k plat (6 ac 55 mana 55 hp.)

Those earrings also have good resists. Speaking of resists since your
wis is already 210 I'd swap out whatever shield you have for a sarnak
battle shield, which has resists and 40 hp. Its one k plat in the
bazaar or more, or really a crystal chiten shield might be better, wis
and mana for a couple k. Both those have large AC.

On face I'd swap out the likely to be wisdom veil you have for a
enshrouded veil which is 30 hp 30 mana 2 wis and ac.. oh and I think
10 fire res. Any combo item like that is fantastic, while currently
only being about 2 k plat or under in the bazaar.

Generally I'd go to the bazaar, type /bazaar, go slot by slot looking
at the slot and HP or MANA, then order them by clicking on price in
the list. Scroll down the price until you see manageable things of 1 k
or so. You'll be surprised at some of the great stuff you can get.

Everyone used to say "resists resists resists!" but now it seems that
you'll either res or not, depending on level for the most part, and
all the buffs you get at raids makes the resist gear itself not that
important. I'd stick more with HP/MANA, maybe some wis, with any ac at
all and let the resists take care of themselves as you upgrade such
items.
