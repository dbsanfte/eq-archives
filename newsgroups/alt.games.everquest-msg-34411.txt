    If money is no object, the shaman has a damage shield he can provide,
too - the top-notch damage shield potion. Damage will be low for a PL
project (level of drinker divided by two), but it can be done.

    If an enchanter could heal, they'd be perfect. Damage shields, Runes for
protection, haste, memblur techniques....
