Hello A.G.E.

Well my SoL finally arrived this morning as I was leaving for work (oooh, I
was sooo tempted to ring in sick). My current main character (sigh - 6
others in the late-teens to early 20s) is an Iksar ShadowKnight at level 27.
Where are the nearest spires I can use to get to Luclin? Which Luclin cities
will I be KoS in? etc etc

Basically I just would like some easy advice to help me avoid a long CR on
my first sight-seeing trip. Given that in my 10 months or so in Norrath I
have been addicted to creating new chars I would really like to concentrate
on my SK -  otherwise I guess I'd just create a Vah Shir.

Thanks
