I am on Telstra Cable in brisbane. It has been about as playable as normal
lately considering Telstra's cable infrastructure is totally inadequate. A
good laugh for our US audience: Unlimited download quota accounts got
changed mid stride by telstra to 3gig a month......ouchies.

My biggest problem now is constant zone crashing. I hardly notice "minor"
things like 30sec pauses anymore as I have become used to them. I switched
to a mellee hybrid though. Relying on casting when you have packetloss/lag
has always been a gamble, not just in EQ either.
