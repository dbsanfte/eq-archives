Vivendi Universal Games is closing its Sierra Entertainment offices here in
Bellevue, Washington. The announcement's in all the local papers and is
starting to make its way around the industry. Over 100 people are losing
their jobs locally as part of a larger cut of over 350 jobs nationwide. Some
50 people will lose jobs in the Boston area as the Papyrus and Impressions
game studios are shut down. Finally, about 160 people in the Los Angeles
area will lose jobs.

They're going to keep the Sierra brand alive and retain publishing rights
for some key franchises including the Leisure Suit Larry and Tribes lines,
but will discontinue most of the casual games and home productivity
products. I haven't heard any word on what's going to happen to some of the
other franchises like Half-Life, Homeworld, Ground Control, NASCAR, Lords of
the Realm (weren't the NASCAR products also part of this lineup)?

Vivendi continues to lose money. Last year they reported losses of over $243
million and the first Quarter results for 2004 doubled to over $54 million.
Reacting to these shocking results, the Board sacked most of its management
team earlier in the year and hired a new team that's now starting to make
the big (and long overdue) clean up moves. Although there's probably some
element in this story of softness on the PC Gaming side, I see this as less
an indictment of the PC Games business and more about mismanagement. It
follows the closure recently of the Electronic Arts studio up here in the
Northwest. EA is on a similar track right now and it's not surprising since
they are the ones who actually defined the current "rockstar mentality" that
has pervaded the games development industry for years. Trip Hawkins, founder
of EA, actually used that analogy at the time he founded the company and
literally referred to game developers as "rockstars". Somebody forgot to
tell them that they were also businesspeople.

It's no surprise that the one company currently bucking all these trends
both on the console and the PC side is the one company that didn't have a
CLUE about gaming just a few short years ago, but through the application of
all their acquired expertise at disciplined, professional software
development and effective marketing, is now becoming a dominant player in
gaming. I'm talking of course about Microsoft. I still remember when Ed
Fries, head of the Microsoft games division, adamantly defended "Flight
Simulator" and "Fury" as indications that MSFT was a player in the games
space. And look at them now. Whether it's XBox, XBox Live, a major push into
the MMOG space via alliances first with Turbine and now with Brad McQaid,
key alliances with Brian Reynolds, Chris Taylor, Ensemble and so on, you see
a consistent pattern of aproaching the game market with all of the same
seriousness and competitiveness that they threw at OS and productivity
software. No rockstars, just good business and ever-so-slightly different
financial results ...

I met Al Lowe, creator of the Leisure Suit Larry line, years ago when he
became a customer of mine and we've been friends ever since. He was one of
the great original talents at Sierra, funny as hell and smart as they come,
and it's no surprise that his LSL franchise is one of the few survivors of
today's announcements. Al introduced me to Ken and Robert Williams (founders
of Sierra) around the time that the two of them were just moving out of
Sierra (they sold the company to CUC for about $1 billion). Fortunately, the
founders and early folks got out before things really went south, but they
left behind a fabulous family of developers, testers, producers and artists,
many of whom I've had the pleasure to work with here in the Northwest over
the last 14 years. Everyone involved with the Sierra family is pretty sad
today about the demise of one of the great icons of the industry.

Sierra (and Ken and Roberta in particular) practically invented the graphic
adventure game genre. My first multiplayer game experience *ever* took place
one weekend (1980? 1981?) when I hauled an Apple II computer up to a weekend
retreat with some friends and everyone in all of the families sat together
around the computer and played out and solved Cranston Manor, the third
graphic adventure game from Sierra (after Mystery House and Wizard & the
Princess). For me, one of the great moments in computer gaming.

Damn.
