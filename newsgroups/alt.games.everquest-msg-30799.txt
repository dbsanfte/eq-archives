It doesn't quite cause me to do illogical things in-game, but my early days
(L45) of pulling the Chief room at the Orc fort in EW got the heartbeat
going, that's for sure ..

What was even better was when I'd clear the room of the Chief and Oracle,
leaving the four Elites left .. Then, I'd quad-kite the Elites .. It's a bit
scary waiting for four of them to pop through the wall, especially when you
have to wait for ones that wait a few extra seconds .. When you've got ~1400
hps and things hit for up to double 112's, you don't have too much time to
spare before you gotta get out of there ..

Needless to say, I only died twice in all the dozens of times pulling that
room. Once because I still had aggro (somehow, don't ask) in there, and the
Oracle had respawned .. ouchie. Another time because a group kept pulling
Elites out of my quad, so I had to run back and nuke the Elite to get their
attention back. I ended up going OOM (Quadding Elites is a full-mana thing
at the levels I was doing it ;) and having Ensnare wear off, as well as SoW
while I was running around trying to regain enough mana to Ensnare them
again. =P

That, and any big raid. (Fear, Hate, Vox, Naggy, etc.)
