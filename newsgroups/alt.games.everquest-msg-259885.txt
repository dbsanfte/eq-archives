The best quests will still require a finite number of drops. Those
drops will be camped. Can you do the quest to get 5g or whatever.
SURE. But you can't progress off of it. The ones you can progress off
of i'm sure the kiddies will have locked down until they no longer
provide sufficient returns. Then they will camp the next set. Judging
from the way Blizzard enacted rare spawns, they've learned nothing
from Everquest, and will have many the same problems. Just putting in
a 'hit first' philosophy doesn't change them in any substantial way.
Its still a PvP grouping enviornment and WoW will suffer as a result.
No worries though, i'm sure they have a built-in fan base to make it
more than successful.
