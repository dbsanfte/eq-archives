Huh? Why on earth would you want to "camp" something for days?  Just go and
do something else. If you want to sit there for days, your choice but the
game hardly forces you to. There are plenty of other things you can do.

Anyway DAOC eliminated camping by simply not having anything much to
camp. Have you actually played the game? There is hardly anthing to do
compared
with everquest. Sure you get automatically generated quests but they all
consist
of find whataver and kill it, or give this to whoever. Just like everyquest
only
random instead of designed into the game. Big improvement.

256Mbytes is hardly unrealistic. It costs about half as much as buying the
game itsself and you can use it for any program.

Yeah like I said. Tiny world, nothing much to do.

No. You seem to want a game you can "win". Go play quake.
