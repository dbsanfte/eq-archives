Always. And as early as possible to give everyone clear notice of what I'm
intending at the front of the line. I'm not trying to sneak up on anyone,
I'm just trying to get where I'm going.

Perhaps. What I do is sort of a complex thing based on real-time perceptions
and lots of moving targets but basically it's like driving to the front,
being cognizant of what's happening in the other lane and looking for the
right opportunity to gracefully merge in. Nothing too abrupt, nothing rude,
but make no mistake about it, the efficiency junkie in me is motivated to
get to my destination as safely, efficiently and quickly as possible, so I'm
always looking to get to the front of the line if I can. If someone sees my
signal and opens up a big hole and I see that there's another big hole
ahead, I usually keep driving to the big hole ahead. Can't help myself, I'm
an engineer trying to shave off a couple extra bytes off this driving
routine. ;-)

Yeah, in that situation my rule of thumb has always been to alternate. If
I'm in the merge-to lane, I'll let any ONE person in front of me and then I
expect the next guy to wait for the guy behind me to make the same
allowance. Same kind of thing when trying to exit crowded parking garages
after a game or concert, just seems like common sense and golden rule
courtesy to me.

Hmm, I have a hard time believing that the California Vehicle Code gives the
right of way to the person merging in. I'm pretty sure it's the other way
around: when you're merging into a lane of moving traffic, the moving
traffic has the right of way and you must accommodate to them. But the point
you're making about California drivers is supported by the comments you got
"asking around". ;-)
