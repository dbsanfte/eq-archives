Level aside, Xanamech has decent resists.  Shammy nukes (poison and cold) 
rarely, if ever land on him, and that's at level 65, tashed and malosed, 
or, when it lands, malosinia-ed.  He seemed to be less resistant to magic 
than cold and poison, could just be that I tried that more, as the slow 
was a lot more important than a few shammy nukes.  Other classes may have 
better luck with nukes due to what resist they check, resist mods, and 
(at least for wizards) casting level modifying buffs.
