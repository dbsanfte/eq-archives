If you don't want to kill Frostbite go to the druid named Gerael Woodone in
surefall glade and tell him "I will deliver the flask" After he talks. He
will give you some nitrates. Take the nitrates to the zoo keeper named
Kimble Nogflop at bottom of tiger's cage in Ak'ANon in steamfont he will
give you a regurtonic. Give that to frostbite and he'll will give you the
fish. I do this quest all the time my druid does the first three items
becauses she can teleport and my enchanter does the last part with the nut.
It seems you can give the barkeep three of the items camp and then uncamp
your enchanter and give him the nut. He will give enchanter book.
