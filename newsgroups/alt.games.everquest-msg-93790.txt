If it's the same palce you buy their spells: In shadowhaven, take the
secret exit to echo caverns (through fake walls in a house near the
teleport to Nexus). Once in, head right to a stonewall, click on stone
(actually a door) .. in there's a whole bunch of merchants etc in a
cave. Train there I think.
