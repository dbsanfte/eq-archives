You can still buy and sell, but most likely to wandering PC's rather than at
EC like it used to be.  Chat channels now exist where items can be sold by
monitoring the channel, but personally haven't used it much myself.

It is more and more rare to find a real "newb" these days, but they still
exist, and even untwinked once and a while.  I have recently been playing my
pre-L20 chars and even started a few new ones, and was able to find groups,
but sometimes you gotta solo.  Because Luclin is connected to the Wizard
Spires, places closer to them seem to be more populated with lower levels.

I like EQ for the sheer fun of it, whether it's L54 or L14, so for me I like
grouping and crawling around zones and such.  You'll want to determine for
yourself why you want back in.  Personally, I may not make the jump to EQ2,
atleast no rightaway, but who knows.
