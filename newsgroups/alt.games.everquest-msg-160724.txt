That would limit the usefulness of this thing quite a bit.  One good use I
can see for it is to let close familiy members communicate with you.  E.g.,
if you are playing EQ at home, and your spouse at work needs to contact you,
have them use EQIM to log into your account, and send you a message.

I can see people paying a couple bucks a month to do that.  I doubt,
however, they would buy a second account for it, which is what it would seem
to require, from your description above.
