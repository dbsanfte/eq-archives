    Missing numbers and punctuation has happened to me several times,
auction would read to me "wts Widget 1 k", I would tell seller I would buy,
and when I put 1k in window for item, they would say its not 1k, but 1.5k. I
thought it was a scam at first, just to get buyer to them  and hope they
would pay the extra 500pp, but happened several times and I realized it must
be a bug of some sort. Never had a problem with 1500pp format though, just
the 1.5k format etc.
