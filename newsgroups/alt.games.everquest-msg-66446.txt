You may not have enough system or video memory. All of the nude 
screenshots I've seen are with the new models, so you may want to turn 
them off if you have them selected.

It takes a long time on my system too, though not quite 7-10 minutes (more 
like 3-4). Ocassionally it will stop with a black screen when loading the 
character select screen (can Alt-Tab out though).

Zoning is now a major chore.

That's either a lack of CPU power, lack of video card fill-rate, lack of 
system memory, or a combination of all of these things. 

If your texture quality is set to high, set it to medium. Also, make sure 
you are using single layer sky. You may have to cycle and select it every 
time you play, since it goes back to double layer even though it says 
single layer on my system. The double layer sky on Luclin causes a pretty 
big hit to frame rates.

It really sounds to me that your system (not the game itself) may have a 
ways to go before it's safe to risk high level characters in combat. While 
I'm sure that Verant will make some improvements that will increase 
performance, I doubt it will be anything drastic.

Try setting everything to minimum (turn off models, low res textures, 
etc.) as a starting point and see if your performance improves, then go 
from there.
