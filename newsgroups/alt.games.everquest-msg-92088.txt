They used to be available only in Neriak, now they're also in Felwithe.

Only sold in the brownie compound in LFay, AFAIK. You can go through a 
series of casting illusions (no, I can't remember which) and alliance, etc, 
to hopefully end up in minor illusion form next to the brownie vendors 
without being killed by the guards, or you can just get a druid in wolf-
form to go buy them for you.

Nope, he only sells the researched spells between levels 34 and 44. The 
ones for levels 16-24 and 49, you'll have to actually make yourself, or buy 
them from someone who has.
