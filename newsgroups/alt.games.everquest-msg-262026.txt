Last night, I got my first sub-hour AA. Something I thought I'd never
get. Duoed with a Necro. I have the feeling I was slowing him down a
bit though. =) It was probably much better than a one hour AA if you
ignore the down time involved with the deaths that occurred while we
worked out a plan and mastered it.

What we did, was get an expedition in Vxed. See how many non-summoning
mobs were near the entrance, and have the Necro zone in solo. He would
snare one (to attempt to split) and run to zone. We would wait a
little bit then both zone back in. Grab the snared mob and then get to
work.

His normal solo process was to root/rot it until 40% then kite it with
pet following and hitting it in the back. This of course means that a
resist or two and you need to zone. (particularly a resisted snare.)

After some trial and error we dropped into a process that I did with a
Wizzy in PoI (I'm a Shaman, BTW) I'd root it, and keep casting root
while I sit on my horse. (Chain cast root, with small pauses
in-between depending on how long it will stay before it breaks root.)
With KEI or Canni, I can keep the mob rooted indefinitely and Malo and
Disease Debuff it. The other person DoTs it or Nukes it as desired.

Now, the mob will break root for a few seconds here and there
(Particularly if I cast a DoT too. The time it takes to cast the DoT
and the recast time for the Root seems to give a 90% chance that the
mob will break root before I can get it locked down again.) if the
other person is ready with a root of their own, it's no problem.
Keeping the Mob snared is very important, particularly in Vxed where
some mobs can practically one round me.

Having the second person dosen't really make the killing go much
faster, just much safer. Particuarly when the non-rooter has agro,
because I can root it as it walks slowly to the other person without
having to move if I get a resist.

We were doing this as a Necro and a Shaman, you could add any
additional people who can do ranged damage to the mix and speed up the
process. However, it seems to me that a Ranger might be as good a
partner as a Necro or Shaman. They can snare, and root and I believe
they have better damage output than a Necro. (Not sure) Does Archery
break root more often than DoTs? If I remember correctly the larger
the damage in one shot the more likely Root will break, is that
correct? It'd also be nice if the person keeping agro can take a few
rounds from the mob if we get a bad run of resists.

Any thoughts?
