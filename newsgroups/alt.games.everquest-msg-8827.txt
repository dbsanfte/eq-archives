I wonder what percentage of the people here have him killfiled that he keeps
responding to after all of their posts. I made the mistake of not KFing him
on the server I was working on today when I loaded up the NG and noticed he
had been replying to every single one of my posts...how long has he been
doing it for now...or God forbid...please don't tell me he's been doing ever
since I said that I had KF'd him...that would just be incredibly sad...but
not unbelievable...
