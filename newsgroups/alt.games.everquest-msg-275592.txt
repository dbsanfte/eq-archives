I have an old station account and cannot seem to login to it.  No error, no
'bad station name' or 'bad password', it just accepts the login and shows me
the login screen again.  If I login in incorrectly it shows me an error.

I got tired of this crap after a few times and decided to have it reset my
password by going to the 'retrieve password page', but once entering my
station name, e-mail and date of birth, I click submit and after a few
seconds 'Error 404' the page doesn't load.  AFTER TRYING THIS for about 10
minutes (hoping it was an overloaded server [doubtful, but who knows]) I
decided "Screw it, I'll just create a whole new account."

I go to do that, and get all the way to the screen for picking your forum
name and accepting the terms of agreement.  Well, I pick a forum name and
check the 'terms of agreement' box, click submit and NOTHING ****ING
HAPPENS.  The page just reloads just as it was with empty fields.  No error,
nothing.  If I uncheck the agreement box, I get an error message.

What is going on?  I cannot believe that SOE, the self-proclaimed masters of
MMOGs cannot keep a damn login/account server system running.

Anybody else having problems tonight?  I can't go to the forums to see
because you have to have an account.  I can't login to my account because
the login page just re-appears with no error messages.  I can't use the
support chat because it outside business hours.

This is really pissing me off...
