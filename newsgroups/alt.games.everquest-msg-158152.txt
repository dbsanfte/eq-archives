What I would do would depend on the following factors.

1. Will they offer any kind of way to speed up getting back to your
accustomed level with at least one character?  For example, they could check
their accounting records (since you are hypothosizing that the accounting DB
was not lost) to see how long you've had an account, and give you a level
boost based on that.  E.g., anyone playing over two years gets to start one
character at 60.  One year players start at 50, and so on.  

(Hell, a lot of people would probably love to have a pwipe, if they could do
this.  Great way to change classes if you'd like to play something else).

2. What is my guild going to do?  If most of the guild stays, I'd probably
stay.  It would be fun to go through all the pre-50 stuff with them.

3. What are they going to do to prevent this from ever happening again?

BTW, if *I* were running an MMORPG, an emergency copy of the player
information would be kept on the player's machine, digitally signed to
prevent tampering.  In a major emergency, players could be restored from a
recent copy of that.  It would take a disaster way bigger than the one you
are imaginging to force a real pwipe if I did the game. :-)
