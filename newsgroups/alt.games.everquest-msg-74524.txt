Two possibilities:

1.  You need to do it some more.  "Warmly" is a very
"wide" faction category, it takes a lot longer to
get through "Warmly" and up to "Allied" than it takes
to, for example, get through "Indifferent" in order
to get to "Amiably".

2.  You've maxed your faction standing.  Depending
on your race/class/deity, you start with a particular
"base" faction standing with a given faction group.
You can only go 2000 points higher in that faction
standing before you max out.  In "the old days",
you'd just have to guess when you were maxed.  Now,
at least, you'll get the "your faction standing with
xxx could not possibly get any higher" message to
let you know when you're maxed out.  Your race/class/deity
combination may start with a low enough Priests Of Life
faction standing that even maxed, you're still only at
Warmly, but I would doubt that (you would have had to
have started out KoS for that to be the case).  On the
other hand, my Brell-worshipping Dwarf Paladin has maxed
his Scaled Mystics (Cabilis Shamans) faction standing,
and he's *still* KoS ("scowling, ready to attack").

So most likely, you just need to turn in more fish if
you're shooting for "Allied" status with them.
