Thinking about it your probably right.  but they nixed the mail quest
too.  It's a great quest for a Faydewar born caster to buy spells.  Same
thing with the stew quest in RV.  *sigh*  I guess the vision is truely
Evercamp now more than ever.  Really disappointed in the fact the only
type of RP that Verant sees as RP is Racial tension.  Why can't a Dark
Elf turn to the cause of good, esp if they started agnostic, etc.  For
that matter why can't differences be set asside to deal with the menace
of the Deathfist orcs.  There are quests involving the orcs, in
Rivervale/misty, Freeport, and neriak, but god forbid you have a dark
elf wanting to group with others to protect his homeland from orcs. 
/boggle Verant.
