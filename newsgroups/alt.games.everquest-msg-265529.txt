It is the result of leadership abilities. A while back, they instituted
a separate leadership XP path where some <or all?> of your XP could be
funneled into leadership points. Those points could then be turned in
to get some nifty neato extras such as the targeting ring you saw.

Since I avoid group leadership at all costs, I haven't really checked
out what all is available but to check it out for yourself, the
shortcut is 'l' on the keyboard to get the window up <that's a little
ell.>
