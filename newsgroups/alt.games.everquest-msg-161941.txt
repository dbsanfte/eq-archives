It's called griefing. These guys get enjoyment from hurting others.
From reading your post, I take it you have not yet encountered one of
these 65ish leveled guys that will intentionally root and train lvl 10
victims, just so they can get around the level limit so as to cause
exp loss. Trust me, you will eventually. Given the chance, these
assholes will cheerfully de-level you as much as they possibly can.

Get used to it. Sullon Zek is a harsh server. Worst thing you can do
is acknowledge these assholes. What they live for is angry, whiny
/tells from their victims. Just do your best to ignore them and level
up so you can train and bind-camp their asses mercilessly in the
future.
