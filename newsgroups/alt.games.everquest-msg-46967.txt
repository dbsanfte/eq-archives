Unfortunately, that will never happen.

When I figure out how to automatically kill someone's messages, along with
all topics that they start, I will be quite happy.

Does anyone's Windows-based newsreader do this?  I can manually kill a
person's discussion, but I have to see the original article to do it.  I
need one that can check a killfile for an idiot, and then automatically hide
their threads.
