The eye-candy is cool, but it has the negative side-effect of creating
the perception that Paladins really do have good DPS vs. undead, when
in fact it's still well behind any DPS class.

Necros are _very_ powerful vs. undead, and a Necro with a couple of
Paladin "pets" who have a clue is simply awesome.  54 Necro plus two
50 Paladins in relatively poor gear (no haste item, for example) was
able to own LGuk from Frenzy to Lord, including everything inbetween.
