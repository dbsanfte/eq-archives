SKs get a slot 7 resist tap, which should add 10 more to the debuff.  It 
is disease resist based, so get a shaman to hit the mob with Malicious 
Decay first.  Other than that, as far as I can recall, it's bard, 
shaman/mage, enchanter for stacking MR debuffs.  Malosinia does indeed 
overwrite Malo/Malos/Mala.  So 145 + whatever the bard can boost his by 
over the base 15 looks to be the best.
