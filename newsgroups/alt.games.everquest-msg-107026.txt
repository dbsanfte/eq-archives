    For epics, true. But what about secondary drops? Renux doesn't just drop
the dagger, she also yields a piece of Ravenscale for a helper rogue and the
Skean. General may only drop what you need, but in clearing the house to
spawn the General you can get a variety of goodies. There's a few
enticements to make other classes want to come on your epic raids.

    Personally, I hope I can convince my guild that my 55 rogue should be
helped with her epic. I know what a difference it would make, especially
with double backstab, and I'd love for her to be a more viable secondary
seeing how I already bring her out to Tunare killings. But given my main
doesn't have her epic yet, and it's one of the highly contested ones
(cleric), I'm not sure they'd be in the mood to help with a second epic.
