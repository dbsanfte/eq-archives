Probably the good stuff :p.  I really am sorry i came off as a troll poster.
I thought I stated it earlier that I play an enchanter and love it.  My
normal group is me, an sk, a shaman, a cleric, and either a ranger or rogue
plus another.  They are RL friends so we discuss play styles often.  I'll
admit shamans are not overpowered (see i can admit being wrong I guess), all
I ask is if you think that shamans are incredibly powerful in the long run
(i.e. over the spectrum of 1-65 they are going to have the least amount of
trouble gaining levels without dying based on the wide range of spells they
have).

And again all posts are taken based upon the posters experience.  I've been
down the hob cave in PoN (great fun btw if you haven't tried it yet {not you
Davian}), and i'd say stuns play a larger role then mezzes because of
gaters, but that's play style, some groups like to bring in 3 or 4 and work
the chanter, we let the sk pull and if he thinks its too many he works his
FD instead of me working my mez, its still fun to play the game.

I agree that there are different play style situations, but i find that a
shaman is more suited to a larger variety of situations then an enchanter,
but that's how i see things, you see things different, I don't think you are
a troll for it, I think you have a different view because of it.
