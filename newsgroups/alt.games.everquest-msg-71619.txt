Perhaps this would help with your attempt to feel superior:

Faned - 60 monk - Premier puller.  Perhaps you saw me mentioned in a patch
message once.

Keeni Mistress of Blades - 51 ranger - My oldest character, titled. 
Purposefully kept under 53 to be able to handle the Nagafen/Ragefire camp.
Fungi didn't even exist when Keeni was growing up.

And the rest of the 40+ stable:

57 magician, 56 necromancer, 45 wizard (none of whom can wear fungi).

And a whole slew of random sub-40 characters that I play for fun and/or to
better comprehend the other classes.

Obviously, I "can" and "have" and "don't want to" do the bats & rats &
decaying skeletons, oh my, again.

I'm not much for penis comparison, but when someone doubts that you have one
sometimes ya just gotta wave it around.
