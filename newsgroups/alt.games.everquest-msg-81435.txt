Well well. Nice little scam you have going there gimboid.
Theres all sorts of interesting strings in that .exe.
It also comes with a nice little read me which is included below for
everyones amusement.

Where appropriate, formatting may have been changed to protect the innocent.
My appropriate cynical comments are included.

LOL, thats funny. They essentially claim to have cracked the login server,
and throw in some suitably techy sounding terms to convince your average
user that their claims are legit.

Pay close attention to this line. They are asking you to enter YOUR EQ
username.

Odly they dont tell you to specifically put the password to your account
here.

Im going to run it shortly and do some packet sniffing to see what its
getting up to.

The short answer is, do not do anything with this .exe, it doesnt appear to
be a trojan but actually appears to be an account harvesting tool designed
to play on the unwary (aka stupid).
