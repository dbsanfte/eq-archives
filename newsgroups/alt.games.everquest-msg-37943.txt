I've done absolutely gobs of pickup groups, but almost NEVER ended up
with folks I don't know.  You might want to start spending more time
in dungeons, you'll notice that folks who do dungeons generally do
them for several levels.

Huh?  I can't see how you could think it's not a big deal, unless you
have no intention of raiding.  It's the single greatest downtime
reducer in the high-end game.  Rezzes as fast as you can click,
manafree.

Hmmm, I guess the game has changed a lot with Kunark and Velious.  It
used to be Cazic is where you went to learn to group before Guk or
Naggy's Lair.

If you wanna go on raids, get used to not getting exp.  The nice thing
about a guild is that when you're not raiding, you're grouping with
folks who you know and have grouped with before.  Even if you do lose
a little exp on a raid, the next night when you can join right in an
exp group pulling faster than you've ever pulled before makes up for
it.  Maybe as a cleric there isn't that much of a need to join a
guild, but I would still recommend looking around some more.  The
guild you were questing for sounds like a guild that does the right
things, they may have just had a bad night.  Send 'em a tell, ask if
they have a recruit coordinator.  Or just move on.  I wouldn't suggest
getting bent out of shape over not getting a lot of exp or loot.
