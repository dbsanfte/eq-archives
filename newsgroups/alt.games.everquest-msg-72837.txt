  As Tyger pointed out, "d00disms" (not an official term, but it
works) simply have a way of making the person sound stupid.

  And whether you agree or disagree, it is harder to read a post which
utilizes rampant incorrect spelling and grammar (at least to someone
who is used to reading correct spelling and grammar).  To read
messages like yours, usually I have to slow myself down to read and
comprehend everything you're saying.  When somebody posts "normally",
I can usually breeze right through the message without having to make
any special effort.  Just as you may be more accustomed to typing the
improper way, I have become accustomed to reading things written the
proper way.
