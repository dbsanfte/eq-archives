 So what you have said basically is its okay for these two to come in
and start killing without asking if its okay? So then do you condone
kill stealing as well? Its the same thing plain and simple. You take
something that someone else was involved in for your own benefit.

 And like I said there wasn't anyone there for awhile before and
during my stay. And had they have asked, yes I would have left and
asked if I could join. How would you like it if you were camping the
Ancient Cyclops at lvl 65 and I came in and killed it? Not even ask if
I could help, or when your finished to /tell me. Just waltz right in
and take what, I believe, isn't mine. Seems like the comments so far
are condoning this behaviour. I can very easily go all over the place
and do this since its acceptable behaviour. And then when, or if,  it
catches on what will hapen to the gameplay?

 Thanks for the input, with one exception. Next time you get KS or NL
remember this thread and say 'Oh yeah I condoned this behaviour'. and
pat yourself on the back. Who knows maybe it'll be me.
