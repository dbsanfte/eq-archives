Greetings all,
    I've a friend who won't be using his account during the Holiday season,
and will allow me to do so.  The highest level character on his account is a
33rd Lvl Druid.  Some goals I have:
1)    Not endanger anyone with my lack of experience at being a 33rd Lvl
Druid AKA Solo
2)    Work the druid to 35th lvl to get rid of the bloody spellbook, and be
a better partner for my 43rd lvl warrior.

Is Kiting an option for this character? Single?  Multiple?  What zones could
I kite-hunt in to earn steady - if not good - XP, and be of little danger to
others?  What spells would I use?  I know it is something along the lines of
root/dot/dd/med...rinse-repeat, or snare/dot/dd/dd/dot, but I don't know
what spells to use at 33rd, and if any will be replaced at 34th.
Any and all pertinent info or links to good info would be appreciated.
Thanks all,
Player of Valkir Sunderblood - Dwarven Warrior of 43 Campaigns
Temp Player of Warlin Silverpaw - Drood ;)
