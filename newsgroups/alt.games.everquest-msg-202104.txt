I agree. 

Well I'm planning to purchase a new case (the way HP designed this
case it completely prohibits me from upgrading the PSU even if I
wanted) with a 300W PSU. Couldn't find anything better and yet support
microATX mobo. I'll check on the prices for an additional 256MB RAM
module to rbing it to 512, and maybe upgrade the processor if there's
a discount. Again though, I'm not looking to dump too much funds since
I'm saving up to purchase my own suped up box. :)

With that congifuration, a ge3 Ti500 is the best it can go? As long as
its better than a 8MB ATI Rage Pro and can play Velious and Kunark for
now. :)
