Good point...you wanna play a game, you gotta have a gaming computer.
That's the truth, sorry Charlie if that comes as a shock to anyone.

Gaming computers require upgrading on occasion.  Sorry if THAT comes as a
shock.  Win95 is a crappy old OS.

In both cases it may suck, but, well, life sometimes sucks...why shouldn't
computing suck sometimes too?

Hell, upgrading to Win98 is free if you're not a saint (like me :) )...just
burn a copy from your computer-geek friend.  Yeah, it's against the license
agreement but I HEAR it's done all the time. :p
