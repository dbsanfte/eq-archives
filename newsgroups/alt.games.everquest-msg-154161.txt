Primitive layout, not bad for a first attempt.

1: primary  2: secondary
3: Inventory 4: Inventory
5: Inventory 6: Inventory


This makes actual use of the 4 open inventory slots, while
your layout gave you access to only two... no idea why
you keep the other two open with this plan.

Why Primary?  Because you've neglected weapons.  You
can actually do half decent damage while singing or even
playing songs, if you keep weapons in hand.  Singing doesn't
care what you have in your hands, anyway, and quite a few
bard songs are singing based.

For those instrument based songs, try this.  Weapons in hand
start song.  Click primary, inventory, secondary, timing it
so you hit secondary just before song finishes cast.  Now
secondary, inventory, primary, to get back to full weapons
on.  If you are only doing one instrument song (say haste,
slow, heal) this won't be hard at all.

Even easier though, get a primary slot instrument.  These
are the "one handers" of the bard instrument world.  They
don't care what you have in your secondary slot, so a
juggle works like this: weapons in hand, instrument on cursor.
Start song, wait until almost finished.  Primary, wait for song
to finish, Primary.  Sooooo easy.  You can even do three
songs using that instrument and still do full melee damage with
almost no interruption or effort.

Multiple instrument swapping gets more complex, of course,
turning into something that does indeed resemble a juggling
act.  Personally, I tend to plan song layouts that don't require
this, doing a three twist with a single instrument is about
what I can easily sustain over time... and curiously, so many
useful songs are based on singing or a single instrument that
good combinations that don't require this aren't hard to come
up with.
