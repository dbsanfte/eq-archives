Gratz. We wound up doing him three times back to back on Saturday for
some newer guild clerics. I think we had nearly four groups. (lot of
bored people I guess). During the daylight "waiting" time, we were
pulling everything in the zone to the SF channel for one group to kill.
(They had somebody about to ding 48 or something in their group.) Ixi
can be a fun social event that way.

The fights were non-events, with Ixi going down faster than a hooker
when the fleet's in port, and dropping his usual craptastic wiz/mage
loot.

Get ready for an adventure. I've seen groups who were able to completely
own Ixiblat wipe out at Chardok Royals in some very, very, very horrible
ways. And I don't mean just on the King. Even pulling the Prince can
drive you insane.
