You are right, for the most part we can't predict where or when, we can only
try and form our own plan, our own methods of dealing with it, and how to
best be prepared.

It's way true. I suggest watching the History Channel regarding the
evolution of Terrorism from the French Revolution to present. Very
enlightening. The first real Counter Terrorism force was a British force in
Ireland. They pounded each other into oblivion efore any terms were finally
met. Then that only led to continued terrorism later. The terrorists are
going over history and what it ahcieved, and it's evolution all the time.
Maybe each of us should take a moment and learn from the past.

Yes there is an Anthrax vaccine, please be educated before you tell others.
As for reliability that has yet to be truly tested. There have been problems
with people feeling side effects were harsh.

As for asking me if I ever thought this could happen, YES I did, but this
soon NO. But it's here now. And along that SAME line of thinking, ask
yourself, what other things do you not think are possible, might happen?
Take some simple steps to give yourself some better odds for your family,
and know your position was the entire meat of my post.

30% of 400,000,000 is 120,000,000 people. Roughly a third of America's
population (not considering the rest of the world as it spread via jet and
border crossings). I think you need to simply rethink your silly objections.
That's JUST the mortality rate!

On front lines maybe, not in largely exposed areas. Having a Gas Mask,
especially with blistering agents, will go far. In large areas, it is
diluted, it will have partial effect, gas masks will reduce that
dramatically.

It was a type as I corrected. it is 100KM. Look at the charts.

Who are you to say? The organizations are ORGANIZED CRIME. They are
connected. The best recent estimates are 50,000 to 75,000 global terrorists
according to many figures released.

You method of keeping things in perspective is to underestimate your enemy.
I choose to not do that. I will go on about my daily routine but respect the
fact they will be trying every day, to the best of their ability to kill as
many of us as they can, in any way possible.
