Hi,
Need some help here.
I have an Ati card and in the days following the last patch I keep getting
booted before the character selection screen.
I checked the homepage but I can't figure out anything there.
The game worked fine before the patch now I can't play at all.
Any easy fixes on this or is it tiem to get a new vid card?
Although I don't see why I should get a new card Verant didn't mention that i
needed to update anything with this new patch(.
Thanks)
