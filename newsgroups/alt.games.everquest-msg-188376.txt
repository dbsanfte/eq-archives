I've tried the obvious things - complete file checks, copying one of
my various installations from the XP machine (4 in total, 2 x prod and
2 x test), etc.  So far everyone is still nekkid.  Re-installed
DirectX, no difference.  No new drivers for the graphics available, so
no point going there.  It's just had a complete deletion of EQ and a
fresh copy from the XP machine, and as I write it's downloading files
for the optional zones/expansions (could have sworn those boxes were
checked on the XP machine, but with 4 installations I might have
missed one!).  And I expect the end result will be that everyone is
still nekkid.  If so, it's back to the disks and leave an overnight
download running - LoY will be painful.

It's nothing to do with connection sharing, because I don't use it.
Now, if a certified Cisco engineer wanted to convince me that it's a
bug in the version of IOS I'm running on my router, I'd almost be
prepared to believe them.
