My experiences with my human Inny worshipping necro was that
I was dubious in Erudin and KOS in Paineel.  It took way too
long to get to amiable in the Warrens but it is doable with a little
work.  I think it took somewhere around 1000 kobolds but that
was with killing the necro guy in the Paineel newbie area a couple
times when he aggro'd me while I was in a grumpy mood.

So, my guess will be that a DE necro will be KOS in both places.
For what my guess is worth...
