Well, it depends what you mean..  "How do you handle players who steal your
kites?" or "How should you handle players who steal your kites?".  If the
latter, I 've no idea. If the former, I swear a lot. I must admit that my
other characters have been guilty of this on the odd occasion. Unless there
is any significant loss in health of the mob I really don't understand how
someone is to know that you are kiting it (and if it has only been snared
then there will be no health drop). Now I've got a 29 druid on FV I
understand the druid's frustration with this more. Because of the
underpopulation on FV though it doesn't happen very often but the lack of
population is made up for by the inability to talk the other guy's language
so I do tend to be ignored when I ask them to leave the mob alone. On the
other hand, lol, that is beneficial in as much as I can vent my feelings
verbally, when they ignore me, which makes me feel better and I'm less
likely to get reported for offensive language. Seriously though I think that
it should be taken as an occupational hazard. Just try and repay them by
dragging something nasty past them while they are having problems dealing
with another mob. Did I say that out loud?
