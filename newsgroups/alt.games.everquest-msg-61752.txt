Yes it is. Clarity adds a set amount a constant to mana regen. mana
regen is a fixed X points per second value for a state, like sitting.

Are you seriously claiming that mana regen and hitpoint regen scales
up in EQ?  It does not, you know that. And knowing that the argument I
presented becomes a very simple mathematical equation. 

As for stuff to look forward too, well i look forward to RvR, added
pvE content, more spells, more land, more mobs, and all the other
things that growing games provide.

But the Mez lasts much longer. The area increases. That is in fact a
bonus. Just like going from clarity to clarity 2 is a bonus but
basically the same spell. Now if your asking me if they could have
staggered abilities better, probably they could have. But the game is
so fundamental at this point that there will be additions. Those
additions will add stuff to look forward to also.

BTW I'm not disagreeing with you, I think EQ staggered the goodies
well, and i wish DAoC had as well developed a magic system as EQ.
