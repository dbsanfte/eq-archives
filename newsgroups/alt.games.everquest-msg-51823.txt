Who are you to tell someone what is fun and what isnt? I got bored playing
the whole hack-N-slash thing too so I started skilling in Smithing,
Tailoring, and Brewing. I'm still 16th lvl ( have been for a couple weeks
now) because I haven't felt like H-N-S. I have also made a lot more friends
and a hell of a lot more plat from working on these trade skills. If you
dont think it is fun the way someone plays then just say so but dont put the
person down for it - that is just ignorant.
