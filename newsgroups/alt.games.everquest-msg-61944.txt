Don't forget that when online-retailers claim a date it's usually when it's
shipped to them, then they get to process it, ship it and we might be lucky
to receive orders within a week after the claimed "release" date.

My local store is more honest and simply says I'll miss the first week
certainly and might be lucky to get it the week after that.

The only exception I had was with Diablo II, which actually had a world-wide
release. But the severe server overload kind of spoiled that party.
