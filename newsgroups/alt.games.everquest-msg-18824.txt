Blimey!  Some fellah on Rodcet Nife was offering something like 100pp for
either or all, I can't remember which.  I've been searching for weeks with my
druid and ranger.  Many monks have been told that the quest was fine.  I
managed to get a hold of a guide who's main was a monk and he accepted that the
absence of Ghanex Drah was cause to log a bug report.

Yippie.  It took Verant four weeks to find out what every monk knew in a few
days.
