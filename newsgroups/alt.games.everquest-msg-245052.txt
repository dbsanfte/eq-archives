I really couldn't settle on a good spot to jump in with this, but I felt 
the need to mention the following:

I don't know martin very well.
I've never played with martin.
I've never even seen the content in which martin has probably spent the 
last year or two (or even more maybe) of his EQ experience.

That said, have I heard of martin? Um...most certainly, and enough to 
consider him quite the a.g.e. regluar, without a doubt.
Have I found many of his posts to be helpful, informative and insightful? 
You betcha. He's obviously been around the EQ block a time or two.
Would it be pretty obvious that if someone in a.g.e has not heard of him 
then they just haven't been listening? Yup. At least that's the only 
logical explanation I can come up with.

You were just completely in the wrong to assume he was blowing smoke, 
whether you want to admit or try and explain it away. As has been 
mentioned, you stepped in it. Everyone does sometimes. Now just sack it 
up and scrape it off your shoes with whatever dignity you can muster.

Fwiw, it just bugs the crap outta me when people spout off about how a 
particular class is worthless or at some kind of severe disadvantage. I 
find that more damaging to the game that whatever shortcomings the class 
might truly have. Fact is, whatever problems are perceived are typically 
not really so much fundamental flaws as they are just annoyances to the 
select few who complain about it. What it does is foster misinformation 
and strife.

If you want to criticize martin for being caustic, fine. I get that. I 
can't say the majority of us haven't demonstrated a quick trigger with 
topics on which we feel strongly. However, under the circumstances, you 
can't honestly defend your ignoring of his insights on the very topic you 
are discussing.

Oh, btw, "/boggling fanboi"? If recognizing martin and many of the others 
here as authorities on various EQ matters is wrong, then I don't wanna be 
right. :P
