Firiona Vie is a "role-playing encouraged" server.  It's got a bunch
of rules changes to encourage role-playing:

  + All characters must choose an Alignment.  Some alignments may not
    be available to all classes and races.  Characters whose alignments
    differ too greatly cannot group together and cannot cast beneficial
    spells on each other.

  + Communication is restricted.  There is no "common tongue" -- if you
    want to talk to someone, you must know their language, and learning
    new languages is a tedious and time-consuming process.  (You can only
    gain 1 skill point per HOUR in a new language, and there is a level
    cap.)  And /shout has a limited range.

  + Trivial Loot Code is in effect everywhere.  You will never get
    "special" items (LORE, MAGIC, and I think NODROP) from monsters
    that were "trivial" for you to kill (greens, basically).

There are lots more, but those are the biggies.  According to some posts
I've seen here, the communication aspects are the biggest change.  For
example, how do you look for a group if you can't even communicate with
other players?
