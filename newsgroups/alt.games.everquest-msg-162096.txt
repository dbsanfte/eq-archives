I'd still give the edge to shamanS for who's *more* useful, but the
druid has been tuned up enough at the very high levels that either will
likely find a home, depending on the guild, of course.

I bet there's been more druid epics come into the game in the last month
than there were for the six months preceding this because of their
renewed "guildability".  We have seven leafblowers in our guild now
(being the easiest epic to do) as compared to only three rogues, three
shaman, one cleric, one monk, one bard, and one wizard.
