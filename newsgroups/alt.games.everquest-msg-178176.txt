XP is nice, but I keep hearing of alot of problems with it, I'm
reluctant to upgrade.  I'd consider Win 2000 but it is seriously much
slower on many games (and in general), and a big resource hog.  I'd
prefer to be using 98 2nd ed, but don't want to shell out the cash for
such a minor upgrade.  

I'm an A+ tech, with an AA in computer science.  I don't even remember
what I did to get the memory to work, but there's no problem in that
department, and hasn't been.  This is a new development since the last
patch.

I finally got to read the blue screen, and it said there was an
Exception caused by Nshare.  Nshare is an IP forwarding program, it lets
me share my single IP with my girlfriend's computer - I know win98 2nd
ed has this feature built in but I have 1st ed, so have to use a 3rd
party utility.  I don't particularly want to dump it and pay either the
extra $5 a month for another IP address or pay for win98 2e, besides
this isn't the only problem I've got after the last patch.

After it happened this morning I was immediately disconnected from eq
and I couldn't get any internet at all even with IE, I had to reboot.

I'm also still getting disconnected when zoning occasionally and
disconnected and tossed out to the server select almost every time when
camping instead of going to the character select screen.  After camping
and getting disconnected it says I've got an active character, then once
that goes away eq crashes and I have to restart it. 

None of this was happening before the last patch.  

I have tried the thourough file check.  the only other thing I can think
of might be the custom group ui I'm using, but that seems to be o.k. in
the game.
