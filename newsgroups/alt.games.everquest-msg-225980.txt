    Assassinations can be surprisingly tough. You may not know for sure
where the boss will pop, so you can end up killing more mobs than a
slaughter just to clear to him. Some people end up pacifying their way to
the boss, they get so strapped for time. Once there, the boss usually has a
fair number of mobs in his room. If you can't pacify, you're going to have
one hell of a fight to deal with. Finally, some of the bosses are much
tougher than others. There's one melee boss in the Rujark adventures that
blasted through one of our elemental-geared warriors in a matter of seconds.
Had he not been a warrior, his group would have had no chance to tank the
boss and win. It can also be tough if you need to pacify-pull the boss out
of a room of adds, and it turns out that the boss is a caster that can (and
will) Gate back into the room.

    Pacify is your friend. Use a rogue or Eye to scout the room, and get
pretargets on any mobs your pacify caster might not normally spot. Pacify
the set of mobs behind the outermost set, then work your way towards the
boss. When you've pacified the mobs beside the boss, pull the outermost set.
Once they're done, repeat the process with the new outermost set until you
have a clean pull path for the boss. Then pacify anything else left over and
pull the boss. As an example: in Takish, there's a boss room with a pond in
the middle and the mobs set up like this on the far side: mobA mobB mobC
BOSS mobD mobE mobF. I'd breeak that by moving to the same side of the room
as A, B, C, pacifying B, C, then pull A. Then C, D, then pull B. Then D, E,
BOSS if able, and pull C. Then D, E, and pull BOSS. Using this, you should
at most get one add with the boss when he comes.

    Don't have Pacification? Then use chain aggro. A mob that has been
indirectly aggroed won't pass hate to another mob. So if you aggro a mob on
the end of the chain, you shouldn't get the whole chain. So tag A with a
feign class while standing on the A side of the room, and see what comes.
Feign if it's more than you can handle, otherwise bring it all. If the boss
didn't aggro, repeat the same step with F. After F, go back to the first
step with the new outermost mob. If you do get the boss, and/or can't handle
what would have come in the pull, then get every person with root/mez to
pick a mob on the one side of the boss and cast all at once. That will at
least stagger when the adds arrive in camp, so you can deal with them
without it being an emergency situation.

    Right now, I find collects to be about the same difficulty as a
slaughter. That's what it should have been from the start.

    The final charm seems to point towards some sort of continuation, and
they have announced that they'd like to add themes as time allows. I hope
they do - this expansion is a very nice compliment to other expansions, and
provides a good timesink that will never go out of date.
