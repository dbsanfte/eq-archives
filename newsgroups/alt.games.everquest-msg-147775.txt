Nope, just need for a packet or two to get delayed.  I had 2 to 5
seconds delay in updating HP from self cast healing spells.  That's
2 to 5 seconds with a low ping.  I repeat:  ping doesn't mean squat.
If you make even the slightest forward move it is possible for the
server to have you (briefly) misplaced.  Ever watched somebody with
horrid video lag run by?  after about the seventh time you see them
go past you they may have actually made it.  Hell, I once survived
being agro'd by 4 mobs in TT because the server had mis-predicted
my location and by the time it got re-synced with my client it had
run the mobs far enough away from me that I was able to reach the zone.
You play a Druid, so perhaps you're not familiar with this common
Rathe Mtns scenario:  run up to a mob, attack it, get told you're
out of range, wait (forever, damned slow 2handers) for next swing
while you and the mob just stand there, then you hit it.  Server
suffers minor confusion about PC locations all the time.  Worst
problems are when 'net traffic is heavy or routers are down.  Second
worst when zone is overcrowded.  But even when everything is running
smooth as glass the 'net can hiccough and lose or delay a packet,
which in turn can confuse the server.  HP update delays can kill
individuals (ever been "dead before you knew it"?  ever seen a
Paladin try to use his insta-cast LH on somebody with a bubble of HP
left and end up wasting it on a corpse?), I imagine that position
and movement update delays could do worse, possibly even wipe a
group or raid if the server had you in the wrong place and agro'd
something at a bad time.
