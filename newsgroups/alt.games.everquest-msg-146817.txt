I have gotten that far, myself.  I have actually seen traders on top of the
poles at either end of the trade stalls (the big wooden posts, not the tent
poles, but the ones that look like telephone poles).  I have no clue how

saw him because he had a tinkered jewelry thing much cheaper than anyone
else.
