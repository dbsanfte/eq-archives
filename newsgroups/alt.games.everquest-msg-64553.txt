Hmm it's taking me 3 hours with DSL to download the patch and it looks
like the entire game is getting patched. A lot of  *.s3d files with
old zone names at the front. I guess their 3d modeling didn't come out
quite right. I have to keep in mind that 56k folks have it longer and
are probably downloading all night so servers will be congested
through the next day. Really feel for you dial-ups, especially when
you leave the patch on all night, go to bed, and the thing stops
patching as it has done to me twice so far. :-(
