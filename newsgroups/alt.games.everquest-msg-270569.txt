/Agree

Software development to facilitate/automate internal business processes 
is usually handled by IT.

Software development as a commercial venture is 'production' and is 
usually separate from IT.

Software companies are likely to do both ... the IT department might be 
writing a custom module to deal with some specific CRM req, while 
production is developing Half Life 3...

of course if the software company makes and sells customer CRM 
modules... production might make the module, and IT (and other 
customers) will be treated as a 'preferred customer' and/or a beta test 
site.
