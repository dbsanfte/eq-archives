The problem with shaman as a second account is you can't use cann to
get back mana while you're running the ranger, so they end up being
hamstrung.

The beastlord has similar advantages as the shaman, especially slows,
and its pet does constant *good* damage right from the start without
the player needing to be watching that account. You do lose the BL's
own dps though.
