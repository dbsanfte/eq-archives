THATS what you've been waiting all day for a "whiner" for? so you could put
to use a very old and very boring cliche?

Its bad enough you've been here all morning waiting for such an event,

When I did a google search on you to find out if this is common practice on

Did you mean to search for: alt.games.everquest dumbledore
