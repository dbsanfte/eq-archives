Um, can you explain how the person whose bag you picked up "screwed"
you?  Was the guy who was where you were when you found the stuff the
druid who wouldn't SoW you?

I can't help but think of a scenario where, say, I wanted to go to the
mall but I don't have a car.  Well, I asked some total stranger for a
ride and he told me to buzz off, so, damn it, I actually had to go
take the bus!  I was pretty pissed about that!  Well, I wound up
sitting next to some little old lady, and I just happened to find a
purse on the floor under the seat, so I picked it up.  Well, the
little old lady didn't say anything about missing her purse, so I
decided to go ahead and keep it, and I spent all the money that I
found inside.  Woot, what a good day I had!

Does anybody else think that's an accurate comparison or do you think
I'm way off?
