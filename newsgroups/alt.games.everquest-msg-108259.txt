Damn.. I just cannot figure out how the fu... someone gets to lvl 40 in two
weeks..

Am i really that extremely lousy a player? I play an average of 3 hours a
day, maybe 5 weekend days. Some ppl play like 20hours a day, so i really
dont know how much is meant by two weeks.

All i can say that i am appx 10Played days (/played) into the game as a
VahShir BST.. now lvl32.. I must admin the levels from 25-> has been
extremely slow.. (nothing like 14->25 in paludal.. That did not take long..
2 dings a night :)

I am currently hunting in Dawnshroud, thus pulling dark blue Zelniaks, and a
occational fungus and small zelniak. When solo i get from 1/3 -> 1/2 of a
blue pr. kill. But soloing has it downside.. ie. medding time is truly
boring..

Anyone have a good suggestion for a 32BST to solo?

Cyber
