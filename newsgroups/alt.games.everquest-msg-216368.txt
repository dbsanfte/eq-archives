   I have played a shaman in the past, in fact my first real character,
the first one I got above level 4, was a shaman.  I have lots of very
good memories of playing her.  However, as I started grouping, I found
myself most enjoying my role as healer.  I liked watching the health
bars while avoiding agro.  I was very effective using my healing powers,
and not so good as using my offensive spells.   But of course, if there
was a cleric in the group, then I wasn't the best or most logical main
healer.  In those situations, I have to admit, I wasn't the most
effective at playing Tealeef.  I liked being able to buff, but I found
it tedious to have SO many buffs to chose from.  I liked throwing SoW on
people, but to be honest, often my SoW would bounce because the already
had better.  By level 25, (this way before there was testbuff, of
course) I realized that maybe being a shaman wasn't the best choice for
me.

    I played a ton of class/race combos after that, including a halfling
cleric I got to about 16 or so.  And I liked playing her alot.  When I
decided to move to FV pretty much for good (though I still stray from
time to time)  I didn't have to thing to hard about what class I wanted
to be my main.  Teapray is a fun character for me, and I have no desire
to reroll her.  Well, not true... I sorta wish I had made her a dark
elf.  But as for my Main class... this I have absolutely no desire to
change, even if doing so would result in a more effective duo.   Plus
there are the roleplaying aspects.  Lenny is playing the exact same
character... he just decided to go to magic school and learn some
spells, so he has to start his studies over from level one.  But other
than that, he is the same.  To become a shaman, I would have to kill off
the character of Teapray entirely, and have Lenny "remarry" a shaman
from some other race.  I guess I could say that in a fit of jealous rage
my spirit took over that body of the shaman, but I don't really want to
roleplay the demonic possession from a cleric to a shaman.

   Maybe a more vigorous answer than you were looking for, but there it
is.
