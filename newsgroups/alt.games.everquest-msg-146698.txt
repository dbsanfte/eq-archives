Okay you don't mention anything about the need for good loot just fast
experience and seem to be taking the same experience track that I did so
here is where I went next.  At 31 or 32 I went to mseru and did the
greyhoppers stonegrabbers and lightcrawlers for about 3 lvls in two days but
not playing every day.  At about 34-35 things started going green and lb so
I jumped down the hall to dawnshroud peaks.  In this zone I went from 35-45
in a week and a half mind you I work two jobs and went solo (I am a ranger)
so got no aggro from wolves or zelniaks.  I would camp one of the shroom
beds either the one outside nl entrance or the one to the left of the sseru
entrance and kill zelniaks in between until the shrooms got to be light
blue.  I then set up camp in probably the most underused camp on my server
in dsp.... straight out from nl entrance there is  a little hill that starts
a bowl shaped valley where the large zelniaks spawned.  It was a a flipping
kill fest for 4-5 levels.  46-49 I went to dreadlands but now that is
slowing too.  Good luck to you.   Oh yeah the downside is that for 5-6
levels the loot was almost nothing.
