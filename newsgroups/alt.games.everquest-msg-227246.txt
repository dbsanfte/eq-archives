You specify as /split ppp ggg sss ccc

Fo example, if your group picked up 100p 50g 210s and 118c,  the line 
would be:

   /spit 100 50 210 118

(those numbers are just off the top of my head, btw)  It doesn't matter 
how many are in the group, as it does the math as close as it can (I know  
that now, but not when I originally posted), and spreads it equally to 
the group members.  And, as my screw up confirmed, it only splits to 
those IN ZONE.  And any coin that can't be split evenly goes  to the 
splitter (say, 5 person group and the above numbers, each member gets 20p 
10g 42s 23c, with the splitter getting the extra 3 coppers)

See, guys, I *DID* pay attention to the answers you gave me!  (I just 
hope I got it right!)
