Like the others have said, most of the time SoW donations aren't necessary,
its the thought that counts.  Ports get pricey like you were told, and at
your level, theres still a ton of critters in the nearby area, so no big
deal there, but 10pp to start is the base most times.
As for a bind...usually about 5pp, a lot of people will do it for free, but
like the SoW you asked for someones services with something you can't do, so
an offering is always appreciated.

Good luck, and happy hunting.
