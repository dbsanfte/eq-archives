I use the default new UI.  I shrank the view window down with the viewport
command so my windows don't overlap it, except for the window selector bar and
the compass.  Moved the spell icons over next to my group box, that main box
under that, buffs box down to the same width under that.  Along the bottom I
have my main window and my combat window, and to the far left my hotkey box.

I'm sure there are better UI's out there, but I'm not much of a fan of
tinkering around with nuts and bolts, and they aren't officially supported by
sony, so when sony make a new release I figure there's a good chance whatever
I'm used to suddenly won't work anymore anyway.

I do wish I could get percentage figures for my bars more easily (or at all for
exp) and that might make me switch someday.
