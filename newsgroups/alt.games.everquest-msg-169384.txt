Another way to accomplish this is to take advantage of EQ's support for
multiple key mapping to the same function. To do this, first assign a hotkey
to Sense Heading (say, #10). Then, go into Options and choose Macros from
the pulldown. On the hotkey that you have assigned to Sense Heading, assign
the same key that you use for Forward. This way, every time you hit the
Forward key, you will not only move forward, you will also automatically try
a Sense Heading. You will have maxed your 5 points in Sense Heading every
level before anything else, and completely transparently.
