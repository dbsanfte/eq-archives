Siren Temple, down the well.  If that's not sufficient, you're going to need
to do some exploring or find someone who knows the zone.  Get a group
and go a-killing until you find her.  She's somewhat near where the
Inscribable Pages drop, so anyone working VP quests are likely to want to
join you.

Depends on more than gear.  AAs and group mix is vital too.  A healer-heavy
well-AAd, GoD/MPG-equipped 10 who work together very well could perhaps
take her.  If you're in ornate-level equipment, with few AAs, not enough spot
healers, and don't know each other very well, you might need 25 people.

And of course, more people means more miscommunication and chance for someone
to make a mistake and wipe the raid.  Think of it as similar to killing a
tower named in BoThunder.  If those are cake to you, you'll do fine.  If
they're beyond you, you'll have a hard time.

>> Is there a good strategy to take in the fight. 

Kill, heal, heal AE.  Straight-up fight, in theory.  I don't know if this is
part of the enounter or if our group was just dumb, but, we got a BUNCH of
siren adds, perhaps 25 from repops around the temple and funny pathing. 
Word of Morell (with mez mastery) and Bliss of the Nihil kept them locked
down though, with only one enchanter (in elemental/KT gear, but 250AAs).

Good luck!
