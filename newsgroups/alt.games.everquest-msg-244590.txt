After reading this I just wanted to ask people this question.   My husband
and I run a guild on Terris Thule and we have one rule and one rule only,
yet we have had people leave over it.  The rule is no /anon only /roleplay
if you want to hide your level.  Does this seem like such big deal.  I know
other guilds have this.
We do it because we find people usually are doing it because they are up to
no good, and not realizing people can do /guildstatus on them.
Under special circumstances we will allow it, like if you are bazaar selling
that was at request of a guildie though I couldn't imagine why that would
matter.

Could I get some feedback on this.
