I did the quest as an 8th level Erudite Enchanter before Luclin
without ports (I did get one "drive by" sow in the Karanas somewhere
though). Except for actually turning in the compendium to the ogre. I
waited till 12th and Illusion: Dark Elf for that.

I think it took me in the neighborhood of two hours.
