That's why I was merely frustrated, instead of in tears.  The seller
immediately took off after the trade and wouldn't answer my tells asking to
trade back (not even to refuse, the jerk), but I thought before I started
crying I'd at least get a PC on the item.  Pfew, I could even make a profit!
Whee!!  Good thing, too, because that 300pp represents about four months'
worth of scrimping and saving at the schedule I play on.
