I thought about it for a long while, then I thought "you know
I always wanted to start a necro..."

I guess I am hooked on the game not in my 'time invested' that
some people say. Umm invested? In what? Its a game, not a savings
account. I often wonder if people really mean what they say. Do
they really take it personally when some 'nerf' happens to their
character? They talk about how much time they 'invested' in their
characters and how it was all 'wasted?' Some day all the characters,
equipment, and levels that the player 'earned' are all going to
go *poof*.

"The play is the thing."
