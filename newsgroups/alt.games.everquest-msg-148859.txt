I know of a few of those spots in BB but I would not regard them as an
exploit. It is not they can't get to you - they can and will right away if
you are already engaged with another gnoll but if you are say, fighting a
snake or medding they "don't notice" you as they are preoccupied chasing
down the initial offender.

It's like ducking out of the way of an enraged bull chasing someone else
which could only be considered common sense ; )

If they do notice you by the way - they have no problems reaching you and
smacking 7 shades of blue out of you with friends as the initial aggro get's
all the other gnolls attention.

It's one of the weird freak coincidents where a pathing glitch actually
makes the game more realistic...
