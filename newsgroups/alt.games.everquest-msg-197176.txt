I couldn't find the original post either, but based on my experiences,
it's official policy that unless a camp is for a specific drop off of
a named mob, as opposed to regular experience/loot camps, you HAVE to
share the camp.  Unfortunately, some camps can't truly support the
number of people or  groups that might desire it.  Plus, sharing camps
can cause agro problems if you aren't too careful. 

This problem used to be fairly common.  Nowadays, it's far easier to
find and get to a decent alternate camp/zone when things get too
crowded where you are.  Then again, my main is still sub-60, (yes I'm
a slacker), so it's conceivable to me that it might get worse as you
approach 65.  If so, maybe the coming old-world zone revamps may help
alleviate that.
