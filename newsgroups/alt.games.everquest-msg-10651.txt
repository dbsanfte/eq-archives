Great advice.  I play a bard (now 30th - yay!) and I agree it is a great class
and the most active class in the game.  It's also the class that I believe
presents the most options to the player.  You decide in which area the group is
weak and focus on strenghtening that while enhancing the rest of the group at
the same time.  It can be a lot of work, but it is so much fun.
