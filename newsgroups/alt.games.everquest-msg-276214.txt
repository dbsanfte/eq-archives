I like this VERY MUCH but only IN CONCEPT. The reality is that these 
sorts of things are FAR TOO OFTEN handled with a competent core group 
that pulls their gimp friends & guildies through.

As a recent example, I recently finished the 9th necromancer iksar hat 
quest with a 30th level necro. It involved killing a number of 50th 
level mobs and camping in zones like HS. This is an existing example of 
a character getting access to gear well beyond him because he had a 
group that could hold his hand. 

Similiarly If they introduced this tierd DoN loot, my 70th level gimp 
cleric bot in Kunark armour would just join up with some uber-OoW raider 
friends who would take him through the 'hard adventure' and get him 
'flagged'.

My cleric shouldn't qualify for access just because a group can afford 
to drag some dead weight around. There's a lot of clerics who aren't 
bots, in better armour, who play their clerics much better than i play 
my bot... and yet I'll qualify to purchase teir 3 armour and they won't. 
How does that make sense?

There has to be some heuristic that can recognizes whether or not you 
are dead weight... so many PoJ, Sewer Trials, Flag Raids, etc work like 
this ... a high level core, and the dead weight gimps along for the 
ride.

Yup.

I don't really think players want another playable race, or a new class. 
Without which there really isn't a need for even more zones. Low level 
players and the game in general would benefit from extensive existing 
low/mid content revamps.

Quite simply there is already too much to do at the low midlevels. Few 
players get to see much of what is out there, and most of it is outdated 
and not really worth doing except for the sake of saying you did it. It 
would be better to re-itemize and re-vitalize old zones and quests than 
to simply dump more into the game.
