OK, kill the one AA that interfered with pet canni, and leave the 
several AA that are practically useless without pet canni... as if the 
injury from killing pet canni isn't enough, they have to insult us by 
making it clear they have no idea how their AA system interacts with the 
class?

What about jumping, does it now run off endurance?  What about food and 
drink, do they now prevent endurance loss, or contrawise are they now 
needed to allow endurance to rebuild?   I've asked these questions 
before but haven't seen an answer yet.  Seven of the classes in the game 
don't have disciplines at all, but we've all used the stamina bar (to 
the very limited extent that it mattered)

This strikes me as a very welcome change, many of the disciplines were 
"yeah thats great but I'll never use it because I have to have this 
other discipline ready at a moment's notice at all times"

What -are- the different timers, and which timer does each and every 
discipline use?  Hopefully, there is some mechanism in the game to tell 
us, so we don't have to rely on a bunch of hackers cracking their code 
and ferreting out the necessary details... as has happened before.

Because two years ago you screwed up by killing their mitigation so they 
became unable to pull anything that could keep up with them on the way 
home?  Two years guys.  And monks don't pull much anymore anyway, other 
classes have been forced to learn how and are now better at it.

Wow, nice boost for those of you who have shark plat or plat from the 
numerous cheats.  Here's a way to turn your ill gotten loot into goods; 
we know you were pissed because when you flooded the market with 
hundreds of thousands of plats, prices rose, so your money didnt' buy as 
much as you'd like (reducing your 2million plat to a 1million plat 
value.  Well now we are going to introduce something valuable with a 
fixed value, so no matter how many thousands of plat you pump into it, 
you still have the same stuff coming out.

Meantime, those of you with honestly earned pp, you won't really be able 
to afford to play this game much, and most of the rewards are booby 
prize level, so its only really worthwhile if you have hundreds of Kpp 
you can throw away; the rich get richer and the poor get poorer!

In case you buy one by mistake?  How often does this happen?  If I buy 
an augment, its because I have the item I'm going to apply it to, and I 
apply it then and there.   I'm guessing the main use will be for people 
who buy something that only works on slot 5, not realizing that the 
weapon they are trying to put it on only has slot 4.  Probably a lot of 
CS calls about this, so automating the refund seemed sensible.  Why not 
put a complaint department in all the wayfarer camps though?

This is great news, I really would like some new containers but wasn't 
willing to hang out in bazaar reading auctions to find them.  And it 
should be a huge advantage to the sellers of containers, who can now 
automate the process like everyone else.

What is that in seconds?  (DoT spells list their times in seconds, not 
ticks).  0:30?  Good news to quite a few classes.

Ah, so invigor line won't affect the endurance bar eh?  I assume its

Because new graphics that cause crappy lag are desirable, and the only 
reason we turned off the old ones was because we were bored with the 
look?  Face it, its not the graphics that stopped us from wanting to see 
the effects.

Now if the new spell effects are not as game killing, we may indeed want 
to turn them on... but they should explicitly say so.

Yahooooooo!  Excellent.  I've had to hold the hand of many a cleric who 
was unable to make more than the most occaisional lucky use of their 
pets, woeful indeed since I know well how fantastic the little guy is 
from 54 to 60.  And my own Rage of Zomm will work too, something to 
experiment with although I was mostly thinking of using him in 
conjunction with pet canni (not as a canni target, but to cast him when 
mob arrives instead of a "real" pet that I'll only have to kill anyway 
when the mob is dead)

Mana -actually- used, or mana listed on the spell?   Because with 
conjuration specialization and summoning efficiency, and probably some 
AA, the actual cost to summon will be less than 95% the listed cost to 
summon.  It seems to me pet canni may still be alive and well, although 
only yeilding 30% more mana than it costs to summon the pet in the first 
place, and only after investing in quite a few AA.

This will also be helpful when a pet is nearly dead; old reclaim got you 
practically nothing, new reclaim will get you same as if he was uninjured.

Thats a confusing way of saying things, but I think it means lulls 
weren't working the way I thought (lasting their posted duration, but 
then decaying over a long period of time) but instead -really- lasting 
five minutes.

And now they aren't going to last like that any more.  Doesn't seem 
crippling to normal group action, but going to play hobb with some raids 
where we'd lull a lot of mobs and then move dozens of people past them; 
the much faster decay is going to mean stragglers die!

Aw, gee!  Oh well, I guess this is of benefit in PvP, where killing eyes

I doubt I'll ever see my epic, particularly since he's still going to be

Heh, you might want to remove the spells themselves then... whats 
invigor do but restore stamina?  Jig o vigor?  Did you change them to do 
something useful, or did you just remove the stamina effect and render 
them into "oooh look at the purty lights" spells?

I never saw that bug.  But I did notice that my level 1 enchanter pet 
and later my level 4 mage pet were -not- getting 250 extra HP out of the 
summoned belts someone gave me.

Ok, I thought this was supposed to be the case all along, and instances 
where it wasn't the case were all bugs... do you mean to say "all bugs 
have been fixed" or is there some new method used to calculate purchase 
values that should work universally, instead of on a case by case basis?

Fun stuff.  Ok, now I get to go xmas shopping while they beat my current
