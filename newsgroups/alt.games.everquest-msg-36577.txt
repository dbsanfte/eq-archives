    Ahem - look at the below log - TWO resses! I earned that stack of
Permafrost Crystals, I did!

    It was a pick-up raid, was it not? People on a pick-up raid don't see
the *need* to help others, as the others there aren't part of their peer
group. You were lucky, in a sense - you got valuable insight into a lot of
people in your level range.

    This was where I should have been at my most stubborn, and dropped the
ball. I allowed the organizers of the raid to talk me into coming into the
buff hall to rez. When the inevitable giants came, and I healed one of the
fighters, I ended up with three giants on me and had to Gate low on life. I
got VERY lucky when I zoned into Seb (bound in TT by the orb), as a gnome
wizard was just leaving and I was able to beg a port back from him. Gnomes -
is there anything they CAN'T do?

    This is where things got ugliest. Note when Dan died. Note when his body
got pulled out. Res timer is three hours. And the buff hall had so many
bodies in it when I was there that I couldn't see the floor. All those
bodies had to be pulled out in the time order they died, too. Which
meant.... many people had the timer expire on them.

    As a senior cleric trying to keep order and help folks, that was tough.
I'd cast Reviviscence, see the "expired" message, and send each person this
message:"I'm sorry, but the timer has expired. Your body is unressable.
Please loot it now, and do NOT tell anyone else the timer expired." Since
you kept the log, you can see when the first person broke my request for
silence - a druid whose first action after hearing that was to /shout "All
the bodies are unressable! We've lost all our XP!" or words to that effect.
Like THAT helped morale.

    Between the last time you gave and this one, I think we got maybe three
more resses in. But I couldn't leave, not as long as there was a CHANCE I
could get somebody back that XP. I felt annoyed that I'd been given that
random /tell to come help when I was in EC selling, but once there it was my
job to give it my all. I was glad to meet another dwarf who felt the same
way.

    And I'm a glutton for punishment, as you folks got me back there the
next night when you failed again. ;-)

    Bah, I was being mercenary, I tells ya! I took all them Perma Crystals,
and I KS'ed at least one Vox Bracer off of some poor melee who couldn't
compete with my 'leet cleric nukes!

    If you ever decide to give up on the lower level dragons, give me a
holler. If I ever hit 60 there's a guild that does the Kunark dragons that I
will attempt to join, and I'd recommend you as a book candidate in a
heartbeat. You acted the way a paladin should act.
