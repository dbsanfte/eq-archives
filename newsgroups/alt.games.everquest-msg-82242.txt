Some possibilities:

1. Get a high level druid or wizard to port you.  Hopefully you can find 
someone who can bind you too.  The fact that the only port points are in 
dangerous zones makes this chancy.

2. Take Nexus.  Ditto.

3. Try pulling the plug on your connection to go linkdead while zoning, 
wait until the boat should be around again, and log in.  Not sure if 
this will work, you might end up in the water or something.

4. Jump off the transport and wait for the next one if you are tall 
enough to swim onto the transport or the boat.

5. Take the evil boat instead, I think the transports there land on an 
island.  Of course you'd have to deal with the problem of being kos.
