Rule of thumb would suggest level + 1 times five... which would be
a defense of 135, while yours is an abyssimal 45.  Thats pretty much
the same boat I was in.

Its a classic cleric error, don't feel bad.  Your groups will purposefully

work to keep you "safe" not realizing that they are crippling you in the
long run by doing so.

Your 1hb skill cap is level plus one times four, or 108, you aren't far
off on that (and half the people here will tell you that skill is
unimportant)
while your offense is same as your defense, but your 121 is much closer
to capped out here (again, people will tell you its meaningless as a
cleric)

And yet the root I mostly use lasts the least time of all, Immobilize.
Turns out I'd rather root it faster and could often not care less how
long the root lasts, much of the time.  Its unfortunate that clerics
have no DOT to speak of (Turning of the Unnatural is a sick joke)
so that if I'm soloing, I don't care about duration since I'm going to
break it in a nuke or two, and when grouped the duration isn't
often an issue either, if something really has to be parked I root
it further off and atone.
