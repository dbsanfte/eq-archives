You will not evade me, "Jackal" <the-jackal@cableinet.co.uk>:

>Funniest thing that happened to me was:-

[level 3 moron]

A while back, I was playing my then level 8/9 SK, grouped with a
friend's druid twink. A level 35 iksar monk came up to me and said "I
hate your guild" I responded "Fine. I hate you too" and just continued
with what I was doing. He continued going on a diatribe about how my
guild sucked and only one member was cool. Now, this cool guy (and he
is) follows a naming pattern that my friend happened to mimic with his
druid, so I pointed out that my friend was not my 'cool guildie'.
Iksar kept blathering, I kept putting him down, he challenged me to a
duel. I laughed at him and recommended he pick on something his own
size, like decayed skeletons. He challenged me again, asking if I was
all mouth or wanted to put my actions behind it, I laughed and
declined again. (Almost should have offered to take him up on it with
my druid...) He finally left after giving my druid friend 12 pp -
something which was extra funny because he has over 1k on that
character and visible gear like RMBs :)
