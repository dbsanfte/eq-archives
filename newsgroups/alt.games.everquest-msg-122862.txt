  Find the spires with the Nexus Scion in Greater Faydark.  Target the scion
and say "I wish to journey to Luclin", he'll give you a spire stone.  Keep
that in your inventory and wait.  Within 15 minutes, you'll be teleported up
to Luclin if you stay between the spires.

  This will take you to the "Nexus."  Go through west tunnel and you'll see
some "mini-spires" with the Velious and Odus scions.  Stand on the pad
within the spires and wait.  This is the only tricky part.  You have to pay
close attention... eventually you'll see a message saying something along
the lines of "The Velious spires begins to cast a spell" or "The Odus spires
begins to cast a spell"... if the Velious spires is casting, run off the pad
into the hallway and wait for the spires to go off, then step back on the
pad.  If the Odus spires cast, wait on the pad and you'll be teleported down
to Odus.

  That will put you in the Toxxulia forest.  Head south (and a bit west) and
you'll see a entrance a structure that leads to a tunnel, that leads to
Paineel.  Go through that tunnel, and you're in Paineel.  You should bind
yourself now, because this next part can be a little dangerous unless you
have someone to make you invisible to undead.

  Turn left and run through the tunnel... when you see the opening from the
tunnel, run quickly right down the center... there are two guards on either
side, but they're relatively low in level and if you run down the center,
you should be outside their aggro range.  Run through the "newbie yard", and
on the right there will be an opening that leads downwards, into a room with
a shallow pool in the center.  There are two openings, one of them will
bring you to the Warrens.
