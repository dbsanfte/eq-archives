I can't log in my druid because I camped in Dawnshroud in the tunnel to
Maiden's last night, apparently too close to a wall.  I logged in earlier,
but I couldn't: A) stand up to gate out, or B) be sitting to camp out.  I
/q'd out after asking a level 23 druid in zone to come lesser succor me in
exchange for buffs for his group, unfortunately he'd never heard of the
spell and suggested I /q out (which I was contemplating anyways).  Trying to
log back in gets me to character select, but then I get to stare at the
splash screen until I feel like popping the reset button.  And the best part
is?  No GM's or guides on this late.

And now for the cathartic release, please ignore unless you feel like being
the recipient of nearly identical rage.
