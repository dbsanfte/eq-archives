Talk about DUMBFUCKS, you didn't even get the "gist" of my post cause
you are so blinded by stupidity, jelously or some such shit.

And as far as the post itself, I wasn't pointing out a spelling
error you dipshit!, I was pointing out the fact that other countrys
use the spelling of "colour" (instead of "color"), so I was asking
him which "other country" he was from.  What part of the post did 
you not understand ??



> Why don't you go let EQ push your stool in again.

Because you are still busy "sniffing" the stool tht EQ once sat on.
Its not hard to see viability in what EQ says about people being
onsessed with him when I see shit like this.  My original post was
about as non-EQ as it gets, but yet, you pull EQ in. That says something.
