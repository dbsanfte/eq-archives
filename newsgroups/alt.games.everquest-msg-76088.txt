You have been killing "spiderlings" rather than "spiders"... the only
"spiders" I can think of that drop spiderling silk are the ones
in Feerrot.  EC actually has a decent population of "spiders" which
you might be able to take at 6, a bit further west within the zone,
tagged as "Large Spider"... the "Giant Spider" you will also find
there is probably too high level for you.

If you are still getting exp for the Spiderlings, kill all of them you
can find, spiderling silk is actually used for more practical tailoring
than the stuff the big guys drop.  Make threads and stash them
in the bank for later.

Spiders can be found that are good exp hunting for levels from
6 to 50 at least, probably higher.  One of the best places for them
is Upper Guk, if you aren't KOS to the frogloks there, there is
a large and plentiful spawn of them and nothing that will attack
you while you heal up and meditate.  Level 6 is really far too low
for that, though.
