I'm not sure if they put the real broodmother or giants back yet, but you
*should* be able to do it, although it might be quite hard, you might want
to have another druid or a necro or somebody for backup just in case since
the giant has a few big HP (although if you have ES arms you should be ok,
it just take a really long time)

And be sure to warn the zone what you're doing and ask them to please clear
away from the fort to avoid bugs, then give updates to the zone so they know
what's going on, at least this is what worked for me.

At some point the broodmother looks like she's headed off to the left of the
combine spires (and the fort with giants is on the right), don't worry about
it, there's a bit of odd pathing right there, she will turn off to the right
and go to the giants.

When she starts running out of the cave, camo up and follow her, do NOT
engage Fergul until she has started to fight Gralk and Fergul has repopped
(with the legs) and begun running to the EW zone.

If you get one of the "pet" bugs, where the broodmother decides that one of
the giants is her master, as long as Fergul has repopped you're ok, just
don't get in melee range of the giant or she'll decide to help her "master"
whereas if you stay out and just cast on him, she won't care.

If you have any kind of choice, the best time to do this is later at night
when the zone is fairly empty, to minimize interference.

At any rate, good luck, they're a nice pair of legs, I've had mine since
level 34 (I love high level friends =P) and they're definitely comparable to
the Thurgadin quest leggings (yes I know they don't have circle of misty on
them, but really, who cares, they're a whole lot easier to get, at least for
me).

Only downside I see is that I've been wearing Tizmak pants from level 6 or
so (nice people sold cheap in Gfay) because I like the look of velious
textured pants on my wood elf, but of course now with luclin models,
everything looks like newbie pants.  These are included becuase unlike the
quest/planar armors, they're un tinted, just plain velious leather 1 look
(Tizmak/ulthork/quest armor textures, whereas netted kelp/harmony is velious
leather 2, under the old graphics models at least, now they all look the
same as patchwork except for tinting)
