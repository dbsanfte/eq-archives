Game systems in general need to grow up and simply tie their accounts
into brick-and-mortar banks. Reference my other message in this thread
for how.

Its really not THAT hard.

Oh please... I love how every change gets hammered like its the end of
the world. Yes you should have a Gaming Account that you use through a
normal bank.. Yes you should be able to use that account to purchase
objects in any game that supports it on this planet. The only thing
that really should never happen is that a corporation like SoE can
end-run their own world and auto-generate items that they sell for
cash. Unless of course they like seeing their items devalued.. and
then its kind of self-defeating because people won't feel a need to
buy them for cash. They need to have items with value in order to be
able to generate a item flow in the economy. And when they do so, and
those items are transferred for cash they can charge a transaction fee
for it.
