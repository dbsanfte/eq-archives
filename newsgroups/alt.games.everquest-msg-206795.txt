Overall this is a huge positive change for the Necro.  Basically 20% more
DPS for all DoT damage.  Nice, and likely the pre-cursor to a line of AAs
that does the same thing that SCF does for nukes to DoTs.  DoTs are horrible
now compared to nukes when you factor in ID, SCF and the length of your
average xp encounter.

Right now though, EA4 items are damn rare, and they havent changed Accursed
Extension or Vengeance of Time to Burning Affliction type effects on Test.
Hopefully they will.
