Monks can FD if something still goes wrong...sneak fails... bad 
pathing... wanderer...  ranger is lost and the cleric goes LD...

Monks can also take the pull hits better than most rogues IME, and I 
prefer rogues not to pull because there seems to be a good chunk of 
aggro 'for the puller'... I'd rather see the monk pull and FD breifly to 
hand aggro to the tank if necessary, then the rogue pull and have any 
unnessary aggro...
