Oh, come now... You know the whiners can't grasp the concept that
degrading into name-calling and wild accusations in a post to Verant
is only going to get their message ignored or deleted. They seem to
think it's "cool" and will get a faster response if they show how
pissed they are or something. Then again, most of the whiners are
incapable of expressing grievances in a rational, mature manner...
