Hmmm....
One would think "livid" would be derived from "liver" or some RED object. I
associate it with being so angry I am red in the face like the character
that got so angry he blew himself up in "Big Trouble in Little China".
Blue - revenge is best served up cold - so is anger but most of us can't
achieve that state.
