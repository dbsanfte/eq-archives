Thought of another tip for soloing a chanter:

Enchanter pet kiting

Summon an animation. Find a target, preferably  a slow mob, like a
scarab beetle, or mummy. Tashan the mob, and run away. When spells
refresh, stop running and root the mob. Now cast your best DOT on mob
and med. Re-apply DOTs as they wear off. Keep in mind, the mob has not
touched you yet, your pet is not fighting. The goal is to get the mob
to 50% life using just DOT spells. Once the mob is at 50%, let the
root break naturally. Let the mob hit you to get your pet fighting.
Once pet is fighting, run away. Now you are kiting the mob, while your
pet chases it and strikes. Keep running away until your pet finishes
the mob. If mob stops to engage your pet, hit it with a DD to reaquire
its attention. Distance also plays a part in agro, so don't get too
far away. You want the mob chasing you and ignoring the pet that is
killing it.

Not as exciting as soloing whole camps, but it is more conventional,
and probably safer.
