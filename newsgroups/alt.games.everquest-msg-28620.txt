There have been persistant rumors about high fishing skills allowing you
to pull in rare gems and such. My fishing is over 150 and I've yet to
see it. You will get some odd stuff out of various bodies of water, such
as some smithing components from Ocean of Tears. But I think you can
eventually get them at *any* level of skill.

Nope. At least not as I've noticed. I think it's constant at all levels.

Don't the gnomes with tinkering skill have the ability to make one? Or
am I dreaming again? There's some special fishing pole out there, I know
that. I don't have one, though. I'd suggest doing an equipment search on
alakhazam to find it.
