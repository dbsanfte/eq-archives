Keep the items.  Most people who quit EQ have returned to the game 
eventually.  Few who recieve freebies from people who are quitting 
really benefit from them, they didn't -earn- them (and I've recieved 
several such bequests over the years on one character or another)

Plus, as you note, new things come in to the game every day, and very 
little ever leaves it; it can't be anything but good for the economy for 
-some- things to leave at least!

Splendid
