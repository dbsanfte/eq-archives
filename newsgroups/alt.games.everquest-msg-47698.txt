The hermit in South Karana was already camped, so I headed to Lake
Rathe to tangle with the gnolls.  I killed the 2 gnolls that conned
blue to me, got bored, and started killing the gnoll shamans that had
had weapons.  I got a message that my faction with Vensh Mal (?) went
down when I killed the shamans.  It sounds like they might be "good"
gnolls.  Is my halfing druid now in trouble somewhere?
