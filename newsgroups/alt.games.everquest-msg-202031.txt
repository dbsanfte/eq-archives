I am wondering how these skills exactly work? I saw a few times - but
very rarely; "mob x tries to hit you, but you parry/dodge/whatever".
However; this is really really rare. Seen it with fighters and so -
but my rogue has never seen any of it in all 30 levels (although parry
is near to max and dodge is at 120-something). Do they add directly to
AC instead; or do they just give a very tiny chance to avoid an
attack?
