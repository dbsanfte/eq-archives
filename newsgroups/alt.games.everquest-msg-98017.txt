 Oh yeah, the new models are sweet if you like hunched over scowling lady's
looking at you. lol  I couldn't wait for the new version to come out cause I
thought they was gonna improve the models, to my shock I jumped out of my
chair when I finally got to see them. I've decided I like seeing the old
ones better so I just cut off all new models and am looking at old one's. I
really would like to know what kind of idiot designed these new people. Oh
well, all the fussing and stuff won't change things and there sure as heck
not gonna fix something they probably spent alot of time on, as least I do
still have the option of changing it back to old one.  =)
