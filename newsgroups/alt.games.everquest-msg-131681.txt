Why would that be unpronouncable.  It's just a question of figuring out what
the correct vowel sounds are.  I recall it being pronounced Yehovah, but
upon looking at the word, that doesn't seem like it would quite work, given
my recollection of Hebrew, which is quite rusty now.  As for it meaning
Eternal, never heard that one before.
