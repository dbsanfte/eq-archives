Thank you all for your input!

I'm still not sure what im gonna get im thinkin athlon XP as it is cheaper.
I'd like to get the new Asus mobo and the antec case I think.

My question is about Mwave. When you go the barebones system and you change
the mobo/ram combo is it smart enough to only show compatible RAM/MOBO/CPU
combinations?

I have not been able to find the right combo of brands im lookin for. Is it
very difficult to install a new MOBO in a new case?
I have never done this but im very comfortable installing new hardware just
have never done anything like this.
Is it hard to set up all the power cable and LED wires? That is my greatest
worry.
