In all fairness, I strongly suspect that one will get nerfed soon. It would
seem to be the most widely recognized "problem" area that I see. Personally,
I don't have high enough casters to completely have a feel for it, but as a
bard, I certainly saw the change in the game immediately. You now see
casters regularly taking on mobs 5 or more levels sooner than they would
have before. If nothing else, I'm very, very much expecting to see this one
nerfed to not take hold on toons below 45 or so (much as they have done with
several other buffs).

It may well be that Monks were "over" nerfed. The fact that they were cut
down seems justified too me - they were clearly too powerful. That said, SOE
may well have been too agressive, but I see quite a few 55-60 monks still
kicking some very serious arse. They can't tank all that well any more, but
IMHO they I certainly shouldn't have been able to tank some of the things
they were tanking before. Tough call. Monks are meant to be damage deals who
are tough to hit, but perhaps don't take a punch all that well when they do
get hit. At least that's the way I see it. A tank, on the other hand, should
be able to get pounded all the hell and keep standing. SOE certainly would
appear to have missed the distinction between having a monk not take a hit
all that well versus them just plain getting hit all the time.

My point, on this, is that screaming and shouting and crying in the corner
is whining - pure and simple. SOE did what it their right - they changed the
rules of the game. They did so for what I would argue is a very justifiable
reason. They screwed up, they said so, and they *tried* to fix it. They may
well have gone too far in it, or approached it the wrong way, but I fail to
see how calling them "fuck heads" or calling the Monk "worthless" addresses
things in any kind of accurate matter at all. It's shallow, and stupid. The
Monk is still a very worthwhile class - I fight along side of them often,
and I still love to have them around.

BTW: He may or may not be right. One way or the other, the "intelligient"
response he gave certainly proves him to have the debate capacity of my 2
year old. She does, by the way, offer far more witty dialog.
