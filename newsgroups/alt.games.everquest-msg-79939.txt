Oh, this guy.

He's the same one that started all those rumors about "The War" that was
supposed to involve dragon attacks on various cities, and all sorts of other
things.

He's gotten really interested in the backstory of the game, and has come up
with a history and lots of theories to explain many things.  This is good.

What's bad is that his history does not agree with the history as revealed
by Verant, and a lot of his theories directly contradict the official
histories.
