I've been playing since Sept 1999. I have a 56th level druid. My playing
time is around 117 days. If you've been playing 2+ years ad have only gotten
to level 17 you have more calm and patients than I do.

At your level I was hunting crocs in Oasis. I cast "Snare" then "Fear
 Animal" and nuke nuke nuke. Wash, Rinse and Repeat. When you snare and fear
the crocs they walk away slowly and YOU don't take damage. On other NPCs you
can't fear you have to get good at kiting. "Snare", run SoW speed for a bit
and nuke. Run more then nuke again.an again etc.

I'd say 80% of all my exp up to low 50s is from soloing using these two
techniques. Since NPCs at my level now summon I have to group. Since they
nerfed zones like Fungus Grove in SoL I can't snare or root. I'm stripped of
being able to PLAY LIKE A DRUID. I hate that. I'm forced to group.period.
Quad kiting raptors got old. Quad kiting is casting Snare on four NPCs (you
got to be fast before Snare wears off. Ensnare will work better as it's
duration is 10 minutes). Run WIDE circles around them so they are all in a
tight grouping (best on wide flat areas). It's best to quad kite the same
type of NPCs as some are faster than others while snared and won't stay
grouped. Then you cast an AE DD spell. All four NPCs are hit and it's the
most efficient use of mana for a druid.

As others have mentioned you have SoW. Before you get below one bubble of
health and the NPC has more health that you do run your ass off toward a
zone line! While running hit the "space bar" and you'll jump slightly ahead
of the NPC. If you get below a bubble of health you'll probably run to slow
to be able to get away.

ALWAYS use /y (yell) when in trouble. This will tell others that you are
close and which direction you are from them and most time will come running
and assist.

If you don't know how you die THAT is your biggest problem. Analyze what you
do and stop doing it. Try another tactic and level your character. If you
have tried these tactics and you still die you need to quit the game or play
another class. I hate to be blunt. Good luck.

*note* One problem I have with Kiting an Fear Kiting.I've done this so much
my melee skills are low. I recently got my epic weapon and my 1HS is only at
157. At level 56 it is capable of being much higher. A good way to build
melee skills is to charm an animal that can't do much damage to you.
Example.Rats in WFP. Charm it, give it a hit point buff (skin series of
spells) and then break charm (casting camouflage) and it will attack you. It
can't do much damage to you and will give you time to get through the skin
spell thus, building melee skills.
