Most melee I group with have those stats nicely maxxed out with Fo7 and 
Diaku, and Wrulan, assuming they aren't maxxed without the buffs that is.      
If they still are not maxxed, FA stacks with those for 140 in physical 
stats and 140 ATK.  For raid envirnoments, there is no question that IoS 
and Talisman is unmanagable, they are single target spells vs group 
spells.  At level 60, I can see where IoS and stacking with other buffs 
is better, FoS is only 405hp at level 60.

At level 65, with Fo7, Diaku, Boar, Wrulan, (all group buffs) stats are 
buffed by:
(4 buffs)

STR 120
DEX 105
STA 60
AGI 60
HP 544

At level 60, FoS, Rhino, Brute, Raptor, Cat
(Here we can see a noticable benefit to the IoS buff strategy)
STR 67
DEX 60
STA 50
AGI 52
HP 405

If we go with IoS, Kragg, Boar, Wrulan, Rhino, Diaku, Raptor
(7 buffs)

STR 163
DEX 150
STA 105
AGI 60
HP 395

I can also keep about 8 people buffed with FA for
STR +140
DEX +140
AGI +140
ATK +140

At level 60+ how many melee won't max out, or come close to maxing out 
with the 4 buffs above?  Also consider that the amount of HP per Stamina 
is a diminishing amount over 200.

Personally, I max my stamina at 305 with just Boar (+60), str, dex, and 
agi are not terribly material at that level, and, I get more hp.

It's pretty rare that anyone wants the Agility buff at all at level 65, 
the amount of AC gained is minimal, and it takes up a buff slot.

The only time I am asked for IoS is a cleric with HoV and self buff mana 
regen on him.
