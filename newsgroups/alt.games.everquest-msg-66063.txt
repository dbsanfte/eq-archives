*** TRUST YOUR CLERICS ***

CH-cycling seems a great idea on paper, but in reality on a raid, it's
simply too risky usually. One cleric lags, LDs, missed their turn, etc.
and you have a dead tank on your hands, and very high agro clerics. Even
with 50+ person raids, and fast hitting mobs doubling for 1100+ per hit,
CH cycles are surpassed by a good team of clerics mixing heals every
time.

I prefer 2 cleric, 2 pallies, and sometimes a bard twisting a max of 2
songs.
Lots of small heals provide a more steady stream of healing, and less
wastage. Chain a few small heals, watch hp meter, ease up a little
unless you hear 'goes berzerk, then chain again. Lag always screws up CH
rotations, for us at least.

We actually went back to trying CH cycling on the 4th warder - I was MT,
totally unbuffed (3.8khps 1400ac) - and decided to *trust the clerics*.
When we went back to raid healing, we killed him. Lots of clerics,
backed up with pallies, druids and shaman, will generate much more
level, and smaller, specific healing agro

CH cycling is a good step forward, and good practice for the high end
ubermobs. You have to know how do to it, and be able to do it, in order
to know when and where it will be of use. It's not, IMO, an 'every raid'
tool, but it's certainly a good addition to the high end raid arsenal.
