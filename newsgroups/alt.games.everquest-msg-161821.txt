Here is a chart I found some info posted a while back that I have found
to be accurate when I have worked on faction quests.

    [Assuming "Indifferent" starts at an arbitrary 0]:
       -2800        (lowest)
        -751        ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you
     750 to 1200    ...looks upon you warmly
        1200+       ...considers you an ally

Furthermore, I've verified the bit of EQ conventional wisdom
that says that factions max out at +2000 points over base.

Base is what your race, class and religion are
to the faction in question.

Generally whenever you do anything to raise or lower a faction
such as kill a typical mob that faction raises or lowers one point.
Up for that mob's ememies and down for that mobs friends.

However, some quests can raise or lower more than one point.
Also, some named important mobs such as Kings can raise
or lower faction by huge amounts.
