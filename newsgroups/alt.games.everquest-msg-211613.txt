I will bite the troll bait and tell you why I think Mages do not suck.

First, a well played mage does more damage over time, in a group than any
other class at the same level, given average grouping situations.

There is a nice controversial statement that should get those posts running
: )

But the reason why I say so is :

a) Mages can summon the best pets with summoned focus effect items, armor
and weapons - They do a nice solid background damage over the duration of
the battle,
b) Nukes and mini nukes that, if cast properly with summoned focus effect
items, kick more single blow ass, than almost anyone else; and
c) I play a mage and so I am biased : )

The combination of a and b over the duration of a group combat means the
mage kicks more mob butt than anyone, including the one dimensional wizards
that always have to chant OOM

If I am in a full group then I almost always do 1/3 to 1/2 of the damage
perpetrated by the entire group, to the larger more dangerous mobs. And
without getting agro.

They also have some other great attributes. Their transport options are not
the best in the game but better than many.

They can camp indefinitely in one login with the help of stuff like the 100%
weight reduction bags

They do some of the best caster buffs in the game ~ focus effects

The bottom line is that mages are allot of fun to play.

I dont care if they are hard twink. I find that I level as fast as other
classes spending about the same amount of time on line as me.

I dont claim mages are the most useful class to others. They _can_ be very
useful in a group - They certainly dont suck any mob's knob.

Some of the comments in the original post make me think that the poster has
some more to learn about his/her class. Such as how to pull long range mobs,
how to avoid agro etc.

My advice to the original poster is to group with some other mages and get
some friendly advice about how to make the most of the class. I have learned
allot more from other experienced mages than I have by myself.

Cheers.

Sausage.
