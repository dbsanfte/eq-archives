Invis spells, except for the improved ones (I think) are always random 
duration up to the max amount.  Charm spell, not the Dire Charm ability, 
are also always relatively random, up to the maximum, as the charmed mob 
does a check every so often against his magic resistance.  Same thing is 
true for root spells, most of them anyway.
