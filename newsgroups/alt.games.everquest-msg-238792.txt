I don't want to be either.  I owe it to my group to be the best cleric I can
be.  My groupmates owe me the same courtesy.  Ignoring your questions should
have been your first clue that your groupmates were not good team players.  I'm
guessing if you would have offered to assist / pacify for the shaman, (who has
better AC and HP and *should* be able to melee a little bit), you'd have gotten
the same silence.
Bah.  The more I think about this the more I agree with your decision to call
it quits in that group.
