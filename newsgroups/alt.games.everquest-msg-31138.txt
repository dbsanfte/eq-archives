Ever hear of the guide program? *Those* are unpaid employees. I'm just
a player who obeys the rules of that game, and expects everyone else
to do the same.

Not my place? I do not enjoy seeing idiot names running around in the
game, destroying the atmosphere of a fantasy environment. I want my
gaming experience to be as immersive as possible. The existence of the
/petition command gives me the ability to bring name violations to
Verant's attention.

I'd say it's *clearly* my place, should I choose to do so.

How so? Quote me the actual rule that the name "Lokari" would break,
and state how it breaks it.
