Or was this Quellious? I have run into a Druid who does this there. I was in
a group in the LOIO and he joined. I was healing, snaring and rooting adds.
Yelled out OOM and watched as the tanks would die. Even jumped in and tried
to melee at the last second. Still yelling oom. Then I see LAMEBUTT DRUID
auctions: WTB BCP. After the seconded fight the Leader booted him.

Later at the fort in FM Druid LAMEBUTT LFG. I worn our leader but he invites
him anyway. After the 3 fight with jerkboy never getting off his butt I
disband. The leader tells me WTF, why did you leave. My response I do not
die so some jerk can be a exp sponge.

Now that I am in OT I see him LFG a lot or yelling for Clar. He seems to do
this a lot. Guess he pissed off enough peeps he is no longer welcome.
