Actually, Jakys the monk was kicking butt with Tirra my shaman for quite a
while before I wandered off and started Tiru, and he started Jakugg. So it's
not really a new alt- it's a very old main. /grin. Unfortunately, I started
the cleric because I was playing the shammy just like one. So I'm not really
sure how well we were playing, but they both got to level 26. Looking at
Tirra's stuff now... sigh. I may yet equip her to something respectable.
I've got a barbarian smithing friend who may put her in the lower level
cultural, if I get the funds for it.

Two more levels!! I'll get there.

What's really fun is grouping with my 53 necro and rogue pet and 55 rogue,
and the rogue being impressed by my pet's l33t skillz.
