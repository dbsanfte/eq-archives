I'm having major problems identifying with your view of soloer's.

*grin, maybe because thats's mostly what I do, however, it doesn't take any
particular skill to group, there are plenty of people there prepared to
instruct you on how to play.

To play a bard in a group is a simple enough thing, most people want haste
and or mana, and possibly play a heal now and then, you might even be asked
to lull, Mez, and in a raid situation play resists.

Not that thats all you can do, you can maybe even charm a mob and have it
'distract' its former comrades, but most groups are not able to cope with
that kind of unexpected help, even when the bard is shouting DO NOT ATTACK
my pet %T it is HELPing KILL the mobs...

I see too many hopeless players dragged along by better players in groups,
or PLed, (Maelin Starpyre seems to be particularly bad for this).

I'm proud to be able to play either solo, or in a group, but unless I know
and trust you already, I'm not likely to be found grouping with you anyway
:)

I love my bard, once I discovered AE songs and Blood of the wolf (so I could
stop worrying about lagging and losing selo's whilst kiting, I made 18-52 in
a weeks play, haven't got much further than this, mostly because Circle
Kiting was putting me to sleep and my melee skills were fairly sucky, having
not hit anything for 30 levels.

I fixed this two days ago, by whacking on Anlut Heavenfall until my melee
skills were in excess of 200, sadly he has since been nerfed, so it's no
longer possible to use that method.

Favourite hunting spots?

Cougars in IO, its possible to hit upto 30 or so with Denons, then Spirocs
in TD (around 20 per pull), and later Umbrous Toilers in ME (as many as you
can stand).
