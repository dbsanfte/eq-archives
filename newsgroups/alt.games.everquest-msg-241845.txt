  All I can say is good luck until Sony figures out the problem and fixes
it. I have a new video card with all drivers up to date and I've went thru
all the help files and web pages that give advise on this and nothing helps.
You can try this page out and see if it helps. Didn't me but good luck to
you.  =)

  Another thing, just be prepared for when you do these steps to spend a ton
of time reseting all your colors, friends list, hot keys and so and so.
