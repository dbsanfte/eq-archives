His "point" has *nothing* to do with my opinions regarding tailoring.

I was *not* asking for more successful combines on leather padding

*stupid* I can't get better at tailoring when creating leather
padding when my failure rate is still high (34%).

*Of course* I can raise my success rate by raising my tailoring
skill.  You're truly the master of the obvious, you argumentative
dimwit.  You need to learn to keep your idiotic snide comments to
