NPC's named ! are placeholders you see from time to time when something
gets screwed up in the database and the actual details on a spawn are
unavailable.

If you look around closely, and know the zone well, you can often identify
which mobs are missing.  In this case I'd think perhaps Regis and Zhorak.

Since they don't behave like the "real" NPC's, though, location within the
zone isn't a good clue
