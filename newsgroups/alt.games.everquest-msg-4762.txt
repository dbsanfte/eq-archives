I would love to reply to this ad to help any group I am in, but alas, I get
us killed all the time.

I am a 24 Dwarven Warrior and need a lot of help on the aspects of pulling?

1.  Most important, how do I get one (or at least just a few) mobs to
attack?

2.  What should I take into consideration when pulling a mob?

3.  Is my class/race combo good for pulling?

4.  What other questions should I be asking???

Thanks for any and all help. I really love the game and want to be a better
player not only for myself, but for the people I group with...  I really
want to learn how not to aggro the entire Estats of Unrest again!
