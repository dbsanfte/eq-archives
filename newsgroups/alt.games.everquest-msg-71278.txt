Well, as both an AC and past EQ (and am now getting back into) player, I
can tell you that they are vastly different.  In AC, it is much easier to
solo play and survive.  EQ is almost impossible to do so - although not
completely so.  If you plan to solo in EQ, you just have to be prepared for
a loooooooong climb up the ladder and many many many many deaths.
EQ is definitely more race and class based than AC and therefore somewhat
more customizable, but it means that there's also a lot more to keep track
of in EQ than in AC.  One major thing being food and water.  You HAVE to
eat and drink in EQ or die.  Fortunately, once you reach 5th level or so
and can cast spells, there are summon food and summon drink spells, so if
you can survive the harsh lower levels long enough to get those spells, you
don't have to worry about food and water.

There are also differences in magic system.  You have to inscribe your
spells to your spellbook from scrolls as well as memorize them afterwards -
and you can only memorize a limited number so choose wisely when you learn
the higher level spells.  In AC, you know how much mana you have and how
much mana a spell cost to cast (although the  mana conversion skill could
lower that cost).  In EQ, all you have to go by is a mana bar - no numbers,
even though you know the mana cost of the spells.  I think there are
programs to compute how much mana you have.  However, the spells are more
diverse than in AC and most classes can summon familiars, known as pets,
which can help out greatly on those occasions where you find yourself
alone.

Another big difference is in inventory handling.  While you have many more
spaces to wield items, you only have 8 actual slots to carry items.  You
can get things like sacks and backpacks that add additional storage slots,
while only taking up one of the 8, but those are expensive and items that
can be placed in them are limited in size, depending on the type of
storage.  So, for your first few levels until you can afford to buy some
sacks or pouches, be prepared to do a lot of back and forth to town runs.

That's a quick over view of EQ vs. AC.  Both games have much to offer if
you can stand the differences in game play.  I will definitely keep my AC
account, but will also play EQ occasionally now.  Keep in mind that this is
just my personal opinion from what little experience with EQ I have had.
My first outing with EQ lasted a whole two or three months - I got EQ when
it came out and switched to AC when that one was released.  Hope this
helped, and hope I don't get flamed by all the rabid EQ only people.
