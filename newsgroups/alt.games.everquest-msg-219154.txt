What duos work well with rogues?

A friend is thinking of starting up a rogue, and we're trying to decide 
what works well for duoing, as we adventure up. (instead of just PLing)

I figured a Pali would work well, as he's got some healing and tanking 
capabilities, both which work well with the rogues limitations and 
abilities.

We also thought about BLs, Bards, SKs, and Shamen. I don't particularly 
want to run another bard so that's out, I'm happy with just one :). I've 
got a few toy alts (SHM at 14th, BST at 11th for example), so it 
wouldn't be long before they could group with a new rogue for example, 
but I was hoping someone who's got experience with a rogue could suggest 
what pairings work well of the above, or others...
