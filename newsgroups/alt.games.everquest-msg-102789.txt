The difference between a good player and a bad one. A bad one won't
know. A good one will. But ether way, its still their mana.

Another person who forgets who is in the position of power.

Get pullin and quit your bitchin. You're not getting str. If you're
encumbered and can't pull, someone else can or quit looting so much.

Another good example is the haste spells. Alacrity doesn't last very
long and costs a buttload of mana. I will drop to augment if using
alacrity is interfering with other enchanter duties (as it will if the
pulls are all three or so and there are three melees or more in the
party). Let the melees whine. It's more important that I be able to
mez and (lacking a shaman) slow than it is to keep alacrity on them
rather than the vastly longer lasting augment.


> Just because
>enchanters are the most powerful class doesn't mean you know everything (or
>even a lot) about other classes.

Irrelevant, I could be clueless but it would still be my mana. Feel
free to make requests, but if the caster refuses, deal with it.


>You play a high elf, don't you?

Dark elf actually, but I do like how I look as a high elf.
