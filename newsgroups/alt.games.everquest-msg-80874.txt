When Im playing my cleric and monk together (57 and 60) I cast the cheal at
1 bub hp left.  Of course I have the advantage of knowing my exact current
HP, my disc (stonestance) and mend usually up too,  but I cast cheal at
6-700 HP left, if I have 2 mobs, I cast it at 900-1000.

When I have 2 mobs, my cleric never gets agro from the cheal, what I do (Im
talking about velketor btw) i've been meleeing one mob already, then 10 or
so seconds before i need healing, i switch targets, and stay meleeing that
mob for 10 or so seconds after the cheal lands..  I'm familiar with the mobs
in Velk though, so I pick my first target anyway based on cleric mana/my
hp/mend/disc/mob hp.

If im not below 1k hp, I don't bother healing myself before before i run off
to pull again, but if im going to pull 2 or 3 at once, I cast a celest heal
before the pull, just to maintain HP to build agro so i can cheal.

Thats just me soloing though, sometimes I forget to cheal.. sometimes I like
to see how much I can heal, I'd scare the shit out of a tank.. but when its
just me whats it matter to anybody.  If I cast a cheal at 600hp and fizzle,
I'm still generally good to re-cast it in time, if the mob is being
difficult and hitting regularly over 100, i /disc stone while i wait for the
cheal to land.

I only cheal when the HP healed is more then 1.5k.. theres nothing worse
then seeing a cleric keep casting cheal at 50% hp.. well, other then the
cleric letting him die :)
