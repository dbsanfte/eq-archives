Freedom of speech allows you to express yourself however you want in a
public place, within limits (i.e. shouting fire in a crowded theater).

You are paying money to join a private world entirely owned by Sony.  As
such, they have every legal right to limit what you can and cannot say.  If
you come into my house and swear up a storm, I have every legal right to
kick you out of my house and tell you that you can't come back, and to get
the police to come and force you to leave if you don't.  Same principle
applies here:  Sony allows you to pay money to join their private service
but still has the legal right to kick you out.  If you don't like them, stop
paying them money.  But you can't force them to allow you to say whatever
you want to say.  Freedom of speech doesn't come into this at all.

You have every right to say "Sony suxxors" in a public place, of course.
