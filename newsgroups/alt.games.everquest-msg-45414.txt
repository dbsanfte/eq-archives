Err...far as I know, the entry to ST is not pickable. Would be a bit
ridiculous considering the item that any other class has to give up in
order to get a key.

First Brood Talisman:
Neck Slot, AC:15, Str/Dex/Agi/Sta/Int/Wis/Cha+5 Hp/Mana+50, 
MR/PR/DR/CR/FR+7, All/All, Weight: 0.0

You'd be hard pressed to find a better neck item for any class (deep, deep
inside North ToV is about it), and the key requires sacrificing this item.
