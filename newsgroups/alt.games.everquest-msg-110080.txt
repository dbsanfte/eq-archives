The plot thickens...

I come in after todays patch, enter Erudin and using my new found tracking
skill notice that Leraena Shelyrak is up. Or is she? She appears to have had
a slight name change to !Leraena Shelyrak and what's more when I get there
"she" is a human male with a beard and not a nice Erudite Cleric Lady!

I tried the note anyway.

"Thanks for the strip of rolled up cloth." and that was it.

Guess I'll just have to wait for the next patch (or Zeb's maintenance -which
ever comes first). Out of curiosity - is she present and correct on any of
the servers that have had their maintenance already?
