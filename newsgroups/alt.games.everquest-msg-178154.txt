Bandits in PC are usually camped by experience groups.  Nothing worse
than someone wanting to PL the bandits.  You can take any character up
to 24th on the fiends which are plentiful and won't bother anyone. 
Fiends are all over the place and the ones near the bandits are still
mostly dark blue at 23rd.  At 24th they start to green out so I move
on then.

With a druid helping, I'd say Echo Caverns needlite room would be the
next best for you.  You can go to low 30s there.  Needlites hit very
fast but a good DS will make them toast quickly.  I leveled my bard
from 24th - 30th there before moving on to Dawnshroud Peaks.
