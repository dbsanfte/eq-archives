There's two types of DS potions. The low end ones are (Lvl/4+) and
cost somewhere around 120p (I think) to make a 10 dose. The high end
ones (lvl/2+1) should be at a cost of about 300p per 10 dose if your
alchemy is high enough. Not sure, I till fail those about half the
time so have to charge over 500p if a friend is desperate enough to
want me to make em. 

Either way, you're right in that they get outrageously expensive (not
to mention pretty damn useless at low lvls) if you try to use them in
exp camps.
