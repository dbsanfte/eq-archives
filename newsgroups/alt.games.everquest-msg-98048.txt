I believe it's 5% as well, but I've never paid a lot of attention
to it.  And the mana ratios are skewed anyway because there's
no specialization checks listed.  It would seem "likely" that
Celestial will pass more checks, further improving its ratio,
as one levels.   As would CHeal, etc.  But I've no idea if that's
valid or not.

Purely OT, but I wonder if anyone knows when the specialization
check is made?   I *know* I've seen different behavior on spells
*potentially* due to the order.   When trying to cast CHeal on
low mana, for instance, I've seen the timer bar appear on screen
and then disappear with a "not enough mana" message.  Other
spells (and CHeal when *too* low) just display the message.

It's my understanding that you have to have enough mana,
regardless, prior to starting the cast but it sure doesn't seem
like it works that way.  And this behavior is relatively new;  I've
just noticed it in the last month, maybe less.
