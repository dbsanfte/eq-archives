Those that were left got killed pretty fast, then people started running
to his next port of call to get killed all over again lol

>Did you even seriously try to beat him, 

LOL - some mobs aren't meant to be killed. This is one of them. 1800+
melee. 26 second DT. Over 2 billion hps. Sure, we fired a few spells off
on him, but I'd venture to say that he'd leave the zone before getting
killed. For some measure of his strength, he was seen fighting Yelinak,
and lost under 5% by the end of the battle...

1 cleric was camped, and everyone had banked keys already. We knew there
was a strong possibility of the script misfiring and didn't want our
entire guild, plus all our ST keys, lying at the bottom of a
crashed/repopped Sleepers.
