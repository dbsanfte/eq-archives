For KEI the spell itself costs ~35k in bazaar, usually, and 900 mana.

For Aego the spell costs around 2500 plat currently, and a peridot
(10.5 plat) and 1000 mana to cast. For Blessing of Aegolism, the version
which can affect lower-level people, the spell usually costs in the
region of 20k plat to buy, and casting costs 2000 mana (and four
peridots, 42 plat).

Both are level 60 spells.

SoW, on the other hand, can be cast by level 5 shamans and level 9
druids and costs 40 mana. So, about a twentieth the mana cost of KEI
and about a fiftieth that of Blessing of Aegolism. The spell itself
costs less than simply *casting* the single-target version of Aegolism.

Now, you will sometimes find chanters offering free KEI, and sometimes
even clerics offering free Aegolism (although usually clerics will want
their peridot cost covered). This even though Aego will cost about 5-10
minutes to med back the mana lost, vs. maybe 12 seconds for SoW.

However, personally I usually just use a dose from a 10-dose SoW potion
when I need a SoW. I can live without the hassle, and I *need* SoW
rarely enough that the cost (about 7 plat per dose) is not a big issue.

I have also been known to go to a newbie zone and offer a free BoA.
I've given up on this lately, as the number of people who came (one each
time for the last couple of times) was not really worth the cost to
me in peridots and mana.

It's not so much a matter of comparing apples and oranges. You're
comparing grapes and watermelons. :-)

Feel free to request donations for casting SoW - but given the relative
casting costs, don't be surprised if people are reluctant to donate a
large amount.
