Took 5 trys at Trial of Exe this morning - my first time(s).
Early on we had a 65 warrior and a mid 60's rogue, 64 cleric
and 2 folks I've been grouping with a bit recently - 61 shaman,
61 ranger (and me, 61 mage).

1st try I went OOM way to early.  Remember, a 61 mage without his
new pet is not that much more effective than a 60 in these things,
you simply can't use FoT in there.  (plus, FoT without level
61 focuses isn't very impressive dmg/mana compared to other
spells - especially for a conj specc'd mage)

Changed out the rogue for a 61 rogue and the cleric for a 65
cleric.

2nd and 3rd times we got pretty close - 3rd time we had 2 mobs
left in 4th wave and the melee's got split.  As far as mana goes,
that was my best one, 35% at the beginning of wave 4.

That's when the Warrior left - he was being an ass anyway.
Claimed I wasn't using assist (/em looks at his assist key
in the 4 slot where it has been on ALL characters for many
years - /assist Dexodromide)  Hmmmmmmm, got news, the only
way I was getting a target was the assist key.

We picked up a 61 warrior instead.  First try with him, we
lost on first wave - he and the rogue got mezzed, then the
cleric.  Lucky to survive.

2nd try we got to 2 mobs left in 4th wave again - when I went
OOM.  Thing is, if I hadn't burned as hard as I had earlier,
we wouldn't have made it that far.  I think that warrior just
needs to learn to switch targets quicker.  Right after seeing
the exp message I hammer my assist key until I get a target 
and /pet attack - there'd be a good 2-4 secs before I got a 
target.  Maybe that would have saved me a couple of last second
nukes earlier and given me a bit of mana to finish with.

Anyway - The warrior, shaman, ranger and I are going to try
again tomorrow.  I got a horse, so I can med during all the
fighting.

And at this point, I'm ready to retract anything I ever said
about mana pool not making the difference between a fair mage
and a good mage - a bigger mana pool would have made all the
difference in there.  With KEI on I have 234int, 325ish +mana,
and the 250 +mana from the KEI.  Problem is, I can't give up
the bracer/earring slot for int - they provide to much benefit
when all my mana is going to nuking.
