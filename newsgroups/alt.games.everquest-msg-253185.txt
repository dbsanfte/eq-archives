I think in general when someone believes something about you that is not
true, the honest thing to do is to correct them.  Not in all cases, but in
any case where it may matter.  Most people consider gender important.  They
treat with you not just as a male or female roleplaying character but also
they treat with you as the person behind the toon.  To allow them to treat
you as a female if you really are a male is a lie by omission.
