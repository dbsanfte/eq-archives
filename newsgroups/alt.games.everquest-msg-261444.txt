Well after you included my outlandishly long screed on the evils of

Pets are available from level one, charms from... hmm, I can't think, 
somewhere in the teens.  While people tend to not use charm till much 
higher levels, except for bards, I'm not really sure why; charmed pets 
are great at every level.

Yes, adding the word "might" would correct the error without padding out 
the text much.

I did think, though, that the answer to the question "why is it I can't 
hit the mob I have targetted"  might be worth inclusion.

If you are aiming at newbies, then the section on rampage and flurry 
aren't too pertinent, if you aren't then the lack of a paragraph on 
Enrage is appalling.
