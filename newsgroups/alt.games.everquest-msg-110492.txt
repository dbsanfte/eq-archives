well, its a fair comment, but im sure people will still want to port
characters through, its still EQ.

And that in a way is what i feel is weird, if they are calling it EQ2 then i
think you should be able to upgrade your chars to it. If it is totally
different, then call it by another name. I wonder if the amount of clients
you loose by not using a well known name (EQ) will be more than the users
that will drop out just becaiuse there is no backward compatibility.
(probably not, but there is always a chance).

-as an aside, I always felt that calling the interface between the company
and dissafected clients "customer service" opened a whole different level of
bitching.  Not being able to get something to work software or hardware wise
is a legit complaint, but moaning that the sword you got from a mob isnt
good enough seems daft.  I cant help feeling that if they called it tech
service or something like that, it would avoid all the complaints about
shitty CS you see. ...the CS may be shitty, but can anyone cite a mass
market computer game that has better?

Naddo - long day at work and a couple of beers, im ready to take on the
world
