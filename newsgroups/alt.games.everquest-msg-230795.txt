Just looked up the shaman ones again, and one is a componentless avatar, 
upgraded by the level 65 Feral Avatar, the other is a decent poison DoT.  
The DoT would be marginally useful due to it's ability to stack, but, 
it's a lower damage to mana ratio than the level 65 poison DoT, even when 
I consider that I have a BA3 item, and not a BA4 item.
