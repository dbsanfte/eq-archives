I was simply defending freedom of speech as something much more important
that trite crap.  As a general thought, it seems to me that constitutional
case law concerning the Internet as it applies to free speech in any
definitive form, does not exist.  To say however, that the courts have never
found that the First Amendment has been applicable to the Internet as a form
of speech, would certainly seem to be incorrect.  The notion of the Internet
as a relatively new medium is reinforced when compared to a slow moving
legislative process.  The laws and courts have simply not caught up to the
explosive growth and its resulting implications that the Internet has
achieved.
In the meantime, the ISP's should care about freedom of speech, here in the
US at least.  It is true that an ISP is a corporate entity and not the
government.  However, a potential ISP monopoly over allowable content would
allow for seventy year old, crotchety, white corporate rich men to
be the judge and jury of what can and cannot be said.  As such an
integrated and fundamental form of communication that the Internet has
become, this would be a mistake.  Who is capable of defining "acceptable"?
You hate ETP and his posts; I await each new post of his with utter
anticipation.  I guess you're annoyed so you might as well get to decide for
me.
Your position invokes to me, a slippery slope that eventually descends into
an Internet of blatant censorship.  I do not think a TOS should usurp the
Bill of Rights.
