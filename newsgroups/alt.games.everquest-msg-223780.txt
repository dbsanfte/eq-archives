Weapon skill will become unimportant but not for quite a while. I would 
concentrate on 1hs weapons first. I believe the best dmg/dly ratio weapon 
is what you'll want in your off hand, once you get to your mid-twenties 
or so. Until then, I'd go with the fastest weapon you can find to help 
keep your skills up. As far as variety goes, I work each of the various 
weapon skills as much as I can, simply because it's important to me, but 
I don't suppose there is a great need to work them all other than the 
prospect of one day getting a very good weapon on a raid or such and not 
having the skill to use it.

Also, get your butt over to Katta and get the combine instruments first 
chance you get. They cost in the neighborhood of 10-15pp each IIRC, but 
they're a good bit better than the stuff you can buy at your typical bard 
guild hall. It's kind of a tough trip at lower levels, but doable if 
you're careful. Vah Shir bards might find the trip a bit easier, I've 
never played one.
