Before they did all the smoothing out of levels, eliminating hell levels,
death was a fixed percentage of the amount of XP the previous took (about
12%, if I recall correctly).  It worked out to about 2.9 blue bubbles in
most levels, half that in hell levels (because the bubbles meant about
twice as much in hell levels), and and a bit more in the level after a hell
level.

Anyone know what it is now, after the level changes?  My last death was in
58, and I lost 8% of the level (2 blues).

In particular, I'm 60 now, and am wondering how much I've got to get into 60
to not lose the level on death?
