I had some confusion the other day when we were in CoM because it seemed 
like the 60+ group that was also killing reavers got around some mobs.  
When I write my post the other day, I got confused about how they got where 
they were once because of the mobs that were still up and wouldn't have had 
time to respawn.

I posted another CoM raid in our events yesterday and mentioned that our 
Rogue should camp his Mage there in case the Mage piece drops.  He sent me 
a tell saying that he probably wouldn't do it because he didn't know how we 
would get his mage up to Neh.

That's when it hit me how the other group gained entry at least once.  I 
remembered all of the Duel messages we saw.  I -know- they had a mage in 
their group ( I saw his pet ), and I'll bet they had a Grav Fluxer in their 
group, too.  So, I assume they fluxed the mage up top and CoHd the rest of 
the group inside.

So, that was the solution I proposed to person in our guild that has our 
only 200+ lockpick rogue and only 50+ mage.  We kill Neh, and if his piece 
drops, he logs his mage.  I duel him and target him ( maybe having to jump 
down first ) and he gets a running/walking start and I flux him up top.

Is this doable?  Heck, it's probably a standard for some people is my 
guess.  If this is the best way, where is the best place to flux him up?  
Neh should be spawning right above the gazebo that is near the BR building.  
Assuming the mobs around the gazebo are controlled, is this the best place 
to do it?

Or, is this much easier solution doable:  We kill the BRs until Neh pops.  
The MA aggroes Neh and we all jump down ( all will be Lev'd, obviously ).  
Neh will try to path to us and eventually warp to us, allowing us to fight 
her downstairs ( along with the adds she brings and the ones that are 
waiting for us at the bottom of the jump ).

Or, another solution: We get to the reaver building and the Mage logs in 
and duels there, and dies.  He consents us.  We drag the corpse with us as 
we move to Neh.  After we kill Neh, if the piece drops, we have the Mage 
log in and rez them.

The mage doesn't have CoH, so we can't use that any way in this whole deal.  
The best solution is get another Rogue, obviously, but we don't have one in 
the guild and would like to make this an all guild event.  Our guild helped 
take the General 3 times last night for a good friend's rogue ( and his 2 
guild mates ) so we could get him to help if we need to, but that would be 
more of a last resort.

For all I know the mage piece is triggered and this brainstorming is just a 
waste.  Oh, well.  All of your input is welcome.
