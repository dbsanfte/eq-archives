 >He made a wise choice.

Well, no, it wasn't, really. It *would* have been a
wise choice if we had season 1 and season 2 of B5
and didn't already have season 1, 2 and 4 of SG-1.

Not that we don't like B5. We do and will buy the
series one day. But we got kinda burned out on a
few years ago when they showed the series over and
over and over. We must have watched the whole thing
3 or 4 times in a row. We're just waiting a bit be-
fore we buy it.
