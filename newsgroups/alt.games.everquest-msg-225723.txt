While the malaise line does increase hate, my experience tells me its 
not by much at all.  This coming from a 52 shaman, 52 mage, both of whom 
have gone up against plenty of opponents where casting mala-x was 
definately the best plan.

I've also used Tash line as a chanter, and OOS as a bard, and neither of 
these are particularly high aggro either.

I often land this on incoming, well before any hint of an assist call, 
and the only time I've ever been spanked for it was with an SK puller 
who decided to FD after I did.  I'd rate it above Cancel Magic, but far 
far below slow (and worst of all, resisted slow); its zero damage and 
doesn't seem to annoy things much at all.  I even use it to single pull 
mobs with who'd be likely to bring friends if struck with any kind of 
damage spell, although Cancel Magic is the best thing I've found for 
this so far, and  even Slow often works unless the buddies are 
particularly close together.

Mala-x line is handy in situations where you really want slow to stick; 
as I note, resisted slow is worse than slowing in the first place, and 
if you cared about the mob being slowed, you'd really rather not be 
slapped around by an unslowed one.  And if you have to cast slow on top 
of a resisted slow, its even worse.  Mala-x is faster, less mana, and 
almost ensures your "second cast of slow" (really your first, but the 
second spell you land) doesn't get resisted.  By 52 I think I was 
casting it on every mob worth thinking about.

Its also useful in a situation where you are grouped with lower level 
casters; you might not be resisted but they often are, either completely 
or just partially.  Double the average damage of several other people 
for something as quick and cheap as this?

Funny thing is, I tend to use Malaise a lot.  It seems to be just as 
likely to stick as the higher level Malaisement and Malosi, but its 
cheaper, and probably less aggro.  And in most cases, if you can stick 
the line at all then the resists aren't so bad that you won't be 
sticking everything else with just malaise.  Biggest drawback of the 
line is that it can be resisted, and so often if you need it, its 
useless.  At level 60 you get a spell which Can't be resisted... as a 
magician, I never do, which is why my level 60 spell in the line (mala) 
goes for 200pp and your level 60 spell (malo) goes for 60kpp

At any rate, this is a long winded way of saying "I don't mean it does 
*not* increase hate, I mean (as I think I implied clearly) that I don't 
think its a "very high" aggro spell... contrast to Slow, which is the 
reason shaman are often guaranteed a seat in the honored "first to die" 
pantheon hitting raid targets.
