I still get confused when I hear one group of folks praising GM's (including
Guides), and another group of folks basically cussing at GM's.

Dynan tried hard, but he was less than effective at best, for whatever
reason.

I understand your few instances when you interacted with him turned out
well.  But understand, those instances do not represent the majority.  In
the end when he left, I wished him good luck and good riddance.

You need to look at it from both sides :)
