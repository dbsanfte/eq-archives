The fact it is nodrop is not the problem, in fact I think that part is
great! It is easy from a programming point of view to check what race a
char is and the quest should not even be given, Also a point which one
person picked up on is that the armour is Half-Elf equipable... When was
the last time you saw a Half-Elf Cleric? The Paladin quest is also
bugged. The text is truncated and you have to know exactly what to ask
for in order to get the molds. I cannot believe these were tested at
all.
