Although you probably already know this as well as increasing aggro
fast weapons *in the primary hand only* increase damage because of the
straight additive nature of the level dependant minimum damage bonus.

It begins to become significant around level 53. At 60 the speed of a
weapon can really skew the raw ratios.

Also, more HP never ever hurts, even for a ranger.

I was a BIG proponent of the WS when I was level 51-52'ish. Now I'd not
use it. It doesnt generate *enough* aggro and sometimes I want a lot of
aggro very very quickly.

Other times I'm MA'ing and it'd be useless anyway.
