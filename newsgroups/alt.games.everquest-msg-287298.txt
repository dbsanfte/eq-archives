-= how and why did it start?. -=
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The harassment didn't start by itself, so someone must have been. there at
the. outset to give it a firm push and set the "animals" after me. It looks
as. if I was set up in June 1990, and the timing indicates someone from
university was. responsible.

>One thing which has been missing from this. discussion is this simple
>prognosis: that maybe he is right. and that, despite his admitted
>mental. condition, there really is a campaign against him organised by
>now-influential ex-students. of his university.

In May or June 1990, Alan Freeman on. Radio 1 read out a letter from someone
who had known me for a few years,. who wrote of the one who "wore out his
welcome with random precision". (from the Pink Floyd song). Freeman went on
to say to the writer "that's a hell of a letter you wrote there".. The
indication is strongly. that people I had parted from soon before nursed a
grudge against me and were trying. to cause trouble for me.

The. suggestion is that Freeman might have shown the letter to other people,
and things could have snowballed from there. Right from the. start the real
source (security services presumed) didn't announce themselves. as the
origin, but let the "talkers", the radio DJs, believe that they were. the
originators. Think about it; if. you announce, "we're MI5 and we have a
campaign. against this bloke" then people might not go along with it; but if
you say, "everyone else is getting at. this bloke because he 'deserves' it"
then. people will join in with fewer qualms.

>Why would "they" wish. to assassinate your character?

It's the classic case of hitting a cripple to prove. you're stronger. Why
would the. security services expend hundreds of thousands of pounds and more
than six years. of manpower to try to kill a British citizen? Because they
are motivated by people who. knew me at university and feel personal
animosity; because they knew me. to be emotionally weak, and it is in the
nature of bullies to prey. on those known to be weak; and because they can
rely on the complicity. of the establishment, which the security services
manipulate and derive funding from. This. is England's biggest humiliation
today, and. the British security services are intent on preventing their
humiliation becoming reality by continuing their campaign. of attempted
murder to suppress the truth from. becoming public.
