Heatsink/Fan
Thermaltake VOLCANO 9 CoolMod @25-35$ US. - Large aluminum heatsink
with a copper insert. Large fan with a speed adjuster. I run mine at
3300rpm, which is very quiet. 

Medium
Artic Silver II (thin layer) @6.00$ US (small tube, good for at least
10-15 CPU installations or more)

You shouldn't have to open your case and have a fan blowing inside. Do
you have a case fan (or 2) to move air through the case? It's not
enough to have a large fan on just the CPU. Having a fan mounted at
the front of the case blowing in, and one at the back blowing out,
will remove "dead" air that can build up when the case is closed. 

A couple of Vantec Stealth 80mm fans would work great. Quiet and
inexpensive at @12.00$ US. I know other people who are using Alpha
case fans.

Which model Athlons are you running. The "B" revision cores are on .13
micron dies, and run cooler than the older .18 models.
