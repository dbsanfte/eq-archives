Fine, then what haste are shamans casting at that level?  Celerity?  Do they
even have that one yet?

Pretty much every planar zone.   I was thinking about Plane of Nightmare
(regular) in that specific message, although there are many others.  Head
down to the hobgoblin caves and see how close you get to the mephits (best
experience in the zone pre 65, and best chance of spectral scrolls in any
Tier 1 zone) trying to root park things.

The shaman has a chance?  How...  you can only root one at a time.    The
enchanter has a good chance to mez all 4 at once.

And Word of Morrell is close to unresistable on anything that can be mezed
(and even some things that can't.)

And my opinion is the only place it will work is a wide open area, or with a
group that is willing to wait forever while thier monk FD's his way to tiny
pulls.

Obviously you're not.   First, decide whether you're talking about self
buffs only or not.  Below you note that a shaman can have clarity on too, so
we shouldn't count that as an enchanter's advantage.  Yet here, you want to
exclude shaman buffs from the enchanter's hitpoints.

Arcane rune does not cost a component, and casts immediately, whereas torpor
takes a good 30 seconds to work.  30 seconds where you're snared and can
barely move... which isn't a good situation to be in when you're trying to
root park 4 mobs, (as you suggest a shaman can do).

And no, shaman buffs will not give him 1000 hit points.   They don't give me
1000 hit points, and I get much more out of the stamina than a shaman would.

Focus of the Seventh - Increase Max Hitpoints by 544
Spirit of the Boar - Increase STA by 60   (x3 hp per stamina = 180 hp)

See above.  You can't have it both ways.  Either exclude clarity from shaman
mana regen, or include Shaman buffs in the enchanters hitpoints.

And thats not even counting the other 5 people in the group.   The shaman
being full of mana won't mean a thing when the shit hits the fan and the
cleric, wizard, mage, druid, etc all announce that *they're* OOM.

Yes, 60% haste, and no attack bonus, single target and a duration of only 16
minutes.

Whereas the level 65 enchanter is casting Valons Quickening,  Increase
Attack Speed by 68%, Increase ATK by 41, Increase DEX by 33, Increase AGI by
52,  Group spell, duration of 42 minutes.

Narrow it down as much as you want.  I still think either you're insane with
class jealousy, or you're smoking the good stuff.

For our normal experience groups, the shaman was optional.  The enchanter
was mandatory.   But then, sitting single pulling in Dreadlands was never
our style.

Strongest class is very relative, and changes in any situation.
