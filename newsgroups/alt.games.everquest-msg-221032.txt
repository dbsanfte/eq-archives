I've been told that people in fact can move a character to another server,
with all equipment, by first moving to the Legends server, and then asking
to move "back" to the new server.  The GMs are supposed to check where you
came from and only allow you to move back to that server, but the claim is
that they don't check, so that you can actually use this mechanism to move.

Does anyone know if this is correct?
