Yep, worked great, very handy.  A couple times last night the
combination of the new pet health display and this ability to
quickly target pets allowed me to save pets that would otherwise
have died, and in at least one instance saved us from a probable
wipe, as the pet was a chanter pet off tanking an unmezzable
mob.  Previously I wouldn't have even noticed the pet being
near death, and I didn't have the pets name hotkeyed because
I generally ignore chanter pets as part of the tactical unit, they
only exist to help chanters survive...

Hmm, that little green bar is moving down fast.  f4 f4 remedy
/g whats up with your pet? /g oooh Divine Light /g switch targets?
