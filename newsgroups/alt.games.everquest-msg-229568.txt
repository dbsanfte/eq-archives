Ummm... Did you somehow miss what happened in EQ the last few weeks?
10k of plat 3 months ago are still 10k plat now, however they wouldn't
nearly buy you the same gear. At least on my server (Karana) prices
have just about trippled for high end gear, and there is barely
anything even available in the Bazaar.

Granted, in theory you are right about keeping the plat (If you leave
for an extended period.. at least a year or two), however these
exploits to creep up and when they do, plat devaluates tremendously.

I'd say hold on to your nicer items, especially the way the EQ economy
is going right now.
