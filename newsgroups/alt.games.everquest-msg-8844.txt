..im been looking into buying one of these..but i have a few questions i want
to confirm...1) does the haste proc.or is it constant......also if my weapon is
43 delay would the fbss make it like 35 delay?...2) can you stack haste..i.e
mithril 2 hander with fbss.....okok last one my weapon is 43 delay..and i was
grouped with a guy using a fbss and a weighted axe..150 delay...and it seemed
like he was hitting as much as i was..is that delay bugged?..thanks
