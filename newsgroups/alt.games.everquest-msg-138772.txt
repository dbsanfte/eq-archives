How are you connecting to the internet?  What brand and model modem or
network card are you using?  What version of Windows are you running?

Go to http://www.simmtester.com/ and download DocMemory RAM diagnostics.
Make sure it detects the correct amount of memory, and let it run it's test.
If that finds nothing, start by narrowing down software problems, make sure
you are running the latest version of all the software on your system.
Update your BIOS, install all the applicable updates from Windows Update,
install the latest video drivers from nVidia (not from Windows Update or
Leadtek), install the latest chipset drivers from AMD and VIA.  Try the
version of the Sound Blaster Live! drivers that ship with Windows or from
Windows Update if you're using the latest from Creative Labs, or try the
latest drivers from Creative Labs if you've been using the ones from
Windows.  If none of that helps, start narrowing down hardware.  One at a
time, switch parts from one computer to the other, start with the video
card, then the sound card, then the memory, then the processor.  Remove any
other devices you don't need to test the game.  If all that fails, there's
not much else it could be other than the motherboard or the power supply.
