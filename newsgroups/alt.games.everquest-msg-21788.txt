}I'm thinking of working on my highpass faction (a dark elf necro needs a

}or should I just sit and feed a fair share of critters to my pet?

I'd actually go with the latter course.  I go through there a lot at 3AM 
when nobody's there, though. :) That way, you can also collect the orc 
scalps that drop occasionally and give them to the guard captain for even 
more faction.

}The goal is to get to the point I can bank safely in the keep. Is that a
}realistic goal and would I be better off using either tactic against the
}pickclaws in the keep?

Similarly, gnolls... I'd love to know which mob gives the biggest faction 
hit of the three, or which quest (orc scalp, gnoll scalp, pickclaw ear).
