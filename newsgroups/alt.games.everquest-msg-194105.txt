You can start on your Prayer shawl quest=)

It will take a long time to get. This way you can work on it some and when
you get bored with it (or run out of funds lol) you can go back to leveling.

Other then that, there are THOUSANDS of quests out there for you to do.. you
are in the mid 40's so there should be a few that you can start on and solo

You can also start on the shield of bane warding quest.  Awesome item to
get.  You can solo some of it, but will need a group at the end.
go to http://everquest.allakhazam.com for everything on quests=)
have fun!!
