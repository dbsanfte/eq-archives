Now THAT deserves a bloody AMEN!!!!!

That is reality. You make the shareholders money, and you are in.
These people who are execs don't appear out of thin air, they spent
their 20s, 30s, 40s, and some of the 50s working hard, making money
for the company, and NOW they get to prove they can continue to make
more money for the shareholders.

The fraternity they belong to is hard work and VALUE. Wanna join?

The only place you can rise to the top, and be lazy and incompetent,
is in Government. The exception that makes the rule is Clarence
Thomas.

Nuff said.
