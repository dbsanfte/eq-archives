That isn't always a good idea.

Hiding at the zone line may give you a quick escape, but it also funnels all
the trains on one person, YOU.

I learned this the hard way via the factionally broken dorf in Xorbb (Yes
Bizbee you were gruff, to say the least, but you did have a point; play on
the tracks and sooner or later you get hit)  Thank god they fixed him
though... (the dorf, not Bizbee)
