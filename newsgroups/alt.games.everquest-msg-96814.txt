As I was reading the post on Casters, I was thinking ... medding without the
book for all my casters.  YAY! :-)

Then as I read the rest of it I started thinking ... I wonder if this could
be a setup.

No hells.  They said it wasn't plausible.  Yet it's obviously been done

I wonder if in 6 - 9 months or so the 60 wall could come down.  Hmmmmm .....

Just thinking out loud.
