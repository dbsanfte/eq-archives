    It has to be more than that. I've grouped a lot in Velk's with a 59
rogue and a (now) 59 WAR. At all times I grouped with them over the past few
weeks, the warrior was blue to the rogue. Warrior uses a Twisted Steel
Bastard Sword (slow two hander), rogue uses Seb Croaking Dirk main /
Ragebringer off (his "I like tanking" combo). It's very rare that the rogue
can take aggro from the warrior. Whereas with any other tank I've seen,
including the standard dual Lammy warriors, the rogue IS the tank for half
of the fight. The only difference there is damage. Obviously there's a big
difference between that warrior's weapon and the average SK two hander,
but....

    How fast does taunt cycle? How fast does Disease Cloud cycle? Which of
the two ALWAYS increases total hate? If the mob stays on the rogue after you
taunt, as a warrior what do you do? As a SK, what do you do?

    The well-equipped ones, ayup. The average warriors on my server have
Lammys and Jarsath Tridents and the odd Jade Mace. Some have one Bloodpoint,
which does proc. Meanwhile, no matter what the SKs are using (and most on my
server at the same equipment level have either a MoSS or a "freebie" Sword
of Pain) they have a proc.

    I'm not saying that the class that holds aggro best isn't the warrior -
once they have it, they *usually* can keep it. But in my experiences, the
class that can best GAIN aggro is the shadow knight - and as a post-50
player of a rogue, I know all about who has and hasn't saved me from a
pounding when Evade fails.
