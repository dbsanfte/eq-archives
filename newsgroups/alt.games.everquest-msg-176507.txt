Thanks. The more I think about it though, I've decided to go with a
shadowknight for the following reasons, in no particular order:

1. I picked the most faction-hampered race anyway in Iksar, so why
not?

2. Honestly, I don't see myself making it to the endgame. If I do,
I'll play SA if I can't MA it. :)

3. I also just can't get used to the idea of having no recourse
whatsoever when the stuff hits the fan. With a SK I have options.

4. I can see where the 50s might be a rough period for a warrior -
tough to find groups sometimes with SKs and Paladins tanking
adequately while adding utility spells and the inability to solo in
this situation.

5. With the xp penalty of the Iksar SK, #4 above is compounded.

Wish me luck!  :)
