I have a really rocking story about grouping with a chanter in the fort. I
was playing my 29 warrior being pl'ed by my 55 druid (Yeah I'm a twink)
anyway, I had a chanter come up and ask me if i wanted to partner with him.
I thought about it and said sure (who wouldnt turn down speed slow etc) and
I constant pulled while the chanter sped me slowed mob occasionally and
mezzed more than 2 adds and ML'ed it was really good experience for both of
us it was a shame when I hit 30 and there were starting to get light blues
partnering with a chanter is great (providing the chanter knows what there
doing)
and I'm out as I can see I'm rambling
