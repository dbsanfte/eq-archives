staying in Kithicor Forest any longer than I have too.  Also, the same
question for the Diary that spawns there too.

I ran through Kithicor forest today and picked up both of them no problem.
Game time was about 8 am.  One of my friends told me that the best time to
go get the diary is early in the morning.  I went in at 7 and by the time i
got to the diary it was 8.  Nope problem getting the ingot.  Just had to
figure out to get on the stump.
