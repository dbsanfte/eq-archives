After reading that a starting troll shaman of inny  is high enough
faction with
draxiz to turn in the whoopall head, to get the halfling one use mask,
I went and tried it at level one:

"How did someone as inexperienced as you get possession of this? I'll
see it gets to the proper hands." 

That indeed reads more like a "level limit" diss than a "faction"
diss.
So I thought maybe it doesn't work at level one, tried at level two:

"How did someone as inexperienced as you get possession of this? I'll
see it gets to the proper hands." 

I guess I'll wait until 3 and try again. I could have sword I helped a
friend's cleric do this at 5.

So has anyone else done this quest and do you know what level you have
to be for draxiz to give the mask for the head?
