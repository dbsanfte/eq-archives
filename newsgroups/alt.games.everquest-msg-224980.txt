I personally was referring to being told by a GM that mobs could 
literally ignore successful FD.  Not fail to forget about you after, but 
rather keep beating on you even though you are lying on the ground and 
did NOT get a "lying on the ground" message.

Now I'm not familiar with that, haven't heard that from players, but I 
did see this happen with those hill giants that one day, was so shocked 
we petitioned, and happened to actually get a GM who showed up... and 
very likely spewed incorrect  information, which is about what you'd 
expect from a SOE employee, they really don't seem to know much about 
the game at all.  Back then there was no AGE channel or I'd not have 
bothered with the GM at all.

I suspect it was a bug, as there'd been a recent patch and there was 
another shortly thereafter, FD was probably screwed up that day... but 
it sure was screwed up at that point and we got that result at least 4 
times.

Splendid
