Well, if your groupmate is porting someplace you don't want to go (and using
a portal rather than a solo port), you should really disband. Port spells
have a pretty long range unless they reduced it - I've been ported out by a
druid when I was standing a good ways away (100 ft or so I think).

And if a joker deliberately ports you to someplace you didn't ask to, report
them. After all, if someone ported you into the middle of Cazic at low-level
and then left you there you'd report that, wouldn't you?

Adding a confirmation message to port as well as Translocate is not really
necessary, IMO (although I may be biased by the fact that I'm a porter).
There has to be some level of trust in the game, and grouping with someone
supposedly indicates that you trust them at least somewhat. After all, you
don't get confirm messages for, say, Bind or wolf-form (which would make
much more sense as they are more likely to get you killed in certain places
rather than merely inconvenience you).

The translocate line is a very useful set of spells, as you can now port
people out of places without leaving your camp/auction watching/whatever,
but there usefulness is somewhat restricted by the fact you have to be
grouped - what would make more sense is to have the confirmation message but
not have to be grouped, likewise for bind and other useful but potentially
dangerous spells that currently require you to be grouped.
