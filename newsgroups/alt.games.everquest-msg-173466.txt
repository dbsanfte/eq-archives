I thought point systems took care of that because the points get "spent"
when they are used.  As an example:

Player A-Collects about 60pts per week
Player B-Collects about 40pts per week
Player C-Collects about 30pts per week
Player D-Collects about 20pts per week

So let's say the average loot item is 60pts. then each player would have
enough points to buy:

Player A-One item per week
Player B-One item per one and a half weeks
Player C-One every two weeks
Player D-One every 3 weeks.

The player that plays more and participates more gets more which seems fair,
but everyone still has the opportunity to get something.  This is the way it
was explained to me, but I've never actually been in a guild that does this
yet.  Is this how the point systems work? Or am I missing something?
