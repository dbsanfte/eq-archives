Yeah, actually SOE doesn't allow anything. They sent ebay a letter or
something, or called them asking them to remove EQ auctions since the
stuff is their inetellectual property. Ebay said, "ok." SOE did not
stop them, or sue them, they simply asked. 

SOE could ask Yantis to do the same thing, likely getting a "no." 
They'd not threaten  to sue him because:

1) he has money/resources (so can call their bluff)

2) as other people in this thread mention, they stand to lose a
billion times over what they stand to win. If Yantis won, having a
court agree that soe doesn't own character gear but that the player
does, then it would set up rampant item exchanges/lawsuits about
deleted characters and all kinds of stuff.
