Note that that's still a third-hand account, and may have
been misunderstood, garbled, or unintentionally misstated
by Niami after hearing Yakatizma say something a little
different than her version, and/or by the person who was
reporting was Niami had said that Yak had said.  Remember the 
perils of "the telephone game".

I'd add that to the list of probable evidence, but I wouldn't
consider it definitive until Yak states it clearly in
writing in his own words, especially since I know Ogre
and Dwarven smiths with horrifying low INT/WIS who progressed 
speedily through Smithing by virtue of enormous STR.
It seems to add more than just a "bonus", it seems to be
a perfectly good substitute for INT/WIS when it comes
to Smithing.
