Disc 2 has the following videos:

"I'm Just A Bill" by Deluxx Folk Implosion
"Conjunction Junction" by Better Than Ezra
"My Hero, Zero" by Lemonheads
"Electricity, Electricity" by Goodness

Not that I know too much about any of those groups.  I grew up on Three Dog
Night, the Doobies, Eagles, Styx, Boston, etc. :-)
