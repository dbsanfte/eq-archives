depends on what you plan doing ...

if you plan on being a artizan many people will tell you to practace
forristing / mining / fishing and gathering ( in that order ) untill your
ofer 40 skill as the lvl 1 spawns within qeynos / freeport are owercrouded
and you need 40 skill to use the lvl 2 ones

also if you plan on being a artisan .. there are some rare crafting books
that drop within all tier 1 zones .. many people find it easy to stay on the
island till they find all of them

There are even some idiots that refuse to leave the island till they have 2
GP in there bank ....
