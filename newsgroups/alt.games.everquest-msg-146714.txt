Or slightly more ambitious and even more useful, an "out-of-game"
client that lets you do the full range of /tell, /guild, /who,
etc.  And preferably in a text-based client that doesn't require
a game-ready video card (yes, Virginia, people are still often
confined to computers without 3D graphics cards at times).

Occasionally it would be very handy to pop in for a minute
or so and see if you can catch so-and-so online to ask a
question or deliver some info, but you either can't load the
full game from your current location, or don't want to.
