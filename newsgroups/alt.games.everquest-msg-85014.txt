All--

Our guild is gearing up to do Temple of Veeshan's Halls of Testing
area. A fair number of our members have raided there with other
guilds. I haven't (although I hope to have a chance to soon) and, as
guild leader, it behooves me to at least do as much research as I can
to get up to speed on the ins and outs of this raid.

Does anyone know of any good resources where raiding ToV and
specifically HoT are discussed in some detail? Alla'Khazams is more or
less useless in this matter.
