Its not necessarily untrue either though. Few synonyms are completely 
interchangeable. There are nearly always subtle differences in nuance of 
meaning. Advancedment and Complexity usually flow in the same 
direction... but I'll concede: not always.

No argument.

I'll happily concede that sometimes advancedment makes things simpler. 

But that's not usually case, and more often not the simplicty achieved 
is actually result of hiding something even more complex. :)

A new car is simpler to operate than an old one. But it is both vastly 
more complex and advanced under the hood.

This applies to EQ2/WoW they are both more complicated games than EQ1. 
And they are both easier to use.
