Aye, I am slowly doing that now, Im thinking of training in sme 1HB
actions as there are some nice ones out there as well.

Keeping aggro has never been a problem (max taunt + some crits from wurmy
seem to do the trick :), but I just wanted to be sure that I wasnt getting
cheated out of some damage here.  Do you think it would be wise to see if
I could trade my wurmy in for a lower damage/faster attack weapon like a
centi LS(14/27) or a Heavy Velium Warsword (12/23)?  Both have decent DPS
and are quite faster than Wurmy, but will lack in that extra punch.
