Yep yep, between libraries and secondhand book stores I don't spend quite this large a
fortune.. but if I didn't entertain myself in any way other than reading, I'd soon exhaust
the local library's supply of books I'm vaguely interested in reading.  As it stands, I split
my reading between library, secondhand books, and paperbacks out of the big chain stores and
try to avoid hardcovers (sadly, I can't resist a new Tom Clancy or Stephen King...) and
rereading some real classics (Heinlein mostly)

Its not the game, its the lack of a dedicated group of players.  I've given up, stopped
buying board games and pnpRPGs entirely, I do play a good deal of chess and Sorry and so
forth with the kids, but they aren't ready for "real" games yet.  MMOG's seem like the way to
go, but I got seriously into EQ and didnt' really give NWN a fair try I think, it was of
limited scope in terms of the single player amature made modules I tried, never ended up
going multiplayer with it.
