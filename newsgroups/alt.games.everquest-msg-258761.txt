You never lose any AA exp or any AA, although if you lose a level that 
was required to buy a given AA you won't be able to benefit from that AA 
till you regain the level.

When you get a rez, all the exp restored to you goes back to your "real" 
exp bar as well, even if you thought you'd like to go ahead and dump 
some deaths and put 96% of the exp into an AA for some reason.

Many people put 90% exp into AA instead of 100%, in order to make up for 
deaths.  A more common practice, however, is simply to build a "cushion" 
of about 2 blue bubbles into your next level before switching to AA, if 
you switch back and forth.
