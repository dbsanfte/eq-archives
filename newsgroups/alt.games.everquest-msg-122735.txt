I have Luclin, but spend very little time there except in the bazaar,
shadowhaven, and nexus.  I'm looking, at some point soon, to acquire a
whole bunch of stacks of Centi meat for baking purposes.  Where's my
best bet for this, which zone/creatures, and anything that a 44/45
wizard will get xp off?
