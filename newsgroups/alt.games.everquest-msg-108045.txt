    Did you ever use that clickable effect outside of PLing folks and
buffing folks who asked for a res? Which do you think will save your life
more: 2 AC or 35 HPs? The WIS comes on everything we own, sadly (I'd much
prefer MANA), but it's still some pool over Donal's. What would you rather
have on your arms? You might be surprised how small that list of
alternatives is.

     Try to avoid the "all or nothing" mentality when looking at an item.
Does that mean you'd also not want gloves with 25 HPs because that's low? Or
a bracer with 35 HPs? Or... you eventually look at the combined effect of
everything you didn't want, and cringe at how much it would have improved
you. Last night, after getting my first ever NToV drop, I just made it over
4 K HPs with full raid buffs and Focus clicked off in favour of Blessed
Armor of the Risen. When you have HPs like that you can eat two consecutive
mod rods (1320 mana gained) and take an AoE and still not be in range of low
health aggro. That's huge. Between my ability to eat rods almost at will and
Spell Casting Mastery 1 my mana pool (just below 3300 MANA before C3, low by
guild standards) lasts a lot longer than that of the more delicate clerics
on the raid.

    All the Thurg quest armor boosts your HPs, pretty much. I have Thurg
legs, arms, gloves, and a bracer, and I like them all. (Guild is Kael
faction, nominally, but I'm about as close to max scowls with Zek, Rif, CoV,
Tormax, and Yelinak as one can get at the same time. No quest armor upgrades
for me!) And if you ever want to see how good those legs are, go to
Allakhazam's and make a list of legs that are better for a cleric. It's a
very short list.
