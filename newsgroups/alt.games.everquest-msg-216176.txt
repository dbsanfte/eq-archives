    I don't think it's really relevant since DS's aren't especially useful
for a duo who uses slow and has good avoidance, but banshee aura stacks with
the DS on our self buffs, cloak of the akheva and cloak of luclin, resulting
in a DS of 17 or 22.

    However, I almost never use banshee aura as its duration is so brief
(like most DS's) that you're forced to waste a spell gem on it. So at the
moment I've got a DS of 5 on me 24/7, which will jump to 10 when I gain a
couple of levels. Anal retentive point it may be, but compared to most other
classes that a shammy might duo with, that isn't really "lacking in DS" ;)

cheers,
James
