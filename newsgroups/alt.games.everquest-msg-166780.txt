Max of 19 people in there last night, and the Pally says that's pretty 
typical these days.  Our 60 Ranger has had the whole zone to himself a 
couple times recently.

I don't do crowded dungeons.  When my old group with my warrior was in 
Dalnir, it was usually just us in there.  Loved it.  Same group was in 
Kaesora for some levels and only saw other people once the whole time, and 
it was a Guild mini-raid ( where we ended up rezzing the GL ).

>too few spawns, and too much contention for them.

If we have a full group again and have the powah, the Pally and Ranger want 
to go do "UD", whatever that is.  Apparently we wouldn't have been able to 
handle it last night with the one cleric logging soon after getting there 
and the Pally leaving not too awful long after.  DRD, CLC, ENC, and RNG 
just couldn't do it.  Especially when the lowest mob ( I think ) is 45 and 
I'm the 47 ENC that gets tons of resists, even after my 44 Tash.  Luckily, 
everyone there is a real good player and understand root-parking as an 
option when needed.

>If you need threads for the shawl quest, just OOC for them from time to

There was one guy just sitting at the zone doing this last night, so we 
didn't hone in on his niche, since we were getting some that drop.  After 
the Druid gets his, I'll start collecting mine, and if no one else is 
OOCing, I'll be doing it, for sure.
