A spell haste item that you can buy unfortunately isn't going to help a
heck of a lot either. Spell haste is 15%, though combined with the
cleric buff I guess 25% would help a bit. 5 sec for malo, 1 sec for the
gems to refresh and then 3.? sec for slow does add up I've found, and
waiting for the tank to build agro too is definately going to cost your
cleric a bit more mana healing. However, malo can't be resisted.

It still takes too long to cast though.
