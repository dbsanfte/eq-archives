I agree with what Graeme said... if you want a group, there are certain
zones you avoid.  I don't know how it is on your server, or if CoB is
the same as ED, but ED is completely empty except for people farming
palladium torques or doing AQ4.  It might be easier to find a group
doing AQ3, help them out, then move on to 4 when it is completed.

There are just certain zones you don't go LFG in and expect an invite
though.  People assume you want to stay in that zone if it is a higher
one than they are currently in.  If you never want to get a group,
throw up LFG while in LS (two people there last night), PF (groups
generally form before making the trek), or ED (bypassed except for
torques or AQ4).
