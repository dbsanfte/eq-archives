#3 isn't much bettter.... it just leads characters to making an 
edumacated guess as to which is better vs not knowing at all. And 
leading the playerbase to make a suboptimal choice simply because 
they're ignorant of the way things work, and logic is unreliable as a 
guide where facts are sparse because ultimately the gamesystem is 
entirely arbitrary.

I prefer #2. Let the min-maxers have their fun. What's the real harm in 
it? On some level an experieced fighter would instintively know whether 
or not they'd be more effective with a different weapon. As far as 
computing the optimum choice for every situation let them... just make 
damn sure that they can't actually *make* the optimum choice in every 
situation...

1) force them to make tradeoffs...give the good equipment weaknesses... 
ensure they can't be outfitted in, or even carry the situationally best 
equipment for every case. All they can do is think about where there 
going to be going and equip 'relatively well', with a few alternate 
items for particular anticipated encounters.

2) ensure its sufficiently complicated, dynamic, and randomized to 
reduce predicticting the situationally optimal choices to 'best guesses' 
that only pan out 50-70% of them. The rest of the time, hindsight would 
dictate that the mob was 'unusually strong' for his type, and better 
defense would have been more optimal...
