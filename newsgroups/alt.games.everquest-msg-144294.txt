I suspect the problem you had with the translocator is a bug that existed
(still exists?) where hailing an NPC would not work.  You target the NPC,
and hit 'H', and it just says "Hail".  To get him to respond, you could type
"/say Hail, <npcname>", and he will respond as he would when hailed.  Also,
given that you know what the key phrase is to get him to translocate, you
could have just typed it.  The problem she had was that she could not find
the Translocator.  Likely, as I posted earlier, he was swimming just off the
dock, possibly playing with a shark or two.
