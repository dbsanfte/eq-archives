If it's dragons you want, start with Halls of Testing, assuming your people
all have good CoV faction.  The first camp in HoT, the ledge, can be walked
to from the entrance to ToV in perfect safety by people who aren't KOS to
CoV, so when you wipe out while learning dragon tactics, it is an easy
recovery (and if someone jumps the gun and evacs a group too early, and then
the remainder of the raid does not wipe out, it's easy for the evacing group
to get back).
