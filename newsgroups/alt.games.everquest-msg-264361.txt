Koas hasn't twisted your words, he isn't playing semantic games.
What you've written above is clearly insulting and deliberately so.
By denying it, by lying about it, you're only fooling yourself.  You got
a nice little scam going were you can, by insinuation and implication,
insult the people that you argue with as much as you want yet still
remain confidently assured of your moral superiority over everyone else.
That scam might work in your little corner of Usenet, but I suggest you
stop crossposting to comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, lest someone here actually
manage to break through your defences and cause you a moment of doubt.
