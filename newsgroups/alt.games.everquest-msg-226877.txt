IMO 'Points' or 'DKP' is about as far away from Merit (aka 'Officer
Award', 'Loot Council' et al) as you can get.  If you're on a raid and
you get overlooked for 'points' you can correct it, pretty hard to do
it with some intangible merit system.

Usually you'll find points systems are based on raid attendance which
isn't perfect (social inadequates WILL find ways to abuse the system
more often than not to the detriment of the raid and the Guild) but
rather nicely sidesteps the 'having sex/drinking beer in RL with an
Officer (or Officers) tends to get you nice loot' factor.
