Location:     Island with the Seafury cyclops in Ocean of Tears on
Stormhammer.
Chimp:     Full mana, Dead Man Walking, Steelskin, J boot SoWed and no Lich.
Gimp:       Dark blue regular pet, full health and Augmented.
****************************************************

Chimp:    "Hey - these Seafuries <are> wusses, the guys were right"

Gimp:    "Yes Master, I could solo them even......which is just as
well...*coughs*"

Chimp:    "Hail - a Corrupted Cyclops!"

Gimp:      "Err, Master - did you notice that is not a 'Seafury
Cyclops'...Perhaps you should look it up first?..... Please."

Chimp:    "Ah - your just a wuss, it's dark blue just like the regular
Seafuries... Want me to get you a skirt to wear as well?"

*There is a cracking sound as Gimp frowns deeply and stress fractures appear
in his forehead*

Gimp:    "No... *grits teeth*  ..Master."

The Chimp races out, cast Dooming Darkness on the Corrupted Cyclops and
pulls it back to the shoreline where he sends a rather hesitant Gimp into
the fray. There are stifled cries and loud groanings emanating from the
struggle.

Gimp:    "Ewww - I didn't know mobs could do that - and where did that
barrel come from?....hope you have some lube there Gimp ol' boy...."

Chimp casts Invoke Fear and is resisted. The second Fear lands and after
Bonding the first Corrupted a second (WTF?) Corrupted appears out of nowhere
and
pulls a barrel out of his oversize pocket. He grins lecherously, knocks the
Steelskin off the Chimp in a single swipe and starts to unroll a 9ft long
Rough Rider. The
Chimp runs screaming like a girl scout, pausing only long enough to cast
Dooming Darkness ( loosing 300hp+ in the process) on the second Corrupted,
then continues running and screaming in the hope of getting enough of a lead
to be able to memorise Gate.

Gimp:    "Ouch! Now I know why there are so many sailors in this zone...
Ouch!"     * Gimp crumples*

*You are summoned - <<SLAP>>!!!*

Chimp:    "Waaaaaaaaaahh! Mommmeeeeee!!!"

*You are summoned - <<SLAP>>!!!*

Chimp:    "Waaaaaaaaaahh! Dadddeeeeeeee!!!"

*Loading Please wait....*

A Corrupted Cyclops_1:    "You bruck him silly, dae not as much fun when dae
dunt squeel"

A Corrupted Cyclops_2:    "Dun't madder, who wunt yur secundz ennyway"
