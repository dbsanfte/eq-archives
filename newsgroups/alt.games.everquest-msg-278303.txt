And? DAoC and most of the rest of the mmog community is successful and 
profitable with a quarter the number of subscriptions as EQ. Development 
wages are a major expense for mmogs... but its relatively fixed, and 
once the subscriber base meets a critical mass (50k-100k for most titles 
by all reports) the game becomes profitable, and the remaining expenses 
(bandwidth, CS, hardware) scale proportionally. 

I'm quite certain EQ was profitable before the price hike, and am quite 
certain EQ would be profitable even if they hemmoraged another 250k 
players.

It may very well be that EQ is making less money now than it was (indeed 
they -must- be making less, but that's not the same thing as facing 
rising costs.

Ones spouse isn't usually trying to sell you the pants. 

This is more like the thinly veiled ego stroking that you'd get from a 
commission salesperson who wants to make a sale so bad that he'll 
squeeze his customer into pants that don't fit when he's out of stock on 
the size the customer actually needs.

I can live without their "kindness" while they simultaneously pick my 
pocket.

I can't come up with any model for their business that would have 
escalating costs for the ongoing maintenance of EQ1. That makes it 
perfectly appropriate to disbeleive them.

I'd honestly have been more satisfied with no explanation at all. Most 
companies raise their prices over time, few of them see a need to insult 
their customers intelligence while doing it.
