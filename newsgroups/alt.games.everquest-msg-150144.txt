Bard songs do screw up FD somehow, but I think by preventing it
going off, not once the FD is in place.

Its possible that other spells cast on people that hit while they are
trying the FD will also prevent it going off... dunno.

I can say with utter certainty that once someone is successfully FD
lying there on the floor, I can cast any heal I like on them, even
if they are standing at the feet of mobs both they and I are utterly
"can't get any worse" KOS to, without them having FD break or
me getting aggro (assuming I can cast from outside KOS range)

I can also (perhaps a better test) cast a heal on a FD monk who
is KOS to a mob that I"m ally or indiff or whatever to, even though
both he and I are right next to that mob, without the mob batting
an eyelash, without changing his faction reaction to me, without
taking a faction hit when the mob dies.

I strongly suspect that any spell which doesn't cause damage
will be fine, having not played in a PvP environment, I don't have
any idea what would happen to FD if I cast a DD or DOT or
something like that on my FD buddy by mistake.

One thing besides bard songs that I know of that will break (or cause
failure, not sure which) FD are hostile spells where the cast
started before FD.  If the mob is a caster, and began his spell
before the monk dropped to the ground, he doesn't cancel it
or switch targets.  When it goes off (perhaps only if not resisted?)
it breaks the FD effect.  Thus, multiple caster mob pulls are
the most dangerous for a monk.

The spell I've cast most often on FD monks is Remedy, because
although its not large and doesn't have the best HP to Mana
ratio by any means, its range is much better than my other heals
(Ethereal Remedy perhaps has same range, haven't tested yet)
and I have the luxury of time with the monk FD.  Also wear a
Supple Scale Armband when I'm the designated puller healer,
for even more "reach out and touch you" power.
