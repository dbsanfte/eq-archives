Sorry for posting off topic but I know quite a few of you have more exp
doing this than me.

Ok so here's the deal, I have 2 PCs networked via crossover cable sharing a
cable modem via MS ICS.

The first PC is a brand new Dell Dimension 4100. It has two NIC cards
installed, one for the cable modem and one for the network. It runs great
and only has one hard drive so my question really pertains to....

The second PC is an older Micron Millennis XKU. It has one NIC installed to
hook up to the Dell to share the cable modem and for networked gaming. It
has 2 hard drives in it, one older 6.4 Gb drive that came with it initially
and a newer 20GB drive I upgraded it with. Right now they are both on the
primary IDE channel(20GB master, 6.4GB slave) with a CD-RW and an old 100MB
ZIP on the secondary IDE channel.

Is there anything I could do to improve performance both on the network and
hard drive level on this setup?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!
