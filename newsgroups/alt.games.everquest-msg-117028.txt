I don't doubt that that's the "party line" -- either because
it's easier to say so than deal with the exceptions, or because
maybe that's the way it's supposed to work (or what the manual
says).

However, I also remember when they were swearing for years
that pre-level-5 corpses would evaporate after 30 minutes,
but my tests (and the subsequent addition of the visible
corpse timers) revealed that it was actually 30 minutes for
level 1 corpses, and two hours for level 2-5 corpses.  So
I'm always a bit skeptical about the "official" pronouncements.

Yes, but it was a little sketchy, so I wasn't sure exactly
what had been done, when.

Some players are unclear that character select screen time
counts as online time, for example.  I know you've been
around the game long enough to know that, but when I wrote
my reply I hadn't noticed that you were the author (I had
been awake since 10am the previous day, my powers of
observation were on vacation by that point).

Hmm...  Not sure what's going on then.  I've camped to preserve
my rez timer quite a few times in the past few years, and it
has always worked for me.  Maybe it's supposed to keep running
and I've just been lucky -- or it's supposed to stop and you
were unlucky.

The prevalence of "frozen" rez timers on corpses for people
who are offline makes me lean towards the latter, but as
you correctly point out, the GMs contradict it.  Nonetheless, as
a rez-capable class, I make a habit of stopping to /con the
rez timer of most corpses I run across, and to do a "/who all"
for the ones with viable timers to see if the "owner" is
online and might want a rez.  So I examine a lot of corpses
and their rez timers.  And I have yet to discover one where
the person was offline and the timer was still running, nor
one where the timer was frozen and the person was online.
(with the exception of the "exactly three hours" indicator,
which I address in another post in this thread).

If that's a bug, it acts a lot like a feature.

/em boggles and looks confused.


> (why would I sit at the character select screen for three hours?).

Many people do it for the same reason I often do it:  My computer
is slow enough that there's a substantial "login time" for the
game (several minutes).  So to make my entry into the game
faster if I expect to get back into EQ the next time I return
to my computer, I'll sometimes just camp it to the character
select screen and leave it there.  That way the next time I'm
ready to play I just hit the "enter game" button and I'm ready
up and running in only about 30 seconds.

I'm stumped, then.  I've had the opposite results when I've
done the same.
