Thats all true especially with red or orange con, or magic cretures .
But I won so many time with my power about zero. I have like 30-40% of
life and mob about 10%. It kills me much much faster like two three
times faster, Then power slowly coming up, just enough to hit Heal. It
restores health a little bit like +20%. But winning such battle much
more fun. It is pure gambling.

I guess best weapon for shaman slow(like 4 sec, I have one with about
24 max hit) and two-handed, no shield, then you can hit really good
(18-20), cast spell, there is no pose between spell and second hit.
While you cast, your hummer is getting ready for next hit.

Usually I keep contagious and ward active, then repeat
heroic-graywind-smite with pose to allow on hummer hit. It works very
well.
