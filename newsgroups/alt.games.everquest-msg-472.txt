As Clinton says I feel your pain. Going on business trips, flying home
alone late at night on planes that seems to defy physics to fly. Buying
cars that drop 3 grand as soon as the key hits the ignition. Endless
home improvement projects. The American dream is to own your own
home until you meet the nightmare of home upkeep. =)
