It's kind of comical sometimes, everyone in the LDoN is moving together, 
and yet it's always the same single person that seems to get hit by the 
traps.

Similarly, in Grieg's End, we will have a raid force there, noone 
sitting, and a mob is pulled to the raid, and instantly runs up and 
smacks the same specific person somewhere in the middle of back of the 
raid, despite said person not having cast any spells, sent in a pet, or 
done anything different from most of the rest of the raid.  I got to be 
the designated target in GE one time, other times it was someone else.  
We never could figure out any rhyme or reason to it.
