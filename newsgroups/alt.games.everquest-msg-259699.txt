Larry is absolutely right on this, Sir G.

Your character's other hotkeys (and abilities) will be out of commission for
the duration of that triple-bash sequence. No taunt, no kick, no slam, no
backstab, no pickpocket, no intimidation, no disarm, no sense traps
whatsoever until the whole thing has run its cycle...

However, you could combine a couple of abilities in a hotkey. For example,
for a rogue I had a lot of fun with, I made a couple of hotkeys that went
something like this:

/attack off
/pause 5, /'pickpocket'
/attack on
/pause 5, /'sense traps'
/'disarm'

I'd hit my /'backstab' hotkey then the multi-ability one. I t had time to
cycle throught the abilities before my /backstab hotkey refreshed and my
skills were always maxed. Mind you, as a rogue, I usually asked up front to
ML so I could shamelessly work on my pickpocket ability and still be able to
share the spoils of our hunt with other group members. More often than not,
people appreciated my being up front about it and let me go for it. (Note:
dropped the idea of working on Intimidation as it seemed to only work at the
worst possible moments or when a mob wasn't snared, hehe)

Also, during those frequent non-combat moments, I used to have my toons work
on sense heading, foraging and whatever with that very kind of hotkey.

/do sense heading ability number
/pause 30, /do sense heading ability number
/pause 30, /do sense heading ability number
/pause 30, /do sense heading ability number
/do sense heading ability number

Skill ups just flew, but Foraging was a tad longer mind you.

Be safe and have fun!
