Don't do Kith Forest at night.  Go between 8 AM and 6 PM (game time).
When I was young I put my "good" armor in the bank and put on my "junk" armor
and weapon to make long journeys, (even a rusty sword is better than no sword. 
You hate to get killed by a greenie because you had NO weapon with which to
fight).
