 Ever run out of bat wings? Ever low on bat wings and didn't want to go
all the way to EC to get some more? Ok, maybe you haven't but I'm sure a
lot of others have. For those that want it, this is a nice spell. Those
who don't want it can stick with carrying around bat wings.

 But yeah, The Deep is what I heard too. Off the same mob who drops the
Pally/SK shield if I remember right.
