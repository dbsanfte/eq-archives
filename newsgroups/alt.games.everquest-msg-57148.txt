Haste won't stack with the enchanter haste.
Mana song won't be as critical since you have a fairly efficient class
make up.
Resist buffs, you're level 35ish, what the hell are you fighting that
requires high resists?
Damage shields will be largely meaningless with 1) enchanter slows and
2) high melee damage as things will just drop too fast to make it
useful--although, let the druid think he's doing something other than
porting, sowing and snaring shit.
