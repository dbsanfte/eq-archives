Nice idea,but its not going far enough.
Remove all PoK books except one on any continent,probably
its too late to do something about PoP,thats the expansion
which feels most like a video game with all this funny stuff
to click on to enter a zone instead of a "real" zoneline.

Even the old world zone lines need improvement in the sense
to make EQ feel more like a world,why are most of them small,
long corridors and not like the zone line between WK/NK?

My personal preference would be get rid of PoK books 
completly and improve traveling by ship,nothing wrong
with waiting for the ship to arrive,nice occasion to chat
with other players.
Allow spell casting on ships.
Add some pirates who occasionely appear.
Add some gambling facilities on ships.
Add tradeskill vendors and tools on ship. 
Adjust ship routes so that they are close to interesting
islands with varying spawns announced by zonewide messages.
Make fishing more valuable on high seas than in the PoK pool.  :)
I am sure,others can come up with more and better ideas.

One can always dream.  :)
