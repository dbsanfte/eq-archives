Lost the plot?

Perhaps so, conversations do tend to slide.

Lets roll back the tape.

OP: list of class ratings for discussion

My first response: Discussion of his ratings

My second response (to my first one): observation that he left out BL, and my
rating for BL.

Kosh response to that: more BL notes, including comment on desirability in
groups due to purity

My reply to that: Yes, Purity gets BL in, but then they see how they shine
otherwise, and would want one Purity or no.

This seems to me a logical progression indeed.

Perhaps I don't understand what you meant by "lost the plot"
