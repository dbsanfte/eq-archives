[other good advice snipped]

I have a related question: I too am thinking of making some backpacks,
especially since I'm at the point where they're good for skilling up
tailoring for a little while at least.  But I'm a halfling druid (no
snide remarks, please!) and have noticed that most bears con amiable
to me, so I've hesitated to hunt them lest I do irreparable damage to
some faction I'll care about later.

Should I be worried about killing bears?  What about wolves and other
pelt-laden animals?
