Right. As they were monkeying around with the halloween script, most
likely.

However that's Sleeper's Tomb, which is supposed to be like that.
Cazic Thule is never supposed to change. There shouldn't even be a
'switch' now.

It's worth mentioning that it was pretty lucky this was caught at all.
CT is not a popular zone on Test and it could conceivably go days
without a visitor (however that is a pre-OoW observation, if someone's
new epic involves it, that would be different).
