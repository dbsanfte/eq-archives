Saw a LD druid run away once from a giant in FM.

Again, only heard of it, never seen it myself. Seen a druid start meeleeing a giant
and dying by it when LD, guess EQ thought it was the correct thing to do.

Nope, but life isnt always fair, neither is EQ. Never died due to LD, but died 3 times
due to some WIERD problem where a sow'ed druid (wieght 65/85, so not in any way
encumbered. No bad spells on me either) could not outrun outsowed mobs. Been killed by
a giant in GD, Cougars in IC (bad pull, got 2 adds and snare failed on the first one.
I ran a little to get away from them, didnt have time to cast a fear spell, tried that
2 more times, still no luck. Then tried running for a full min before stopping, died 3
sec later when all 3 was beating on me).

But LD have its positive sides too, the goblin incident i mentioned in the post
happened around 2 sec after we decided to zone because we were getting killed, then my
warrior beat up 3 mobs while LD, and still have 50% health when coming back.
