I understand your point, although I would argue that Paladins are the ones
most affected by this, as some guilds will accept every other class except
Paladins.  And most high level Paladins have said that they have found that
it is the case that they are generally last in line when it comes to raid
choice.  That has to say something.  Basically the reason is this - Paladins
have no defining class skill that is useful.

Yeah, maybe Druids and Necros in particular get in our our problem too.  But
what this really says about Verant's high end game design and class
balancing is not that good.  I don't really care if other classes have to
get an enhancement as well to make them more viable at raids.   It should be
that every class due to the inherent ability belonging to that class should
be able to have an equal chance at being picked for a raid.  Representing my
class I am calling for one for Paladins.
