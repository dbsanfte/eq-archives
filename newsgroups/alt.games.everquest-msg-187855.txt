You don't really need huge money.  I've kept myself in level-appropriate 
gear and bandages by using the Bazaar on Luclin.  The biggest thing I sell 
are spiderling and spider silks, for around 2-3p and 4-5p ea, respectively.  
I've also made a fair amount of money selling N-quality animal pelts 
(anything above ruined).  Bone chips go for 4-5g ea, and can make a little 
money too.

Just doing that with the stuff you're leveling up on now (with maybe an 
occasional farming run around newbie vendors...buy silks, they'll make you 
a profit...and killing green spiderlings and spiders) will make you 300-
500p over your next ten levels.  That's plenty to put you in spells and 
gear for a long time.  Once you get up far enough, the stuff you loot will 
start being worth real money.
