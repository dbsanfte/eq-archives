The generally accepted rule is that you always have a 5% chance of success,
and a 5% chance of failure, regardless of skill level.  On EQTraders there
are also forumals for calculating your expected success rate based on your
skill level and the trivial level of the item you are attempting.  Some
items also have a minimum skill level required before you can even try to
combine them.
