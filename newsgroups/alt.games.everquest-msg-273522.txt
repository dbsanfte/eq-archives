I started playing EQ right when kunark came out (good times)

I quit right before luclin (good call ;) )

I rejoined after getting a hand me down character around after Legacy I
think it was. (pissed at PoP killing the overall fun of the game)

And quit after LDoN (LDoN lasted for like..  2 weeks)

And now i'm about to resignup, getting another handme down (52 bst
stripped =/)
And I'm wondering what is new in the newest exp's after LDoN?

And i'm not a newbish ebay player, I know What i'm doing. It is just
when i first jump into the game with like 50 exp's I get kinda confused
