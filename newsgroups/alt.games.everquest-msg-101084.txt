Well, I have multiple armour sets... AC , HP, Resists, Fashion ;)

This is the visible portion of the fashion set, for use in lucin
graphics, female half elf, red semi-bobbed hair, short, straight:

Shissir Scale helm (no graphic)
Dark Masters BP/PSC
Crystal Chitin arms
Icy Shackle
Crystal chitin gauntlets
Matchless Dragonhide leggings 
Crystal chitin boots
Swiftwind/Earthcaller (crackly blades)

It looks like a deep golden or highly polished bronze plate set with inlaid
blue enamel and green gems and ornate carved romanesque eagle motifs on the
arms chest and boots, with dark blue chain legs

When I'm feeling floozyish then I'll use a revultant whip, fayguard parrying
dagger and kromrif military leggings with a blackened alloy BP and arms 
from my CR kit, but I'm not telling you what that looks like ;) You'll have to
go find out yourself.

Oh, also: Effects much enhanced by /dopropertinting, if it works for you ;)
