Well, this is has little relationship to this post, but it reminded me of a
funny story for some reason.. Alright, my 5 year old cousin was watching me
play EQ. I'm running along and we pass a dead body. She says "Why is he
lying down?" Then I say "Oh, he died and that's his body." "He died?" "Yep."

And she says "Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
