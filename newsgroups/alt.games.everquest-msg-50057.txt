1) Zone into CB and exit the tunnel
2) Turn left and head toward the bridge
3) Hug the wall to the left of the bridge until you get to the moat
4) You'll see a small ledge right over the moat. Make the short hop onto the
ledge and start fishing and watching the world go by.

I've been doing this since 11 or 12. The pawns and cents that spawn by that
bridge never aggroed me.
