Austin Powers has alot to answer for. But i think the gist of the film was that
before cosmetic denttistry hit these shores i.e. the sixties ansd seventies
brits had bad teeth which is unfortunately true, check out david bowies and
mick jaggers gnashers. Im a brit and have a perfectly fine set of white teeth
thanks :P
But then i wouldnt take anything yanks say about us seriously, i mean their
perception comes straight from the movies where we all speak like the queen and
live in sprawling manor houses in the countryside. Laughed my ass off at 3 men
and a little lady.
