I restarted my account for the release of TSS because a new start in the 
serpent spine sounded interesting.  I have a green drakkin rogue named 
Indrik Veneshesson up to 32 now.  It seems difficult to find groups though. 
Mostly I'm soloing (not easy for a rogue) and the largest group I've ever 
had was 3.  Does no one hunt in blightfire moor or surroundings?  I think it 
kind of defeats my idea of a new start if I need to go back to overthere to 
find a group.  If anyone wants to group up I'm on the Saryrn (mithaniel 
marr) server.
