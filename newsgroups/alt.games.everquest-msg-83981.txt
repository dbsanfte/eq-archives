I understand the difference.  So since they are merely guidelines, not
rules, why is everyone getting in such a huff when one guideline is not
followed, but not when a different one is not followed?

Basically you feel that if a name bothers you in game, it is bad, if it
doesn't bother you it is not, regardless of whether or not the guidelines
are followed.  At least that seems to me to be what you are saying.  You
then use the guidelines as the excuse for why a name is bad, when you don't
like the name, but you excuse a different name that clearly violates those
same guidelines, because that name does not bother you.

Did I miss something here?
