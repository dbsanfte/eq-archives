> What is dot and ds

  You'll want to trim quoted material when you're replying to a 
post...that being said, DoT is Damage over Time. DoTs are spells that 
don't do all their damage at once--they do it over a set amount of time.
As for DS, that's Damage Shield. They're pretty much what they sound 
like--spells that put a shield on the target that causes damage to 
anything that hits them. 
  For instance, one of my characters had a damage shield cast on him by a 
friendly mage that caused 20 points of damage to anything that was trying 
to kill him every single time they hit him. Crushbone orcs don't stand up 
well to that kind of thing.
