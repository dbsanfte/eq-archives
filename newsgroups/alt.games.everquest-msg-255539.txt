You get a sense of accomplishment from working in a cubicle? Dreaming 
about a promotion to a cubicle closer to a window? With a sense of 
accomplishment and self betterment that screwed up its no wonder you 
like raiding.

starting on your own? If so you belong in a cubicle... you clearly lack 
any entrepreneurial ability.
