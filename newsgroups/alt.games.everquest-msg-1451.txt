I play a gnome enchanter, and am 32. Not the best starting stats, but gnomes
are cool. I don't think I've ever seen another gnome enchanter.

I put all possible into int, and the rest into cha (I don't know if that's
your combo). I play on rallos, and often play naked. I use a wand of
insidious glamour and a crude stein most of the time, along with a sarnak
ceremonial dagger. I think the wand is like 12 cha and stein is 15 or
something. With the first cha buff I'm at 132, I think, and haven't really
had any problems with mezzes, and usually have plenty of mana.

So really, just have fun. I've gotten plenty of compliments in my groups. It
doesn't matter if you're a gnome. It's really about how you play.
