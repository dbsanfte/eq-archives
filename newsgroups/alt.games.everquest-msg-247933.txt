   I suppose it was, if in your mind the mention of any speculation of a
trangression is an attack, yes.  To me though, there is a difference from
saying "You know, you sound to me like a sock puppet" to saying "You are a
sock puppet."  The first one does invite rebuttal, and the second is much
more of a challenge.  Moreover, the first sentance, in this case, is
actually right.  Val did/does sound like a sock puppet in this thread.  The
second statement, of course, is wrong.

    So, nice to know, I guess, that your mind has collapsed the meanings of
words "insinuate" and "accuse".  For what it's worth, I think you have lots
of company around here.
