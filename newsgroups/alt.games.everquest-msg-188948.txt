uh...yeah I would say that I am a loser, I was a loser in high school, and
have been a loser so far in life, personally if I can make it through life
entirely without committing suicide then I might be nice enough to myself to
say that perhaps I am not a complete loser and that at least I had enough
determination to make it to the end, which I think will be my only claim to
fame in my life and perhaps after I am dead anything I did of an artistic
nature that still survives will suddenly become worth thousands of dollars,
and I will become a famous artist and or scientist after I am dead.

How do I feel about being a loser? All I can say is that there are an awful
lot of people out there who are losers too, although that is never an excuse
for being a loser, as if you try hard enough you can always get what you
want in America.
