Sheesh, over two years playing this game, and I'm going to have to ask a
total new question.

:=(

I have only recently gotten into the habit of carrying around stat
enhancing food and driink. (I have no idea why I waited so long.)
Specifically Halas ten pound pies and Qeynos afternoon tea.

It's not a huge deal if I consume them, since they don't cost that much
in the bazaar, but if I can stretch them out by eating iron rations and
drinking Pings, all the better.

Questions: I know that, if left alone, you consume one food and drink
item every "x" minutes, depending on the size of the meal or drink. If
you consume two of them back to back, do you double "x" until the next
time you would naturally consume the topmost food and/or beverage? If
you continue eating until you get the full message, is "x" even longer?

What *is* the value of x, and what's it's max value?
