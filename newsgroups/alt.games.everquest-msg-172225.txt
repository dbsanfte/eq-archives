Premature postage..

I'll use the burrower in The Deep for my example too...

Sure he drops some fantastic items.. unfortunately he also drops some
absolutely gimp-tastic loots too..

Another thing they share in common is the frequency that they drop the
complete shite, compared to their nice stuff.

FT V robe, "fantastic!" I hear you cry.. well maybe if it had 100 mana, or
even some HP.. we had wizzies in Velk robes turn this thing down - it went
FFA and we finally got a bot to loot it.
Of course thats a 1 off, its normally 2 x the lame ring and nothing else

Sure hes an easy kill, sure he has fantastic loots on his table.. but whats
it count for when 99% of the time he drops total garbage?
