There is apparantly a petition on the official EQ boards for just such a 
thing,
currently SOE's response is that there isn't enough player interest for them
to do so; they admit that they have the capacity, but don't want to 
create a really low population server.

So if you're really into it, you might try searching the web to find 
said petition and joining it.

Someone said its up to 16 pages thus far, again, I haven't looked at it 
myself so I don't know if that means 16 people are interested, or that a 
"page" means a thousand people so this would be the biggest server ever, 
or something in between.

I'd vote for the original trilogy, by the way, include Kunark and 
Velious, otherwise, well honestly its a pretty small world for people 
who know how to play the game, you'd probably beat it in a month (and 
some power gamers will be on who will have it beat in a week)

A smart variation would be for them to run it strictly original for a 
month, add Kunark then, wait another month, then add Velious.

I would, however, be saddened by the absence of Vah Shir (not having 
frogloks wouldn't annoy me much), Beastlords, and Berserkers.
