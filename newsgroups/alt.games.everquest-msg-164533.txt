What exactly has he contributed that's worth anything the past couple
days? Frankly, he's a fucking troll. All he's done is stir up a heated
flamewar by acting like a spoiled child. He's given ZERO useful
information. I've NEVER seen him answer questions. He's an pig-headed
asshole, nothing more. He cries and whines and throws a vulgar temper
tantrum every time things don't go his way. If' that's being a "valued
contributer" to you, then I hope to hell I'm not one.
