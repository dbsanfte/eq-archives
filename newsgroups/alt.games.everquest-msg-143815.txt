I tried the tradeskills news group ,but got no response, so I'm trying
here. And yes I saw the various "Smithing groan" threads, but they
were full of off-topic rants so my eyes glazed over.

Both me and a friend of mine have hit 115 in smithing. I  have
researched all sorts of advancement guides but they all seem to be out
of date.

Does anyone have a simple guide from 115 onwards that is plat
efficient?

My smith is Barbarian.
