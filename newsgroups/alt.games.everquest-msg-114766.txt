I believe that there are no transfers to FV.
Having said that there is also a one character limit on FV.
Since you can only have one character you may as well start a new one.
It should only take a few sessions to get to level 10.

Also not that you can still play on both (or as many as you like)
servers.
I play on Drinal and FV.

I recommend thinking about what class race you really want to be on FV
and then meking a new caracter. You can then switch between Sh and FV
depending on what you are in the mood for. Also if you ask about on SH
(like when you group with people) you may find that other have a
character on FV too. I know I have a lot of friends from Drinal who I
play almost exclusivly with on FV. A nice little raid on the warrens was
most of my Sunday.

HTH,

Jim
