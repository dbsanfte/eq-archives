Snare is a pretty short duration spell, I suspect that it actually -won't-
outlast charm most times.  Now Ensnare would be nice, which is what the Branch
procs, but getting a mob to stand there and let you beat on it till the branch
procs, even with a 280 dex that can take quite a while, and chanters dont' tend
to stand up to a beating all that long, especially since you won't want to slow
your pet.

I partnered for quite a while with a druid using charm and she'd do just this,
ensnare and charm the mob, it was indeed much much safer than partnering with an
enchanter.  I tried it with my shaman and his Clinging Darkness clicky... the
snare would almost always wear off before the charm would, and of course there's
no way to snare a charmed pet.

Hmm, something funny occurs to me, I could keep my charmed pets in constant
state of Stoicism, which has a snare component to it but is marked as
beneficial; sadly it also has a slow component so they would no longer be the
DPS monsters.... plus I can't charm anything higher than 30th level or something
anyway.

I'm not convinced enchanter is a good charm class, lacking ensnare or a way to
run faster than mobs I have watched them eat hot hasted pet death more often
than I care to think.  One possibility might be to use the longest duration Root
you've got and then deliver the mobs to the pet instead of the pet to the mobs.

As a shaman, the second I got a real pet I abandoned charming, a pet I can buff
to the gills and never have to worry about as a potential opponent (unless I'm
fighting Charming mobs that is)?  I'll take that over a charmed mob that will
turn on me and use all my haste against me any day, despite the charmed mobs
having four times the HP and doing twice the damage, not having to worry is
worth the cost.  Is a chanter pet really so hard to work with, or is it just so
wimpy its not worth using?  I can see now I'm going to have to start a chanter
of my own.
