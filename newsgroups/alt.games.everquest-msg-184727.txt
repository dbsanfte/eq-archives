This is for each USB port, this is normal. It is abnormal to have the ? next
to them, that's bad.

Windows Update is really good, gets most drivers about 80% of the time for
most hardware and 95% for USB stuff. You have a device that's attached, and
windows can't find drivers for it, like a USB modem? In device manager,
elexct Windows update for updating your drivers. Even Win98SE should do that
with aplomb. AND the drivers are WHQL certified.
You might consider a 32bit OS instead of DOS glorified. Win2k and XP are
designed for demanding processes, and hardware issues are dealt with
reasoanbly well without much pain, like having 8 or more devices on IRQ11.

Everquest is a game and application........try the games groups, but once
you got these hardware dramas fixed, the game would work well.
