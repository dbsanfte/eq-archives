No, they won't allow character transfers.   They don't allow transfers
to a new server.   They also don't allow transfers between types of
servers (carebear to PvP or vice versa.)   All the toons on the new
PvP server were created there;  same will be true of the roleplay
server.  That's definite, BTW.

Since there supposedly won't be /occ *at all*, it would be rather
difficult for someone to use for any reason, I'd think.  Some of the
ruleset/changes for the roleplay server I've read:

Good/neutral/evil teams, with no cross-teaming except by neutrals
Common language becomes Human language (meaning it's no longer
    available to every race/character)
Probable removal of dark speech (shared among evil races)
Probable level caps on language skills (so you can't master other languages
    until 20th level -- or even higher, dependent on formula used)
One character per account
No /occ
/auc only working in city zones and being in language (no common
    tongue, remember)
/shout working like /yell (not being heard across zones)
/em in native language instead of common  (so it can't be used
    as a workaround to the language barrier)
No cross-team guilds
No /anon or /roleplay -- /who defaults to ANON
Trivial Loot Code on for *ALL* zones
No such thing as a "NO-DROP" item -- *all* items can be traded
