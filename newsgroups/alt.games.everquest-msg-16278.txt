Agreed on the tracker part.  That would help ensure that the pulls are BLOOD
red for this damage machine >:->.  I'd go Bard though, and just substitute
him for one of the Rogues.

    You know the trick.  It's Fear Kiting.  Thus _outdoor_ group (only) and
no external snarer for the fearer because the necro can do both easily.  No
real healing is needed so no Cleric as the Rogues can evade if fear wears
off (IF it wears off...Rogues would be fearing as well), regen is available
from Shaman for the "lucky shots" and no need for a "suicide run" with
Divine Aura in open spaces...

    Nah, Bards get track too and their multi-buffs for the melee squad would
be faster, mana-less and would instantly reappear if fighting an AE
dispeller.

    This much defensive power not needed.

    Pffft, Clarity.  Necro's are mana DIETIES, the Shaman can Canna and the
main reason for Shaman is the strong debuffs that would keep the mob from
resisting the necro.
