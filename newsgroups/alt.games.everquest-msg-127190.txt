Let me give you a description of the quest:

REALLY SMEGGING HARD!

Well, so far, anyway.  I've got everything I need except the woven 
spiderling silk, but since spiderlings are nowhere to be found thanks to 
the shiteload of people testing out the new UI, after a few hours of 
playing between GFay and BBM with not one drop at all, I tried to go to 
Freeport.  And of course, as soon as I zoned in, I got booted to the 
desktop, and when I got back in, the boat was JUST zoning back out into 
OOT.  *sigh*  I went back to BBM and hunted some more spiderlings but 
still not one drop.

And that's just ONE piece of the armor.  I haven't seen anybody who's 
managed to get any, and I'm dying to know if the stats make it worth it.

While you're in GFay, smack the whiners for me, will you?

Ryou
