Not sure about the all int casters group, but I can speak from experience
that an all pet group CAN be incredibly effective.  Last night I decided to
give them a try, first go was in BB and the group composition was 2 bst, 2
shaman, mage and necro.  Our mission was to collect 30 vampire fangs.  It
was BY FAR the most effective group i've been in for the BB dungeons.  We
completed the mission in about 37 minutes and cleared the whole dungeon in
about 50.  Was awesome.  At no points were any one in any danger of dying,
or even going below 50% health.  With so much dps, we just zerged every
room.  Then we took the very same group that had just owned BB and brought
it to the NRO dungeon.  Our goal was to kill 52 mobs or something.  Anyways
we got totally owned in this dungeon.  First of all the mobs were hitting
for FAR more damage, they almost all enraged when at low health and because
of the makeup of the dungeon being a series of rooms, as opposed to windy
corridors like bb, every pull was 4 or 5.  We managed to win in overtime but
it was very difficult.  It's still fun though that each of the dungeons has
an ideal "group flavor" to it.  An all pet group will own BB, but get owned
in NRO.  Was great fun when we found a lone mob in BB though, we would sick
the pet stampeded on it and just sit back and laugh.
