Well I am playing both at the moment. Cle 26 & Dru 18.
They are for me at least *very* different chars.

Once my cleric got to about 10th level he *had* to group.
I can't solo my cleric at all. 
I know that it is theoretically possible vs. Undead, but not easy.

My Druid has soloed all the way.
With out a problem.

So if I have time and want to group I play the Cleric.
If I am short on time or want to solo I play the Druid.
I know that Druids can be group healers/buffers, but I do not play my
druid that way, because I have a cleric.

A cleric will always find a group, but you will spend a *lot* of time
medding and you will only rarely get involved with the "cut and thrust"
of fighting.

Druids seem to be the most common chars in the game, but they are good
to learn with.

If this is really you first char I would not worry too much you will
want to try other things out so play one or the other for a few levels
and see what you like. Right now spending 20+ hours OL on a char and
then deleting it sounds like madness, but that can be the reality.

I would recomend trying both.

HTH
