I, too, enjoy, donating buffs sometimes. BUT I always let it be known that I
accept trades &/or donations. We spend pp getting spells, mana casting them
we deserve to be rewarded/paid if we use them on folk outside a guild or
group. Only fair.

Wouldn't see a warrior giving you his armor, would you? Especially if he
spent his hard earned pp on that armor.
