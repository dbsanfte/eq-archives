Like many servers, Xev has a section on their server boards for
ranting.  On our boards it has become a conscious artform.  Quite often
rants are intended to be taken as quasi-jokes, inasmuch as people will
rate them, purposefully try to derail them by talking about cheese, and
the like.  However, it's a very unpredictable place.  Rather like being a
gladiator...one day the crowds adore you, the next they are screaming for
your innards to be used as shoelaces for someone they like better.  And
ANYTHING goes. I mean anything.  You can threaten to rape someone's 5 year
old daughter, and do so with graphic description, as part of your insult,
and it's All Good.  

Problem is, sometimes the rant boards are funny as hell, and the community
of regulars has an odd sort of comraderie that is compelling. Other days
you can find yourself walking away in tears because of some utter jackass
saying nasty shit that would be considered sexual harassment anywhere
else.  Perhaps that's the fun, and the risk...and I cannot keep myself out
of there.  Despite all common sense, logic, and wisdom from my 26 years
spent trying to find enlighenment (ok, i was a weird child...I started
meditating when I was 11, and I was looking for fairies in the woods
before that), I KEEP POSTING.  

The good thing at least is that my guild has a healthy appreciation for
drama and rants. I mean, we're the luggage...we can't be fecking socker
moms, y'know?  I'll be the first to roar in fury if a member cheated or
broke rules, but we'd never ever slap wrists for being feisty.  So at
least I'm not "endangering the guild name".

Does anyone else have this problem, though...not being able to stop
yourself in the cess-pools that are server rant boards?
