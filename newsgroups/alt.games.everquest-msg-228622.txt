Pet Canni has been in since beta.  

Yes it was unintended - however, when mages asked about their
lack of mana regen we were explicitly told to "look to our
pets."

Yes you can get astonishing mana regen - *while you do nothing
else*  No nukes, no pets, nothing.

I don't think it needed fixing, in fact I believe we were balanced
with pet canni taken into consideration.  It'll be interesting
to see where new parses w/o it show mages in the DPS hierarchy.
