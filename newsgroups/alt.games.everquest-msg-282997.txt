Well, if I understand correctly, your characters will each get a share of 
the xp porportionate to their level in the group. For example, on a 
10000xp mob (including all group bonuses - figures rounded):

Level 56 character gets 18% (1800xp)
Level 55 character gets 18% (1800xp)
Level 54 character gets 17% (1700xp)
Level 51 character gets 16% (1600xp)
Level 48 character gets 15% (1500xp)
Level 47 character gete 15% (1500xp)

With the 54+ out, that same 10000xp mob would break down as follows:

Level 51 character gets 35% (3500xp)
Level 48 character gets 33% (3300xp)
Level 47 character gete 32% (3200xp)

So, yeah, those characters would see over twice the xp from the same 
kill, though it may just take them twice as long to do it.

Shouldn't be that big a difference, unless you are *really* slow working 
across characters.

Actually, it might not be too bad in your case. It might serve to close 
the level gap between your various characters a bit. If your 56 shrouds 
down to 50, he would get the equivalent amount of xp from each mob that a  
real level 50 would get. Still, I wouldn't bother with it unless you're 
really concerned with catching up on your lower level characters.

Well, I guess I spoke too soon. :P  In that case, you might consider 
shrouding down to 50 on your top 2 or 3 characters. It will serve to 
catch them up. Choosing to PL them wouldn't be a bad idea either. We're 
only talking about 6 or 8 levels. I guess it would be a matter of 
preference. Me, I would probably shroud.

The xp dispersion proportion would remain the same with reds but the risk 
would increase. A level x mob in zone y will always yield the same amount 
of xp before any non-zem bonuses. I've always been of the understanding 
that as a rule killing blue mobs is the most efficient means of earning 
xp.

Hope this helps and that I'm not completely off base one any of it. 
Someone please correct me if I am.
