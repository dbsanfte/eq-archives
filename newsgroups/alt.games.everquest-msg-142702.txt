The problem is the "value" of the respective epics. The Cleric epic is
INCREDIBLY valuable to any raiding guild. It is a HUGE time saver (and
time is biggest sacrifice players make when raiding). The Druid epic
(Monk and Rogue are also among the easier epics to acquire) is nice
for the individual player, but it does not impact the game nearly as
much.

Verant shot themselves in the foot with the Cleric Epic (much like
with Complete Heal). They added an item to the game that alters the
dynamic of the game. So now they feel forced to limit the number
entering the game-world. One mistake compounding another.
