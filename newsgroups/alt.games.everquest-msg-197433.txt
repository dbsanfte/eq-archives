Because there's already heaps to do in EQ. Because PvP tends
to breed a poisonous environment which inhibits co-operative
play. Because SoE hasn't even come close to being able to balance
classes when they're working together. Because EQ isn't a very
good system for PvP. Because ultimately PvP ends up being boring
and meaningless itself, despire attempts to create a player driven
dynamic.

But most importantly because they already have. Check out guildwar
and the zek's (the sewage catchment system for EQ).
