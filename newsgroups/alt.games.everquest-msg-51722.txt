EQ is easy to learn, and not too difficult to master. All it takes is
a decent memory and some common sense.

>So, if like me you don't know much about EQ at all, and you don't know
>anyone who plays it, how easy is it to start playing and learn the rules?

EQ comes with a quick offline tutorial. Running through the tutorial
will teach you all of the basic commands for movement and using the
enviroment (ie opening doors, talking to NPCs, etc)

>can anyone learn enough to enjoy the game without getting killed repeatedly?

EVERYONE gets killed repeatedly in EQ. Dying is just part of the game.
Fear of death (ie some Experience loss and having to go find and
retrieve your body and gear) is one of the most addicting parts of the
game. It sucks to die, but it is never dull :-).

> is there a monthly bill?

The monthly fee is $9.98USD. You can buy 3 and 6 month blocks of time
for a slightly reduced overall cost.

Buying the "Trilogy" will get you the original game and the two
expansions. (EverQuest, Ruins of Kunark, and Scars of Velious). It is
a great deal if you are a new player. 

Cheers
