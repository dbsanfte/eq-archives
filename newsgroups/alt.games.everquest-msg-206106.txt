This is your way of saying the druid has no heal over times right?
apart from that AA with the long refresh.

No, but i've watched a shaman try and keep a group alive with it.

Sure it does. It's the power behind a shaman's mana regen and it's an
awesome top up heal. It's just not a main heal in PoP.

Sorry, I thought you were comparing them to the druid equivalents
rather than each other. Krag and Tnargs are certainly different
spells. One similarity being they are both inferior, markedly, to
the druid versions.

Nice weapon, some of the elemental drops really are quite sweet. But
the real question is how often it procs. Since the DPS melee and pet
casters are doing 200+DPS at that level your proc represents roughly
two seconds of their damage.

I've been on raids with people I consider extremely skilled shaman.
There are two raid buffs they offer, Fot7 and Boar. I know for a
fact they keep some melee without primals under avatar. I've never
seen them buff Bh'li or Acumen.

With a stamina buff it's inconceivable the character doesn't have
100+ stamina, so stamina regeneration is irrelevant.

I must admit i'm not entirely sure why Bh'li isn't used. It seems
to stack with the ranger and shaman ATK buffs. Perhaps too many
raids are inside or there is some conflict I don't know about.

What the heck, not like there aren't a horde of shaman and enchanters
around so someone is going to cripple it. I would dearly love to see
a parse of substantial damage reduction, it would vindicate the shaman
class a lot.

Although if you want to defend the class, outside of the context
of the original argument, then Malos needs a mention.

Gosh, really. That said if it's going to land fast it's also nice if it
does 2K rather than 500.
