And more importantly, slow causes huge amount of agro as it gets more
powerful (even on a fail). With the pajamas those enchanters insist on
wearing as armour, you really don't want them being beaten on. You on the
other hand, can happily tank away until someone else gets agro.

I always took that to the point of actually slowing and rooting mobs the
enchanter has mezzed - when they wake up, they don't go anywhere, and if
they do, it's after me, not the guy holding a mug (!) as a weapon.
