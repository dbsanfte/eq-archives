Connectivity Issues This Weekend 7/18 - 7/20
07/18/2003 08:22 PM

During this coming weekend, due to the recently announced security
vulnerability in certain routing devices, many ISP's, including ours,
will be conducting emergency maintenance on their network to correct this
issue. This may mean players experiencing brief interruptions in
connectivity to the SOE game service as ISP's across the Internet reboot
their routers to install the fix. We apologize for this unavoidable
inconvenience.
