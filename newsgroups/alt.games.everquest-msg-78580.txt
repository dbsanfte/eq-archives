BlackIce does unfortunately have problems if ports and servers are moved
once they have been allowed trafficking with your computer.
I had to completely uninstall BID after Sony reconfigured the subserver sets
they where using for specific zone servers.
As only disabling it does not actually turn it off, it just lies dormant and
protects some functions anyhow.
And all that i got from the Sony support people, they ran me through the
process, they are well aware of that problem.
The firewall they recomment is Zonealarm, wich i have been using also, and i
love it.
