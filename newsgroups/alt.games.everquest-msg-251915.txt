Ah, so Curses don't include things like Malaise or other
non-damage continuing detrimental effects?  I was hoping
when I got Remove Lesser Curse that it would be useful
against such things.  As it is, it's a real pain when I
get Malaised and I can't fix it with Cancel Magic because
I'd have to eat through (or click off) all my buffs first.

I suppose I could cast some unneeded buff such as Endure
Cold first, then cast my other buffs, then click off the
first one to leave a slot open for detrimental effects so
I can use Cancel Magic.  Heck, maybe I should leave 2-3
slots open this way, to be prepared for Malaise + Root +
DoT.  Is this a "standard" tactic?
