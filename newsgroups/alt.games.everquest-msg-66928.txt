Go look at how many people are playing DAoC on a nightly basis. When the
game was first released, even on day one, there were about 35k people. Now,
in primetime, there are 33k. That's after all the sales records were broken
and it's had a couple of months to grow. It sure doesn't look like it's
growing by leaps and bounds anymore. Yet, in EQ, zones that seemed so empty
right as DAoC opened are now full again. It just looks to me that a lot of
those people who left for DAoC looking for something better are realizing
that EQ is still the best.
