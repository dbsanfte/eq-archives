Ok, I get all embarassed when I have to ask others for tech help.
Hopefully no guildies are lurking here this week...

Recently upgraded my GF2 MX (the original 32mb MX, not 200/400 or
whatever) to a Geforce4 4200 128mb card.

Love it.  REALLY love it, I can have spelleffects back on when just
goofing around again - Wheee!!!  Ok, and the bazaar doesn't bring my
machine to its knees.  That's not a bad thing either.  And the world
just looks better now, darn it.

BUT, every now and then I now get this goofy 'pause' of some sort.
Can't seem to pin it down as to what causes it, but seems that
sometimes running up a slope in Marus Seru will usually make it
happen.  Anywho, the system will appear to lock up for about 1-2
seconds, when it comes back the lag-o-meter shows all red for a very
brief second (VERY brief), then all goes back to normal and
everything's fine until the next time it happens.
Like I said, can't pin the cause down much, but seemed to happen most
often with my Beastlord in Marus, was on as the cleric for quite a bit
and it only happened maybe 2 times.  With the Beastlord happened
almost every 5 minutes.  But once I wasn't the one pulling, it didn't
happen much at all.

So... I'm stumped.  Any thoughts?

The machine is an AMD 900 with 768mb ram, ATA100 drives with tons o
free space.  Have AA turned off (does it make much diff in EQ?)
Running EQ now at High detail, was at low detail before if that
matters.  Texture caching is/was off.  Same issue in Win98se and win2k
(well, except that sound is still /random in win2k, but that's a
different bitch for another day).
