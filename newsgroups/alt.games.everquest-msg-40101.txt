Her home page is one huge cry for attention. And now that she writes
for Voodoo Extreme (the site that gives us more pasty whiteboy
pimp-speak than we really need), it is safe to write her off all

combined. Reading her articles is like watching someone throw up the
two-fingered heavy metal devil salute at a Judas Priest show.
