I disagree. Your conception of 'fair' doesnt come remotely close to
mine. I've read your arguments and can see you're going to continue
to harp on and on about even distribution of platinum meaning 
fairness. Fine. I dont agree. Subjective terms like 'fair' are not
facts, and are trivially disputed.

I view all sorts of other issues - time invested, utility gained,
pleasure provided, effort and resources expended - as equally (or
more) important than 'even distribution of platinum gain amongst the
group at point of random regardless of these factors'. You dont.
Thats cool, and all, but it isnt a 'fact', or even remotely close
to one.

As seen by the people disagreeing with you in this thread. Mere
assertation does not make it so.
