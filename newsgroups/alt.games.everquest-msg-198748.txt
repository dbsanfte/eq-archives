And how would you implement this?  I'm not trying to start a fight or 
anything, just asking.  Seems to me that you would end up having to 
exclude anyone that hasn't played on Test before.  Other than that 
kludge, you'd REALLY have to do some major coding and casue a LONG delay 
while the server queries ALL the  other servers to find out where all you 
chars are, and what their highest obtained levels are...and how to find a 
char you deleted after getting him/her to 30?

Kinda like the needle-in-a-haystack thing.  Kinda.

I think (and have no facts to back this up) that SOE is trying to get 
more people to play on test.

Of course, I could be wrong on all counts.
