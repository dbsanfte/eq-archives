It's quicker to get to Runnyeye via Misty thicket/RV than it is down the EK
ramp and thru the gorge. Maybe he wants to far..I mean hunt ;ï¿½) there

It's also nice to be safe in as many zones as possible and using the goblins
you can gain faction with halfees without losing it with anyone important.
I still prolly have a couple of thousand more runnyeye and picklaw gobbo's
to kill before the little hairy footed ones forget about my "crimes" against
their kinfolk.

On the subject of faction, any ideas how to gain faction with the Indigo
brotherhood if you are KoS to them? My SK is safe thru most of Neriak but
the Warrior and SK guilds are not to happy with him.
