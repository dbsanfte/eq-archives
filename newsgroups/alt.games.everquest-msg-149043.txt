Granted, their response time can be horrible at times (at other times,
it can be fantastic). I never said theirs was GREAT customer service.
Overall, it's not bad either. Yes, there are cases of bad CS, but
there are also plenty of times I hear of good CS experiences. Problem
is, very few people talk about the good unless directly asked,
everyone vents about the bad.

However, the problem was solved eventually. That tells me the "guy
behind the counter" didn't ignore it. He just took his own sweet time
getting to it. >< Considering there's no way of knowing what else was
going on behind the counter, dunno if there was an excuse or not. (And
how do you know that it was "simple to fix"? Finding exactly where
every single one of your factions were at and setting them back
without a rollback of your character might be more trouble than you
assume...)
