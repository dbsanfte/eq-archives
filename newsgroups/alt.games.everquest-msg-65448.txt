EQ:SoL is barely 48 hours old. (Less when you count the delayed launch
and congested patch servers.)

Give Verant a few weeks before you condemn them. Tell your friends to
do the same. 

Verant isn't stupid. EQ is a goldmine, and one of the most popular
games in the world. They screwed up by announcing and then going
through with a "Just in time for Xmas" launch. Obviously EQ:SoL was
not ready for release, but the went ahead anyway.

Just for the sake of argument, let's say 20% of the player base is on
Win95, and another 25% have machines that cannot or will not be
upgraded. Do you really think Verant will leave 45% of the player base
hanging in the breeze? 

My guess is that Verant is already looking into changing EQ:SoL to run
on DX8.0a (the last Win95 compatible version of DX). I find it hard to
believe that DX8.1 is so radically different that they cannot get
EQ:SoL to run without it.

Keep your hopes up, and give them time to address the issues.
