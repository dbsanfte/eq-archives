?  I said that:

1) I do not assume my vehicles are safe when they're locked.
2) This confers no responsibility on me for someone else's actions.

I accept responsibility for locking my vehicle.  I do not accept
responsibility for someone else's actions.  If I *had control* over
that other person, then yes, I would accept responsibility for their
actions.  But in the case we're discussing / arguing I don't have any
control over them and therefore *no*, I will not accept responsibility
for their actions.

Nope.  My buying a car (or a motorcycle, or a house...) does not make
me responsible for someone stealing it or vandalizing it.  Buying a
car makes me responsible for payments, *not* for other people's
actions with regard to that car.

Ungo Box?

So you're saying that if someone breaks into your home, it's *your*
fault?  Blame the victim often, do you?

If someone breaks into my home, NO, it IS NOT my fault.  It is their
fault for breaking in.


>you. You sound like someone that insists that nothing is ever your own
>fault, skating by, blaming everyone else for anything that goes wrong.

Exactly incorrect.

I accept responsibility for my actions, and I accept responsibility
for my inactions. I *do not* and *will not* accept responsibility for
things over which I have no control.

You are a chef.  You have underlings working for you.  You have
authority and control over them, and therefore can (and should) accept
responsibility for their actions.  But you have no authority or
control over the guy outside walking past your restaurant.  Why,
therefore, are you willing to accept responsibility for his actions?

If someone runs in front of my car, they are responsible for their own
death; it isn't my fault (assuming there was no time for me to perform
evasive maneuvers).  If the tie rod goes, and my car swerves onto the 
pavement and someone dies, it IS my fault; I failed to perform
appropriate upkeep on my vehicle.

In the first instance, their actions led to their death; their
responsibility.  In the second instance, my inaction led to their
death; my responsibility.


A couple of quotes:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responsibility *cannot* be shared.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not confuse "duty" with what other people expect of you; they are
utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe to yourself to fulfill
obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail
anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to die.
Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect. 

But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of
you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible. It is
easier to deal with a footpad than it is to deal with a leech who
wants "just a few minutes of your time, please - this won't take
long." Time is your total capital, and the minutes of your life are
painfully few. If you allow yourself to fall into the vice of agreeing
with such requests, they quickly snowball to the point where these
parasites will use up 100 percent of your time - and squawk for more! 

So learn to say No - and to be rude about it when necessary. 

Otherwise you will not have time to carry out your duty, or to do your
own work, and certainly no time for love and happiness. The termites
will nibble away your life and leave none of it for you. 

(This rule does not mean that you must not do a favor for a friend, or
even a stranger. But let the choice be yours. Don't do it because it
is "expected" of you.)
