And I'm sure some people find stealing cars and joyriding them more 
fun/challenging than driving by the highway code. Doesn't mean they should 
be allowed to get away with it. This is not a single-player game where 
cheats only affect your own enjoyment and nobody else's.

Anyway, following the thread backwards, the original posted called EQ a 
hack-and-slash game, and I think Gregg got mixed up with the other meaning 
of hacking... :)
