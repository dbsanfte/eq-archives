115 in baking is good enough to make good profit.  If you are a Human Monk,
just go to East Common and pick up a bunch of Jug O Sauces from Parthar in a
side hutt at Inn1.  Next run to East Freeport and go to the vendor by the
docks that sells fresh fish.  Combine 1 fresh fish and 1 jug o sauces for
fish fillets.  Sell the fish fillets back to the vendor for a profit.
