No, early on, one of my complaints was that all chars no matter what 
race or class had a sameness. If I create an Iksar, no matter what 
level, an Iksar is or at least should be "born" with certain traits, not 
ding 50 and suddenly get those racial traits.

EQLive has nothing to do with this. Racial traits are something a char 
is born with no matter what game. They may go on to develop better 
control of those traits or not, but for them to magically appear at 50 
seems like a foolish proposition in my opinion.

More and more, this feels like a Playstation game, not a MMORG.

I'm also getting more than a little tired of people in general (not you 
in particular) saying EQ II is not EQLive. It is also not WoW, but you 
do need a reference to compare things that you believe work well in one 
but were poorly implemented in another. I have played EQLive for a long 
time. I'm ready to move on and don't want a newer version of the same 
game. What I do want is something that grabs me like EQLive did. EQ II 
is not EQLive, a fact definitely not lost on me as I am so bored with EQ 
II. My main char is now a 21 Wizard and I keep hoping for something to 
change, but it hasn't.

I find there to be little or no strategy involved. My lack of spell 
knowledge, or poor choice of spells cannot affect a battle, because so 
far there are almost no choices to be made. There are so few spells, and 
many of the new ones were very minor upgrades to earlier ones. There is 
a link in a thread on this newsgroup to a very well written critique on 
this from a Druid's point of view. For me, battle amounts to click 1, 
click 2, click 3, rinse and repeat. You know in advance if there will be 
adds. You know if a mob is single pullable. You know if it is an 
undercon. You'd have to be a pretty incompetent player not to be able to 
control the few spells you do get.

However, if you (again, no you in particular) are that incompetent, then 
other EQ II players are going to suffer. They will share in your 
incompetence via the debt they incur. Unless changed, griefers are 
really going to enjoy this aspect of EQ II.

That said, it may be different at higher levels, but I know I'll never 
survive the boredom to find out. I had quit for a few weeks, but went 
back to give it another chance after not playing any games for a few 
weeks, but I can't escape the feeling that this is an expanded console 
game. I don't feel like I'm exploring a world. To me it feels like 
looking over someone else's shoulder who is playing the game. I feel no 
connection to a world whatsoever.

Also, since the recent patch, I am getting kicked to the char selection 
screen quite often. I didn't experience this at all in the previous 
month. It seems to happen most often in Antonica.

I know EQ II is not the game I'm looking for, perhaps Vanguard will be. 
The available information seems quite interesting. Several of the 
original EQLive people are there, but again, I don't want another 
EQLive. If Vanguard turns out not to be of interest, then I think I just 
might abandon online gaming for good. Shhhh, my wife would love that 
info! Perhaps it is just a sign of the times. EQLive came along at just 
the right time. Gamers were ready for it. It was a world early on. It 
was exciting and exploreable with many dangers awaiting you. Maybe that 
happens just once in your gaming lifetime...sure hope not, those were 
the best of times!
