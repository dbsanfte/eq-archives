I know I can't cast IoS or Altuna on low levels (even 20s) w my 64 beast but
my wife has cast them on my 10th level warrior (she is a 65 shammy).
Fromwhat I understand it is the level you get the spells , so for  a beasty
they are harder to cast on low levels because we get the spells much later.
Sorry I don't know the specifics, I tend not to fret over that too much.
