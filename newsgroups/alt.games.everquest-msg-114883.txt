You should be fine. Be sure that you have magic weapons so that you
can hit the wisps (you will need magic boots if the ranger wants to
kick them). Just keep an eye out for adds, and pull to the beach. Use
the druids damage shield. It really helps to wear down the mobs, and
every little bit helps, especially if the Ranger can't kick magical
creatures.

Other dangers (exp) on the island...

1. Madmen (similar to the ones in Oasis. Some cast, but all should be
blue at level 14)..KoS and will agro if you get close to them.
2. Fire Elementals (should be blue at 14. Druid should keep the
Anti-Summoned spell up) KoS and will agro if you get close to them
3. Zombie Sailors (low-mid blue at 14) KoS and will agro if you get
close to them
4. Kerran Beetles....Do NOT kill them!!!! They are sacred to the cats
on the island. If you kill them, you risk agroing all of the cat
people onto you. I also think that killing the beetles spawns the fire
elementals.
5. Kerran Spiders....good exp, but they have a nasty poison. They hit
hard and are social so be careful and single pull. If you hunt them
keep cure poison up and ready. It will take 3 casts to remove it. They
drop silk, but not very often.

Have fun. It is a great tropical vacation spot :-)
