Thanks Bob, I am looking forward to it. You didn;t say anything about
how you feel about the overall performance of your Dell though. I'd
like to hear that.

I just went back and checked. All Dell seems to offer with their
2.4+GHz P4 machines are the RDRAM set-ups.

Is the price more a factor of this being a brand new memory type? I
remember when the DDR memory first came out everybody said the same
thing. Same thing was said when SDRAM was introduced.

I am betting the prices will drop down somewhat in the future. Anyway,
I mave struggled with 256Meg of RAM in this old P3/500 machine for
over 2 years now. And that is the old SDRAM too!

Anything is going to be a speed improvement over this!
