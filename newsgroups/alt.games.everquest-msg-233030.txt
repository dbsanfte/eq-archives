I don't discount what the posts say so readily. In hindsight the
freezes did seem to occur the fastest if I was going from webpage to
webpage. It also explains the fact that EQ had no trouble at all in
running (as a matter of fact someone in one of those threads mentions
that gaming, which is a constant stream, is largely immune to the
freeze). Opposing this, however, was the behavior of the patcher,
which should also have been a constant stream. But I am not the
expert....

Exactly one - the local area connection. I should mention the router
is not connected atm - if it adds anything to any of this its wrong.

If I understand what you are asking for, it was the default
(something.something.1.1)

And this would be something.something.1.100, again default.

Newp. I did a couple times but when they didn't work I put them back.
I also reset the router to default using its own reset.

No.

You'd have to explain how to see that one too but it seems unlikely -
this computer isn't all that old and hasn't been used for anything
beyond regular surfing/filesharing and internet games (mostly EQ of
course).

I am not looking forward to hooking up that mess of a computer to
anything. That might take longer than fixing the router.

IIRC it is virtually always solid or very close to solid "on".
