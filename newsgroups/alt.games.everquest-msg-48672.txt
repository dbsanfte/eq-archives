I called it a nerf, because it is a nerf. This
was confirmed by a 'purple' (Verant) character
who was there at the time. Several popular
newbie quests are currently nerfed. I suppose
the idea is to nerf 'em early, then re-enable
them for the late-comers. At least that's what
happened in beta.

The problem is the people making the perilous
trip as a level 1 get -no- reward for so doing.
What they should have done is nerf Tacar and his
pals.

Luckily I have Selo's now, so it really doesn't
matter.
