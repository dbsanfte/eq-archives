>1. Are the iksar advantages over humans actually worth the 20% experience
>penalty?

Only you can answer that. An Iksar has to earn one more yellow bubble
per level than a human (20% penalty)

>Do iksar have any other advantages?

Iksars have some of the BEST newbie areas in the game. You can easliy
level to 45+ and stay within 2-3 zones of home. The exp is so good
that many Iksar players don't even notice the EXP penalty. When you
hit your 50s though it will hit you like a ton of bricks.

The main disadvantage to being an Iksar (and why I chose Human) is
faction. You will see much less of the world of Norrath as an Iksar,
or you will spend MANY hours farming faction to become non KoS is many
common areas.

Pick the Race that appeals to you the most. Only you can decide what
you like.
