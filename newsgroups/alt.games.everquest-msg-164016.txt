You can have someone in the US buy it, and ship it 2-day shipping for about
15 bucks using FedEx. Why to go through all the trouble of downloading all
that just to save a few bucks or to get PoP sooner.

And there ARE online shops that ship to europe, i have bought many games
from several shops with no problems.
