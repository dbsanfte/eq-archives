Dude, what is your problem? You have no opinion you just continually
bash me over and over for no reason. Please do not reply to one of my
posts again unless you're actually gonna disagree or agree with me. I
mean my god what are you a freaking mental patient that has nothing
left in their syphilis eaten brain except revenge and one sentence
insults? Get a life, then kill yourself.
