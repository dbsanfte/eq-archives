So, though some people may feel the new "group" feature on maps is
too much of a crutch, I don't think anybody will deny that it's
useful.  Well, tonight I discovered another property of it that
makes it even more useful.

When I died, my groupmate's map showed an X marking my corpse.  (It
even said "Terrwini_corpse0" as the name when mousing over the X.)
When I zoned back in, the X for the corpse vanished and an X appeared
at my real loc.

I haven't checked just how versatile this is.  For instance, will it
show the X if my groupmate wasn't in the zone when I died, but zones
in later?  What if we weren't even grouped when I died?  What if I zoned
in and then left again, will the X go back to showing the corpse?

Maybe I'll take a level 1 mule and get him killed a few times for some
experiments.  (I actually have a character named Expermint for this sort
of thing. :-)
