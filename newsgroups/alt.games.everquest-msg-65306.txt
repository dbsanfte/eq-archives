Thanks for the replies, I have a Sound Blaster Audology Sound
Card(Gamer). I also bought a 512MB DDR Ram stick I am waiting to
recive on Ebay. I am currently running Windows me.

When I select the options button it asks me which vidoe card, so I
select my video card, then it asks me language and I select that, then
it returns me to the menu. I am so psyched to see the new EQ, but hope
it isnt as Dark as it was when I logged in, I was so disapointed when
I logged in the first time and so the old GFX, hopefully I can get it
working tonight.
