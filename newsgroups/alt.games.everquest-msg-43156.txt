I actually keep a fixed swap file of 256MB with 256MB of physical RAM, and find
it faster than 512MB virtual memory. I used to go on a policy of 2-2.5x
physical, but after doing some ng reading regarding Win9x and hard RAM of 256MB
or more, I tried out some advice and set it to even and it works really nicely.
