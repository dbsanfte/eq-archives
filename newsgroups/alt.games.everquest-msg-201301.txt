I am getting one, but it will sit in one of my bags with my gauze press, 
bracer of hammerfall, amulet of the grey wastes, and choker of majdd. :) I 
am also beefing up my AA to 6 points to add regen, then I will conentrate 
on leveling to get crits and my new damage bonus at 55.

OK... I had thought this was a nice item, but so many people are telling me 
it sucks, I guess I'll get something else.

It seems my desire for dex was misplaced. I have noticed that with HOS or 
pumpkinhead buff (nights dark terror or something?) I proc a *lot* more, 
but if 15 isn't that big of a difference, hell I'll sell my Cloak of 
Shadows and Executioners Hood.

Cool. Do they summon? I have access to a friends 64 Druid ATM, so...

Yeah, I figured I would never see some of the items I want for sale.

You mean they are fine as they are? I *really* want the Entwood Mace now 
that I have done the math on it ;)

Cloak of Greater Pernicity? That's my first non-haste back choice.

For waist haste I have been eyeballing the spiked seahorse spine belt, too.

Definitely will do :)
