They came up with three systems for recounting the ballots in Florida as
well.  By three of the four sets of standards, Gore won.

If they had not illegally counted invalid absentee ballots (unsigned, mailed
after the due date, etc) Gore would have won.

If Jeb Bush had not illegally barred thousands of people from voting,
primarily blacks and hispanics, Gore would have won.

It makes no difference, Bush is still our president, but by measure after
measure, it's clear that Gore won the election.
