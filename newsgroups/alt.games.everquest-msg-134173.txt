Uh, YEAH :o)

60-70% of your mana is gear generated... especially if you suddenly strip
off all that high level +MANA gear you've accumulated because you hit the
200 or 250 Int/Wis cap a while back.

Base Int = 142 (Erud caster maxxed)
Gear Int = 100ish will put you close to the absolute cap, only need +58 Int
to hit the old 200 cap
Gear Mana = I'd guess you're carrying about 600 extra mana in gear... maybe
more.

With effect gear, FT shawls and various buffs, you can reduce your mana
usage-v-regen rate by about another 20-30%.

I'd be interested to see exactly what you stripped off, just to see how much
a high level Wiz looses :o)

Like the story, too... a nice bit of tension to get the ol' blood pumping
:oD
