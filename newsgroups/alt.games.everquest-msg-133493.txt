AFAIK

AC = Base AC (you class/races base AC based on your Defense skill and
Agility) + (1.5 x AC rating of Item)

When you add a 10AC item your AC goes up by 15, this happens if your Defense
and Agility are both 200 or both 100.
It's your Base AC that makes the big difference,  a 50th Warrior in full
Crafted will have more AC than 5th level warrior in full Cobalt...in fact
the 50th Warrior will have more AC naked than the 5th lvl in Cobalt.

I am certain Buffs add directly to this but have no modifier to them, a 30AC
buff is always a 30ac buff.
