One can only offer anecdotal answers, as the company line is that
something like 30 days after canceling your account, your character is
deleted.  In reality, I canceled my account for about 3 months, only
to return to find my character intact.  Others have gone as long as 6
months or more.  Indeed, I've never actually come across a post
suggesting that a character WAS deleted.  And to do something very
unusual for me, and actually address your full post (lol), i don't
know if any way to check besides actually logging on.
