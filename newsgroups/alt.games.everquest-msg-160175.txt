I feel your pain. My guild on FV recently imploded too, with most of
my friends going to other guilds that I can't join because of my
schedule RL. This leaves me as a level 56 beastlord with no guild, and
no connections to get in a new guild. I still have a guild tag over my
head, but in reality it's a guild of exactly 3 people. So I'm just
kind of drifting at the moment. And I did the exact same thing when
the guild opted to split up. The mischans, I mean. Must be a FV
thing...
