Do you realize how much "MORE" there is going on in EQ than UT? The
zones are several times larger, and the amount of textures required is
larger by several orders of magnitude. (to give only two examples.)

EQ may not be have perfect coding, but you cannot compare EQ's
performance against a FPS like UT. They are apples and anvils.
