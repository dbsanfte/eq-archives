For mass produced items, this is certainly true. If you're going to
make a million of something on an assembly line, you're able to
produce them quite cheaply. By producing so many of them, the
manufacturer can reasonably expect to make back the cost of R&D.

The concept of economies of scale doesn't apply in EQ, though. This is
much more a situation like that of a skilled craftsman making custom
items, one at a time. If you buy a piece of hand-crafted custom made
furniture, I doubt you seriously expect to pay no more than the cost
of a few planks of lumber for it!
