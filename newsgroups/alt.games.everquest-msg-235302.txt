In mid December '03 my computer got infect by a trojan virus that NAV didn't
detect and it subsequently corrupted some of my operating system files. As a
result I had to reformat my computer. When I did so I couldn't get the
onboard sound chip to recognise the drivers and the manufacturer couldn't
find out why, so they advised I disable it and use my old sound card. I
installed it and everything was working well until I went to reinstall EQ.
The game installed and it went through the update and login to your account
part alright, but when I tried to login to the Zeboxurox server I got an
"EQgame caused an Invalid Page Fault" message and the game crashed back to
the desktop. I contacted EQ Tech support and they had me downloading and
updating all the drivers for graphics, sound and Bios but the problem
persisted. They then had me lower the color resolution and I was able to
login to the Zeb. server and everything looked OK until it had finished
loading the info and the character selection screen tried to display. The
graphics went very blocky, no character names came up, I got a quick glimpse
of a really distorted character picture and the game crashed back to the
desktop. This time there was no error message.

My system is an old Pentium II 233MHz with 32Mb Voodoo Banshee graphics card
and 384Mb SDRAM and Windows 98SE operating system. EQ worked ok on it before
the virus, sometimes it lagged quite a bit but otherwise OK, but won't work
since. EQ Tech support has washed its hands of the problem and said to see
if someone on one of the forum groups could help. I got the impression the
tech really didn't know much about computers as he said he had never heard
of the Voodoo brand of graphics cards, and kept saying EQ didn't support it.

I have since suspended my account as its useless paying for a game I cant
play, but I'm hoping someone can tell me how to fix the problem so I can get
back to my characters, lvl 35 HIE Paladin and lvl 34 HIE Enchanter.
