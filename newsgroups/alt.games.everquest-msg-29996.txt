It's not something a minor usenet search wouldn't uncover, but you're
right nonetheless :p

Of course, what I really mean is 'total jackass in one way or another
with respect to me'. I can deal with assholes just fine (and even get
a laugh out of it) but once they turn it on me, the bitch goddess
comes out to play.
Otherwise, I've done that 'too nice' thing myself, from time to time.

An ogre SK really confused me last night. A male ogre I'd seen around
the first time I played (it's hard to forget someone who attempts to
hump you when you're in wolf form), he'd spent time in Cazic with
another ogre when I did. I mentioned seeing him around with the other
ogre and he say yeah, that was his bf who didn't play too much
anymore. Turned out he meant bf = best friend, but for a minute or so
my mind entertained the notion of a woman playing a male ogre, and a
semi obnoxious one to boot :) (THAT would be the ultimate roleplay!)
