       I have a Dwarf Cleric and I just hit 56 and it seems that the XP
really seems to have dropped off. I was in POS for about three hour tonight
and only got 3.5 blue bubbles filled.  I did level 55 very fast,  or so it
seemed in POS.

    Is there an XP jump after 55 or am I just playing to much Everquest :)

    Where should I be hunting at my level? I presume Teir 2 POP zones, I
have noticed Teir 1 XP is horrible now.
