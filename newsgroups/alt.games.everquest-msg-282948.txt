Technically, it's very well done. The graphics are excellent, and it's 
mostly stable and performs well. One of the features I found to be most 
well-done was the LFG/LFP tool. Groups could advertise that they are 
looking for more players - even the specific classes they wanted - and 
players could actually send a request to join a group. This was an integral 
part of the game, so you could pretty much count on everyone using it all 
the time. These points are probably what kept me playing for the not-quite-
month that I did.

The trouble is, the primary idea behind the game's design happens to be 
what ultimately drags it down. It is designed exclusively around completing 
a dungeon crawl and gathering loot along the way. After about five of those 
it's pretty plain to see what the remainder of your 10 levels will be like.

However, there was one other aspect that was almost as large a factor in my 
dropping this title so quickly. The dungeons are, as we might expect, 
repeatable and therefore a continued source of xp for some people. 
Additionally, they use loot tables rather than static loot, so some people 
might complete a dungeon several times hoping to get that bracer of +4 
stamina or such that they know is found there on occasion. As a  result, 
most dungeons you enter will involve a mad dash to the end with players who 
know it like the back of their hand, as the dungeons are typically not 
challenging enough to force any other strategy.

Well, after completing a dungeon once (or more, don't remember) you do have 
the option of choosing higher difficulty levels for later excursions into 
that same setting, but finding a group that can handle or appreciate the 
higher difficulty proved *extremely* difficult.

If you have a core group of friends who share the same idea of what you 
want out of the game, then I'd say you'll get your money's worth, even if 
it's much shorter lived than even the typical WoW career. If not, I 
wouldn't bother. It's *not* an online version of the P&P version. It's a 
candy-coated, shallow Diablo-esque version of it that is all about the loot 
with the imagination and adventure aspects of the P&P version conspicuously 
absent.
