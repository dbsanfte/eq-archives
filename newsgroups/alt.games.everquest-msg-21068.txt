Yes. From the official EQ Board:

"Well, actually, there are plenty of trade skills that folks make a profit
from. There just aren't any that people make a profit from by selling stuff
to vendors. We have no intention to create trade skills that reward people
for the number of mouse clicks they can make every hour. The intent is to
create trade skills that are profitable when items are sold to other
players, allowing (forcing) them to deal with other people to make their
money."
