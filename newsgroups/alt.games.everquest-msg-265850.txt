If the players can interact with people in an instance freely there is
no point in instancing in the first place. If they can't, the
limitation is there.

I know you are focusing on instancing as a means of controlling
overpopulation but really sufficient content does it much better.
James' examples that refer to loot equivalency is only a concern if
there really isn't loot more or less equal to each other, and EQ with
its linear loot advancement is a bad example - for example you have
absolutely no reason to take a dex or agi or str item over a hp item
as a melee, the stat balance isn't there, so its easy to see which
piece is better even when they are close. There is only ONE better way
in EQ (more or less).

Reward via spawnable quest then instead of drop. There are so many
better ways to do this than instancing it into a single group pocket
dimension.
