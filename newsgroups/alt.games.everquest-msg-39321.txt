The first time I burned out on EQ (at the ripe old age of level 16, heh) I
cancelled my account and took a 2 or 3 month break.  When I decided to start
playing again, I signed up and was back up and running within minutes.  Since
I already had a station account, it didn't take long at all.  Even though the
$10/month isn't much, I didn't want to pay them for time I wasn't playing.

When I burned out (kinda) the second time, just recently, I just *seriously*
reduced the amount of time I played for a couple of months but didn't bother
cancelling.  I've been back in the swing of things lately and loving it again.
So it can work either way you do it.
