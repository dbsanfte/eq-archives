It doesn't work all the time for all people. I've had to let people know 
their text was consistently not displaying for me in a certain hotkey 
that apparently no one had a problem with before, while at the same time 
they would have another hotkey using the same %t which displayed 
properly. Don't know anything aobut why that would be, just know that 
sometimes it is.
