First time, 3 hours, 11 restarts.

Then entered Jaggedpine, EQ crashed... :(


Three hours later after 2 forty minute patches, entering Jaggedpine twice,
only to have EQ crash those two times (argh), finally got to Jaggedpine,
only to have about five minutes to spend there and at least fined a banker
two buildings away from zone-in point.

Can't wait to explore the zone.
