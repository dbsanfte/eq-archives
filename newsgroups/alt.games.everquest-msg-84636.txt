And most of this thread was spent proving that *everyone* thinks that the
spirit of the law is more important than the letter of the law.  As it
should be.  But it's like pulling teeth to get some people to actually admit

actually offend anyone, all to try and prove that she thinks the letter of
the law is more important.
