I play an Ogre Shaman and have the same problem. The little guy's name is 
Zigg Flinn (or something like). I'm not sure what faction he is, but I've 
found if he is standing in his usual spot inside the blue house you can 
walk by him if you stick to the wall. Unless someone picks that time to 
open the door... In which case be ready for a mad dash to the zone. Not 
sure about necros, but for Ogre Shaman this seems to be the only safe way 
to the bank, the bards hate us and so do the clerics. The palladins and 
militia hate Ogres too, but those factions are easy to fix.
