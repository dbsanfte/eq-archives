incandescent mask.  nice INT/CHA, costs something like 15pp plus some
drops.  look it up on allakhazam.

> Neck      : Int Jewelry
i like the black alloy medallion.  5 INT/WIS and mana preservation 2.
drops in runnyeye off lord pickclaw.  i can clear the zone solo on my 42
ranger, so you and your friends should have no problems.

> Ears      : Int Jewelry
try for a batskull earring.  5 INT.

> Fingers   : Int Jewelry
> Wrists    : Cha bracelets?
golden bracer.  7 STR/INT, extended range 2.  nice item.  drops in
charassis i think.

my enchanter is wearing crystalline robes here.  6 INT and 10AC.

> Back      : ?
mystic cloak.  5 INT.  kill a couple things in unrest, kill a couple
things in najena.

> Waist     : ?
there's a decent spell haste 2 belt available in PoK.  you'll need some
foraged items for it though.  took my 34 druid about 1.5 hours to forage
the stuff for it.  also has 15 SvD/P

> Legs      : ?
drake-hide leggings drop off the goblin bartender in SolA.  has +5 CHA
on 'em.  easy fight for your friends.

> Feet      : Sol Ro Quest?  Can't remember.
might try for some GEBs ;)  i lust after those.

> Primary   : Sarnak Dagger? / Book from Kaessora?
i like opal encrusted stein here.  nice +25 CHA boost.  go for about
30-50pp in the bazaar.

> Secondary : GBS from Pyzjn
stein of moggok.  if you have a friend that can port you around it'll
take like 20 minutes to get.  +5 DEX, +10 INT, +25 SvDisease, and 3
whole charges of light healing!

my 41 enchanter is at INT 201 and CHA 157 (with radiant visage) with
that stuff on (except GEBs.  *drool*).  anything where i didn't put
anything he's either wearing crap (let's hear it for raw silk gloves!)
or whatever the OP put in.

hope that helps.
