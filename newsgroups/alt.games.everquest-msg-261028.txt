Nope, I refered directly to your turning hp into mana.

IF you'd dismissed the entire hp and mana issue, then you could fault me 
for failing to realize why you'd done so, even though you didn't put it 
explicitly in that response, because it was mentioned earlier.

However, instead of doing that, you DID discuss the regen... except that 
you turned mana regen into hp regen.

I addressed only the change in type of effect, and the point that 
there's a huge difference between the two.  If thats thread creep, so be 
it, that happens quite often on usenet.  I do think there's a clear line 
of reasoning to that creep though, it wasn't out of the blue, like 
bringing up the elephant count in the congo would be.

I am right, mana regen is generally more important than hp regen for a 
raid sized force; the two are not synonymous.  The fact that I happen to 
be right, however, wouldn't excuse me from making my point clearly, and 
from reading what you are saying and responding to it coherantly.

Running off on some tangent in the hopes of confusing the issue isn't 
helping.  You could easily have rescued yourself by saying "Oops, I 
meant mana regen, anyway neither is relevant because we have more bards 
than we know what to do with", but instead you keep trying to weasel 
out.  This isn't the first thread where I've seen you doing this, but 
this time its me banging his head against your wall, so I'm more certain 
of what is going on.

I'm killfiling you at this point, because you've demonstrated an 
inability to read or write.  If you could do one of the two, I'd try and 
help you get over your inability to do the other.  Without either, 
though, I don't see how you can be helped, and I've gone well over my 
(self imposed) limit in attempting the impossible thus far.

An alternate explanation is that you are deliberately being obtuse, in a 
more advanced form of the simple troll concept; to provoke responses.

Either way, the proper response is <plonk>.

I don't expect you to be upset about this, mind you, I'm just telling 
you so as to save your time in framing further responses
