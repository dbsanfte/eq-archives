Um, "disrupting".  If I'm medding and a mob simply passes by, I'm not
disrupted.  I believe that is where Jazz inferred (correctly) that I meant
that it had "dsrupted" my camp by either assualting a party member or the
mobs that past conviced our pull to go along with the druid (in other words,
the druid stole our pull, just to make that clear for you).  I'm sorry if
you found my post vauge or misinterpretted what I was getting at, but I'm
not used to having to spell EVERYTHING out.

Try digging a little deeper Biz, where I expanded upon the "exhausting the
supply".  The part where I said he was taking all the mobs, including the
ones we were pulling back to camp.  Hmm, we agro a Mob, start bringing it
back and mr druid decides he'd make it his 4th.  No, thats where I draw the
line and go get it back.

Also, I said it was a last resort, that I tried the "nice" things first.
/tell please don't take the mobs that are being led to our camp.  Etc...  Of
course, I can always inact the Play Nice Policy and FORCE the druid to split
up the spawns with us, but who wants to bother with that and getting a
GM/Guide to come in and baby sit.
