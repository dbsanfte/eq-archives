Right, but you snipped what Tim was saying, which I was responding to: 
"I'd not mind this so much if they'd have made it make sense...e.g., if 
the quest was to loot 40 gnoll scalps or something like that...then 
killing a couple and running would clearly not satisfy the quest 
requirements."

He makes it sound like the scalp solution would be a good explaination 
for why killing part of a group doesn't count, but it seems to me that 
it isn't.

Again, I think you aren't getting what I'm saying.  I'm working on the 
"explaination" part; they require that you kill a certain number of 
individuals, but refuse to count individuals killed if you've killed 
full groups of them.  I'm saying that the solution would be to change 
the explaination so that its clear that they want full groups killed and 
won't be handing out partial credit.

Another solution would be to change the mechanic to match the request; 
in other words to count every gnoll you kill regardless of whether you 
have cleared out whole gangs, or just one each out of 10 seperate gangs 
(which sounds like it would work based on the quest giver's request, but 
which doesn't)  But that wasn't what I was talking about, which was as I 
said, a way to change the text to match the game mechanic.

Of course there's no real need to change the text, as I'm sure you'll 
rapidly learn what they really mean, and it doesn't seem that they are 
inconsistant about that; they continue to mean the same thing each time 
they say it, its just not what you and I might have thought they meant.

I don't know the system well enough to have a substantive response to 
this question.  I doubt what you are saying is true; I suspect that 
there's a difference between, say, meleeing and casting nukes, or melee 
plus spells like slow, or that there are tactics like rooting one mob 
and then running another somewhere else to kill first before the other 
catches you, or using SOW to stay out of mob reach, or... well, like I 
say, I don't really know.  I've yet to play a game where there weren't 
any tactical considerations at all, though, heck, even tic tac toe has 
the "start in the corner or in a middle edge or in the center" question.

HO's don't strike me as tactics, so much as a way to push yourself 10% 
harder by paying attention; a substitute for real tactics, if you will. 
  But I could be wrong about that, not having played the game, maybe 
there are different sorts of HO's you can choose from amongst, and you 
can alter the course of a fight by which you pick.

If you find that NPC's and PC's are interchangable, then I'll have to 
grant that there is no such thing as a multiplayer game, or that what 
I'm thinking of as "single player" CRPG's are really multiplayer too.

I don't feel that way, though, I find that "real people" are much more 
interesting, less predictable both in terms of coming up with better 
approaches and in terms of screwing up than any AI can ever hope to be. 
  And thats not to mention the chatting options, I"ve yet to find a CRPG 
NPC that could hope to pass the Turing test, while at least half the PC 
characters I've played EQ1 with could have done so with ease.

While level based buffs would reduce the "PL" component, they wouldn't 
reduce the "we already have enchanter buffs, so we don't need an 
enchanter" problem.  In EQ1 its possible, at high levels, to get a set 
of buffs which will last a couple hours such that you won't get any buff 
related benefit from having half the classes in the game in your group. 
  When you balance say enchanter class around his ability to both 
provide CC and buff your mana regen and melee speed, and your group 
already has the mana regen and melee speed, then the enchanter just lost 
half his value to the group.

Since Luclin?  They added LDoN (great from 20 to 55, not so good after 
that except for the LDoN points to buy decent items, which are now 
outclassed by OOW items), they added LOY (great from 30 to... what, 60? 
  Higher?)  They added POP, which has content thats groupable from 46 up 
(tough, but doable) and soloable from 52 or so up (lower if you are a 
bard or some other lucky class).  I've heard that GOD and OOW also have 
some content usable from 45 on, although I never really tried it.

I note you don't say "what made the game to me was the ability to buff 
people I wasn't grouped with" or "I only played so I could roam around 
and help people out who were in trouble, while making sure they got the 
exp", or "I loved doing quests where I got credit for killing parts of 
groups" (the latter because of course quests in EQ1 almost all sucked, 
so nobody spends a lot of time reminiscing about how they were implemented)

While I'm sure you have complaints about EQ2, I'm missing something 
about just what they really are.  I don't think they are really the same 
ones that Tim had, although I could be wrong about that.
