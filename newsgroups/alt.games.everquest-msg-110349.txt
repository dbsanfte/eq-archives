    Very bad idea. This locks up the cleric something awful, and leave
little room for redundant fizzle casts.

    But to answer the original poster: a 2 second CH chain means after
cleric (x-1) starts casting CH, two seconds later cleric x starts casting
CH. Two seconds is extreme - that's our Avatar of War CH spacing, because
he'll kill someone in about 5 seconds.

    Here's the problems I see with that hotkey (and remember, I'm just
thinking in terms of an AoW-level encounter where timing is crucial). One,
it has only one attempt to cast CH in it. So if, Brell forbid, your cleric
fizzles they MUST wait the length of the "pause" before being able to cast
again. So that cleric's CH is, for all practical purposes, blown. And unless
the cleric is a quick typist, nobody else knows the cleric's CH was blown.
The pause also prevents a cleric from switching targets ASAP if the MT
suffers an unplanned death. They have to wait out the pause.

    This is what my hotkey looks like for CH:

/cast CH
/healerchannel Comp Healing on >> %t << NEXT_CLERIC UP!
/cast CH
/groupsay Comp Healing on >>%t << NEXT_CLERIC UP!
/cast CH

    The next cleric is expected to remember how many seconds to count off
before casting, and to count. We're quite demanding of our clerics. :-) The
three redundant /cast commands pretty much ensure that when another clerics
sees you say you're CH'ing someone, you really are casting. This macro also
executes very quickly, and can be ducked out of if you need to retarget. The
/groupsay is because we usually have the CH group together in one group -
yes, some of our clerics still don't have very legible chat channel colours,
boo them. (I use magenta and yellow for the incoming messages from my first
two chat channels - they show up nicely and are distinct from all the other
defaults.) We use a healing channel so for regular encounters people can
duck out of redundant heals, and for the tough stuff our "cover" team can
monitor every heal. The cover team is a group of four clerics that count the
delay after every CH call, and if they don't see a healing message come up
when it should immediately cast their own CH to "cover" for the cleric that
missed.

    The system is still being tweaked and modified - we still aren't happy
with how we make tank transitions, and we're still getting issues with
access to mod rods without clicking on another player that's crowding the
clerics - but it works fairly well.

    James
