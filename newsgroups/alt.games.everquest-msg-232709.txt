Not a full answer, but, max haste is capped by level, I just
don't know where to find a chart with the info on it.

This was an issue pre-pop for pet classes because pet's max
haste was capped by their level - and BOIV apparently maxxed
it w/o a muzzle.  They changed it so that pet haste was capped
by the caster's level.  I'd look at the steel warrior or the
safehouse for a chart - I'd wager they have one.
