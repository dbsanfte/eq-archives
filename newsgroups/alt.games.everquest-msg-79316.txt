Yeah, I felt that way too.  But when I was level 16 and trying and dying to
get to level 17 all I could do is ask myself, "is RvR worth it?"

When the answer switched from "yes," to "let's see," to "I hope so," to "it
BETTER damned well be worth it," to "no," it was time for me to go.  It
seems to me that DAOC gives you nothing to look forward to besides one
thing.  That's it.

That's not enough for me.
