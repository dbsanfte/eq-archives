If you are in the right temple, go in to the first split, take a right,
then take the second left. It will be a bit of a trek down, and be sure to
have invis, cause there are skorpikuses everywhere (who in their right mind
would hunt those things when they are still blue?), and you'll hit the orb.
The orb room has a good 9-10 skorps in it, so have your key on your cursor
before you get there...that many harm touches will lay anyone out.
