The cleric was right.  And you were right.  You were "backup healer", it
is your responsibility not to let anyone die, and its the cleric's
responsibility to keep people's HP bars up.

By keeping the tanks at 40% HP, you became the main healer, because the
cleric was using CHeal protocols, which means getting that CHeal to hit
while the tanks are low on HP for the most HP back per mana spent.

But the cleric was wrong about the point at which he'd chosen to heal; 20%
was clearly too low a target for him to consistently hit, and its
important that he be able to hit his CHeal target every time, or err on
the side of live tanks, not dead tanks.  He should have started Chealing
at 50% (so they'd complete at an estimated 30%), then adjusted downwards
till his heals were hitting with the tanks down to a comfortable 20% or so
life remaining... cutting it finer than that requires really knowing your
tanks well and your mobs well, and isn't reccomended in a new place or
when roaming around where adds might be lurking.  Instead he was starting
at 20% with a target of 1% and missing it, and then adjusting up till the
tanks lived... or perhaps not adjusting at all.

At any rate, with a backup healer, there's still no need for tanks to die
while a CHeal is coming in; its your job to hit the tank with heals to
help them over the hump.  40% is not "the hump"(OK, it can be, but not in
a regular exp group).  Wait till the tank is down to 10%, and keep your
eye on the cleric's Cheal message.  There's not a damned thing he can do
to change his timing on that, its going to be exactly 10 seconds in every
case, so you should learn the feel of that 10 seconds; if the tank is at
10% and has 5 seconds to go, its going to be "too close to call" and you
throw him a fast heal.  If he's at 10% and has only one second to go
(assuming the cleric started heals at 20%, that is), then you know he's
going to be fine, and you save your mana for something more useful.  If
he's at 10% and there's 7 seconds to go, maybe you should Evac, cause your
cleric is clearly hallucinating, and your puny druid heals aren't likely
to make a good backstop for long, that tank just lost 10% of his HP bar in
3 seconds!

Oh, and "the cleric got stunned?"  How on earth did that happen?  If the
cleric's been aggroed, he shouldn't be trying to throw Cheals around; even
if his decision is that he has to focus on healing the MA he'd better use
fast heals until the situation is under control, channeling a CHeal with
its mighty 10 second cast time is an "iron man" feat best saved for
showing off for the ladies at a drunken bachelor party in the arena.
Better still, stun that mob, root it, move away, and then worry about
healing the tank; backup healer hopefully kept things afloat during the
gap.
