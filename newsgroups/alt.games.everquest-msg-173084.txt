	Too Many.

     Yeah... When I saw the title of this post I thought we would
get yet another posting of the ten page variety.  But it does
appear to me that he did write most, if not all it himself.  Yes,
some of the passages may seem to be eerily similar to the Quitter
Generator, but then that thing was put together from the source
of "I quit" posts that have been written throughout the ages.
