And promptly land in my /ignore. If you can't type an intelligible
query, I ain't helping you. Why remove half the playerbase from your
possible help pool? If you want a merchant that is non Kill on sight
to your ogre, ask for one.

Soanso shouts "esalkrughviurgiuytweo[afUYuy8OQEWHGTUR"

Player_01 shouts "What? did you fall on your keyboard?"

The point being, very common acronyms are generally acceptable, like
KOS, SOW, but if you have to reference a manual to figure it out, you
are bordering on d00dspeak. 
Warning about trains and calling evac to your group are a lot more
lenient situations. Hot-keyable, too.

Soanso shouts " train to z---!!" 

Player_01 says to the group "Uh-oh! get off the tracks, guys!"
