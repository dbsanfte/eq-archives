Wouldn't it be better to say that the 59-60 people are elitist snobs? (The
ones that say you have to be 57+ to lose the "n00b" title)

"N00b" has to be one of the most pathetic insults on the face of the
Earth... when you were age 10, did you walk up to a baby and scream "You
n00b!" So anyone that tries to use that to berate someone is probably a
loser.
