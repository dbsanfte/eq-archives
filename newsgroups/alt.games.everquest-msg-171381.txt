The temper is the sticking point right now. I dont know how to make the oak
bark tanning, I will hire someone. But the blue diamonds are expensive and
to fail, doh!

Ive a 212 wis unbuffed with the items i have and a 798 ac with diamond skin
and spikecoat. Which isnt bad. I still get hit, and a dblue mob in mistmoore
sent me running at 46, a black wolf of some sort that hit for 250. I ran.
Root wouldnt stick. The easiest thing for me to do right now is tunarian
soldiers armour. Nothing to kill just need to farm pp from splitpaw or
something for money. I make 200pp an hour there easy with just fs weps. When
i get my tailoring up to max im going to make decent armor for the newbs at
cost. Im tired of the stuck up toons out there that are hogs and wont share
anything.

Oh and I dont kite, nope not at all. To many adds. I rather root, snare,
drones, immolate and wait. Safer that way.
