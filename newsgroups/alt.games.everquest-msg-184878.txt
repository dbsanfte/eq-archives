I dont know what verant where thinking when they decided to make rune cost
10.5 pp. Maybe something that can cause arguments between players to enrich
our online experience? Probably dreamed up by the same einstein who designed
the ragefire spawn in skyfire, or put 5 or 6 HG spawns in RM. (etc, etc etc
etc etc......)
I gave up on my cleric at 51... couldnt stand the constant arguments with
greedy sob's who wanted me to pay for dots, but couldnt even spare me a gem
or two free loots to compensate. My hat goes off to anyone with the patience
to sit through 65 levels of this crap. I give clerics free KEI these days,
my small contribution to fixing Verants problem.
