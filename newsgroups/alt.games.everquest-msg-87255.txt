We killed him for a friend on Sunday.  He is *much* easier than Gorenaire, and
no harder than the old ragefire, other than he Enraged at the end. (since he
is now over 56.   Still no deaths.

He has the same loot he had in Sol B.   All Nafagen dropped loot, minus the
Burning Book.    Including Red Dragon scales, (we got 2) the 100% Weight
Reducing bag (got one from him) and rarely the Cloak of Flames (haven't seen
it, but I'd be damn suprised if they removed one thing and left all the rest).
