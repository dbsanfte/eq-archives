The freebie gear varies fairly wildly in usefulness.  For example, the
Paladin weapon is substantially inferior to either of the weapons the
Rogue gets, and the Paladin bracers are hugely inferior to banded for
any class that doesn't cast DoTs (they're renamed Serp Bracers), and
you can count the number of DoTs a Paladin gets without using a single
finger or toe.  OTOH, the Rogue, as mentioned, gets a decent pair of
weapons, and the Necro gear apparently is sufficient to put an Erudite
over 200 INT.  The Ranger gets a renamed Trueshot Bow, but no arrows
and zero Fletching skill (all skills except tradeskills are at level
cap, apparently for all classes).  Some of the Enchanter pieces are
inferior to Arcane Scientists (Freeport newbie caster), others are
quite nice, but the focus effects are nearly useless.  If it weren't
for the really stupid things like the Serp Bracers for Paladins (oh,
and the Paladin gets a Splitpaw Mask with the light removed, grats
any Human or Erudite Paladins who would actually wear such a mask
specificly for the light) and things like the +2 INT rings for
Enchanters the gear looks a lot like what a 25 could get untwinked.
