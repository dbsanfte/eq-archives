he he he. I couldn't find it myself the first time for ages, and nearly
died trying. It's not all that obvious. There's one "finger" of the
chasm channels that has two temples facing each other. You don't want
those. There's another channel further along that has a temple entry on
the right towards the back. That's the one you want. You go in straight
to the back, turn right, then it's either the first or second left hand
turn. You'll see it goes down a ramp anyway. It turns and twists a
couple times on the way down, and is jam packed with scorpici, but at
the bottom is a tomato just like the entry to Seb. (Well, the one for
Seb isn't covered with HT'ing Scorpici crawling all over it, but you get
the idea.) Click and enter.

If find it easiest to take the loc off the eqatlas map. If you are
running from OT, you go around to the *far* side of the chasm, and go up
to the edge of the correct chasm "finger" by loc. (I think it's the
second one you come to if you ran around to the left of the chasm. You
can look down from the top and see the temple entry. Get a lev on and
just jump down invis. Easy Peasy.
