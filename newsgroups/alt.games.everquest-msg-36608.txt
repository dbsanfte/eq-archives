Is it still a good game to buy now? I never heard of everquest before but it
seems a nice game to me. I have got a couple of questions about it.

Is it still worth the money or should i wait for another multiplayer game
like earth and beyond?
How long does the game stays fun?
Is there a lot of action?
how does the quest system work?

thanks in advance.
