Actually, I thought limiting the proc to lvl35 was a little harsh...
Wakizashi procs 80/81dd at lvl 20... Ghoulbane procs 132dd vs Undead at lvl
20 (pre-nerf twink). I figured they might nerf the dam/delay/AC with the
'Recommended Level' but limit the proc to 20.

But it DID need nerfing, just not that badly :o)
