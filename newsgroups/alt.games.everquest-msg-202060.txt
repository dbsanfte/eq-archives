Find a bunch of (preferably) social mobs.  Because they're
social, they'll assist each other.  Pull *all* of them.  
Now, charm one of them, have it attack one of its buddies,
the others will beat on it - refresh charm until your
pet is pretty low health, then switch to chants to finish
the pet.  Select another, repeat.  Use your first charm
song until the mobs you're after are too high a level
for it to work.  The short duration means you don't
have to break charm yourself when it's time to kill your
pet.  If you have to use 39 charm, have invis memmed 
also, as 39 charm has a decent duration, and you'll
have to break charm manually when the time comes.

You're going to need a few things set up to make this
easier - 

One, make sure you know which key is your "Switch between
the last 2 targets" key.  Look in your options/keyboard
panel - it's in there in the general section IIRC.

This will allow you to do less manual targeting - EG

Target a mob in a group of like mobs
Charm him
Target one of his friends
/pet attack
Hit the switch targets key - you're back on
your pet.  
When charm breaks -
-if the pet is really low health, chant him to
death
-else recharm, hit the switch targets key,
hit the /pet attack key

When you've chanted your pet to death, hit
the switch targets key, then use the beat
up mob as your next pet (make use of the
damage your previous pet already did)
Now, manually target another mob and
/pet attack.

Two, if you can, get a SoW or J/T-boots.  I know, Selos
is way faster, but until you get the longer lasting one
(50?) sow is just fine for this, and frees you from having
to twist it in.

Three, practice on lower level mobs if you can.

Four, watch what you drag over, those mobs will have
very little aggro for you personally and have a tendency
to come off on others.

Five, practice using 3rd person while running around, 
you'll need to be able to look back at the swarm.

Six, set up a hot key that is /pet attack 

That's all I can think of to say about it :)

I've only done a little of this, so others who do it
more often please feel free to chime in with what I
could do better.
