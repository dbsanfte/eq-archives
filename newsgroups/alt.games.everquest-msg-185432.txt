Maybe same guy on AB that thinks NegerJoe is a good choice of name.

I've been petitoning this name everytime I log on, and as of yet its not be
dealt with, I had one guide pop up and say he would "look into it" but thats
the last I've heard and the guys still running around.

I guess it must be terribly wrong to use a copyrighted name, or rip off a
work of fantasy literature but is fine to use Insulting and racist names in
Sonys book =/
