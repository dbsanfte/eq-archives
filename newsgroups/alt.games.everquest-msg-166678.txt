Why not just say the damn thing (the bazaar, I mean) is a FLEA-MARKET and 
be done with it?  You know, bunch of people come in with assorted crap to 
sell, others come in and buy it.  And if two or more vendors have the 
same item, one will (sometimes) buy out the other(s) and raise prices a 
little...they all make money, they go home happy.  (This assumes, of 
course, that the buying vendor can sell enough of the "product" to cover 
costs and a little more, so that he can show a profit.)

And when I said "crap" I meant multiple and various items - some are gold 
to one and trash to another, while the next is gold to the other and 
trash to the one.
