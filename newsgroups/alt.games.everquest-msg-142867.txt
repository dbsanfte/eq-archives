 /agree

The problem in EQ is always and always will be rather odd decisions
made by Verant. Don't blame this on Druids place it where it belongs.
Lose the class envy and crap, take what they give and play what they
give us. Or move on...thats our only real pair of options. 

Course guilds don't really help when they lock you into one toon and
one guild or no guild for alts. Class changes aint easy and deserve
support from guilds not discouragement, IF you want people to enjoy
themselves anyway.

Be cool have fun..
