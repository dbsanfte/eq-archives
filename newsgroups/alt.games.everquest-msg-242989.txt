   Yep.  My high elf cleric is also amiable in Paineel, and they couldn't
love her more in Erudin.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I had topped out my
Erudin faction well before I could get my hole key.  I think I did in about
3 days of non-stop slaughter.  	Well, I stopped to sleep and eat and
stuff.  But you get the idea.

   Also, Lenny v2.0, and ogre *shadowknight* is amiable to the high elf
cleric guildmaster.  Now he wants to go to the Plane of Growth and see if
Tunare likes him to.  I'm nervous about this.  I want to go see my god
also, but him, I want to wait till the new graveyard is in place.  Just in
cast they hate him so much there that they camp his corpse till his body
rots.
