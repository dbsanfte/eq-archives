You have up to a week, real-time, to recover your gear.  I can
empathize with you, had a similar incident crossing Antonica
when I was first learning the game, but I would point out that
if there were no in-game risk at all EQ would be a lot less
interesting to play.  What is your character name and server?
It is possible that somebody from this group might be able to
help you recover your stuff.
