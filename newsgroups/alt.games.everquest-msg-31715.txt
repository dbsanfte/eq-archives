Hi all,

I know you were waiting with baited breath for my contribution to this
serialized novel.

To many people (myself included), the game is an escape from the mundane RL
and an opportunity for some therapeutic socialization. Distracting names
intrude on this immersion as does the 'd00dsp34k' we are all so tired of. I
know from my paper & pencil days of D&D that names like 'butuglee' or
'ownzu' would not have been acceptable as they take away from the atmosphere
the players were trying to generate.

To others, EQ is a chat-room with graphics. They play to become kewl and
achieve some sort of bizarre on-line status. They start charcters with
offensive names just to run around begging and dueling because they are
bored.

The two types (RPer/d00d) will never see eye-to-eye because they are looking
for different things from their gaming experience. Fortunately Verant is
more concerned with an immersive fantasy environment. Yes there are a few
compromises to pop culture (Guard Lars and Guard Ulrich come to mind). But
these NPC's do not say 'Yo bro! u luk lik u cud use a Fire Beetle Eye' when
hailed.

I don't know what the solution is, but for now, if you choose a questionable
name you do it at your own risk You are creating a lessening of the
immersive environment. And don't say the environment is not immersive. Just
read the 'Do you ever get scared' thread to see how immersive EQ can be.

And yes - the stupid names do scream 'dontgroupwithme' but it's not worth
the annoyance.

I like top posting  : P

Drywit <<<<=== Very questionable name. I don't care if they change it, won't
hurt my enjoyment of the game at all.
