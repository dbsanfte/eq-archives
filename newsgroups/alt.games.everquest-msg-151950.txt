My 21st bard is using a conch shell horn and having let him sit idle for the
last several weeks, I havent a clue since the patch, but the Charismatic
Carillon song seemed to work best iirc. I targeted myself, went and had dinner,
watched Raymond for an hour and he was maxed for his level. Hmmm...gotta check
this...
