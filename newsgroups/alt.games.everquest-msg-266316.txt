Ah... frozen yellow garden hose, I remember it well.  My first house I 
networked my office, my garage (where the big iron was... waste all that 
space on cars?  pfft!), the living room, the kitchen, and my son's 
bedroom.  He was 2yo at the time, but hey.

It all routed into the garage, where I installed an air conditioning 
duct, and filled up all the holes so that it was dustproofed.  There, I 
had 2 Convergent boxes, a Solbourne, and a Pyramid (work was giving it 
away to anyone that would haul it ... think 3'deep by 12' long by 6' 
high).  From there, I had a LOS wireless hookup to a software company 
down the street that had 3 T1's and didn't mind sharing bandwidth so 
long as I set up interested employees with LOS wireless.

The second house... well, the wife refused my pleas to turn the garage 
into a clean room.  We had to toss the Pyramid and Convergents (I kept 
the Solbourne, by god), and I went to wireless for everything.  Cable 
modem to a wireless router.  My wife's car sits in the garage... along 
with a washer and dryer, for god's sake.

I miss my old house :-(
