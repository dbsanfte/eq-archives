LOL. I knew this was Hadden almost as soon as I read the words.

A month is ridiculous. Sounds like the Seb thing on Povar (I didn't know
about that one, and Povar's my server - interesting). We've had some
problems recently on Povar with both Hadden and the Grim Runner. Hadden in
particular is bad with the 6 hour +/- 20min spawn or so, but most of the
problems we've had in that area have been folks deciding they don't want to
wait, showing up, and KS'ing. In this case, I mean what most of us would
consider a KS (respectful of camps assuming they are reasonable camps)
rather than the "who was quick enough to hit first" that SOE uses. In the
case of the Grims, we have twice now in our guild alone, had a probem with
camping the grim, then suddenly have someone (the same someone) suddenly
show up and say "my camp, I was LD" along with some other toon that will
show up if required to say "I can vouch for them". These would be the same
two toons that have had Rallic Packs for sale in the bazaar every day now
for a while and where at least one of them was in the bazaar shouting to
sell a pattern cheap about 10 min before the supposed LD. The GM's handling
of these situations has been less than stellar.

Were it me, I'd still report it to the GM's along with background. Some will
just not care, others will take an interest and watch it. You may put them
onto someone who's doing an eBay or playerauctions plat scheme, and you may
then get to see their account banned - wouldn't that be nice?

Don't get your hopes up, but it could happen.
