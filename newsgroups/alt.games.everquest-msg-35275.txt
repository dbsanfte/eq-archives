I wonder what the purpose of learning languages like gnoll, froglok
and elder dragon are? Surely it isnt just so that you can understand
them when they say "Soandso have destroyed their own lands! They'll
not destroy mine!" as they attack. I have seen gnoll skins with
writing on them that you may be able to read.
