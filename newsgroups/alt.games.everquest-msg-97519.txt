No it has not. All that they've proven is that it will be easier. The
degree has been shown to them time and again that its not very large.
Even if you ignore that, they have *utterly* failed to prove that it
will be made *too* easy. 100% dismal failure on that front, to the
point that they've even backed down to "we fear for the future
patches, not the present patch."

Fraid that wasn't my foot, Jazz. :-D

Life got a little easier for the newbs. No disagreement. Life did
*not* get too easy because they don't have to get their corpse
anymore.

Still waiting on how it makes life too easy. You nicely skipped around
it once again....

Because its boring and dumb, of course. What sane individual actually
thinks staring at the spellbook is a *good* thing? /sigh

The chorus of outraged responses? ROFL

Take a poll in the game. See how many actually want to keep the
spellbook. Get back to me on that one. /snicker

Take a look outside EQ. See how many people quit because one of the
reasons was spending so much time staring at the spellbook.

Sorry to say but its starting to sound like you're so insulated from
the vast majority of MMORPG players you can't see the silliness of
some parts of EQ anymore. That you *support* the spellbook is all the
evidence of THAT I need.
