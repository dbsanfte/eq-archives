A) up till now, my HP regen line stacked with cabbage -and- regrowth (et 
al).

B) Even now, my hp+mana regen line stacks with regrowth line



C) Regrowth lasts a few minutes, so if the druid isn't coming along for 
the ride, its not really important.  Buffs that last an hour+ are 
interesting in all circumstances, buffs that last under 10 minutes are 
only of interest in a group situation, and even then must be considered 
carefully for cost effectiveness.  If you can cast it before going in to 
an LDoN, then med to full, and expect it to last the whole mission, then 
cost effectiveness isn't a question.
