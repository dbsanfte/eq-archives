Bah LOL, the main char i am waiting for them to restore is a 53 cleric and I
don't hate rangers (obviously or i wouldn't be playing one now lol), then
again i have had the pleasure of grouping with excellent rangers.
My problem lies/lays (grammar whore's do feel free to jump in lol) in I had
never grouped with a ranger before I hit my late 40's and they were always
higher in level then me and knew how to avoid getting agro. I never
questioned them on how they did it before getting jolt I was just glad they
were good at what they did. Only time I had problems was when I got 3
rangers in my group on an unplanned  raid (raid leader had a sick sense of
humor).
Anyways lol, I don't run around screaming when i get agro since i was taught
very early in my cleric's life that it makes taunting a mob off you nearly
impossible.
Most of the replies here and on a ranger's board I posted on seem to be
pointing to the same thing which is the point you made and to use my
slower/lower dmg weapons on a regular basis when my tank can't hold agro off
me, which I suppose is easy enough to do, I can always pull out my higher
dmg toys for emergencies, soloing, and ghetto groups.
Any other tips are welcomed, enjoying playing a ranger but I don't want to
end up the ranger that is either a mana sponge or dead =p
