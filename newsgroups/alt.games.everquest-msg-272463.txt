Yeah. Definately semantics. (Not sure if I'll concede 'silly' though)

I duuno. I think you're comments on finding the class fun are certainly 
relevant. If EQ2 succeeds with its forumula of 'being fun'. That's a 
good thing. From a practical standpoint that's all it needs. 

From a more theoretical perspective I'm still dispointed that classes 
are not more uniquely 'able' then others. The different utility that 
tanks bring to EQ1 uniquely enables them to engage various mob types... 
in a dense goblin dungeon with sowed opponents, snare for example is 
crucial... shadowknights aren't the only one that can snare, they aren't 
even the best at it... but -someone- has to be able to, and if you swap 
the tank with another tank class your group might not be functional 
anymore, in that dungeon. I like that.

I don't mind that rangers, druids, necros, and berserkers also have 
snare. I would be disappointed if warriors and paladins did though, 
because that makes me completely interchangeable with any other tank. 
You see the difference?
