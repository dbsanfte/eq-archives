So in some ways the randomness can help you. For the most part though
it works against you. 

In verant's defense though (someone who I really never defend since I
think they are a horrible game company.. yeah and yet I've played
their game for 2 years.. go figure .. ahaha) Imagine if the AC there
was not so rare but he always popped on about the 4th spawn as he did
with me. What would happen?

I Tell you what would happen, you'd have 60 players lined up there
like a revolving door to be next to camp the soon to spawn AC as soon
as one got the ring another would step up. It would really end up
making jboots a trivial item. 

What I think should be done though, is the introduction of a "ok that
has been camped enough timer" where if say the AC had not spawned in 5
hours it spawns for SURE the next spawn... or maybe some longer period
to prevent  lining up like 6 hours.

Since my experience the way I camp the AC now, or suggest that others
camp it in oot is to only camp it for about 2 hours. If you don't get
the AC in two hours you are really no more likely to get it in 10
hours as it is a small random chance EVERY spawn. Go and do other
stuff and come back for 2 hours another day. Don't camp it for 12
hours, randomness does not mean more time there increases your chances
but that you can just as likely get the AC in 45 minutes as in 12
hours.

If everyone followed the hour or two hour then move on rule at that
camp more people would really end up with jboots faster and there
would be less angst at that camp in general. That is the way verant
really intended it to be camped but of course due to players hanging
there for 20 hours it does not work that way. Their mistake was in
trying to predict how players would behave, you can't.

If I was verant, I would have made EQ for the long haul. I would have
made ALL LOOT random across the whole world and more or less no reason
to camp anything. I would have also made even types of loot random
like selecting from various beneficial things as in diablo 2 or
something. I would have then made jboots a random drop off of whatever
which was an appropriate level to drop them, or perhaps a quest using
items which could be a random drop off of whatever of an appropriate
level to drop them. Instead they work themselves into a corner by
having non random loot which causes more problems the more people are
on a server.

Of course, when they made EQ they probably had no idea that 2500
people would be playing it at the same time even if they only had ONE
server.
