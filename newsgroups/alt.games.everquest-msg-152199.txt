I don't really have much to add to this...aside from asking:

How do you spell that sound that you make, sometimes called
a chortle, that happens when you've had a bit of a cold and you
almost choke yourself when reading somebody's innane drivel?
Like Al Gore saying he invented the internet, or some d00d saying
he helped design something he can't even spell?

I think phonetically, it's "tchhhnnnnk!"

Any input is appreciated.
