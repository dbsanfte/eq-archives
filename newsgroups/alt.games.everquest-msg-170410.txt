Auto is also great in zones with a lot of lag.  If the person leading
changes direction quickly, they just disappear right off your screen never
to be seen again.

Also for those impromtu adventures.  Who wants to wait for everyone to log
and print maps? (not all of us have a second comp or run EQW)

I agree it's important for people to make the effort to learn their way
around the zones and not depend on others to drag them along.
