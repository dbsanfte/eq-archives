For a well-rounded SK without too severe of a faction problem, human
is good. Human's only flaw is that they're average everywhere rather
than having some outstanding stat area, but starting stats don't
really mean anything anymore. Their nightblindness is solved as soon
as they get deadeye. Ogres make a nice "big bag o' hitpoints" SK, but
if you want the bag of HP route, warrior would be better I'd think...
Their faction issues are pretty severe, though...but not as severe as
an Iksar.

Of course, there are also Gnomes, since they are naturally the master
race. ;-)
