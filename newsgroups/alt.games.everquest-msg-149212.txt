I soloed happily in CS for half of each level from 44 to 54, its so very handy
to be able to hunt mobs I'm Ally to without screwing up faction; kill one,
sit and med afk, repeat.  As a cleric, I had to use "cleric levitate" on the
cliffs, which consists of jumping off and healing myself afterwards... by the
end of my time there I was able to take the cliffs at full speed while taking
less than 20 damage, by carefully angling my descent.  I still run directly from

the CS ring to SG zone without waiting for a lev because I don't even have to
think about the run down.

Better still, though, its possible to hunt fully half the birds up there without

ever leaving the beach; target one, move in under it, pull with spell, move
back while it comes down to you.

Most common cause of death in the zone ( I lived there a long time, I got
to rez hundreds of people ) is spilled Sirens and Bulthars.  Accidental aggro
of Drakes and Azureake were also popular.  Early on, Azureake was
a massive hazard, but they made some changes and you no longer get
on his hate list if he happens to nuke you while going after someone else...
now he and the drakes are only a minor hazard
