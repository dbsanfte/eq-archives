There are good bugs and bad bugs. I agree that this was a bug and needed a
bug fix, but it did show the light.

Specifically forcing people to abandon camps by balancing the reward with
weight. In this case, all of the drops I saw were 240 silver which not many
would throw away and few would want to carry for any length of time.

On the down side with Tovax dropping that much loot: I am trying to figure
out how he is involved in the evil side of a quest if there is an evil side.
I know he occasionally walks to the ruins and drops a letter to the Freeport
Necro Guild. I know taking the letter to the paladin in N Qeynos,
Thurgston<sp?> results in faction.

I walked around the entire evil area of the catacombs trying to get an NPC
to respond to his name and got nothing. Talking to Tovax with my necro got
me nothing.

Because of the 240 silver loot drop, every dewd in the zone was killing him
first chance they got. This was after the patch and no matter what I shouted
about being on a quest and to let him live, every moron took their best
shot. Some of them were in their 30s, so money should not have been a
problem.

It seems like a worthy quest to figure out if his reason for going to the
ruins is tied to Pyzjn. Not that she would live long enough to have my necro
hand her the letter.
