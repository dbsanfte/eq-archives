Thank you for taking the time out to relate to us your problems.

We at tech support are happy to hear your cries and point out one thing, its
life! Life sometimes sucks! sometimes you don't get what you want in a
timely matter.

And, unlike your parents, crying at it will not make the tech problems on
our end go away.

Thank you and enjoy EverQuest.
