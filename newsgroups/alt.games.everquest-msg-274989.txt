Ok, lets say you've got a set of dual wields that do 10 damage every second 
and a one handed weapon that does 30 damage every 3 seconds.  The dps is the 
same, 10 dps.

Now, lets say you fighting a group of three monsters, each with 100hp. With 
the dual wields, the first monster is dead after 10 seconds and you move on 
to the next one.  Second one is dead in 10 seconds, same with the third. 
Overall time with the dual wields 30 seconds.

With the one handed weapon you hit for 30 at the start, 3 seconds later 
another 30 point hit (60 total), 3 seconds later 30 more (90 total), 3 
seconds later 30 more (120 total, monster dead), over all time elapsed 10 
seconds BUT your next hit won't be for another 3 seconds on the second 
monster and now the dual wielder is 2 seconds (and 20 damage) ahead.  The 
more monsters, the further behind you get (in this case 2 seconds for each 
monster over the first one).

I hope I'm explaining this clearly.  I thought about it on the ride to work 
today. Any flaws in my logic?
