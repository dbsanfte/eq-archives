As a 54 Enchanter with a 234 int and a 108 cha unbuffed 148 buffed there is
a minor improvement  when charmming a mob when buffed. Its nothing
spectactular rough guess with blue mobs maybe a 10-15% better success rate
with a Cha when charmming. I have never noticed Cha have any effect on
Mezzing though. I personally prefer the Int gear for mana as I am always
groupped and rarly charm a mobs.
