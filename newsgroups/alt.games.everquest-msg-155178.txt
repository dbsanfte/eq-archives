Yes, I do.  You'll note I said this tactic was of dubious merit, but I
have seen people using it.

I figure it's usually the type of person who /auctions periodically
that they've got "A whole slew of great weapons and armor, priced
between 1000pp and 50000pp!" who doesn't want to list them in the
auction because there are too many of them, or because it might result
in people not looking at his merchant's wares.

And if you do the "search by trader" slider, when you've got over 250
traders that can be quite frustrating.  Not sure if you can put the
player's name in the search query, because I've never bothered to try,
but that could make this tactic unnecessary as well.
