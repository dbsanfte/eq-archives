Playing a Tank as my main I must disagree.  Unless I have grouped with
someone before and could trust them your practice of waiting until Tanks are
under two bubbles would probably cause me to leave your group.  Being a
Warrior, my Character is solely dependant upon the SOWer in the group and
Healer in the group.  We do not get those really nice GATE your butt home
spells.  If things go south in a fight we end up running to zone hoping SOW
does not run out and pulling huge train behind us.  Your mana reserves are
unimportant.  If you run out then we stop pulling.  I hate casters saying
things like 20% mana or 40 % mana.  As Tanks we have no Earthly idea what
that means as far as the number of spells you have left to cast before you
are out.  A better approach would be to say "I have 3 light heals left or I
have 2 full heals left."  Please stop with the 20, 30, 40%,...  It does us
no good.

Here is why you should keep your Tanks up.  If you let Tanks get under 2
bubbles and a ADD comes into your camp, what are you going to do?  If you
are getting attacked you cannot heal the Tanks.  They will continue to go
down and the healers will be trying to get away from Add monsters.  If you
keep your Tanks up then if an Add comes into your camp the Tanks can turn
their attention to the Add.

As for being agroed while medding please do not run.  Running around and
trying to catch a frightened caster makes life that much harder.  Stand and
take a few shots while us TAUNTERS get the beast off of you.  I have seen
more casters die in my group because they panic when they start getting hit
and run around.

Also.  If your main tanks says run then please listen to him or her.  There
was a time on LUCLIN when a Druid and Wizard was teamed with me.  We were
trying our hands at taking on Vampires.  It was dark blue to all three of
us.  Druid had his evac spell up and we all were SOWed.  I pulled Vamp in
with arrow shot and started having at it.  My hits on it were like throwing
spit balls at it.  In 15 seconds I was down to like 50% health.  Druid
starts healing.  The Wizard was Nuking Vampire with fire based spells.  In
another 15 or so seconds I was back down to 50% health and the Vampire had
only lost like 20 % of its health.  I asked the Druid to evac us.  He said,
"no, we are doing fine".  He burns the rest of his mana and I am back to 90
% health.  Ten seconds later I am back to 50%.  I said 'EVAC NOW".  Druid
would not.  Wizard Teleports out and I start to run to zone.  Vampire was
now at about 50% health himself.  Druid gets hit a couple times and dies.  I
make it to zone.  After Druid comes back I ask him why he did not evac and
he said he thought we could handle it.  I told him that I was barely hitting
the beast and that next time he should listen to his tank.  So then I spend
the next 20 minutes avoiding monsters to retrieve his corpse.

Nukers.  Hold those nukes.  Nukes are for finishing monsters.  If you are in
a group and you cannot hold your nuke until monster is down at least 50%
then leave and solo to your hearts content.

If there is not a SOWer in the group then Monks should pull.  I know Tanks
are designed to be the best puller but if they do not have the added boost
of SOW then Monks need to pull.
