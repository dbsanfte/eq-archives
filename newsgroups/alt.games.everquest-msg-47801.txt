And what a silly situation it is too!

Since you need a key to play I don't understand why Sony aren't allowing 
the game to be downloaded. After all, they could still charge money for 
the key and save themselves the bother of pressing, shipping and selling 
  the game in stores.

Better yet, strike a deal with someone like AOL to include the game on 
their free CDs with some promo tie-in that both companies benefit from.
