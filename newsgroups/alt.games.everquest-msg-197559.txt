aww spank me with a wet noodle

I have never played by the rules, used showeq when I played eq, sometimes
use bots to kill in fps games.

Frankly I am a greifer and enjoy trashing everyone elses game experiance.

And there is not much you can do about it either

LOL put that in your pipe and smoke it
