Basically, the difference between the merchant buy prices and sell prices 
is very small with max charisma.  And most jewelers are enchanters, so... 
If a vendor anywhere actually sells the gem, it would hardly be worth 
zoning twice to check the bazaar first on the odds you might save 3pp.  

This gives us a short list:

Diamond
Blue Diamond
Raw Diamond
Black Sapphire
Jacinth
Black Pearl
Geode
Amethyst
Polished Quartz

This list gets cut down, however, by how useful the gems are.  Blue 
Diamond is the king, there are sooo many reasons to need one.  Black 
Sapphire and Jacinth are actually used in a couple epic quests, and for 
grandmaster's trophies.  Geodes make some not-entirely-terrible twink 
gear.  Those sell in bazaar.  Geodes are slow, but do sell.  I haven't 
really tried to sell the last two, so I can't say.  Black Pearl only makes 
gear outdated since Kunark/Velious, and Diamonds are only used to make 
resist rings.  Diamonds and Raw Diamonds are also very very easy to find 
vendor diving in more than sufficient quantities.  So basically, stick 
with those first 4, and don't go much over double vendor price, and 
they'll sell.  Oh, and I don't have GoD, so I really dunno what the 
situation with Nihilite is.

And give me all your blue diamonds.  They're worthless.  I'd be glad to 
get rid of them for you. :)
