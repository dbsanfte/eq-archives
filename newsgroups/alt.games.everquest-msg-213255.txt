My Druid on FV went from 34 to 37 almost exclusively on Rathe
HGs.  The behavior there was better than on Tunare, and the
zone was less popular as well (which probably had something to
do with the better behavior).  In fact, there was usually so
little competition that I would end up just monitoring a half-
dozen or so spawns, killing PHs as they popped and sometimes
spawning more HGs than I had the mana to kill.
