Okay, I have pretty much decided on the version that contains the game, and
the Kunark (sp?) 'expansion' (correct term?).. now... I will be picking this
up tomorrow.

Are there any config tricks in running this game? Is it very graphics
intensive? How is it on memory usage? Is it going to continually try to
access swapfile, causing lag? I will probably be installing it, as I am also
the family comp tech. :( 'Course... *snicker* this also means I may have to
'test drive' the game.. lol.

Is there a real time chat 'help desk' or is this the best place to scream
for help if we run into problems?

Sorry for the duplicity if these have been pre-answered.. I HAVE been
reading and trying to keep up but you have an INCREDIBLE amount of technical
posts per day, and with juggling six NG's I get behind quickly.

Any suggestions to make this easier will be GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
