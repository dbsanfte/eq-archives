The 'I can to mez, kinda...' crowd control for enchanters in unmezzable
areas, hit em with pacify (lower agro radius to so small you have to be on
top to get agro) and memblur (essentially, atone).

It will stand there dumbly, or wander off depending on how it acts. Throw a
root before the atone and it won't go anywhere.

Note this is spell gem intensive, but is good emergency mez fodder. Also, I
run with root up always anyway.

Certainly something a cleric can use to be a pocket 'chanter, though I'd
think you'd want the mage/necro to have their pets offtanking, or perhaps
let the necro use the necromez (screaming terror IIRC).
