Woot!  Thanks a bunch.  It's amazing how a thread becomes virtually dead

The only good news I've had (in a roundabout way) is a VERY angry guy on a
different board attacking me.  I'm no stranger to flames and online
communities, so I like to think I can recognize when a flame is due to
someone being an ornery type and when someone is angry at me personally.
I'm 95% sure this one was personal, and their tone was such that...well, a
lot of us got to thinking it was a dev.  You can't read the posts now
because they were whiped from the board for being so offensive, so you'll
have to trust me that it was very suspicious (this was at eqii.com).

When a dev is pissed off at you for rocking the boat, you begin to think
maybe there are more ripples than you can see. ;)

Either that or the guy is a retired dev who once dealt with difficult
players like myself and I just tripped a nerve in him.  REALLY tripped a
nerve.
