Because multiplayer means there are multiple players. It does not mean
that everyone is grouped together. I do get tired of the BS that
soloers can't play a multiplayer game. What if they like the social
interaction of chatting with others? Some people like to solo and some
like to group. It's their choice which they do and at what time. It is
a big area and a player can solo or group as they want. Solors won't
get the best drops, ie like the items that can drop from a boss mob,
but they can get good drops at times.

Solo content is out there, maybe not as much and as easy to find but
I've never had a problem finding some into the mid 20s when I soloed.
It might not be in every zone but there are a few solo mobs into the
mid 20s in Antonica so you just have to put more effort into looking
if you want to solo all the time.
