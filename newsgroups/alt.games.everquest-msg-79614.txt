Things to try:
- Pull the new memory out
- delete the zone files for whatever zone your character is in.  If it's
multiple zones then skip this.
- Reinstall EQ
- if you have a GeForce card and are using drivers 23.11, try downgrading to
12.41

If all else fails, format your hard drive & start from scratch.
