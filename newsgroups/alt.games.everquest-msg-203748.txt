My main intention was to make people aware of the benefits of each
class... agreed each has limitations.  In particular with the classes
that people dont usualy group with, but wanted to cover the whole
spectrum.  Not necessairly wanting to point out that a individuals
heals during a certain level spectrum are not efficient.  Otherwise I
will have to start listing when each class gets their complete heal,
regen, mana regen, etc...   
but thank you for the input.
