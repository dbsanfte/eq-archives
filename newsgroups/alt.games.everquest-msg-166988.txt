Most petitions are handled by guides. Takes them less than a minute to
note the bad names and move on to the next petition. Petition queues
rarely grow over 20 in length, and of those, maybe one or two will be
badname petitions. When the queue does get over 20, it's because
something got fucked up in the latest patch. ;-p

I'm much more concerned about the "I went LD and died, I demand a
rez!" or "I dropped a bag of stuff to give to my twink and it wasn't
here when I logged the twink in, I demand a reimbursal!" petitions
wasting the CS folks' time than badname petitions. Reason being the
people who send those petitions will argue 'til they're blue to try to
get what they want even though the know damn good and well they're not
entitled to it. "C'mon, just this once!" Yeah, right.
