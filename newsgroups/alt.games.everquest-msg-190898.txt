Nope to the charm and the fear. She was still beating on me as I walked
around. ( Had clinging darkness cast on me.) My UI lets me see the number of
hp I have without having my inventory screen up. My base hp never changed. I
tend to have to agree with Eric who had the same thing happen with the Evil
Eye and that it is a bug. Now that I think about it my health did jump after
fear wore off.
