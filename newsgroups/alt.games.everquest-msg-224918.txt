Um... just about every class?

Even warriors will outdamage a comparably equipped paladin, unless the
target in question is undead, and the paladin has Slay Undead AA ability.

To give you a bit more of an idea what Lance was saying...

My warrior is better equipped than my rogue, as well as 1 level and 98 AA
points higher.    He also has a better haste item, 41 percent instead of
32-34 percent.   With equal buffs in terms of casted haste, ranger attack
buffs and avatar, my rogue does twice as much damage per second as the
warrior did.

The only classes that do less damage are pure support classes, and even some
of them could win if the group was able to make do without thier healing /
slowing / etc, allowing them to nuke and DoT.
