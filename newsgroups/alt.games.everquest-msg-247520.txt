If I ping my server (rodcet nife), I get no packet loss and can run around
the bazaar as if it was just after a patch. If I don't, I go link dead. I'm
running ping continuously but i realise this is a kludge. My ISP (bigpond
broadband) disabled trace route, allegedly to 'protect' it's users
(firewalled off that port? don't know).

I don't know how many megabytes a day continuous pings eat up but I'm wary
of going over my usage or being treated by EQ as a hacker. Does anyone know
why pinging the rodcet nife server makes my connection so incredibly stable?
I can remember something about it from a decade ago when I studied network
support but i suspect the relevant data was stored in brain cells that died
from lack of use :P

I'm on an ADSL network in sydney. God I wish there was an australian EQ
server! 8-)
