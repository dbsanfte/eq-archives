Then what exactly in EQ does qualify as high-risk, particularly in the 50+
area? Normal exp-grind groups are near-zero risk of death, single or quad
kiting is minimal risk (barring lag/linkdeath, most times you'll die will be
because you either got trained or plain screwed up). High-risk might be the
wrong term, but AE groups are definately more risky than 'normal' ways of
gaining exp.

In your everyday situation, a full group wipeout is rare if you know what
you're doing (at worse, you'll evac). In an AE group, if things start going
wrong wipe-out is seconds away, and noone's going to get an evac off or get
much of a chance to run. 30+ mobs (which is a little extreme, heh) are that
many more things to go wrong than your normal everyday group pulling singles
with the occasional add.

Just because the potential rewards are greater doesn't diminish the risk of
death. Except for raids and special situations (suicide runs doing the
Concussion quest, for instance), few people will get into a situation where
they are likely to lose more exp than they gain.
