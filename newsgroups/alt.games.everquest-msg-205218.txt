Seems to me if I'm going to sacrifice a spell slot to this buff, or to keep
swapping it in, and bothering to keep casting it every 6 minutes or so, I'll
want to know its doing some good.

Using /pet report health, it -does- stack with Alacrity and HOS, I simply
can't say which if any of its effects is stacking.  I can say thus far I
haven't noticed any difference in the pet's damage output from use of this
spell
