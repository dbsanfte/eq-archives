Ah, gotcha. I wish I was enjoying EQ1 more than I am these days...57 was the 
highest I'd gotten a character, would love to get one higher, but...I played 
my new shaman Friday night, and was so bored...just kept thinking the whole 
time, 'Y'know, I could be playing WoW.' I hate that my enjoyment of WoW is 
taking away from what I used to like about EQ1, but...at the same time, I 
like what WoW has to offer, so I'll most likely end up cancelling my EQ 
account and will never get a character higher than 57.
