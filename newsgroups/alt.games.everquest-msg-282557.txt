I think because for a lot of people it made the XP rate cross the
threshold from "this will take a while but I can grind it" to "wow I can
see improvements already".  If the dings keep coming before your boredom
threshold is reached, I think it pushes that boredom threshold back a
bit. Another ding quickly, keep playing even longer, etc. We are truly
Pavlovian creatures.

I'm not ashamed to say I ground my heart out this weekend, way way more
than I would normally do. Got a ton of experience on multiple
characters. I did frequently think of the exact points you made - if I
could do all this in one double XP weekend, it would actually only take
me two normal weekends. But then my wife would probably kill me. I will
probably spend extra time with her now, until she gets sick of it and
shoos me back to the computer. ;)

I was thinking maybe an optimal experience multiplier would be 1.6 to
1.7 - doubling the experience changed the situation from having not
enough people XPing and having difficulties finding groups, to having so
many people XPing there was trouble finding a good place to kill. Need
to find a balance. :)
