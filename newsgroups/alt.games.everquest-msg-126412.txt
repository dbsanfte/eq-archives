Hmmn, I will test tonight to see if I can determine exactly what, if any,
effects it has having a Mino Horn equipped.

I must admit at the moment I was running ander an assumption, that being a

had further assumed the penalty would be resist rate based too. Of course
running on assumptions is a very dangerous thing to do in EQ....
