1hb and piercing are very useful work on them when you can. You will find
cheaper 1hb and Piercers are available than equivalent 1hs weapons (using a
Crystallized Spider fang, 10/22 and CoT 11/25 nowadays) skills go up a
little slowly when you can only improve them while grouping (Solo'ing a blue
at 47th is not a smart idea with weapons you are not familiar with) and I
often have to switch back to my 2hs to make sure I keep aggro on me.
I have worked on H2H a little but not to any great degree, I'll be happy to
get it to 100.
I haven't bothered at all with throwing but archery goes up steadily due to
all the pulling (not far off 200 now)

Told you you'd catch me soon.
Kind of given up on levelling atm and trying to learn smithing. Got fed up
trying to get groups in DL, where it used to be simple it isn't quite so at
the times I want to play, ah well...
