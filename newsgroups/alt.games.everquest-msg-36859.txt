Not sure, but I think it's "sow."

I have a gnome enchanter.  He's grumpy.  He's pretty much based on me in RL.

Friends ask for "crack" and think it's somehow, in the slightest way, funny.
But, I have manners and I don't bite their heads off, but you can bet your
ass it annoys me to no end (especially being as anti-drug as I am).  If
friends called my character a "chanter," it's not quite as stupid so I'm
even less likely to go on the offensive.

I don't recall ever turning down a group that was looking for a "chanter"
when I was looking for work.  Or, for that matter, a "crack dealer" (even
less funny).  But yeah, if I get 2 invites from 2 strangers the one with
better manners will more than likely get me in their group.
