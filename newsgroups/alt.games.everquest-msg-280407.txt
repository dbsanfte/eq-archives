Doing the math. 
Assuming 80% bonus for full group you'd get 55% of the xp as a raid. 
(100:180 = 55%)

Rotating characters on the other hand will give you 85% of the 
character. (basically 100% of the bonus xp minus spending 1/7th of your 
time getting 0%)

So rotating characters will cost you 15% vs 45% for raiding. That's a 
pretty brutal difference. The only draw back to rotating is the hassle 
of micromanagement. 

In either case you will probably make better xp with 6 people instead of 
7. :(
