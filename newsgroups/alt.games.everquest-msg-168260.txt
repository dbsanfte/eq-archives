Several of the halfling newbie armour quests require a Pristine Thorn
Drakeling scale. The TD is a unique spawn (spawns a couple of times
per game day) and the Pristine scales are a rare drop; my understanding
is something like a 1% drop rate. I never saw one myself.

Ruined scales (from the same MOB) are used by several other armour quests
and are a common drop (though the MOB is still rare).

In the end I gave up, but I still nuke thorn drakelings when passing
through Misty Thicket in the hope that I'll find one some day.
