  I've got to agree with you, George.  I remember
how amazed I was when FV, an new, non split server
opened up.  I was on at day one, hour one, and no
one was above level one yet.  It was impossible for
anyone to have made any money yet.  And still.... piles
and piles of rotting dead bat and orc pawn bodies
everywhere.  True, the higher level you get to the
more money you make, so going for exp over loot 
makes sense, but still... One would think they
would at least be trying to save up enough to buy a 
backpack.
   I always clean up my bodies, out of force of 
habit.  Even if I destroy the loot.  Which I
rarely do, unless it will make me overweight.
Keep Norrath beautiful, and all that.
