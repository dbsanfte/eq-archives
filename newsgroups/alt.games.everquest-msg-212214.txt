    Not the only reason. Obsolete loot also plays a part.

    It's one of the draws, though. If I told you that I get an AA point
every 50 minutes in a normal group in Plane of Earth, that doesn't make you
want to be in Plane of Earth?

    They try to match ZEM to risk of death these days. Doesn't always work,
but that's the theory.

    ZEM on PoP zones was reduced from "profane" to "still better than any
alternative", was done after the expansion had been out for some time, and
was done at the same time as a general XP bonus was handed out. LoY zones,
at 85, have a better ZEM than most other non-PoP zones in the same level
range. They also contain several No Drop components for quests that yield No
Drop spells, there's some No Drop spell research items there, an improved No
Drop horse, until the opening of the planes patch it was the only source of
charms (all of which were, wait for it, No Drop).... LoY had plenty of
"hooks" to draw folks in.
