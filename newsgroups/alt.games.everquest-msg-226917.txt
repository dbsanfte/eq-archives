    I agree with all of the responses so far, so I won't bore you by reciting
the same things.  However, I would like to add that if in future you do make the
necessary choice to let someone die so that the group as a whole won't wipe,
don't let it faze you if they aren't gracious about it.

   I had a situation once in Runnyeye where the wizard nuke early and hard.  I
was able to keep him alive for a while using HoT spells, but during one overpull
I got low on mana.  I could keep healing him, or keep the MA alive.  I wished I
could have saved them both, but that simply wasn't possible.  So when he got
agro again, I made the logical choice.  

    He ran around the group when he realized that I wasn't going to pull his
chestnuts out, screaming "Heal!  Heal now!  NOW!"  I'm sure he would have said
more, but he fell mid sentence.  After the fight was over and I medded up, I
rezzed him back in.  In groupsay, I said "Sorry that you died, but I didn't have
enough mana to keep both of you alive."  He spent the next ten minutes
commenting about how much it sucked that he died.  He implied that it was his
job to nuke, and my job to keep EVERYONE alive.  "It sure would have been nice
if EVERYONE had done their job.  This really sucks."

   Ok, I didn't have a 90% or even a 75% rez, but then, we were in a dungeon and
in our 30's, how much exp did he really lose?  The funny thing is, the more he
complained, the less bad I felt about it.

    Anyways, yeah, us clerics (well, those of us who strive to be good clerics)
do want to be able to keep everyone alive.  But as it has been said, that is not
our job.  We are to keep the group from wiping if possible, and that does mean
we have to make some harsh choices sometimes.   Yes, it can be the hardest part
of our jobs.  But it is absolutely needed.
