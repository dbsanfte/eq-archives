OK, I want to buy a pair of the new boots in Sol A. I am tired of camping
the AC, only to have a Wizard or some "733+ d00d" guild KS me.

So I have the cash, that isn't the problem. The hassle is that I am an
Erudite Shadow Knight. I am NOT KOS to the clockwork guards or natives of
Ak'anon. But I am VERY KOS to the Gnomish Miners. And I have never, ever,
ever killed a gnome. Ever. Or a clockwork, other than a rogue. So, other
than hunting in Nag's lair, where can I go to improve my faction standing?
