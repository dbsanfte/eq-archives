Hi Doctorzoid.  I think I might have seen you in the Cave in EC, (if you go
by Doctorsomethingorother).
I sit and watch the spawns at night, help with minor heals from my Cleric or
Paladin on the edge of the enterance,
and get a few kills when the Skellies break from the train.  I am not strong
enough to fight them on the field of battle yet.
Friben is my Paladin and Frieben is my Cleric.

Happing hunting ... Ben
