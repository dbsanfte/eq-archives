No.  Most faction in EQ is adjustable by player actions.  Faction
requirements generally translate into time requirements.  So the
intent is that the already epic'd Shaman should have to put in
significant time doing faction work to do the MQ with another,
rather than just being able to do it at a whim, possibly even
multiple times (do you smell the out of game $$ yet?).
