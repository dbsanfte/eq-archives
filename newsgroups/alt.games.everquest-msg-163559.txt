Well that is my beef essentially.  That right now you need to be in one
of the top two guilds on a server (for the most part, I am sure there
are exceptions) to have a reasonable shot at 63/64 spells and by that I
mean have access to third tier planes.  The best camp for them before
HoH is the consorts in PoN, and the drop rate there is *maybe* 2 every 3
hours, best case.  Really its probably closer to 1 every 2 hours, per
group.  And its pretty much camped 24/7.  Some other stuff in PoN can
drop them, and some stuff outside of PoN can, but the drop rate gets
even worse and we still arent talking about a lot of places.  But my
pals who were flagged for HoH are soloing mobs and getting 1 an hour to
themselves!  Thats insanely frustrating.  Now they have nerfed the
drops, and I sure as hell didnt want that, I expected that they would
expand the spectrals outside of pre-HoH areas.  Give them a chance to
drop from any 63+ mob, something like that.

Well I dont know what you mean.  It seems strange that some level 62-3
stuff can drop them but then level 65 stuff cant, in the same zone.  Or
even across zones.  I am sure Verant doesnt have a handle on drop rates
and whats good and what isnt.  I think they missed the mark totally with
spells.  The turn in system is ok, as it means you wont get spells no
class can use, but the drop rates are sorry.

OK up to 59 were on vendors for all classes.  But this is even different
than that.  The rate is even more restricted.

Chottal wasnt a special effort, I mean the crypt wasnt that hard with
cler/enc/war and you could single pull him with annul.  All the other
stuff, I agree with you was tough.  But you could also get 59/60s off of
the GWs in Skyfire which were not that hard to kill with 2 groups.  Yes
I assume you have some 60s in that mix, but the comparison is still
valid.  And even though there were some very restricted/hard to get
spells in Kunark, each casting class had a lot of spells on vendors.
There was a reason to level up, you had spells waiting for you.  PoP,
that isnt the case.

Well we agree here, thats refreshing.

Thats fine and I agree with that statement.  I still disagree with
putting a weapon better than some classes epics on mobs that can be
solod.

Either way, I think the HoH situation is/was messed up.  Because you are
in a top guild you get to farm 63/64 spells (acquiring them with minimal
effort and more commonly than a peon in lowered rank guild can even get
61/62 spells) and items that sell for 20K and drop like candy?  Thats
not right.

I am sorry I jumped the gun and I didnt mean to attack you.  I am just
bitter.  I would imagine though, that even if you personally do not have
acess to HoH, you have benefited from your guildmates that do.

I understand that EQ has always been designed for the most hardcore to
be able to get more stuff, and kill more stuff, than those with less
time or those who put in less effort.  But this is different than past
expansions.  With PoP someone in the top 1-2 guilds on the server
probably has access to 50% more high level content than the person
without.  We are not just talking a one zone advantage like VP or VT.
We are talking lots of zones.  On top of that, if you are not a caster
in an uber guild you are fucked right now for your spells.  I think
thats bullshit and thats what I am pissed about.  I will stop bitching
when and if I get my spells, but I am never going to think they made a
good decision with the way content, and spells, are being handled right
now.
