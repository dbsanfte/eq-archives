I was hunting in The Grey with my Enchanter, and using Water Elemental as
the Enduring Breath solution.

I camped out, thinking that when I logged back in - I'd have enough time
before the breath bar ran out to recast the illusion.

Well I was in for a nice surprise - upon logging in I was choking and
already down to half health.

Died very soon after - when you lose 170hp per tick, and you've not got much
to start with - you tend not to last real long.

I guess the moral of this is - get yourself an Enduring Breath Item and
never ever rely on a spell or illusion.
