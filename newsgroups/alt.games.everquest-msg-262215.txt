    One of the druids in my guild has that issue, same as the one that hit 
me during PoP. It's been since late Sunday and CS still hasn't gotten back 
to him. When it happened to me, it took a GM who was allowed to alter levels 
maybe 15 minutes total to verify the issue and correct the problem. The 
druid is understandably pissed off.
