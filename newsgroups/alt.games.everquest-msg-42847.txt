Sounds like how I picked my first character, except I wanted a good
race elven healer, went through elf faces, didn't like the high elves,
hated the half elves, and settled on the green eyed red lipped
brunette wood elf face for my druid. If high elves had appealed to me,
I would have been a cleric.

My warrior looks like you :)
