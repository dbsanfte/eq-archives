If you go back and check his initial message, you'll see he notes that his
main character is new to the guild, but one of his alts helped form it. It
is his guild as much as it is theirs, and in some cases (post-formation
members), moreso. He would, in essence, be attempting to change a guild he
helped form.

That said, you are correct that in such situations (new guy to guild),
things could go sour.
