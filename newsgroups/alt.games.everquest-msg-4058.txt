True but it will be done equally by all three sides.  I am positive,
absolutely positive that at some point playing DAoC someone will say
"Hey I'm going to lure a party to x spot in Z realm and we ambush
them".  There are a couple things though. Either they are in my realm
in which case they are already under more threat purely from wandering
players who can shout their loc in a heartbeat. Or they are in their
realm or the neutral areas in which case the party planning the ambush
will be risking themselves to do the ambush.  Also since most raids
and travel into enemy territory will occur at high level it would
pretty much require a high level plant to get the ambush. If these
things are common then anyone who is on a few of these things will
hopefully get a rep.  Well see I suppose but It doesn't really concern
me.

True.   I guess we will see as the game goes on how effective this
tactic is and how much of a problem it becomes. One thing for sure
though it will sure sell more accounts for Mythic.
