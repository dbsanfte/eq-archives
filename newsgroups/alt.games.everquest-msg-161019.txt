No exp.  You need the numerical exp that a 51 needs to ding real exp (Or
something close to that), but the rate that you gain it is based on your
current level.  If it's green, the fight is considered too trivial to gain
exp.

At 60, it seems to be a toss-up.  You have the widest "blue range" of any
player, and can hunt pretty much anywhere.   The best exp will be in the
planes, but you can have a lot of fun and gain "decent" exp in the newly
uncrowded Sebilis, Velks, Chardok, Howling Stones.  (When I was checking on
Doomshade last night, there were only 2 soloing druids in Umbral Plains for
almost the full hour.  Compared to the 80 people pre-PoP.)

I honestly don't know if it would have been better to stay 60 and hunt in
them a lot, and the planes sometimes.  If you're going all out planar, no
reason not to level though, and you will still gain massive AA in the new
zones.  (I'm now 61, and still limited mostly to Tier 1 planes, but I'm
gaining AA twice as fast in terms of blue bubbles per hour as I was at
60....  and thats even with diverting 40 percent to real exp, instead of 10
percent... so maybe 3 times as fast AA)

One of the issues is that if you have a regular hunting group... it would
almost have to be a group decision.  Since if even one of your regular
hunting partners dings 61... suddenly the whole group can't go a lot of
places.  That person would be unhappy with the exp they were getting, and
the whole group would likely have to move.

The new zones do seem to have a lot of room for many groups to fit in, but I
still mourn the loss of many of my favorite exp zones.   Little was more fun
than cutting your way down into the depths of Chardok or moving through to
just outside of Drusilla's Chamber in the final wing of Howling Stones.  And
none of the new zones I've seen so far seem to be the dungeon type
environment I enjoy....  *shrug*

Some of us got flagged for the Lair of Terris Thule the other night.   So
hopefully our guild will soon have enough done to start some exp groups in
that sub zone, but I guess we'll see.
