This seems to be lowered.  I was in a group a few days ago, in
Overthere, where the puller constantly brought in more than one mob.

I had to tell them to make sure all mobs were injured a bit at first,
before they started to concentrate on one.  After that, I had no
trouble casting multiple Superior Healings during the fights.

Damage shields help also.

At this level (35) casters do not have too much hitpoints, even when I
cast Valor and Symbol on them, so they can easily be healed with Valor
(170 hitpoints or so), because using a Superior healing on them would
waste much mana.
