Yes, the spires were camped to the hilt on Xev too. However, when we said
"screw it" and just went down into Paw itself, we found all *sorts* of Tech Mas
running about to kill. Taking a while to get the hang of fighting in there
without getting into trouble but the cleric made over half a level there in one
session and probably would have dinged already had we not both stupidly died
once. I think we may stay. :-)  That dungeon bonus is just too nice.

Yes, I went from 30 to 35 in a combination of sessions either on the ledge in
OT or at the giant fort in FM. Sadly, my cleric friend seems somewhat paranoid
about Kunark, so I'm looking for old world or Vellious options. Our next stop
may still well be the Kodiak caves in GD.
