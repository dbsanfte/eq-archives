Fighting a dark blue solo, and getting about 1- 1.5 blue per kill is
what I call GOOD experience. I am making that on some of the higher
level goblins in High Keep (when I'm not farming guards for fine steel
weapons and coin).

Of course I play a semi-twinked 39 dorf warrior with an iksar
ceremonial chestplate so I can reduce my downtime tremendously.
