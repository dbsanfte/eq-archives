BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING....

    Those adjustable coils he mentioned in the previous post should be
adjusted with plastic tools (Radio Shack probably sells them).  Using a
metal screwdriver can change the inductance while you're tuning, giving you
a false image.  In addition, you do risk knocking your monitor further out
of whack, regardless of the tools.  Most techs have a signal generator they
use to get a test signal, then adjust to that.  Guessing seldom works well.
    Some electronic repair shops have picture tube regenerators...they can
give you a temporary improvement if the CRT is going bad.  But it won't last
long, and will shorten the amount of life you do have left in the monitor.
