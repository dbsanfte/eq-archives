Absolutely correct so far.

No, *you* can always get exp no matter how low some of the
group members may be.  *They* on the other hand won't get
exp unless they are at least 2/3 of your level (or more
accurately, 2/3 of the level of the highest person in the
group).  It's just the flip-side of the "1.5" rule.  Dividing
by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by 2/3.

Example:  I'm level 55.  A level 1 person joins the group.
I still get exp, but they sure as hell won't.  Anyone
in my group needs to be 55*2/3 = 36.6 (okay, "37") or above
in order to get any exp as long as I'm in the group.

The high-end people always get a share of the exp, because
they're doing most of the work.  It's the low-end people
which may be cut out of the experience pie because the
game considers them "too low" to actually be helping the
rest of the group.

Nope, see above.  You are never penalized for having low,
even very low, people in the group.  You will still get exp.

The reason things work this way is so that low-level people
can't gain exp insanely fast by joining up with a high-level
group.  Otherwise, a level 20 person could join a group of
people at levels 50+, and ding a level every few minutes.

Not only would this make things "too easy", it wouldn't
be realistic --the level 20 person would be contributing
very, very little to the actual kills, and thus they
truly have earned little or no "experience" at killing
monsters.  They're just being carried along for the ride.


> Is this how power-leveling works?

No.  Because of the level-limit in a group, powerleveling
is usually done by having the lowbie outside of any group.
Then a bunch of high-level characters does everything it
can to help him plow through monsters fast, like buff him
up, keeping him continuously healed, and wiping out the
monster when it's below 50% health (because the lowbie
has done 51% or more of the damage, he gets *all* of the
experience when the creature dies, even if the high-level
people crush it to death with one blow to finish off the
last 49% of its health).

There are more sophisticated ways to do it, but that's
the basic idea.  The key, though, is that the person
being powerleveled can't actually be grouped with
the high-level people, or else he gets nothing, zero,
zip, nada in the way of experience.
