I've heard they've made it more single-group friendly.  Possibly just a 
rumor.  Wondering what the changes are going to do with respect to the 
rotation system on Karana (I still need my SEoC out of here).

Should see this on the poor people servers in like a month?  Seem to 
recall that's about when the new Hate went live on Stormhammer.

I'm really happy with LoY in general (fun zones with good XP for my alts 
and decent loot!), and the map system in particular.  Of course, I don't 
actually make any maps, I just use the ones from maps.eq-toolbox.com.  
Kinda wishing there was a way to only display particular layers by 
default though.  Gets annoying having to click off the base layer every 
time I zone into a zone where SOE has provided a map as well.

Glad to see they made this disableable.  With all the other new popup 
confirmation boxes, it sounds like some of the older players may get a 
bit annoyed when they roll a new alt.

Woot!  Wonder if they've taken away the initial 5 training points we get 
though...

Sounds like a good change.  Haven't been in many situations where DI was 
used and no idea what it even does :P

Well, there goes half the fun of grouping with epic bards!  I know quite 
a few people who will be happy about this change though.

I'd rather see how much who is healing for on other characters.  "Bob has 
been healed by Ralph for 5380 points of damage."  Don't think it would 
work without the numbers except in the case of cheal: "Bob has been 
completely healed by Ralph."  When you think about it, why not let 
everybody see how much the tank is being healed for?  Excess spam?  11 
words instead of 4?

Granted, I haven't done much fear kiting lately, but I didn't have a 
problem landing ensnare on a feared rat in PoD last time I did tried it.

But since the non-PC illusions no longer change faction, how was this 
being used to grief?  "wtf, you cast levitate on me!"

Grats clerics.  Having a discussion on guild boards re: enchanter nerf.  
A cleric was whining about how they've been nerfed into oblivion and he 
was thinking he should start playing another class.  The only two "bad" 
things I recall happening to clerics in the past 15 months (since I 
started playing and therefore paying attention at all) are that cheal 
dropped from 10k to 7500hp, and they gave druids and to a lesser extent 
shaman a couple big heals much later on in the game.  This should 
probably go in its own thread, but what gives?  I *never* see a cleric 
LFG for more than 10 minutes on Karana, while pre-58 druids can go for 
hours without getting a group ("go solo!"  some druids don't like to 
solo).  When were clerics really hit by the nerf bat last (something on 
the order of what's happened to monks, wizards and the charming classes 
(enchanters in particular) in the last year)?

I find it annoying that procs prevent me from casting on my Ranger when 
they go off.  They're instantaneous (although I did have CallOfFireEffect 
interrupted for the first time yesterday), why gray out my spells?

This was probably the "was struck by a sudden force" change that went

Noob question time: What spells outside of Gift of Magic/KEI/Tranq/VoQ 
add raw mana?  I notice that Gather Mana was increased from 5k to 10k, is 
this what they're talking about?

A great big "woot" ;)

Brings up a question I have about some stuff I've seen coming out of 
PoTime that has FT3 (Combat) on it like it's a proccing bracer.  Anybody 
have some insight on that?

A boon to those who forget to hit "combine" on their quest containers.

I really wish they would let us stack items on our cursors like this with 
normal spell casts.  Examples: enchanting metals or summoning arrows.  If 
you cast multiple times without putting the item into inventory you end 
up with only one.

I've spent the past two days trying to get the key for this zone done.  
I've got all of 4 pieces, including the Trak's Tooth that I won that's 
making me feel obligated to complete the damn thing.  People spend less 
time camping Stormfeather.  /sigh.

I really hope this isn't bugged.  We're looking at going through this

Good change here I think.  Though it probably won't affect most people 
who were already using a UI mod with it in there.  Been thinking about 
adding that to my target window anyway.

Good change here.  What I'd really like to see is a dialog box that shows 
what's being sent along with the option to send or not so that you can 
make sure you have it right before you send it.

Really wishing they had implemented this like they did with held 
containers (mixing bowls, jewelcrafting kits, etc) and just made a big 
bright yellow message come up in the chat window.  Now it's an extra 
click just to get back to the incessant clicking that already takes place

Never actually run into this issue, but I suppose it helps newbies or

...the window was already remembering my settings...  Good change with
