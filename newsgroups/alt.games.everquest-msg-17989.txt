It really all depends on what you want to do.  Druids have more offencive
spells, and can solo very well, Clerics however are allways in demand, I
turn off the anon and I am getting tells to come help people across the
world, and they will come and get me.  Clerics are very hard to play, you
turn your head from the screen  for a moment and someone can die, there is a
lot of stress involved.  The cleric usually takes command of the party also,
so good leadership skills are also a plus.    Everyone is a druid it seems
like, but there are very fiew clerics expecially at the higher lvls and a
good cleric is almost impossable to find.   Clerics cannot beat there way
out of a wet paper sack, and absolutely need a group to be with, a bad group
will get you killed also so be carefull, but at lvl one you get divine aura,
that should be the first spell you spend money on and have it allways up, it
has seved my life more times that I can count, 18 seconds is usually enough
time to run screaming to the zone in most places.

advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of
your walks."
