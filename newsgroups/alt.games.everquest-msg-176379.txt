Correct.  So, instead of joining the "mash mob", use Taunt when you
don't have agro, and when you (a) have just leveled and are spending
a minute or two maxing it, (b) have just seen a caster land a high
agro offensive spell or big heal (you might no longer be at the top
of the hate list when this happens), (c) when the mob tries to peel
off you to get at a caster.  Case (c) is the reason you don't want
to be just another mindless masher, if you're constantly mashing the
button you've got roughly a 10% chance of Taunt being available more
or less instantly (within 1/2 second), and if you don't Taunt the
mob instantly it <will> close with the caster and commence giving
him the beating he so richly deserves.

Yes.  Hybrids who don't figure this out steadily lose popularity at
higher levels, especially with the Clerics ("so sorry I didn't notice
your health dropping, I was concentrating on the MT").  In fact,
Paladins and SKs generally hold off on hate-intensive actions until
and unless they need to get agro, i.e. when the MT falls, or an add
needs to be intercepted, or the mob breaks off the MT and goes for
casters (this last is situational, sometimes the best people to
handle this are the casters themselves, see some of Bergh's old
comments on the relationship between a Cleric and an Enchanter).

Your attitude is good and your ideas are basicly sound.  I can think
of no better foundation to ensure that you learn good tactics when
you play the character.
