Non disclosure standard agreement.
Any of the 100 people picked to be in it
probably are not going to screw that up
publically. They could easily trace it back to
which beta tester did it.

Besides that I think they said that before you hear anything 
to take it with a grain of sallt. The public people testing
are using something a generation or more behind the private
in house testers. Stuff the public tests is more like wider variety of
hardware bugs and eventually, with open beta tests, server stress.
