I would second the CoD guess, and also the recommendation.

The single player is a bit short but it is very challenging even on lower
levels so I would expect that the 24 missions on higher levels would be
hard work (especially the tank ones). Multiplayer is, well to me its
excellent but if you weren't fond of counterstrike I'd suggest a try
before you buy if you can. THe multiplay, while it can include mad
deathmatch, is based on objective driven play and on destroy, capture etc
missions you can end up 20 seconds in dead from a bullet you didnt see and
sitting out the next 5 minutes. If that in CS was annoying, look first.
