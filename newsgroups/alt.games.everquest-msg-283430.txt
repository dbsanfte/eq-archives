Yes - the way I understand it, is if you have leaderXP on, that will
get the first chunk of XP (20% or so).

Then whatever is left gets split up in your "normal XP / AAXP"
percentage that you choose, so if you choose 100% AAXP, the remaining
80% will go into that.

You'll still get leader XP regardless of what % XP/AAXP you have set
up until you shut it off and/or max it out.
