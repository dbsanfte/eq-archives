Assuming you trust the /con data.  I noticed a couple of oddities.

1. There were a lot of corpses with exactly 3 hours to rez.  Even if
you die and camp out as soon as you get back in, some time should be
gone from the timer.  I suppose people could have went LD, and died
while LD...but this was in EC, not some raid zone, and there were a
*lot* or corpses this way.

2. I found a corpse with 163 hours left on the rez timer.

A useful experiment to try would be when someone dies, check to make
sure the rez timer is going down, then have them try logging off and
on in different ways.  E.g., see if the problem many people have seen
with "/camp desktop" making the rez timer run out faster can be
proven.
