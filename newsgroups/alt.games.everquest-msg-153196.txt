It was my understanding that after a lot of complaints from players after
the 'nerf' it was 'un-nerfed' - The statement *I* read after a patch said
that experience was now at 'least' what it was before they changed it, but
those players that chose to fight higher level mobs (assumably in groups)
would get a bonus ..

Safe hunting,
