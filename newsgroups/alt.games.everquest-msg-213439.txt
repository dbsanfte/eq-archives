You know, if you're REALLY stubborn, you could camp the Ancient Cyclops in South Karana.
I wouldn't hold your breath for the spawn.

I actually encountered him some time ago.  Unfortunately, I was *way* too young for the
battle.   As I started my CR from WFP, I rallied the troops (some 45-or-so friends who
were farming in RM).  By the time we convened in the NW corner of SK, the AC had either
despawned or been taken down by a tracking class.
