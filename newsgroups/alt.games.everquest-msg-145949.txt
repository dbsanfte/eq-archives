It may come as a shock to you, but 'warrior' is considered a 'melee'
character, and cleric are considered a 'priest' class. Your job is to
heal and buff, sad to say. Show me a warrior who can do -that- job as
well as you can, and I'll listen to you too.

Soak damage? 
Solo and small/easy groups you've got us beat there too, by virtue of
your comparable AC and HPs (you can selfbuff to the level of a
selfbuffed warrior) and difference in mitigation is more than negated by
the fact you can heal yourself midfight with ease in this type of
encounter.

Hold Agro? 
Solo and small/easy groups you've got us beat there yet again. Root and
Chain stun for a start. You can also supply enough healing to keep
ANYONE standing in this type of encounter.

So, out of the 4 main areas of the game (solo, easy group, tough group,
raid) half of them a cleric can do a warrior's job comparatively without
hurting the group too much. Show me how a warrior can do a cleric's job
in those types of groups.

Don't get me wrong, clerics needed these changes, but as every other
class is tuned/improved in effectiveness in multiple areas, the warrior
just slips further and further behind relatively. The new effects on VT
items for example, are just huge compared to ANY single item increase
for a melee type. 30% reduction on mana cost for 95% of spells is
equivalent to +1200 mana and stackable FT4.5 on a single item, compared
to a melee's potential increase max of 50-75hps per item upgrade. Even
the melee holy grail of vengeance has only a very small dps increase on
a warrior.
