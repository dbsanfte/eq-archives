Takes a while for the documentation and spoilers to filter down and be
propogated all over. Yes, there are people there. Our guild has had
scouting parties hitting the various non-epic level "higher level" zones
already, finding good pulling spots, mapping dungeons in a ways, etc.
And we've run into parties from other guilds in all of them. I woulnd't
call any of it massively overcrowded yet (Except mayb FG which all the
55+ have locked onto like radar) but they are being used. Plenty of loot
has been posted on our guild boards. (Nothing *that* exciting yet.)

It will all come in time.
