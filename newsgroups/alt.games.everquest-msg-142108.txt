What you've described are IC views of the classes IC roles. When we're
talking what should be done game-mechanics wise and what should not,
IC view of those roles is irrelevant. You look at the roles from an
OOC perspective, not from the perspective of a character within the
world. Your argument against shamans/druids being closer to clerics
doesn't hold up when you remove the IC bias of looking at the classes
as a member of a society where clerics are the religious leaders.

And, as has been pointed out, the "lower" CHeal isn't as powerful as
the cleric's, so even then it still fits with their role. Being "pure"
casters in general, they definately should be more advanced than the
melee caster hybrids.
