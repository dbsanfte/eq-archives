Or, for something a bit more exciting -

Make sure you're SoW'd - yay for potions!  Find a cyclops that's near a
second one, target it at max range, and hit it with your best charm.  As
soon as the cyc is charmed, the other will attack it.  Let both cyclopses
get down to about 50% health, then slow your target.  Your pet should kill
his opponent when he's down to about 15% health.  If the target is dying too
fast, you might have to dispell it.  Break charm and he's a runner - nuke
him down, loot both corpses, voila!

If the cyclopses are too far apart, you'll want to target the second one and
/pet attack (or use suitable hotkey).  This is a safe, easy introduction to
charm soloing.
