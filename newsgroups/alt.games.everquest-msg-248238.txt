They end up creating deviating code bases with duplicate and deviating
structures along with double maintanance fees every time they fart and
want to change one thing. They may save themselves in development of
the product but fuck themselves in the support of it. Hence... /wave
mac version.

When they get serious about being a 21st century software corporation
they won't make such stupid shit. The fact is this... you should be
able to download the mac version of the EQ software.. run the client..
login.. and go. Just like you do on the PC. Anything short of that is
a hack and a waste of time.
