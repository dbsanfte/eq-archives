That is what I always thought, but this happened last night:

2 people are camping Hadden.  He pops, they take him down pretty quickly (
lead with a 700pt Harmtouch, from what I could gather ), but before he goes
down, Rephas charms the Lvl 50 Shadowknight ( makes no sense to me how a guy
that low can charm a lvl 50, but that's beside the point ).  The SK kills
her pet, and then charm breaks.  Rephas, his pet, the SK, and the Druid that
was there helping ( husband / wife team ) are all withing pinching distance
of each other - and it just gets quiet.  Rephas didn't attack anyone.  His
pet was just idling.

The 3 of us all simultaneously said some form of "WTF?"  It was quite eerie.

Why did Rephas and his pet stop?  The druid hadn't attacked Rephas, but had
whomped on Hadden.  Same with the SK that got charmed.
