Nope. Takes at least 4 members in your group to get an adventure
assigned. I suppose if the other 3 logged after getting the adventure,
you could go in solo...but it'd be a pain to do the mission.

I seriously doubt you'll have a lot of trouble finding groups to go
into LDoN dungeons...

>So you need 3 other people at least?

Yup

>Any features only it gives you, besides the group instanced content?

Aside from the augmentation slots and gems, not really. But the
instanced dungeons are great. :p

>Are the augmentation addition stones or whatever NO DROP?

I haven't seen many (didn't spend much time in the beta), but all I
did see were no drop. Some dev comments suggest that there are
droppable ones, though. However, those might be higher "type"
augmentation items (they're divided into 3 or 4 categories, and item
slots specify what category augmentation they can take), and certain
categories will only be available on LDoN (and possibly future
expansion) loot.
