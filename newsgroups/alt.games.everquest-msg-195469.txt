To the anecdotal point I listed, that you snipped.

Agreed.

I could really care less about the L25 soloing instead of grouping.  Soloing
v. grouping has never been that big of a deal to me.  My bone regarding that
is that if you start with KEI early on you never really learn your class'
limitations, because at low levels there are essentially no limitations when
you're buffed with KEI.

As I mentioned earlier in the thread (I think it was this thread), my
problem with a mid-range having it is that they tend to run onto a hunting
ground and pull the whole place rather than sharing spawns.  And at times,
they try to use "I have a KEI, I just want to get my money's worth" as a
justification.  That arguement goes over like a turd in a punchbowl, at
least insofar as I'm concerned.

Not having a chanter high enough to have KEI, I can't really speak to the
second point.
