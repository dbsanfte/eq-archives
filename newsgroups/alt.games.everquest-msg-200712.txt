This is why I posed my question in another thread called "Bards: The
most overpowered class in Everquest?"  I only have a level 47 Bard and
even though I can't do more DoT damage than a Necro (at my level), I
think I can get faster XP within an hour because I really don't use
all that much mana for my charm song.  I remember one morning I was
charm kiting six Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains and I drew a crowd of
on-lookers.  Of course, they were probably sitting there waiting for
me to die so they could take the giants I was fighting.  After 15
minutes all six were dead and I made around 150pp.  One giant dropped
as much as 49pp and a few others dropped as little as 2pp.  It took me
15 minutes (which is long for only 6 mobs) cause the HG's in Rathe
have a tendency to run off when they are charmed instead of coming
right to me.
