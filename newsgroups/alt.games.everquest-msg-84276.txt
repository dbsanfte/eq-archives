True. I do not place the blame entirely on the original poster.  My
point of view is more of that guild and player should be compatable- and
in communication with each other. Both player and guild should be
helping each other, and communication is vital for any healthy
relationship.

I ask the porters in my guild if they can help. They ask If I can rez.
If it doesn't work out, it's fine. No hard feelings. That's what saying
NO is for. 

All guilds should have a purpose. A player seeking a guild should be
compatible with that purpose- whther it's Flowers of Happiness, or a
genuinely helpful, family-style guild like mine, or a guild focused
entirely on Uber raids. If you do not find a guild that meets *your*
purposes, and don't join a guild- Good for you. Play like you want to
play. But if you are commited to a guild, be as committed to it, as it
should be to you.

Frankly, it did not sound like the OP was a good fit for his guild. So
now, he has a chance to find something that suits him better. Good luck
to him.

I was incorrect in these statements. One can be /guildremoved by any
officer in any zone.
