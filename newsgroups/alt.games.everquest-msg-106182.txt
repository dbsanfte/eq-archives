No I'm pretty sure that's not right.  Haste does not mean you do more damage
per swing.  It means you finish swinging sooner  Or you could say that you
swing more times in a given time frame.  A 20% haste would mean that you
finish the 10 swings 20% faster.  Which means that if for example it took
you 10 seconds to swing 10x unhasted then a 20% haste would have you
finishing those 10 swings in 8 seconds.  Using those 2 extra seconds would
net you 25% more damage (8/2) so you would do 1.25*27.5 = 34.375 damage in
the same time frame.

I haven't actually measured this, and I could be wrong about one thing.  I'm
really not so sure whether a 20% haste means that you finish 20% sooner or
get 20% more swings, which the latter case would mean that you actually do
20% more damage and not 25%.  But I am almost certain that you do not merely
add 20% to the max damage per hit value.

Yea that challenger thing was pretty bad, wasn't it?  <just kidding>
