Lets see, I helped a guild druid camp these and We killed some 20 of them so
far (only had short runs of camping them).
And we've had 2 spell drops and that was Fixation of Ro and WL port.   So my
guess is the spells take up one random slot in the loot table and perhaps
(the statistic base isn't that convincing yet) there is a spelldrop on 10%
of the wurms.
Then divide this by how many different spells the wurms drop (Allakhazam
lists 9 spells on ancient shardwurms).
Giving you an approxiamte chance of 1.11% in getting the specific spell you
want. But as they say you can proove anything with statistics, and I guess
even more with VERY loosely based statistics :)
