Had to recently replace my old GeForce 4 w/ a new GeForceFX 5700 Ultra.
(Thanks to the 25 cent fan on the old card that decided to quit working -
the one *glued* to the GPU.  Thank God for christmas Best Buy gift cards
...)

Anyway, EQ crashes fairly regularly after the install.  No, don't get the
little "we had an error - care to report it?" box - the game just locks up
hard.  Can't even get back to XP; CTRL-ALT-DEL is ignored although hitting
power button still causes shut-off.

Does EQ not play well w/ DX9 + Nvidia 53.03 detonator drivers?  Any way to
regain stability?
