Lake of ill omen is fine at 25. All you need to do is a /pet guard here at a
safe spot, and go (single) pull mobs yourself.
There are a number of safe spots. Ive usually hung around the edge of the
lake on the west near the pillars. Obviously the fm zone is safe. I expect
the windmill is safe too, tho I seldom go over that side of the lake.

When you get to the 30's you can head over to frontier mountains, or maybe
even the Overthere.
