Given how frequently my protestations of being OOM are ignored (and given
that having the cleric OOM is typically a Really Bad Thing) I've been
thinking of setting up a hotkey something like
    /g THE CLERIC IS OUT OF MANA. STOP PULLING OR YOU WILL DIE.
but have so far resisted the temptation.

I do have another hotkey that says, in various ways, that it's time to
run away.

Being mildly anal I usually ask for a SoW rather than a SOW... but that's
another of those cases where I don't expect others to mirror my own
peculiarities.
