If this is the version of it that you're willing to actually *admit* to
in a public forum, I imagine the language you used in the real
conversation was even worse. But even if not, you were warned
appropriately. Try growing up a bit and familiarizing yourself with the
rules. Try reading that funny EULA thingy you agree to every time you
play. Go to their home page and check out the rules sections available
there.
