Okay.  I see your point.  However, my enchanter has on a couple of occasions
been given a tell from another zone for just that ... only they were asking
for ports!  Not /anon at the time.  /boggle  So, if I can even get a few of
those tells, then I *really* do feel for you druids.  Sounds like a "misery
loves company" attitude towards KEI casting enchanters, though.   :-)
