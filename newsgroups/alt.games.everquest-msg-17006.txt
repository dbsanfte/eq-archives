}Greetings to all,

}Teaching Tolerance project.

I'm sorry, but as a member of the Knights of the Innoruuk Guardian Force, 
I just gotta ask...  Do you really think 'teaching tolerance' is gonna 
help you in the planes?

Our father is mighty.  His hate is strong.  You will crumble before it.  
He has already logged your posting IP.  Do not challenge him, or IGF and 
the Indigo Brotherhood will feed your bloodless corpse to the ghouls.  

Well, we might anyway.  Sounds kinda fun.

Geez, it really is 5:30 AM isn't it?
