Generally people don't wanna hear it. Some groups have people who are
watching a movie while we PL them into LDoN points.

I generally avoid pick ups unless it contains guildies. I depend on a
tank taunting, I have to evade during most fights where the taunt
isn't up there. From the front my DPS goes way down.
