Regarding which mobs do DT this info is spot on. I can't confirm the DT
timer but around one minute sounds ok iirc.
I admit I was speechless a moment when you described your lineup. A 12k
HP tank in fear is nearly invulnerable DT aside. ;) Just go in with your
group and do a normal break in. For Cazic just levitate everybody to
counter his knockback and you're set.
