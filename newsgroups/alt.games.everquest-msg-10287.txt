Had a very productive day going up from level 10 to 13.  Just was wondering
how good a shape my combat skills are in thus far?

1HS - 63
2HS - 47
1HB - 41

I know 2HB and Piercing are worthwhile skills but I really do not have the
patience to put work into two more so I think I will let them be. ;)  I
might reconsider piercing sometime, but 2HB, yuck!
