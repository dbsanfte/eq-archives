Nice try.

Werewolves DON'T have the postulated capability to avoid detection by
a "repeatable verifiable scientifically acceptable proof"... 

unless you've imagined werewolves that can turn it on and off at a
whim with no abnormal biological indicators that could be traced...
but I haven't even heard about *those* werewolves. Mine are all Lunar
reactionary, with caustic problems with silver, and bizzare blood
diseases.

Then again maybe your "werewolves" are simply a biological disorder
causing episodes of unremembered and primally violent behaviour, ... a
sort of doctor jekyll and mr. hyde... and the moon and the silver are
just wives-tales. If that's the case then we do have werewolves...
theres any number of disorders that can manifest like this.
