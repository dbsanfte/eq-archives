I found the YR twice last week on the oasis. I zoned frooom NRO climbed over
the frist hill. There is a long wide flat there staying on the hill, walk to
the end of it (about half way up the valley). He comes from the direction of
the Gsy. Camp. Both times I was able to  get him. The first time I got a
torn yellow sash from him. The last time was attack by sg after I killed
him. I had to leave game so didn't bother to loot him, wished I had just to
see if I got something different. By the way he came by about the same time
of day both times abt. 3 to 4 pm P.S.T.
