Refer to <Conquest>'s logs back when they got disbanded for the
Sleeper's debacle. At the end, one of the GM's was answering them *IN*
guild chat, though nobody noticed at the time. And VI made reference to
comments made in /gu during their "explanation" of the actions taken by
the CS staff.

Indeed, any thoughts of "privacy" in your Norrathian communications are
a fantasy at best. Be careful out there. ;-)
