Bah, Hadden isn't uber, besides, there's plenty of other options for EB
items, particularly the amulet of the grey wastes, that are relatively easy
to get.

The problem with VS/VSR is that they're tied together, so randomizing VS
screws up VSR.
Nowadays you may have nothing but VS for a week (yay pants farmage), before
you finally get a VSR that your guild can handle (as opposed to VS).
