I didn't know you could make that button go away, but I have a couple of 
suggestions.

Did you change your display resolution in the game so that maybe it was 
pushed out of the visible area? I don't know if it actually behaves that 
way or not.

Did you play with the letterbox setting to make the black areas at the top 
and bottom of the display too small, allowing the game view area to cover 
up the button? Again, I don't know if that setting would cause that or not.
