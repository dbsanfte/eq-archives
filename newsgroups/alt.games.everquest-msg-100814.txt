Upgrade memory, re install windows (you play alot of games and that tends to
muck up the OS), turn off Luclin models, turn down the clipping plane and 3D
sky, /showgrass off. That should improve things. As far as video cards go,
it makes a difference but not as much as the memory.
With the above changes you should be fine in all the old zones and maybe
just have problems in a few of the Luclin zones.
