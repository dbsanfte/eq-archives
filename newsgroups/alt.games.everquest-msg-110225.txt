Well, obviously not, since if anyone ever -did- demonstrate the truth of 
an article of faith, it wouldn't be a matter of faith any more, but a mere 
fact.  Now here's the toughie:  prove that it's an article of faith, and 
hence can't be proven.  Until you can absolutely prove that its truth or 
falsehood can never be proven, we've still got something worth arguing 
about. :)
