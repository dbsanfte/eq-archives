    There's a neat new item out of Acrylia that might be more to his fancy
than Goranga, seeing as how he likes resists. Metallic Grimling Bone:  Wt
0.60. 5 AC 3 Str 3 Agi 3 Dex 3 Cha 5 vsCold 25 HP. There's not many ranged
slot options that are droppable and have reasonable HPs, though - Bone,
Goranga, Idol of the Thorned is about it.

    Tormax bracer is a lot more expensive on Quellious. If money becomes an
issue, might want to replace the Tormax with the STA bracer.

    He could also get a Ribbon Choker - those are pretty cheap. It's a HPs
versus resists thing between the two.

    There's usually one for sale every other week on Quellious - for 350 K.
If he has a lot of cash and wants to follow your advice about moving haste,
might try for a Cowl of Mortality here. After those come a lot of middling
helms in the 25-35 HP range that will be dirt cheap.

> Weapons are fine.

    If he can't find a staff of flowing water, might still want to get
another 2HB. There's plenty in the 1:1 ratio range that have come down a lot
in price, like Tranquil Staff, Amygdalan War Staff, Tae Ew Two Handed
Hammer, or Imbued Fighter's Staff. They'll all lay a terrific beating down.

> Take a look at the leather legs made from CT components too.

    Saw those for 35 K last night, and nearly bought them to upsell them.
They're great leggings, but they are heavy if weight becomes an issue (and
it might with a Fungi, and the Barbed Dragonscale Shoes).

    As someone else said, Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves for sure. One minor
quibble I have is with the earrings. A pair of Bloodmetal Earrings of
Engagement will last you a lot longer than the ones you have listed, and
will still be close to top stats at level 53. They'd be 6 AC 61 HP 10 STR 7
STA 5 AGI 13 MR at that level, arguably better than the ones you have
picked. Was price the issue, or were you looking for PR/DR?
