She actually.

And while she may not have been specific about that originally, the point 
is, it fails 34% of the time when it is trivial, whether just trivial, or 
trivial a few points ago does not significantly change the complaint, at 
least not in my mind.

If you carefully read her original post, you will see that she did 
actually mention that she just reached the point where it is trivial 
obliquely.

Her complaint is specifically, that it should not fail 34% of the time if 
it is not possible to learn anything more from making them, and, 
personally, I happen to agree.
