No more than I'd include healing a caster that dropped a nuke to early.
It's a fighter's and wizard's job to cause damage.  It's a priest's job to
heal it.  Or, if you insist on counting the cleric's time into the equation,
then we should do so under constant conditions.  Just a cleric and a warrior
vs just a wizard and a cleric.  Somehow, I think the warrior's going to last
a bit longer.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
