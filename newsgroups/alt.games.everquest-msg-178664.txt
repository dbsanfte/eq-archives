You know, I've heard you mention this before, but it never joshed with
my experience with monks, twinked or untwinked. I saw plenty of monks
that were capable of soloing and tanking in XP groups. I don't doubt
your monk experience, but my monk experience was that, for all but the
hardest XP camps, a monk was the second-choice tank, knight classes
being a distant third. And, when it came to getting multiple AAs in a
single day, nobody beat the monks. Pre-PoP, our guild's top 3 AA
holders were all monks and all had 3x as many or more than the fourth.

I don't *know* which experience was more typical. My impression,
though, was that it was definitely more typical to be overpowerd.

SoS is definitely the most interesting PoP AA. But, I have yet to see
a rogue use it to get a single point of experience. It makes us better
scouts, lets us get into PoM, lets us drag corpses in Velious. The
closest it's come to generating XP was that it meant the PoV cave
group didn't have to come out and get me, but that I could instead
sneak all the way in.
