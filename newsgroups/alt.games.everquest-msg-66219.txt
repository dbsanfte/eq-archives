    You forgot how they look when spellcasting. The "raise your hands and
twitch a lot" is a little funny, but at least the damn thing MOVES when it
does that. Is it just because my system isn't so hot (256 meg RAM, 16 meg
video card), or are half the animations missing? I have something like 15
new character models enabled, and none of them can dance.
