My dubious to both frost and storm giants bard triggered death squad once.  Mobs
popped up and just stood there.  On the other hand, I've run in and out of the
ramp a hundred times, and thats the only time I triggered the squad.  I've heard
detect traps will point to the trigger, I suppose that would work.

My cleric did levels 2 thru 6 on them, they are fun... although by the end of
that exercise the exp slowed to such a crawl that only a desire to be able to
say I'd done it kept me at them.

There are three (or more) factions of giants; Frost, Storm, and King, plus some
giants seem to be KOS to all.  Target and con, I think you are only non-KOS to
frost and storm as a rallos zek worshipper who hasn't actively worked on
faction.
