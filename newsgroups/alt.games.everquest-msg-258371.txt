Depends on what you call "lousy gear" dosent it? The tactical
choice of gear for any class can be as much an important part of
being a "good" player as anything else.

Personally my cleric is rigged for large mana pool and mana
regen, not HP and AC. He can only take a few hits, but can get
through a fast-pulled (30-40 mins) LDoN without a mana break. But
then he was originally created as a guild cleric, and was never
intended to be a tank. There are Warriors, SK's and BL's for
that.
