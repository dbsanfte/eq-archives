Yup. Been eaten by that iksar necro NPC (Vekis) once. I saw him from afar
and just assumed (because he has no title or surname) that he was a PC,
and so took no precautions to avoid him. I was so shocked when his pet
jumped me, I was convinced it was something else killing me until after I
died and checked the logs. Not that it took more than 2 seconds for him
and his pet to obliterate me in any event :)
