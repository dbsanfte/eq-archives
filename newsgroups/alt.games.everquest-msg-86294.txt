As I recall, you can't buy them in Kaladim itself.  You need to go out to the little huts near the entrance to Kaladim.
One of them sells skewer molds.  The downside is that you have to zone twice to buy them, and zone twice again
to use them at the forge.  You  might be better off working on skewers in Kelethin.  The supplies and the forge are
in the same zone.
