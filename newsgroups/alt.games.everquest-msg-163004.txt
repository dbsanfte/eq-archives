I have read where the Necro/Druid Combo works pretty well.  Root, Fear and
then have pet beat the hell out of the mob is pretty impressive.  All the
while the necro can be sucking mobs health for mana.  Also with this combo
you would be able to visit the good cities with the druid while keeping the
necro parked outside and then visit the evil cities with the necro while
keeping the druid parked.
