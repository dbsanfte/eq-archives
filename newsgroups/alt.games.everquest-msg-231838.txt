I must agree with this. On Venril Sathir, a very low population server, there
is one bazaar mule (Keisl) who buys up lots of high end stuff and resells at
higher prices. There is constantly bitching about him in OOC in bazaar and on
the server boards. While there is a quite convincing argument that he is
selling plat to Yantis or whatever (having a multimillion inventory at all
times and making more money than you reasonably need within the game), which 
is despicable on its own, I can't see how it's wrong to make a buck on the
market. As long as people are willing to buy his stuff at his price, that's 
obviously a fair market price, and if not, where's the problem?

The issue is also compounded by the fact that our server has always had prices
that are higher on better gear than other servers. Many of the people who 
movelogged here seem to feel cheated by the fact that the mudflation is more
limited than on other servers and that they cannot get gear in bazaar as
cheaply as on their old servers.

Myself, I'm in favour of more nodrop gear and I think it's good that very good
stuff isn't too easily obtainable in bazaar, so this obviously affects my 
opinion. OTOH hand I have looted stuff Martin w. friends/bot army has killed
they were going to let rot and I could be considered not to deserve, so I
may be considered a bit of a hypocrite in the matter.
