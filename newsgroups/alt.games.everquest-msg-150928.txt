Note, however, that you can't technically "twist" the mana song.

Unlike "buff/icon songs", which can be twisted with other songs and
still maintain 100% efficiency because of overlap, when you're
not singing the mana song, you're not pumping mana.

It has no "residual" time.  When you stop singing the mana song
to bring up another song, the mana song *STOPS*, instantly.  It
doesn't keep hanging on for 18 seconds like most other songs,
it doesn't continue to provide benefits.

So if you're rotating the mana song with two other songs, you're
only giving the casters 1/3 of the mana you could have been
giving had you been playing the mana song full-time.

Maybe this is what the Shaman was griping about.

The upside is that multiple bards playing the mana song multiply
their effect.  Two bards mana-songing will pump 200% as much
mana.  Three bards will produce 300%.  And so on.  This
is because the mana song gives a "packet" of mana each time
it pulses, and unlike "buff songs", won't block another Bard
from feeding his own pulses to the group as well.
