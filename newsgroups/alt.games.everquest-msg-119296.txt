One possibility for this is that your pet is aggroing the greens.  Since he
is lower level than you, they are still blue or light blue to him and will
attack him.  My suggestion is to use "/pet stand up" (not /pet guard here,
since then he would attack any greens that come near him), and set the pet
up near the Paineel zone.  Then find a likely target, cast darkness on it,
and run back to your pet.  When the kobold gets close enough, use "/pet
attack" and proceed as normal.  Also, at your level the skeletons in Tox,
just outside the Paineel zone might still be good exp, it's been a long time
and I can't recall what levels they are.  If they are indeed blue, my
suggestion would be to break the spawn by throwing everything you have at
one of them, then if you get in trouble with the second one just zone.  The
skeletons won't attack unless they are attacked first (which is strange,
since all the other undead I have come across do just that), so you can zone
back out to Tox and med up and summon a pet before engaging the second
skeleton.  You could also probably work the abandonded heretic pet into your
rotation here, he spawns close to the zone but then wanders through the
woods and comes back to check on the skeletons.

Killing kobolds in the Warrens will only give faction to Erudin's guards.
With my Erudite necro, I spent many levels in the Warrens and I am amiable
to Erudin guards, but still very KOS to the casters inside the city.
Paineel, on the other hand, has every NPC in the city on the same faction,
with 2 exceptions:  Duriek Bloodpool in the newbie area, and another NPC
just inside the city.  I have no idea what faction these 2 are on, or if
they are even on the same one, but both were always dubious to my necro.
Every other NPC in Paineel is an ally.

As for the mysterious faction hits, as far as I know you get a faction hit
for anything that is killed, if you happen to be on its hate list.  You
don't necessarily have to do any damage.
