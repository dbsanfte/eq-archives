Being a lvl 54 half elf ranger myself, I'd say go half elf and max your
strength.  The higher your strength is the more damage you put out
consistantly from what I can see.  Get as much AC as you can, while trying
for a high Str and Dex.  However at high lvls Dex can get you killed.
Especially if, say if your epics proc on a high lvl monster you might be
toast, its not pretty.
