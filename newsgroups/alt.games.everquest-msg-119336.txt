I'm certain this wasn't the issue.  She's been using FD on a wide
variety of mobs for quite a while now ( a monk who plays mostly
solo doesn't tend to level up all that fast, got the skill at 17 or 19 and

is now 27) and is familiar with how to FD under fire.  Also, we tried
it about a dozen times, five or six on the first mob and then a couple
times
each on several more of the same type mob.  Also tried it successfully
on several other mobs in the area to see if FD was broken in general...
ONLY "a cyclops" mobs ignored it, they ignored it EVERY time we
tried it.

It was the spookiest thing I ever saw (keeping in mind that I am a mere
27 bard.... as a 59 cleric I've seen a lot scarier stuff)
