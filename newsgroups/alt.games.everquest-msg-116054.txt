Is this the American dream?

1. Small company has a cool product.

2. Microsoft says to small company, "We want to bundle that product in
Windows".

3. Small company says, "Cool!  How much will you pay us?".

4. Microsoft says "Nothing.  It's a privilege to be bundled in Windows.
Everyone will see your name when they look at the 'about' box and then maybe
go buy your other products".

5. Small company says "But without any money from this first product, we
can't develop other products!"

6. Microsoft says, "Tough...and if you don't give it to us free, we'll just
clone it ourselves, and so no one will buy your product anyway.  You might
as well give it to us and get the advertising value at least".

Microsoft does some pretty cool stuff...there's some amazing stuff going on
at Microsoft Research, for example, and they do have some nice products, but
they also *do* do some things that are very shady.  To say that all of the
Microsoft bashing is driven by jealousy is ludicrous.
