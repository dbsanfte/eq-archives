It's the game you and the people you play with make it.

It's top-heavy, but there are people still starting fresh.

There's every level of play from the true casual, to the casual raider 
(we raid once a week and /random 1000 for loot, no favourites, doesn't 
matter how long you've been in the game, it's the least fair system but 
it's the same level of fairness for all), to the non-raiding-hard-core 
player, to the hard-core raider.

To get the most from it, you need to find a bunch of regular people who 
have the same mindset you do, and play in the same timezone, even if you 
don't guild with them, it's tough to enjoy the game without a regular 
set of people, even if you all solo but hang out in the same channels.

Bear in mind - another expansion coming towards the end of the year, 
level cap going to 75 at least, and comments that the expansion will 
contain enough content to go from 1 to 75 without leaving the new 
content (we'll see how that plays out).
