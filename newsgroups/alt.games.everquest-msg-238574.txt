Easiest way without spending any money & uses only a modicum of
pen/paper work is to create a magelo profile.  You only need to know
what your base stats were, the gear you have & the AA's you've bought
then create your own profile for free.  It will calculate all your
stats from that.  What it doesnt do is make allowance for buffs you
may always have & the calculation of your charm / aug stats can be a
bit interesting.  Its a great tool for eveluating equipment changes
too before you lash out any pp in the bazzar.  It does have the
capability to automatically update your inventory but thats going to
cost you 12usd a year.  Even then it still doesnt do your charm /
adventurers stone stats for you but a bit of fiddling around & you can
get to that.
