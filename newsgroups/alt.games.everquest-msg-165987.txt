For 46-50 a couple of good spots are Tenebrous mountains and Echo Caverns.
Tenebrous is nice because you can pick up the Runner Pouch while you are
there.  Also, the Essence of Wind and Windstones that drop there sell well
in the bazaar.  The Underbulks in Echo are great for soloing and Taskmater
room with a partner or small group.  This place is great because it's so
easy to get to.  Nice when you only have a little time to play.
