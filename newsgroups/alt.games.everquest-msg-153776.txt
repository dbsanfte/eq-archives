The beauty of plate armor, IRL, is that it not only distributes
the force of the impact over a broader area, as padding and
chain do, but it deflects the blow so that you do not take the
full force of it.  Much of the plate worn in late medieval (sp?)
times was not extraordinarily heavy (some of the mounted armor
was, but not even all of that) because that would be counter-
productive, a tired and clumsy fighter is soon a dead fighter.
So, although the weight slows you some, and you do suffer from
seriously restricted sight and some loss of hearing with many
plate helms, you are not heavily encumbered and the armor does
<not> get crushed in on your body.  If you want versimilitude,
the plate wearer will get hit sooner (can't run as fast) but will
get a lot further (much better damage mitigation) while the light-
or un-armored person will either get clean away or be obliterated
in a swing or two.  You can't dodge what you can't see, and the
ability to dodge is the biggest advantage a lightly armored or
unarmored combatant has over a heavily armored target.  The
heavily armored combatant does have much better defense from the
front, because he can use his weapon and/or shield to help deflect
incoming blows and make sure they're already striking at an angle
when they contact his armor.

OTOH, for better gameplay, and superior cinematic effect, it might
work well to, as Bergh suggested, give the Monk some sort of a
"runaway" discipline.  Perhaps something that when activated gives
the Monk 360 degree defenses and negates the much greater chance of
being stunned when hit from behind (i.e.  while it's on the Monk
has no "behind").  I don't know if that would matter enough, but it
might, especially if it was a brief effect (12 seconds?) on a short
timer (10 minutes?).
