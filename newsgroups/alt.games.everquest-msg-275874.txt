Doh, they're going to erase my Kane babies :( 
I was fiddling around on that server in my freebie month last year
(which ended after 2 weeks due to the dx9 patch) and only one of them
got to level 10.  The last EQ character I spent time on was a gnome SK
that ran around killing event skeletons with harm touch and dying a
lot. She got lots of random event skeleton loot, was a blast to play
and was a character I wanted to play should I ever come back, but
never got past level 6 with her (due to patch) and now she'll be gone.
Bummer.
(No, not enough to resubscribe and get dx9. Not even an EMarr merger
(which would eat my bazaar mule) would be too likely to do that. 
I think it'd just make 'never return' more permanent instead)
