Druids are powerful, in their way.  It's what makes them good soloers.
For raids, no they're not who you want healing, but in a good exp
grind group, they are more than adequate.  Same thing can be said for
druids nuking ability.  If you want a nuker, you get a wizard.  If you
don't have a wizard, a druid will do in a pinch.  

Hell, in a good exp grind group, I'd take a druid and a shaman over a
single cleric any day.  Shaman buffs, slows, and heals as necessary
and the druid nukes, buffs, and heals as necessary.  All is good.

If you're going for the optimal group, no, don't need the druid, but
most of the time an 'optimal' group just ain't gonna happen.
