Yea...  I'm Ayonaean.  I think I have a friend in your guild, Narraluth, 
although she mighta been in Sect of Norrath or some other one that started 
with S...

}1) So you're in a guild with problems, problems you won't disclose to 
}anyone outside the guild.
}2) You want people in other guilds, on your specfic server, however to 
}to disclose their problems. (Seems a touch hypocritical right out of the 
}gate)
}3) You want to do this discourse *in game*

*shrug*  We all have our foibles.  I would suggest, however, that such 
problems are probably fairly safe to discuss in this group, if you just 
leave out specific names of people and stuff.  And maybe the specific name 
of the guild, but oops, too late. :)

My guild's main problem is that 3/4 of the members want it to be a raiding 
guild, and 3/4 want it to be a family style guild.  Of course, the upshot 
of that is that we're the most family-style elemental guild I know of. :)

}Did it ever occur to you that a simple ooc in the pok (ie *in game*) or 
}other gathering site *on your server* would have a much higher chance of 
}reaching people on your server, who are logged on at the same time you 
}are, and are available to talk at the same time you are???

Or possibly a post on the AyRo boards...  www.ayonae.ro, I think.
