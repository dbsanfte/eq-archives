BAD mistake, and very common.  If you are using an outer layer with
shiny side IN, and an inner layer with shiny side OUT, then it acts as
a trap for the waves.  They accumulate, bouncing back and forth
between the two layers, and then set up a continuous low-level field
that now affects you even when the beam is turned off.

You also don't want it the other way around, because then any stray
waves that make it in are trapped by the inner shiny layer, and bounce
back and forth inside your head.

The tinfoil should alway be applied shiny side OUT, and if you're
going to use multiple layers, put a thin coating of beeswax between
the layers.
