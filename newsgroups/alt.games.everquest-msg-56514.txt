Lol - I remember that first night.  "WTF?!?  My computer seems to lock
up or pause every now and then.  Oh well, the game's still pretty
cool"  It was the next day when somebody explained 'zoning' to me.
:-)

And to piggy-back Dan:  not only should you print some maps, but I
even picked up a small binder.  I print 'em as I need 'em and then 3
hole punch them and add them to the binder (I'd suggest
alphabetically).  After a year of playing (yeah, OK so I'm not a
leveling machine) I've got a pretty thick binder going - but never
have to print a map more than once.  Plus it gives me a nice place to
jot notes and such.
