Monks are viewed as the ultimate melee damage dealer. Why is that? I
mean, it seems that other melee classes have weapons available that
far exceed monks' dmg/dly ratio (don't they?). Yes, monks get dual
wield immediately, but other classes can catch them in skill level at
some point. Special attacks (round kick, tiger claw, etc.) help, but
do they help that much?

I'm having a blast playing my 12 monk, but I was just wondering
why/when I will start putting the other melee classes to shame
damagewise.
