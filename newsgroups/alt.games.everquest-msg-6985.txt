Depends on your level and guild, really. Most of the people I know are going
for Dwarf/Dragon faction (by killing Giants) because the Kael armor quests
require drops from Temple of Veeshan ..

Dragon faction is nice .. It means safe ports to Wakening Lands, as well as
running through Cobalt Scar without needing invis. =)
