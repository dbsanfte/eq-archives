This is not surprising.  The Bazaar is basically the opposite of an auction.

Let's consider auctions for a moment.  In auctions, things tend to be sold
for *more* than they are worth.  For example, a study I recall reading about
of the results of auctions for oil drilling rights on government land found
that the winners usually made little, or even lost money.  Why?  Because the
winner is the company that made the biggest mistake on the side of
overestimating the value of the oil field.

Another example: if you sell by auction $10 worth of pennies, it will
actually go for more than $10.  Why?  Because people hope that some of those
pennies will turn out to be valuable to coin collectors.  The winner is the
person who is the most optimistic.

In the Bazaar, the seller sets a fixed a price, and the buyers pick among
the sellers.  So, the Bazaar is going to go the opposite way--the "winning"
seller is the one that underestimates the value of the item the most.

So, at least for items that are common enough that there will usually be
several sellers, the buyers are at an advantage in the Bazaar.
