>>>I'm on Povar and the Kunark zones are usually empty.<<<

Not true. On Povar you will usually find several peeps in FV banking or what
not. It's less than it was since the boats are nerfed again and people TL
rather than waiting on the boats (in this since, I love the boats being
nerfed), but FV is one of the few areas that melee classes can get bound, so
there's usually someone there binding, banking, or waiting on a rez.

What's your toon name? I'll try and remember to send you a tell in game
tonight and see if I can get by to drag your corpse over to a save place.
