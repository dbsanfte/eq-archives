A friend of mine had a great solution for this...
The same thing happened a while ago in North Freeport. Two players where
killing the bankers as well and annoying everyone else with it. At one time
it went a little wrong and they wanted to leave the bank because the bank
guards where on the upper hand. But they couldn't... Because my friend's fat
Barbarian Shaman ass was (on prupose) blocking the entrance!!
