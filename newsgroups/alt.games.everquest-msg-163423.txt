I have a rather sucky computer so I have a lot of lag problems in PoK 
and other places but in the exp planes like PoD and PoN it's not that 
horrible actually. Granted I have clip rather low down there too but 
since I rarely pull I get away with that. Around the graveyards just 
/hidecorpses or you'll lag a lot there. Zone in to one of the other 
planes and walk around a little along the walls to see if it works for 
you. Try PoD or PoN for example.. PoJ is a bit laggy at zonein but when 
you get further into the place it's not very bad.
