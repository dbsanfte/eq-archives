The (white number) is what that particular stat will be after you
reach the recommended level listed on the item. The red number is what
it is for you currently. For example, if you at level 15 had a weapon
listed DMG 5(10) DLY 20 and a recomended level of 35, then at level
15, you're wielding a 5/20 weapon. The dmg stat will slowly increase
each level until you hit 35, at which point it will be a 10/20 weapon.
Be greatful they didn't take the suggestion not to allow certain
powerful items to be used at all below a "recommended level"... ><
(Bank in some old MUDs, certain items would snarl and leap from the
hands of a person who tried to use them at too low level...)

Recommended level is basicly a way to introduce powerful, non-nodrop
items into the game that won't unbalance the lower-end game through
twinking...
