As long as you stay in the outer area near the entrance, a mid-to-high
20s group has no problems, IME. Admittedly most of us were fairly
twinked, but then most low level characters seem to be on the older
servers. You really want someone with greater healing, i.e. 24+ cleric
or 29+ druid/shaman, and a reasonably full group, but the difficulty
really scales with how far in you go, so you can adapt to the
circumstances, and in the worst case move out to take the gnolls
outside.

Important point is to never ever get inside the doors or let fleeing
gnolls get inside, that can get messy if you're mid-20s.
