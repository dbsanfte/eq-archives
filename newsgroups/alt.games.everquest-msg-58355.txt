DDs cost more mana than DoTs for less damage, typically.  You
pay for the "advantage" of being able to damage the mob instantly.
You're right that the ability to med during the fight isn't the key to
efficiency, though.

And if you're willing to give up mana efficiency as well.   AoE spells
change
the equation, though, because the AoE nuke isn't more mana expensive
than DoTs on four mobs.   That's why quad-kiting is the way to go for
classes able to use that tactic.
