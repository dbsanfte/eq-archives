Ive a level 18 Leezard Shadowknight that has been twinked hard by some RL
Friends with an ardent defender ( 33/49 2hs weapon), and gear that brings
his strength to 185 after he does a 10 pt siphon strength. With the AD the
Lizard has hit for as high as 35, and its not all that infrequent for him to
do so.
