Well at 60ish our group could not kill fast enough. dps is the rule there.
What suggestions such as group makeup etc seems best. seems balanced to
maybe 62 getting through them. what buffs seem to be working. For example
area mez was pitiful - the little rock guys do not care for it. single mez
slow but effective. Straight haste seemed slightly better (WR) than VoG. We
could kill but our prisoner was executed.
