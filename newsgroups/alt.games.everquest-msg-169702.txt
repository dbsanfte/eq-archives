Just out of curiosity, what kind of pet was this? I'm guessing level 62 
mage water pet?

Btw, I parsed some fights with the level 60 cleric summoned hammer 
against undead (hammer has 10 dmg bonus to undead) that were dark blue 
at 60 (sun reavers/revenants on the plateau in scarlet desert) with 
shaman buffs (dex maxed) schw haste (21%?), shaman 50% haste while not 
tanking (no stuns, no timeouts to heal) and I would average somewhere 
around 30dps. Solo (only self buffed, plus tanking so I had to heal 
myself) against FG shrooms with hammer pet (about 10 or so dps) and MoR 
15pt damage shield I would get more like 20-25dps.
