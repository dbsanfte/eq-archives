>TEST

Ok.. I am gonna 'reply' to my original post and not just pick a post
of the many and not to mention unexpected replies to my little 'test'

1). This was not intended as ANY kind of troll message, nor was I was
on a fishiing expedition!!

2.) I have problem with pretty screwed up character spacing in
messages in the NG's and I had just made my new sig (as appropiate to
this NG), so I figured I would kill two birds with one stone and just
check it with my sig.. it still ain't right but after 5 tries.. I
figured that was ENOUGH!!

3.) The only mistake I made here was choosing this NG to do the test.
I should have used a dead group.
Hey it was late and I was tired... so did it in the one group I tend
to hang out the most.... Never thought anyone would be 'petty' enough
to actually reply to a frigging test.. but then as long as I have been
on usegroups.. should have known better!!
Again I will say it.. was very tired!!

4.) Most (but not all) appear to act like little whiney childred with
TOO much time on their hands and feel the need to use that time to
trash/flame some poster cause he made some kind  of mistake..
regardless of your rationale <sp> for the flame

I see folks type some really 'dumb' stuff in NG's all the time and I
NEVER felt the need to flame them..
Aye... poke a little fun at them maybe and suggest another way of
saying it.. maybe

ie... misspellings. kinda of like typing rouge instead rogue ;-)

...... asking a really dumb question! (dumb by whose defination?), but

       then there are really no dumb questions.. only the unasked   
       questions!!

ect......

5.) This to dipstick that talked about wasting space.. bandwidth,
whatever.... why don't you take up the crusade to stamp out cross
posting bulk spammers.. whose posts have not relavence to the group
whatsoever...
At least my little test had some relavence to the NG, albeit marginal
at best.. but still.......


6.) this one will go out to all those that haven't put me in their
killfiles... you can let the ones that did pledge to put in killfile (
or not, I could careless actually). know that:

That is absolutely frigging FANTASTIC...
Because those are just the kind of anal retentive ASSHOLES.. that I
would prefer that didn't read any of my posts and replie to them!!!
