You can move forward to the ledge, but no further, after that its one way.

That still leaves about ten spawns worth of fighting, I've seen three
"entry"
groups staying happy without going over the ledge.

Alternate plans: bring a porter so you can get out easily.  Bring a 55+ mage

and make sure he binds outside, so he can gate out and then COTH you
all back up.  Don't bring anyone that can't gate.  Umm, I think there might
be
an exit you can walk to, but I've never seen it myself.  Then again, I can
gate
and rarely go anywhere without a porter.
