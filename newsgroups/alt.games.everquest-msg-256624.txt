Hey this is one of my posts from July 1999. :-) Oddly enough, some of
it still rings true today!

Notice the reference to players playing "on the eastern half of the
map". Today, I wager 19 out of 20 players do not know which direction
Qeynos is from Freeport. There is no more regionalism, hasn't been in
a long time now.

Or about getting killed by the famous killer NPCs... newbies have it
so easy now they'd shrug them off.

I quoth....
