Among the "spells" you'll see listed in a complete spdat parse are
effects like "Lay Hands" and "Harm Touch".  Also some "spells" are
present in the game only as item effects, but since they use the
spell game mechanics they're added to the spdat under the listing
of one class or another.  And, of course, there are AA abilities
like the ones you've been looking at.
