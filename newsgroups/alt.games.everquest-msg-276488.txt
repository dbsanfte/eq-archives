I was almost *sure* they would nerf the Doll, because it really is an
excellent item.  I couldn't begin to guess how much an equivalent drop
would cost, if you bought it in the Bazaar.  It also really shows up,
in comparison, how crummy an in-game item they gave away for buying
OOW.  *Everyone* playing EQ will have this Doll on all their alts -
and will have made alts in their spare slots just to have the Doll for
future use - and yet all you got for buying an expansion was a
sparkly-effect item, lol.  That said, the key-ring thingie was pretty
good, so it's swings and roundabouts :)

It sure is a very shabby trick *selling* the thing to unsuspecting
dupes.
