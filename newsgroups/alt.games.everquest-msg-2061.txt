Hi

I would just like to say a big thankyou to all who posted replies.
Your advice was invaluable, I spent the last 11 hours battling away and so
far, got some armour that shows up on the character (hooray!).  Got the Tax
collectors box, thanks for that tip! Also learned all sorts from the
websites. Used a strategy guide from alak-wotzits web page and made it to
level 9! great!, got magic to play with now  : )
So thanks again for setting me on the right path by answering my questions,
this is the most enjoyable game I have played for years......and it just got
better!

Cheers

Jackal
