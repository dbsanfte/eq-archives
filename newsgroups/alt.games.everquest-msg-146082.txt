    And we just got a big incentive to move away from anywhere you'd care
about. Last night in Vex Thal not only was more loot dropping off bosses,
and loot dropping off the yard trash (albeit very rare), but Ancient spells
dropped off the bosses. As soon as we saw the first one, that was it - we
decided we'd never go back to NToV again. We haven't been in a few months as
is, but there was always pressure to go back and at least farm the Ring of
Vulak for Ancient spells. No more!
