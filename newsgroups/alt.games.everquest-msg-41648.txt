    And I don't even believe that ordering. Zebuxoruk is usually amongst the
least populated, but it's been at the opposite end from the PvP servers
recently. And look at the spacing in the PvP servers - have some of the
regular servers gotten THAT empty over the past few days? I've switched back
to sort by server name, since I don't think sort by pop is working now.
