My apologies, my English sense of humour didn't translate too well I see.

As for the character name Kaev, my very first char was called Ajnin and he
was a Wizard of all things he was created well before I learned the word
'Ninja' had somehow became twisted in EQ to mean someone that shows no
respect for the looting rights of others!,  I've had the R/L nickname of
Ninja for the past 17yrs why should I not use a name that I answer to in
R/L? Surely it's better than Healsu, or Rezzdya?

btw I've *never* had problems finding groups - it doesn't matter what you
call yourself players will soon get the word around if they see a 'bad egg'

oh and my IQ is above room temp - maybe not by much but above all the same
;-)

Ninjha 57 Rogue <Veturi>
Stting 61 Dru <Veturi> (Semi-retired)
