I can live with that. How about this - every case *I* have heard of,
when any whodunit was given, has been done without any high-tech
means.

And in the interest of fairness, my knowledge of cases of EQ account
thefts come only from commonly available Internet areas, such as this
newsgroup and the larger web sites.

And also in the interest of fairness, I've yet to see LG exhibit a
single documented case where the kind of high-tech theft she's so fond
of has occurred.
