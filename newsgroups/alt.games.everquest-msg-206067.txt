That's because the nasty roaming inkies (and some of the static ones
as well) all roamed into other zones.  The weaker ones went to places
like West Commonlands, Crushbone, and North Ro, while the tough ones
went to places like the Overthere and Kithicor.  Given the choice
between coddling their young-uns and terrorizing the other races on
Norrath, I'd say it's a no brainer for any true follower of Innoruuk.
As for you whiney inky babies, that's just TFB.  So you don't get to
have your cake and piss on it too, boohoo.  :-p
