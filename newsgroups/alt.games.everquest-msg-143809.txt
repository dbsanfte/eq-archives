I had a similiar experience in Warsliks woods, brute caves. I made two
levels there with my mage and was already happy about the money loot. I
also, ofcourse, picked up all gems, word, runes and so on that dropped. i
thought i could get  few pp on top of my money loot.
Man i was happy when after emptying my sacks'o'crap in OT outpost. I had
flat 200pp in hand. Really nice. No more wondering how i am going to pay for
my next spells.
