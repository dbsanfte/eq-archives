That would only be true IF the encounter doesn't reset
when it calculates XP.   Say you're a low-level druid
with a damage shield -- you group with a high-level
who damages a mob down to a sliver of health and
then disbands (either intentionally or through LD.)
The mob then turns on you -- and it's orange/red
group, let's say -- and kills itself on your damage
shield.   Do you get the XP?   If you do, it's a way
to PL.   That's why I assume the encounter would
be broken...
