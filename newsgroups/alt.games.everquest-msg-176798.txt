i don't know about tailoring, but i've definitely heard that you
can make money on smithing, once you get your skill up quite a bit
more.

there are lots of nice armor pieces that require grandmaster-level
skill (around 240-150).  people are willing to pay several tens of
thousands of plat for you to make these.

i'd say the biggest variable is your server.  are there any other
GM smiths to drive the prices down?

i recommend you read Richard Lawson's post entitled "Monual's
Smithing Quest".  do a google search for it.  it's damn entertaining
in its own right, and it gives a good feel for how difficult it is
to raise your skill that high, and for what kind of profits you can
earn once you get there.
