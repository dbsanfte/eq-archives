I'm not sure about THIS spell but:

You get ALL spells that are part of your class when
you 'ding' the appropriate level.  That *may* be
partially into a level.   Druids, for instance, get SoW
at 13.8 -- 80% of the way through level 13.

Note:  you may also receive certain other spells,
such as ones targeted on a specific type of mob,
by doing quests, etc.  You won't receive those
if you don't do the quest and so on.

It's also useful to know some (all?) of the spell
lists out there are NOT entirely accurate yet,
even on the low-level spells.
