A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

Okay I've been saying EQ is a lot easier and dumbed down than it used
to be but apparently I hadn't realize just how FAR it has fallen.

7 weeks for someone who has never played before to go to L48?

Oh the times have changed, the times have changed indeed.

To answer the history of your question, at least, in times past a
cleric would be able to afford reagents (and new armor as well) simply
by saving up the money they collected over the long haul of exping up
that far.

Obviously you haven't had that process. It sounds like you were in the
fast track zone at every stage of the game. That's okay for people who
are twinking but its going to leave you hurting in a big way, as by
now you must be noticing your mana pool just isn't holding up to the
demands being put on it (how many cheals can you cast in newbie
armor?).

And so, though I think extremely poorly of giant farming in general,
something generally done by people who don't know theres much better
ways of farming cash... in your case @ndrew is right, its about the
best you're likely to come up with until you're more properly
equipped.

The next zone on your fasttrack would be PoJ exit, which is
exceedingly bad loot, so I suggest you start finding parties in places
that actually drop loot and stop going for maximum exp gain for a
little while, or you will trash your reputation as people come to know
you as the guy who is constantly out of mana.

You could always ask them if they are okay with you doing that at the
start.
