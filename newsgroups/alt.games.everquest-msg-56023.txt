You're exploring a new dungeon - the above is half the fun, and breadcumbs
are sure-as-shit not going to help either.

I don't know about anyone else, but I won't group in a zone I don't know
my way around in. There is no way in hell I'm going to put myself into a
position of being a liability to my groupmates because I get lost at the
drop of a hat.

And once you're spun, do the coins now lead deeper into the dungeon, or do
they lead out?

/doability 1
/loc

A single hotkey, and a LOT more reliable.

Summoned stuff would work just as well. I don't see the breadcrumb trail
of coins being of sufficient use to warrant Verant not nerfing coin drops.
