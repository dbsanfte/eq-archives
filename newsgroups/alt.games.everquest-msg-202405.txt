The curious thing is the +2 wis.
None of the other quest gems have stats.

I guess you could check the vendor price.
The quest gems sell for either ~24pp or ~47pp IIRC
If it is close to one of those numbers (with max sale price) then I guess 
that it could be one of those.

The other thing is that Jasper make +Wis Jewelery, so there is some link 
with wisdom there.

Still very odd.
