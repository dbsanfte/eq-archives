What WAS the lowest is no longer possible. Epics have been nerfed such that
the final turn ins can't be done until either 50 or 51 now (don't recall
which). They'll eat your stuff if you try and do it too soon.  Some of the
interim turn ins seem to have level floors on them too.

Thing that erks me about this is that they quests still don't say anything
about level limits, so the notion of eating your turn ins seems a bit harsh.
