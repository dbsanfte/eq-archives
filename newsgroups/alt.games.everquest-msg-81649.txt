I keep sense heading on one of my buttons at all times (all pages
of buttons) and map the left and right steering keys to that
button.  That way, every time I hit the key to turn either left
or right I exercise sense heading.  Some people use the forward
key, but I use the steering key because auto-run only hits it
once if you're using the forward key, but the steering keys are
always available and I use them all the time.
