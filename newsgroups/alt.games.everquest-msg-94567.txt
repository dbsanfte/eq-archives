Except the fact that the internet ad market completely blew up is the
entire reason why allakhazams is now offering added utility for paid
subscriptions.

Ads and popups will no longer pay for a site, even if it gets 150,000
visits a day like his does. Why don't they pay for it? Well, some very
smart (sarcasm) marketing people finally got wise to the fact that you
can have a banner ad or popup on Allakhazams but no one is going to
that site and buying your product. Zero sales = zero reason to
continue to pay money to this site to display your ad.

Unix/Linux popular sites found out the same thing, most of them are
such a service to the unix community though that they managed to get
hosted for free by a company. Of course, they are also not for profit
and the person running them usually has a real job.

Ads and popups are fine, if the five dollars you'll get from them a
month is enough to run your website. Its only even going to be five
dollars if you get a huge ton of hits.

I think the site I used regularly with the most frank commentary on
this (the internet ad market bomb) was lumthemad.net before that went
belly up. It was still running ok before Lum left though, like some
sites such as penny arcade it managed to get by well enough with pay
pal contributions.

www.magelo.com seems to really have the best idea for an eq pay for
site. It is trying to offer something that no other sites offer, that
is the tying in of all of your guild members magelo and equipment
(availible as something seperate for anyone for free) along with a
nice advanced guild site messageboard/database system. I think the
entire guild thing is still in beta. The regular magelos are already
set up to be coupled in, with an ability to designate particular items
as being owned by a guild and such on your character's magelo. The
guild site would be a pay for thing, though the fee is more than
reasonable ( I think it was 39 bucks for a year.. if i remember right)
while having a magelo for your character itself is free (many people
only do that and have them as sigs in their ezboard messages.

The reason I use that as an example of the best EQ pay site, is that
it has a real value (the guild site you paid for) and tie in to
something very nice which any of your members can use for free (the
magelo character display) while having none of it being dependant upon
player submitted content. I think once actual guild sites are using
that we will be pretty impressed.
