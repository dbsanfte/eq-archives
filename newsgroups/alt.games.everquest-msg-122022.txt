Why do you report the name to the GM if it isnt the name that pisses you

Of course they should have a right to whatever name they want. They paid for
the game, they pay every month for their subscription, just the same as you

Play on Firiona Vie if you want to roleplay, if enough players switch,
Verant will create more roleplay servers.
