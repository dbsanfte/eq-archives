Hey anti-fanboy, check out the screams on the DAoCVault as Mythic
found and today removed a Bonus that was added way back in early beta
to make archers viable back when they sucked. They forgot to take it
out. Ooops. It's gone now and Archers are now in the same boat as
every other character class. No more one shots on orange characters.
It was a bug and its been fixed. 

He wasn't spewing out "everything is happy" he was asking Venture to
not comment on a game he hasn't played based on his dislike of Pvp
from UO. Does anyone here think UO got Pvp right? *chirp chirp chirp*
Nope didn't think so.  This isn't UO, this is "no loss on death, no
item stealing no Azzraping emotes" Realm versus realm.
