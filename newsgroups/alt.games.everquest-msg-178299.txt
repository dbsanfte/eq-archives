A sad thing to have to contemplate, but I seriously doubt these folks ever
saw it coming.  Once the shuttle broke apart, exposing them to Mach 18
relative winds, they must have been destroyed so near instantly that they
never had time to feel it.  Consider that many explosives have a slower
blast rate than the speed of the relative wind we're talking about and the
difference between explode and disintegrate fades to zero.  It's a small
consolation in this terrible tragedy, but as I said, I really cannot imagine
them feeling any pain when it happened.

The loved ones left behind, on the other hand, will be nauseous with grief
right now.  Theirs is the least enviable situation of all as far as I can
see.
