Yep, the guaruntee is 3 hours whether offline OR online or ALL the way
off line OR in the chat area OR on the character select screen. If you
CAN'T get a res the best way to possibly get more time is /camp, then
exit, then get all the way out of the game. You then might be able to
get a res when back on even if its more than 3 hours or you might not.
If you hang around in game, or on the char select screen, OR on
another character for 3 hours, it is a guaruntee that you WON'T get an
xp res.
