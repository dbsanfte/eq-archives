As a monk that packs a cleric 2-box, I sympathize.  =)

They worked in 2000 the first time I made use of them, and wiped to VS with
a raid force of 50+ people.  They worked in 2005 the last time I made use of
them, and beat VS with my 2-box cleric, me tanking, a rogue and a druid.  At
least the ones I use (I never got to play with flux/knockback myself, so I
had to be even more creative).  So I know it's still possible. 
Coincidentally, I was playing a magician back then, my monk having just
gotten started, so this isn't anything monk specific.

The tricks in CoM are harder to pull off, and in my experience very machine
dependent.  A fast computer is a necessity, otherwise you "drift" too much
in your flight.  There was one common "trick" in Howling Stones to get to
east wing faster that utterly defeated me for that very reason for a long
time even though I saw other people pull it off.
