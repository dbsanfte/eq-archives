AOL.  My local exchange isn't ready for ASDL as yet and a complete and
utter lack of cable here leave me with a distinct lack of any other
options.  AOL 7.0 has horrible issues with EQ; 6.0 and earlier seem OK
with the odd random drop and packet loss most people on a 56k have
learned to live with.  AOL is somewhat variable depending on what node
you connect to however if you get a decent connection you're USUALLY
set for the duration of your EQ session.

I was using Freeserve for a while but the 2 hour cutoff was a huge
PITA.  I really REALLY wouldn't touch any of the "new" or "relaunched"
ISPs with a barge pole unless you're willing to fork out for some
special business tariff.
