Really?! Sweet, well maybe crappy for the resale business but oh well.
The same process applies, if you find it cheap BUY IT. You will always
eventually find a buyer that will provide you with a profit. I kind of
like the idea of the bazaar [Trader] system, just walk up and if it's
the price you want the item is yours. No human contact needed. :p

PS- There is a quest in CS that allows 4 Ulthork Tusks to be turned it
so if you're high level enough to get the tusks easy then try it out,
you get a blue diamond sometimes and other times a jewelry piece that
will sell for like 90pp-200pp+, once I got some stupid dust that sold
for 2pp but looking at the stats of other people who did the quest
that is very very rare.
