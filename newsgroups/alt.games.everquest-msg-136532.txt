On the /who bug.  I talked to a Verant CS person in their live tech help,
and he asked me what zone I was doing /who in.  It seems that there is an
issue with /who when it is going to return a long list, and it just locks up
EQ.  Since then, numerous fellow guild members have mentioned that they have
the problem, in Hate this weekend, with less than 40 people in zone, it was
always locking up anyone using the new UI.

Also noticed post patch, some off and on issues with the chat channels.
During said Hate raid, all chat channels stopped working for some of us.
Fortunately, we were the only ones in zone, so we just fell back on /auc,
/ooc, and /shout.  It wasn't guild only, so we had to use public channels.

So far, I only use the new UI when I want to shop in the Bazaar, will
continue that until they have the /who bug ironed out.
