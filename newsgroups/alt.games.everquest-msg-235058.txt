Let me state right now that my Dwarf Bezerker is only level 4 but
after looking at the tomes that will be available in future levels and
using some of the skills (namely "Corroded Axe") I think this class
has potential.  In taking a look at the Bezerker message boards
(eqbezerker.com?) I am surprised to read that so many people have not
tried throwing axe's or using the "Corroded Axe" skill.  That was the
first thing I did was get the axe components to I could use that
skill.  I think it's great.  If I get a stack of basic axe components
and use the Corroded Axe skill, that stack will eventually yield for
me 400 axes to throw (1 basic axe component will yield 20 Corroded
Axes).  I was using the axes to pull stuff toward me.  I managed to
get a SoW and I attempted to kite some of the mobs I was fighting.  I
am guessing that as a Bezerker levels that he will have updated combat
abilities which will require better axe components to yield better
axes (or other thrown weapon types) to throw which would (I'm
guessing) do more damage.  At level 4 I was doing 4-6 points of damage
for every successful throw.  Granted, that's not a lot of damage but
it enabled me to wear down a mob to the point where I could melee with
him and eventually slay him without taking much damage.  Yeah, yeahï¿½I
know that skunk in Butcherblock Mountains hardly qualifies as a
dangerous mob.  At level 8 Bezerkers get a new combat ability called
Leg Chop which, if I understand correctly, acts as a snare/slow.

I think over the next several months there will be a lot of changes to
the Bezerker class to balance it out.  I think this class will develop
like the Beastlord did.  A lot of people thought Beastlords were a bad
class but Sony eventually made the right changes to make it a great
class.

My 2 cp.
