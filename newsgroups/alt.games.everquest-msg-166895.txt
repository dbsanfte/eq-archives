Aye, the precise numbers are not something I have access too, I made these up
100%.  Using the real numbers would be much more informative.

I don't think thats accurate, as I understand it the difference between your
level and the level of your prey matters at every level, although when mobs go
cyan that difference is further accellerated, and when green its 100%
eliminated.  On the other hand, I could be wrong, got a source for the real
details?

This to me is the worst feature of PoP, it destroys so much interesting pre-PoP
content as interesting from an exp standpoint.

Here's something I was thinking, though, what if each level 61 thru 65 was
instead two levels; going from 60 to 70.  Because of built in level related
isssues, they didn't want your resists to go that high, or resists on mobs to go
that low, and they wanted to leave the higher level pre-PoP content structured
as is, so they only give you your level benefits every two levels.  But for exp
purposes, they wanted your increased power not to be too overbalancing, so they
changed the greening out numbers to reflect doubled levels.

Does this make sense, at 61 do you see greening out you'd expect for going from
60 to 62? Is 62 what you'd expect at 64?
