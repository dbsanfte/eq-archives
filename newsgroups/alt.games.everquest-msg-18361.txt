Four problems:

1) Size of the log file will make this an intensive task, and would therefor
make it something reserved only for extreme measures.  They want to maximize
CPU time for play time.  However, if logging is automatically shunted to a
master log server this would not be an issue.  I do not know which way it is
configured.

2) This would take an actual GM at Varent, not some Guide.  Their time is
protected at all costs for an assortment of reasons.

3) There is a limit to what Varent logs.  They went into some of this in
their talks about/with the guild that was banned.

4) I think I read something in one of their letters about you having to
protect yourself from this sort of thing.  I don't remember if that was part
of the producers letter about items being recovered, or if it was somewhere
else in a FAQ.

I wish they would enforce this sort of thing, and perhaps thin out the
idiot, liar and cheater population on the servers, but I do not think it
will happen.
