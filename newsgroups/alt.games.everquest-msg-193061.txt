No kidding.  Not only that, but it was effectively impossible for a
non-twink lowbie to get much in the way of weapons or better-than-
patchwork armor.  There were so many sellers in the "auction" zones
that nobody even tried to sell the cheap (under 10pp) stuff, it all
got dumped on vendors who would charge 28pp for items they paid a
player 3gold for.  Nowadays you can get a better kit than my main
had at L20 for under 100pp, and you can _easily_ accumulate 100pp by
L8 or so selling spiderling silk.  Even before the player market for
silk got big you could make 300pp or so off wisps by L15 (well, most
players could, there are some class/race/diety combinations that are
sol with both the goodie and baddie wisp stone buyers).  300pp will
get you a very usable kit in the bazaar, and leave plenty of cash for
your spells thru L20 or L24 at the same time.  The bazaar was/is a
huge boon for lowbies.
