OK, first questions is to all of you who have been in EQ since Kunark and
Velious came out.  What can we expect when Luclin is live.  What happens to
the populations in the old "favorite" zones and the old "perma-camped"
spawns.  Does everyone and their dog...er...kerran, go off to explore the
new zones or do some die-hards still try for the old spots.

to speculate, I wonder what will happen to the zone population in the rest
of Norrath?  With the number of servers and with current number of zones
increasing by about 20-30, that means less players per zone.  I don't
imagine that the player numbers will increase at the same rate to keep the
ratio the same.  I do expect the server population to go up to at least
3000 - 3500? (no way to tell) with the curiosity seekers, and that will
probably fade a bit over time.   On that note, I wonder what the populations
are at now with DaoC drawing players away?

Personally, I am torn between rushing into Luclin and seeing the new sites,
looting the new drops...etc.  - or - trying to get some of the rare items in
the "old" and "not quite as old but still old" worlds.  I don't plan on
starting a cat but I could maybe see starting an ogre, troll, or barb
beastlord as the newbie grounds would be less crowded and more well known.

Lastly,  I've been wondering lately what will be EQ's "exit strategy"?  What
will happen 1-2 years down the road.  Will it keep evolving with more and
more expansions?  Will the server populations dwindle to the point where
Verant starts to consolidate servers into new "merged" servers? i.e.
Vazelle-Xev?   An interesting gambit would be an entirely new realm (EQ2?)
and have a huge "END of the WORLD event" in the current Norrath with
everyone sticking around and participating, being transfered to the new game
with certain rewards and stats, and giving them 1 free month to play.

Just idle speculation,

Hail,
Orlun, dwarven rake, Xev
