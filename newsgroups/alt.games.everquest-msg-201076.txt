Some people have reported that gamma problem with DX9, SOE have announced
that they dont provide support for DX9, and that you should contact
Microsoft about that. I run XP on my Athlon system and DX9 with v43.xx
detonator drivers for my geforce4 card without any problems.
What videocard manufacturer do you use? I used to have an Asus, but they
really have some problems, and wouldnt surprise me if they still have
problems.
