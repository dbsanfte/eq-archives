I can't believe how many people don't know much about them.  I honestly
didn't know much myself until I got into a group with a decent bard while
using my Necro.  The next day I made a bard.  Nothing else is as much fun to
play!

Thank you!   Wish I heard this more often!

Highest taunt.  Yes!  Hell, all I have to do is walk around with heal song
up and I might as well have a sign on my back that says "Kick/slash/bash
me".  I don't even have to try to taunt, just bard about the place.

Plus I love it when people want you to pull and don't understand why they
aren't getting the effects of mana/heal regen, etc.

Don't you love getting tells from guildies saying, "Hello?  Are you
there???"  While you are charm kiting?

The other thing I have to add to this is when you might have been sitting
afk for a bit, get up and go to run and you realize you're not as fast as
you should be because some "kind soul" cast sow on you!  Save your mana!
Don't sow a bard unless they ask!
The same goes for breeze.  I can't tell you how many times I've had breeze
and sow cast on me without even asking.  Kind move on some peoples parts,
but why can't I find these kind souls when I'm using my necro???


Safe travels,
SEAN...
