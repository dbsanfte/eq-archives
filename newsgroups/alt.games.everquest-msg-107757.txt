And, although they made a bad choice in how they went about handling that
incident (they were listening to the group of advisors who had now
experience in the type of situation), I'm glad the Feds went after the
Students of the Seven Seals (or Branch Davidians, if you prefer). The FBI
had received reports that the children at the compund were being sexually
abuse, alhough they have since confirmed that the allegations were false.

Also, the Branch Davidians were a time bomb, Vernon Howell(or David Koresh,
as he later changed it to) was preaching that the end of the world was
coming and durng the final days he and his following would battle with the
US government, he believed this would be the war of Armegeddon. The thing is
that eventually these people would have left the compound and used those
weapons.

Unfortunately, the move on the compound was poorly planned and handled. The
feds had one group saying that a show of force would aggravate the Branch
Davidians into firing weapons, while others said that they were just
bluffing and would eventually cave in. Of course, we know wich group was
right and which was listened to.

I'm aware that my last statement there is jumping to a bit of a conclusion,
we don't know who really fired the first shot, or what the circumstance to
prompt it was.

But to you're question of "did the state allow them there rights": you don't
have the right to own automatic weapons, which the Branch Davidians did. and
I wouldn't call a bunch of people that believe that when they decide that
the end of the world is at hand they should go kill people a "well regulated
militia".
