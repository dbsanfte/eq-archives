 No. I don't find it strange. And the Halls of Honor drop rate is now
virtually nothing if you want to know. Gravy? Hardly. It's called
benefits. Again, having a high Spectral rate only helped the lower end
guilds, since there would be a lot of the 63-64 spells floating around.
Now you're screwed even more that you were. Congratulations!

 According to Verant, yes. And you don't have to be in the top 2 guilds
on the server to get into HoH. Sure, the upper end guilds get in there
faster, but like anything else others will catch up eventually.

 Why can't I? Besides, I don't design the zones and drop rates. It's
like anythiong else in EQ, being there first (usually) has it's
advantages. Anyway, apparently the whiners got what they wanted because
it's no longer that way. I haven't seen a windblade or belt drop in the
past three days and we have a lot of people XPing in there. Spectral
Parchments have also been whacked. You'd be lucky to get 3 in 6 hours.
