Hee hee... then tolkien's effort to confuse was more successful than
he thought. Here, I'll try to break it down:

The confusion comes from the repeated use of the word "half". We can
clear it up a bit by identifying those uses where 'half' refers to the
audience, and removing them by segmenting the audience.

His first clause contains a selector; it only applies to 'half' the
audience, and the second clause contains another; it only applies to
'less than half' the audience.  Lets assume the audience is
pre-segmented so that only those who are being selected by the
selectors are present; this allows us to remove them.  Then he would
have said to the first group ("half of them"):

"I don't know you half as well as I should like, 

Implying he regrets not knowing them better.

And to the second group ("less than half of them"):

and I like you half as well as you deserve."

Implying that he regrets that he didn't like them as much as they
deserved. That he should like them more.

Put together, he expresses regrets that he did not know and appreciate
his neighbours as much as they deserved, or as much he, in hindsight,
would have wanted to.

Clearly a compliment.
