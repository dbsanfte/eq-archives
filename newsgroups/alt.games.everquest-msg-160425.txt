Oh, I can understand not allowing character transfers, and all that.  No
arguments from me there.  I just think it's weak that they're "Mac Only"
servers.  It almost doesn't seem worth it, at this point.  We'll have to
keep a list of the different EQs to chose from.  Which EQ do you play?

EQ
EQ2
EuropeEQ
MacEQ
PS2EQ
