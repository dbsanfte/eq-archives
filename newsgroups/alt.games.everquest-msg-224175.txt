Grummus is about twice as hard as AD.  :)  And this coming from a
melee-heavy-guild perspective, AD seems like he'd be even easier with a ton
of nukers.

They're not hard to kite, but if the clerics let themselves get too low on
health they get frenzy aggro.  Obviously you have to avoid that by having
backup healers able to watch the main clerics (or, the better way, have a
bard with them singing resists so they aren't getting hurt in the first
place).

You can probably assume the adds are controlled unless you're using odd
choice kiters.  Face it, druids and rangers already know how to kite just
fine.  :)  What you're running into is low health frenzy aggro probably,
which means something else needs adjusted, not the kiting.

I'm about 99.9% certain it isn't true.  I'm pretty sure my magician has had
61+ pets feared.  What *is* true is that air pets are immune to Aerin Dar's
AE.  I don't think any of the other pets are (though as my magician is
ranked 3rd on getting equipped, I only have air and water pets so far).
