Since the last BigHonker(tm) patch, I haven't been able to zone into
Nexus (on Mith Marr).  Well, I can zone in, but can't zone out.
Making it a Gnome Motel of sorts.  I've tried on 3 different
computers, with and without firewall.  Always the same.

Zone in, get booted back to character select.  When I try to log in
again, I can get to character select, then character starts to load,
then right back to character select.  I tried deleting and
re-downloading all *nexus* files in the EQ directory.  No dice.

I suspect my provider is failing at DNS lookup on whatever server
nexus is hosted on. 

Anyone else have this problem?

Anyone run a snoop who can tell me hostname:ip_address of
nexus.mithmarr.everquest.com (or whatever, not sure how it works)?
