/agree

Generally CGW is consistent in their reviews (I have subscribed for
about 6 years now). 4.5/5 is usually reservered for games that are
exceptional and complete when they ship. That is what pissed me off
about their DAoC review. It was completely inconsistent, and served
more as a "Better than EQ" piece than a genuine review.
