Depends on the mob, bow and ranger. I saw a ranger LFG trying to bow kite
in PoV, one of the little snarable larvae the druids so love to dot. Took
at least 15 minutes and the ranger almost died twice. The bow graphic in
question wasnt the same as Primal - once you start talking AM3, EQ and
Primal you're talking about a seriously high end ranger who is just beginning
to be able to solo *anything* in POP, as opposed to the fresh off the boat
solo classes who can do it successfully and efficiently right away.

Even you have said Ranger soloing doesnt come near to competing with, for
example, druids. Presumably you'd also agree regarding necros, enchanters,
etc. Given that, claiming they need a nerf seems bizzare.
