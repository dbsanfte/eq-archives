One critical comment - do *not* go into any trade skill with the
expectation of ever making a profit. Yes, it can be done (I made a
huge profit with tailoring), but the effort involved is extreme, and
in general you'll make more money if you spend the time in a dungeon
instead.

Trade skills should be looked upon as nothing more than something that
adds 'color' to the gaming experience. You do them for fun, as a break
from constant fighting, or just to pass the time while you wait for a
friend to show up.

The exception to this is if you plan on doing one of the quests that
require some level of trade skills, such as the Shawl quest. But by
the time you're high enough level to worry about this, the money
required to just skill up without thought to profit/loss is trivial.

>I suppose you could make a profit off of mundane jewelry for a while

Nope, afraid not. Players won't buy mundane jewelry at all, and
merchants will never pay you what the raw materials cost. It's a
losing proposition.

>Fishing: Boring, but you can make a tidy profit at it if you do it 
>long enough

This one, yes, you can earn more money selling to merchants than the
skill costs you, so you can run a small profit. But you'll still be
better off fighting stuff.
