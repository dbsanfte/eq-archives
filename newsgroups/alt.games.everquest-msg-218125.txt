As a 23 bard, I have my hotkeys defined as:
1-2:Direct spell slots(I hit 1, I cast spell 5(Selo's), hit 2, I cast
spell 8(Brusco's Boastful Bellow)
3-4:Sense Heading and Forage, both mapped to my left/right buttons
5:My assist button(one of my three 'global' hotkeys, so I hit
f1(2,3,4,5,6) and 5 to assist.
6-7-8:Primary/Inventory slot1(2/3/4),Secondary(So I don't have to open
my inv. window to juggle instruments.  It's just three quick clicks, and
I hold a weapon(instrument)
9-10:Sneak and Bind Wound

Now, I devote the first four pages of hotkeys to this setup.
Percussion, Strings, Brass(currenty a shield), and Wind.

I twist by doing alt+# for some, and hitting 1-2 for others.  Kinda
tough, but I've gotten used to it.  Alt+1, Alt+2, 2, repeat.

Hope this helps.
