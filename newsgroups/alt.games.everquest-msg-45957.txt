Well I think VI has done their part on the restrictive rules. Still it is
going to be up to the players to make it a role playing server or not. If I
had any kind of imagination at all I would join in. But I don't. I mean

a hard enough time developing my real personality, much less making up a
play one. Still, I would like to.
