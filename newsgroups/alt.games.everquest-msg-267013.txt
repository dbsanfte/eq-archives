I gave EQ2 some time to see how the launch would go, and after only one 
week...the order is in at play.com :-)

I'd like to thank all the regulars here who have been playing EQ2 from 
launch for their well thought out reviews, and also for the detail 
they've put into them. It's really helped me make a slightly more 
informed decision, and they have also been a lot more enjoyable to read 
than the mix of Fan Boi vs Troll reviews that I'm used to reading for 
products :-)

Looking forward to seeing some of you on there when it arrives :-)

Michael Greenhalgh
