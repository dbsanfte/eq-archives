Well, that's too much, IMO. I'm just not sure why, if I have a map, I 
can't jot down a note on it that says "contact here." The minimap is 
basically useless in WoW, I don't think the developers even know why 
they put it in except that it's just a D2/WC3ism. I mean, you can *ping* 
the minimap a la WC3, but you can't lay down thumbtacks?

The problem with WoW is that the terrain is poorly differentiated, 
especially in the case of the NE regions. The ground is all the same 
grassy/mossy stuff and there is very little sense of natural direction.
