Oh ok were you a druid? i forgot. As a druid level 19 is fine I think,
the crags should be blue and what I remember doing is starting from
the barb village in EK, getting one and dragging it down by the shore
THEN snaring it and such. Of course since then they fixed root so now
you could probably snare/root/ dot maybe after nuking it a couple and
do pretty well. 

I THINK for the spiders just inside upper guk its a bit lower, but
they assist each other if too low. If you go with friends though you
should do okay. If you have not been there before and are not with
trolls or ogres, you should probably only be glower with the frogs so
basically unmolested unless spiders assist on you.
