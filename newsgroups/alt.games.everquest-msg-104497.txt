Some time ago I saw a post about a vendor that doubled in the 1000 and was
arguably the worst mob to kill aside from Kerafyrm. Just one of those "do
not harm me" guys :)

Talking about weird mobs, what's up with that named mini-sarnak at the
zone-in of Chardok? It just screams if you hit it and seems to have loads of
hp and good hp-reg.
