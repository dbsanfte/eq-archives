Ben's been posting here since 1999/1/21.
Your earliest post was 2000/12/06.

Me, I've been posting here since 1999/7/8.

On the other hand, elsewhere I've been posting since 1997/02/05

On the gripping hand, Ben beats me because he's got 27 posts earlier
than that, earliest 2 being in May '96.

Google, for things you really wish had been forgotten (except for Biz,
who has all his erased so he'll never have it brought up that he STILL
hasn't tried the recipe I gave him).


For what it's worth, I took a look back at the start of you two's
little snipe-fest.  The following is a summary for those who got in
late:

Danni made an insinuation (yes, insinuation, not accusation).

Ben told him not to make accusations.

Annie pointed out that it was an insinuation.

Ben said she's wrong.

Annie said that it is, IFF you consider any threat to be an attack
(paraphrased).

Ben started flinging monkey doo-doo.


In this case I think Ben's wrong.  It was an insinuation, not an
accusation, and there is a difference.  Further, flinging monkey
doo-doo is *not* the best way to win an argument.


(Why did I do all the above?  I'm bored to tears waiting for dinner to
finish cooking, and too lazy to vacuum the living room while I wait.)
