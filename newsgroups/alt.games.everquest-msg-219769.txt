Basically, there is one only thing that you have to consider: EQ isn't based
on PvP
(unless you are playint on a dedicated server, there are 4 of them i
believe, maybe 5)
UO is pretty much PvP. Even if you want to do trade skill and/or NPC hunting
only,
you will always find someone glad to kick your ass. You can't go outside the
towns,
because right outside the town limits there are PKr's waiting you. You can't
hunt
wildlife cuz someone is waiting to hunt you. This all is very frustrating
for new players.
