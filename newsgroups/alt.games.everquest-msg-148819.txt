I understand I'm not renting space...but consider this- all those Uber
Chracters you've been building up? Kiss em ALL goodbye if you let the
account go longer than 90 days.

I think this was just an "eye-opener" for me that says...pay us

Nothing wrong with it...Sony's rules afterall.
But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

Later :)
