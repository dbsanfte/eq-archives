But Dennis this isn't a sport, its war.  The definition of the Rules
of war is:Anything thats needed to win. Given that the concept of
sportmanship doesn't even enter into it.

Hehe, actually no one mounts their faithfull steeds anywhere but where
the train goes now. Plus the concept of the "lone warrior" Knight
isn't in place this being a MMORPG and thus having hundreds of "heros"
in the game at the same time. As for the stabbing in the back thing,
well, ambush is and always has been a part of war. Even the brits in
the revolutionary war with their stiff "stand in a straight line on
open fields in bright day glo uniforms" managed an ambush or two.
