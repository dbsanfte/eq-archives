I wouldn't call it a short gap.  The satellites are about 22000 miles up, so
even if you were right below them, round trip time from your machine to
satellite to server back to satellite to your machine includes 88000 miles,
which is 470 milliseconds at the speed of light.

Have you checked with your phone company to see what business services are
available in your area?  ISDN is available almost everywhere, although many
phone companies make it hard to find out how to order it.
