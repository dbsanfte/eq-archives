Duration spells aren't affected by foci and/or AAs?  Or just Foci?  I
have an improved healing focus as well as most healing AAs on my
Ranger.  I obviously can't cast my own HoT (well not really) but when I
use a potion I notice that it heals for a different amount each tic.  I
assumed this was because my improved healing focus and AAs were kicking
in.  I know that it won't crit heal, but the others all seem to help.

Just to derail this futher, is there a cap on how much a heal spell can
do?  On my Ranger, I believe I have all healing adept AAs (with a
couple healing gift missing or possibly the other way around, can't
remember) as well as the improved healing V aug from Stillmoon.  Since
the last time I bought a Healing Adept AA I have noticed that I never
(non-crit) heal for more than 1700.  I often heal for less but I also
get quite few heals for exactly 1700 and never any more.  Maybe it's
just dumb luck that when all the random numbers are perfect, they
multiply to give an even 1700 but I was wondering if maybe this was
some kind of hard cap.
