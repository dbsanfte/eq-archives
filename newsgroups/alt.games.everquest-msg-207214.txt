Even your "rightists" are leftists. 

How many Support the Right to Bear Arms? How many support a TRUE Free
Market? How many oppose the EU? How many support the idea of a smal,
weak federal government? How many support the idea of a free country? 

I can think of Switzerland, and even IT is having issues. I'll give
Holland a nod for the way they handle Pot and other recreational
drugs, although that's more of a Libertarian leaning than a left/right
leaning. 

Face it, you're on a continent full of mini Communists that are
slowing castrating you. And most of you are asking them to do more of
the same. The EU is your new master. Bow down and grab yer ankles.
Uunfortunately, a lot of what's happening there is also happening on
this side of the pond, albeit a little more slowly.

But I'm sure you're going to sit there and sneer at my comments, all
the while you're paying 60% of your net income in taxes and telling
yourself that somehow, someone who doesn't want to work is more
entitled to your money than you are.
