    What about the people who play sports which requires them to work
excessively to keep up their condition and skills, usually practically fight
each other, sometimes use drugs of various kinds to increase performance
abilities, and those who stay home from work to watch a game or play a game?
    And what about those people who can't get out to do much, like not being
able to drive has a BIG disadvantage.  Sure people say "well someone can
just take you" but that doesn't work.  It goes from going places with people
to "who's turn is it to pick him up" and going out with friends soon becomes
going out with people you know, to being a duty for a few people to perform,
then soon later finding new people to be with.  However EverQuest and other
online activities are different because you can go places and be with people
without having to leave home.  The Internet is where most of my interaction
has been.  I spent about 90% of my life without it and that didn't make
anything great so what would make someone think that the other 10% with NO
Internet (just as the first 90%) would make any difference?  And to those
anti-technology type who say "you'll never know for sure until you try",
take your words and shove them up your ___ and try something you oppose for
a change, and WITHOUT a bias (sp?) attitude towards it and make it work just
as you tell other people to do.  I've seen many who had no social life until
the Internet was available for them.  And when you play EverQuest remember
that the characters (other than the NPCs and enemies) are actually real
humans.  So that LV50 who dies to save your LV25 life and has now lost a few
hours of play time, that is a person who is obviously very nice.  I really
don't see an extremely nice character being played by a mean person.  The
other way around maybe, but still not completely accurate.  Even though you
try to hide it, a person's true personality will be somewhat present in
their online form.  It may be harder to detect in some more than others.
Online worlds can often be better than the real world which is what draws so
many people.  And like they mentioned, that some people use EverQuest as an
escape and become addicted, those people obviously would have used anything,
and had problems to begin with.
    About a year ago wasn't it video game violence they were targeting (with
the school shootings)?  Before that wasn't it TV and movies, and music, and
nearly every major technology that comes along?
    I know how to fix the main society problems.  Take these people who go
looking for trouble in every new thing and completely wipe them from the
earth, leaving no evidence that they ever existed, and prevent new ones from
replacing them or do the same thing again as soon as someone else starts.
    From what I've seen, people who look for a problem in someone else's
activities often are only doing it to hide something far worse about them.
Ever notice how the most super-religious people are the ones who have had
the worst backgrounds? (whole other story all together on that one.  I had a
high school teacher, who after we had all been talked to by someone the
school had come in to speak to everybody, said "All they are doing is
verifying that even after having the worst life you can, and getting into so
much trouble that there is virtually no way out, it is still possible to
make a complete turn around. They are only telling you that you don't have
to change now, you can get much worse and still change later.  Why don't
they just bring in a prostitute to tell everybody not to have sex?")
