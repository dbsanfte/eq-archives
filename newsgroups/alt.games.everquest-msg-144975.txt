Mana and INT have a curious relationship.  What you want, of course, is
mana.  However, to get it, it may be a better idea in the long run for you
to purchase INT items.  This is because your mana total is based on your
level and INT, with mana items added to the end.  The precise formula
escapes my memory (I"m sure it will show up in this thread) but in general,
a point of INT at level 25 is the equivalent of 5 points of mana... and as
you level up, that INT will produce more mana while the straight mana items
just sit there; at level 50 the same point of INT is worth 10 mana.

INT has its limits, though, when you hit 200 INT, you stop getting the
multiplication effect based on your level, and instead get a "mere" 5.6
mana per INT, up to the hard cap at 255 INT.  The hard cap on mana
items is much higher, not something you are going to hit without getting
much higher level (like most 60's characters aren't there yet) And mana
items tend to be much cheaper, point for point, assume for the sake
of arguement that you can get 5 mana per point of INT, in terms of cost.

Another, more subtle, advantage to getting INT over mana is that INT
will have an effect on how quickly you learn most skills.  For most uses,
this isn't a significant advantage, most combat skills/spell skills will go
up plenty fast enough on their own, but an ardent trade skiller should get
as much as he can, and for the rest, well, its a little bonus for going the
INT route.

Asking here is really not going to get you far, prices vary wildly from server
to server, and even during a single day on a single server; there are no
good resources for prices anymore, the ones I used to rely on got funnier and
funnier pre bazaar, and are now completely useless.  Seriously, don't worry
too much about getting ripped off, go shop.

Here's the trick if you want to be "safe", never buy anything with only one
seller listing it.  Tree or four people selling something, its highly unlikely
you
are looking at a wildly overpriced deal.  And since you are interested in
what is, frankly, the low end of items, there's little reason to collude to rip
you off.  WHile I might be tempted to get together with a friend and
artificially jack up the price of my Mosquito Eye Earring by having him
list one at an even higher price, doing the same thing with a preserved
split paw eye isn't even an option in the larcenous dream time where I
keep such shabby schemes.
