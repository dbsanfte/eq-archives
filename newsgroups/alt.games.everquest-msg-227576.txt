You know what the main problem with strings like that is?  I can't see half
of them.  The lines get chopped badly.  I might see something along the
lines of:

"By the Power of my                                        nd sundered!"

This only happens with the RP-happy, use 40 words instead of 10,
declarations of undying whatever.  Same thing with 3-line long statements of
"incoming".  If the statement is "Mezzing %T" I see all of it.  If it's
"Incoming %T", I know what's arriving.  But what do I do when the message
is:

"Bringing in a %T.  Stomp on it's toes and pull it's nose"

and all I see is "Bringing in a a_dec                                   ull
it's nose"?
