He didn't do it on Povar because there is no Povar board. Unlike many other
high population servers, Povar has no organized board, rotations, etc..

>>>"people who act like you"<<<

Hmmm. You don't know Av at all. I do. Av is a quality player who is well
thought of on his server by many across several also well thought of guilds
(albeit not necessarily "uber" guilds). How would you propose to know "how
he acts?" What? From one post looking for a pool of candidates?

Funny thing when you're thinking of starting out a guild, but you don't want
to ravage the membership of guilds that you have great relationships with -
how do you find good players? It's a Catch 22 - you want players that are of
good quality/character (implying that you know them), but you don't want to
"steal" from guilds that you want to remain friends with. I would imagine
that you would begin looking for a pool of folks to "get to know". You
might, for example, make it widely known that you're starting a new guild
and looking for recruits - note, however, that this does not mean that
you're going to automatically invite everyone that responds.

Cut the guy some slack.
