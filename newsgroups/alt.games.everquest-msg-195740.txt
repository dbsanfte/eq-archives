	E'ci's public has killed at least one of the Zek brothers, and maybe both,
and should be working on Rallos soon.  I haven't been there for any of this,
unfortunately; I don't have the long blocks of RL time needed to level at this
point, and the public raid leader moved the minimum past my level (62) a while
ago.  He just raised it again to 65 this week.
