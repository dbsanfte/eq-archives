I read somewhere about a new feature in Luclin which enables a player to
become a shopkeeper to sell their stuff, while being away from the computer.
In the eqclient.ini file their is a set of parameters for the bazaar window,
which I presume refers to this.
Also read that their was a problem with it. I cant find any info about this
or any latest developments on the official site of any other.
Anyone know what is going on with this.
