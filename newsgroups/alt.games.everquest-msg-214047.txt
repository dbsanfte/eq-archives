Hello all,

I have recently created a Barbarian Beastlord on Firiona Vie. The server
sounded interesting after following the recent discussions here. On
Drinal, I have an 18 Ogre Beastlord and someone talked me through
creating an alternate Vah Shir and run through the citizenship quest 3
times to get faction and do the claw quest. It was quite fun, and I have
completed up to the gathering the 2 Sonic Wolfling Molars. My question
is how would I do this on Firiona Vie? I am loathe to ask anyone, as it
is time consuming on their part and the one character limit on Firiona
Vie make asking anyone there impossible. My Barbarian is already level
9, so I don't want to delete it and start over with a Vah Shir. Any
suggestions, or should I just forget it?
