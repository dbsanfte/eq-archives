That was pretty funny.  I would have laughed more had I not been at work.

It was weird to find JBoots for sale; on every other server, they're
no-drop.  The possibility of buying Monual a bunch of stuff that's curretnly
tagged no-drop makes me drool.  I *so* wanna get rid of my SS breastplate.

Don't y'all have Soulbinders on FV?  On Drinal, there's a soulbinder inside
the lighthouse of Gunthak.

Hehehe... okay, maybe.  Still, that would have been a lousy way to help ya.

Hehe... I was actually half-fearing and half-hoping for aggro, just so I
could try Lenny out.  But I remember once visiting my good friend Kayia in
real life, and she let me use her ranger to attack a hill giant.  After
about two minutes of me whacking away at it, she told me to run away, which
I did.  She then took over and proceeded to do half-a-dozen other things I
hadn't been doing - cast Spell A, right-click inventory items B and C, etc.
She took the hill giant out a lot more quickly than I ever could have, and
taking a lot less damage, too.  I was afraid of trying to fight with Lenny;
what might be easy pickings for him could be a potentially lethal battle for
me.  Still, I've had some experience with melee getting Marrtuk leveled up
so I wasn't *too* worried.  Discretion being the better part, though, was
foremost in my mind.

I figured it was something like that.

I was kinda thinking that too... that some ISP's have tightened up their
routers and switches in light of the attack, thus making things difficult on
people like you and Lenny.

Yeah, probably.  I was spending a lot of time manually editing xml files and
then loading them with /loadskin.  And after a /loadskin your chat window
gets wiped clean of text.  Who knows what all I missed; I should probably
have put AFK up, if I'd thought of it.

Hehe... just wait until peridot costs hit home.  That's when you'll feel All
Grown Up and Poor As Dirt.

Heh... I would like have let out a bit more than that.  =)

It was no waste... even if it ended up not helping, it was worth the effort,
and it was fun experiencing a new server.

/afk to cancel PlayerAuctions listing.

Absolutely.  I've given my password out twice to people I trust a great
deal, so that they could accomplish a specific task with my account.  As
soon as that task was done (once to get flagged, once to get rezzed and
gated from the old Plane of Air), I changed the password.

Changing your passwords helps my peace of mind as well, because if something
*does* go seriously wrong with your account later on, I can't be held
accountable.

Exactly.

OMG, not QOS?  That's a pretty useless protocol, I have no clue why that's
enabled by default on XP.

Awesome.  Glad it was that simple to fix for ya.  =)

See above.  =)  I would have celebrated with you.

Hehe.  I am thinking of finally caving in and getting a second account to
move Marrtuk to.  I could start an FV character at the same time.  =)  It
depends; there have been rumblings in the guild lately about alts.  It came
to a head when we fought Hydrotha when it spawned very late one night and
wiped with it at 1% - while an SK was logged on her alt, leveling it up.  So
people are beginning to complain about people playing alts rather than
concentrating on mains.

> Thank you again for the time and effort you put out to help us.

You're welcome.  Glad to see you back - would have missed you, in the chat
channel and in the newsgroup if you'd left.  Now, get to level 49 so you can
get bugged endlessly for rezzes!
