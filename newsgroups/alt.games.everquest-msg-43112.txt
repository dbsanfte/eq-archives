Research components can be found on almost any critter that gives experience
for that spell level to 5 levels higher.  In other words, if you're looking
for words for a level 24 spell (which I think is what you are looking for),
hunt in a zone that's good for a 24-29. LIO certainly falls into that
category but it's not the only zone.

And definitely check each and every vendor you come across, no matter where
you happen to be at the time.  This was by far my best source of components.
