The intelligent folk understood.

I like the fact that newbie zones have some quick-death mobs running around 
once in a while.  I still remember hunting in Steamfont with my first 
character - my Wizard was around level 5, and so was my mage partner and 
bard partner.  We were hunting at what we called "Kobold 1" and out of 
nowhere, I was dead.  Never saw what hit me.  The other 2 died very soon 
afterwards.

I found out it was that troll-bitch and found out her level, and swore that 
we would come back and slay her some day.  That's about the only mob I have 
ever had a lot of hatred towards, having never died at the hands of Gix or 
a Dragoon or Slate or Dorn, etc..

Danger is what makes the game fun to me.  We went to Mistmoore for the 
first time last night to get the mask for my Enchanter.  That place looks 
like a train nightmare!  Which, in my book, equates to fun.  Well, except 
when you have been playing your warrior for a long time and forget about 
the canines that are hanging around your quest mob.  That AOE stun was a 
definite brain-fart moment - 3rd time I have hit that stun in an 
inappropriate place.

Now that I have been to Mistmoore, I want to go back.  We need a few more 
quest items from there, so it's time to read up on it.
