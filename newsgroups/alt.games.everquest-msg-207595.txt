Here in the US, although the claim is 56.6k, the actual maximum 
connection speed allowed, and possible over standard phone lines using a 
56.6k modem, is 53k.  I used to live in a place where I could get that 
too, now, the best I can do is 26.4k with a modem.  Have not used one for 
quite some time however.
