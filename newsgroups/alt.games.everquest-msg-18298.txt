1. Get ATA100 on the motherboard
2. I wouldn't buy a 20GB drive when you can get 40 or 60 GB for so little
more.  Make sure it's 7200RPM.
3. I'd get 256 + 128MB RAM, or 512MB.  Fry's electronics has 512MB PC133 for
$89!
4. Don't sweat getting a sound blaster live.  Its the #1 selling card out
there -- it's safe.
5. Take your hard drive out of your old computer and put it into your new
computer.   You can continue to run it from there or copy it from there onto
your new hard drive
6. Dunno why you want Win98 instead of ME...
7. I'd go ABIT SL6 as a mboard...
