*Chuckle* Okay, fine. Remeber that next time you see someone
killstealing, intentionally training, or whatnot.

Listen, boy: As a player of the game, I have every right to call a
violation of the rules to their attention. If you can't grasp this
concept, two words: GROW UP. You've obviously fallen to the elementry
school "tattle tale!" mentality...

Because I *agreed* to those rules and respect them, those around me
should. Because he is violating the rules he agreed to, he should take
whatever consequences are due. Instead of sloughing the blam off on
others, he should take accountability for actions he took in knowing
violation of the rules under his own free will. It's called "being a
grown-up". Maybe in a few years, you'll begin to understand.

You have a real problem with authority, don't you?

Grow up.

Well, that explains a lot...
