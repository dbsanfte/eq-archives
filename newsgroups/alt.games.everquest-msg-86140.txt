Damn, 5k damage, isn't that about all the HPs most of those mobs have?  
How long were your fights lasting?

Well, I think SKs finally get impressive when they're weilding 49damage, 
42 delay weapons.  I guess they finally bitched enough that they do some 
decent damage now.

Generally I'm wielding 10/18 in primary, 16/26 in off-hand.  If I'm the 
only tank though I'll start off with 16/26 primary, 13/26 off-hand until 
my epic procs the first time.  A free 60% haste is nice, and once I'm 
hasted it will proc enough in the off-hand to keep it up.  I only have the 
gimpy PoA bard haste belt though, 16% or something equally useless.  I 
gave the FBSS to an unhasted friend, and haven't gotten anything better 
yet.

Well, bard charm only works on mobs level 51 and below, and it looks like 
some Krups are higher than that, along with some of the scarabs.  I know 
I've charmed them in the past, but and I can't remember a too high to 
charm message, but I generally rely on mezz for CC.  I have done the charm 
and assist my pet method in guard, but not in necro, so that may explain 
the difference.
