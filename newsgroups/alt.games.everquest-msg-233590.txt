You've got to be kidding... I recently switched back to the old models
to improve performance during raids, and I find the old models very
unappealing, mostly.  There are a few that are ok, but mostly, the
proportions are so inhuman .  They are WAY too skinny, for one thing. 
And for the most part, all the females looks like barbie dolls.  At
least in the "new" models, the races look pretty different from each
other and, I think, are closer to human proportions (except for the
breasts, of course!)
