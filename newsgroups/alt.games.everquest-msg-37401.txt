Ah, you're level 39 and I'm assuming you don't have a druid 14+ or enchanter
16+ so you're only now starting to get pestered...only now is /role and
/anon starting too look good to you.

Both my druid & enchanter reached their magic number long before my brother
got his cleric up to 49+.   With time, and if you don't cop out and go into
hiding ALL the time you get used to being pestered.  Seriously.  Of course,
most clerics, druids and enchanters are cop-outs terrified someone will ask
them for a rez or sow or clarity (EEK!).

It's a lot easier for me NOW to say "no, sorry, can't" and just leave it at
that than it was at 14/16.  Of course, I said "no" a lot less until my druid
hit 29...after all, if the person is standing next to me I RARELY have a
problem casting sow/clarity on them, but my enchanter actually gets tells
asking to deliver a clarity (as if!!) and they both get asked to wait where
they are for 5 minutes while the person comes to me.  Sorry, a lot of the
time I'm going somewhere...I don't WANT to wait around 5 minutes that
inevitably turns out to be 10.

Wow, talk about rambling.  You'll get used to politely saying no.  And those
who put up any argument...hell, just start ignoring their tells (don't even
have to put them on /ignore).  As to your Unrest situation, tell them that
there's a 3-hour online timer for rezzes, and you SHOULD be able to help
them before then.  "You're trying to avoid the run?  Damn, sorry, I can't
help you, I'm busy.  When you get here, please drag your corpse to me, don't
train us, and I'll rez you then."
