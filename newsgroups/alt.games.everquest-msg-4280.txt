This is like the 12th posting you've made like this. STOP trying to impress
us! I'm sure that the others will agree with me. With all your posts as a
resume of ridicule, you couldn't get a job cleaning the grease pits of
Burger King. Let along make us think your are even close to having
more intelligence than slime mold.

If you wish to be treated like an intelligent human being and not the
inbred backwoods retard that you are then stop posting the stupid
shit you do.

Plain and simple.
