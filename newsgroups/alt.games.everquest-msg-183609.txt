Wow I wish I'd read this before tonight :(  Was in a decent group in DL, 
our tank left and a rogue overpulled, we wiped.  I was like 3 blues from 
40 when a druid /ooc'd lfg - the sow would really help while grouping, 
not to mention backup heals, so I said I'd give up my spot in group for 
him and just Trep my way to 40.

3 trips later, I am a bit richer, and SEVERELY unpleased. >:(
