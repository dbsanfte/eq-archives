70 at the moment.

Hmm... from most important...

AE taunt.
Natural Durability 3
Run speed 3
Physical Enhancement
Flurry 3 (Cause it's fun!)
Raging Flurry 1 (see above)
Combat avoidance 2
Combat stability 1
Punishing Blade 1
Combat Fury 3 (cause it's required for flurry, boo)

> What are you planning to get next?

Probably Combat Avoidance 3.  I need to catch up on my "good tank" skills,
after possibly one too many "fun skills".... Although Raging Flurry 2 is
mighty tempting, as are Ferocity 1, and Punishing Blade 2...

Just Raging Flurry 1.   Once I bought it, it actually appears that I flurry
less than with plain old Flurry 3.  Not counting Combat Fury, which I had to
take as a prerequisite.  I'd dump that in a heartbeat.
