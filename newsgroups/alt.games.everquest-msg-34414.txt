I would have had words with her. Some beggars have been trained to think
that if they run to the tunnel in EC, or the Dock in Oasis, bigger folks
will help them. So pick out a red, fight it down to half, and run for
help. Fast XP! I may help the first occurance of this, in case there is
someone who really needs it, but this seems to only encourage them to
come back with more.

I would not tolerate this behaviour in a guildmate, and will not buff
those that pester me like this. I would find out who an officer is in
that guild, and let them know how their comrade is behaving.

Yes, I petition horrid names too.
