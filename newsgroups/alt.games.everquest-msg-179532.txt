The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"

Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight

Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies

Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand

Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Carry on
Or we have to pay the price

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head

I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love
