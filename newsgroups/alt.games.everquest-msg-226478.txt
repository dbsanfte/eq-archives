'Free with purhcase' has a separate price tag as well. Coca-Cola free 
with 30.00 fillup... or 1.89. So if you don't have a car you aren't 
required to pump gas onto the street to get a 2-litre.

And 2 for one deals again assume that you can buy them separately, (but 
often for exactly the same price each.) So if EQ2 beta was available 
separately for 50.00 and LoE was available for 50.00 then the 2-for-1 
bundle would be a value-add. But EQ2 beta is no way worth 50.00...that's 
the whole problem.

But if EQ2 beta is worth 10.00 and LoE is worth 50.00 then 2-for-1 at 
50.00 dollars is only a value add if you want *both*. Otherwise you are 
better off buying them separately (ie just buying the beta)... but for 
some reason that isn't an option.

Of course. But there are temporal issues that make EQ2 a tough product 
to subsitute for EQ2 beta if someone doesn't get into beta.
