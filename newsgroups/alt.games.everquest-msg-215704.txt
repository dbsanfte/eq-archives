The newbie armor quests are pretty good. If it was me, I would use the
shared platinum slot and buy up that you can find on vendors. Reason is I
like to get to Qeynos ASAP with my int casters.

I think the newb armor quest does everything but ears, shoulders, back,
neck, belt, secondary weapon. It has been a while since I have looked at
them so I am sure I have forgotten some.

In the Qeynos catacombs there is the Cubert quest. You get an extended
affliction I
-gold stud- for your ear with +3 int. These sell for ~50 pp but you can
quest it somewhere around level 5 and get experience while you are doing it
so cost zero. Ear #1

A polished bone hoop with mana preservation I is a good newbie twink item
for the other ear. The price seems a bit high on the ones I have seen, ~50
pp, but it is worth it for your first 20 levels. Ear #2

The -elemental binder- is heavy but *cheap*. I have seen these go for as
little as 6 pp. Must have head gear for a newb mage IMO.

Stein of Moggok is a good int caster item. Prices range everywhere from
25-200 pp. You can use the shared bank to let your chanter use it too. I
have 2 druids and a chanter that can do this quest on 3 different servers so
I have never had to pay for one. Secondary taken care of.

For your rings I would suggest getting in tight with Priest of Life and
picking up a band of Rodcet Life. Best way would use the PoK books to get
regurgatonic/fish for hand in after you kill a bunch of gnolls. Maybe you
could go the SK fish killer route if you have an extra slot. Make sure you
have faction in any case. I think you need amiable.

If you have been killing some gnolls, you may have enough Karana Residents
faction to do the Miller bear/wolf armor quests. If you don't, you can ask
someone to do the turn in for you. You can get boots, belt, cloak for
different qualities of bear and wolf skins. The bear hide boots have
extended enhancement I on them which will help with burnout spell.

That should take care of everything but neck and one finger. Maybe 160 pp
worth of stuff. You could get something like a silver rose engagement ring
or maybe something like a catseye necklass for a few charisma. You may want
to invest in an opal encrusted stein to handle your low charisma when
selling to vendors.

Even if you don't find every piece or do every quest, assuming you dumped 20
points into in, your int will be ~160 by the time you hit level 16. That is
plenty for a mage.
