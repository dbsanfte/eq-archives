Giants, hmmm
Trolls, Ogres, Barbarians

Mini People (great name)
Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes

Think that about covers it.

I don't see any point in pushing the racial size ends to an extreme, I see
no advantage in playing a character that small (about the size of a bixie
but unable to fly) and the other would not be able to enter cities or
dungeons (except kael drakel) Shrink only does so much and even then I'd
imagine something twice the size of a Sand Giant would still be larger than
a troll, even shrunk by a high level shaman.

If anything I'd like there to be more diversity within the existing races eg
I'd like to play an Oriental looking Monk rather than one that looks like
Tony Iommi. I know the reason for keeping this out of EQ is to avoid racism
in the game although I don't believe Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic or Oriental
looking Human would cause a problem, the racism in game seems to gear toward
the fantasy races, mainly Dark Elves but also Dwarves and Halflings, I may
be wrong.

Personally, I think I should be able to play the mortal son of Inoruuk and
have the power of a Demi God, I did petition this asking a GM why I couldn't
be a Demi God, he explained that there already were Demi Gods roaming
Norrath, they are called Merchants.
