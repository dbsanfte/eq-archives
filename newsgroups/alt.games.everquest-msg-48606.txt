My suggestions would be:

Head: Coldstone Wreath (Skyshrine), Nightshade Wreath (MM off Maid Isis) or
Runed Circlet (Perma off the Preacher)
Wrists: RMB, Chipped Bone Bracelets (various zones off ogres) or even Polished
Bone Bracers (Gorge off Evil Eyes)
Legs: Kromriff Military Legs (if you can get a few friends to help with final
step of the quest) or Gator Legs (Upper Guk off Ancient Croc)
Feet: GEBs are nice and they are coming down in price. Wolf Fur Slippers (Perma
off the Scryer) or even Dwarven Work Boots (Unrest off the Ghost)
Back: Mammoth Hide Cloak (Perma off the Alchemist) or Cloak of the Ry'Gorr
Oracles (Crystal Caverns off Oracles)

You should definitely hit Perma. At 45, you can camp the cloak, circlet and feet
all at one go. As for ES armor, it's okay; but heavy as hell. The only parts I
use regularly are the arms; but I switch out other pieces in special
circumstances. Wouldn't go overboard trying to get it though, other than the
arms; there is better stuff that is easier to obtain out there.
