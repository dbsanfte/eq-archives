Trying to figure out strategy for fighting with my baby necro. At level
12 I've got too many cool spells! Ack! Only eight slots. *sigh*. So I'm
looking for some help in getting the most effective selection of spells
for battle situations. Currently, I usually mem Deadeye, Minor
Shielding, and my pet spell, cast all them, set the pet to guard, forget
those three, and then mem the following for hunting:

Lifedraw (name? anyway, the 12th level life tap)
Fear
Poison Bolt
Engulfing Darkness
Heat Blood
Leach
Dark Pact
Gate

I don't know why I even bother memming Fear, as I never cast it. Too
much mana and not long lasting enough for me to effectively fear kite
anything yet. I guess I just keep it for emergencies, but I've yet to
use it in fighting except for some early experiments. I could lose it
for another if that's wise.

When fighting where it's primarily or exclusively undead, I'll swap out
Leach for the undead DD nuke. (Dismiss Undead, or whatever it's called.)

Does this lineup make sense? Or is there a better strategy I should be
employing? Currently, my usual tactic is to start off with dark pact,
med a second, /pet guard here, pull with Darkness, /pet attack, poison
bolt, heat blood, then jump in and help the pet in melee for a while. If
it's a big yellow with a lot of point, I may back out part way through
and toss in Leach to finish him off and get back the points I've lost in
melee. (It's a great spell by the way. Sucks points out of them even
after they die. he he.) But if I have to cast all of those in one fight,
even with dark pact running, I'm pretty much OOM by the end and am
looking at down time. That's why I've been trying to stick with blues
and evens, as a simple darkness and poison bolt while pet is attaking,
and me jumping in melee with dark pact is enough to beat them with pet
at fair health and me ready to go again as soon as the battle is over.
