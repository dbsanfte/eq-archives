Hmmm, didn't notice the wood elf thing.  I'm more of a scenery guy I
guess.

I think the UI might just be a hotkey away though.  I currently do
that in EQ when soloing as it is.  I like how the UI is pretty
unobtrusive for the most part.  They really want to show the world
off.

I got a chance to see some more of them, and combat looks alright.
Leaps and bounds ahead of current EQ.  Still not all the way there.

And I really liked when the Iksar was swimming through the choppy
water at the base of the waterfall.  Very cool.

And for the things that bugged me:
- lack of sound for the Golems (or Earth Ele's) when moving in the
Mage's Tower.  If I can hear my footsteps, those things should be
shaking the earth.
- the pop-up damage numbers feel like they're from a Nintendo game
(Final Fantasy?)
- the word balloons over the speakers head.  Pick one of the three, I
think.

I'm sure they've learned their lessons in UI from the Original EQ
though, so I think the last 2 are likely configurable.  Now they just
need the sound of rocks moving across the earth.
