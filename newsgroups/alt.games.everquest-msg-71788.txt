   Bah.  Don't make a druid.  We have enough
druids.
   My very first character in EQ was a WE druid.  
I was happy, running around slaying bats and 
decaying skellies.  Then, a line from an /ooc 
conversation that I had been ignoring caught my
eye.  It read "Dude, over 80% of the people in this
city are druids!"
    I don't what prompted that remark.  I didn't
know how to do a /who to confirm if it might be
true.  I just know that it struck a cord with me.
I didn't want to play the most common of characters.
I immediately started some other character, who
is now lost in the mists of time (Tealeef was my
first character that I kept, and I had been playing
for a few weeks before I created her).

Annie  <--- Doesn't hate druids, though.  At least not
always.

Living in the universe known as Drinal

Teashot -- Wood Elf Ranger, 26, back to killing lake
lizards.
Tealeef -- Barbarian Shaman, 23, deleveling in Najena.
Teabomb -- Gnome Wizard, 17, blasting lizards by the lake.
Teaword -- Dark Elf Magician, 13, burning in Lavastorm.
Teadead -- Human Necromancer, 6, terrorizing the Commons.
Teacure -- High Elf Cleric, 2, ruining Crushbone lands.
Teaclaw -- Ogre Beastlord, 1, trying to find her way out of
the city.
