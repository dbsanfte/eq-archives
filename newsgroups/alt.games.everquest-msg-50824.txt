Ive heard over the media, that a "recession" is defined to be 2 consecutive
terms of negative growth in the economy. (dont ask me what a "term" is) This
is pretty meaningless when applied to EQ, as there is no measurement or even
definition of "growth". So "recession" doesnt really have a specific meaning
when applied to eq, and thus means different things to different people.

The prices in eq are declining. I think this decline is sure to happen
whether or not new stuff comes into the game. A case of oversupply vs
demand. I think the correct economic term is "glut". I suppose you could say
"prices are in recession".
