I fixed mine.  Disabled the i chip and installed a 64mb geforce2 mx400 from
best buy for $99.  Very nice!
Best buy has the 32mb for $79.  I was going to buy SOL buy they didn't have
it.  All they had was the $9.99 original and the $39.99 Trilogy.  Can I
still buy Velious?  That and SOL are the only things I don't have.
