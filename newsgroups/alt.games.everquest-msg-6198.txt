Best guess would be some of the coldain down in the depths of
Crystal Cavern.  However, I can assure you that that has been
tried in the past... more than likely this quest is not yet in the
game.  Currently, in fact, there seems to be no way to increase
faction with that set of coldain, and only those with faction
adjusting abilities (bards, enchanters) or sneak have been
able to deal with them at all.
