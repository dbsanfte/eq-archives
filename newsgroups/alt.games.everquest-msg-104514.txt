No, it can't.

You CAN pickpocket the notes at 40 (I had a rogue
do one at 36, but he aggro'd the GM two times first).

You can get all the robes you'd need for the Cazic
Quill at level 40, which is pretty neat, because all of
the places give exp there, too.

You CANNOT get the Book of Souls from Hate until
at LEAST 46, unless you get it MQ'd, which won't
happen at 46 because...

You CANNOT get the notes combined, or translated,
or turned in the the Book of Souls at 40.  You CANNOT
turn in the four robes at 40 for a Cazic Quill.  You
CANNOT do any of the parts if you're not a rogue,
either, for all the same reason.

The quest giver will eat everything until it's done by
a 50+ rogue.

Which is not far off of many other epics, with some
pieces obtainable at much earlier levels than the level
to actually "do" the quests.

I had everything for my Ragebringer second-time
around at level 50.  Except for the Kedge Robe (
no Quill for me from the General).  I would have finished
my epic then, but Phinny and Coercer Q'uiol were being
stingy.  I exp'd enough in Kedge Keep over a week
as well as killing every spawn of DE's in the house
that I dinged into 51 the day before I got my Kedge.

On the same note, I also know both a SK and a Warrior
that had their epics at 50.  The RB is NOT an EASY quest
in the same vein as "Give me two legionnaire shoulderpads
and one legionnaire bracer" is easy.  It simply takes less
time.  Hell, the cleric epic is a piece of cake, except for the
long wait times.  Does long wait==hard work? Not a bit.
Long wait just means more tedious. Tedious /=hard work.

Is the rogue epic easy? No.  Is the rogue epic easier than
the enchanter epic? Yes.  One has to be the easiest, and
one has to be the most difficult.  Don't forget that at the time
the epic weapons were put in the game, rogues were not
a dime-a-dozen or one of the top 3 raid-needed classes.
The amount of 50+ rogues was like the amount of Erudite
Paladins.

"Freebringer" just always kinda cheesed me off.  The
day I got my General's box, there were 2 level 57+
rogues that still didn't have their epics.  The other rogue
in my alt's guild didn't get his epic until 58.  This is
his alt, also, following a level 60 druid that had his epic
(as a first character) at 50.  Go figure...
