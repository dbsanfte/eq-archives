Well, that's why you hit F8 to target the mob to die, hit attack, and
then hit F1 twice to select your pet so you're ready to recharm.  You
might want to send a polite tell to a bard that keeps charming the
wrong mob.  That said, sometimes lag messes things up like you
wouldn't believe.  I've had charm last 30 seconds, I've had both mobs
look charmed, and be unable to be attacked, and I've had both mobs run
off like lost pets.  Generally as soon as I see ANY odd lag I switch
to mez, tell folks I'm lagging, and hope the cleric has root memmed.
