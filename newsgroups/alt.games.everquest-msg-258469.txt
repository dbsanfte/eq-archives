Well, thought I'd post this and see if anyone can come up with any items I
should watch for in the bazaar, or quests that I could complete with minimal
flags.  (2 fights away from Elementals, have GoD but have not gone there
yet.)

The most obvious would be getting ornate armor to replace my Skyshrne quest
gear, but I'm not all that rich, and I don't tend to make platinum very
quick.  So I'm working on that, but it won't likely be soon.

The profile I have posted uses my VP neck, but I tend to throw in my 41%
haste there, when I don't need the extra 150 hp.   When I do need the hp, I
use this neck and tribute haste, so if anyone has an idea on a 41 or 36
percent haster that is attainable, and won't kill one of my high hp slots,
I'm interested in that as well.


Feel free to make LDoN suggestions, but we don't go there all that often, so
big ticket items from adventure points are likely out of reach.  Heh, have
my next 1000 points spent before I even get them. : )
