I've noticed that I'm much more prone to accept and use abbreviations
I don't associate with d00dspeak. From the day I started on chats,
people who thought you and u were equivalent lost points with me, and
the same goes with plz, thx, or referring to me as a dr00d. Shammies,
wizzies, rez, omw (useful when you're running in DL tunnel), lfg,
inkies etc. aren't associated with that in my mind, so I have no
problems. There's a huge difference between convenient abbreviations
and kewl ones, and plz/thx are in the latter category.
