ServerFilter=[0-1] &#8211; 0=No, 1=Yes.  
If this line is set to 1, than Server side filtering is occurring. 
Default is 0.  If you are having problems with lag in a raid
situation, or when many other players are in the same general area in
Everquest, it is best to have this set to 1.
____________________
This is what is says in the Eq_supp.doc, What does it mean, and what
effect is there by switching it on or off, to the Game I mean, the
default is 0, and if the manual recommends setting to 1 if you get lag
when its busy; why wouldn't it be 1 by default. I assume you must lose
something when you set it to 1, if so what ?
