"There were 11,441 recorded rapes last year, according to latest police 
figures"
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3074845.stm

The article discusses whether the rate of sexual crime is really 
increasing, or it's a result of better reporting. Unless I suddenly 
can't read English, it does not conclude that more women are being raped 
this year because fewer are carrying guns.

I'll go with police figures over surveys, if it's all the same to you.

>>290  million. (source: US Department of Justice)

That's because most women in the UK used to carry concealed firearms in 
the 1980s. Oh, wait, I don't think they actually did.

A friendly word of advice concerning debating on Usenet... Don't tell 
somebody to "go look it up" when you'd prefer they didn't bother.
