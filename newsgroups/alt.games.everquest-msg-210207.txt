I get 2 different types of problems after selecting my character.  The
first one results in the screen freezing with the character still
showing.

The 2nd problem is when it takes longer to log into that character
than normal, at least 2 go-rounds of the theme song, sometimes 3.

In both scenarios I do eventually get in, but the second I move or do
any type of action, the lagmeter goes nuts, showing 80-90% packet
loss.

This happens at least half the time I try to login.  Eventually I just
get disgusted and coldboot my machine, after which I can usually log
in fine.  I seriously doubt it is my ISP (Roadrunner), as I have
monitored the line when this happens and it's fine.  My hardware is
far more than is needed to run EQ.

Any ideas?

ALso have a problem when the game crashes and when I log in get a
corrupt eqmain.dll message.  It's becoming a real pain to delete that,
the eqgame.exe, and eqclient.ini file all the time and lost my
settings.  Any have that problem as well and know a way to fix it
other than the Verant fix of deleting the files every time (which
isn't a fix at all really) ?
