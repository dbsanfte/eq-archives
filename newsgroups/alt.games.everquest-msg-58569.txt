Just as a strange note to add to that, yesterday I was working on JC with my
lvl 8 enchanter.  I tried to sell some +2 wisdom rings.  The target level group
should be about 8 to 15, wouldn't you say?  No.  Try 3 to 5.  What kind of
level 3 character has 20 plat to buy two rings????  I didn't meet a single
person under level 6 who bought anything.  Everybody had "better..."
