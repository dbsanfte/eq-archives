TBoots, actually, which will run a bit over 5Kpp and you never have to
bother with the ugliness of the AC or spring for SOW potions, which
believe me even if you are stingy you will eat more than 5Kpp before
getting up to Run 3.  Compare to FT items running 50Kpp each (and
think about how many it would take to get to the kind of mana flow
you are talking about, unaided)

I thought that was the point of Rune, you get hit for zero points while
your pet aggroes in and pulls mob off you... but I'm no chanter, nor
do I group with them while they solo... otherwise it wouldn't be soloing!

Very handy, my druid does that Lesser Succor ride to Shar Val sometimes
just cause its so much fun... but its a whole bar of mana to do it.
