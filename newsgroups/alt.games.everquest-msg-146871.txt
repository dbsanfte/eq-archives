It's not that odd...in fact, that is how they did it when they got rid of
the class XP penalties.  For some reason, they seem VERY reluctant to make
any changes that require doing an offline update to the player database.  If
they changed the actual XP requirements, they would have to go through and
change everyone's stored XP in the player database, because they also seem
to want, on any XP change, for everyone to stay exactly where they were, in
terms of level and bubbles.
