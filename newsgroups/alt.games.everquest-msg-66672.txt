We lack sufficient information to tell you which is better for *you*.

For example, see recent posts by Dan Harmon.  He quit DAoC recently,
citing problems with it and advantages for EQ.  The funny thing is,
the problems he had with DAoC are exactly the things I find wrong with
EQ!  Unless one (or both!) of us is lying, this illustrates how
subjective these things are.
