Fwiw, I have a lower end system (P3 733 w/128mb, cable modem at 64kb,
SBLive!) with the same video card (but only 16mb) and I don't experience the
same problem as you. I would suggest that it is either directx or the video
drivers that are the problem. I do have problems though that are possibly
related to the lower specs but I will live with them until I can afford to
upgrade.

If you are not interested in my problem, don't read any further.

My problem only occurs on FV server (i.e. only one character, a druid, my
other characters on other servers never experience the problem, I have
casters and meleers but no druid, and I have tested them often to be sure)
and the symptoms are a complete system freeze (have to hard boot) during
zoning/gating/porting. It started after installing Luclin, was usually
zoning between FV and LoIo but it didn't happen every time, it occasionally
occurred zoning/gating/porting between other zones but wasn't necessarily
repeated and they were the only instances of freezing (I also have barely
any lag problems except for one other character on Tunare but only when she
is in DL and, then, it can be extremely bad but only when she is in a group
and in combat). I had sound off all this time and switched it on to see what
sort of effect it had and it didn't seem to make any difference. Then,
following another patch, I found that  the freezing then occasionally
happened when sitting relatively idle in a zone. Then I also had ddhelp
abending trying to get in, so I switched off sound and that seemed to
resolve the ddhelp problem. Then, following another patch, it went for a
couple of weeks with no problem at all (despite doing all the same things as
that character had been doing, as she was mainly working the FV/LoIo/FM
areas all this time, porting off to other places occasionally). Now, since
the latest patch, the freezing has come back again and not only that but it
now always freezes at camp, it appears to freeze more often than before
between FV and LoIO and it has frozen (relatively) more often while doing
nothing (i.e. twice in one day). I'm not suggesting that it has anything to
do with the patches, it may just be coincidence. I know I have low specs but
why does it only occur with one character (one server) and why is it usually
when zoning into LoIO from FV (and, it isn't because I do that particular
zoning more than any other, I go between FM and LoIo more often and it
happens rarely then, although it does happen). She has been up to Luclin and
zoned many times and it has only occurred once there (that is the only time
with that character that I experience lag btw).

My only concern with it being related to my lower specs, which is what I am
invariably told, with no definitive explanation, by others when they hear my
story, is that I don't have these problems with my other characters and,
apart form the one instance of lag that I mentioned above, as long as I stay
off Luclin I really have no lag problems. Apart from upgrading the system,
the answer may be to go and fight somewhere else for a while and,
considering she is a 32 druid, that is probably what she should be doing
anyway, if only for different scenery.
