You shouldnt have to start anew - at least not if you have the software -
reactivate the account and your characters should still be there...I know
people who have reactivated aftr extended periods and still got the
characters....

As to is it worth it - well if you enjoyed it last time you should still
do so now. A number of things may have come down significantly in price,
but there are a bunch of new items and the new areas.

Well amongst my friends they have tried EQ, Anarchy Online, Meridian 59,
Ultima Online, Dark Ages of Camelot.....and in non fantasy Earth and
Beyond. Thats games where theytried and stayed byond the free trial
period.

Of that group of games only EQ and Ultima have held players from my group
of friends attention to a significant degree. AO every one of my friends
who tried quit after about 6 months and came back to EQ not did  DAoC
really hold a great deal of of them to play (strangely it was not the game
itself that did that - they both scored well on the technical bits and the
content - but the lack of community that got them).
