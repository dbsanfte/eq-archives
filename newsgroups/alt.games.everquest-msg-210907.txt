Jumping into tier2 before you (or anyone in your group, really) are ready 
will actually slow down your XP.  Sure, the per-mob XP is great, but how 
long is it between kills?  Usually the kill rate will drop through the 
floor.  Likewise if you're being carried by a bunch of lvl 65's into a zone 
where you have no real business being, your cut of the XP is going to be a 
bit lower than with a 'normal' group in tier 1.

Consider going to the hedge in PoN and slaughter tons of lvl 53 and 54 
mobs, which will get you the nice high con bonus and you'll be able to chew 
through 'em very rapidly, usually without needing med breaks at all.

I see a lot of people saying to go to the courtyards in PoD, but I probably 
wouldn't.  Again, the per-mob XP is fantastic there, but the spawn rate 
blows.  Even mediocre groups I had there could keep the place cleared out.  
Better to go do spiders or something where there is no limiting factor in 
your kill rate.

To conclude, I'm reminded of the lvl 57 beastlord guildie who we took to 
PoV with us once.  The XP there was such that he decided he "didn't do tier 
1 any more."  So the next night, he took a lvl 58 shaman, lvl 57 warrior, 
himself and a few others (the only 60+ being a ranger friend of mine who I 
warned ahead of time to have a gate potion).  They didn't even make it 
through one mob in PoV.  It's not hard to see that their XP rate sucked for 
the next 45 minutes while they CR'd (or rather, while they waited for their 
bodies to pop in the GY, rezzed, medded and went to find a camp in tier 1).
