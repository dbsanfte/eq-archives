I have no stake in this at all, apart from interest generated when people
start invoking the word "honour". When they get to the stage of arguing;

 ".....but have you no honour?", their argument has reached rock bottom.

I neither buy nor sell characters and don't much care if anyone else does or
doesn't.

I can't say I blame him, when confronted with this;

"This new agreement supersedes its predecessor, but not agreeing

I seem to remember, a short while ago, Dark Tyger arguing with Adam Kusnierz
that a new contract was formed each time you clicked on the EULA "I agree"
button. Now the consensus seems to be that its only a reminder.

I wonder why no-one seemed to disagree then.
