Not in EQ, there would be too much crying.  Those are role-playing-type
changes and EQ is not a RP game - it's a hack-and-slash.  Now, if NwN used
aging the way it is outlined in the rules ( assuming it's in the 3rd edition
rules ), it would be nice, since will give you the framework to make a good
RPG.

Scars would be nice in NwN, too, but they would be hard to see, I think.
Tatoos would be better as far as visibility goes.  If NwN becomes the big
hit they want it to, maybe they will take suggestions like these.
