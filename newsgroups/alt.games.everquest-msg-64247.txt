  What good is an estimate from an organization that is CONSISTENTLY wrong
on their estimates, sometimes radically so?  What is preventing from Verant
from giving us ACCURATE estimations?  Why do they insist on consistently
setting up their customers for disappointment by seemingly providing no
wiggle room for complications and mistakes?  Sorry, it's just BAD CUSTOMER
SERVICE.  It's an area where Verant has a LOT OF ROOM for improvement.

  Disagree if you like, but what the hell is the need for personal insults
all the sudden, Tyger?  I will admit the bit about being "lied to" in my
post was a bit harsh and perhaps unfair, but you don't have to act like I
just called your mother a crack whore.  Let's keep it civil, please?  I know
not to expect it from the newsgroup in general, but usually it can be
counted on from at least certain individuals.
