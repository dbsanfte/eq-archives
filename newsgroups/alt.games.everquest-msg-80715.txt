Have my laptop on wireless segment, connects via a Netgear ME-102
bridge to my Baystack 10/100 switch, which then connects to the mighty
DLink DL-704 gateway/firewall thingy.

No issues.  Often play from one or two stories away from the WAP in
fact.  

Word to the wise - be aware of where your cordless phones are with
respect to your 802.11b devices.  The 2.4ghz phones *can* disrupt your
wireless network - and vice versa.  I finally had to relocate a phone
base and change my wireless 'channel' to get everything stable.
