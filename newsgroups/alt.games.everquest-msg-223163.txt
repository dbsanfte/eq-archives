If this is what I think it is (just something to send off a minidump of the
crash
so they can analyse where is crashed) then you've *already* crashed at the
point
where the box comes up. So after the box has gone I'd expect exactly this.
It's not something to help you - its something to help the developers figure
out
what went wrong and made it crash on your machine.
