For christ's sake give it up. They DID support it until SoL. If you will
read MS's site once in a while you would see where MS said that they
wouldn't be supporting W95 after a set date. And DX 8.1 not working with W95
is one of the nonsupport things that happens. Next I suppose people are
gonna start bitching that windows 3.1 is no longer supported too, or MSDOS
for that matter.
