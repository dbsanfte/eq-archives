LOL

I'm being called a troll, as a steady reader and sometimes poster in the
group I am now being labelled as a troll by Jekke. That is hilarious

Also ignoring the rest of posting is a good thing, makes it easier to make
you own point, however wrong it was.
Just cut and paste the words as you please.

Thanks for the honor.  :)
