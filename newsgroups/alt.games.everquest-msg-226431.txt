Sorry, disagree.   Two products are getting sold here, at the same time, the
EQ2 beta, and the "Lords of Everquest" RTS game.   Designating one of them
as "coming free with purchase of" the other is pure marketing semantics.  In
reality, it's just a purchase transaction for both products at a combined
price.  Each could easily be sold stand alone.

It is not "bonus material" as you cannot play or enjoy the EQ2 beta at all
without it.  EQ 1 is completely irrelevant to the discussion.
