True but the "percentage" chance to proc will be lower on the 19del weapon
than it would be on the 38del one. The idea being that a slower weapon
should still proc as many times as the faster one. In my experience, slow
2hders (Felhammer, Doljonijiarnimorinar, 46 and 44 del) proc More than fast
one handers (bloodpoint, 21del) over the course of a fight.  Not that any of
that should effect your decision of prim or secondary, procs are too random
to rely on.
