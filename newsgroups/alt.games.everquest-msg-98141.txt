There use to be a time that EQVault gave population counts of the 
servers.  If your server had just about 10 people on it then you could 
reasonably conclude they were all testers and then general public was 
still not allowed to log in till they were done testing.  Now that all 
we are given is an "UP" or "DOWN" message it seems that the EQLive page 
always says "UP" even when it is really "DOWN" (well, its up because 
testers are on it but you can't log on)

Be nice to have it say DOWN when the login server is down.
