You might want to think of moving to a one handed weapon, or keeping
your skills up in several categories.  The reason is there are a number
of off hand items that increase stats.  Don't write off piercing either,
I think I've seen necros running around with daggers that had good
pluses to int.  Unfortunately I don't know specifics.
