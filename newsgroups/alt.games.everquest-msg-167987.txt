Ok, I must be approaching the range of too dumb to breathe...  Another
question.

Went to eqinterface and found a nice player info window I'd like to
use.

Went to my EQ\skins directory and created a new directory called
myskin.  Extracted the two files from the download
(EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml and wnd_gplayer.tga) to that directory.

Started EQ and typed: /loadskin myskin true

pause...

Nothing.  Looks just like what I had before.  Checked the site I dl'd
the files from, didn't see anything obvious I've missed.  If there's a
FM for me to RT, not sure where to look.

Do I first copy everything from the Default folder to "myskin" folder
and copy these two in/over instead of what I did?
