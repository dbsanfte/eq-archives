Tailoring, Smithing or Pottery.  Fletching at this point a somewhat
distant fourth.  Brewing and Baking you can make a little plat with and
require a much smaller investment than the other 4.  The jewelcraft
market is pretty much dead serverwide. 

> Items?

At the highest end, they all make nice items.  Halflings can make some
very nice weight reduction bags with their cultural tailoring.  Not sure
what kind of smithing they get.  They have no cultural fletching
(becoming less and less of an issue with PoP bows).  There's no such
thing as cultural pottery, brewing, baking or jewelcraft. 

> Sense of achievent?

Tailoring is probably the most difficult, followed by smithing, then
pottery, then fletching.  Baking fifth, brewing sixth, jewelcraft
seventh. 

> Difficulty in material collection?

From most to least (IMO):
Tailoring, Smithing (Humans have it easy here, shadowscream sucks),
Fletching (unless you're a wood elf), Pottery (a decent ammount of 
farming involved), Baking (helps if you can forage), Brewing (all store 
bought to 248),
Jewelcraft (all store bought to 250).

Most people do tradeskills because they have too much plat on their
hands and are too cheap/impatient to find someone else to do their
combines for them.  There's not a whole lot of money to be had in them
except for the top 3 I mentioned above, and even then it's hit and miss.
