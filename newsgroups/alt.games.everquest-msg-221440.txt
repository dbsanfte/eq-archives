So, then, "callous fuckwit" notwithstanding (nevermind that, I just 
chuckled when it popped into my head) and just so we're on the same page 
here, you agree that warriors need to be enough better at tanking (plus 
or minus some of the interesting suggestions on abilities) to make up for 
the knights' additional utility. That way xp groups could go with either 
quite successfully, while encounters of end-game magnitude would require 
the tanking specialization of the warrior for success. Do I have that 
right? 

That's what I would consider balanced, anyway.
