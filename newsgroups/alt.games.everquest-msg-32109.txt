That is the point.  We all have our jobs in the group.  I watch health, my
mana level and buffs and try to watch for adds when I am not medding (as I
am usually standing away from the melee).  Everyone has something they get
intent on so they need others to track things also.  When medding, all you
get is the "you feel..." message, and if you miss it, when you stand, the
buff is gone.  I watch for the blinking out of the corner of my eye and also
take a quick count of shields that are up on the screen.  After that, I may
miss something.
