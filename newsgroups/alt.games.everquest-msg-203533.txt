1) You didn't mention what brand of motherboard you're using, nor 
whether or not any of the hardware is new to the system.

2) Was the system working before you installed XP, or is this a 
completely new system?

3) If it was a previously working before you installed XP, did you 
"upgrade" from a previous (old) version of Windows, or was it a 
virgin format/install?

If you're dealing with new hardware:

A) Make double-damn sure the heatsink is installed *correctly* on the 
CPU.  Heat buildup will cause problems.

B) AMD CPU's require 300W (or better) name-brand PSU's. Get an 
Enermax if you're convinced it's the power supply.

C) Make sure that there aren't ANY cards in the PCI slot immediately 
adjacent to the video card.  XP uses ACPI, and that can aggravate IRQ 
sharing issues.

D) Remove everything except the drives, the, video card, and ONE 
stick of RAM. Reformat your hard drive, and re-install XP.  Then, add 
the memory back one stick at a time.  If the system still appears to 
work, re-insert the sound card, and then then ethernet card.

If you're NOT dealing with all new hardware, it might simply be that 
XP doesn't like something in your system (and probably only when it's 
installed in your system).  If you followed the step "D" stuff and it 
still doesn't work, you should be able to easily identify the 
offending hardware.
