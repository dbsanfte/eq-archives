What about those of us who like both?  I enjoy collecting goods
off NPC vendors and hawking them in the bazaar in my "down time".
(Though my wife would rather I free up the computer for CoH. :-)
I'll even spend time active in the bazaar checking for bargains
either for myself, or for resale, which means yes, I watch the
fluctuating prices and try to predict whether the low price I'm
seeing is the new commodity price or whether I'll be able to turn
a modest profit by buying/reselling it.  But I don't want to spend
all my game time on that!

While I agree that I don't want to spend all my time fishing, I'm
willing to do some of it (since the fish still count as pp for
tribute purposes) to support the rest of my playing time, just as
I'm willing to do some trading to raise cash for gear or for
tradeskill supplies (though I mostly farm my own of the latter).
But when I'm out hunting mobs for xp, I do appreciate getting some
loot as well.  And if the loot is mostly stuff I can't use (either
because it's crap, or because I'm the wrong class, or both), then
I do like the fact that I can at least turn it into money.  Contrary
to a remark either you or Lance made, it *does* bug me when I leave
stuff to rot.
