Here's an anecdotal story..take it for what it's worth.  Slow-capable
classes have found that if the slow they cast is below a certain
percentage (what that percentage is depends on the mob) they will not get
the mitigation message.  

This suggests that mitigation simply reduces the slow % to a hard number,
not by a percentage. So, let's say the mob mitigated to 40%...doesn't
matter if you use 50% or 75%, they'll have the same power.

I dont' believe SOE has stated anything absolute, and perhaps there have
been parses on this subject, but the fact that lower slows don't get
mitigated at all on some mobs suggests to me at least that it is an
across-the-board reduction.  If that makes sense.
