Well that's kind of strange because I just tried it out myself the
other day.  In fact I tried it before I went and made that post. 
First experiment:  Get up some height and run out with levitate on and
bind in mid-air.  Then go away and cast gate.  I appeared at the floor
with no falling.
Second experiment:  Bind on lift in Kelethin.  Go away and gate back. 
I again appeared at the bottom with no falling.  Are you sure that
guildie actually performed the experiment?  Sometimes people like to
say things they heard but relate it as first hand information.
