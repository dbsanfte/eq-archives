So, I made a warrior for the max hp possible for raiding use. and once he
gets his disciplines and stuff all will be fine.

However, at level 40. its a wee bit of the challenge to keep agro on more
than one mob at a time.

I was giving thought to the copper hammer of striking, I was always told as
a beastlord not to go anywhere near one of these cuz of agro. so would this
be ideal for my warrior?

Also looking for other possible weapons as well..  any droppable weapon of
any price, or any nodrop that can easily be quested/farmed solo by a 65
beastlord.
Also at 45 I was thinking I would go to natimbi and do that mace quest. it
seems rather decent for such a low level recommended.




This, as anything.. is an experiment. yes I could have made a paladin. but I
wanted a warrior.
