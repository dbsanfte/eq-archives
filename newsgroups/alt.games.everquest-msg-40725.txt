Just my 2 cp....

I was at first rather impressed, even intrigued, about many of DAoC's game
concepts, as described on official and fan websites.  I actually got a bit
excited about the possibilities this game held.  I'm looking forward to see
if they can pull DAoC off.

However, just learning what has been left untested so far compared to the
target release date left me wondering.  From info off DAoC's public boards,
previews, and websites, I couldn't figure out how they'd be able to test so
many major sections of the game still absent, and still make it anywhere
close to their target release date without a tremendous mess on their hands.

I fear they are relying a bit too much on their previous experiences with a
similar MUD that they run, and assuming/hoping that it will mirror over into
a video version smoothly.

Like I said in an earlier post.... it's probably best to wait this one out
to see how well it survives the release before buying it (common wisdom with
all new releases).
