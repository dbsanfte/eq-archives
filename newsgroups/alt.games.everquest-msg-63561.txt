  Really cutting it close, though.  My system is virtually identical to his,
except I've got a different sound card and am running under Windows 95 and
have a VooDoo3 3000 instead of a 2000.  I get poor frame rates in some old
world zones sometimes with the clipping plane set to minimum, particle
effects on low, 640x480, level of detail on, MIP mapping off... putting
about as little demand on my system as possible.

  I'm not even going to touch Luclin until I am running on a system with an
Athlon and at least a GeForce graphics card.  I can feel the bad frame rates
even LOOKING at Luclin screenshots. :)  Though supposedly there would be no
decrease in performance if I didn't bother to visit Luclin and left the
character models off... but then I wouldn't be enjoying any of the expansion
content anyway, except for the ability to create a beastlord.  I'm sure I'd
be able to VIEW the new character models, but I doubt I'd be able to stomach
the poor performance if I tried playing with them.  I am curious about what
my character looks like using the new models, but I'll just ask someone with
Luclin to take a couple screenshots of me.
