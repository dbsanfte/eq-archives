I kinda got lucky. As a result of Saryrn's merging with Mith Marr, I wound 
up with two characters with x's. I subsequently moved them to Stromm, where 
those two names were unused, but another of my characters' name was taken. 
Within a day, I had the x's removed from the first two and the name in 
conflict changed from Xevonx to Zevon.

I guess my point is just to mention that they are quite accommodating where 
name changes are concerned that are the result of a server merge or 
resulting move. I guess it's possible that if I had requested the name be 
changed to something completely different, they may have balked, but I 
didn't get that impression.
