Actually he's refering to the new "skill limited" combines that were
introduced with PoP.  Some people,especially those with large funds,
"forced" success with high trivial item by doing it over and over and
over.  Now, with PoP, if the quest giver says you better be master he
means it, not only in regards to failure but even in regards to be
able to attempt it.  This lead to the increased importance of +skill
items, since they are taken into account when trying to determine your
"skill limit". E. g. a 210 brewer will get a "to low a skill" message
for the etheral temper, but the same brewer with  +5% item will be
able to do the combine.
