I did it solo at 48 (I think -- maybe 49), and while it was
definitely a challenge, it was a lot of fun to figure out how to
do it all by myself.  Basically, clear the tentacle terrors,
even if it takes you a few tries and runs to zone.  Once
they're gone, cast Invis to Undead and tiptoe into the
pit around the Festering Hags, who won't be able to see you.
If you've never been in the pit before, it helps to know
the way out so you're not stumbling around until your
ItU wears off -- climb the ladder, then turn right a little
bit and jump up onto the platform that will be about chest-high
at that point -- the one to your left only goes to a dead-end.
Then either run through the ghost room and out, or hop over
the small gap in the catwalk and go out the way you came in.

You should also be able to get the Meldrath bone solo at 48/49,
but *don't* try to kill him -- you'll likely fail.  Just buff
up, especially with all the Magic Resistance you can manage,
buy a SoW or click your Jboots if you have them, then run
into his lair, grab the bone, and run like hell.

The only one that would be hard to solo, period, is the
one in Phinny's lair in Kedge Keep.  If Phinny is up,
you have *no* chance.  If he's not, however, many Paladins
have soloed the retrieval with Invis potions and a lot
of guts, but it's nowhere near a sure thing and many have
died trying.
