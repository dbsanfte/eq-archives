It's an entirely reasonable rule.  Many guilds have it.  Personally, I 
think you should have more rules than just that one, though.  I would 
include, for exampe, a 'don't be a dumbass and deliberately violate the 
PnP'-type rule.  You'd be amazed how many people will expect their guild 
to back them when they're being obvious dumbasses and ninjalooting, 
training, and KSing.  If you have that rule, you can point at it, and say 
'we told you not to' as you deguild them.  Otherwise, you have to put them 
on /ignore as you deguild them, or listen to them whine about how they 
didn't break any official guild rules.  

My first guild only had three rules.  1. No Begging, 2. No Whining, 3. 
Don't be a jerk.  We got pretty far with that, but I did have to deguild 
one person for violating rule 3, and another deguilded themselves when 
their violation of rule 3 was brought up.  On the whole, I was pretty glad 
we had rule 3. :)

My bazaar trader is /anon, generally.  That may be against the rules of my 
guild, I really can't remember.  But nobody's given me grief over it.  I 
do that because the only thing anyone could -possibly- want my guild info 
for when I'm a bazaar trader is to bitch at my guild over the prices I 
set.  And my guild really doesn't need that, do they?  But then, I do want 
my trader to log guildchat for me, so I can glance at the screen for OTMs 
when I get home.

Of course, I've never had anything particularly valuable or controversial 
to sell, either. :)
