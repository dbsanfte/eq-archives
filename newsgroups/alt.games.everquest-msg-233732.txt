I can't think of anything that you absolutely *have* to have
in Sanctus Seru but I don't know everything there is to know
about the game. What I *would* suggest is that before you do
much more in Katta, to at least go look at Sanctus Seru if
you can. It's a beautiful city.

Now, Katta has been quite useful to me lately. Killing mobs
in TM for the runes/gems/acrylia they drop gives me some
nice pocket change and the Rallic packs are very sellable.
The Rallic packs are also very difficult if not impossible
to get if you're KOS in KC.
