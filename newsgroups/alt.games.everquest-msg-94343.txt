First of all, you're not stuck at all.  You just need to do a bit more
research.  Take your lvl 16 ranger over to Lake of Ill Omen.  You shouldn't
have much of a problem finding a group near the windmill.  From there, as
you level up, you can find groups in other parts of Omen, such as the fort.
Once you hit 25 or so, you can move over to Frontier Mountains(personally I
like Splitpaw dungeon in South Karana), until you hit 30 or so.  From there,
it's on to The Overthere(OT).  OT until 40, then hit DL.  These are just the
most popular place, there are many more places you can go and fight,
although groups will be harder to find.
