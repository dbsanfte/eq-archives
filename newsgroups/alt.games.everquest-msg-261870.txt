In a recent patch, a command was added to allow you to do this 
automatically, without all the button mashing.

/corpsedrag

drags your target until either you die, you zone, or it gets looted and 
vanishes or you type

/corpsedrop

both also work from inside macros.

So update your hotkey to

/corpsedrag
/say just taking out the dead bodies

You'll rarely need corpsedrop if you're just dragging the occaisional 
dead, but if you are a designated dragger for raids, you might want to 
hotkey the drop command too.

Oh, you can also drag two bodies with this, because you can target a 
second and issue the command again.  I don't think it lets you drag more 
than two at a time, although I haven't tested this myself.

Grage, 58 Berzerker, dead at least once per level and at least once in 
75% of raids thus far, Luclin
