Let me circle around a little bit and then answer your specific
question....If I had a regular 5-person group levelling up together like
that, we'd be in LDON adventures all the time and be having a blast. (We'd
always pick up a 6th member and our first choice for that slot would always
be a cleric, but a druid would be an acceptable second choice given that you
have a shaman who can heal cause you have a chanter to haste/slow). LDON is
absolutely perfect for such a group of regular players -- knowing each other
well ingame is a major leg up, you all would tear through the adventures and
enjoy steady exp and good loot even before you start racking up a lot of
points.

[Say if you happen to be on the Saryrn server, send Haabbes the beastlord a
tell and my son or I will log our 27 druid and help you guys kick some
butt].

For LDON purposes the above group is better off with a pally than a warrior.
Paladins are better tanks than warriors for LDON, because they get pacify (I
don't recall at what level they get that spell). That is so very useful in
LDON adventures, I can't begin to tell you....also true in non-LDON
dungeon-type contexts, such as Dalnir or Unrest or whatever.

A well-equipped warrior is the One True Tank for high-end raid purposes,
accept no substitutes in that situation. But it doesn't sound like that is a
priority for you and your group, certainly no time soon. So if I were you
I'd stick with the pally.
