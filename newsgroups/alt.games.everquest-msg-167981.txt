In reality, thanks to those running the program showeq, No matter what
Sony said it was found out they modified the amount of xp you received
from a mob based on level from 51-60, The xp point requirement for
each level were left as they were that's why no one had a "patch ding"
and your xp bar was right where it was pre patch. This has been
covered before but its done some interesting things to AA points and
death penalties. For instance to smooth out level 54 you receive more
xp per mob killed due to a level modifier. Now the question was did
this carry over to AA and it seems it does. A mob killed at 53 or 55
grants fewer AA points than one killed at 54. So if you are building
AAs then 51, 54, and 59 become the preferred levels. Course you get
such a boost from 60 that no one wants to AA at 59. This was seen
following the xp nerf patch a few months ago but it was a small issue
at the time. Now what this does to the death penalty is to increase
its effect on the level following one of the old hell levels, you will
still get the same old hit but each mob killed will grant less xp due
to the level modifier, so rezes are much more important now. Cant say
for sure what the rez exploit was without the hard date from showeq
and I've never seen it. Now what they have tweaked since I cant say
since showeq been a bit nerfed lately.

In short they picked perhaps the worst way to fix the problem they
could find from a player view point and blew tons of smoke to cover
it. Just remember the xp point costs of each level are the same they
always were, there has been no change to those, and go from there.
