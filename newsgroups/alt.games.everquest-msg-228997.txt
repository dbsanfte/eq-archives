I'd have done it for 1KP, in advance.  I'm guessing he would have been /ooc'ing
the whole zone about this *awful cleric demanding 1 KP for a rez* in no time.
As broke as my cleric is, she simply doesn't have *time* for unworthy people at
any price.
It's the principal of the matter.  I wouldn't *work* for a loser in real life,
I won't work for one *in game* either.
Note:  If, in the original circumstance, the guy /ooc'd "looking for help,
PST", I'd have done it for "nothing".  But the guy *offered* 50 plat for the
service.  I, therefore, expected 50 plat.  To have him chince out *after* the
job was completed to satisfaction was just plain weasily.  
FWIW, I have never charged for a rez to date, (not that I wouldn't, it's just
not come up.  I either have time or I don', or, as in this case, I choose not
to).
