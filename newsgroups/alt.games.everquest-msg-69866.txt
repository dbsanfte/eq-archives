Well, I always clean up my mess, even when I'm killing wisps and get one
after another of nothing but burned out lightstones. I simply destroy them
to get rid of the corpse.

Actually Gix is yellow to me. Was wondering myself last night if I stood a
chance of taking him, maybe by kiting, but he probably has some nasty spells
I won't be able to outrun. Guess getting revenge on either of them will
wait.
