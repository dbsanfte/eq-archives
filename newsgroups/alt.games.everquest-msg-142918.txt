I have been only playing for a year, but in my experiences it has gotten
better.  When I started, I had to deal with:

1. Having to take bags out of the bank to be able to move items around.
2. Collecting non stackable pelts to do tailoring, what a inventory hog.
3. Only opening 2 bags at a time.
4. Hell levels.  3 hours and only a blue =)
5. Having to go through Kael, WL, SS, CC to get my teeth for porting.
(Although I thought that was a great adventure, once was enough.)
6. No pet menu, dark Health Report text.

I am sure there are some things Verant nerfed during my year of play, but it
hasn't affected me so I dont care.  And with the new interface/bazaar, that
is a huge plus.  Also with the addition of utilities such as Spawn timers
and Maps, things will only get better.
