This is a classic tactic to flush out the suckers in an attempt to sell an
item for more than it's worth.  Folks continue to do it because it works.  I
do it because now and then I get a sucker.  Caveat Emptor.

When I'm buying and the seller confronts me with "offer", I play dumb:
"gosh, I don't know what it's worth...could you give me a price range?"
They usually reply, and armed with that information I know their low end and
can bargain from there.

Sometimes, I honestly *don't know the value the item I am selling*.  This
happens a lot (a lot is 2 words all you numnutz) with spells I may loot
since I can't see the level of the spell (unless it's my class, duh).  In
that case, asking the buyer to make an offer is reasonable in my book.

Finally <G>....

/auc selling l33t item for much more than it's worth, send tell.

Umm...how else would I contact you....start a fire and send up smoke
signals?
