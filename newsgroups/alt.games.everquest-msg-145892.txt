I have a friend that put together an alt with me, we went with
bard/monk and have been having a great time.

I think you could dual box this duo fairly well, as with any
melee character, the monk mostly just hits attack button
and mashes her special attacks from time to time.  Bard
is busy busy busy, of course, hasting duo, slowing mob,
and running any of a long list of third songs, as well as
meleeing himself.  Very handy for any dual box setup is
snare capability, to stop runners not only from getting help,
but just from moving and requiring you to move two characters
to keep up.
