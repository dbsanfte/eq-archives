I know guides were forbidden to zone into those zones, so that part is likely
true.  And SoE has made a habit in the past of shipping with the final reward
zone unfinished, and using the time it takes people to get there to complete
it.  So I can buy that as well.

But where the writer then goes on to claim SoE intentionally introduced bugs,
and made certain encounters unwinnable, to slow down guilds from reaching that
zone... thats pure tinfoil hat stuff.

Oh please.  Like SoE would waste even a low level drone trying to PR the 10
people who still read Usenet.    Doubtless our massive traffic of *ten* posts
a day was more than enough to pull them off the official message boards to
come here in disguise.  (Here's your hat.)

He's just a slightly obsessed fan.   There are a lot of them out there.
People who absolutely must leap to the defense of any game they like, and
crusade to bring everyone into the light of thier perfect game.    They're
also the ones that come back 1 year later, after they've quit, and proceed to
rip said game up one side and down another, while spewing insults at anyone
"stupid enough" to still enjoy that game.

I think it's a maturity thing actually.   I know I was sort of like that as a
teen myself.  (Defending everything about my game, no matter how stupid the
decision was.)  I grew out of it.  Hopefully other fanboys eventually will as
well.
