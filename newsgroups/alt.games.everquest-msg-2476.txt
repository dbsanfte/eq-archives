Trolls are dominating warriors.  I am still soloing mine at level 27.  With
Bind Wounds and their natural regeration, downtime is minimal.  Also, the
fact that they can Bash without equipping a shield means they get can dual
wield or use a two-handed weapon and still add the Bash damage.  The Bash
will also stun 30% to 50% of the time, thus decreasing the amount of damage
you take.  The troll warrior is a thing of beauty.
