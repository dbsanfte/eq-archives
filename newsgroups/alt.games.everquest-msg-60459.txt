*laugh*  Oh dear.

Planes raids sound like the most terrifying, stressful things ever.  I guess
I'm lucky that the two characters I'm playing these aren't high-level enough
for Fear. . .

And who gave her C2?  /em holds up a sign that says "'Chanters Rock!"

Fun is good.  8)  I always like it when guilds get together and do stuff.

Hmmm. . .yeah, I guess. ;)

Then again, right now I am Ms. Serving Two Masters -- I've got two main
characters (meaning that I play them about equally) in two different guilds.
Because I know folks in both.  And I'm not giving either up, dammit.

Sleep?  What's that?

Heh.  Good stuff, that.  I sometimes find myself roleplaying an Erudian
attitude (of the "slightly mad" variety).

I'm not sure. . .but I think I live on Luclin.  There are shops selling
Tiger merchandise EVERYWHERE.  (My boy-droid says that it's because of the
college, but I maintain that the Vah'Shir are around here SOMEWHERE,
dammit).
