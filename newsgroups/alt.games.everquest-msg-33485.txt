I saw it during the first few days of its original release
when I was in high school, before any word-of-mouth had
started.

And other than hearing that it was sci-fi (well, more or less)
and was reputed to have good special effects (at the time,
"2001: A Space Odyssey" was the pinnacle of SFX), I saw
it ABSOLUTELY COLD.  I just bought my ticket without knowing
what to expect, sat down, and was blown away.

I saw another film the same way, a bunch of us just saw
a very cryptic ad in the newspaper, and nothing much else
was playing, so we went with no idea what to expect and
sat down to see a film.  The film was "Alien"...
Whoa.  Try to imagine what it was like seeing the
chest-bursting scene with *NO* idea it was coming.

You know, maybe I should stop reading movie reviews
for a few months and just start going to movies
in blissful ignorance again...
