It's also a bugged piece of shit.  Level 119 monk(including AA) so I have
rapid feign death (faster recycle time), critical mend (virtually a full
heal, so I have more time to get that fd off), damage avoidance, mitigation,
and stam level 3

pre 50 mob starts hitting me, I decide I don't want to fight it, so i tell
the necro to FD. Then i FD.

Hmm mobs still hitting me.. /stand, /fd.. grr still hitting me.. the mob
wasn't a caster (so FD wasn't broken), I didn't fall to the ground once (So
FD didn't fail)

Ten FD's later, I die in the most patheticly slow manner.

Guide_ImaMoron asks basic monkly retarded questions
...
Guide_ImaMoron tells you, "I have to get permission before I can rez you."
Guide_ImaMoron tells you, "Im sorry, but I can't rez you.  Im an idiot that
knows nothing about monks, FD, AA skills, but Im still not rezzing you"

I wouldn't have been so pissed except for the zone where it was, and the
unrezzed death took me far too close to level 59, than Im comfortable with
:/
