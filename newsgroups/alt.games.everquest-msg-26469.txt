You cannot transfer a character to the PvP servers.

I started up a character last night. 

Observations...

someone is already using the name Lokari there. I wasn't able to use
that as my name. I figured that there are plenty of people who'd like
the chance to smack me around, so I was all set to give them a chance.
Oh well.

I started an Iksar. Having never been to Cabilis before, I went
exploring. Stupid one-way maze. Took me an hour to get out, find my
guild master, and get to the newbie zone.

Once I got to the newbie zone, I immediately realized I had stumbled
into a dick waving contest, as countless dorks, all running under-20th
level characters, argued about which classes were the most powerful
from levels 50 to 60. As if. It went on for an hour, while I watched
in a mixture of amusement and disgust, before I finally decided tv was
more entertaining.
