one time i was in a group at sarnak fort in LOIO and the monk pulling
for our group said "my mom is making me go to the store to get
something.....my little brother is gonna sit in for me.....he cant
speak yet but he knows what pull means". now that is quite young if
they cant speak yet. the group decided to move to back door but little
brother didnt understand so he kept on pulling. we saw his corpse
there later on.
