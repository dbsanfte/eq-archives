It's SPELL CHECK. "cock" is a correct spelling.

Oh well, could have been worse. At work about a month ago a supervisor was
going to send in the nightly "shift report" miss-spelling a certain
word....well "Nightly Shit Report" IS correct spelling, and also correct
grammar, so even though the computer wouldn't have caught it, this was going
pretty high up the corporate chain of command, where they don't have a sense
of humor (except for "hahahahaha, watch me fire this guy") so they might not
have seen it as so funny.

Should be "dock to dock".
