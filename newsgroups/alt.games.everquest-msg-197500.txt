And an exception can't be made for this mob?  Seems to me some low level mobs
decay in time X and others in time Y.. but maybe I'd just seeing two blue
mobs, one 54 and one 55.  I know that depending on whether they are empty or
not, low level mobs decay in either roughly 7 minutes or 30 seconds.  So
would it be impossible to change it so -this- level 55+ mob decays in 7
minutes?

It might be impossible, or very hard.  As I said, I'm not a programmer, I
don't know.  But I haven't heard an official explanation stating that this is
the case.

What happens if we make the executioner a level 54 mob and then beef his
resists up to where they are now?  He's not a caster, so our resists versus
him don't matter do they?  What would this change?  I know they've changed
mob levels before on more than one occaision, if they have to do it here to
rid us of the useless and stupid 30 minute delay, why not bite the bullet and
do it?
