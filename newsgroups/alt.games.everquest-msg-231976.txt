I think I ought to resent that!  I've only been playing for a couple
months, and haven't been PLing, so my main is a mere 23 Iksar Monk.
(I've also been spending a lot of time trying to improve my factions
in various places, instead of levelling.)

Now, I'll admit that part of the reason I chose an Iksar Monk was
because I wanted to be able to solo a lot, and that's what I've done.
But I've also done okay in various groups.  Sometimes I get my hotkeys
fumbled (e.g. have the "pulling" set up instead of the "assist" set)
and am thus a bit slow to start whanging on a mob, but I'm working on
it, hoping to get the rhythms well engrained before I get high enough
level to be involved in anything really complicated.

Anyway, I guess my point is that I can see where the choice of race
and/or class does reflect some sort of predisposition on the part of
the player, but please don't throw us all in the same bucket!

Oh, and if your remark was intended as tongue-in-cheek, then sorry,
it didn't come across that way.  (Maybe a smiley would've helped? :-)
