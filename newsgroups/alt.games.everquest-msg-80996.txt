Lots of good advice has been given here, I've only got one
more small thing to add.

If you have started casting a CHeal and suddenly realize that
the target (or someone else you're trying to keep alive
at the same time) will be dead before the CHeal fires,
you can instantly interrupt it (or any other spell) by
"ducking" for moment (press "d" to duck, then "d" again
to resume standing), then fire one of your quicker heals.
