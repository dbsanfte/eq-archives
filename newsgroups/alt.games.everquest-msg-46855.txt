There used to be a terrorist group that operated in Jordan. They would
have continued operating, as well, had they not made the mistake of
calling King Hussein, "The Midget King". These people had their families
and loved ones rounded up. Hussein then issued a statement that he would
begin executing family members if the terrorists did not surrender.

The terrorists thought he was kidding. A few weeks later, the terrorists
had less family members and were turning themselves in. To my knowledge,
every terrorist that turned himself in was executed or imprisoned for
life. That terrorist group was wiped off of the face of the planet.

A little draconian, true. But it worked.
