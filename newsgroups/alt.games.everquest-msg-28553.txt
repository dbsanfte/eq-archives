Well, I was assuming that you'd be getting the 90% exp rez, and be 46 after
the rez. Would I go into a plane with only a blue bubble into 46? No. But I
did with a yellow or so.

This could have happened to me.. due to a mixup, I got left behind in Hate
with only 2 other people when the raid was over, and we died. Neither were a
cleric, and if I had been 45 after my death, I would not have been able to
have been ported up to retrieve my corpse. We would have had to find a
cleric to rez me (at 4AM), instead of just having the necro summon my corpse
for me. So, I can see how it could happen..
