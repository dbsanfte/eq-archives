Actually, I do see her argument. Everquest is a game which thrives on 
it's users addictions. It's obviously sort of like an alternate social 
life to some, and the only social life to others. It is a game which in 
order to advance you must spend countless hours imagining yourself as a 
Tolkien character fighting orcs, spiders and dragons for the sake of 
profit and adventure.  Much like any addiction, what starts as harmless 
fun or experimenting, soon becomes a habit, and then a neccesity. Also 
like most addicting drugs, Everquests primary target is it's users 
pockets, hence the 19.95 a month for an account. Hence, I think that 
she is perfectly right in demanding a warning label on such a game. It 
won't hurt the sales any and would simply warn naive users of the 
implications of what they might be getting into.
