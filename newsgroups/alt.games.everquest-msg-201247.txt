Only problem is that a PH is usually up when you're looking for
hasten. Normal PH is a drake, specials are Brother Quinn (? the one
tht spawns in RM, not SK), a named drake that hits for over 200 (part
of the SK epic, I think) and one more (some named bear?). The named
drake and bear are pretty rare. Seen the drake once briefly while
hunting HGs, didn't even have time to start running before I was dead,
and never seen the other one. 

Easiest spot we found to camp hasten is the 4 way intersection just
after you zone in from Feerrott. They'll path in from the south and
hang a left at the 4 way. 

Rgds, Frank
