I didn't even buy the summon armour spells =p

Still plugging away on my magi, only have time to play him once a week, 2 at
best though.  No pet canni here, he's still just level 63.

Did you ever get your black steel spell?  I got that on a spec turnin, and
it sat waiting in my bank for a month or so till I could mem it :)

Exp would be more forthcoming if i could ever find PoV outer caves open, as
it is I have to settle for the (inferior) HoH exp.  61 air pet does a decent
job tanking, he's managed to stand up against level 66 HoH named a few times
(slowed, of course)
