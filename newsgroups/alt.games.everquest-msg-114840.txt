Nonsequitor time.  Yesterday my wizzy was in Kel bank when someone asked him
for a TL to WC.  I told him that I'll do it for a donation.  He explained he
didn't have any cash on him.  When I told him that a TL to Commons costs me
money he suddenly realized the banker was right next to me.  He only paid 2p
but that covered the cost, so I was satisfied. :)

BTW, he finally hit 49...NO MORE PORTING STRANGERS TO VELIOUS!  YAY!!  Since
I lock up every third time (or so) zoning into GD I'm very happy that I can
PUNT people there instead of going with them.
