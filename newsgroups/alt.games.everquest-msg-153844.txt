Yep, for most purposes monks are currently a far better choice
for puller, just as rangers are far better trackers than bards
or druids.  What I'm raising here is the possibility that SK
are about to eclipse monks in the pulling front.

Why do you need root?  Snare should work for this purpose,
pull the mobs out en masse, then snare the one you want, FD,
watch them wander off back to their spawn spot, with the
"target" dawdling behind.  Stand up and get the snared mob
back on you, lead him to the kill zone.

Pure theory on my part, as a puller I make a good cleric.

Aha.  Thats precisely my point.  Monks NOW are much better
pullers most of the time.  Monks post nerf?

Well the thing is you can claim "realism" or you can claim "game
balance"... either way you look monks were broken. Realistically,
a person in a robe gets hit with a sword or sharp claws and
teeth, he's hurt much worse than someone in head to toe sheet
metal.  Game balance wise, monks pay for their high damage
output by... high damage absorbtion?  This makes no sense.
