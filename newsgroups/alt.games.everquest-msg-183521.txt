I was going to just leave this post alone as self evident proof of
your uselessness but since you decided to declare victory on the basis
of non-responsiveness....


From the shadows, the mysterious "James Hicks"

Incorrect.

Booting someone because you incorrectly think they aren't playing
properly even after being told WHY you are wrong is stupid.

No, just noting your experience, and therefore your conclusions, are
virtually worthless considering your inexperience and inability to
play without KEI.

It's like asking some guy who's highest level is 50 how to fight and
pull in ToV. They might get some of the words right, but they won't
know anything useful.

When you say "I can't play without KEI!" it's all you deserve.

Ah yes, now I see why it takes you months to get levels.

You aren't up to my standards for grouping. Single pulls are not
friends (when you have CC). Single pulls are for people who can't play
better.

Everything you say points decisively to your inexperience.

And I note you dodged the mana argument.

I did that without KEI or even a *group* while charm soloing. This is
what impresses you? You'd fall over dead if you saw what a *good*
enchanter can do.

I can do better without KEI.

Irrelevant. KEI helps obviously. It is not necessary and anyone who
thinks someone showing up without it is doing the group a disservice
is wrong.

Hey, find things you can be proud of where you can, you're not doing
very well on the argument side.

It is sad you can't play without it. All of us who actually leveled
before KEI arrived pity you.

Admitting it is the first step.

Of course they can, and have.

What is at stake is your absurd claim someone coming to the group
without it is doing the group a disservice, not that KEI isn't
helpful.

Unfortunately you seem to think doing their job is casting constantly
without medding, apparently.

No. A tank showing up without them is neglecting his duties as a tank!


Still waiting for you to explain why using augmentation rather than
alacrity is *always* wrong in a melee heavy group NOT addicted to KEI
(the original argument). Until you do, your "I win the argument!"
baloney will be treated with the contempt it deserves.
