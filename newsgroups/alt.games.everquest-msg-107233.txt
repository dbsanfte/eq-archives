You may already know this, but i'll point it out anyway.... You don't
have to alt+number the song you were playing to turn it off, you can
alt+number *any* song to do this. So instead of
    Alt-1, pause 3, Alt-1, Alt-2, pause 3, Alt-2, Alt-3, pause 3, ...
you can do
    Alt-1, pause 3, Alt-2, Alt-2, pause 3, Alt-3, Alt-3, pause 3, ...
Double tapping an alt+number key is much easier (for me at least)
than trying to hit two different alt+number key combos rapidly in succession.

Also, I use two hands for twisting when I can afford it. Left thumb working
alt key, right hand working the numbers. It's much easier on my hands and
more accurate for me as well.

I've tried twisting instruments and songs at the same time, but reached
meltdown point after about 20 seconds :)
