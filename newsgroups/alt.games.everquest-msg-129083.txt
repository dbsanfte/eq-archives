Nope it stays invisable.  Had that bright idea myself and did my aoe
song.  When it attacked me at least it was automatically targeted.  I
could have kited it if a cyclopse had not been in the area I needed to
kite.  So I ran to the bridge shouting "Invisable Giant Inc to
bridge!!!! I am serious".  Well the people in the area could hear the
giant but never saw it and it did not agro onto them either.
One of these days I will go back and kill one of them just to say I
did.
