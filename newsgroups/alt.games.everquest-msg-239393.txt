On Fri, 12 Mar 2004 11:33:16 -0800, I needed a Bable Fish to
understand "Winterfury Thunderwolf" <abuse@fcc.gov> :

Snip various corrections and additions..... (moved some text to
correct area, removed invisibility check, and addes Winterfuyr's
suggestion)

well I appreciate the input, and ya I noticed the mess up on the
corpse hot key and its location previously... in fact I corrected it,
but in all my great organizational skills I copied and pasted the
wrong file.
here is the new and improved one...  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips and Tricks 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance / Raid settings 

/SHOWGRASS OFF reduces lag in newer zones with moving tree branches 

/showspelleffects off will remove the most of the pretty spell
effects. 
To remove the rest, you will need to go into the display options to
remove the new particle effect. 

/shownames off turns all names off so you don't get lag from all the
names. Good for raids. 
/shownames 1 (reduces everyones name to just thier first name) 
/shownames 2 (reduces everyones name to first and last) 
/shownames 3 (Shows title and whole name) 
/shownames 4 (shows guild, title, and wholename) 

/hidecorpses all or /hidecorpses allbutgroup works well to get rid of
dead bodies that you don't need to loot and are interfering with
targetting. 
Targeting your corpse and typing /loot will also loot for you. 

For pet classes: Pet will always have its last target's corpse
targetted if you haven't cleared its targets or given it new attack
order yet. So if a mob dies inside a wall, assist your pet, go next to
the wall and type /loot. 

Ctrl - (minus) to lower clip plane without having to switch to
options. 
Ctrl + (plus) to move clip plane back out. 

If you are on a high-speed connection, find the file datarate.txt in
your EQ Directory and change it so the value is 8. This will cause
larger packets to be downloaded to you (decreasing lag) ( have heard
of values higher than 8 causing frequent LD on zone) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Casting 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ducking Interrupts Casting Immediately� rather than trying to run or
jump, duck will stop it now 

/target will target the closest thing whose name is unique. This works
on mobs too. For example. There are 2 players named Fred and Fredrick
on the raid, both not in the group. Fredrick needs healing. Type '/tar
Fredr' and as long as Fredrick is within 50 feet of you (forwards or
backwards - doesn't matter) she will get selected to be your current
target. If you type '/tar Fred' and both Fred and Fredrick is within
50 of you, your current target will not change since 'Fred' is not a
unique name 

/tgb on - lets you cast group spells on another group without having
to be invited 

/rt will return a tell to the last person that gave you a tell 
It actually returns the target of the person, that send you a tell.
Providing they are within range. 

alt+# 1 - 8 casts the spell in that spot 

Arrow keys left and right flip through the pages of your spellbook if
you have it up 

/book # opens your spellbook to page #. 

Right click on a empty spell gem will bring up your spell list menu. 
Right Click on the "open spell book" image brings up the save spell
set. 

/memspellset index/name (/memspellset buff or /memspellset 1) to mem
your spell set. 

Cure disease will cure Slow 

Cure poison will cure Tash 

If the cleric has divine aura on, or the bard is playing their divine
aura spell, they will not teleport with you nor will they succor.

To get into The Hole, go down to the bottom where the pond is in
Paineel. When you are in the water, in the upper right portion of the
rocks there is a hole you can squeeze through. Wolfform helps in doing
this. Keep trying and eventually you'll make it through. 

/ttell. Targeted tell. Useful for sending a tell to the owner of a
corpse. Works for the living too. Once you remember to use it (you can
use it on corpses) it's amazing. Ever talk to someone with a horribly
complicated name to spell at a glance? Target them and /tt. 

/join <channel name> will have you join channel 
/list will list all the channels you are in 
/list # will list all in that specific channel # 
/# to speak in a channel 
/leave <channel #> will have you leave channel 
/autojoin <channel name> will make you autojoin that channel. 
/autojoin channel is a toggle. To stop autojoin just retype it and it
will leave autojoin. 

/rsay or /rs have you talking in the raid channel (PoP only) 

For characters with pets, pressing the respective group select
function key (F1 - F6) twice will target their pet, provided the pet
is within 50 feet of you. 

Pressing F1-F6 targets respective person in group, F1 being yourself. 
If you press the F1-F6 key again you will target the individuals pet. 
F7 targets the closest player in view 
F8 targets the closest NPC in view 

Pressing 1-10 initiates respective Hotkey 

/doability #number 
abilities 1-6 are standard abilities and 7 � 10 are the combat
abilities. 

/ho <macro name> 
/hotbutton *Name_With_No_Spaces* *First Line Can Have Spaces* 
Thus... 
/hotbutton Help /g HELP ME!!! 
Gives you a hotbutton that when depressed says 
"HELP ME!!!" to your group. 
Slightly pointless addition, but you can have spaces in a hotbutton
label if you use quotes. 
i.e. /hotbutton "Shout Help" /g HELP ME!!! 
creates a hotbutton labelled "Shout Help". The only thing is, if the
label is too long, when it wraps, part of it may drop off the bottom
of the button. 

How to add more than one line of /say or /shout to a hotkey.
Ordinarily if you just put multiple /say commands in a hotkey, only
the first one will get executed. However, a hotkey that looks like
this: 
/pause 3, /auction Look what I've got for sale today: 
/pause 3, /auction This 
/pause 3, /auction That 
/pause 3, /auction and the other Thing! 

works and all 4 lines display. 

When creating the macro's, you can put " /stand " on the first line to
save yourself time having to find your stand hotkey, and on the flip
side you can use /sit (note: /sit can be used as a toggle) 

%r returns the race of a player character. 
%s returns the subjective pronoun (he, she, or it). 
%o returns the objective pronoun (him, her, or it). 
%p returns the possessive pronoun (his, her, or its) 
%m gives back your pets name 

' is a shortcut for /say 
: is a shortcut for /emote 

/assist <target> will target what ever that person is targeting. 

/assist will target what ever that person or MoB is targeting. 

/doability # will perform the numbered ability 
/do # works as well. 

To not auto attack when you type /assist, type either /assist off or
in your EQClient.ini file change AttackOnAssist=TRUE to read FALSE 

If you need to cast after running, tap a short turn before casting to
avoid having an interrupted spell. (This forces the server to update
your location so it doesn't think you're still running) 

You can left-click-and-hold an inventory slot and drag-and-drop it
into an empty hot button. So, her Crucible of Escape is always
available for use without opening her inventory. 

After you hit the "r" to reply to the last person you can also hit the
"tab" key to cycle through all the people that have sent you a tell.
Up to 10 I think. Useful if you are talking to several people at once.

To find a corpse that is missing, make a hotkey with /target <player
name> and run around hitting the hotkey. When you are in range of the
corpse, you will see the name appear in your target window. Then type
/corpse to summon it. 

How to drag multiple corpses: 
Make a hotkey(s) with the following: 
/corpse <name1> 
/pause 2 
/corpse <name2> 
/pause 2 
etc for as many corpses as you need. You will need to move slowly, but
you will be able to summon multiple corpses along as one giant pile. 

Hold shift down and hit pageup or pagedown and you will scroll the
main chat window up or down 1 page at a time. 

Hold shift and up or down arrows will cycle through the messages you
have typed 

Ducking significantly reduces falling damage when running on hilly
terrain 

Dropped swords/daggers point north 
Clouds always move east to west 
Moss only grows on the north side of trees 

To stop moving quickly while on a horse, just click off the horse icon

Sitting causes Agro with mobs. This can work to your advantage if the
mob doesn�t summon. If you need to keep a mob off the tank for a
moment, sit and as it comes towards you, stand back up. This is known
as ping ponging the mob. The mob will go back and forth between you
and the tank. 

� � � on the numberpad is the Default Key for Screen shot 

cntrl click picks up a single item from a stack 
shift click picks up an entire stack of items 
This also works when you are purchasing/selling items. To buy only one
of any stackable type of item, hold the CTRL key and click BUY. To buy
a stack, hold the CTRL key and click BUY. Do the same thing to sell
single units or whole stacks. 

/autoinventory will take whatever's on your cursor and put it in your
inventory. Very useful for tradeskills. 

When looking at a merchant's inventory, hold your cursor over the
inventory and press alt -- you'll be able to see the names of all
items without having to click on each one. 

Shift and up and down arrows will let you scroll through what you have
previously written. Comes in handy when someone has missed your tell
or reply. 

/toggleinspect off Will keep you from inspecting someone everytime you
try to click on them (I found this very annoying in groups). 
/toggleinspect on will turn it back on. 

To put a comment in your profile that others see when they inspect
you, go to a non first person view(F9), target and inspect yourself,
and type in the box. 

Grab a KEi, load up your cheapest, fastest casting spell for the skill
you wish to raise and head to the Plain of Knowledge zone. 
Begin casting whatever spell you have chosen, on yourself. the spell,
be it a de-buff, DD or DoT, will not effect you, but will still raise
the skill. buffs will work as normal. 

One more thing to add: 
You can shorten any command to just the letters required to make it
unique, 
and some commands have explicit shortcuts. 

Examples of shortest unique command: 
/shownames and /shown 
/ttell and /tt 
/target and /tar 

Examples of an explicit shortcut: 
/tell and /t 
/gsay and /g 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terms 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MA: Main Assist, the person that tells everyone else what to kill. 

MT: Main Tank, the person who you try and get a mob to hit 

ST: Secondary Tank: backup for MT if stuff happens. 

SA: Secondary Assist: Backup for MA if MA goes down or MA misses
something. 

OT: Off Tank, person who is tanking a mob that the raid force is not
trying to kill at the moment. 

MA is not the same as MT its just that some people do both jobs at the
same time. The only real difference between MT and MA is that MT
doesn't have to know what mobs are more dangerous or what mobs are
mezzable, but the MA does (otherwise you're not doing your job).
Usually one person can do both jobs at the same time. 

Rampage is an extra round of attacks, that a mob can do, that hits the
first person on the rampage list. 
Mobs that rampage have a hate list and a rampage list. Rampage is not
changeable, you enter at a specific point, and that is where you
remain (well, you can't lessen your position on the list I should
say.. when somebody dies, you go up a place). Some PoP raid mobs can
AE rampage and hit everyone in the mob's melee range at once. 

At the point of agroing a mob, a MA and rampage tank will "agro" it. 
This sets the following 2 lists 
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
MA MA 
SA SA 

Now the raid engages, the agro list will change (e.g. clerics and
debuffers will rise), but the rampage list is unchanged 
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
MA MA 
Cleric1 SA 
Enchanter1 Cleric1 
Shaman1 Enchanter1 

10 minutes on... the lists would look something like 
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
MA MA 
Wizard1 SA 
Rogue1 Cleric1 
Monk1 Enchanter1 

Rampage will never hit the MA either (if the mob is meleeing you, he
can't rampage you) 

Another is Flurry: 4 extra attacks on 1 target (whoever the mob is
currently beating on) 

Common battle tactics, and why? i.e. MT gets in front of mob, no one
hits till they call it... then all melee stays behind the mob. Why?
When is it useful? When is it not useful? 

Because mobs riposte. When a mob melees for several hundred, if you
take a few ripostes you are going to be substantially low on health
and requiring healers to focus on more than just the MT/MA. Also,
because parry, block, riposte etc don't come into play from behind, so
you will do better damage.
