NO. It makes it easier. You have to show how it negatively affects the
game to show it is *too* easy. What happened in the past is done, what
happens now does not affect your enjoyment of things in the past.

That's a pretty big if. I see absolutely nothing to make me think
L1-10 have been trivialized. It's not like they were in the Sebilis
crypt here. The only way L1-10 corpses were hard to find was because
the newbie didn't know the zone it was in. Now they can explore the
zone without the threat of never seeing their stuff again. This is not
a bad thing, its a good thing.

Well then. :-p

The line is completely arbitrary and therefore you can't base an
argument on the earlier changes being bug fixes while these changes
are enhancements. I can just as easily and correctly say they are all
enhancements, or all bug fixes.

Remember, we were all having fun BEFORE the earlier changes too. They
just made life easier. More fun, actually.

The assumption being that players who wouldn't have stayed in the game
otherwise are somehow more annoying than those who would have? There
is no basis for that argument.

So do I, but this was one of the arguments, even though the original
proponent has wisely backed off of it.

No doubt. This all changed when the Vision left the building. Now
there were a lot of good points to the Vision but there were a few
really bad ones too. Since they seem to be correcting the bad ones but
not damaging the good ones, why worry?

There are a lot of people OUTSIDE our little community looking at the
next patch and saying "Wow Verant finally got a clue!". I think that
means a lot.


>This does open the door to fear of what else they may mess with. 

To undeserved fear. People fear all sorts of illogical things. That in
no way means the patch is negative.

Yes, that old slippery slope fallacy. Fears without basis in fact
other than using a logical fallacy are not evidence for the argument
the patch is a bad thing. They are just that - unsubstantiated fears.

That is true but without any actual factual reason to believe it will
go bad, why get into a tizzy over changes that are *good*?

The response some used was "Oh my god bad changes they lead to dumbing
down the game in the future" when the PROPER response should have been
"Oh my god great changes but make sure you don't go too far".
