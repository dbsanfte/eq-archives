Since the patch on Tuesday I have a problem with my character appearance.  I 
have a high elf enchanter who usually has gnome illusion on.  He should have 
gray hair and beard, and he appears that way to all of the other players. 
However, on my screen, he had dark hair and beard.  And I can't seem to 
change it.  Changes to the high elf appearance still give me dark hair and 
beard when i use gnome illusion.  And I can't change the appearance while 
the illusion is on.

Any ideas?
