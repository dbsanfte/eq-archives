Well, if you've ever been on the Verant supported forums on their website,
you'd see cases where people tried to criticise Verant there (some of them
even being civil about it, if you can believe that) and were banned from
game because of it.  Verant's new idea of "customer service" seems to be
"deny all problems, ban those who bring them up".  Makes me wonder if that's
why a bunch of their high-level people left to start their own company...
