    Game first, world second. If I wanted a chat room I'd find one a heck of 
a lot better than a MMORPG.

    First off, you should know from EQ that unless loot is identical that 
people will figure out an "optimal buildout", and your "similar" equipment 
will be considered lesser equipment if not part of that gear set. As for the 
multiple places theory, isn't that the pipe dream of every MMORPG, to add 
much more content than the players could possibly consume? And it never 
happens. Why? Because it takes a great deal of time to design, playtest, and 
implement an encounter, and very little time to solve one. The players will 
always consume what you make for them and end up needing more. The only 
practical way around this is instancing. The trick is to make the instancing 
a useful part of the game and not one that turns the game into a single 
player game, as you've mentioned.

    If the goal of a game isn't tied in to the mechanic that keeps people 
playing, the game will fail. Nurturing your character, growing them in 
power, is the primary hook for a MMORPG. It is all about gear and gaining 
levels/AA's/skill points/whatever you choose to call them.

    What game did you play? LDoN showed that if you present missions with 
different effort vs. reward that players will flock to the one with the best 
e/r. The fiddling done with the missions after release and the poor tuning 
of the raids showed exactly how poorly the whole thing was playtested and 
balanced.

    Again: if they don't have the same stats, they aren't "just as good". 
Players will find which item best fits in the optimal character build and 
drastically discount the value of the others.

    He wants the "optimal" item. Everyone will. If you make the items 
identical, and the encounters identical, why not instance? Pros: quicker to 
deliver content to players, fewer CS complaints from player disputes, easier 
to adjust content after release. Cons: players don't bump into as many other 
players. Seems like a no-brainer to me.

    The first time you do an encounter you don't know if you'll be able to 
overcome it. There's excitement in testing strategies, hell there's even 
excitement in testing spoilers for the first time. That excitement is 
drained if you need to queue up to even get to the encounter. As for the 
idea that the unpredictable behaviour of other people is somehow fun, let me 
emphasize how unfun being trained by retards or KS'ed by some asshole is. 
People don't play PvE games to engage in PvP.

    How do you balance encounters if they can be zerged by armies of people 
"rescuing" others? Balance is important.

    His model, that the player wishes to be the protagonist in the story of 
the world, is the model designers are keenly aware is the dominant model. 
Look at the recent interview with McQuaid and Garriott - they had to answer 
a question on it, and in their responses revealed that it is a design 
consideration.

    Nobody wants to be a small cog in the machine. SWG tried this, with 
people being common professions, and they had to cave in to the massive 
outcry of players that wanted to be jedi. Players want to be the hero, and 
if your game can't help them, they'll move on or never try you in the first 
place. There's plenty of ways to make a character feel heroic without 
destroying interactivity. Instancing is one of those ways.

    If it's not an entertaining world, why play? SimEarth is *that* way.
