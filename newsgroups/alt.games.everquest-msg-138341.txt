As I use the term mana battery, it applies to my necromancer which has
the ability to trade HP's for mana, and transfer that mana to other
casters.
Then I use a HP drain on the MOB to regain some of the lost HP.

Might be some items that are mana batteries too. I dont know.

As far as I know Beastlords can't perform the same trick, thus can't
be mana batteries.
