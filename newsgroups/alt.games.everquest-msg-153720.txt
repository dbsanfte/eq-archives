VI: Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original
intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term
damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful
creatures with zero risk.

Zero risk...
I wonder how many other classes play with zero risk?
Lets see... druids with snare that lasts 11mins while they SoW themselves
and nuke? Isnt this zero risk? Wizards classic Root&Nuke? (i thought that
was kinda the idea of wizards).

Maybe my wizard should start tanking? WTF is Verant on about???????????
Giving every other class new features and nerfing wizards (which is an
already broken class seems like another dagger in the back for wizards).
