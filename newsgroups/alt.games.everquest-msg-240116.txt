Because they didn't get prior permission to post here, from the newsgroup
guardians! DUH

But seriously, I totally agree with you. Who gives a fuck WHAT they post
with, or WHERE they post from?  They don't top post, they don't flame even
half as bad as some of the regulars here.. this is a public place, they
don't need anybodies fucking permission to post messages here. And leaping
onto their back with flames to drive them away is contrary to the spirit of
these places

Do you want to be asked if they can post here, some $$ in the mail so you
leave them alone?

Its a whole bunch of new people and new personalities.. some will be
assholes, of course.. but thats fine. We can just label them alongside "our"
current NG assholes... and even if they never contribute high level l33t
beta inf0z, and just ask a lot of questions, the NG is still a better place
for it.

EQ related messages = good, regardless of what they ask, what server they
come from, or what fucking gateway they use.  I for one welcome the extra
noise here.. I can think of several regulars here who's post rate has
dropped like 95% in the past year, including mine.  If anything is gonna
change that trend (for me at least), new fresh blood in here is a good start
for sure.

Some good advice is scattered in this thread (amongst the many retarded
flames).. use quotes properly.. don't top post.. and just don't even
retaliate to certain flamers in this group.  Not because they are flame gods
or higher ranked people here.. just because they aren't worth the fucking
effort to bother.  You will soon learn these names..

Another good idea (for those that didn't yet post here).. lurk for a while,
learn the names of this places pryomaniacs, and just avoid em.  Makes your
life a whole lot easier here, thats for sure.

P.S Oh yeah, welcome to the newsgroup!
