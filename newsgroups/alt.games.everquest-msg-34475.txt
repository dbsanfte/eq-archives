Nah, you're being tag teamed now RC.  Lokari *and* DT, while occasionally
tossing in helpful bits or URL's about EQ, seem to get the most pleasure out
of poking people with sticks until they yell 'ouch', then bitching at them
that they mispelled 'ouch' or some other such nonesense.  Just amazing as I
release all these KF flags over the weekend and once again, the first few
things I see from these idiots is the usual tag-team the newb gag - only
this time they're doing it to someone who's posts I've enjoyed in other
forums for quite some time.

Bag out now and KF them both bud and this group will get exponentionally
friendlier and informative with that light buttery flavoring.  Just not even
worth spending the breath and  carpal energy to fight a losing battle with
people who live for this crap.  Bah, sad little people.  Oh hey, but Lokari
has a tailoring guide so she's cool and all of that LOL
