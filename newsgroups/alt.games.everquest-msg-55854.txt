I had the joy to got to handle a chanter gobbo in runnyeye last night. Sad
thing was that player monster play by player rules. No climbing over trees,
no hitting thru walls, falling damage, you can drown, _need spell
components_ etcetc..

You might guess mobs rarely have tiny daggers for ench pets, and not really
vendors near :P (not that you could interact with vendors anyway :( )

I tested the new system for 5 hours last night. Not really as fun as i
imagined but this will be great enchantement to gameplay if this ever gets
live (which i doubt because i can imagine ton of exploits in this system).

I have also nice screenshots of creating huge train of firebeetles in qeynos
and training them on a guard. Hehe.. I managed to get the guard to aprox 2/3
health :)
Btw, guard always selected me as target if i went there with 20 of my
firebeetle friends to bite it's ass.

I only got to old world zones only, but i saw atleast one npc /yelling in
Kunark too.

Mobs always have all stats at 75 and have slight magic resist boons.
You can do what ever you want with the mobs inventory.
You can use the mobs skills but you still need shield for bash for example.
Mobs have all spells for their level. You can use all of them but you still
need spell components if they are required.
If you are undead mob, you can still be hit with nonmagic weps.
You cannot hit magic monsters without magic weapons.

Soo.. It seems they put together only bad sides of player characters and
npc's...
