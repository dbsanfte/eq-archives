What they said was "you may only learn advanced abilities in the field" or
something similar to that; subtle difference from what you thought.  What this
means is that you can only learn up to skill 21 via trainer, after that you only
learn by doing.  Find a nice simple recipee, do the combine.  If its not TOO
easy, then you have a chance to gain a skill point every time you try it.
Eventually, you'll gain so much skill that that particular combine will no
longer have any chance of raising your skill, and you will recieve a message to
this effect (containing the word trivial) whenever you try it.  Now you move on
to a harder recipee, and repeat.  Thousands of times.  Until finally your skill
hits 250 (or something like that) and you can never again get a skill increase
on anything.  Now you are a Grand Master Tailor at last.

Should work exactly the same way as the small, likely you are putting wrong
items in the large for some reason, but another possibility would be that the
large sewing kit is bugged or you are bugged.  The game has a few quirks to it
like that from time to time.
