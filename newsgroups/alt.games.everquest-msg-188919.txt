seems like I am becoming quite adept at screwing up my life and getting back
up and trying again a little wiser, I can only assume that eventually I will
figure it out and do something positive someday, although it seems like if
there was anyone who could do absolutely nothing after being given
everything it would be me. Someone who is a complete imbecile. Someone who
should be manacled in the town square and have tomatoes thrown at them all
day. Someone who sits on a wall and falls down over and over while making
funny noises. Someone who is a 43 year old man and is still in kindergarten
and sitting in the corner with a dunce cap on. That is how I feel, I wonder
if anyone else feels that way too or if I am the only one?



Oh  Louis I missed you so much. Especialy in the chat.  I was wondering if
you would come back.  How have you been latley? lots of hugs Sugar21
