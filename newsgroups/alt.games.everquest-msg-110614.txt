Venril Sathir is blue, why can't I solo him?

Last night, I was soloing in Chardok entrance. Another druid zoned in,
went to pull a chokidai whelp, and moments later asked me if I wanted
his chokidai sniffer add. I took the add off his hands, killed the dog
I was working on, found out that the other druid was level 46, told
him he maybe shouldn't be there, but he was sure he'd manage to solo
it even though it had a lot of hps and hit hard - after all, it was
blue, right? A group of people was assembling at the entrance as I
killed the added sniffer. I asked them if they were heading further in
and was told yes, if I got MY dog off them. Level 46 druid had been
splatted, his whelp had aggroed on one of the group, and since I was
now the only druid in the entrance and the whelp was snared, they had
thought it was mine. (To top it off, the level 46 complained that
there was no way to zone out. Know your geography, boys and girls.)
