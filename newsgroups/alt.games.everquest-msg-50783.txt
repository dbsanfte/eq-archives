What is there NOT to be "apathetic" about? It's not like it's the end
of the world if the GBS drops to 50pp in value. There's plenty of
other sources of money that won't decrease without changes in the code
of the game. Those sources are more than enough to pay for the
necessities. (By the time I got my druid from 34 to 39, she had enough
to pay for all her spells with nearly 1kpp left over strictly from
looting everything and selling it to merchants. She'd even GIVEN away
pieces of armor and velium weapons...)
