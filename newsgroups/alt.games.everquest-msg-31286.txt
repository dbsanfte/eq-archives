Clerics that don't use mod/heal for mana when its just lying there on
the ground are failing to utilize one of the best resources in the game..

225hp is 25% of your hp?  You are at mod rod level, in a raid, and don't
have cleric hp buffs up?  (boggles)  Get Resolution (or better) and
Symbol of Naltron (or better) and then tell me what a massive HP
hit the rod looks like.  Hey, that tickles.  Can I have another?

OK, so in many ways the mod rods suck as mana generation for a
mage.  However, they are significantly better than the clerical
means of mana generation.... which is nonexistant.
