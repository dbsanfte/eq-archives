I solo'd Meldrath with ease just a couple days ago, and I am a L49
paladin with unimpressive gear and did it self-buffed.  For reference
my key stats were:  weapon: ACGS (2hs 30/43), AC: 883, HP: 2280,
MR: 55, no haste item, Valor of Marr (self-haste buff from Luclin)
up.  The ac/hp may be very slightly off, can't recall my other
resists but they did not matter much as he only landed a couple
spells on me (usually root is my friend, but to fight a caster stun
is key, and we have four stuns now at L49 with the two new ones from
Luclin).  Oh, he /con'd light blue.  I was able to single pull him,
but his green to L49 guards would not have changed the outcome of the
fight, maybe they could have forced me to use LH.  If I wanted to
kill him again I would probably try to get my MR up over 70, just
because I hate being Feared, tho he'd have had to land an awful lot
of Fears to take me down, the fight was nowhere near close.

I am thinking that tagging along on a raid is the way to go here, heh.
