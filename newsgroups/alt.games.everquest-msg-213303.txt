A few years ago, when playing EQ, I began to hear odd, distorted voices and
noises in the background. Took me a couple of hours (since it was extremely
distorted) to realize the mic that was attached to my PC was somehow being
enabled by EQ and was channeling the sounds it was picking up into the game,
with an approx. 5 second delay. Needless to say the mic was unplugged that
night and never got plugged back in.
