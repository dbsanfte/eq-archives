 Not really. Most people don't go farming ST for priceless weapons. They
usually only go when the Golems are up so they get a chance at primal.
You can easily kill those three mobs in two hours. With the absence of
the Warders, I'd say the amount of time guilds spend in ST is less than
what it used to be.
