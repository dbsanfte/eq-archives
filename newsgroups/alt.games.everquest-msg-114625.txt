Crown of the Froglok Kings (20 cold/fire) - 750-1k on Tarew Marr
Crown of King Tranix (20 magic) - 6-8k on Tarew Marr

Also, Velium Diamond makes rings (8 all), you want Velium Blue Diamond which
makes bracers(9 all / 11 cold)

Basically any non-silver BD pieces you can get your hands on, and
gold/velium diamond pieces (platinum/electrum/silver diamond is a waste of a
diamond since they're inferior pieces to something using a different metal,
likewise for silver BD which makes a ring worse than velium diamond)

Also, if you're lacking in magic resist gear, you can have Jacinth rings
made, depending on the metal you get MR and possibly AC (velium is 13 MR,
gold is 3 AC / 7 MR, other types aren't worth it, platinum has less MR than
velium and no AC, silver/electrum has negative MR but high AC)

Shroud of Nature is decent also since you're a ranger (8 fire/cold) - ~1k on
Tarew Marr

There's also a droppable 5 resist all necklace that's a rare drop off of any
werewolf, it also drops in the werewolf GM events (I got one back in
Halloween in WC, and then again in Feb at a WC GM event with lots of
werewolf spawns), called Serpent Insignia Collar, note: it is NOT an event
specific item, since I've heard of people killing werewolves when passing
through WK occasionally.
