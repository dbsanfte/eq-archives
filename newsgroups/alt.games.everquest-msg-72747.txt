To me the SoE is mainly a 'convenience' spell. Druids are often asked to
port individuals or groups to Raid/Encounter locations.

Casting SoE makes the journey easier, as most Druids would cast SoW, then
Lev, then Invis (for KOS folks), then See Invis. Quite the time consuming
process. SoE is very practical.

From an RP aspect, I like the fact that Druids can imbue themselves and
others with the powers of Nature. The Spirit of an Eagle provides speed,
flight and acute vision. Granted the 'Ultravision' thing does not match any
of our other spells, but I feel that is a mistake in the opposite direction.
Druids should have a 'Serpent Sight' equivalent earlier on. I always thought
'Eye of the Hawk' would be cool.

SoE does not make a Druid more powerful. Mobs are not going to fall any
faster if the group can see slightly better. Some folks don't like SoE
because the 'bobbing' is distracting. If anything, it makes Druids the
target of a whole new swarm of tells from folks that have SoW, but now want
the SoW+ version!
