KEI is Koadic's Endless Intellect, a very high-level Enchanter
spell.  When cast on you, it greatly increases your rate of mana
recovery.  It lasts for quite a long time (two to three hours), and
is one of the moght highly sought-after buffs in the game.

If something was "nerfed", that means its power was reduced, or got
harder to use, or generally has become less effective.  Kinda like
a steel sword that got transformed into foam rubber.
