>Do they happen anymore? I haven't heard of any in ages...

There was one last night on Karana.  I was at a General raid so I'm not 
sure exactly what happened.

From a guildmate that was there, I heard there was a guy there that they 
all killed ( imagine that ) and he dropped a piece of straw or something.  
They he said the GM said he needed help at his farm in NK.

I assumed that the person who looted the straw would need to go fix his 
scarecrow or something.
