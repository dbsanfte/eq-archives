I can see an arguement in favor of the system as it stands,
I just think its not the only possible system, and that it
makes a mockery of AC for almost everyone.  For
most people for most encounters, its "whats another
100 AC more or less?"

Not the very top end, just the high end.

Over the rest of the game, AC may be functional, but
its not interesting.  I propose a system that would both
be functional -and- interesting, as well as addressing the
failure at the high end.  I'll post an idea as a seperate thread.
