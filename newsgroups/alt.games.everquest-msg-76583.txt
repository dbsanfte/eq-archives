Shardstooth flayed skin is different from the flayed skin that human/erudite
necromancers/shadowknights can wear. It can be worn by most casters,
including high elves. Just be sure to get the Shardstooth flayed skin, not
those described as simply "flayed skin." It's AC 14 with plus 35 hp and mana
and my mage wore it until the mana cap came off at 20.
