Oh come on. Do you really believe that they roll out major fixes without 
any testing? That's absurd. Of course they test it. People just fail to 
realize that the testing performed by the few people at the EQ dev 
offices and then by the not-many-more who play on Test doesn't begin to 
compare to the ringer such changes are put through once they are 
implemented on Live servers. For every change that is so lamented in the 
forums for it's perceived haphazard testing and rollout, I would 
honestly bet that there are a hundred that go in without any trouble at 
all. We just don't tend to hear much about those, though, do we? ;)

Oh, plenty of eyes have rolled about this over the years. The bottom 
line is that it's been this way for a long time now (not that that 
should mean it's ok - just that it shouldn't be getting anyone worked up 
at this point). That combined with the fact that there is another more 
reliable resource makes me inclined to agree with the "it's no big 
deal" crowd. Under the circumstances, it really is no big deal. I think 
the only reason people seem to be balking at the notion that it should 
be fixed is the fact that it seems to be brought up time and time again 
by the same people (no offense, Lance), leading others to believe that 
they're just getting their undies in a bunch unnecessarily.

I'm certainly not one to ignore the shortcomings of SoE (EQ is just 
about the only Sony product I'll consume, with the exception of movies - 
man, the Sony name seems to be on half the films I see, anymore), but I 
do try to maintain some perspective.
