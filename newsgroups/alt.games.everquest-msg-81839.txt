Ok, a few questions...  Don't have invis, but do have camo, that should
work, yes? I use it to run through Kith all the time, and it works there...
in the daytime, anyway. Not brave enough to try <that> in the dark ;) Also,
will I have to go back to RV to get my spells, or is there a  druid guild in
FV? Actually, ex boyfriend had already informed me that it was dangerous...
he had taken one of my characters I wasn't using and gotten her to FV so she
could hold stuff for him. When I smashed my computer in the truck rollover
(long boring story), I also smashed my Kunark disk and HE had to go in and
get her and run her from wherever the heck she was, back to BB. I heard all
about how dangerous the place was ;) Ok, someone else was telling me that
the windmill was a good place to go at my age, as well.

thanks, Vlad!
