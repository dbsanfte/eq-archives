Simple. 

If you don't like your job, you find a new one. 
If you don't like EQ, go find a new MMORPG

If you are abusive to your boss, he'll likely boot you from the job and
force you to find a new one to keep your status as a house owner, food
eater, salami hider
If you are abusive to GMs, they'll likely boot you from their servers
and force you to find a new MMRPG to keep your status as a MMRPG player

You don't *HAVE* to play EQ if you don't want to, neither do you HAVE to
keep a good enough job to keep a decent house. You could get a job
flipping burgers for minimum wage and survive, just as you could play
DAoC, AC, or any other similar games.

The parallel is in how much BS you are willing to take before you pack
your bags and leave, or are forced to leave through your actions. Not
the same ballpark in the grand scale of things, admittedly, but
certainly a parallel.
