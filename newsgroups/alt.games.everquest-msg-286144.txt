Hi there. This thread is intended for you to suggest ways that we
could update the higher levels of our existing skills.

Unlike the 'High Level Content' thread, there is no fixed level limit
for this thread. Instead we would like you to look at the skills and
use your own judgment to decide where the skill needs improving. If
you look at a skill and believe that it effectively stops at level 60
then by all means use that as a starting point for your skill
suggestion. Please note that I will hide posts that are blatantly
asking for low level content though.

If you also see that there is a huge gap in between one new thing that
a skill allows you to do and the next thing that a skill allows you to
do then you can suggest a new item to bridge the gap.

I will be adding a template that you should try to stick to when
making your suggestions. Hopefully this new structure will mean that
it is easier to read your ideas and so you should receive more
feedback on them. As the structure is similar to the structure used
when Jagex Online Support submit ideas to Content Development, it
should also mean that they're able to easier assess the merit of your
idea.

As you should only be providing a summary of your idea, I would
appreciate it if you can try to keep each idea to one post.

Please don't post weapon or armour ideas on this sticky. You should
use the 'New weapon/armour' sticky for those ideas instead.

I will also be adding a 'Highlights index' to this sticky which you
can use to locate some of the best ideas that are posted on this
thread. Due to this I will reserve some threads after my main posts.
Thank you
