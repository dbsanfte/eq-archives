What would be ideal is to have other stuff in the room that spawns
periodically that must be off-tanked.  Possibly even stuff that likes to
aggro on casters.  Bam, you've got the big bruiser of a boss MoB that you
need the big beefy warrior for, and you've got his cleric-killing pal that
has to be taken care of (prefferably by a knight class who can keep his
attention off that nice CH rotation in the corner), and neither can be
single pulled.

Warriros:  Yatta!  I'm needed!
Knights:  Wai!  We're needed!
Big Bruiser Boss and Pal:  Ouch!  We're dead!
Absor:  Smash!
