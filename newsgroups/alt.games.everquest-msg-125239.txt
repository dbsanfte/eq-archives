Greatest hits, 30th anniversary edition.

But then, I've always had a taste for the obscure and humourous.... I used
to sing "I Hold Your Hand in Mine Dear" by Tom Lehrer as a pick up line at
Sci-Fi conventions. If the guy enjoyed me singing and didn't jerk his hand
away, it was a good sign. If he actually joined in, he was a keeper.

P.S. For the curious, here are the lyrics for that wonderful song, copyright
held by T.L.:

I hold your hand in mine, dear,
I press it to my lips.
I take a healthy bite
From your dainty fingertips.

My joy would be complete, dear,
If you were only here,
But still I keep your hand
As a precious souvenir.

The night you died I cut it off,
I really don't know why.
For now each time I kiss it
I get bloodstains on my tie.

I'm sorry now I killed you,
For our love was something fine,
And till they come to get me
I shall hold your hand in mine.
