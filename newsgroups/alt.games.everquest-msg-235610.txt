Not entirely. 

Ranged Melee is a Ranger class defining ability. If Berserkers are
better at ranged melee, so be it... but lets face it... Archery is
pretty sad until end game... it doesn't have to be as good as axe
throwing... but it shouldn't be a joke.

Now that SOE has given decent ranged to another class, rangers long
standing complaint that archery is too weak until endgame should be
addressed. It doesn't even really affect class balance... rangers
might not need tweaking at endgame... just the low-midlevels... 

at least until we see how Berserker endgame plays out...
