Those are quite different from the OOT AC camp.  OOT is a real camp...there
is a single spawn point that spits out a new mob every 6 minutes (IIRC)
after you kill the previous one, and one of the mobs on that spawn point's
table is the AC.  You don't have to worry that the thing might spawn
somewhere else in the zone and someone will gank it ahead of you.
