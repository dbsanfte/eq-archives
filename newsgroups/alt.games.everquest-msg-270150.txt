That should help quieten my favorite beastlord forum.  In the 3 or so
months since, there's been a flurry of spectulation of combines.

I wish I can remember where a list of broken recipies were so I could

I hope this applies to the pool around nexus portal in SH.  I've had
to call for port when I fell in water and couldn't get out.
