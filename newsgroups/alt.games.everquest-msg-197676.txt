I wasn't really planning on responding to you again, but on the off chance
that you're actually being serious for a moment....

Both of the two most active warriors were leveling through thier low 50's.

I was.   And I object to the word received.   I earned every bit of it, by
going on a couple hundred public raids over a period of more than a year.





I'm sure you'll forgive me if I snip the rest of your bullshit about
demanding proof, which is little more than a set of strawmen and cheap
attempts to push someone into defending a patently ridiculous statement,
which can be easily proven false.

(heh... although it would be somewhat amusing to watch you try to "prove" it
false if you followed the rules you want others to use for "evidence.")
