I havent been on test in a while, but do you simple typ /testbuff on an
existing character to get boosted to level 25? If you are a caster are you
given your spells or plat to buy those spells?  What kind of
armor/weaponry are you given?  Do skills also turn out maxxed?

Any info on this is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
