Actually thats not correct.  Regular AA is divided into catagories, and each
of the catagories requires you to have spent a certain amount of AA in the
previous one.  Planar AA for the most part has no prerequisite, except
level.  (some require a certain skill from other AA's, but none require
class title or anything.)

A mage or shaman could buy the summon mass pet AA with thier first 4 AA
points, (I think 4) assuming they level up to 61 first, if they wanted to.
