I'd think Aitch Eee Pally

(and reflexively consider it to mean High Explosive paladin)

I'd also be confused as to whether this was a High Elf paladin or a Half 
Elf paladin we were talking about.  Thus if I -meant- High Elf I'd 
almost certainly say Milky, and... hmm, I don't think I've ever actually 
mentioned the race of a half elf, touchy about the miscegenation perhaps?

Splendid
