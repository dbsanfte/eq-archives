: Thanks for reading... (This is a bit long but I think that there are
: many EQ players who are in the same quagmire I find myself)

: I've created a rut and can't find a way out... any ideas?

I'd recommend starting a new character on the FV server. Pick a combination
of race and class that appeals to you and play it how you'd enjoy it.
Having learnt the ropes with your 39 Ranger, you will find the lower levels
a lot more fun.

And by starting a new - you won't really have the cash to go and twink
yourself out in the bazaar.  Armour that you've earnt yourself is always
more comfortable to wear than someone else's hand me downs.  You never
know - that nice shiny pants you've got on - may have belong to a Troll the
week before!!
