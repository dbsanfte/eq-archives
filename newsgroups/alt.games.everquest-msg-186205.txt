Oh GOD no, not the fiends!  Their DOT is just way too freaking annoying 
to bother with.  After you've done with the Shadeweaver's side, go to 
the Hollowshade side.  More bugs, and if you stand RIGHT where they are, 
the ones around them won't aggro - only the occasional wanderer will (in 
which case, d'oh ;p).  And only the glowing bla bla bugs run when low on 
health.  Sadly, other people know this, so it can be camped - I just ask 
them if they're going to be around for awhile, and if not, yay me, I get 
the spot next ;p  The respawn time is fairly fast, and working up and 
down that tunnel will get you closer to bandit level without requiring 
you to deal with nasty dots every fight.

Oh, and I found out the hard way that the bugs on the shadeweaver side 
DO aggro when you attack their friends.  Stupid bugs, they obviously 
didn't get the "shut up and PL the newbs" memo ;p

How to get to the Shadeweaver side (relatively) safely: I'm assuming you 
took the book, so keep the wall on your right hand side, and stay fairly 
high, while still being careful (I jumped up a rock and then fell for 
obscene amounts of damage, probably a bug but what the hell, I was level 
4 :P) - and watch for the shades, they do tend to wander up the wall 
when you get close to the cave entrance.  If you kind of keep an eye on 
the area to your left, you'll see the path when you get close to the 
tunnel.  There are multiple tunnels, so MAKE SURE you're at the one 
closest to the top of the zone as shown on the map:

http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadeweaversthicketmap.html

When you hit the tunnel, stay high on the walls and keep moving and you 
have about a 50% chance of not aggroing the wandering stuff (which is 
all red, damn them), and turn left, right, then right again to get to 
Paludal.  Once you've gotten inside, I suggest avoiding the bugs until 
you can handle multiple pulls, as they're fairly social.  Go down a path 
until you get to a large cavern.  Make a note of the loc of where you 
exit, because it can be  REALLY hard to find your way out again unless 
you've got LoY maps with you.  Find the mushrooms.  Sensate Reishi 
Sporelings start at level 4.  Work your way around the cavern - they 
repop fast and don't assist or run.  When the larger mushrooms start 
coming into your range, work on them, too.  Keep killing the smaller 
ones, you've got a chance of spawning the higher level versions when you 
do that.

Now, thankfully, Hollowshade is much easier - get a good map of Shar 
Vahl, THAT part is insanely annoying.  Bind there if you're not a 
caster, it's a lot closer than PoK if you die.  Turn right out of Shar 
Vahl and follow the wall - the zone line will push you down to the right 
spot - when you hit the water, look for a cluster of rocks along the 
shoreline, there's a cave entrance in there, and turn right when inside 
the cave to find the entry to PC.  Again, position yourself at the point 
where they spawn, and you won't get assists.  And again, nothing runs 
except the glowing bla bla bugs.  And - yeah, again ;p - kill stuff 
that's gone lblue to you even though it doens't give you exp, because it 
leaves open a spot for something higher to spawn the next time around.  
When you get down the end of that tunnel, run back up, as the next cave 
is chock full of nasty old phlargs who are soooooooooo red and sooooo 
mean at that level, and start again at the top.  They'll be respawning 
by then.
