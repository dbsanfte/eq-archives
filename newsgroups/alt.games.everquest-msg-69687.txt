New graphics?
Many people turn off the character models and drop the clipping plane.
That's almost required for any sort of encounter with more than a
couple of groups in Luclin--even some of the Velious zones are
impossible unless you turn things off.

Most people play this game and continue playing this game for the
content.  The eye candy might be impressive initially, but I don't log
on for several hours to stare at various character models.  I perfer
actual content and I suspect most people would too if they stopped and
thought about it.

Sure it is.
Anything is possible.  The question is are they willing to do it.

New content doesn't have to depend on the new engine.

Almost everyone I know has to drop down their clipping plane
considerably to get decent frame rates.  That pretty much negates a
large chunk of the "ooh-ahh" aspects.

Zones like Fungus, Ssratemple, forget-the-woods-name, the clipping
plane almost always has to be brought in to play decently. 

Attempt to do any sort of multi-group encounter and you have to turn
off character models and reduce the clipping plane or you're gonna get
lagged-deathed.

The whole point is that THIS kind of thing should have been the first
thing they worked on.  The eye candy something that they could have
slip streamed into the system in "a couple of weeks".
