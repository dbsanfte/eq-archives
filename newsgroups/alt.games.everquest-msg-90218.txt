Aggro is similar with a lot of stuff wandering around in Velious. So here's 
some useful spots...

Level 34+  Cougars in Iceclad (pull over the side of TOFS island and run 
them up and down the rocks where there are no adds).

36 or so  Ulthork Hunters/walruses in Eastern Wastes. Don't start bringing 
Ulthork Warriors too until you can handle them since they have much more hp 
than the hunters (i.e. not when 4 hunters takes all your mana).

Low 40s Ulthork Warriors, Rygorr Orcs


I also did zelniaks in Dawnshroud peaks for a bit - low hp, stupid animals 
- but they do turn to run when they're low on health since they aren't 
social so won't realise they have 3 low-on-health buddies with them (I told 
you they were stupid).

Level 46 now, I guess I'm off to Burning Woods.

Oh, Cobalt Scar is the other quad-kite paradise but its usually crowded.
