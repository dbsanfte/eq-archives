My group was accosted by an "insane froglok" in lower guk the other
day. This was a GM running an NPC that ran around the dungeon spouting
insane comments, and asking weird riddles. We messed around with this
guy, and he handed out a few gems to the people in my group. One guy
got a diamond, I got a fire emerald.

He was talking about finding his slippers. Makes me wonder if maybe
another GM somewhere else was giving out slippers that were supposed
to be handed over to the insane frog.
