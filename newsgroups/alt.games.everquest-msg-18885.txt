And don't expect anything like daylight. Even a greater lightstone just
barely illuminates your surroundings and does not give you farsight
at night. For that you need spells like ultravision. Or pleay a race
that has it (Iksar for instance .. actually nearly any race but humans
and erudites have some form of nightvision I think).
