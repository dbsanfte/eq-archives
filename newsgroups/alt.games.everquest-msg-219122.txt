It has been said that the WMBS is better dps than Windblade, despite the
ratio (on this NG as well as other sites).  For a ranger, this jives with
what I've read regarding getting more use out of a damage bonus by
weilding fast 2-handers.  However, when they talk about that at the glade,
it is always accompanied by "with high ATK".  That until you have high
atk, you should be leaning towards better ratios. 

IE, for warriors and rangers, WMBS is better than Windblade...but what
about Knights who cannot get their weapon skills as high, and do not have
innate atk buffs like rangers do?  My husband's SK and guildie's Pally are
trying to sort out what their "final" weapons will be (after training them
all), and we're not sure if they need both Windlbade (for tanking
heavy-hitters) and WMBS (for dps), or if just Windblade would
sufficient.
