Ok, all you folks who are so against rolling in this scenario, and are
so eager to call this person a sociopath and greedy, I challenge you
to post a logical arguement stating why NBG is the way to go.  State
your assumptions, then follow them through to demonstarte why it is
fundamentally greedy to follow NBG vs rolling in a pick-up group.

Let's break this down here.  He is talking about a pick-up group.  He
is grouping with random people he has no allegiance to outside of the
fact that they are other EQ players.  They are not guildies nor
friends.  Just people.

I start with the following assumptions to defend randoming in this
scenario.  If you disagree with me, instead of saying something as
ineffectual as "man, you're just greedy", etc., please post
counterarguements.  These are far more effective in changing opinion
than name-calling.

My assumptions:

1) No person in EQ needs anything.  Each item gained is a luxury that
aids in buffing up your toon to make him stronger, faster, more
skilled, etc.  But nothing like food, water, air, shelter exist. 
Hence, there is really no thing such as "need" in EQ, at least not in
the context of what we think of in RL (where need generally means the
basics elements required to sustain life).

2) Items have no "inherent" value of their own.  Each item's value
resides only in its usefulness to someone.  An item's value may be
immediate (equipping it right away), or delayed (giving it to an alt
at some other point, selling or trading it to buy something you can
better use, etc.)

3) In pick-up groups, the emphasis is not on outfitting or benefitting
any one particular person, unless this is stated up front.  Therefore,
each member has an equal right to gain from the group encounters. 
Members may choose to give their winnings to others in the group (or
others outside the group, for that matter).  But this is not expected,
nor required of any member.

With these assumtions, I must come to the logical conclusion that it
is just as "fair" to random on an item you cannot use immediately as
one you can use immediately.  Either way, the item has value to you
because either 1) You can use it or 2) You can sell/trade it for
something you CAN use.  Therefore, if you participated in the group,
and an item that has value to you (either immediate or delayed value)
drops, you have just as much right to roll on it as anyone else does.

If you still believe in NBG in pickup groups, then you must be doing
one of 3 things:

1) Interpreting my assumptions to come up with a different conclusion
from my own.  If this is true, I would be please to hear your side of
it, as I'm always open to logical arguement that demonstrates a valid
and different point of view from my own.
2) Disagree with my assumptions.  In this case, please tell us which
ones you diagree with and why.
3) Not thinking in a logical manner.  In which case, your opinion is
little more than an emotional whine, and will have no impact in
changing someone's point of view, which I believe is one of the mains
purposes of debate (which I assume we are engaging in).

In any case, I think those who berate this person for his point of
view, without providing any support for their own, are fools.  If you
insist on being rude to people, at least have the intelligence to
defend your opinions.
