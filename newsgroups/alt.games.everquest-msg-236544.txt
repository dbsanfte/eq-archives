Bulletproof isn't the standard being set. Players would just like a
reasonable effort to snuff the cheating out - say to the same extent
EQ did. Not perfect, but enough that little of it goes on and that
that does either gets noticed and fixed or just isn't a big enough
deal for the difficulty in stopping it (like SEQ).

Diablo 2 went way beyond that; the amount of duping that went on at
the higher levels approached universality. (though because I only
played single player / LAN I never did get a Bartocs :-| maybe I
should learn to dupe too)
