If you read 'knowledge and skill' as 'academia and the real world', you can
understand why someone with a degree in computer science (which I have) or
an allied health profession (which I also have) doesn't know jack shit.

Academia doesn't teach you a thing.  It educates you.  All academia gives
you is the background and theory.  You don't get taught about a practical
subject until you hit the real world.

You can learn about performing a crossmatch ... hell, you can even do it on
unknowns in a lab ... but until you're standing in the ER scraping blood off
a backboard for a slide type while the 12 year old gunshot wound victim
writhes around on it, you don't know shit.  Lots of folks with tons of
smarts and great grades fall apart when they see their first real-life
gunshot wound or motor vehicle accident.

You could read about it in a book all you wanted.  You'd still not know how
you handle it under fire until you get yourself in the line of fire and get
someone else's blood under your fingernails (yes, my experience was in a
time before Universal Precautions ... gloves were optional if you could find
them at all).

That's not elitist, man.  That's life.

Now, how does that pertain to the EQ conversation?  It may not.  Frankly, I
just take exception to the belief that once you've read about something,
you've experienced it and can handle it.

So, if you're saying that [reading about something] == [handling it when it
comes along], get ready for your parting gift.
