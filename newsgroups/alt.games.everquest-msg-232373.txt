Actually, once you remove graphics, sound, etc the remainder is a
WHOPPING TON of data. The client is small potatoes. The server is the
entire working world, with often hundreds of NPCS per zone in a game
like Everquest. 

For an eye opener go check out the EQ emulator. They've been messing
with that thing for years and don't really have a stand alone world
server which would actually support players. I think all they have is
the ability to purposefully spawn some mobs and have you go and fight
them. Like spawn vox and have some people fight it, yay. That is a far
cry from an mmorpg game world.

One everquest "Server world" is roughly 27 computers of zones and NPC
data. Each computer might only handle 1 -3 zones. This is why, in the
past, they've patched to move certain zones somewhere else on the
world servers since its best if a very used/high number crunching zone
is with a more dead one on a server. 

All the text, quests, etc that are in the game exist on the server
along with how NPCS behave. Your client is seriously just a dumb
client. 

Comparing it to battlenet, which ONLY is a go between since ALL action
and npcs take place on YOUR computer, is like comparing a horse drawn
cart to a Lexus and telling the guy with the horse drawn cart that it
can't be too hard for him to "be that." Its the exact OPPOSITE of
battlenet.

So, like in EQ, someone would have to bother to write the entire FFXI
world which takes place within the zones and then to host it. There
was a real good quote once, from one of the guys who makes EQ( the
current producer, I think.) He said something like, if you can make an
emulator which runs Everquest as a world like they do that they'd hire
you on the spot because it would be as much work as making your own
mmorpg. That is why he also said no one would really bother. If they
were going to do all that work, having all that know how, they simply
would just make their own mmorpg.

Rowyl was hired away from ShowEQ or something, he is now the EQ
interface programming guy. I'm not sure who else they've hired from
"naughty" programs.

Ah found something about that:

SMEDLEY CHATS ON SHOWEQ, MARCH 25, 2000

"Smed: an emu goes up and I'll hire the first guy that writes a decent
one "

"Smed: after banning him or her of course "

He is kind of a prophet here, this was before Yantis I think,
in regard to why they don't write ebay to remove the auctions(ebay
later did and what he said would happen, did .. ahaha):

"Smed: Asmiene.. we thought about that 
Smed: but what about all the small sites 
Smed: that would just replace Ebay 
Smed: the other day I shut down a site that was taking credit card
numbers for EQ stuff 
Smed: unbelievable"


Prophet here too, though they probably never thought 450,000 or more
by now:

"frizzbee: Any guess as to how many more EQ/Kunark subscriptions you
will get? 300K+? 
Cattj: not mine hehe 
frizzbee: total. 
Smed: we're at 200k subs now 
frizzbee: I know. 
Smed: I'm guessing we'll hit 300k in about 6-8 months"
