   Um, I don't mean to state the painfully obvious, but I would guess that
the whole intent is to make you look as bad as possible, Mr. Perez.   So
your stalker, (yeah, probably Reg) who knows he has an awful rep, is going
to talk in his normal manner to spread some of the creamy goodness your way
(lucky dog!)

   Anyone want to point out what to look for in the headers so that those
who cannot tell by the content can tell the real Bob from the cheap
knockoff Bob?
