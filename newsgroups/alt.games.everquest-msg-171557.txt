I do use both Alure of Death & the Vampiric Curse (sucks that this is our
best DoT leach life...the later LV spells don't give over 200).  I still go
OOM after 2-3 fights in Frontier Mountains fighting blue mobs.  I Dooming
Darkness to pull, Vampiric Curse, send in pet, Fear, Shock of Poison, sit &
med (with Alure of death up also), keep mob feared & sometimes might
Vampiric Curse again when this one runs out if mob is 40% or more (usually
is right about 40% HP by this time).  Keep it feared, sit & med, go loot
mob.  Now down to 50-60% Mana, and thats with 1,199 mana points (185 INT,
+68 Mana, LV29).  So I'd like to know any other secrets to help prevent me
from going OOM as fast.  And as the other person who replied suggested...YES
I DID PUT A POINT INTO MEDITATE (and actually my skill is maxed very shortly
after leveling).
