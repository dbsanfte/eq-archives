<<<<<I have been trying to get a ldon for 2 weeks but when i'm on, i guess few
people in america are up. I'm using a variety of level 20+ guys and getting
nowhere. I'm really looking forward to solo ldon if they get off the ground
with it. Anyone else?>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is the first I've heard about solo LDoN's and I gotta tell you it's the
best news I've heard in a long time.  Have been having real trouble finding a
pickup group anywhere anymore.  I'd so much like to have the option available
to me to solo a LDoN if I've only got an hour.
