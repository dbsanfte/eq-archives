Newspaper merchants sell no-rent newspapers (although they don't buy
them back once you've done reading them).  That's so (I assume) they
only have to maintain one paper object for each city and they can
change the words during a patch without the papers in people's
possessions suddenly getting new words.

If the gem has no apparent use as it is, I can't really see the point
of the no-rentedness of it.  Perhaps it's used in delivery quest,
where you have to take it somewhere before it explodes.  (that's just
speculation though)
