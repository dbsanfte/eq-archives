Both games are a disappointment to me... but to me WoW does not "feel"
like EQ1... EQ2 does....  Also, WoW feels like I'm watching a cartoon,
EQ1 & EQ2 feels like I'm in virtual reality. As for not being able to
see the world until 10, both games have a bit of that, but I suggest
its much greater in WoW.
