If you choose to stay at 62 a while (as I did), get Dire Charm.  DC allows
you to contribute significant DPS and makes groups stop doubting the wisdom
of bringing a chanter along when they already have a KEI.  Eldritch Rune is
the other must-have for me; I can't count how many times it has saved my
bacon.
