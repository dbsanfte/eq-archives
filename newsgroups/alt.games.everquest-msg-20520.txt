There won't be too much to do but you can get to Velious easily, Thurgdain
shouldn't be too much work I think you're probably too high to risk going
much further though. If you want to explore velious get a level 5 bard of
Ralos Zek and you can probably make it to Sky Shrine without to many tries.
Beyond there it's rather hard but you can reach TOV entrance with just one
invis in Siren's grotto.
