Hindu's don't exactly worship Buddha.  If I remember correctly, Hinduism is
a polytheistic religion based off of a bunch of ancient texts (the Vedic
texts come to mind).  Over time, after the advent of Buddhism, Hinduism
eventually incorporated and assimilated some parts of Buddhism into itself.

Just being a smart-ass ; )

Oh, as for we Americans being angry and "trigger-happy" at Muslims, I don't
think that's the case.  Just the ultra right-winged conservatives.
