I've only had a chance to play sporadically, so in game time, by rent came
due basically right after I arrived in Freeport.  Need 5s, have about 1s.
Worse, I've got enough XP to level up to 7 (105%), but it says I can't level
up until I earn citizenship, and I think I have to continue with that first
quest I got in Freeport to do that--and the next step is to talk to the
landlord, which I can't do because I can't get into my apartment without
paying the rent!

The loot that is dropping off mobs is cheap enough that earning another 4s
that way is not exciting.  I did a couple quests around town, but they
didn't give much coin--low enough that they wouldn't be any faster than just
killing mobs.

So, anyone know a quick way to get 5s at level 6?

Many people say EQ2 is trying to cater more to the casual player than EQ1
did.  If so, I think they need to do a bit of tuning in this area.  Maybe
make the first few rental periods tied to /played time rather than real
time, so the casual player doesn't get diverted off into an "earn 5s" grind
while still trying to get into and get used to the game?
