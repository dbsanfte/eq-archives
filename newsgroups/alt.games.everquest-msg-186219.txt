Don't play, or don't play on test? I play so late (witness me posting
at 6 am as we speak) there's rarely anyone on at all anyways.

I don't really act the same way in game as I do out of game. I tend to
get "in character" so to speak, not to the extent that anyone would
call me a roleplayer, but just assuming the in game persona (n.
Persona), and tend to talk about OT things or bizarre occurances
rather than equipment or uberness (having already been there and done
that it holds no awe for me).

Anyways the only forms of mine likely to be seen atm are Lorianne and
Harebell, the two characters I am playing on Test. Lori is L47 now
despite some rough handling in CoM tonight and some extremely long
zone times to EJ (porting in the first time took something like eight
minutes for some reason, its lucky the blind account character wasn't
killed waiting for the screen to come up) and Hare is 39 and has the
dubious distinction of being one of the only druids in existance
wearing both Elysium armor (including tunic yay) and *cloth* armor.
Yeah regular old cloth armor. What can I say, when I get money, Lori
usually gets spoiled and the furball does without. :-p

Older forms would be Betony and Sarafelle from Xev (and a Harebell
there too) and the retired Larabiosa on Test (I just didn't like being
a necro). I think my other characters all predate the serverwide chat
channels since I last played them on Tholuxe, Tribunal, Brell, and
long long LONG ago Povar.


>Go get a dress!

Eh. :-p I prefer to post in the nude.
