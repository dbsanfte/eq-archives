Subject: Harmony... am I doing it wrong?

OK I am fighting a battlemaster.  Up runs an agressor.  I STOP combat entirely
and cast Harmony on the agressor.  Turn and run.  The Harmony spell shows up on
ME.  And both the agressor and the battlemaster are still attacking me.  This
has happened more than once.  Am I doing something wrong? Or is it because they
were both already agro'd on me?
Please advise....
