I went in as a level 11 druid and the top floor was Blue / white to me.
Previously it had greened out at about 9.

Plus the goblin runts seemed very hard to kill.
I snared / dotted and had a damage shield up.
I was using a FS hammer and hitting regularly.
I could not kill these things.

It was as if they were regenerating as fast as I hit.
I was doing lots of damage, but only ever got it down to about half before
I ran for zone with no health (I had skin like diamond so had over 400hps
too)

The other gobos went down easy enough, but the runts were far from.
The runt did not seem to have too many HP (High levelers were taking them
down easy), but did seem to regen or something. I must have done 600+
damage with little effect. Anyone else notice this ?

Cheers,
