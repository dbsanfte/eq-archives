On Drinal it looks like the family clans and soloers are leaving.  I am a 
soloer / small group type and over the past 2 months more than half of my 
friends list has vanished and when I type in a /who all on several clans 
that I have had friends in less than a third of the members I used to see 
on are still around. Our 2 Uber groups, Cats in Hats and Silent Tempest, 
still appear to have large rosters.  Now it may be that an Uber clan who 
loses only a few members in critical areas (Clerics) may be badly hampered 
in their pursuit of High end raid items in Time and GoD so they would be 
affected by a small drop in membership more than any one else.  

I read all of the input from the Druids Glade, Steel Warriors and GU and I 
have to agree with andrew that it looks like its just more of the same 
concentration on the high end rading guilds while the majority of the 
player base is ignored.
