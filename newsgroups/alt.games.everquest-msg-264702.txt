The problem is, this HO system has nothing to do with the ongoing
fight. It's like playing a seperate game, say gem, along the battle,
and whenever you successfully remove a line of gems you get a
beneficial result.

In EQlive, tactics depend on the battles. You have to choose the right
time to taunt, slow, mez and heal. But in HO system, it doesn't
matter, you don't make choice, you just follow a randomly chosen
sequence while at same time spaming the very limited number of spells.

I could accept if this HO system were based on mobs' reaction. Like in
some MMORPGs, mobs will show some venerability during the fight and if
you grab the chance and use the right skill, you inflict more damages.

But in EQ2, HO is just another mini-game you play, totally independent
of the fight. Veteran players are not skilled at battlefield
judgement, they are skilled at following a sequence.  Can we really
call this smart tactics? And once you "master" such tactics, will it
even change with respect to your group/class/level or mobs?
