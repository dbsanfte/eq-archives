I've been hunting in Najena for my mage focus items.
Being lvl 27 and not able to find a group, I was simply hunting some
tentacles and Darkboned skeletons.

After a few rounds of killing and medding a lvl 22 ranger joined me so the
nuking became a lot easier.

After we killed a couple of Darkboned skeletons I looted and to my surprise:
A Broom!
First I was ecstatic, then it struck me: what the hell was a Broom doing on
a skeleton? They are supposed to be only dropped by magicians in Najena,
aren't they?

The DBSkel was blue to me and I killed the spawn moments after it popped, so
no player could have given the broom to it.

Anyone able to verify this?

Ok.  So you got there.  Saw the skel pop.  You killed it.   You looted a
broom.

What, exactly, are you hoping someone will verify?
