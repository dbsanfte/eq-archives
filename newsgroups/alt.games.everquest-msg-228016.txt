HI All;

Thank you all for the many answers, great thoughts and suggestions.  I have
always dreaded the thought of spending my RL time sitting on my butt for
hours. At 56 years old I have the attention span of a baby...LOL.

2 of my RL friends that I play with have also started their various epics,
sooooooo.....time to start mine and we can help each other on the non raid
parts.  I thought I would do the boring parts first, like Bergurgle,
Grimblox and the Pear Shards.  I'm in a small, family guild so getting a
small raid force together takes some doing. We did the King in Chardok last
week while going after the Prince for our enchanter, so I have that part out
of the way.

I was hoping I could get lucky like I did with Lord Bergurgle where I camped
nearby after sitting for about 3hrs killing PH's. The next morning I logged
in and there he was.

I will definitely look for that "secret hallway" and see if I can camp/login
there.

Take Care All and again, Thank you for the responses.
