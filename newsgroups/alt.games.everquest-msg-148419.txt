Using the Hammer of Judgement, I proc rarely at a 125 dex, and a LOT
at 200 dex.  Blowing off using Yaulp V makes such a noticable difference
there that I can identify the stretches where I've been on the phone or
soemthing and haven't been punching YV regularly, just by scrolling up and
looking for procs.

Perhaps each weapon, rather than having a simple "proc rate" attached, has
a "dex threshold" built in as well, so that one weapon would see a difference
between 70 and 100 but not much over that, and another at say 120 versus
150, and another at say 200 versus 230?

At any rate, I've also seen other weapons such as Righteousness display
a very noticable difference when I add in an extra 100 dex or so, from
Sword Dancing or Boon of the Garou.  I have a "dex ranger" friend who
swears by his 255 dex, lives on procs and archery.  He seems to proc
a lot, too, but doesn't have the advantage of a 75 point swing in dex just
by casting a short duration spell, with which to see what difference it
makes.
