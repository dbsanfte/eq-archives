What fun last night. I finished work at 9 pm, got home at 9:15. PoF
guild raid was scheduled to start at 9:00 but to my surprise things
were not underway. I rushed over and quickly joined a group. That
should have been my tip-off: I was in group 7 (?!) and recognized only
2 people in the group.

Raid leader issued the standard instructions: everyone has
invisibility and see invis. On zone-in turn immediately left and run
to camp. Break-in groups were already there.

Fine. No problem. We know how to do Fear. Wrong. We got wiped out. It
wasn't even close. Mobs were everywhere.

I found out later what happened. We had a ton of guild invitees with
us. Some apparently decided to turn to their other left when they
zoned in. They ran around and aggroed a bunch of mobs then ran for the
camp.

It got better. I was rezzed by a guild cleric. I appeared, bend down
to loot my corpse and was immediately killed by a mob that was IN THE
CAMP at the time I was rezzed. Wipeout #2. When things were more under
control the rezzers did their stuff. I looted my corpse, sat down to
med and was immediately killed by a mob. Wipeout #3.

Sigh. Should be interesting to read the discussion on our boards
today.
