I am having a problem with Everquest and the Visa Billing, 

I used my Visa card to pay for my son's Everquest account about 8 months ago, This is the only time
I have used my Visa Card online. The last 2 Everquest billings have shown on my Visa bill but along
with them there has also been 2 other billings from unrelated online companies. How did they get my
Visa Information???

I read on the Everquest website that they had been Hacked and it had been reported in the Seattle
times. 

I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to deal with Sony Online and I am just being "Jacked" around,
They say it is impossible that the problem is from their end and have told me to look elsewhere.
This is odd concidering that Sony Online is the only online company that I have given my Visa Card
info too.

 Please check your Visa bills for strange billings, The 2 that I received were from "Flooz.com"
($95 US) and "DeltaThree.com" ($50 US).  

If you too have strange billings from online companies please E-mail me at mytechmail@email.com

Thanks loads

Greg
