I was looking forward to this expansion until i realised that most of the
new spells for wizards where laughable.

No real nuke upgrades.
No bigger AE radius upgrades.
Just lower nukes with lower resists <- grrr

I think its a cheat that VI introduce us with nukes that have low damage and
low resist. Wizards should already from BEFORE have a different resist/force
table from other casters (since they are the only 100% mana dependent
class - I think they are supposed to get this ability from level 35 although
i'm not 100% sure).

This is the reason for VI new patch on RESIST TABLES that everyone was
furious about.
Instead of making NUKES nuke for more, they want them to do less damage over
time.
Seriously... other classes should start thinking, because if they are
indirectly making wizard nukes easier to resist (not lures, but normal
nukes), they are indirectly nerfing alot of other classes nukes with their
resist tables!

I hear it seems quite a few people will be quitting when this expansion get
released, and i too is starting to get tired of VI design toying with us.
