The last 10 lines are reported. It doesn't matter where you are in the text
box or what size the box is. For instance:

Dork says, "you suck."

is one line. If you resize the chat window so that it reads:

Dork says,
"you suck."

then it's still one line. To report more than 10 lines, you need to zone,
report, zone, report, etc. Seems a bit odd, but it was from someone official
on the message boards.
