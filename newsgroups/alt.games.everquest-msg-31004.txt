I get the feeling I can.  I'm just starting to get the root/rot down *very*
well, judging my distances to med and not pulling adds.  Confidence is key.
Side note, it usually takes several shaky minutes on the mouse once I log
into EQ after getting home from work until I'm at ease again.  Most of the
times I've died - which aren't many - were usually during the first 10-20
minutes after logging on...

Not too bad now at 19 because of this one lucious spell - careless
lightning.  I was kinda saving it because it took alot of mana, but I got a
little tired of the green backround in NK and decided to head back to Oasis
for some good steady solo'n.  I root/rot a few blues (crypt mummy's, some
deepwater crocs) for awhile and find the same old thing of being left at not
much mana - although in my defense, If I root/rot right on the money with
minimal mob resists, I can usually mow through 1-3 blue mobs starting from
full mana with *no* downtime in between mobs - other than the med while the
DoT is going.  Now later at full I tried some snare/nuke kiting with
careless lightning, leading me to one conclusion - me likey careless
lightning.  I was blasting the living snot out of mobs in a bubble or 2 of
mana WAY beyond what that puny 30something ignite had been doing.   I think
I'm still more mana efficient doing root/rot right now but man, that cl is a
helluva cleaner upper.

Things I'm most looking forward to in my impending druidic maturity:

1.)  surname at 20 (still no idea)

2.)  Tracking at 20

3.)  New 24th spells and most importantly - wolf form, at 24.  It is 24
right for wf isn't it?

It was one of those rare times everything was running like clockwork.  I'v
mentioned before but I've had this account since EQ launched and played
pretty religiously that first month or so and got into grouping right off
the bat.  Yeah, I remember one of the first groups I joined with my druid;
guy asks me if I want to join a group - I join up, we run to CB, zone in and
die.  heh.  Man I was pissed at that guy -but in retrospect, at launch,
scant few of us really knew wtf was going on in Norrath.

This group at Highpass was good - and all drop-ins.  What was a mess waiting
to happen with everyone trying to solo the orcs, cleaned up right fast when
the tank started inviting.  Still, this griffawn I had running around NK for
me last night (seemed like 4 minutes or more!) must have taken down 3 or 4
borer beetles (all blue to me) and still needed a fair amount of work to
finish once it finally turned on me.  We were quite the group me and my
griffawn.  I think if I could have named it (like pets in UO), I would have
called it "Mad Eagle" or "Beetle Slayer".
