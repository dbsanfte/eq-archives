Hmm.  I hadn't realized Test was that low.  But I think Test has a
much different dynamic with regards to its playerbase, or at least I
gathered as much from some of your posts:

-- It always had a lower population, so the normal denizens were
accustomed to it.
-- Because of the smaller player-base, it was a much tighter-knit
group, especially amongst the higher levels. (once you got past the
/testbuff + a couple range).  A lot of the crap that gets pulled on
mainstream servers wouldn't fly on test because of the inability to
ever group or raid again
(feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)

But if a production server started approaching those numbers, I think
it would produce a different feeling.  The feeling that it is getting
quieter.  It can be an odd dynamic if you're not used to it.  It might
leave a sever with a small core of dedicated people, as the ones most
likely to stay which would give a dynamic closer to Test, but it still
wouldn't be quite there.
