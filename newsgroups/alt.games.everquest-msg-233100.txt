Time rotations work great with 3 guilds, its still optional to clear in 1
day. More than that makes it a sliding interval rotation though.. pain
We've had 3 since last year, thank god the furthest ep guild still hasn't
killed Fennin..

Btw did nobody on your server suddenly become coir killable (when they
werent before the melee discs?)
On the 2 servers i take interest in, it was quite noticable. Being able to
keep a 4x base damage disc up the entire duration of Coir's life makes the
whole encounter at least 15% or so easier

Correcting myself.. i meant 36 of course. But yeah, agree 100%
We did a Time level MM the other day.. usual drill, zone in invis, move to
prep spot before we start killing (killing when the whole raid is in the
zone).  Now time MM has a death cap (36 i think.. heard anything from 30 to
40.. anyway, its not very high).

So we zone in. In typical fashion when 36 people zone together.. they end up
popping in 1-5's.  Who should be at the zonein, but a see invis mob. The
resulting chain agro on 5 1k+ hitting mobs meant people were dieing as they
appeared in zone.. wow what a start.  25 of our death limit used within 1
minute of entering the dungeon...

Death limits is a great idea.. I mean, if people can no longer kill <insert
any mob from kunark to pop> by throwing massive numbers at it, constantly
rezzing and rushing back in.. well good. Zerg forces suck.
But small death limits where every single trash pull can result in death
(all unmezzable in MM.. ultra high resistance to slow), coupled with all the
annoying other "features" of ldon...

1 good thing I will say about Ldon raids.. theres a lot more thinking
outside the box than any other raid zone.  I like that.. no more "corner
mob, manage agro, make his hp <0 before yours" like pretty much every other
raid mob in the game..
E.g MM ep level, the 3 named who must be kept within 10% of each other at
all times or they heal to full - semi-fun different kind of fight.. but
hours of trash clearing, for loot no better than PoFire or Water (which
requires almost zero clearing.. invis to the spot and just pull the damn
thing).  You'd think they would learn why PoA is woefully unpopulated in
comparison to Fire/Water.. seems to balance it they just made the whole
expansion like another PoA!

Its a cool concept, but then EQ has had a lot of cool concepts, that when
its released is a shoddy fuckup... so i will hold judgement on it for now.
Having multiple weapons all have a real use is a nice idea though... as
things stand, right now just get a 2h and you have the best weap in all
situations.

We used to reform almost by force of habit.  We made new groups in p5, and
again for quarm.  Typical drill was to just disband from the raid and make a
new one, with the new group leaders instantly able to invite.
This all went well until 1 or 2 weeks ago.. we reformed the raid, then could
no longer get people back in from PoTa, nor the GY. People who had gated out
to invite latecomers were also locked out.

Well seeing Quarm is a good indication they took your instance...

We've had the guild after us in the rotation go into time the day after we
kill Quarm, kill phase 1.. and end up in a totally empty zone.  Assumed they
had our instance, but never knew for sure

>  Oh, and don't forget the random raid drops.

Well thats been there so long, its more like a known feature now!
We have some people who crash / drop from raid every time they die (and
leave potimeb) or click yes to the rez (to enter timeb)

Oh and of course, when your guild all clicks into timeb for phase 1, and the
portal tells you its out of charges (forget exact text).. so you end up with
a handful of people stuck outside, having to spam click before they can get
in!

Ah well, PoTime is still my favourite end game zone of all expansions to
date!
