Do you think perhaps it's possible that the nerf isn't aimed at solo
techniques? Everyone assumes it is, but can you think of any non-solo
situations where archery not breaking root could trivialize
encounters? Someone half jokingly referred to the possibility of "Team
Ranger", but I'm sure most of the high-end mobs that would be worth
the effort are unrootable anyway...

You were reliably and safely quadding wyverns before 49? Damn, you're
the first I know of to pull that off... And, no, I don't regard
root-rotting as ineffeciant. In fact, I specificly said that it was
one of the MOST effecient solo methods. Definately safer than
quadding.
