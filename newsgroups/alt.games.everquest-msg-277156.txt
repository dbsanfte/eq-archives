This is known as, "It seems to be working in World of Warcraft, so lets give 
it a shot here." All quest rewards are no drop in WoW, of course if you are 
an enchanter in WoW you can make use of every rewards, but everyone can sell 
the reward no matter what. Also what I remember of EQ2 quest rewards they 
are more often something you can use, while in WoW they are set by the 
quest, so you may not even be able to make use of the item except to sell 
it. Personally I like it, it makes people quest for items not quest for the 
best price for items. You still sell the normal drops and all is good. (Note 
I also like that every magic item in WoW is attunable, so you can never pass 
down anything you actually use)
