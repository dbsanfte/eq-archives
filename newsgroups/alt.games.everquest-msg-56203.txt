It'd be fun if the "Monster" button had a very tiny
chance of putting you into a high-level monster.
Imagine being Lady Vox for a day...

Unfortunately, that would quickly be abused.
"Hey, Joe, I'm Gorenaire right now, get the guild
together to come kill me, I'll roll over and play
dead so we can get some phat lewt".

Maybe they could fix that by making it so that
if it put you into a high-level monster, it would
not be lootable.  It'd just be about the thrill of
battle as an uber-monster.
