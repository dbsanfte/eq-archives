Well, technically, I think sharing your account with your child violates 
the EULA.  So I really doubt Sony would even consider adding a feature to 
make it easier.  They might let you flag the whole account as belonging 
to a juvenile delinquent... But personally, I think it's a fine idea.  
However, in a game with very few wheels, 'child at the wheel' seems an odd 
name for the command.  How about /kid? :)
