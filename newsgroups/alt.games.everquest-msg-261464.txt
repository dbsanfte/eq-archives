       Berserker: Traditional duty: melee damage output.   Other roles: 
snarer, caster interrupt, ghetto slows, backup tank.   Decent solo 
class.   A berzerker is a moderately good DPS class, and gets enough HP, 
AC, and avoidance to be a good "off-tank."   Can serve as primary tank 
on mobs which are stunnable.  Value on a raid is currently minimal, 
sheer DPS and there are classes which out DPS them.
	Berzekers have no mana bar to worry about, but instead use up "basic 
axe components" which are available very cheaply from their vendors in 
order to fuel their abilities, which are stun, snare, and "jolt", the 
latter resembles the ranger spell and reduces the degree to which a mob 
hates them.  All share a single 12 second timer, and are short duration, 
but the absence of a mana bar means they can be used nearly infinitely 
(as long as supplies hold out, which could mean 106 hours 48 minutes of 
continuous use), and all take effect instantly
	Berserkers solo fairly well as long as they can single pull; the key 
berserker ability is the stun, which should be used constantly on non 
casters in order to slow the damage they do (on casters it may be held 
in reserve to stop their spells); adds won't be stunned and thus will do 
full damage.  In groups, stun use can easily overwhelm an unskilled 
tank's ability to hold aggro; again this is the 'zerker's key 
contribution, so finding a way to work with this should be found.  The 
use of stun as an aggro producer allows the berserker to hold aggro 
fairly well if in the position of primary tank.  It is important for the 
Berserker to maximize his defensive skills either by soloing or serving 
as primary tank, as he will be thrust into the "punching bag" position 
with some frequency thruout his carreer.
	Berserkers consider themselves an "unfinished" class; the newest class 
in the game, it seems to most that they are lacking features which would 
make them desirable in the higher levels.  Up into the high 50s this 
isn't an issue for a non raider; the berserker's position as a "medium 
tank" capable of both high DPS (for a primary tank) and good damage 
soaking (for a light tank) makes them flexible and enjoyable to play, 
and the fact that they have a short list of special abilities instead of 
a spellbook full of options should make them easy to learn and to play, 
even for a novice EQ player; I'd reccomend them highly as a first class.
