Where I live, cable access is 5 times faster and half as expensive as DSL.

Cable is also very easy to hook into your home network compared to an
internal DSL adapter.

DSL also required me to "dial in" which took 20 seconds or so where the
cable I have now is always on.

Moving to DSL broadband from dial up was "amazing" but moving up from DSL to
Cable was even better.  I regret ever having tried DSL.
