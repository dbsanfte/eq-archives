Hey, better yet, why don't they just make the bazaar completely
text-based. Also, only lower case text and semi-colons as opposed to
full colons. Single quotes instead of double. I mean, heck, it's not
like I bought the Luclin expansion for nice graphics or anything.

Seriously though, I do agree that the pets/familiars should be nuked
upon arrival and their casting inhibited. It's just stupid and/or rude
to contribute to the lag in that particular zone by dragging one
around for no reason.
