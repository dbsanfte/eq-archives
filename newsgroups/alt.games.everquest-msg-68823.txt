I couldn't get it to work.  I installed the most recent driver
for the Voodoo 2 I could find, and installed DirectX 8.1, but
EQ wouldn't work.

Finally broke down and installed the Voodoo 3 that had been sitting
in the corner for two years.  I've been very pleased so far, although
I haven't installed Luclin yet.  Very satisfied with frame rates
everywhere else, though.  W98/256M RAM/450Mhz
