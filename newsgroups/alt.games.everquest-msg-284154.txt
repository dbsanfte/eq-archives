Last night, we put together a force to go after Emperor Crush. The team
consisted of

70 Warrior
68 Paladin
70 Shaman
70 Ranger
70 Enchanter
70 Cleric (me)

I was a little leery about bringing the lowbie Paladin, but some of the
others had grouped with him before and vouched for his veracity.

The orcs at zone in proved little problem and we quickly progressed
toward the castle. But the closer we got to the castle, the more
numerous, and more dangerous, the orcs became. At the castle entrance,
we were confronted with two orc legionnaires and an orc shaman.
Fortunately, the Enchanter knew his stuff and we were able to take them
out piecemeal.

We finally made our way to the throne room. The entrance of the throne
room is out of agro range of Emperor Crush so we were able to heal and
med up. Then the time came. We pulled Crush and the battle ensued.
After several attempts, the Shaman was able to land a slow and things
were looking pretty good. We got a few adds but once again, the
Enchanter proved his metal and kept things under control. I could
almost taste that Dwarven Ringmail Tunic. Then Ambassador Dvinn showed
up. By this time, the Enchanter was oom, but fortunately the Paladin
was able to off tank him - I'm sorry I ever doubted the little guy.
I'll admit it was a bit dicey, but between the Shaman and me we somehow
managed to keep both the Warrior and Paladin alive. Crush dropped, then
Dvinn. Shouts of "Woot!" and "Well done!" resounded.

After rezzing the Ranger, we /randomed for the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic.
Though I did not win, this is one event I will not soon forget.
