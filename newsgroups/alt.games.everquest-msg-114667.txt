How? I mean, without POTG and Regrowth and the like? I just made
a new necro, twinked with cloth armour and all the spells and
my partner made a new chanter, twinked the same way and it took

(Of course, now we know we like the classes the twinking is somewhat
different, but the first 10 levels were cloth & spells ;) )
