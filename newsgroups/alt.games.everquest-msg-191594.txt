I'm not saying someone would definitely see it.  I'm saying that there is
too much chance for a thief to count on no one seeing anything.  I would
guess if there's even a 5% chance of being caught it would make someone
considering it reconsider since at that level rep makes a big difference (or
so I hear).  Also, if anyone is logging to file that would make it even
easier to get caught.
