Replaced it with a Braided Coldain beard, since the Lesser Tar Goos were
nice enough to drop one.

There is the fact that I tend to solo alot, due to my work schedule.  Wis
does have a place in my line up.

Melatite to drop.

Cool, I'll hold off on that, then.

Nice.  I know I can get our 52 druid to play there.

Limited on melatite.
