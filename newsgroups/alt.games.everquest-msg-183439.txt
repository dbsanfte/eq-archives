Febuary 25th 2003

   Not bad I just ran into a frog that's level 50.  So kermit my man
how did you get to level 50 in a few days?  "Power leveling brother
its all about power leveling"  Interesting concept I thought My
Necromancer is at level 16 and I have been playing about a month give
or take.  My question is what exactly is Power Leveling?  Any help
would be appreciated.  I'm a relatively a new player and don't know
all the in's and out's of the game. so if someone could fill me in on
leveling it would be appreciated.

thanks in Advance Nightwind
