    Thott's tests were all very conveniently rigged towards the shaman. You
mention some of the issues in your post, but you neglect to mention four
things that affect the modern player: slow resists, slow mitigation,
external slowing, and disasters.

    Thott's graphs represent his assumption of an "average" amount of slow
resists. He doesn't actually compute a series of graphs showing initial slow
landing cleanly, then slowed after one resist, then slowed after two
resists. If he had done so, you would have seen a horrific dip in maximum
mob DPS allowed on the one and two resist graphs. If a shaman doesn't land
slow, he's just allowed the MT to take four or six seconds of damage with
nothing to show for it. This dip in DPS allowable makes the cleric the
preferred healer if the mobs being killed aren't low-resist, as the cleric
doesn't suffer from resists.

    Slow mitigation also changes the numbers to favour the cleric. If our
shaman is only doing a net 50% slow, or 40%, he's going to have to heal a
lot more damage than the graphs indicate. Specifically, a 50% versus 75%
slow means cutting the maximum DPS asymptote by 33%, to 2/3rds what his
graphs indicate. Quite a drop, and slow mitigation is very common in mid and
upper PoP zones.

    External slowing also favours the cleric. If you just put level 65
shaman heals up against level 65 cleric heals (no SHM slowing), the cleric
will come out on top. That is the situation if the party has another person
casting slows (bard, enchanter, BST). If you assume that the shaman still
slows while the cleric leaves slowing to another player, the situation
becomes even further slanted in favour of the cleric. While groups with only
a shaman as healer and slower might be common at lower levels, with
characters that are horribly twinked and imbalanced compared with their
environment, by higher levels it becomes much more uncommon. The shaman
can't keep up with being the only source of heals, slows, haste, and SHM HP
buffs (two buffs the shaman has to do, one being short-term, versus the one
long-term buff of the cleric).

    Finally, you have "disasters". This is when you don't manage to single
pull mobs all day, but instead get adds. When disaster strikes, the much
higher short-term healing per second of a cleric makes them far and away the
best healer to have in group. A shaman's "fast" heals are laughable in size
and speed, and the shaman simply can't keep people alive through a disaster.
The shaman also doesn't have low-aggro solutions available like HoT's when
having the healer killed by adds is a distinct possibility, and doesn't have
the survivability of a cleric if aggro does transfer to the healer.

    Thott also didn't count AA's like Divine Arbitration and Celestial
Regeneration/Renewal, but things like Div Arb might be a bit difficult to
account for.

    They've been pulling your leg here. ;-) Max HPs from buffs, 65 WAR with
max STA, is 618 (Nine) + 544 (Seven) + 910 (Kazad) + 330 (BSS) = 2402.
Looking on EQRankings, the top theoretical warrior profile is at 9528 HPs
unbuffed, and one of the top "real" warrior profiles is at 8567 unbuffed
(Waihung, Afterlife). So you're looking at the highest HP tank in the game
right now being just shy of 11 K buffed, and the top theoretical tank being
just shy of 12 K. They might be able to add more HPs from LDoN augments, but
so far I haven't seen enough augments in game to give more than 1 K total to
a warrior, assuming they had the time to win the 300 adventures at Hard
difficulty to get them all (they need 500 adventure wins to max out the
augment on their charm slot). Most Time warriors I know are between 10 K and
10500 HPs with full buffs.

    More than that, even assuming you're counting the average increase on
Marr's Gift (not max theoretical) and not including any average increase
over time due to crits. Or are you talking about average increase on
Complete Heal with max AHA/AHG? Also, do we actually get better crit chances
with HG/AHG? I was always under the impression it was the same for all
classes, 16% at max AHG, crit for double healing.

    Thott always buries his errors in his "assumptions". I wouldn't worry
about it. ;-)
