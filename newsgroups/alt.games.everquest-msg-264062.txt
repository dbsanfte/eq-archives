Don't see why people don't get this. Even the EQlive and EQ2 teams are
different dev teams. Compare CS and development of SWG and EQLive, and
there's a huge difference. EQ comes out looking like paradise. :p Now,
with EQ2, we can't know what to expect yet. Yes, they're both SOE
projects...but completely different teams on each. As far as I can
tell, each game's team sets their own rules. The only thing that's the
same is the guys upstairs cutting the checks, and they seem to have
learned to back off and let the teams do their own thing for the most
part.
