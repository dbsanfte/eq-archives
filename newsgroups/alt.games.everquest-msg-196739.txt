The spell lists there allow you to go to detailed listings of the spells
that tell you a) how long they last and b) how much they do - should be
simple to work out DPS if its not already explcitly there. THe advantage
being all classes are listed there.

It may be that allakhazam has it buried in the description for specific
spell scrolls as well
