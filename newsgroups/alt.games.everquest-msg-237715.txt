Tell them about the cable, explain what happened, and then be yourself and
take part in whatever you fancy.

If they can't deal with that (and I'm sure they will), then they aren't
worth joining (but I'm sure they are).

Real life gets in the way of the game all the time, everyone understands
that.  Yeh, you get frustrated when folk go LD, but you understand deal and
move on.

Best bet is to be open, honest and just let them know how you feel.
