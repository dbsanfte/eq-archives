/sigh

Yes. I did. Perhaps one should thank one's parents one even exists, 
instead of blaming them for being genetically imperfect, and progating 
some of that to oneself.

Nobody. It isn't a fault that needs blame assigned.

Nobody is denying that genetics is real here. I'm not contesting that.

That is your choice. And that *SHOULD BE* up to you to choose.

Not ignored no. But not exterminated either, perhaps.

Even you just now assigned responsibility for genetic variance to 
"Mother Nature"... what happened to putting the BLAME on the PARENTS??

And that's my point. All parents do is bring a myriad of possibility to 
the table. They have little control over whether the offspring will be a 
prodigy, beautiful, brilliant, retarded, handicapped, or even nonviable. 
Blaming them for something that really is way out of their hands is just 
  cruel and ignorant.

Granted the cards are stacked, and parents often do have an inkling 
about liklihood and probabilities... for things like hair or skin 
colour, and many other conditions including mental defects... some 
people know more than others... but every child is a crapshoot; we've 
all got enough garbage floating around in our genes to result in a 
genetic product that will have a short painful life.

As an ideal, I don't think anyone but the individual parents have the 
right to decide when the odds are too high, and I don't think you, me, 
or anyone else has the right to blame them, and hold them liable for any 
genetic shortcomings that you or anyone else perceives in the result.

(Naturally, its just an ideal, there are people who are incapable of 
making a rational decision on whether to have children, and would choose 
highly incestuous pairing, or have children who are virtually certain to 
be non-viable... and I accept coping with them as the price of ensuring 
that those who are capable aren't trampled on.. but this is a long long 
way from the blaming the fact that some kid commited suicide over EQ on 
his parents 'bad genes'.)
