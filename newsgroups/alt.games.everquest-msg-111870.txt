First, just having someone to SoW helped this group alot. Made pulling
easier, gave a "way out" if things turned sour. Most people appreciate that.

Hey, Druids are generally a "backup healing" class in a group. You did great
here, if you throw out an occasional heal, you are doing well, and as others
suggested, you are better suited to healing in a group like this than even a
cleric would have been.

Don't underestimate the value of a DS. At higher levels where the tanks get
hit more often, a DS is often the most mana efficient damaging spell in the
game. As long as the main tank keeps aggro most of the time, you can easily
do more damage with a DS (over 2-3 pulls) than any other DD you could cast.

Its true, Druids are the second best porters in the game :). But anyone who
can port is better than no one :). Heck, you should have lesser succor by
now, so you could have saved the whole group if something went REALLY bad.

Your buffs looked fine, and I'm sure the SKs liked having a healer around,
even if they weren't getting hurt too much. I've been in lots of groups
where we don't get hurt much, but having a healer around decreases downtime
and adds a level of security.

If you are the only healer find yourself with excess mana, DoTs and DD are a
great way to add to a groups effectiveness, also snaring running mobs helps
out (but I guess the SKs did that). Still, a druid isn't really best at any
task... but not that far behind in 5-6 categories. We give up being UBER in
any ONE way so that we can help out a group in several other ways.

Later in life, if will be rare you are primary healer, that's a clerics role
generally. If you group has no cleric you are on heals. If no wiz/mage, you
are on DD. If no enchanter/bard, you are on Crowd Control. You SoW, buff,
heal, snare, port, evac, root, DS, etc. Druids can join just about any group
and make it more effective, heck if you are in your 20s, you can heal, buff,
DD and even melee a bit.

Sure, there isn't a lot of time that a group says "we really need a druid
here" over any other class... but there are even less times that they say
"no, a druid wouldn't do anything for us in this group".
