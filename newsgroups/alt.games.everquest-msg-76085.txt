I have a character on bertox named computeq and he is a 1 year old in RL
lvl41 ranger and just the other day I was informed by a guide that I needed
to think of a new name as I was in violation and he would send in a report
for a senior guide or a gm to change it. I found this interesting as I have
petitioned from this character on various issues around 10 times or so in
his life and never had an issue. I have played my ranger for the past 4 days
using the gm-list button I wanted to head off any trouble by petitioning and
informing the on-duty GM and not once have I seen anything higher on the gm
list than a guide. This bothers me as well.
