I'm puzzled.  Firstly, why does this geek think that anyone'd believe Sony
would use a Hotmail account, when usually only spammers, crooks and other
nefarious nasties use it - present company excepted, OBVIOUSLY...  :o)

Um...  Thirdly, or thereabouts, why does he have so much trouble deciding
which of his aliases to use today?

And lastly why is he so crap at setting up which name to use anyway?

There's obviously a history here, but I'm afraid I've missed it.
