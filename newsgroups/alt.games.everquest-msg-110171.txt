    See if you can get some Crystalline Silks, and play with them first.
Killing stuff in Velk's isn't too hard, and I bet if you auctioned for them
in Velk's you'd get a whole bunch fast (most people don't value them). I
cringe when I think of using those vials of mana at a skill lower than the
max triv on Crystalline Silks, but I think that's because I used my own
enchanter to make the vials I used.

    And tailoring is precisely the skill to raise to the Wu's trivial cap.
I'm guessing that some of the Velious armours will have lowered trivials,
meaning you'll be able to make some of the nifty stuff with your max Wu's
skill. But we'll see, won't we?
