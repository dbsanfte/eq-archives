Can be even more dangerous with a map.

Was in Paludal, seen lots of bandits near the zone to Shadow Haven, and 
they didnt aggro. Then i take a wrong turn and end up with some dwarves. 
Looking at my map to find the right way, and notice that the description 
  on the map say bandits. So i promtly fire a nuke at the nearest dwarf, 
died around 3 sec later, they were not afraid of my high level, they 
were red to me and not attacking.
