Did I say I lost anything in the deal?

Where do you see me whining in my post? 

The actions I witnessed looked suspicious. So I reported them here as
a warning to others. Since when is reporting a suspicous act
considerred "whining"? Keeping people mindful of potential scammers is
never a bad thing, and certainly not whining.

Maybe I am a bit paranoid, and maybe I read the actions incorrectly,
but I don't think my post deserves the angry and sarcastic response
you made.


Cheers
