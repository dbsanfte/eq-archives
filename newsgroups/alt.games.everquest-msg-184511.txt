Obsessed EverQuest Fan Found Guilty of Manslaughter
Father convicted after neglect and abuse lead to son's death.
 
January 03, 2001 - Was a man so involved in his favorite online
role-playing game that he allowed his infant son to die? For friends,
family, and law officers in Tampa, Florida this is a question lacking
any real answer.
According to the St. Petersburg Times Online, the favorite pastime of
one Tony Lamont Bragg, EverQuest, was in fact being played by the
guilty father before, during, and after the death of his
nine-month-old son, Tony Bragg Jr.

So engrossed with his session of EverQuest was Bragg that his answer
to his boy's crying was to somehow squeeze him to death, possibly
slamming his body into a sturdy doorframe (as later stated by Tony
Sr.). Enclosing his son into a closet unattended for more than 24
hours, Bragg later discovered the young child dead with a broken
collarbone and punctured heart.

Faced with the possibility of life in prison, and the belief that the
boys death was an unintentional result by the bothered father, Bragg's
lawyers convinced him to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter
which carries a 15 year sentence, and five years parole.
