In EQ, downtime is a major factor, you need to pull mobs that are at a 
level that you can handle without a significant net loss in mana/hp over 
time, and keep doing that nonstop to maximize xp.  There are other 
methods, such as AoE groups, where you do things with planned downtime, 
but for a run of the mill xp group, the desired outcome is as stated.  In 
EQ2, where downtime is trivial anyway, you can go after the much harder 
mobs that you can take down while expending most of the power of all 
group members, and be ready to take on the next one quite quickly.
