Oh I agree 100%. But I did specifically say 'a raid guild' not 'members 
of a raid guild'. I can't seriously imagine a the raid leaders of a 
serious raid guild deciding to go and take up raid nights from engaging 
new content to go and farm old zones for some tribute items. I just 
don't see any guild going for that, as a guild.
