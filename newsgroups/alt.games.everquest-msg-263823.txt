For me, the death of dedicated crafting in EQ1 started with the Shawl and
Ring quests, where in order to advance you had to drive several tradeskills
up.  The result was a huge number of people who, in order to do those
quests, had to also become master tradesmen in not one but several
tradeskills.  Prior to that, there were relatively few actual dedicated
tradeskillers.  It was finished when the Bazaar arrived.

Once the huge numbers of them showed up, and the Bazaar showed up, the idea
of paying more than 1 plat over construction cost disappeared.  I actually
had people later on telling me that I should sell my armour at a loss
because after all (according to them), I was only making it to skill up, and
I should be grateful to them for buying it at all and cutting my expense
loss.
