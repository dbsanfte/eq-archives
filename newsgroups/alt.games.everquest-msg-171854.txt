I wouldn't worry about ruining the game with 166pp.  166k pp might do that,
but 166 will, at best, get you some better-than-average gear.  Anyway, I
wouldn't think you'd have to lose the RP aspect by twinking your character.
I mean, it's a longstanding tradition in a number of fantasy books to give
some guy who doesn't know how to fight a magical weapon so he can kick ass.
Read about Rand in the Wheel of Time series.  Hell, that guy was twinked.  I
mean, he might have made a good ranger with his archery and tracking skills
and all, but when he tried to make it as a warrior, he'd have been toast if
he hadn't had his dad's badass sword.
