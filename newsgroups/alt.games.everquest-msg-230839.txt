The sperms aren't on faction I don't think.

The dragon in WW is Esorpa of the Ring. Those in Kunark on RoS faction
are Gorenaire in DL, Severilous in EJ, and Talendor in Skyfire, along
with all the dragons in VP (and Garudon in Veksar? I don't remember).
There's a couple others scattered around the game as well.
