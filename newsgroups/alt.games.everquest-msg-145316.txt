As always there is a right and wrong way to do things, 60 chanters
make a LOT of money off this spell and good thing cause this spell
aint cheap. I always offer 100p for it and consider it a bargin as my
kill rate skyrockets as does the loot. The xp of couse is the real
prize. 

Example : My 50+ Monk w/Shammy buffs(Yes I pay well)  with my wifes
50+ Druid w/ KEI can clear the spirocs. I mean every bird dead as a
doornail. She kites 6 or 7 while I just work my way up the house,
staying in xp range is our only real problem.Takes a while yes and
rarely get the place to ourselves but still thats an impressive
increase in kill rate dont you think? 
Worth 100p ? AYE!  Addicted ? NO. Very useful tool ? VERY! Just make
sure you got the mobs to support it cause cheap it aint. 

BE NICE TO YOUR CHANTER AND YOUR SHAMMY! 
Heck be nice to everyone ;)
