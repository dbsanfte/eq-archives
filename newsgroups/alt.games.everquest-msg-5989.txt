Not sure about the difference between specific weapons and individual player
stats, but the difference was huge when I finally got to experience it.  All the
way through 19, with my two handed weapon, (Crystallized 2H Sword, 24/48) I
seemed to be doing a max of 29, with the occasional critical hit in the 50's.
As soon as I dinged 20 I started doing some normal hits in the 50's, (40's more
common) and I've had a crit as high as 97.  Quite the shocking and pleasantly
surprising difference.
   The difference on my dual weilded langesax was far less noticeable, as I
think I was already doing nearly the maximum damage they were capable of prior
to making lvl 20.
