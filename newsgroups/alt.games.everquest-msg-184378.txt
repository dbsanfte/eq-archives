Well, it's the only documented suicide related to the game(as loosely as I
believe it is related). There are other stories...the one about the fella
who squeezed his child(resulting in his death, eventually) and shut him in a
closet because playing EQ was more important than being a father to him.

But I digress.

Not anymore than labels on records stop them from record companies from
being sued, and not anymore than raising the drinking age stops teens from
drinking. It actually tends to have the opposite effect.

I doubt it's *addictive*  in the medical sense, but it can certainly be
*obsessive*  in the psychological sense.

I think in the end it's a matter of priorities. From my own experience, I've
been playing since the day EQ was originally released, and have played every
class except Magician and Beastlord up to at least level 10.

But, I can honestly say that I have never missed a day of work for the
purpose of spending it on EQ, and my highest level character in 4 years of
play is a 44 Necro.

There was a time a couple of years ago when I did very little except go to
work 5 days a week, then come home and play EQ, and do it all again the next
day. Weekends were spent in-game without fail. Then again, I was a single
man and had no outside committments to speak of. I don't see that as
obsessive at all; EQ was simply how I wanted to spend my free time at that
point.

This past year, I became a husband and a father, and my priorities changed
accordingly. I get 1, and rarely, 2 days a week that I can more or less play
at will. Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't. In the end, it's all about
setting priorities and sticking to them, I think.

I would say that if aspects of the game are causing depression on your end,
then there is certainly a problem, if not a huge one. Set priorities, my
friend, Norrath isn't going anywhere.;)
