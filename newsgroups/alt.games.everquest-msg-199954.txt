Gnolls at the spires in SK are easy to quad at 29 for wizards
even without KEI.   It's also a big, flat area with few adds
possible.  Ideal learning ground, IMO.   That's even more
true because you can get pairs easily and kill both using
root/nuke if the "quad" goes bad.  But one can get four at a
time as well.
