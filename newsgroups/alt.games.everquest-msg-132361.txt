   I've noticed that some people forget clerics deserve a share of the loot, even
people who should know betters like, as a guildee you group with often.  I get vocal
about this in group.  The other day, I tried to actively loot 3 or 4 times after a
fight.  Of course, I have to stand up to do so, which puts me at a disadvantage out
of the starting gate.  I asked "Does anyone mind if I loot something from time to
time?"  Their was a round chorus of "Of course not!  Go ahead!"  The next fight, I
again tried, and got the "this corpse is already being looted" message each time. 
"Sorry, guy, but I'm sitting so not as fast to reach a body.  I understand.  I'll
just go solo something so that I can make some coin.  Good hunting to you all."  I
then immediately got 4 tells, and things changed.
   Clerics shouldn't sit silently and fume about unfair treatment in a group.  They
are valuable, and if you're in a group that can't, or won't see that, then it
shouldn't be hard to find a group that does.
