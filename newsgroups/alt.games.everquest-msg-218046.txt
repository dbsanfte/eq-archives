Yes, but the question isn't "can they kill mob X" its "can they
get more exp per hour for each member than they would soloing?"

Since the best exp a bard can get comes from swarm kiting, which
relies on having many mobs kill one mob for you, I'd have to say
no.  A second bard isn't going to contribute nearly as much to
this style of kill as the first bard, and the second bard could
be swarm kiting on his own instead.  I think the loss of the
second swarm kite would add up to far more than the 20% bonus the
first bard will get on his swarming.

If the bards are using chant kiting to solo instead, then they
still won't stack, since bard DOTs don't stack with identical
DOTs from other bards.  There are only 5 DOTs, and even the worst
bard can sing 3, meaning the second bard will only have two to
sing and the far less effective bellow; but good bard can sing
all 5 DOTs, which leaves the second bard chain bellowing.  If he
was killing his own mob he'd be chanting away, so much better
off.  Still, the loss of efficiency might be made up for in the
20% bonus.

Standard (non swarm) charm killing the duo would certainly be
better off, with two pets on a single target, and the second pet
benefitting from position to get an extra 15% DPS

Bard Melee plan wouldn't benefit as much, since the two heal
songs won't stack and the mana songs are worthless to bards; its
easy enough for one bard to handle slow/snare, self haste, and
healsong, leaving the second bard only self haste, stacky haste,
and relatively worthless songs like runesong to sing.  Bard Melee
plans sucks anyway.

Bard Fear Kite would be better off, as juggling snare and fear
and keeping both on the mob reliably can be irritating if there
are any resists involved; duplication of efforts here wouldn't be
wasted; both bards sing snare fear self haste and probably cycle
in a DOT or two since they won't have to worry about making sure
of overlap, provided they sing in a "round" (like Row Row Row
your boat; one starts snare fear haste dot and the second starts
his snare fear haste dot cycle at the point where the first sings
haste)

Then there's "combined arms" plans, where one uses one kill
method and the other uses a different one.  Hate kite via dot
with pet while second bard uses melee and pet... lots of other
combinations.  

Only reason I say two bards are worse together than seperately is
that I've yet to see a plan that comes close to swarm kiting, and
with that one plan, two bards are worse together than seperately.
