Not saying this is the best idea, but this is what I did...  First off,
you've done good by becomming a Cleric's pet.  I'm a Druid's pet myself...
hehe

At level 14 I believe that my Druid friend and I were camping Elite Ledge in
Blackburrow for a time.  I also had the fortune to have someone in my Guild
sell me a Velium Blade at a ridiculously low price so I had a magic weapon.
I took to going to 'wisp isle' with a small group of friends and also
killing Scarecrows with a group in WK.

I also did extensive hunting in Everfrost.  You can group mammoth calves and
get very good xp.  The key here is to go to the edge of the frost near Bandl
and your puller, I assume that would be you since you have track, will go
out a little ways and pull back to that area.  This way, IF you get in
trouble, you can run like the wind to Bandl.

My Druid friend has levelled faster than myself and is now lvl 29 while I am
almost 24.  I am currently camping (And by that I mean logging off/logging
on outside of Split Paw in South Karana.  Good xp and good loot but ONLY in
a group.  hehe  No soloing Split Paw yet.  I can also solo white Mammoths in
EF now and the tusks sell for quite a few plat in Halas.

Good Luck Fellow Ranger!
