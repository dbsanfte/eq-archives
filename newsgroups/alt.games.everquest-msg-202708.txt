No, afaik it is only on 52+ (or 51..please correct me if wrong) spells where
the level limits start and Boon of Garou also had a limit but that was just
been removed.
Anyone 43 or over can receive level 52+ spells and I think it's a 46 limit
on 60+ spells...at least I am certain Aego is 46 limited.
Below 52 pretty much all spells stick on any level it's only the ones at
that level and above have limits on the recipient.

Boon of Garou is the only spell I know for certain had a level limit on it
and was lower than 52 but I seem to remember something similar on Rune
IV...Are or were there any others?
