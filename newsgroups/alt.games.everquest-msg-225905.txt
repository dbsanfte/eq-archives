This morning I made the mistake of having vegemite and tomato on toast for
breakfast after a night on Corona beer. I just hope I didn't need my kidneys
as I am sure I spotted at least one of them being projectiled out just a
short time thereafter. Having said that, the new contents of this rather
unfortunate waste paper bin would proberly <also> be a far superior
newsreader than Outlook Express...

: )

...but for some reason still find myself using OE, I think it is just
laziness, OE is already installed and it takes only seconds to setup. Of
course it could be the result of some devious mind control experiment in
Bill Gates quest to control the world as well.... (which may also explain
the box of "Catcher in the Rye" paperbacks under my bed as well).
