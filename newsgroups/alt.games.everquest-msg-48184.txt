They can, in fact. I do, in preference to Ro, for several reasons.
That said, I still have a pair of Ro gauntlets to trade out when using
a weapon with a proc (giving up the Strength buff on the Ry'gorr
gloves for the very nice Dexterity buff on the gloves).

It is.

Or go to Runnyeye and get some Blackened Alloy stuff for free
(assuming you can get any of the goblins away from the farmers) and
keep your plat for Ry'gorr. Take friends (an enchanter is pretty much
a requirement - pulling 20 green agro mobs to the entrance is
embarassing). Almost all the goblins on the bottom floor can drop
armor pieces, and any extra pieces you pick up will help fund your
future Ry'gorr purchases. There's even a banker in the zone to store
your old armor.
