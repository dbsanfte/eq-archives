Ya, the Luclin zone stutter is a pita.  Also seen it happen due to
packet loss:  druid never got the "you are about to fall messages"
while climbing the NK spires to get high, then apperrently got hit
by a big packet loss (aka lag spike) just as Lev wore off, lag spike
passed and she was street pizza.
