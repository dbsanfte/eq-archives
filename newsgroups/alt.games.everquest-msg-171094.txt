Well, the Amish also don't think their mayor is the annoited one, either.
^__^

None the less, what happened in Waco should have had Janet Reno on trial for
mass-murder.  Especially since, one by one the charges against David Koresh
proved to be nothing but lies (remember the line where said that he got a
ten (I think that was the age) year old girl pregnant, and that he was God?
As it turned out, the said that if he got a ten-year-old girl pregnant, he
must be God... small edit, and the meaning is entirely changed).

I'd have to find the specific case, but there's an issue now where a school
will not allow a christmas scene, but they will allow a minora (I know I'm
spelling it wrong) and the shriner's symbol (which applies to only one small
sect of Islam, and has nothing to do with the seasonal holidays, but is
allowed anyways).
