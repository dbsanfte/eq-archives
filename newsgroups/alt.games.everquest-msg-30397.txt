at 17 you can start questing for crafted.  Go to SK, people
are always shouting about aviak charms.  Aviak charm and I
think two star rubies will get you a piece of crafted
(Gauntlets IIRC).  As mentioned below, lose the weighted axe
get either the axe of the Iron back, or a Langseaxe of the
Wolves.  for 1hs langseaxes are very good and with a full
group you can probably do that quest as well.  you will want
to have a tracker along, makes things much easier.
