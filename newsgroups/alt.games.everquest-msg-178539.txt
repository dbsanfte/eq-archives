I've been having the same problem.  Not sure what's causing it but it is
very annoying.

> Help!  My trader crashes to desktop at random intervals since the latest
patch!  Havn't seen anything on CR or EQLive - the only reason why I don't
think it's just me is that a) it happens on 3 machines and never used to
happen on any of them, and b) some other people grumbling about it in the
Bazaar.  What's up with this?  It's very annoying, especially when /trader
mode is most convenient when you will NOT be there to reconnect in the event
of a crash to desktop.
