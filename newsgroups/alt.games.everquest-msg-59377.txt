Cause GMs get to have fun  =P

besides, they *could* give a PC the key, but they don't.

Also, GM transport abilities are limited to being able to /goto
player/corpse, /summon player and /zone to safe point in a zone AFAIK, but
they still get to run around with "Guide Journey" on, formerly Spirit of
Norrath (100% speed vs. 55% max on SoW, as per spdat parser) GM/guide
abilities discussed at
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003000.html

Also, there was originally a plan for a game wide firepot network, but that
never happened, but there is another locked pot in the chambers of Miragul
below Everfrost, also one in Neriak 3rd and Toxx, and actually, the Qeycat
pot goes to Toxx, and the Neriak pot goes to another pot in Lfay.
All this was discovered by people using the /zone hack that allowed you to
force GM /zone command on a non GM client, but only to "connected" zones,
and since /zone worked betweek Neriak 3rd and Lfay, and between Qeycat and
Toxx, those were considered connected by the firepots since it was the only
unknown factor.
All this is discussed at
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003081.html

Heh, blame me for having an RL friend who got expelled for hacking, he was
also the shortest lived guide ever, he got his acceptance e-mail, and then
another e-mail about 5 minutes later saying his account was banned (he
regularly used EQw and hex hacks, including /zone)  see him mention it at
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003293.html (Jackalo)

hmm... I probably know too much, I give about 10 minutes before the Verant
Goon Squad bursts in...

Oh, and just to clarify, I have nothing to do with any of these things, I
just use a search engine and have strange friends.
