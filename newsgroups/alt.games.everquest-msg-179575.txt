Yes, the Ring of Combine drops you in the Lost Valley.  Never seen a dragon
around, and pretty safe there.  When you run through the mountain, just
before you exit the tunnel, do your buffs.

It's almost a straight shot out of the tunnel mouth to run to the FV tunnel
on the other side of the zone.  I used to veer to the right of the Giant
Fort a bit, and would usually end up pretty close to the FV tunnel.  Just
watch out for them pesky Drachnids.

After you make it to the FV tunnel, zone and run straight through all the
way to exit in FV.  When you run out, FV is to the right.  You'll have to
swim across the lake, but no biggie as long as you're cammoed.   I've never
had the Drachnids in FV see through my cammo.

Be safe.
