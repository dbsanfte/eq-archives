Not quite.  Normal default run speed mod is 1.25.  Snow griffons, giants and
dragons (except in Kael and Skyshrie oddly, there it's 1.25) have run speed
mod of 1.50, as do all cat types.  Rygorr Avengers have a run speed mod of
1.75.  Generic undead have a run speed mod of 1.00, as do most beetle types.
Anything perma-rooted, such as THO, burrower beast, the Great Saprophyte
have run mods of zero.  Grimlings, Owlbears and Sonic Wolves are interesting
though, most are either 1.25 or 1.50 (about 50/50 split), a few nameds are
zero, and some are 1.75.  Only things I know of with mods over 2.0 are some
of the warrior type Dark Sendings in Grieg's End, clocking in at 2.25 (and
being immune to runspeed changes =X)

Anyways, I'm not sure what Grimfeather's mod is, but my guess is around
1.75.  Snow Griffons just seem comparably faster because they're rangers and
SoW themselves.
