The cheif rezzing cleric bound himself *at* the hand in spot (Duh...) and
the Handing in druid bound himself and a couple of others at some island in
Fay's path apparently. I made my own way to the cove and was bound on EC
tunnels at the time. I hade to bite by tongue to not tell them how stupid I
thought they were for *ever* binding in the same zone they were fighting
in... I think it was pretty obvious by the end of the night anyway.
