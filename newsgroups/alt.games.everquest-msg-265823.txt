No. It wouldn't amount to that.

A person can think another person doing X is unacceptable with out 
ostracizing them... whether its drinking Milk from the Carton or 
becoming a heroin junkie.

Although, if we accept homosexuality isn't a 'choice' for homosexuals, 
than beleiving they are practicing an unacceptable lifestyle is on par 
for stupid with thinking left handed people should just be right handed 
people... but having a stupid idea isn't the same ostracizing them.
