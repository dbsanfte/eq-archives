No doubt about it ... Xupiter's a pain in the ass.  Popups are one thing ..
hijacking my browser's home and search pages are another thing entirely.  I
hope they end up on the sharp end of a Grobb meat cleaver.

To go at it that way, be sure to go into the registry and remove the Xupiter
key, as well as the changes it made to your browser's search functionality.
