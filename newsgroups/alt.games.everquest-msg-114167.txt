Ok, now lets hear from the folks who either have no problems or less
problems over the last month.  Using posts as a gauge of connectivity
issues is generally gonna be biased since folks with out problems rarely
post just to say everything is going great.

btw, everything is going great for me.  Multiple PCs with different
hardware and OS logged in for hours on end usually.  I go LD more often
from dropping a keyboard off my lap than from anything else,  though
that sticky Ctrl key gets me sometimes as well.  That would lead me to
believe that the servers or VI's network are not causing LDs "more and
more" or I should be seeing the issue as well.  This is not to say that
it's not a client code issue  involving hardware interaction which might
cause problems for one class of users but not all others.

So just out of curiosity... who ISN'T having "more and more" LD issues
lately?
