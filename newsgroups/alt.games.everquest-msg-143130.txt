Blah. I switch chars too much to bother posting all the names :)  I have 
8 chars from Tarrew Marr that I never play anymore, and 5 on EMarr, 2 of 
which I play often, 2 seldom, and 1 rarely (mule).  Tomorrow I'll 
probably get sick of the necro and create another class *g*

What do you consider grilling?  I just say "hey, you, do I know you?" 
and if they answer, cool, if not, I kind of wonder what the heck they 
joined a chat channel for and go on with what I was doing.
