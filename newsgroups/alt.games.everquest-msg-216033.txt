Nope, I almost never work in windowed mode, occaisionally I will switch to
windowed, minimize, do some work, then come back to EQ and out of
windowed; I find it very irritating to actually play EQ in its windowed
mode, but its handy not to have to dump completely just to check email or
make a couple entries in a database.

However, I can say that most of the crashes I'm reporting are not the
result of having recently been in windowed mode; I don't do it often to
begin with (perhaps once every two or three sessions), and I'm crashing
out shortly after logging on most times, because I log on, decide I have
time for an LDoN run, go LFG, get invite, start moving, and crash crash
crash; about half the times I zone, I crash, and since it takes several
zones to get into an LDoN dungeon, thats when I see most of my crashes.

The times I do go to windowed are generally when I'm soloing, which means
I'm sitting in one place, I'm OOM and facing a long med time, and decide
to go check email; nobody in my group to amuse me, nothing I can do to be
productive anyway, just sitting.  After doing that I rarely zone, usually
stay right where I am, continuing to solo, until time to log out.

Splendid
