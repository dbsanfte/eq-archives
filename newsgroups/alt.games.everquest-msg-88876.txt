First point:  While it's certainly *possible* that a patch can nerf a
trade skill, it's pretty unlikely. What's more likely is that you hit an
unlucky streak. Having been through that myself, and recently watching
my friend go through about 1 KPP in supplies in smithing to see ONE
skill up as they appraoch 200, I'm not shocked at all. The higher the
skill, apparently the longer you can go. And they do come in streaks,
including LONG streaks with no improvements. Your report sounds just
like every person saying that the drop rate of "such and such" was
nerfed after the last patch because "they've never gone so long without
a drop", when in fact it's just the same and they just had a bad run.

Second point. You are certainly entitled under the PnP (i.e. "pissy
nasty player") rules to take any spiders you get the first aggro on.
However, if there are lowbies out there trying to hunt them and you are
just smoking them, rather than telling them to complain to Verant,
perhaps you should tell them to complain to your guild. And not
sarcastically either. That's pretty poor play, and a VERY lame excuse
for being a jerk to the low level players by taking all their kills
because "your tailoring needs are more important than their xp and
leveling needs."

If you are that uber you are likely rich enough (or have ready access to
fast plat), and there are lowbies trying to hunt them, perhaps you could
consider offering to buy the silks from the lowbies? Just a thought.

I realize that might sound negative, sorry. But it just takes me back to
my tailoring days when I was trying to mass accumulate silks. I was
doing it in the heart spider rooms in Upper Guk. When lowbies came in, I
let them hunt and ended up keeping them safe, and either buying (and in
some cases getting for free) all the silks anyway. Everyone went away
happy.
