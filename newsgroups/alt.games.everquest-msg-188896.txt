If you consider that the main function of the UN is to rubber-stamp 
whatever the US foreign policy of the month happens to be, you may well 
be right. Myself, I tend to think that what weakens the UN the most is 
its most powerful member entirely bypassing the Security Council 
whenever it suits them.

I don't think any right-thinking person has a problem with the USA 
playing the global cop where one is needed. I fully supported the 
intervention in Bosnia, and I was appalled at the EU's passivity in that 
conflict. I fully supported the war in Afghanistan, and I will fully 
support any action that I feel is justified, regardless of who plays cop. 
This war isn't a police action, though, it's a bare-faced oil grab. The 
reason I don't actually oppose it is that removing Saddam appears to be 
the only viable way for the UN to lift sanctions on Iraq, and finding a 
permanent solution to the situation in Kurdistan.

Well, of those three points only the first one is easily disproved. Fear 
of what, exactly? The French have a lot more to lose by pissing off the 
US than by anything Saddam could conceivably throw at them. 
Unenlightened self-interest? Well, this may well be so if we define 
"enlightened" as the self-interest of the Americans, and "unenlightened" 
as the self-interest of everybody else; I have pointed out elsewhere in 
this thread that I believe that both the French and American positions 
are defined by their current or prospective oil deals. Hypocrisy? 
Absolutely, but they are not alone, as the US's indifferent attitude 
towards the much greater danger posed by North Korea plainly 
demonstrates.
