Although I specifically am not play DAOC over EQ, it still decidedly has
advantages over EQ.

I've sited elsewhere why I prefer EQ over DAOC, so I won't go into that here
and now.  But after playing DAOC for quite some time and gaining a 12th
level wizard and 22nd Blademaster, I have learned first hand the experiences
that the current version had to offer.  5 currently come to mind several
advantages of DAOC over EQ in no particular order.

1)   ability to cycle thru targets with one key, instead of just being able
to target the nearest target with F8 in EQ.

2)  ability to cast more than 8 spells!!!  although the spells are not as
numerous, the ones you can cast don't have to be siphoned thru 8 spell
slots. ( please sign the petition to help change this for EQ)

3)  superior combat and visualized combat for tanks.  You can decide
different attacks that accomplish different things, making fighting a little
more tactical.

4) when logging on, you can log on decidedly faster, and also pick a char
right from the opening screen if the char is already created.

5) guild system is more advanced / customizable.  Each guild structure can
be unique, and titles and priviledges can vary greatly.  Appeared to have a
guild bank either in place or prepared to be in place in the future.  (For
instance you could have a slot for people wanting to be members who could
only hear guild talk, but couldn't talk in it. )
