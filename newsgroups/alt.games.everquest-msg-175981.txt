There are many /disc skills that warriors get post L50 that make them a
force to be recokened with!  We were designed to get aggro, and die as
needed, so we will not be able to out-damage other classes like Rogues, so
dismiss the notion of being the main damage dealer.  It's nice to deal
damage (cause that helps with agro) but you need to have weapons that proc
to generate spell like aggro.

You will find you can't solo like other classes, especially after L50, then
it comes down to gear and AA.

It's a tuff road ahead, but only gets better.
