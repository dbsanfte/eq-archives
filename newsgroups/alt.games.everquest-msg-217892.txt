     I wonder if he was looking for someone to "power level" rather
than someone to "level" his characters.  Perhaps I'm just nitpicking.

     Personally I like power leveled melees. They learn their job is
to attack the mob they are told to attack and to stay on that mob
until they or the mob dies.  They know to keep the healer alive and do
everything to keep aggro.  Casters on the other hand.....
