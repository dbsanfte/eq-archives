Looking around still for range items with procs, I found 
http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29245
but haven't seen one for sale.

Also this

In the first stage of Berserker epic, you get three throwing axes which 
have a proc (something that cures disease apparantly) when thrown.  Put 
in range or ammo slot with nothing else, and you throw them normally, 
using their 80 damage bonus and their stats, and they go away, proccing 
each time they are thrown.  BUT if you put them in range and a different 
axe in ammo, you use the ammo axes for all damage/delay/bonus, and use 
up ammo axes, while proccing off the throwing axes.

I tried this with a couple range slot throwables which don't stack, and 
have found that the trick does not work; you throw the ranged item.

I also found that you can put other stackable throwers in the range slot 
and still use ammo, and get the benefits of the range slot item if it 
has stats, been running around with razor claws or something like that 
which dropped in Echo and give me +5 str... sadly I threw the last one 
away accidentally, really have to make a point of monitoring your ammo 
to keep these, its sort of like keeping track and force feeding to avoid 
eating your 10lb hallas meat pies.

Anyway, my conclusion thus far is that for the trick to work I'll need 
to find something stackable that fits in the ammo slot.  Can't tell, 
based on the Allakhazam site, whether these bola's fit the bill.

A stun throw would be interesting, if it procs every time as the cure 
disease thing did; I can pump out axes at around 1 ever 2 seconds, which 
would be a tremendous amount of stunning

The explosive bola effect looks like a 20dd, which means small change, 
it would add a bit to my throwing damage but still wouldn't compete with 
double attack and frenzy... or at least I don't think it would.  Proc 
every time, I dunno, thats +10 DPS.

There's apparantly also a snare one, which wouldn't be particularly 
interesting to me as a berserk, but if the trick works it would mean 
monks could have an easily maintained supply of ranged snare (just make 
sure your stock of normal shiruken or whatever never runs out so you 
dont' throw the thing by accident.

The Allakhazam site is full of people gnashing their teeth because with 
the insane difficulty of collecting items to make these things, the fact 
that they are one use makes the, in the words of one poster, the 
equivalent of making Ornate armor No Rent.


If my little trick works, though, then the high effort/cost to make 
would be well worth it.

Then SOE will probably nerf the things.
