I think feudal government is what they were shooting for. The XP 
chaining feature of it however was too much of a PL tool for the vision 
to withstand the minmaxing.

I was only ever invited to join at the bottom of their little :) (And 
thus remained guildless through most of my AC1 adventures)

True, but Amway took the idea polished it, refined it, and turned it 
into a science. Amway is to pyramid businesses what Henry Ford is to 
assembly line production.

There was an open PvP server called Darktide, which is the one I played 
on, but the game, like EQ was really designed for PvE. Darktide like 
Rallos Zek had some serious issues. 

But, yes, guild politics at least were always "interesting".

Quite probably. You give someone an xp reward for doing nothing, and 
your just begging for them to exploit it.
