Sounds like the standard SOE approach to expansions: Include one or more
things so grossly unbalanced that lots of people will want to buy the
expansion to get in on the feeding frenzy.  Then after they've milked
the initial burst of sales, they nerf it a bunch.

Remember when Tribute got added and there were trivial items that were
worth enormous amounts of tribute?  Remember when GoD came out and you
could make a thousand plat an hour just by fishing in a safe zone?  (You
can still a thousand *tribute* in an hour, but not plat.)  I'm sure
there are examples from other expansions, but those are just the first
ones that came to mind for me.

I don't know if they do this deliberately to boost initial sales, or if
they're just being sloppy and relying on the player base to identify the
exploits after each release, but it's nothing new.
