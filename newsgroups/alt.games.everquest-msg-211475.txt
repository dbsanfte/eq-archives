The potion bags weigh 2.5 stone and hold small items like your food,
research components, malachite, cat eye agates and other gems.
I don't recall the weight of the deluxe tool kits (I think they weigh
3.5 stone) but they can store giant sized objects. 

Of course you can summon 100% wt reduction bags for hunting. When I
started, summoned items poofed as soon as you went LD. Now we get a
half hour grace period before they poof. Potion bags were to way to go
to avoid losing those hard won words and deluxe tool boxes for the "10
platinum to a vendor" mammoth tusks.
