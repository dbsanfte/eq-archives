You sound so certain...



Starting character - Gets Level 3 just by talking to a guy on Refugee Isle.
Start 25 characters in 3 months and you get 75 levels *just* by starting
them.

Starting character - Gets Level 3 in tradeskills by doing a single quest
that takes about 10 minutes.  Specifically, it puts you at 3 + 99%.  Do one
conversion of wood to lumber, you'll be Level 4.  So, use each of the above
25 characters for 10 to 15 minutes each, you'll get 100 tradeskill levels.

But hey, you've said that it's not possible, and I believe you, so you can
disregard the above information - it's obviously false.
