So, even knowing that the mob may be engaged without you knowing, you just
rush in?  What do you tell the guy you KS'ed?  "Sorry, I didn't see you", or
"Sorry, I didn't want to see you"?

Of course, there's also the fact that the mobs are swinging weapons or
clawing.  That tends to only happen when they're fighing.  Add to that, that
you can see the MOB's life bar when you target it.  The usually don't pop
with only half life.

There are other good clues.
