ROFL!  I honestly wonder whether the guy is really serious or this is some
elaborate hoax.

By the way, did you see his pictures? He looks like a cross between Barney
Fife and Charles Manson. And then there's his "Erotica" section where he
displays relatively modest pictures of himself nude. That's the part that
had me thinking it was a hoax. Is there anyone on earth that could be that
articulate and at the same time that stupid?
