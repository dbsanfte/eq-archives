Hi,

I have started an Erudite Enc of FV and I am having great trouble
getting any cash together. I am currently 5th level and have most of my
1st and 4th spells, but no cash and only my newbie robe and dagger.

Having searched Alakazams (SP) I can't see any useful low level quests
in the Toxx/Erudite areas. I also can't really find many mobs with
saleable or useable loot.

I'm thinking that I probably want to get a couple more levels then head
in to the warrens where I know that I can make good loot and do the
molar quest, not to mention the armour drops.

Any other ideas on how to get a set of silk-ish armour and all my spells
etc.

Cheers,

Jim
