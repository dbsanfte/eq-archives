sow and gate potions exist, my iksar monk usually has several in her Rallic
Pack, along with plenty of food and water. Looting only platinum and
high-value, low-weight items, also putting them into the pack and displacing
the low weight potions into main inventory keeps the weight down. Besides,
she's not my main, no amount of loot she can gather can equal a fraction of
my main's cash generating ability.

Eventually you can get a couple of Tinker Bags
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2366 and weight is not a
problem at all anymore, but at 5250pp each (best price) they are not exactly
newbie items. Being able to carry up to ten items/stacks of any size for a
total weight cost of 1.0 is simply invaluable to a monk, and certainly
useful to anyone, even an Ogre Warrior, to cut down on vendor/bank
excursions.
