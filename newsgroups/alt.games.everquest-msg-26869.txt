First, let me say that I'm a 30 lvl cleric and have enjoyed playing that
class.  I say this to let you know this isn't a shaman player simply trying
to kick dirt on cleric players.  Having said that...

I've been hunting the giants at the fort in Frontier Mountains for the last
several days now.  Hunting the elusive Forest Loops they drop.  Lately,
there I've found that shamans are better group healers than my cleric.
Here's the set-up.  We both have Greater Healing and high Wisdom.  There
we're equal, but shamans have pulled ahead by being able to regen themselves
and then cannibalize themselves for mana for more healing.  Interestingly, I
out nuke them with Wrath at 200 dam per cast.  So what I've been doing is
being a nuker and back-up healer in groups with shamans and them being the
primary healer.  Needless to say, this has made several laugh, but the
numbers seem to be there to support this strategy.  Also I've experience
constant action (a.k.a. fine killing machine) with shamans in groups without
the normal every third pull med break needed by my cleric when he's the
primary healer.  I nuke three to four times then let the warriors finish off
the mob, meditate up the mana for the pull following the next one, and
repeat.

Am I wrong in this assessment?

It is a tiny bit depressing to think that clerics are not the best healers
in the game anymore.  If I had known this, I would have started up a Human
shaman than a Halfling cleric.  In addition to being able to heal, I would
have gotten SoW, good combat buffs, and I think even teleporting.

Or is this situation simply at the level I'm at right now?  Or is it that my
group value is now changed to "simply" providing Revive and then later the
XP rezzes?
