Or as another idea, how about a warrior, being a melee specialist more
than anything else, is more skilled at making attacks that cant be
riposted? Still has the same basic effect of letting a warrior use the
dual weild fast attacking weapons that help him keep agro.

Actually, are you sure the changes he proposes would even affect the
casual knight? Casual players are already more limited in their ability
by the lack of ft15, mana conservation aa and focus items, and other
things that make a top end knight so efficient at this. I guess the
biggest fear knights should have is that SOE will decide it's a problem
and totally miss the mark fixing it, just like they did with monk's
tanking ability, which hit the casual monks much harder than the top end
guild monks.
