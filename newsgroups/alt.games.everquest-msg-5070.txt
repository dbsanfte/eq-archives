For a wood elf warrior, delete him and start over.
There's absolutely NO valid reason to start a woodelf warrior except
for some stupid vanity of having a "cool" looking warrior.

GFay is about the worst fucking newbie zone this side of pre-Paineel
Tox.

If you don't want a large/evil race, try a dorf.
If you don't mind night-blindness, try a barbarian.
If you don't mind the size and faction, try a troll/ogre warrior.

Personally, it's a toss up between barb/trol/ogre.  Slam is a great
skill becuase you'll most likely want to start out with a big damage
2HS weapon and later go to faster dual weilding 1HS weapons.  Neither
of which allows for bash but since large races can slam it's a great
way to reduce the mob's damage output and interrupting casters (not to
mention it's somewhat effective in stopping runners when the fuckwit
druid/ranger/necro/sk/wizard forgets to snare).

Get all primary melee stats over 75 (STR/AGI/DEX) and then dump the
rest of the points into STA.  It's real hard to screw up with one of
the larger races.
