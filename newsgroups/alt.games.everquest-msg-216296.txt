I don't really understand why EQ gives you extra stat points at
character creation time.  It's not enough points to make a really
customized character, and it's just enough points to screw
yourself if you make the wrong choice.  You'd think they'd lower
ALL the stats and give you a LOT more points to allocate, or not
allow you to customize your stats with extra points at all.
