Hmmm... well I'll assume this is mainly for higher level LDoN missions
then (mobs requiring consistent hitting from melees). I've used
knockback stuns every now and then to provide the extra seconds for
melee classes to not get hit (been doing up to lvl 55). None of them
have complained about it as far as I know since they can simply just
move to get back into melee range. Unless they do secretly hate me for
it, heh.
