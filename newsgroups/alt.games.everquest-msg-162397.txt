Really the whole concept of rangers root/soloing with bows is nonsense, at
least at level 52,  even at a master skill level, IMO.  The EXPENSE of trying
to solo with bow and arrow would far outweigh the loot.  Not to mention I can
easily go through stacks of arrows on a dark blue mob.  Where are we going to
carry all these arrows?  I honestly don't know HOW many arrows it would take if
I tried to KILL a mob that way because I always break down and attack.
Luckily I am able to get free arrows regularly from a mage friend, but those
aren't particularlly "good" arrows, (but they are free and I really, really
appreciate them very, very much!!!!).
It would be nice if some higher level rangers could jump in this discussion
because I would like to know HOW to make this a feasible hunting tactic.
