I created a new enchanter this week, and I was looking for some guidance.  He
is a level 3 gnome enchanter right now.  I created him an immediately went to
kelethin to start, so I can make some money on my loot :)  What I'm wondering
is this.  Is there any good enchanter strategy on the net?  How long can I solo
before I should start getting in groups?  Where is a good place to learn about
jewelcraft?  Any advice would be appreciated.
