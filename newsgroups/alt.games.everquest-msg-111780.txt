god, you guys still adding on to this thread? dont you people get it,
ever quest is frying your brains... did any of you ever read that
artical about that man who shot himself dead cause some dwarf or elf
made fun of him in the game? what a loser... you have to be crazy to
play this game anyways... sure i may of spent $10 on the game i
couldnt even fuccking play due to false advertisment but im glad im
with a better game that smokes this game and that needs no
introduction, ultima online is the game for me...at least they give
you a 30 day free trial... just type in the code and in a few houres
im online.. no credit card required...hassel free...im still not
making up my mind, ever quest will forever be a enemy of mine,
bastards...taking my money like that, shame on them, and for you guys
for supporting such a crappy service... all they want is your money,
they could care less about the people... at least ultima online doesnt
care if theres free ultima online shards out there on the web.... does
ever quest have this? nope.. didnt think so, they are just useing you
all.. time to rise up people..show your support, or your all gay...
the end!
