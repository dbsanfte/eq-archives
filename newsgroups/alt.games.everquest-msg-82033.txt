Then his education should tell him that the fetus is alive, and is
genetically a human being.  If he has reason to suggest that a fetus is not
human life, in contrast to these two facts, I'd like to see them.

Oh, and many M.D.'s consider a fetus to be human life.  I guess they're
wrong, since they disagree with you.

Then let's see the biology laid bare.  No more using degrees as an excuse to
mask opinion behind authority.

Prove that a fetus is not a live person.  Does the fact that they cannot be
seen make them less of a person?

No, the fetus is a person, in the embryonic stage.  A baby is a person, in
the infant stage.  A teenager is a person, in the adolescant stage.  The
only difference is how far along the stages are, and the fact the face of
the fetus is hidden.  We use that as a convienant excuse to deny that the're
really human.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
