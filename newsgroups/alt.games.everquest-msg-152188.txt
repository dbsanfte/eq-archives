Well, I understand that you are using FT as an equivalent quantifier,
but its an always on item based effect, so naturally it doesn't have
a cast cost.  All spell based mana regen effects have some sort
of cast cost, and for all but the very short duration ones, the cast
cost is negligible compared to the mana you will regen with them.

Take for example somethign that cost 1000 mana and gave you
a mana regen rate of one for an hour.  Well, an hour is 3600 seconds
so thats 360 mana back.  That would suck.  But if it cost 100 mana,
you'd be looking at more than 3 times the mana cost back that
it cost to set up.

POTC/POTG is a 6 mana per tic HP buff, the high end of
the druid HP buff line.  It doesn't stack with cleric HP buff
(just like the rest of the line) up to and including Aego, which
is no big deal, but it also conflicts with some classes self
only mana regen buffs, like cleric BAOR.  BAOR is the
same mana regen as POTC, but does stack with Aego,
so for a cleric, POTC means giving up all the HP and AC
of BAOR and having to use shorter duration buffs for
the same effect as Aego plus the mana regen.

For Mages, I  think, the same thing applies.  Other caster
classes seem to be better off with POTC plus Symbol
of Marzin.
