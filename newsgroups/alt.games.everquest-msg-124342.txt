We seem to have a disagreement about the meaning actually.  To me rogue
means essentially what I posted from the dictionary.  To you, obviously it
means something else.  Regardless of what the meaning of the word is, in EQ,
it is a class with specific abilities.  The class is awesome at damage
dealing, once the character is high enough level to come into it's own with
backstab.  At high levels, a rogue is the best sustained damage dealer in
the game, so long as the rogue is behind the mob.  At level 11, a rogue is
not really any different from most any other melee class.  At level 11, my
shaman was still primarily meleeing too.  At level 11 you cannot possibly
have any idea what the capabilities of a rogue are.  I do not play a rogue,
but I do play with them regularly, so I do have some kind of idea what I am
talking about.  At level 11, you should still be quite capable of soloing
dark blue mobs, although you have to learn which ones are "safe" to take on,
and which ones are not.  As you progress in levels, you will definitely find
that you absolutely have to group.  The rogue I play with most frequently is
level 52, and she does not even think about soloing, she just cannot.  If
you want to play a solo capable class, you will have to choose a different
class.  Many classes can solo, some much easier than others.  Some classes
can solo only with extreme difficulty, or only against specific types of
mobs.  The thing is, you should not get too wrapped up in what you think
rogue means, it does not necessarily mean the same thing to everyone.
