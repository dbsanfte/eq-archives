I need your advice.

I am finally getting high enough in level to start thinking seriously about
finally getting my Jboots.  I have 4 or more guildies who I have helped with
their own long camps and would be willing to try and camp SRO with me for
the AC.  2 of them are druids, thank god!, and because of "need before
greed" would not be rolling for the AC ring.

Some of my questions...

1. What is the minimum group to camp the ac in sro.  I am a 40 rogue and
have access to a 35-36 (see other post) ranger or 35 SK, 32 druid, 41 druid,
36 cleric and maybe a 35 monk. I know 3 of us could kill the thing. But can
we kill it fast enough?

2. Can a group of myself and some of the above do enough damage fast enough
to overcome the level 50+ wizards and necros who will try and kill steal the
ac?

3. What is the minimum levels and requirements for the AC in OOT?

Thanks,
