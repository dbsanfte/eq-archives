No, it NEVER overrides yours.

Spell haste from item is entirely different from spell haste from buff. 
  You can have neither, one, the other, or both.  The only stacking 
issue is that a larger spell haste buff will overwrite a smaller one, 
but as they all have the same effect, that doesn't matter either.

Interestingly, while spell haste items don't stack with each other, in 
terms of giving you additional reduction in cast time, they do work 
simultaneously.  This is visible when, for instance, you wear a spell 
haste I and spell haste II item; if you look at a spell under level 20 
which takes less than 2.0 cast time while naked, it will still take the 
same time with the spell haste II item on, but with the spell haste I 
item on it will take less.  Put both spell haste items on and you still 
get the reduction.  Meanwhile, a level 40 spell which takes 2.0 to cast 
will not benefit from the spell haste I item, but will from the spell 
haste II item, even if you are also wearin a spell haste I item.  This 
is because Spell Haste I works on shorter duration spells than spell 
haste II, but has a max level of spell it will affect.

Similarly, specialized spell haste items that affect only beneficial 
spells will work in preference to more generic ones, and so on.

Spell haste from a buff doesn't have this variability; it reduces only 
spells of a minimum duration (3.0 I think?  Its been a while) and 
affects all spells up to its maximum level the same way.

Unless you are pressed for buff space, its hard to imagine a caster or 
hybrid who won't benefit from buffing spell haste (OK, a cleric who 
never casts anything but CHeal, which happens to be immune)
