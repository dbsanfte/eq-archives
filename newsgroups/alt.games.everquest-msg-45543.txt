What you should do is make leather padding. What you do is make two
spiderling silk into a thread, then combine that with a low quality
hide. Save all high quality bear hides to sell to tailors for at least
30 plat plus. The other ones, get a smithing knife:

www.eqtraders.com

Starting as a newb on a new server I made one by level one with just 5
points in smithing on the third attempt, so making this in halas
yourself should not be hard. Then you take the smithing knife and
reduce all high or medium quality hides to low (knife and hide in kit,
combine makes next lower hide) Once you have the low qual hides,
combine one at a time with a silk thread = leather padding.

Leather padding stacks! So no more storing hides in the bank.. you can
make padding on the run and everfrost is a GREAT area to do this when
bored since so many spiderling thingies and so many cubs and what not.


> I want the most profit available here.

Leather padding goes from about 80 plat a STACK up. A stack is 20, but
just running around you could really pump them out. As a matter of
courtesy though don't kill all the cubs that newbs are trying to kill.

You will make FAR more making leather padding and stacking it than you
would selling the hides to someone who wants to make leather padding.

Cyndl takes the non ruined (white regular) polar bear skin. This gives
you a use for those while running around killing for making leather
padding.


Bandit sashes go to the pally guild in Qeynos right? I don't remember
which factions they raise except qeynos pally guild and cleric guild.

(oh these factions)
Guards of Qeynos
Knights of Thunder
Priests of Life


You can also use the bone chips in a quest at the pally guild where he
gives you a box and this raises several factions.

Guards of Qeynos
Knights of Thunder
Priests of Life

So high that it won't be worth it really anymore. Your solo days are
semi over, especially as a barbarian unless you have some good regen
gear, you'd basically kill one mamoth when it was low blue then sit
for eons. Warrior becomes a very poor solo character in average gear
around level 25 - 30 but you also become about the best group tank
then. Get with even one shaman or druid around your level (druid
especially, with animal fear ;) ) and you are good to go. I'd say
cleric except you won't probably find many clerics that low looking
for a group in that area (while shamans live there like you.. and
druids get around)
