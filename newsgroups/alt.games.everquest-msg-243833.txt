Ok, still a little confused.  I've got the triangular stone for moving from
magus to magus.  I understand now that 10 wins = upgrade (which you get by
talking to the special npc at each camp and getting "new information,
right?).  Does the stone turn into a charm slot item after the first
upgrade?  And do I really have to get 50 wins just to get +1 to all stats
and resists.

I'm working on resist gear and this seemed a semi-easy way to get +10 across
the board but now it sounds like more work than I thought.

Thanks for the info.
