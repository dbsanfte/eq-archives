** Melee Changes Update **

-The Triple Attack skill has been removed from rangers.  After examining the 
effects of this skill during actual play, and then further discussion with 
both the development team and our player base, it became clear that triple 
attack was not a necessary upgrade to the ranger class.  Rangers in their 
current form do damage appropriate to what we expect, and do not need 
additional upgrades to damage output.

We'll keep you updated on any further adjustment to these melee changes.
