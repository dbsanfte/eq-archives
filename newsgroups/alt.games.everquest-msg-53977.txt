The 10/29 is likely a Black Alloy Longsword (not in copelands) the 7/28 no
idea but it hardly takes any effort to make them.

Level 28 warrior str set at 180 (not sure how high his str his but that
should cover it)

10/29 primary, 7/28 secondary  295dam/min
7/28 primary, 10/29 secondary  264 dam/min

The reason for this when everyone was so adament about faster weapon in
primary on the last thread, the one I was wrong in? The warrior in question
was in the low 50's with a much larger primary hand damage bonus than a 28th
level. Also the weapons aren't that close in ratio here with one have much
more damage but on 1/10th of a sec slower but before the 9/19 Lammy and
12/24 CSS were pretty close with 1/2 a sec of delay difference.
Put the Lammy and the CSS into copelands at 28th and the CSS in primary hand
is the better choice (by a gnats whisker) again, because his dam bonus is
that much lower.

CF
Even at 60th the 10/29 outperforms in the primary, it's dam/delay ratio is
that much better
