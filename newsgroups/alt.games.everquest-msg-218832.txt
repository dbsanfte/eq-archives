   Thanks Lance.  I'm just having a hard time wrapping my brain around
the concept that there are different degrees of "best".

   I think that chocolate is the best ice cream.  I love chocolate. 
Unless I am making rootbeer float, then vanilla is the best.  Or when I
can get some vanilla that has really big shards of broken chocolate in
it, then that is the best.  Or when my mom-in-law makes homemade
strawberry ice cream.  I rarely get that sadly, but when I do, it is
best by far.

  But usually, chocolate is best.
