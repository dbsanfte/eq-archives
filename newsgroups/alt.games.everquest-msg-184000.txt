Hmm. Why is it you feel that if the day is brigt and sunny and on a 
weekend, you must be outside or be a loser? Did this idea occur to you as 
you drove your Charlie Brown sweater clad butt down the road behind the 
wheel of your chopped SUV with the fatty tailpipe extension while smoking 
your yuppy fad cigar (well, faking smoking it) jamming to your Dave 
Matthews CD?

Seems to me that people get caught up in pop culture cliches and start 
looking down their noses at those who don't go along with them all the 
time. Do I ever go out on bright sunny days? Sometimes. Do I ever opt for 
the cave I call a basement regardless of the weather? Sometimes. Do I 
exercise? Sometimes. Do I veg on the couch with a bag of Cheetos? 
Sometimes.

Keep your self-riteous judgemental bullshit. You might want to reconsider 
all the things that might make up a loser. You may well be one for 
different reasons.
