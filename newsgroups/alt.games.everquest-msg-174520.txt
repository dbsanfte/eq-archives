No multiple people play my accounts... my girlf and rl friend has access to
1 account - my port bot, nobody can, or ever has logged on my main accounts.

Anyway 3 computers (soon to be 4 /hug company laptop), from, newest to
oldest they can run 2,2 and 4 characters each (windowed mode EQ).  I don't
like playing more than 3 at once tho, and 4 is my limit (you probably
wouldn't even know I was botting if i was running 3)..   spread across many
accts so I can rez myself.. port myself.. sc myself.. play with myself :)
