DX8.1 and latest video & sound drivers (installed AFTER the DX8.1 update)?

When you reinstalled did you save ANY files from a previous install (such as
opt or inis)?  If so, get rid of them, that might be causing it.

When you reinstalled (or installed SoL in the first place) did you make sure
you installed it into the same folder as the very first disk?  For some
lameassed reason the original EQ defaults to c:\program files\everquest but
SoL defaults to c:\program files\SONY\everquest and no, that's not "close
enough."
