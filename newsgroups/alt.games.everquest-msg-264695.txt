> I don't.  EQII just introduced a boat load of class defining spells

No, they announced the idea that new, class defining abilities and traits 
would be introduced as part of the design. None of these are in game now and 
there are no new "spells" that have been introduced. It's not clear to me 
when they're going to be introduced, or if they will be introduced before or 
after launch. Since they don't really start to affect anyone until sub-class 
range which is post 20, this theoretically gives them some additional time 
post launch to introduce the new content.

> and abilities and the zones still lag, a lot.

Yes, lag is still a problem in many areas. The two big hunting zones for 
each side, Antonica and The Commonlands, are the worst offenders for some, 
and for others (like myself) it's some of the city zones. I have mixed 
feelings about this. On the one hand I'm very encouraged by the progress 
that's been made recently. Last night in Antonica things were just fine, 
everything was working perfectly and there was no perceptible lag. It was 
amazing and glorious, running around and even flying the griffin flawlessly 
and with no perceptible lag. I figured there must not be more than 18-20 
people in the zone for it to be that solid, so I did a /who. "Results of 
your search were truncated at 100 users". Hmm, not bad. But then I zoned 
back into Qeynos and got hit with a case of severe framerate erectile 
dysfunction. This may be an nVidia related issue, but whatever the cause, 
it's an EQ2 issue and it had *better* improve by launch day or there will be 
hell to pay. Right now it is still unacceptable in many areas of town.

On the stability thing, I have a 2nd machine and account running 24/7 with 
my vendor sitting in her house selling stuff that my main has crafted or 
looted. This allows me to test the broker/vendor system extensively and I've 
been doing just that, filing bug reports daily as I log the various issues. 
The account had been going down whenever the servers went down and for the 
longest time I'd see my machine in the morning at the login screen and would 
report a handful of new bugs. Lately, it's been running around the clock for 
days at a time, and I haven't had any vendor related issues to report. She 
just sells stuff and feeds me cash to fund my ongoing crafting. Stable, but 
I still feel nervous and won't feel better until I've seen it go for a week 
or two without incident. At the very least, tho, it tells me that there 
aren't any major memory leaks or I'd be dying here.
