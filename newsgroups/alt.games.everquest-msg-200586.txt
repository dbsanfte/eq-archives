So, you play an enchanter?  I have a 37th one and have no real
problems getting groups.  I am no longer hounded for Clarity - I used
to get tells from people zones away crying for me to come and cast it
on them.

 players expecting others
> to have KEI and refusing to group them if they don't,

I suggested you do the opposite and refuse to group with those that
have it.
Since you know you will never get a group (or even 6 people) who will
play this way, your solution is to "fix" it.

Don't see how KEI would affect this one way or the other.  I met lots
of idiots pre KEI days.  Heck, I grouped with a BARD two days ago
(35th level bard).  All he did was play Warsong and tank - period.  No
twisting, no nothing.  We had no enchanter, got overpulls, did he
Charm or Mez - NO.  When we got a Shaman (who hasted us), did he
switch to a different song - NO.

Nerfing KEI will certainly make him a much better player!

 casters who cannot be bothered

This will always be the case whether you have KEI or not.  Until Sony
gives large bonuses to groups (thus encouraging grouping), it's not
gonna change.
My Shadowknight solo's well with KEI or without and makes more
experience solo than with a group usually.

 KEI has fucked

In Your Opinion. The opinion of the majority of the players is
otherwise.
