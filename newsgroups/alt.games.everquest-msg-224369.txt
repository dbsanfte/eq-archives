Another thing this pet does is run through it's mana pool very quickly.  You
do get a pet-only C2 spell called Kindle (11 mana/tick regen), but,
ironically,  you can't cast it until 54.  I've never used it in a group, but
when I've soloed with a Kindled 52 fire pet against the gnolls in
Jaggedpine, he blasts the first gnoll away in a flash, then is forced to
resort to his pathetic melee after that.  It's better to reclaim and recast
after every fight.  This pet is a nice idea, but I don't know how SOE could
make it smart enough not to be a problem in groups (without a boatload of
programming).

The Earth pets are my pet of choice for soloing post 50.  My usual routine
to cast pet, give it BO, sic it on the mob, then reclaim what's left after
the fight, then cast another.  A specialization in conjuration and
enshrouded veil, both of which lower the mana cost of a pet, help.  I've
found that reclaiming/recasting is more time efficient than our modest
heals.

You brought up pets and positioning on another thread.  I happened to
mention to one of my regular LDoN tanks that I had a pet that could
backstab.  After working a couple of rooms in the adventure, he tells me to
park the pet in the middle of the room.  I do so and he pulls every mob so
that it is perfectly positioned for my parked pet to begin immediately
attacking from the back.  He runs back to the room and turns so that he's
facing the pet with a little distance between them and bingo, the mob is
dished up ready for the backstab.  Talk about service (!), and even if you
have a tank who isn't diligent about mob positioning, parking the pet in the
right place might take care of the problem on most pulls.  The amount of the
backstab will be all over the place, but it is an extra attack (I think they
sometimes even get an extra attack from a "frontstab", not sure).  If you
have a chance to use it, I would log the session and check the log to see
how many times the pet backstabbed.  You might be surprised by the number of
backstabs even when the tank is doing zip to position the mob.

Generally, this is my LDoN pet even with the water pet's backstab.  Nothing
wacky, just a good tank with a nice stun that can sometimes be a timely
spell interrupter.  If the crap hits the fan and for some reason my pet has
to tank, this guy does much better than the water pet.

Here's a link with partial info:

AFAIK, the 49 earth and 50 MSII have the same hps.
