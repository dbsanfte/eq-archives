Speaking of lots of snakes to kill....
I remember being a higher LV (think was about LV14) in the Qeynos newbie
area, begging, pleading, nearly harassing the newbies to give me their snake
skins for 5 silver each, later for 1 gold each, or 3 pp for a stack of 20 so
I could make bog juice.
Then last night I wish I had lots more snake skins.  Someone in N Ro was
frequently auctioning asking for 20 stacks that he'd buy at 10 PLATINUM
PIECES EACH! (5 GOLD PER SKIN?)
Wish I'd have been a porter class and high enough to make a quick run to
Qeynos or some place I knew for sure had some (Freeport merchants were out
at the moment).
