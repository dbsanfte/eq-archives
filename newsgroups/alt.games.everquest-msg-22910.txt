I don't know anything about your setup, but I don't know why it wouldn't
work.  The way the router works is it takes one IP for external use (to
the ISP) and hands out a bunch of IP's to the internal network.  So from
the ISP's perspective you only have one computer, although in reality
all computers on the internal network are sharing the IP.  But I'm just
a novice at this networking crap so I may be talkin out of my ass :)

All I know is, this thing solved a bunch of problems for me and allows
me to have as many 'puters running eq as I want on my internal network,
withought my ISP giving a rats ass.
