I do agree with you there but want to add a few things.
I do believe that EQ was and still is a success because of one thing.
And that is people meeting online and enjoying a fantasy world as a
group. The moment leveling is the only concern everquest becomes a
boring treadmill. And this is my major concern about LDoN. It encourages
the short pickup groups where everybody just comes together for a
trivial task for 90 minutes tops. Even though most of the missions are
trivial due to the time limit talk among the group is more or less not
existing. Just inc, add, mezz etc. You, I mean I, don't make friends in
that environment.
When I started I met a few people who were interested in travelling all
over norrath. We had our group and just tried things just for the fun of
it. Going deep into dungeons to see how far we would come and what we
would see. There has been a sense of wonder when entering Kaesora
experiencing great ruins below the earth for example. Sure we wiped alot
but some nasty corpse runs aside this didn't meant much to us.
A line from blade runner comes to mind 'I've seen things you people
wouldn't believe...'. This is what I loved in EQ.
Sadly this adventurous feeling is gone by now. Add the fact that most
truly awesome new places you can go at 65 are raiding targets. So you
either raid full time or do sit with friends around a camp fire and tell
stories. Doing mindless exp groups isn't my way of playing so I rarely
ever group now.
To make a long story short if EQ wouldn't so much encourage level and
loot but instead focus on interesting locations and stories it would
attract and hold far more players. Even if they have beaten the endgame.
