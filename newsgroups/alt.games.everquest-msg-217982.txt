Not that stats are extremely important, but, overall, they have the worst 
shaman stats of all the races, except maybe Frogs, not sure what their 
starting stats are.  Vah Shir don't get the bonus of regen or no stun 
from the front to make up for the stats.

All that being said, the stat differences will be overcome with 
equipment, and, are not so severe that it will really be an issue.  In 
the end, just choose the race you want to play.  It's all about having 
fun, not minmaxxing the game.
