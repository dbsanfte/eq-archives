That makes so much sense it never occured to me.

I don't see what's so bad about the comic, I mean, yeah, they do masturbate
a bit often, but I can't really blame them... well, except when they have a
ready and willing girl right there anyway, but that's just stupidity more
than anything.

Like why Mike and his sister watch each other, I mean, if it were me, I
wouldn't limit it to just watching.

But hey, I'm a pervert.
