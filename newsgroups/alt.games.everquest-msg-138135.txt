}Have you ever heard of Maslow's  hierarchy of
}needs(http://www.connect.net/georgen/maslow.htm)?

Nope, this is a new one on me.  Fascinating. :)

}Essentially what Maslow's
}theory states that in order to engage in the free will choices you are
}referring to (i.e. to overcome one's genetic tendencies and do things for
}the good of all) one's basic needs must be met.  These needs include having
}enough food to eat, a shelter in which to live, feeling loved, having sexual
}needs met, feeling a certain level of self-esteem.

Hermm... This looks kinda weird to me.  I have an inherent bias against 
terms like 'self-actualization', I tend to classify them as 
'psychobabble', which I think basically means I have a really hard time 
figuring out what the heck they're supposed to mean. :) 

}I'm not intending to be
}bigoted, but if you do some research you will find that many (if not most or
}all) of those who use the "genetic predisposition excuse" haven't had these
}baser needs met.  According to Maslow this leaves them incapable of making
}the cognitive decision to move past these predispositions.

It souds a bit odd to me.  I'm looking at the pyramid thingy at the 
link here, I'm assuming most of what we're talking about is at the social 
and ego levels, and how they keep you from reaching the top of the 
pyramid?  Err.  How much of this theory has been tested?  It looks very 
philosopical, by which I mean they do a lot of theorizing and get away 
fromm an experimental base.  Is 'self-actualization' quantifiable in some 
way?

}Perhaps if prejudices and other such obstacles were removed (rather than
}utilized as a defense) the negative actions would also cease?

I'm a bit confused by what the 'negative actions' are? It seems clear in 
the substance abuse case TwoHead suggests, but going back to the original 
topic a bit, would that be like Mr. Wizzard's concern about PDA's in the 
workplace?  Or am I trying to apply it to something it doesn't apply to?

I guess mainly I'm not more than 50%ish clear how this applies, and 
secondarily, I wanna see the numbers that back it up.  Can ya help me?

Or maybe I'll be able to self-comprehend it after I satisfy my 
Biological/Physiological need for some sleep. :)
