I don't think there's a problem with any class asking for KEI... but at 
low levels (and I count the aforementioned 19 as low level), it's a wee 
ridiculous. When they finally get to a level for which KEI is intended, 
they will be screaming for even stronger drugs. It's like starting your 
drug habit on smack instead of pot.

In my opinion, even a 40 doesn't *need* it. But you know opinions are 
like assholes- everyone's got one, and not many other folks want to see 'em.
