There have been some doozies on this one, with what I think are varying
degrees of "how much of an exploit is it?" questions involved. The well
known one of the orcs in crushbone where you jump back and forth across
the river is borderline, but probably still an exploit. There was a REAL
fucked up one in PoG where a player found a spot where you could stand
and nuke a mob who was about twenty feet away, and keep hammering it
with nukes, and it would never come to you... just stood there turning
in circles. That one is fixed, though, I believe. ToFS first floor has a
weird one too in the entry that I won't give the details of, because I
think it's still buggy. But if you get caught at any of them, you're
likely to get your wee wee whacked.

I've done it with several of my characters, and will do so again until I
get a warning from a GM. My reasoning is that the "no exploit" rules
seem to deal exclusively with <gaining XP> from a problem in game
mechanics. Raising my swimming skill by swimming endlessly in a safe
area against an obstacle that I can't budge or swim over/around isn't
doing that. If that's an exploit, then casters who max out their casting
skills in safe area casting on themselves are exploiting too.  Not all
skills are raised in battle.

Ah, the Pulp Fiction approach to EQ. ;-)  I have to agree.

Be careful to include that tiny, but oh so important, caveat that VI
throws in on the end of the definitions where it deals with KSing and
contested spawns. 
Taken from 1.1 section 3 of:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp

"Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more
characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of
completing that goal."

The last seven words are the key. Too often you see guilds trying to
pull crap like stationing a monk (of course... best class for this ploy)
out where Lodazil spawns, then when he does, whacking him once and
FD'ing, then LOUDLY proclaiming to the whole zone that the mob is
"engaged" and any attempt to take it will be petitioned for KSing.  It
won't sell well to a guild who's there FiF and ready to rock while the
monk's guild is still scrambling for ports, but they still seem to try
it. Already saw a guide shoot that lame ass argument out of the water,
though, thankfully.
