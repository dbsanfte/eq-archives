It sounds like you had a lower level group... so a "level 50 average"
dungeon.

At 55, the level of your targets begins making a much larger difference in
how much experience they are worth.

From my own experiences at that level, a full adventure in a "level 50
average" dungeon would get me a blue and a half real experience.  A "level
55 average" dungeon would give about 2 to 2 and a half blues.   A "level 60
average" dungeon was giving about 3  blues (IIRC, didn't do many, and they
usually weren't stellar groups mowing down every mob.)

If it makes you feel better.

Numericly, you're getting the exact same number of experience points whether
you're putting them into regular experience or AA.
