    DI is used as spike protection, so against mobs with severe damage
spikes it's not unusual to see behaviour like that. Last night we did
General Reparm in Fire with low numbers (4 clerics, 2 warriors). He triples
for up to 3 K and has a 3 K proc. If he double procs, as he likes to do,
then Spellshield or not that tank is going down for the dirt nap without DI.
