Good questions to ask James, which is one of the first things I asked
myself. One thing that *did* change is that RAkyn got Ferine Avatar
finally. (My weapon hasn't changed...I'm still using that 41/31 2hb.) I
theorized that maybe FA enabled me to hit more often, and I was getting
more ripostes...but I'd *think* that would be compensated for by my higher
DPS finishing the fight off faster.

I'll go with the theory that the other James posted...maybe that camp has
just been made tougher.  I definitely don't want to go back there anymore
until I've plumped myself up with more defensive AAs.  Not that I'm afraid
of dieing (those two near-death experiences were quite a hoot...did I
mention how lovely weaponshield is when you are at 5% health and your
healer has just been feared?), I just feel bad seeing the healer sweating
bullets to keep me going.  He's had so much fun since he got that ornate
scepter with the Anger of E'ci focus effect...he's nuking for over 1100 at
times. I hate to make him revert to "heal me b*tch!" status again. :(
