Personally I think they are bound by the law to apprehend criminals.  But
besides this, it is no small secret that the guards themselves are into the
smuggling business.  Just read the story of Firiona Vie at the Harpy's Head
Tavern.  And then of course, turning goblin ears into the Highpass captain
is one of the most highly sought after ways of raising faction with the FP
militia.

I personally would like to see at least one of the cities 'cleansed'.  But I
suppose when you think of medieval times corruption was quite rampant.  Of
course, in Qeynos the distinction is not so blatant as Freeport, where its
the Knights of Truth in NFP against the FP Militia in E&WFP.  In Qeynos none
of the good guards knows who the evil guards are, in fact nearly all have no
idea there are evil guards!  So if you attack an evil guard good guards will
help him :-).

Hehe, the Crushbone Orcs have certainly felt my wrath, so much so they
cannot hate me any more than they do :-).

Once you get to about lvl 32 or 33, hit Lower Guk.  Exp is great, loot is
great, and unlike the dreadlands etc. you get to learn some dungeon tactics
that come in useful later on.  At 40 I am still in Lguk.  And of course, why
be bashin' up drolvargs and drachnids when ya can be throwing some undead
froggies around :-).  Being a Pally tho, undead is my forte.
