Not much, you have to have a player who has luclin and 
can stand the graphical lag of 300 bodies in the bazaar zone.
That cuts it down a tad. Besides that, the auction channel 
already kind of brought down EC traffic.


>2) Will it seriously and/or adversely affect pricing

Prices will plummet, on all but the most rare of items.
Unless a player is stupid they won't buy your centi LS for
2200 when 9 other people have lower prices all the way down
to 500 plat. But something will happen also making people more money,
there will be more browsing /shopping because people can take their
time rather than hanging in EC listening to spam. 

The EC system sucked ass on my server. It consisted of "CENTI LS,
PST." That is not the way to sell stuff because it means people have
to play a dumb ass game of "guess the price" with you. I don't even
bother with that crap on EITHER end. So the bazaar is the way that
I've ALWAYS sold; see the stats on the item and see the price they
want.

I think it will REALLY help tradeskillers. I saw one enchanted dwarf
bp, at a reasonable price of 1300 I think (not the new uber ones.. the
older 30 ac one with stamina.. still nice) For a dwarf its a bit like
a poor man's barbed ringmail with a nice plate graphic. I found it
with /bazaar then searching for "breastplate."
