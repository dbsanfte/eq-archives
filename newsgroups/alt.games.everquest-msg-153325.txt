Bah -- information on paper can get obsolete quickly.

*Real* tradeskillers use a program which can download an
entire website to a local hard disk automatically within
a minute or so, and make sure they've always got a relatively
recent copy of eqtraders.com handy (and a spare computer to
access it with).

I started doing this the first time I experienced
eqtraders.com withdrawal.  /shudder.  Never again.
