I am guessing here that you are talking about suicide bombers and more
particularly, those responsible for the tragic events of 9/11.  If am wrong
please correct me.  I just want to clarify that Islam does not in any way
exalt or condone these acts.  Their particular radical offshoot of the
religion may do so, but then, there are radical offshoots of a wide variety
of religions that teach all sorts of interesting ideas.  I say this as
someone who lived for 6 years of his life as a potential target of said
terrorists in Israel.  I have a number of muslim friends who are just as
horrified, if not more so, as anyone else.  Likely more so, as it is their
religion that these terrorists are attempting to use as an excuse for their
actions.
