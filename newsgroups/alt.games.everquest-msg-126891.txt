    Sigh, it's not just a problem for newbies. The level buff doesn't wear
off for ten hours, and the newly-buffed mob now has the aggro properties and
intrinsics of a level 47. If I charm and buff a plains cat in EC with VoG,
Feedback, and various other ENC tricks, you end up with a nasty plains cat
that will still be flattened by anyone to whom the cat is green, and which
ceases to be a problem within the hour. I do this with a BST, we have a mob
that can flatten a LOT of people, which will be around for ten hours.

    One change. ONE. Make the level buffs and charm buffs (charm leaves a
buff icon) not stack. Then a BST cannot both charm a mob and spontaneously
change its level.

    And changing levels can go both ways. I wonder if a BST with Puppet
Strings could charm something worthwhile to kill, then use a low-level level
buff to make the mob trivial?
