What's the relevance of that?   I'm unaware of any innate racial
advantages that would make any difference by the time you
start talking about group composition.

A warrior that can't be stunned from the front might be a better
choice as main tank, even with lower AC.   A monk with racial regen
might be a better choice as a puller.   But why would race make a
difference for a cleric?
