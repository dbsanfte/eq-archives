/boggle?   I bought the expansion... so people like me?

I understand what your going for, but eh... I don't agree... I do
understand epic items not being drop able... not some level 44 spell,
that I need to go to the same camp and complete numerous time to
purchase... hell Id give several K to buy the item, rather than loop
in a zone and force people to go where they don't want to go... 
As well, it is rather difficult for a necro to get a group (at least
in my experiences) course Id always invite one to mine.

see my point above...  I have no desire to farm anything... just want
my spell.
