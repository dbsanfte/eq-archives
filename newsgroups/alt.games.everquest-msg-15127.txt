There is, of course, a difference between "interfering" and "interacting."
Interacting is good most of the time. Interfering is bad most of the time.
There are exceptions to both.

Ahh, but your apples have little to do with the oranges in question.

Heals and buffs give people aid, and yes, sometimes unsolicited aid. What
they don't do if pull a mob out from under you and cease an activity you
were in the midst of. (One can argue that dying is an activity, of course
;-)  If I have chosen to fight mob X, your heal does not prevent me from
fighting mob X, for whatever reason I am doing so. Your killing the monster
from under me does.

I do not mind people stepping into my fights or offering their aid, but I
would like a "Need help?" first. Asking first is interaction; stepping right
in is interference.
