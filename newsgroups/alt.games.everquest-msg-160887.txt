Earring - 15% mana reduction on detrimental spells
Ring - 15% cast time reduction (except spells under 3 secs and Cheal)
Bracer - variable damage boost to DD's (0-20%)
Shawl - 15% increase in buff duration
Choker - a chance to not use a reagent on cast (I don't
use it, my only reagent consumption is malachite (cheap)
and pearls (not so often with the constant nerfing of 
CoH) 

Each level of focus is good on spells up to, but not
including the level you get the next spell - 

Choker at 4, 24 and 50 (good through 20, 49 and 60)
Mantle at 8, 29, 51    (good through 24, 50, 60)
Earring at 12, 34, 52  (good through 29, 51, 60)
Ring at 16, 39, 53     (good through 34, 52, 60)
Bracer at 20, 44, 54   (good through 39, 53, 60)
