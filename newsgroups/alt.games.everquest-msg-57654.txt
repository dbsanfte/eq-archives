  Patience is a requirement for customer service oriented jobs such as
GMing.  If you can't handle an occasional setback or frustration without
taking it on out players who haven't truly done anything wrong, you should
reconsider filling out an application to become a GM.

  I don't understand why these weddings need to have a GM presiding anyway.
From what I've seen and heard, it doesn't really add anything to the event.
If a wedding is supposed to be a "roleplay" event, what does it add to have
a completely OOC entity like a GM doing the ceremony (if that's what was
happening here?)  A player character cleric or other religious/official
figure (like maybe a guild leader or officer) would be much more appropriate
and more personal as well.  It just seems to be a waste of resources to get
GMs involved in these things.  The only reason I can see for having a GM
present is to make sure nobody actively attempts to disrupt the wedding out
of the blue... by training mobs to the ceremony, ect.  A guildwar, however,
is a consensual conflict and responsibility has to lie with the guild leader
who agreed to a war during the same span of time as a guild wedding had been
planned.  In my opinion, it's not fundamentally any different than if a
bunch of the guests at the wedding decided to start /duels with passerbys,
and then complained later about the fighting ruining the wedding.
