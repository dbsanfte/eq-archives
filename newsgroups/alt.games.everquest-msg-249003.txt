I object to triggered events not being reset after the triggering force
dies. There should be no 3 day wait for instance in air after a ring event
is failed for a trigger to respawn.

I have zero objections to anyone entering vex thall after killing the
emperor in ssra though. The mere fact that they can do it qualifies them in
my eyes. The rest is mere bullshit. Same with smith rondo and koadataz. Same
with tarkannon and veeshans peak.
