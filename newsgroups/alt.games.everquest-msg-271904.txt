As someone else pointed out, there are usually many ways to do
things (such as pulling), depending both on the skills available
to your class, and your own preferences, so that's getting a bit
deep for the FAQ.  Though I could see adding some class-by-class
introductory tactical notes as part of the "links to more info"
that I want to add to the FAQ in general.

But as far as understanding what terms mean, I've tried to get all
the common ones into the FAQ.  It's hard, because after a while the
terms are all commonplace to me (as they have been to others who've
maintained the FAQ) and it can be hard to remember that a term was
once a mystery to me, but I do try keep my eyes open for terms that
might not be clear to a newbie.  (E.g., I added "atm" = "at the
moment" to the jargon in the last update.)

In particular, though, the following terms were already in the FAQ's
glossary section: Kite, puller, temp, and sow.
