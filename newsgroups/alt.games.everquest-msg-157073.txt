Wrong again.

Here's an idea for you:  Maybe if you keep up on your homework and pick
your room once in a while mommy will buy you your nice Firiona doll for
Christmas.

SOE is in business.  Businesses exist to turn a profit.  When providing
an ongoing service, like EQ, the key to success is to deliver what your
customers want at a price they are willing to pay while making at least
enough profit to make it worthwhile from your ownership's perspective.
SOE is hitting that target dead on.  If they even attempted to satisfy
every desire of every customer (which is exactly what your indignant
whine implies they "should" be doing) they'd have never made it to the
original launch, let alone have the strongest performer in its class
even now over three years after launch.
