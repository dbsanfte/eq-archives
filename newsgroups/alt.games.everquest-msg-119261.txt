Right. The GM could have left well before Tunare "poofed"...

And what I'm saying is that the likelyhood that Tunare was nuked by a
GM to retaliate for something said in /gu (which, given what you
relayed, wasn't enough to piss any GM or Guide I've ever met off. By
the time they graduate from "apprentice" status - when they don't have
the power to insta-kill mobs -, they've learned to let snipes about
how non-helpful they are roll off their backs. Otherwise, they end up
quitting before that point) is about the same as Verant sending
mind-control rays through EQ to turn us all into psychopathic killing
machines IRL for their secret army to take over the world...

They would have had to have been a full GM, not a guide, and would
have had to have had sufficient motivation to bother opening the log
files and filtering through literally millions of lines to find a
single snip taken about how they weren't helpful. Like I said, full
guides are jaded to such snipes...GMs barely even notice them. Given
the crap they have to put up with every day, do you really think
something so trivial would cause them to do such a thing? Get over
yourself, you and your guild aren't that important in their lives for
them to give a flying rat's ass what you think about them.

Yes, I remember. I also remember that guy getting his ass thrown out
so fast he barely knew what hit him when someone finally /quit out and
went to chat to grab GM help from there, alerting them of the problem.
And the guy went on a rampage bragging about how he did it and such. I
don't see what this has to do with covering anything up, though. This
situation most certainly wasn't covered up. Exactly the opposite, in
fact...

( Besides, wasn't it a guide? So many people can't grasp the
difference, apparently... )

Bug or normal feature. Tunare isn't exactly a frequently-hunted spawn,
and I have heard of her being absent before. Did you witness her poof
or was she just not there when you arrived at her spot? And, as you
said, you'd been doing tedious zone-clearing for 11 hours. Had you
reason to pay attention to the /who lists? You did say you had no
reason to pay attention to whether the GM/guide was in the zone... Is
it possible even in the wildest stretch that a couple groups could
have slipped in and out while you were busy?

I repeat, your assumption is completely idiotic. It's also insanely
arrogant to think your little raid party was that important...
