Well, other than Hill Giants or Ice Giants, I'd be interested
in hearing where 1800 plat drops in a normal group.  (Six
people with a few (three minimum, two is a couple)
hundred plat is around 1800pp, right?)

Even a non-full group (1500? or 1200?) having that type of
plat drop would be nice.    So, other than Rathe Mts (HGs)
or Everfrost (IGs) where's this place?

Or did you mean "Ever get a split and see that the total looted
was a few hundred plat?"  If that's the case, yeah, most of the
time.  That usually barely covers my Symbol cost, though.  I
don't do pickup groups, though, so my Symbol cost is a lot
higher than it would be otherwise.   My guild tends to expect
clerics Symbol *everyone* for raids and that's filtered down to
normal XP groups as well.
