Druids and Wizards have spells that are called
"Targetted Area of Effect" spells.  You cast them
on a Mob (monster) and they hit that one, and up
to 3 more nearby.  Very near by.

In order to quad a Wiz/Dru snares 4 mobs, then runs
around in a circle a few times to get them really
bunched up.  He then runs out far enough ahead to
cast his Targetted AoE spell - casts it and hits
all 4, he then runs further, casts, and so on
until they die.

This works best with 4 mobs of nearly the same level
and hp.

These spells cost the same whether you hit 1 or 4
targets.  When you hit 4, their mana efficiency is
very good.
