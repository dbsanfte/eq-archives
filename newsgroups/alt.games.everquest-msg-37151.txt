It's not just the message that's annoying though, it also causes lag on your
end if someone inspects you over and over. I was in Karnors a few days ago
and there was a monk feigned at the live captain pull spot, he was getting
in the way and making it awkward for targetting and in the end we all walked
over to him and right clicked him like mad, he went LD after a few seconds
and we never saw him again.

I know it's a mean thing to do but the guy was afk there when we got there
and 5 hours later he still hadn't moved an inch and he was also making
pulling harder for the ranger because she kept running into him and almost
stopping.
