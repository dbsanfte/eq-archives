Being on the faydewar continent, I can't recommend this
quest more.  If you turn in 4 bone chips to one of the
dwarves in the Kaladim Paladin guild, you will get some
minor coin and minor items.  I even found that buying a
stack of bone chips for 2-3 platinum I would still come out
ahead, by selling whatever I didn't need to the nearby
merchants.  You will get weapons, shields, small patchwork,
lanterns, etc.  If I start a character on that continent,
that is how I equip them.  if I am a class that can wear
leather, I get the armor I need, often my first weapon
upgrade from the newbie weapon, and money to buy spells
with.  You won't get rich with this, as it is a newbie quest
but like I said if you pay 3pp or less for a stack of bone
chips from others, you can come out just slightly ahead
usually.   Patchwork isn't great but it's better than
nothing and frees up other money to be spent on usefully
items, like wisdom/int gear, spells, etc.  I also usually
would do the mail quest at the same time.  grab the mail in
Kaladim and from the docks in bb and run it back to
Kelethin.  Not a great quest, but probably the only area
where it's decent to do as a newbie because it's so close,
and once you get gate, its even closer.  

As for recommendations for a newbie cleric once you have
your spells taken care of, silver jasper rings, +2 wis each
are nice, as is the savant's cap generally under 50 pp (+3
wis/+3 int).  Not sure what a blood stained tunic goes for
these days but it's another 3 wisdom.  While I am not a fan
of Crushbone, you can get to your thirtys with out ever
leaving the continent.  BB or G'fay til about level 8, bb
can actually take you higher with the chess board, etc.  I
prefer going the goblin camp route, as opposed to fighting
over the limited number of orcs in g'fay, then crushbone or
the chessboard til around 15, then head to Unrest and do
yard trash until you can start fighting the higher stuff. 
The basement spawns and the upstairs spawns can get you into
your low to mid 30's.  I suppose you could even go higher
than that if you head to Kedge keep, but you will need some
sort of Enduring Breath, preferably as a constant effect
item (fishbone earring or that sort of thing).  I have never
fought Kedge Keep, but it is a mid 30's to 50 dungeon at
least.  I don't necessarily recommend staying on one
continent, as there is a huge world to see, but it is an
option.
