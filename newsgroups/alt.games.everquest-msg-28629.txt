Perhaps "obsolete" wasn't the right word .. How about "not worth near as
much as they used to be" =P

Example .. GEBs dropped from 8-9k down to 4-5k. Mammoth Cloaks from 2k to
<1k. Frozen Orbs from 4k to <2k. Stuff like that. People saying that asking
3k for ES Vambs is insane, then the /auc to buy them for 1k. I think the
value of all my equipment has dropped by at least 33% in the few months I've
been gone. It wouldn't be that much of a problem if I hadn't of retired my
druid, but when I'm selling that stuff off to equip my warrior, there's a
noticable difference.
