}I have all expansions so I dont know how it's handled when you cast a

Well... I have an account with no Velious.  When I forget and try to gate 
a char. on that account to WL, or wander into the GD/toxx spires at the 
wrong point in the cycle, I tend to get a free ride to the safe spot of 
whatever zone I'm in, and a message that I'm trying to enter a zone 
that's down.  So really, the 'don't have the expansion' case is handled 
already, it would appear.  -I- think it's because they thought making the 
nexus too efficient would nerf druids too much.  And having people able to 
port there from anywhere would just be an extra nail in the ol' taxi 
service's coffin.

It seems silly given how things have developed since.  But I thinkthat's 
about what they were thinking.
