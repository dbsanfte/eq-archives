    Well, true enough for that, I suppose.  But every full
group
of twenties I've been in (barring spectacularly idiotic
groups)
could also take down white, yellow, and low red cons, also 
without breaking a sweat.  Get a couple of adds, and sure,
it's
time to sweat, but we were talking about single mobs here.
The cons might not based off a soloer at level twenty, but
they
don't seem to be based off of a full group either.
