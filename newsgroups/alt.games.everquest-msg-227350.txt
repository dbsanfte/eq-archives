I'm arguing the merits of /random, not the elimination of NBG. I do 
believe that NBG has its place, just not in the typical pickup group.

I'm sorry. Let me be as specific as possible so that I'm not 
misunderstood *or* mis-paraphrased. *Many* people would do so, 
particularly those who are very interested in or in great need of 
improving their gear. This number would possibly be enough to create more 
lopsided-use zones akin to Paludal Caverns and Rathe Mountains, only 
instead of xp or plat, the fought over commodity would be class-specific 
gear.

Btw, "random greed"? Nice rhetoric, but gimme a break. :P
