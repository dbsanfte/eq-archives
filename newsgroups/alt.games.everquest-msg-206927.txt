people say different things, but i would say get as much STR as possible,
then DEX, then HP.....as you level up, it will be easier to get good STR and
DEX, so you might want to search for HP then, but STR and DEX = where your
damage comes from

45 =(

Locustlure.

i don't know what the spear is, and couldn't find it in a search of alla's
.. . . i know a great little item would be a shaded dagger, it's 11/22 with
some stats, and usually about 200p or so (fennin) ...should be nice

how do you like the locustlure? does it proc enough for you? are you happy
with it? if not, a nice little item is a glowing black sword, 9/22 and +20
dex . . .usually they're cheap because after 44 they proc nullify magic,
killing your buffs.....again, around 200 or 300p on that, and it will help
your backstabs and general ability to connect (make spam!) . . .maybe you
can get one and swap it out after slow lands..../shrug

it's hard to find plate graphic items for rogues, other than
arms/wrists/feet, so...actually, i don't know for head
