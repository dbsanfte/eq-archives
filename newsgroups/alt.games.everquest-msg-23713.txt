Im a level 18 iskar warrior and i have a few questions about how much damage
i can do.

Since level 13 or so i had a two handed pratice sword and it does about 28
damages when i use it against mobs , and thats really cool however as ive
leveled it doesn't seem to go up at all at level 18 i still only hit for 28.
which seems odd to me. I have been told thats there is a damage cap on
warrior and i can only hit for that amount.

My question is  when does the cap come off, its sooo hard to level right
now,, and what should i expect when it does.
