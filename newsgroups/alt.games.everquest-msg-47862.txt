Yes, I know, but it was just so appropriate that it should happen to
that raid after all the phone/ISP fuss I had to get on in time :)

No chance of that not happening, since this was a raid posted to the
EMarr board. I'm also on a raid mailing list (so far, I've gone on 3
Hole raids, but their plane raids are morning hours US time and I
won't be able to go on them until I move out of here) that never
announces raids for that reason, and they also keep an eye out for
announced colliding raids and try to keep alternate locales an option
for the times when someone beats them somewhere.
