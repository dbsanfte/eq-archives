Well.. you're certainly not alone in those feelings.. there are plenty
who agree with you.

Agreed.

Well... i start by saying that i started playing this game in
September of 2002. PoP was out in October but even with that month I
had the opportunity to witness a lot of the problems that were around
back then as i leveled.

>the stratification of the player base by huge differences in gear quality

On this point... from my perspective, this problem was a lot worse
back then. The first guild I ever joined.. we raided HoT for gear that
couldn't hold a candle to VT gear. And really.. at that time, there
weren't a lot of options. Family guilds in VT? When hell froze over.
Even if you wanted to and had the gear, some uber guild would just
cockblock Emp while they gave you the finger.

The droppable shit you could buy was exactly that.. shit. Sure you had
your old-school Cloak of Flames... and if you wanted to farm for ages
i suppose you could have bought one, but I was just worried about
money for Cobalt. Money was harder to come by allthough it was getting
better.. i still remember farming the Ferrott for hours on end. The
fact is you either levelled hard, learned fast, had connections, and
joined a high-end guild or got in a family guild and had fun on older
content while you hopefully got some useful gear. I went for the
latter. I feel myself blessed that I did Hate before the revamp, and
yeah.. we even did old style raiding in groups even while the raid
window was available. You never know the fun of hours without xp while
the officer group sits there rolling in it, unless you've been there.
Still.. it was an experience like no other.

With Planes of Power.. the difference between the haves and have-nots
has grown very diminished compared to where it was. There are plenty
of targets to go around.. that certainly drop things that would have
blown my mind back then. Even the most basic.. the BoT towers can be
found up a lot of the time because they are up so often. Even Time is
getting demystified lately with most servers having at least 3-4
guilds in it with more almost there. If you want to advance, its
certainly available to you and you have your pick of guilds at the
high end rather than just 1 or 2 main guilds. Elemental flagging san
RZ is a joke. To even claim that stuff is hard anymore is laughable.

>and physical seperation of them into zones where they dont encounter
>one another.

I would certainly like to see more of the progressive level zone that
was predominant in EQ's early days.

>POK, POP flagging and the ever increasing disparity between 'raid' and
>'non raid' gear kill EQ for me..

It should have killed you back then too, because it was a lot worse
with not many avenues for advancement. Heck.. these days if you wanted
to you could never raid, group exclusively and buy LDoN gear we would
have killed for back then. It'll get even better when they drop the
elemental quality stuff on the LDoN merchants.

>and I say this as a member of a high end time conquering raiding guild.

>POP turned EQ into... space invaders.

I'd say LDoN did that. The repetition was incredible.

>Forced its conception of the world on you and made EQ story and player
>irrelevant and into a 'beat the levels' fantasy space invaders.

For me Space Invaders was all about doing the same thing over and over
again.. just a little faster. As such, I don't see it in the same
light as something like Planes of Power... because PoP was all about
overturning the status quo and building a base that could give us
events like The Rathe, Agnarr, Rallos Zek, Quarm. Previous to PoP..
those things were simply impossible. Furthermore, each event tended to
be radically different then the other. If you tried the simple Space
Invaders style tank/heal that had been drummed into people over 3
years of play, you got your ass handed to you. It made you think,
something Space Invaders never did.

>Scars of velious *easily* ranks as the best EQ expansion in my opinion.

>It was open ended

Retarded is more like it. They still have apologizing to do for The
Sleeper bullshit. Whoever thought that up needs to be shot. Its still
a toss-up as to whether this is 'open-ended' or 'broken'. I don't
necessarily mind the story... its a good one, the mob is wicked, but
they just kind of made him unkillable unless you have 300 people and 4
hours of zerging.

Personally.. i thought that shit was part of a long ring. If you read
the Crusader text in SS after the changeover i figured there would be
a long quest by guilds to reentomb Kerafyrm to set right what was done
wrong, you get different drops at different points of a weeks long
ring, and then recycle once he's back in the tomb guarded by the
ancients, with the old stuff back and dropping(i.e. SoD). But nope..
they just put up text about Kerafyrms return, washed their hands,
stopped development, and sent it live.

>, the difference in gear quality was substation but not overwhelming and
>players still mingled when they levelled and raided.

It was overwhelming imo. I started as a human warrior main from the
ground up. Weapons? good fucking luck. Get yourself the money and buy
a lammy/frosty hahahaha. Want EB weapons? Find yourself an uber guild.
I suppose it would have been better as a caster.. but there were still
FT issues and most casters were sitting at FT1 from the Solstice
earring.. if they were lucky. Meanwhile uber guilds could cap a lot of
their casters at FT15. 

These days, you're talking a base of FT11 for a caster using only the
single group content and having the expansions up through GoD. No
guild needed. Just group and get it.

Of course it did.. usually followed by a week of killing for very
shitty xp unless you could hunt down whatever uber guild ended up
doing AoW or Tormax.

>In leet speek terms 'Velious Pwn3d d00d!' ;)

I love the Velious expansion.. don't get me wrong. I just think PoP
did a hell of a lot more for the game. You see that as a negative... i
view it as a positive.

It was no more consumable imo than any other expansion.
