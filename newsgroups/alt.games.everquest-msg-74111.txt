Yeah, 45 was a nightmare.  A marathon of xp grinds.

I thought it would never be matched, and then came 54 *shiver*

Once you finish 45 its relitivly easy to get to 51, and then it starts to
crawl.  The best thing to do when you hit 51 is to play to have fun.
Period.  If you focus on leveling, especially as a casual gamer, you will
burn yourself out.  Start doing a few quests, do a little faction work, go
on dragon raids, etc...
