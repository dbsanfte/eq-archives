My only concern with the MX cards (for EQ and SoL) is the restricted
memory bandwidth (They run SingleDataRate not DoubleDataRate). SoL is
pushing a LOT of textures, as evidenced by the steep memory
requirements. You really need to get a card with a lot of ram with the
fastest pipeline for that ram as possible.

If you can push your budget a little further (@$15-30) go with the GF2
GTS 64mb DDR.

Cheers
