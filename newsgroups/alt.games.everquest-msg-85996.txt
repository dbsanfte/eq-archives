I'm not sure that you are saying that everyone that gets robbed is
stupid, but for what its worth, you can do everything right and still
find you car missing from the campany owned and security employee 
lot. I had my keys, my card to exit garage and the door was locked.
Came out, broken glass in my spot. The guard who sees me drive out
everyday in that car never wondered about the windowless car that
looked like mine be driven out by a visitor who lost their parking
ticket. (The company didn't even give me the 6.50 daily parking fee he
collected).

Off topic, 

Ken
