In case you wanted to make the run, you can port into Jagged Pine via
the teleport stone in Surefall or the teleport stone in Blackburrow.
There is a zone line inside the Brell gnolls cave behind [West of]
their Oracle (inside their fort), across a pool of water (not the big
shallow pool inside their gate).

Zones into a passage that leads to the upper level of Nedarias, the
non-lev way down to the lower is in the north part of zone past
waterfall. Generally all non-rangers and non-druids are kos to the
animals.
