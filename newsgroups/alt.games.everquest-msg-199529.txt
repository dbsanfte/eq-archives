    You shouldn't have moved coin from your sales mule to your main. ;-)

    I didn't spot one. I noticed someone else used a budget of 1 K pp and
pretty much got what the kits provided. Since 20 character slots times 50 pp
is 1 K pp, it could also be that the devs that did this had a 1 K budget
rather than a per-item cap like I used.

    It's meant to simulate what real characters have. That includes things
like uneven distribution of gear due to discrepancies in demand and rarity.
That helps determine what underpowered twink gear to throw into the next
expansion!!
