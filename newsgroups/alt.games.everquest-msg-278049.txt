Yes, and that's the tradeoff I've occasionally bumped up against.
I try not to be at zero plat for both of those reasons, but then
I have to decide when it's worth spending it.  More than once, I've
bought a bargain for resale, and then moments later spotted another
bargain that I actually want to buy and keep, but I no longer have
the cash for it.

The Barter Hall has helped in this regard.  Now I can list the items
I'm looking for to keep, and setting aside some plat on my Barter
mule means I'm far less likely to spend it on "investment" items.
