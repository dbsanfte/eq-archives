LOL  Yup, I realized the SoW issue after I posted...  Never played anything
other than my current Ranger, so I'm really sketchy on what spells the
others get and when...  I happened to be looking up Shaman spells yesterday
to see if they get some sort of invis or something and that's when I noticed
that SoW is a 9th level spell I think...

I also hunted with a Necro for a short time last night...  First time.
Necros have some very interesting spells...  hehe  This guy was only a few
levels higher than me and we were killing Giants in Warslik's.  I'm very
used to hunting with my Druid friend, so I was very nervous hunting with a
non healer.  I learned quickly that there was no reason for me to be afraid
at all.  Necros have very cool spells...

*Wondering now which Class I will make for next character...*  hehe
