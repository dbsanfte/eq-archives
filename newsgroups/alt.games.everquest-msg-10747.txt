Some people are just strange...

When I was still studying, I took a class called Computers and
Society. As part of a group project, I wrote a paper about social life
on the internet, and the dangers involved. (It focused mainly on chats
and muds, but can apply to games like EQ as well) There are a lot of
people who will do *anything* to get some cyber or find someone they
can leech off of IRL through the internet, such as lying about their
age and gender and personal life. And while they'll probably be more
inclined to do it on a free chat program rather than pay 10 bucks a
month to do it in a game...
Of course, stuff like gender bending is more often innocent
roleplaying both in EQ and in those chats :)
