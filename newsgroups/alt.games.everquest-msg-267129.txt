Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a 10 Shaman in Qeynos for some 
starting armor.  I'm running around in mostly the cloth stuff I got on the 
island and with so many quests available, I'm wondering which ones will give 
me some better armor.  OR if anyone has a link to a place that has a decent 
list of armor quests and such, that would be great too, believe me I 
searched.

Thanks.  So far enjoying the game.
