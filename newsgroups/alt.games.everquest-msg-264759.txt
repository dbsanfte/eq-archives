People remember EQ at launch just fine. Those same people will be in the 
EQ2 launch. Those same people won't spend six months fumbling around 
learning to group, learning the ui, learning where to buy spells, 
learning what the spells do, etc etc etc.

Entire guilds are aleady formed and waiting for launch. Groups and 
websites are ready to catalog spells, and items. Boards are already 
raring to go.

As everyone has said, 8 hours was facetious, but seriously give it 2-3 
days and you'll see guides posted on those boards on how to get to 20+ 
in 2 days: where to hunt, what to hunt, how to hunt it, what it drops, 
and what that sells for/

There will never be anything like EQs launch again.
