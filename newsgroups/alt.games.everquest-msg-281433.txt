Twink pick up groups are my most rewarding ones. The twinked players are 
after a bit of fun or just want to level their alts quicker than normal 
without PL'ing them and as such, tend to leave most of the drops for 
non-twinked players to loot.
Even with my main in an Elemental flagged guild, I am still picking up very 
nice upgrades from my fellow players in the form of no drop "If this is an 
upgrade, come get it in Nobles Causeway /loc . . . . . . " items. As to my 
alts, they are god like to me in gear considering what I had when I first 
started playing thanks to other members hand me downs and similar no drop 
tells. At the end of the day, go out and play to your style for the fun of 
it, get some of the DoD missions for fast level progression, poke your head 
into zones where even the other players pets are higher /con than you and 
look for shouts to come collect rotting gear, lots of different ways to 
upgrade your gear for free.
