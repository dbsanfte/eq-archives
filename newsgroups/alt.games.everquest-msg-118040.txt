ok, I have a HP Pavilion also , and upgraded my video card
this is what I did.
first thing I did was leave the i810 drivers on, don't change them to
standerd VGA.
then put the Video card in to the first PCI slot, after connecting the
moniter to the new card,
turned computer on and it did booted up from the video card.
Windows will go thru the install new driver mode.
I think by adding the card it disabale the i810 video, but when you are in
the Display Properties/Settings you will see pictures of 2 monitors. the
first one should be your new card, secound one will be the i810 but will be
grayed out.
hope this hepls you . took me 3 reinstalls of  Windows to figure this one
out

P.S. I am never getting another HP agian.
