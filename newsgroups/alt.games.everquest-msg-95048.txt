Agreed, however it is still possible to do, simply less efficient, and
getting Lightning Blast does open up your horizons to more hunting areas,
such as Cobalt Scar off the top of my head, kind of like how most people
wait until 58 and Fist of Karana to quad Othmir. (or use a Lumi staff, a
lot)

Then again I've also heard of people quadding back at level 5 with that
crappy AoE we get then (Invoke Lightning), though I think its kinda nuts,
more power to them.
