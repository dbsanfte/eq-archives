Naww...just means in a couple of months everyone will be lvl 60 and all
characters will play the same, except some will get to cast spells.  Not
that I disagree with balancing the hell levels a bit (because 45 IS
ridiculous), but no spell book?  I mean should a brand new (insert type of
caster here) be born and know how to meditate and keep track of all that's
going on?  If the changes to 1-10 are a fact like I've read, maybe the book
should stay in at least that long to give a sense of accomplishment.  Of
course I am biased, having taken about half a dozen characters past "book"
level =).  My biggest concern is the "dumming" down of the game to the point
it will be just like AO or the Microsoft one (name escapes me at the
moment), where there are really no "role-playing" aspects as getting new
skills every once in a while.  I mean, what's next...all characters start at
lvl one maxed in all skills, spell levels, etc?  "shrug" When it gets to
that, I'll find something else to do =) ... be safe all, Bill
