I disagree.  The Bush propaganda machine worked night and day for
weeks (months?) to "prove" Hussein had WMDs.  His lies convinced most
of America and the Congress.

Much of the intelligence "evidence" used by Bush was known by
intelligence officials to be false, and told him so.  He used that
"evidence" anyway (such as the aluminum tubes fiasco).

President Bush is a liar, plain and simple.  A liar.  He bore false
witness against his neighbor.  (It's funny that people consider him a
Christian.  He's proven not to subscribe to Christian ideals over and
over and over again.)

If *I* were Hussein?  I'd have admitted to having them and showed the
inspectors where they were, and bent over backwards trying to
ingratiate myself with the world and my neighbors again, starting with
an apology for hostilities in the early 1990s with an offer to pay
reparations, and ask for help getting oil flowing again so that those
reparations could be paid.

What's the point of this intellectual exercise, anyway?

Where do you draw the line?  After how many lives do those lives
become important?  Be sure to tell the parents of those 1000+ that
it's okay they died, it's not a big enough number of American deaths
to matter yet.

Spoken like an armchair warrior who hasn't lost anyone they care about
themselves in an unjustified war.  Nothing ever matters until it
happens to you, right?

Not at all.  Bush's disasterous errors in judgement are there for the
world to see.

Do those goals include increasing numbers of American deaths month
after month, not to mention the "accidental" slaughter of tens of
thousands of innocent Iraqis?

As it stands right now, we're losing the guerilla war, especially
since two terrorists take the place of every fallen one, thanks to
Bush aggravating the hell out of the entire arab world.

Exactly my point.  It's too late now, due to Bush's incompetence.

They didn't look to be re-arming, unless you're talking about the
manufactured "evidence" the Bush administration pushed.  And who cares
about those other things, anyway?  "Violated multiple sanctions" does
not put America at risk.  It's called the "Department of DEFENSE" for
a reason.

Iraq was NOT a threat to America, and the Bush administration knew
it.

Are you being purposefully obtuse?  Nobody even remotely suggested
those kinds of remedies.

Another Reagan worshipper.  How typical.

Reagan's policies ballooned the national debt, whose interest we'll
apparently be paying for the rest of our natural lives, through higher
federal taxes.

Without checks and balances, human greed always leads to domination.

There will always be a corporation who wants to save a few bucks by
dumping toxic waste, or a corporation who "cooks the books" and screws
its investors to make the high level executives a few extra bucks per
share, or a corporation who won't be satisified until they have 100%
market share and will use any means at their disposal (whether those
means are ethical or unethical) to make sure their competition is
slaughtered.  And then, of course, jack up the price of their
products.

That's why we have a government.  People recognized their own
weaknesses, and setup a system to protect themselves from themselves.

Pure capitalism (no government oversight) leads to corporations
dominating everyone.
