      I was in the Warrens, level 30, slaughtering Kobolds so that I
might one day go into Paineel and bank even as I slaughter the guards. 
I was alone. Just for laughs, I go see if The Muglwump is up.  It was,
and it conned dark blue to me.  I take a deep breath, and decide to go
for it.  I tell my guild I am going to try, and  they all seem to think
it would be an interesting experiment.  I attack the thing, then realize
I don't have my DD damage spell memmed.  Oops.  I make it to the zone
(thanks, J-boots!).  I tell them about my embarrassing  failure, and
they all share a good laugh.  I med up, mem wrath, make sure the SoW is
refreshed, and zone back to try again.  I get to the pool, and say to
the guild again "Round two... Teapray vrs %t! Wish me luck!" (Yes, I am
lazy typist).  Then I realized that I didn't have The Muglwump targeted,
but rather some stupid, very, very green to me kobold outcast.  There
was alot of laughter, cries of "give it hell, Teapray!" and offers from
the 45+'s to come help me with my baby kobold. /sigh
    Another of my guildees had a similar silly guildsay conversation. 
She is one the higher level druids in the guild, and one of the most
popular.  She always comes to help anyone if needed, and is very
generous and sweet.  Really, we all love her.  So when she typed /sob!
in guild speak, everything ground instantly to a halt.  We all anxiously
asked what was wrong.  I offered to rez whomever died.  Lenny offered to
kill whatever was bothering her.  Most of the guild did the same with
whatever their talent was.  She told us between /sobs that her faction
in some place (Shadowhaven, if I recall right, but might not) had
dropped from ally to indifferent.   We all assured her that her guild
faction was maxed, and offered ideas on what could have gone wrong.  She
hadn't been hunting the wrong stuff.  She wasn't cammoed.  Was she
wolf-formed?  
   Bingo.  She was obviously embarrassed.  We all told her that we still
loved her.  But is was funny.  In /tell she told me that she had also
/petitioned, but I told her not to worry about it since there was an
excellent chance she would never get a response from the gods (as we
call them in my roleplaying guild on FV).
   Guildspeak.  Fun for the whole family!

Annie <---  Did manage to slay the Muglwump.  Go me!
