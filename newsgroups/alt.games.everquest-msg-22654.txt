GFay on Sullon is a buyers market. CB belts are selling for 2gp each. Some
pretty good items come up for sale once in a while. Goss robes and steins of
mog'k are sold frequently. Selling stuff is not very profitable at all...
You can maybe sell bonestacks or CB belts in BB and make a little money. An
interesting profession has arisen however, in low level below PK range
players making supply runs for trade materials, quest items, and spells for
the higher level folk (especially bards because of the lvl 5 sellos).
