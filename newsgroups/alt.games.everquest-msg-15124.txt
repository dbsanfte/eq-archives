And there is none to give him.

>killing giants raises faction with BOTH the coldain and CoV.

This is untrue. Different giants give different faction hits. If you kill
nothing but frost giants, it is trivial to be ally with the coldain, but
still be scowling with CoV, even if you've never killed a single CoV mob.

But there isn't.

Since there is great variety in what he may or may not have killed, there
is no way to determine one faction from the other.
