What is your clipping plane set to in EQ? I can see clear across a lot of smaller zones, and quite some distance
in larger ones, without any difficulty in EQ, at the extreme setting; however, I tend to pull it in a bit to
improve performance, as only a GeForce3 would be smooth with the clipping plane set so far, if anything could.
