You can pull with snare or arrows.  Arrows are longer range
though.  Make a Trueshot longbow and some 150 range arrows
and you'll be able to pull almost anything you can see.
And you'll usually have enough time to get a snare off before
the mob reaches you.

It is good for rangers to keep the archery skill up by
shooting lots of arrows.  The Trueshot discipline at level
55 makes archery worth it.
