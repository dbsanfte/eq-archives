Certain classes can solo and some can't.

You can solo any class, but doing so with some would be very painful
and take forever.

Necromancer. Hands down. Nothing else comes close.
You could solo all the wy to 70 and get all AA no problem.

Tank for the pet in the early levels this will get your dodge and defense 
skills up.
Make sure you get the Banshee Aura spell and use it.

Eventually you won't be able to tank any more. Then switch to fear-kiting.

Farm tradeskill items like spider and spiderling silks and sell them in the 
bazaar.
Then buy new equipment with your cash. Get items with hit points. To a 
necromancer
hit points are your mana since you get spells to convert it.
