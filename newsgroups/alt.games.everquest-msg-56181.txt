You are seeing the results of a shift in Internet browsing and
hosting. 

The cost of bandwidth is getting higher every day. The "fancier" the
page the more bytes you have to ship out to your readers. This can be
VERY expensive, and many sites are trimming the fat. You don't need a
1-3mb page to get your point across to the reader.

As people become more skilled at browsing they lose interest in the
bells & whistles. "Just the facts..." is the rule for most savy
Internet users. How many flash intro pages do you need to see before
the novelty wears off?

The future is in high content low glitz web pages that serve the
desired information without wasting costly bandwidth.

Cheers
