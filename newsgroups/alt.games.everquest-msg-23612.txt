Rogues from opposing teams have pickpocketed me on several occasions.  The
most I ever lost was 10 silver.

Most of the pickpocketing attempts on me were before I reached level 6.  It
was one of the ways Neutrals would harrass the lowbies from Team Good in
Qeynos.  I thought the attempts on my wallet were rather funny, myself, as
most of the rogues lacked any skill to be successful.

Once while standing along the road outside the gate in NQeynos, I got the
message that I caught Soandso trying to open my purse.  Then the game made
me give an NPC-style zone-wide shout in white letters, "Help!  Guards!
Guards!  Stop, thief!"

The other messages I've gotten have been interesting, too.  "You feel a tug
at your purse."  "Your coin purse feels a little lighter." and, "You have
been pickpocketed!".... all depending on the skill of the rogue and how well
they succeed or how miserably they fail.
