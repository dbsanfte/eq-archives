They CAN, they may NOT but they CAN.  A guildy decided he was addicted and
deleted his characters.  A month later he came back (he is addicted) and
asked & was told that they couldn't.

Be as polite as humanly possible, don't abbreviate ANYTHING, don't cop ANY
sort of attitude beyond helplessness and gratitude and you might have a
shot.
