But those opinions do exsist and have been enforced. 

A stanford law professor wrote an interesting paper on MMORPGs and
legal rights, can't recall his name, but do a quick search and you
should pull it up. 

Or, I'll find ya a quick link to a similar story on CNN.com:

Same legal principal applies, just hasn't been tested on these shores,
to my knowledge...

See above...
