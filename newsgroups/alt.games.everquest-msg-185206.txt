Nice read, but I'm going to have to rain on your parade about your
droolworthy weapon.

According to Shaman's Crucible testing, procs are constant and  independant
of weapon speed - in effect: you get a faster weapon, you proc less.
And the Two-tined Corpse pitchfork combines all the flaws of one-handed
weapons (too fast for decent damage bonues, casting spells has more of an
effect on melee DPS) combined with the flaws of a two-handed weapon (no
shield, mainly)
