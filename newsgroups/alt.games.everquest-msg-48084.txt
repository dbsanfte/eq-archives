Yeah, but what is it that makes them to choose smoking tobacco instead of, 
say, poking themselves with sharp sticks? It's a combination of peer 
pressure and advertising. The idea that smoking is somehow "cool" or a 
rebellious, anti-establishment, "young" kind of thing to do is implanted 
and reinforced by the advertising campaigns. I've never seen a tobacco ad 
campaign (for cigarrettes, cigars are a bit different) that wasn't built 
around the concept of being "cool".

I totally agree with you about teenagers, but while most of them will 
cheerfully agree to the fact that they are reckless and even stupid, they 
won't be so ready to admit how immensely vulnerable to even the crudest 
advertising techniques they are.  They are basically puppets, and with the 
same ease you can get them to buy Britney Spears albums, you can get them 
to smoke.

Unfortunately, a discriminating mind and a resistance to hostile memes are 
things that only come with age (sometimes) or *very* careful parenting. Not 
everybody is lucky enough to have that.
