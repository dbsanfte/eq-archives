I've been playing EverQuest for about nine months now, and have
decided to start a second account. I originally bought EQ Classic,
standalone, and soon "upgraded" with a EQ Trilogy
(EQClassic/Kunark/Velious), which left me with an unregistered key for
EQ Classic. 

So I've used that to create the second account, and so far
everything's going great. Unforunately, I'm unable to travel to
Luclin, seeing as how that key is registered with my main account, the
one I really don't use much. Is it at all possible to transfer the
Luclin key to my new account, instead of having it on my old one? I'd
really like to be able to get back to Luclin without having to be
forced to shell out MORE cash for something I already have.

Thanks.
