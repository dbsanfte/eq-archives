New people join the group all the time. Others might simply have not
read previous related threads as it didn't apply to them. I'll always
suggest that camp for the right level range and classes that can do it.
IMO it's one of the best in the game under the right conditions, and not
a lot of people use it. (Most always empty when I go.)

If it's bothering you, I can send you detailed instructions on killfiles
for most commonly used news readers.
