    See above under "...unless you wait for so long that you get the aid
from future expansions to overcome an encounter." As an example, the people
breezing through Veeshan's Peak now, that never did it before, are doing so
with armour and weapons from one expansion past Kunark and AA abilities from
two expansions past Kunark. So they've had to wait to be able to "breeze"
through the zone - something that's lost on a lot of "nerf 'em now" types.

    /agree on the first part, disagree on the second. Velious set the
standard - whine, and they shall enhance. "NToV loot is crap." Boom,
retroactive upgrades. "Having plus piercing on rogue weapons is silly."
Bang, plus backstab retro-fitted to the weapons. Rewards are being enhanced
to match the risks, the rewards are being retro-enhanced, then the encounter
is being upgraded to match the new standard. If you handed gear to Mort
pre-NToV enhancement in some bizarre potlatch ritual, or let it rot, then
who is to blame for not reaping the benefits of this?

    You mean like Shei? :-) Again, very valid point. I don't feel that it
sets you back that much, though - one wipe due to a bug and you leave it
alone until it's fixed. A lower guild has to bang their collective heads
against an enhanced encounter until they finish it because they need what
they get from it to do the next encounter.
