I can't believe no one's mentioned bards... Once again, bards can do 
freaking everything, Grab a mob, get it down to 1-2% life, charm it as 
this wipes the hate list in the process, then chain it and let the PLee 
beat on it however they normally would.  Throw in a MR debuff if need be 
or a slow of some kind.  Clerics can do similar, grab a mob, get it way 
down, atone, root, let the PLee finish it off.  Never played a chanter, 
but I would expect them to be similar and they have a DS I'm pretty 
sure.  As long as you can wipe agro, you can do most of the work and let 
them get the last few hits in.  Just my little experience and I might be 
biased as my 2 mains are a bard and a cleric :)
