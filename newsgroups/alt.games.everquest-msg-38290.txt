The quest has been made a bit harder<bugged?>. Drosco now spawns as "a
zombie" vs named. Slow spawn, I don't know if it is a problem with place
holder or a triggered spawn gone bad.

He is in the same room with 3 large rats and if you kill the rats,
occasionally "a nesting rat" will appear that carries a +3 charisma locket
and as you have noticed, a gelatinous cube. I just killed him on RZ last
week, so he still spawns.

Just my op, but you may want to consider doing the Lightbringer<?> quest
instead. It requires some travel, you have to get 3 honeycombs and 30 gold
to a halfling in Rivervale to get a potion, turn it in to a NPC at the
temple and give the resulting potion to a NPC in West Karanas. Few more
hoops you have to jump through, but that is about it. The NPC seems to kill
you about 1/2 the time, but at least you don't have to wait for everything
to spawn.

IMHO: Lightbringer is one of the best quests in the game, probably only one
of a handful where you actually get something level appropriate out of
hundreds.

Down side is it is best done by <when done by a low level character> that
can travel with invisibility, only works for characters with high priest
faction, and the weapon is paly/cleric only. Needs a level 5 druid or level
4 enc for the travel or some type 8+.
