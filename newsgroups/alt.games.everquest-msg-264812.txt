But that utterly fails to consider the "consumers dillema". Do I buy A, 
B, or C. Because I'm not shelling out for 3 titles at full price. If A&B 
have a co-bundle, then that gives them a real edge towards my 
walletshare.

When I see replacing multiple billing system's... I see 'economies of 
scale'. Your other comment about requiring companies to accurately 
report usage is legitimate, but I think overcomeable.

"can" still generate. But statistically they won't. A real business case 
would establish the break even point. I think it will prove favourable, 
you don't. Nuff said about that.

Moreover, I think funcom et al will score thousands of 10 hour players 
they don't currently have. I think the number of players currently 
playing 10 hours of AO, and 40 hours of SB paying for both is 
vanishingly small compared to the number of SB players not playing AO at 
all, who would pick it up for the incremental all-pass cost.
