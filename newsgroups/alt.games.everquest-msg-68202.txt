Okay, I can't take it anymore.

NO, I don't get this problem at all and I'm sorry you do.  My SBLive! under
XP on a P3 will be beautiful - full acceleration - balls out.  I get the
running water to my left, griffon flapping yonder, people milling about
behind....then the unspeakable happens

Just sometimes though...if I'm in a tunnel area or like outside the bank in
Thurg, and I jump - it issues forth what I have come to call the 'shriek
from hell'.

Sounds alot like what happened in this one band I played in when someone
would get pissed off and knock over a mic stand near an amplifier.

Feedback on an epic scale.  To top it off, my PC mic is definitely muted and
unplugged from the card anyway so I *know* it's not feeding back from that.
The card just goes absolutely apeshit and like I said - that sound is
actually so terrible I play in complete silence - screw the turning down the
acceleration - if you heard this sound it would make the hair on the back of
your neck stand up.  Oh, and my cat looks at me like 'wtf?' with those big,
scared, cat-eyes then she hauls ass.

I'd die for some tinny popping sounds man...and again, sorry for your
misfortune.
