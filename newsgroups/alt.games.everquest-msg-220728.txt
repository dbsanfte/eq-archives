Historically documented, Druid's *means of expression* has included animal
and human sacrifice, the laying of curses, the calling of spirits (usually
animal and tree spirits), etc.  They also often lived away from the main
community, in caves or crude shelters in the wilderness, and hunted/foraged
for their food instead of partaking of crops.

Still sound like they shouldn't have tracking?
