When my ranger was 35 I spent all my time in FM and did not hardly even
notice the hell level. Milage may vary though, I quit going to the fort
at 33, except when I was bored and buffed, (met a nice 46 level cleric),
then I would go to the fort and pull a few giants to dine on solo.

FM is a great zone to solo or work as a small group, (my favorite style
of play is to have a group of 2-3). The area near the DL zone is good,
there is usually a steady stream of mobs coming along the south wall,
but one can also pull from the area out front of the zone. One must
watch for the wandering mobs a bit.

The best area I found was on the south wall about halfway between 0 and
the DL zone. About where Nurga is. Wonderful spot, you can pull stuff
down from the wall, or the mobs wandering the field.
