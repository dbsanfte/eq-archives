I thought I had a site which listed prices players are paying for items. 
But I cannot find it.

My current situation is that I have a number of Mechanotablets used for 
making Mechanoinstructions used in AAAA for making augments.  I understand 
that some are quite valuable and some not very valuable.  My goal would be 
to convert a few to Mechanoinstructions, but would like to select the ones 
most in demand, that is, which will bring the highest price.

Any help?
