You seem very vocal here ~W about matters you know fuck all about. FD for a
Monk is a class ability you get skill ups as you would practicing your 1HB
2HS etc. Then tehre are improvements to FD with AA such as the refresh time
between when you can FD. Also when a Monk FD's there is a chance to lose
Agro imeadiately.

SK FD is a spell, it takes time to cast, and time to refresh so you can cast
again, it can get interupted as can any spell you cast when being beat on,
some mobs are not fooled by FD as easily as others and its very hard for an
SK to split caster mobs. SK's do not lose agro like a Monk does, it may take
5 or 6 FD's to finaly break free ( pre nerf CoS owns here ) and when
splitting mobs the usual SK tactic is to snare a mob, run back a while then
FD and wait for mobs to return to spawn point, the snared one will stay put
and can now be tagged or pulled safely.
