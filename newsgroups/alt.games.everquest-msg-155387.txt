Did they fix this with the current patch?  It's been broken since the 26th
of Sept, and playing on FV makes it that much harder to group deal with
others.

For those that don't know and care, you can only train languages with /tells
(which have a limit of no more than one tell every 1.5 secs).  I would not
mind if the slowed down the skill gains, just get it back to /g so we can
teach more people at on time.
