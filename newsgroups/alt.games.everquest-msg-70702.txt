In excess of exuberance, I just felt like shouting.

I just got Kromriff Leggings for my 34 Druid, Broodmother did her job
without a hitch, Fergul Frostsky died thanks to a 52 Druid in my guild, and
a few onlookers  (Thanks Citgo for the epic poke) took a swing for faction.

I ninja the leggings, and camp out to keep them from poofing because the
world comes down 2 minutes later, log back in, run from giant fort to
thurgadin, sow some naked warrior.

Broadcast: WORLD COMING DOWN, EVERYONE LOG OUT NOW!
Broadcast: WORLD COMING DOWN, EVERYONE LOG OUT NOW!

I camp back out, and here I am.  =P

God I love my new pants.
