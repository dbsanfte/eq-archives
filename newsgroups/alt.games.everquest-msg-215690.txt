Never tried it, however logic suggests that it would work quite
well.  You'd have heals, hastes, slows, stat and HP buffs from
the shaman, snare, fear, tanking from the shadowknight.  You'd
lack real crowd control, but would have root at least, and you'd
lack serious DPS production, but would at least have SK plus two
pets.  A shaman can solo fairly well with just his own pet plus
DOTs for damage production, having the superior sponging from the
SK should help a good deal on mana efficiency.  Fear kiting would
mean the slows from the shaman wouldn't be so useful, but thats
an either/or thing, you have two plans; slow and tank or fear
kite, depending on which class ends up causing the most downtime
due to lack of mana... heck, you could alternate, use slow and
tank, but if the shaman goes LOM fear kite one while he catches
up, then go back to slowing.

Group also lacks DS, but that doesn't really stack all that well
with Slow anyway, and Rez... so try and make a point of not
dying.

Shaman plus anything usually makes a very nice duo, your pair
will also make a great core for forming larger groups, pretty
much anything will add well to it, with the possible exception of
a warrior.
