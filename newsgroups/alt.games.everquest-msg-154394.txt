Yes, but rats have much shorter lifespans than humans, and they are testing
on a much smaller population.  If it is known roughly how dosage affects
cancer rates, then it would be valid to give large doses to rats, so that
you'll actually get some who develop cancer, and then figure out from that
what the cancer rate would be in humans who take much smaller doses.
