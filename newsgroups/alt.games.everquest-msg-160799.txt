The other night I had a guildmate who decided to die in one of those
places where it's not a good idea to die.

I have a 41 Necro alt with the summon corpse spell and I figured that
I would just summon his corpse and problem solved.

We spent almost 2 hrs looking for coffins. We were told to get Black
Ceremonial Coffins which I found for 3 plat. I know coffins to summon
level 35 plus toons cost much more than 3 plat. After getting several
different stories of who, what and where we finally went and did an
old fashioned corpse run. 

It also amazed me how many high level necro's didnt even have the
spell. Can someone set the record straight and tell me which coffins
are used with which spells and where they can be purchased? 

I checked the usual places ( Alla, Casters Realm, etc) for the info
without any luck.....Thanks
