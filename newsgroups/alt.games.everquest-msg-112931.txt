A while back I looted a shiny brass shield from an orc, lore item, SV
magic +10, AC 10.   Last night I killed another orc who was carrying
the same shield.  When I tried to loot it, I got a message that said
something along the lines of, can only have one lore item, cannot pick
up shield, or something to that affect.   Before I try this, I thought
I would ask.....does anyone know, if I put my shield in the bank, can
I then pick up the second one, or will I still be prevented from
looting the second shield ?   Thanks!
