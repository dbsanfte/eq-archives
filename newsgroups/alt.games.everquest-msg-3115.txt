This was my exact thought as well.  With all of the things I have seen
Absor say are "valid points but not likely to be implimented anytime
soon as we have bigger fish to fry" I have a hard time this is
anything larger than a Killifish Hatchling (fry).

I cant believe THAT many Guild Leaders were SCREAMING for something
like this as much as I could see programmers who play that are in
guilds saying "You know, it would be nice if when I logged on I would
be reminded of upcoming raids and weddings and such or anything that
happened in my guild....that would be a simple addition....no time at
all.....<clickety click click> ....done....OK, add it to the patch
message please."

You tell me which is more important to the game.  Setting up a /GMotd
command or fixing drop rates on items in some of the Epics?  Or fixing
it so that multiple items put in a trade container dont just give you
1 of the item but rather a DNC message or the like.

Guild Message of the Day.  LMAO
