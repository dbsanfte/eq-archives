    I imagine it's the same reason why /who all insert_cussword_here will
often return a given guild's roster. The /who isn't looking for all the
words in the phrase, but some subset which it deems "close enough". I'd love
to see exactly how /who figures out what to look for, though. On my server,
/who all son of a bitch used to return the guild roster of At Death's Door.
What could /who have locked onto as being the key part?
