    There's weapons that drop in Luclin that actually have volume - I
believe the Spined weapons are one set of them. Drop the weapon on the
ground beneath you, and you get boosted up a little bit. Then drop a second
such weapon, and you get boosted a little higher. When you use third person
perspective and pick the bottom weapon up, the top weapon doesn't fall down
to the floor - it stays exactly where it is.

    Extrapolate. I won't tell you what to do when you get to the roof,
because with a little practice in a perfectly safe place with a similar roof
you can figure it out. A friend of our guild used these things to "climb"
from the base of the cliff in EK all the way to the top.
