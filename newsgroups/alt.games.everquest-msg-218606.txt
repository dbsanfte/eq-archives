I am rather surprised that noone has mentioned Charm-solo for chanters (I am
pretty sure, everyone has had chanter at some point of time).
Yes, you can solo thru choking the mob, and it's true that the furthere you
get in the game, the harder it gets to solo with animation (until 49, or
when you get AA-- at 65 =)
You still can choke them, but if you bumm/buy SoW off someone and go on a
charming rampage,-- you will die, your pet(the charmed one) will take a good
deal of XP, but you will be killing so fast that it really wouldn't matter.
Just know which zone to go to and what to charm. That can be read up.

Woland,
the Enchanter on Lanys T'Vil
