I had the same problem, got a cleric to his 50s from pick up groups but
had a tough time getting much beyond that due to very short periods of
play time.  I started a bard and have been having a blast, they are fun
to play albeit you'll have carpel tunnel syndrome in no time flat :)
Failing that a Necro is also fairly good to solo with.  You could also
try an assling druid just to further increase their general hatred
throughout the lands <g>
