My monk, also level 20, is currently working The Overthere. He spent
his teens in Kurn's -- main floor and upper levels -- which are a 
soloer's paradise. Nothing but non-social, low aggro-radius skeletons.
At 20 that has gotten mostly green, though. The basement might have
possibilities but all the spellcasting furbies down there spook me.

You're doing better than me...mine is only at 42. I can only push 
the FD button so many times without any skill increases before I
get frustrated and go back to reading usenet while healing up.
