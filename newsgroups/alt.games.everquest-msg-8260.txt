Experience loss on death does not get bad until much later in the game.
Considering how many idiots I've seen shouting for resurrections for hours
when they are in thier 20's or teen levels, a lot of people just don't
understand this (or are selfish enough to not care).   For deaths under level
20, you can make up the lost experience faster than the cleric would be able
to meditate back the mana used to resurrect you.   For levels 20 to 30, it's
not that much longer.

Once you are above level 40 is where the death penalties start to get extreme.
Each bubble in these levels takes *much* longer to fill, and you lose more of
them per death.   Not sure if I remember exactly, but I think at level 40 I
was losing about 1.5 or 2 or so blue bubbles per death.   Recovery of that
experience in a good group, perhaps an hour.   My last death at barely 46
(de-leveled down to 45) cost me one half of a super hell level orange bubble.
Luckily a friend had her cleric camped nearby, but if I had had to make up
that half of an orange, you're talking about 3 hours of non-stop killing in an
optimal group.  Quite a bit more if you have a mismatched party (class wise)
that can't keep pulling non-stop.


At level 60, I believe I've heard that you lose a full orange bubble, which at
that level takes many, many hours to get.

(Snip the rest, as Dan gave some good responses to those parts)
