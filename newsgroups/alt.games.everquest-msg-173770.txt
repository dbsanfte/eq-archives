Thank you, Neville Chamberlain.  I'm sure you have your
own plan for "peace in our time".

We have looked at the underlying reasons, and I'm afraid
that you're mistaken.

Try this for starters:
   http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/771724/posts

And hell, let's just read what Al-Qa'ida spokesman Suleiman Abu Gheith
wrote in a three-part article published by the Center for Islamic
Research and Studies:

   "This goes for every man - let alone when the man in
   question is of those who believe in Allah, in Islam as a
   religion, and in Muhammad as Prophet and Messenger, and
   anyone who knows that his religion is unwilling to allow
   him to be inferior and refuses to allow him to be humiliated." 

   "How can [he] possibly [accept humiliation and inferiority]
   when he knows that his nation was created to stand at the
   center of leadership, at the center of hegemony and rule,
   at the center of ability and sacrifice? How can [he] possibly
   [accept humiliation and inferiority] when he knows that the
   [divine] rule is that the entire earth must be subject to the
   religion of Allah - not to the East, not to the West - to no
   ideology and to no path except for the path of Allah?�" 

   [snip]

   "America is the head of heresy in our modern world, and it
   leads an infidel democratic regime that is based upon 
   separation of religion and state and on ruling the people
   by the people via legislating laws that contradict the
   way of Allah and permit what Allah has prohibited. This
   compels the other countries to act in accordance with the
   same laws in the same ways� and punishes any country [that
   rebels against these laws] by besieging it, and then by
   boycotting it. By so doing, [America] seeks to impose on
   the world a religion that is not Allah's�" 

   "America, with the collaboration of the Jews, is the 
   leader of corruption and the breakdown [of values],
   whether moral, ideological, political, or economic
   corruption. It disseminates abomination and licentiousness
   among the people via the cheap media and the vile curricula."

   "America is the reason for all oppression, injustice,
   licentiousness, or suppression that is the Muslims' lot.
   It stands behind all the disasters that were caused and are
   still being caused to the Muslims; it is immersed in the
   blood of Muslims and cannot hide this." 

I'm sorry, what's that you were saying about it not being
about religion?

Wake up.
