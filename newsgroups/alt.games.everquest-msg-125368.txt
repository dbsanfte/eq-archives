My girlfriend (who doesn't play eq) lives about an hour away from me
by train.  One day she was on her way over, and I was going to stay
logged in until she got there.  She called and said she was on her
way, and about 45 minutes later, I stopped myself just before typing
"/who all <hername>" to see what "zone" she was in to get an idea of
how much longer I had left.

We're having dinner tonight with a lot of friends who used to play EQ.
When I was listing off who would be there, one guy she didn't remember
until I used his EQ character's name.
