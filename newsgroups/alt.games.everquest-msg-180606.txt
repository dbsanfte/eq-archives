When I was doing my leveling to 60 (all pickup groups) it was in Sebilis.
Clerics made out like bandits here, so sometimes its hard to feel for the
clerics who really are suffering.

A good friend of mine (chanter) was pretty much broke from 1 to 65.. he
never got reimbursed for his Rune V in 99% of groups (and back then it
really was a big deal, in a zone like Seb where it lasted a fair few hits).
(He was the person who gave me my first haste item at level 49!)

I remember days when he couldn't even buy a single stack of dots (cuz he
prefered to give his friends haste items, which sold for 10x what all our
gear combined went for) and I couldn't really do much, bought the odd stack
of dots when I could.

One of my happiest moments in-game was when I could buy him a horse... in
contract a r/l cleric friend who did pickup groups from 1-60 never found
himself unable to afford dots.

He bought a stack of dots before first ever going to Seb (all of his money)
and after his first group, was never short on dot money again

Its not a requirement.  It didn't even exist when half the game leveled up.
I got to 60 without kei.. some requirement

You can get to 200 smithing for 3kPP or less.
The way I see it, the lazier you are the more expensive it is.
The poorer you are, the more work involved.
End result - the same.
