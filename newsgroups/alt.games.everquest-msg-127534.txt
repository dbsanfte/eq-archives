I'm not selling a car, I am selling the game Everquest, which the high
bidder can request my old acct if they so choose.

Prolly the person that sold the car...

I don't know, I am not selling a rental car.

LOL wow you guys amaze me on how much this game means to you.  After having
my last daughter,  I have realized that I have no time to play this game, so
I am selling it, and if the winning bidder wants, he/she can have my old
acct. plain and simple.  I am wondering why so many are against me selling
the game?

Oh well, keep em commin :)

P.S. the Afganistan remark was totally uncalled for.  Apparently you have no
respect for the USA, and were completly unaffected by the tragedy Sept. 11.
I pitty you.
