Go to this website and download a program called DXWindows.
It makes it so you can run EQ in a window and still be able to check
your email and surf the web and such.

It works great. I have a friend that uses it. 
I don't need it, because I have 3 other computers I can surf the web
and such with while I play.

Bizbee and that lame Tygar and all those other people whose sphincters
are too tight can flame me all they want and call this a cheat and so
on and so forth.
I don't call it a cheat.
I call it a Utility. =)

Anyways, enjoy.
