You're projecting what you would do, and using it to determine that the

All the more room for indie games.  IF that is what people want - a 
choice you don't seem prepared to give them.  Magic The Gathering was a 
success, despite having the features you criticise.

And if people want and are prepared to pay games where use of real-world 
money is not allowed, why wouldn't greedy corporations provide them as 
an alternative?
