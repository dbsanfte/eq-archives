everyone should be alowed to say what ever you want... when every thay want
... if you read the 1st post you would see one of the things it was trying
to say "is stop the Hate". we should stop Affirmative Action. some of you
might not know what that is. it where two people apply at the same school
and B/C i'm a white American who dosen't play sports i'm the last in line to
get in. even someone with a lower grades then me is in front of me B/c there
of a another race other then white.             Warren Taylor
