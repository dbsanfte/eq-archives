    Oh, of course...
    I've been told that falling from high places is aparently some sort of
sickness that I enjoy. I was actually thinking of doing this to a character
on my own account.
    I've always loved cliff diving in this game.
    And, even though I do like the safe ones with long falls the best... The
dangerous ones get the pulse pounding... though I think my favorite is to
fall, take damage, and live, or make a very dangerous dive successfully.
    Oh, and I can safely say that you DO, in fact, loose exp if you die to a
fall... even if all the damage was from the fall... wasn't *sure* until a
recent, accidental, high-dive off of the Thurgadin waterfall.

    BTW Thank You, Verant for "The Span"  I don't think I've ever walked
down that wonderful bridge... though I have lev'd myself up to the very top
of the topmost spar (carefully, since the zone border runs all the way to
the top of the spar), run out over what I really hoped was water, and killed
lev before I decended too far...
