As someone else noted, Steamfont is where they're hooking in the next
expansion, just as Toxx got revamped before TBS and Highpass got it as
part of TSS.  Which isn't to say I disagree about the extra lag being
annoying as hell to no real benefit.  (Heck, how many people actually
use Toxx to reach TBS instead of just porting to Katta?)

That said, I do like the look of the new zones, for the most part,
especially when they've preserved the layout and other feature of the
original zones so I can still navigate by landmarks.  The Ro revamp
looked nice but was iffy; the Freeport revamp sucked.  But the revamps
of Misty and Commonlands, for instance, look pretty nice, aside from
the damned lag.

The information took a while to show up on the site, but it's up now:

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50645

The downside is that they're not running very long; slated to end on 11/4.
Of course, they were originally intended to start five days sooner, but
the San Diego fires got in the way. :-(  I wouldn't be surprised if the
events get extended a bit, but we'll see.

I read somewhere that one of the new rewards is a 10-dose SoE item, which
sounds handy for those of us who can't cast it ourselves. :-)

Yeah, 30 sounds low, but maybe some of the mobs work at that level.

I had the same problem on the machine I first started playing on; had
trouble in Swamp of No Hope, too.  But once I could actually move around
in those zones they were indeed a lot of fun.

I checked the last three hotzone lists; nope, not a repeat.

Yeah, about time they gave a tip of the hat there.  Note that this will
probably still be a hotzone when the PoP 5-year anniversary arrives next
spring.

Yeah, my druid spent a little time in DN, but getting there with my SK
was just not worth the trouble.

Hm, I haven't spent that much time in the last set of hotzones, but I
got the impression that some of the "new drops" are the same as they
were in the previous hotzones (which may or may not still drop them).
Especially the augments dropped by the "unmasked changelings".  Have
there been many other new drops as well?
