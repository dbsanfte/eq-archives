You must not really play a BL, because you have NO clue about how the
class is/was played.

Before the change your pet would zone in with you, but he would be
stripped of ALL buffs including the level buff. If you wanted his
"protection" going through the zone, you had to "Level Buff" him with
a slow casting high mana spell. If your pet died you had to resummon
with a skill. (10 seconds), then rebuff with the level buff (6-8
seconds). It took roughly 18 seconds to get a level buffed pet. 

Now you cast your pet summon spell (like a mage or necro) and get a
fully "Level Buffed" pet. The new summon spells take a less time to
cast (roughly 8 secs) and are more mana efficient. You are MUCH more
likely to channel a new pet in @8 seconds if things get ugly than @18.

The only thing BL's lost was the "gimmick" of zoning with their pet.
At the mid-high levels, zoning in with a stripped unbuffed pet is no
more dangerous than zoning in with no pet at all. Anything that will
beat you down will cut through your unbuffed (level or proc) pet like
a hot knife through butter.
