Others have answered.  I'll just add this:  You only need to type in the 
first 4 characters of the NPC's name.

If the name doesn't work, try the first 4 characters of their title.  For 
instance, if you know he's a weaponsmith, if using the name doesn't work, 
try "weap."

That being said, NQ guards are notoriously stupid, and any time they shrug I 
put words into their mouth..."I don't knoooow" in the most retarded way I 
can.  Makes me feel better and I don't wish QUITE so much that I can't 
attack and kill the idiot. :)
