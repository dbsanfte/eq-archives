No. Apparently somebody's ego has been bruised when a less than perfect
light was shone on it. Sorry for holding the flashlight, bud.

While in the past you have seemed to have such a good grasp on the "big
picture", do you ever actually *read* what you respond to? Where the
fuck did that come from?

HELLO??? Is this on? We're talking about a kited mob attacking me and my
medding/healing party. End of story. Please try to read before
responding with the shotgun mouth and alligator ears, Biz.

I'm sure there isn't on your planet.

And once again, because it fails to fit into your perception of the
world, you deny that if something attacks my party while we are medding
and healing, we should be able to kill it and take umbrage with the
*ASSHOLE* that was trying to kite it and dragged it on to me. Nice call.
