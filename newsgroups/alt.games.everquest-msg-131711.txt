I like your arguments, now can I ask you (and anybody else who happens 
to read) some questions, as our guild is quite, quite new and we'll be 
rolling for loot in a couple of days?

1) What's fairer, to let everybody who ever showed up roll for 
everything, or to let those who were there when it was looted roll for 
it?

2) What about the FBR our leader got when neither necro was there?  They 
both helped, but one brought her high-level who buffed us then had to 
run help another guildie (in another guild), and another stayed an hour 
then pointed out that where he lived it was 2am, and he had to get to 
work at 6am the next day, and left.  Additionally, there was a wizard 
there for awhile, but he left because he was too low-level to get 
experience with us there.  He can use it too, and it'd be a nice item 
for his level, but it *is* a necro epic item, and he *did* leave quite 
early.  But then, so did the two necros.  But then, they left for more 
valid reasons. :/

Note that I'm *not* the guild leader, I'm just trying to organize my 
thoughts on some ways to handle some of the more difficult rolls, in 
order to present to her an easy and fair way of handing out loot.
