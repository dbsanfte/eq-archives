I did the same on my server, didnt even konw about it before i had 120 skill
(learned pottery to make vials for my rogue), cost my wood elf rogue around 60pp
to get to 120.
Appearantly i was the first person to make them on my server (or the first
person to mass produce them) because i didnt get any competition for about a
month. I sold mine for 250pp each, price is around 150pp now, and around 20
people are making them, so the market is kinda filled. But if youre one of the
first persons to sell them, you can REALLY make a profit.
