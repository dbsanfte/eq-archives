It is :)

You just need to form new habits, that's all. I tend to get confused
when in wolf form, since the wolf head is higher when sitting than
when standing :) 
And as for changing out spells - do you really need to change them all
that often? I have two meditation related hotkeys: Sit and Spells, use
them accordingly, and don't ever see that 'second or two' difference
you seem to have.
