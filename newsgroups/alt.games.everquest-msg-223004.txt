Agreed, on my monitor they are very, very different, but the slightly 
lighter shade of the dark blue con is MUCH easier to see now.  The light 
blue still isn't light blue, it's Cyan, and far closer to white than the 
DB con colour, even after the change.

Sounds like a contrast issue on Greg's monitor.
