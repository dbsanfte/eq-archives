Sabretooth ,
There is no better time to start archery than at low levels as the skill
raises slowly. unlike other melee skills this one only can be used when your
target is some distance away.  invest in a fletching kit. put some training
points in fletching and buy the cheapest components available -- wooden
point (6cp) -- wooden shaft (6cp) -- round cut fletching (3 sp) -- large
nock (6cp).
 put one of each in a fletching kit and clikc COMBINE each successful
combine will give you 5 arrows at first it may seem expensive but its a
great way to pass time while waiting to heal.
