Any time you post a "thou should doest what I hath dunnest" message it's a
troll.  Sorry, but them's the rules.

Anyone with half a brain knows that if you do not play responsibly then your
life will go to hell.  Anyone with half a brain will not blame EverQuest but
will instead blame themselves for being weak.

You're not telling anyone here anything we didn't already think of.  You're
pissing in the wind.
