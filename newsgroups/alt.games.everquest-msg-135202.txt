When clerics summon food, they get this bread that has a blackish crust
that looks kinda burned.

Actually, it is a very rich and nutritious bread.  And it goes well with
halfling toe jam. :P

I think it's the same "summon food" that shaman, druids, and I think mages
get.  So it's really not cleric-specific.
