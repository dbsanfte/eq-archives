You mistranslated.  It's not a prophecy, it's just another sad
example of the arrogant and self-serving nature of group-think:
"There is not enough roleplaying, therefore roleplaying is wrong."
What a crock.  It's just a another veiled form of "You must do as
we say because we say so, your interests are of no concern to us."
