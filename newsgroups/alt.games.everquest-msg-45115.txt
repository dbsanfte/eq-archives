Having no information on said reliable sources, I can't comment on that.  I
have been running both NS and IE on an NT 4 SP6 system, both have different
but equal problems.  IE crashes on some websites, NS on others.  I use IE at
home on Win2k, haven't tried NS there, mostly because IE is already
installed, and works, so I see no reason to change.  I don't want to see
TuxTrainers website badly enough to switch browsers just for that purpose.
