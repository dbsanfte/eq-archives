Actually on behalf of the hardcore roleplaying nutjobs I would like to
respond with a firm "no".  Immersiveness had already been destroyed long
before this concession to the number crunchers, in fact long before
spell specs were visibly listed, heck just long before.  Actually, so
long as a game allows those not interested in immersiveness to
participate it may well be impossible to maintain.  Suspension of belief
will only outweigh a certain level of incongruous behavior and it takes
but a few to sway the masses in such a manner as to make immersion
completely impossible to maintain.  

When a developer first realizes that in order to create a truly
immersive game they will have to take an active role in dissuading those
who would shatter the illusions, that they will have to sacrifice some
of their potential user base in order to meet the needs of the intended
user, then there will be potential for immersiveness and not before.  So
long as developers pitch the lowest common denominator and attempt to
create the largest user base we all will  have to live with imperfect
games.
