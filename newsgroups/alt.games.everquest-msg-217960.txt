Aye, with TheVision[tm] we had something to rail against [certain
details of] and to criticize [certain details of].  Nowadays,
there's no there there.  The game has no backbone anymore, it
isn't so much instanced dungeons that have destroyed the feeling
of playing in a world, but rather the lame, contrived, excuses for
one fundamental change after another to the flavor of the game.
It's pretty sad, imo, when your backstory is less compelling than
The Legend of Zelda.
