I got tired of the flames and allegations on our server board (where the
mods (and I) don't want them) so in a fit of following my own advice to
someone, started up yet another ezBoard.

* Multi-server (one forum per server)
* Not moderated (though threads should be to the subject, threads about
flower arranging will be tossed)
* Just remember the guy you're pointing a finger at has fingers of his own.

It may well end up just being either a big flamewar, or a barren desert.
Either way, the people who want a place for it can find it.
