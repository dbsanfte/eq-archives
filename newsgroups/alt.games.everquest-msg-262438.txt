To be honest with you, I think the problem they're trying to solve is PoP,
and the huge equipment gap between raiders and non-raiders.   The newcontent
that they wanted to release couldn't be balanced properly, because it would
either be trivial for raiders or impossible for non-raiders.

GoD tried to adress this issue by returning to the same theory that created
the problem.   They made a small non-raid area, then made the "raid
equipped" areas require flags that are very hard to obtain, specificly Vxed
and Tipt.  The result being probably thier least popular expansion so far.
Non raiders didn't have access to a huge portion of it (again) and couldn't
survive in the raider areas even if they did get there somehow.   And there
*still* was no way to bridge the gap between the two, other than "Join a
raiding guild and start raiding."

I think the attunable drops were meant to bridge that gap.  To give
non-raiders a way to get equipped enough that they could survive in the new
zones.  In order to do that, they've needed to give up the war on twinking.
They're not ready for a complete surrender though, which is why they
"borrowed" WoW's idea of 'no drop after equipped' items, to slow down the
process.

They probably hope that the attunable tag eliminating hand-me-downs will
keep the new gear somewhat rare and extremely pricey... so that it's very
much in the interests of the non-raiders to take thier single group out and
kill the named, rather than just buying it dirt cheap.  As well as slowing
down twinking, as previously mentioned.

No idea how it will work out... but I do agree with them that they had to do
*something*.
