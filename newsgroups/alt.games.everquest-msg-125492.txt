Well, I'm a Ranger, only level 13 - and when I coupled with a Bard it worked
out really well - as far as the best coupling I've been with.

Granted I'm a super-newbie.  But I was surprised at how effective I was with
the Bard helping out.  It worked out well because both classes are hybrids,
but they're complimentary hybrids.  If I had someone who I could play with
consistently I would tell them to be a Bard.
