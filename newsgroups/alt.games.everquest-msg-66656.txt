Of course we are beta testers of a sort....  who would truely have it any
other way?  A beta tester gives input to enhance the overall game.
Technology is always changing and for the game to remain static would not
only be boring, but would become obsolite.  By using our ideas and feedback,
the game producer's, designers, and in game assistants can better understand
US, the players.  A game that ignores the players is destined for failure.
True, many of us have recommendations, griefs, or all out BITCHING, but as a
whole, something must be going right, because there sure are a lot of EQ
addicts out there.

BETA TESTER?  Call it what you will...  count me in.
