No problem.  I actually do it myself with gear I'm wearing since
someone mentioned the
price-it-high-if-it-sells-replace-it-and-keep-the-change strategy.
But *derv rings*.  *Ruined pelts*.  At least have the dignity to try
and price SCHWs at 10k or something.  Besides, I have much funner
reasons to laugh at you. :)
