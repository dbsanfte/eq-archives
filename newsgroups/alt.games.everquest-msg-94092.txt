Thanks very much.. I was thinking about buying a wrist brace and wearing it
at night... my sister had a similar problem (only it was caused by
riding/grooming horses, not computer stuff) and she had to wear a brace for
a few weeks.  She only wore it though while she wasn't working.. never while
she was working... which makes sense I guess.

Anyhow.  Thank you very much for the insight, I'll try some alieve and get a
wrist brace to wear at night for a few days at least to see if the symptoms
start to go away.  :)
