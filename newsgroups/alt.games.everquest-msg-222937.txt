Supposedly, quite a few patches ago, they made pets resists match their
owners I think. If that's the case, loading yourself up on resist gear
should help the situation. Am I misremembering this change or was it
mage pets only?

Other than that the only reliable way I can see is your idea of using st
mez to stop them casting. It may be messy but I've seen enchanters do
the same thing on non-stunable mobs that want to gate. Turning on spell
graphics so you can tell when they're casting fear would help if you
don't usually have them on. I also have my "other spell casting" colour
in the chat window a brighter colour than the default for timing stuns.
