I like the attitude of immortalizing and romaticing the GMs to some god
status but you forget one thing...
This is not a MUD. No, EverQuest is not run by the GM's or guides. They are
just doing their job they are paid for. (Umm.. GM's get paid right? not
guides?)
In MUD's this analogy goes quite well as the maintainers are _gods_ and
_owners_ of the place. People who devote their time for _nothing_ to make
the game a better place.
However, i pay to play EverQuest and i have the right to bitch if i some day
dont like it. No, i dont do that out loud because most people (like me) hate
when people just refuse to go away and hang around bitching.
Sooo.. No, i dont think a GM can ban you for bitching about the product.
(Well, they can push the button but i believe the ban would be promptly
lifted when you start your own crusade with some customer protection
authority.)
