Yes, you did, but if you go browsing through some of the dsl newsgroups, you
will find that rather consistently the people having problems with the
inexpensive routers are the people who have Linksys routers.  It is often
not a difficult issue to work out, if you have the technical skills to do
so.  Sometimes it's a matter of upgrading the firmware in the router,
sometimes it's a configuration issue.  The people with Netgear routers, and
some others, by and large, do not have these issues.  When I purchased my
router, it was somewhat more expensive than the Linksys equivalent, but,
given my research, seemed worth the moderate additional cost.
