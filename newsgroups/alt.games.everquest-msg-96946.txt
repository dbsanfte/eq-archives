It sounds like the kid is saying "Daddy, don't get us in trouble"
because he (the kid) doesn't understand what's wrong with the
names being rejected.

I have to admit that I don't really see why a name with "sing" or
"song" in it would be rejected either.  I can understand the kid's
confusion.

And if Verant would threaten suspension based on that, the kid
probably doesn't know what else Verant might threaten suspension
on.

Neither do I actually.

I believe Verant makes it up as they go along.

6 months ago, the TOS said NOTHING about suspending an account
as a result of repeated attempts to create a character name.
How do I know?  I got suspended for attempting to create a character
name (8 times) and the TOS said nothing about multiple attempts.
