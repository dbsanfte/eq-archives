Monkey hee, monkey ha, Patricia goes on:

>The only reason I top post is to me it's easier to read everything, I
>hate scrolling, down down down to find the message.

That's why God and/or monkey descendants made the Delete key. It
banishes all irrelevant text to an early grave in an immediatelike
fashion. Supoib.

>I don't care how anybody does it, just stop freakin' getting pissy about it.

Yes, it's tragic when people get annoyed about something not worth
getting annoyed about, isn't it. For example, the humorous attribution
line about fish that my fine friend Mr Alex Watson uses at the top of
all his posts. I can't imagine why anyone would be irritated by that.

>As for my sig, yeah it was kind of long, I changed it.

Don't say things like this in future, I can't make an ironic comment
about them.
