As my daughter would put it, "yes, sir points out the obvious a lot, I did"

And I knew before going to look at that page that a patch was going on.

And I even know, although I suspect you do not, that the stated patch 
duration is rarely accurate.

And I also know, again AISYDN, that the very UP and DOWN messages on 
that page are notoriously inaccurate, for the very reason I described in 
my original post.

In order to make the post I did, I'd have -had- to have all that 
information at my command.  It wouldn't make any sense otherwise, and it 
certainly wouldn't reek of sardonic overtones in the way it did.

It would perhaps have espoused a simplistic and uninformed and overly 
naive tone, like your reply.
