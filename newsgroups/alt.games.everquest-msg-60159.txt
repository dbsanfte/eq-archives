Pickpocketing should work as long as you have auto-attack off, and the mob
is not an animal.

You can stand there and pickpocket greens and get skill ups.  Every time you
attempt to pick pockets, there is a chance they will detect you and decide
to attack, so you need to be ready to kill it.

The funny thing is that can pick-pocket anything the mob would normally
drop when you kill it, like "You pickpocketed a patch of gnoll fur".  
Don't ask where that came from!

The downside of pickpocketing greens is that it's kind of boring.

When you are meleeing, you can use a hot button which turns auto-attack off,
does a pickpocket attempt, then turns auto-attack back on again.  It's a good
way to practice pickpocketing when you want to deal with something higher than
greens.  However, if you are fighting in a group, ask the other group members
if it's ok to do this... because they may not appreciate you taking the drops
secretly.  You can figure out some way of splitting up the loot after the kill,
like keeping track of the coin and splitting it up, and rotating the items to
each player.
