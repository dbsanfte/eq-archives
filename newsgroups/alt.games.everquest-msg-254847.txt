I would have waited a couple more minutes for the afk 2nd tank. If he hadn't
come back  I would have bailed then. If he had come back, I would try a
couple more pulls. If it goes south again, THEN I would have "gracefully"
left, probably using the same or similar excuse as the MT did.  When I get
into a really bad group, I don't like to say or imply, "you all suck, I'm
outa here".  Most likely, some of the other group members weren't bad
players and I don't want a bad rep with them by bailing on a group and
leaving with a nasty message.  I've been in groups where someone bailed and
left a nasty message about someone or the group as a whole. Many of the
remaining players would put the one that left in a "moron list" and so as to
not group with them again, and to tell others not to either.
