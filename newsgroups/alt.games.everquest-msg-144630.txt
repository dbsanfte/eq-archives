}As I had understood, they all stack as long as there is only one of
}each.

Yes, but some bard songs, I'm led to believe, do -not- stack with chanty 
or shammy haste.  It's only a few of the higher ones that do.

}I have a friend that we are in a debate, he says that :
}He has a FBSS and when he is buffed by an enchanter (level 59 or 60 I
}cant remember) and he takes off the FBSS there is no difference...
}It is in his mind that they dont stack.......

Well, given just FBSS and chanter haste, he can't be hittig his haste cap, 
(100% total haste) so that's not it...

}So, what is the real low down... and if at all possible could you
}refrence a source for your information, so I can guide him to it.

Look this post up on google, and give him the URL. :)

Seriously, if you search the archives for previous discussions of haste 
stacking in this newsgroup, you'll probably have 20 hits or so.
