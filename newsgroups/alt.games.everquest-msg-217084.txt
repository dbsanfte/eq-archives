Or a Paladin.  I'm perfectly happy with a 90% rez as opposed to 96%.  
Also, it's really unnecessary, as you should not be rezzing during the 
adventure anyway.  Casters bind outside the dungeon, melee bind at the 
nearest wayfarer camp.  When you die, you run back in, loot all but one 
item, and keep going.  At least, that's the way I usually do it.  
Afterwards, I find someone to rez me and anyone else that needs it.
