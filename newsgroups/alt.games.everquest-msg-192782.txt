I went to Cazic-Thule with a full group and a few other people. Due to the
fact that most of us were way below any lvl where we had any business being
there (I'm a lvl 39 Magician), we stayed right inside the entrance at the
zone line and watched as a lvl 61 Ranger, a lvl 55 or 56 Monk, and a high
lvl Paladin (didn't catch his lvl) killed the guards. (This expedition to CT
was the Ranger's idea, because he needed Tae Ew Blood) The tanks had high
lvl Druids healing them during this.

While we were there, I was given two Bloodstained Journals (vols 3 and 4)
that dropped off the guards.

I couldn't find any info on these books at Allakhazam's, but did see someone
else selling vol 3 for 75pp in the Bazaar.

Does anyone know what these books are for?
