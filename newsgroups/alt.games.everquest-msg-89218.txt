Yep -I have found that a beastlord who knows how to control his pet groups
well, and I once grouped with another Beastlord to great effect. One of the
other effective duo's was with a Wizard. I would do the pulling to my
stationary fido and Wizzie, he wouldn't even need to stop medding on
singles, hardly anything on doubles but he really shone when the pull went
bad and firepower was needed as of yesterday ; )

Thanks a heap for the info : )
