The tutorial does seem to have some hiccups.  (See other thread
where the OP from this thread mentions a character being able to
go around in the tutorial but not getting any of the voice-over.)

I've started one new character since the tutorial went in, and it
mostly worked fine.  (And I love that charm! my older characters
are all jealous because their charm slots are still empty!)  But
when I first created the character and said to enter the world, my
client crashed.  I fired it back up and entered, but the tutorial
button had turned itself off in the meantime so I entered my home
zone instead.  Camped, clicked the tutorial button, went back in.
Everything was fine, except I'd apparently missed the first part
of the tutorial "story line", where (I've since been told) I get
to kill a mob to get the key to free some guy.  I didn't realise
I'd missed anything until partway in when I tried to do the
Merchant part of the tutorial and couldn't because I didn't have
the shackles I was instructed to sell.  (Some nice chap bought a
pair and gave them to me so I could sell them. :)

I wondered if maybe the part I'd missed said what to do with the
gold token, but I guess not.  I do know that, while I was there,
someone else was asking for a gold token so she could do some
quest involving the banker, but I don't know what she was talking
about.  (I don't remember the tutorial text for the banker; does
it instruct you to take the token out of your bank?)
