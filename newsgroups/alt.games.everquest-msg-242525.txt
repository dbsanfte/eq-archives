First of all great initial post.  Unfortunately seen it all.  One thing that
was left out.

A lot of times especially in a guildy group we would have a necro pull.
After all, after 3 or 4 DoTs and pet, what else is he going to be doing?  :)
Naturally the necro pulls with snare/DoT.  So naturally that mob will be
incoming slow.  If there is an add, that one will be incoming fast.
Naturally, I can't mez the DoTed one.  I would like to live.  So I mez the
fast incoming one, which reaches camp first.  Mind you, this is after
everyone knows the necro is pulling.  Plonk, first mob standing there
drooling on himself.  Bam, so-and-so melee breaks mez, I instinctively stand
up and start recasting Arcane Rune and spamming mob is mezzed key.  Dammit
if everyone is supposed to assist MT, and MT is not pulling, that MT better
be assisting puller.

And if the mezzed mob is ready to be killed, it better be woken up by some
taunter.  Don't let me see a monk or rogue wake up the mob and have it make
a beeline to me.  Thankfully by then the mob is already slowed, but still...

As for the nobody else in back of the mob....  Good point.  Except I hate
ripostes.  Especially anything in the planes, or any Fabled worth killing.
So if no rogue, fine, I'll stand directly in back of mob.  If we do have a
rogue, I will stand towards the back but off to the side, enough room for
the rogue to do his thing, and for me to not have to worry about the mob
dodging/riposte/block etc.  It works well.  Monk gets his BS's off, and my
monk has increased DPS as well.
