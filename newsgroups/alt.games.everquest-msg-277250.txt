alt.games.everquest2 exists now as was mentioned earlier, plus the 
official forums are quite good (www.everquest2.com) and if you search 
around, a number of other forums.

While it has it's problems, and competition from World of Warcraft, I 
feel EQ2 has started to settle into being a decent game and definitely a 
heavy-weight in the gaming genre now. It feels much less like EQLite 
than it was when it began, even dragged me away from WoW which was quite 
addictive.

So in short, no, it's definitely not evidence the game isn't doing well.
