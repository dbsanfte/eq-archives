I looked again and the older version of OE I use here at work has only the
"indent with >" option.  I will have to look on my up-to-date OE I use at
home and see if this option is present.   Don't tell me to upgrade OE here
at work because that won't happen until I can score a new machine as this
one is notorious for giving me a "windows protection error" (A.K.A. blue
screen of death)  when I try to upgrade anything.   sigh
