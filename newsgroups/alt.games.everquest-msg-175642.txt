Nope.  I do think it's reasonable to expect you to say what you
mean, instead of something else.  Your second clarification reads
far differently than your original story.

Of course I find fault with it.  It is only ever necessary to "cover
other's weaknesses" (or your own, for that matter) if you've fucked
up or been caught off-guard, and then it's a delaying tactic.  Doing
so cannot defeat your opponent, someone or something else will have
to defeat your opponent and save your ass.  What's always effective
is to use your strength(s) to defeat your opponent's strength(s).
The trick is to figure out what that means in a given circumstance
(i.e. head-on confrontation is only one of many possible strategems).
When you cover a weakness you are wasting effort that should be going
towards defeating your opponent, if you are using your strength(s)
effectively your weakness(es) become irrelevent.

> and exhibiting "good gamesmanship"??


"Good gamesmanship" has been used to mean a variety of different
things, some not so good.  It conveys no information to me.

Well, at least we're agreed on something  :)

Well, I have now tried to fix that part (no, I am not attempting to
imply that my contribution was shorter than yours, heh).
