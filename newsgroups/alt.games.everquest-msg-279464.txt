A wise man once said, ok, a white rapper, but still, "Where it is usually
depends on where you start."

Doing raid progression, where the upper limit *is* much higher, means you
will get the mid-level, or "high end single group equivalent" stuff much
faster, but that's because you're on a much longer path.

To put it another way, you just stopped running the 100 meter dash and
started a marathon, and are celebrating because you just passed the 100
meter mark.

I'll repeat this here, as it applies even more:

To put it another way, you just stopped running the 100 meter dash and
started a marathon, and are celebrating because you just passed the 100
meter mark.

Or to put it yet another way, I *passed* on this item this past weekend (I
thought it would look better on a rogue, I'm silly that way):

And what happens when you go looking for single-group accessible augments to
put in those two empty slots?

This:

LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO TRADE
Weight: 0.7 Size: SMALL
Slot: NECK
AC: +14 Dex: +12 Sta: +10 Wis: +11 Int: +11 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: +12
Disease Resist: +13 Poison Resist: +13 HP: +195 Mana: +100 End: +100
Classes: All Classes
Races: All Races
Slot 1: Type 7 - Sapphire of Focused Fortitude
Slot 2: Type 9 - Azure Stone of Infusion

And that's if you're lazy and just stick with buying from DoN vendors rather
than going for the better augs available from single-group accessible
content.

This might be a good time to mention that, for hitpoints at least, your
Time-acquired "will remain Uber for at least another six months" item just
got beat purely by DoN vendor farming.  I didn't even bother to check
whether there was a better DoN vendor neck piece available, as I know of
plenty of single-group acquirable 100+ hp neck items as alternatives to
start from.

And it didn't require a guild coordinating for months to access Time, then
however long it took to actually learn the events, and execute the events,
to get your item to drop.

Is your item better?  Hell yeah, the AC difference is fairly large.  But to
think it required *solely* "2/3rds of a month's dkp" does not give credit
where credit is due, nor does it take into account the *actual* time
and effort requirement to acquire the piece.

Nobody?  Back when naked server transfers were the norm, it wasn't uncommon
at all to find naked characters in Rathe Mtns mowing down hill giants.  The
key phrase, though, was "with any level of equipment".  I don't expect to
inspire someone to go try it naked, I expect anyone desiring to do such a
thing will start with their current gear level and build on it.   =P

It was simply designed for level 70s.  It was brutal for level 65s of any
gear level, and the raid encounters even moreso.

There is no further progression for single groups in GoD past Tipt/Vxed,
charm or not.  You beat Tipt/Vxed (and the four sewers) and you have access
to KT, Ikkinz and Yxxta.  Anything further is *pure* raid content.

I have an in-game friend who still regularly 3-boxes the Tipt/Vxed entrances
with, you guessed it, his enchanter doing the bulk of the work.  I remember
the nerf, and I remember doing Vxed/Tipt with an enchanter after the nerf
and adjusting to the difference but still deciding that the enchanter charm
was worth it.

Anywhere that I can 2-box, without slow, no matter what my gear level,
should be doable by a group that has a clue, no matter what their gear
level (within reason, again understanding the concept of "place").

It was because they were an "in your face" melee class, that with proper
twinking could actually solo semi-efficiently, which was unique (and yes,
fun).  Back then, they were easy to overtwink with a fungi and a tranquil
staff.

Maybe your elemental gear was much better than mine.  Hell, probably was
since that gear was part of the monk nerf.  I didn't wear much of it, and
replaced it as soon as possible, as it was utter crap.  The DoN gear blows
*my* elemental gear out of the water.  Just based on hitpoints, as the
easiest to compare and equally useful to most all classes (that may be a bit
of a raid-centric viewpoint due to the massive AEs that hit everyone that
are common on raids), DoN gear can match elemental gear and approach, and
beat, Time gear, as seen above.
