Yeah, if you're already level 45 the chances of getting that high
(pre-buffs) by simply stumbling across stuff before level 50 or so is
probably a little low.  The trick really is to start looking at loot in a
new way.  If you're playing a warrior you're used to looking at the first
stats and ignoring the end.  But hell, if you're going after Naggy then FR
is more important than AC (I hear...I don't have a dragon-capable melee) and
easily more important than DEX or AGI.
