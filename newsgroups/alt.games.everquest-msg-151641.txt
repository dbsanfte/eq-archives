    Actually, and I can't vouch for the rest of the guild - 'cause I don't
know.  I've only spoken to him *once* in the month+ he was booted from the
guild...   And that was the night before last.  He trained our entire party
the night before, and I didn't say a word to him.  I was to ticked off and I
knew if I did, I'd have said something that he could then turn around and
get me banned or suspended for.  I only replied when, out of the blue, he
sends me a tell saying "WTF is your problem?"...  This just floored me... MY
problem??  He's the one that can't leave well enough alone...  But even
then, I carried a civil tone.  And, after I realized there was just no
reasoning with him, I went back to silent old me...  and my guild knows
me... If I'm talking, I'm fine... If I'm silent, I must be pissed about
something.
