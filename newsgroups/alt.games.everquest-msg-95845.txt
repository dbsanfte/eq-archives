They are very close in stats. I would say sell both if you can get
enough to upgrade more significantly, else sell whichever you can get
the most for. All other things being equal, use the crafted.

Agree totally for sub-1300ac warriors

Insert large gap here

>5 +MAGIC resistance

Magic resist has an inate bonus for warriors, but is counted ni a lot of
the resist check you'll face (most obviously, resisting fears)

Insert small gap here

>10 + Disease and Poison
>6 +FIRE and COLD

Buff resists in this order:
Disease, fire, cold, poison

Why? 
Poison is trivially raised by DMF, and the few zones with DMF disabled
(no lev) rarely have poison spell attacks
Fire and Cold are common to find resists items, and Fire attacts are
more common than cold.
Disease is the basis for most slow spell attacks, which is disasterous
for a tanking warriors. It's also the least buffable and hardest to find
resist items for.

>7 +AGI

Get it over 100, then forget about it. The amount of AC you recieve from
agi over 100 is negligable on a warrior, and you'll generally build it
up anyway by focusing on AC/Sta/Hp items

>8 +STR
>9 +DEX

Forget these entirely when looking at items. Provided you can carry your
armour, and dex is over 100, the perceived changes on your stat screen
are actually so minuscule in effecting gameplay, it's not really worth
considering them


Once you get around 1300ac (yeah, I know...) there's some benefit in
shedding ac for hp (ratio of 1ac = 10hp generally works), but until
then, AC actually has an effect.
