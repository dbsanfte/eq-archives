You are quite right, of course; I must have been in a more rotten mood when I wrote that
than I realized. (EQ has been *very* frustrating for me lately; it's probably time to
play my necro for a month or two - no one asks necros for anything, except money from
time to time. /grin) That was a harsh response. Not everyone does that kind of thing and
that was a compilation of worse case scenarios. Most people who play are polite souls;
most people ask nicely for ports and don't press the issue if you say no. But not all of
them by any means.

The point remains for those who feel getting a bind is simply a waste of their time: if
you don't get a bind because you don't want to deal with the downtime involved in finding
one, I think it's rather unreasonable to expect a complete stranger to increase *their*
downtime (sometimes dramatically) to bail you out if you get in trouble. If you're
willing to accept the consequences if the worst happens, that's up to you and not a
problem for anyone else; but a lot of people playing aren't like that.
