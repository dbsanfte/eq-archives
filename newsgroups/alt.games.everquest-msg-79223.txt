We are a small group of adventurers from Northern Europe and a few from 
the United States. Because we're so small in numbers, we aren't able to 
do any big raids, and this is the main reason we want to join. We 
haven't got anything to offer new members, so we are looking to merge 
with another guild.

We aren't interested in joining one of Morell Thules UBER guilds but 
would like to join a fairly small Guild who we can help build up a 
larger guild. Most of our active players are 30+ (58 and 54 druid, 55 
warrior, 54 enchanter, 51 mage and wizard, 45 cleric and bard, 31 bard 
and rogue, and others not mentioned here)

Also we have a well-working website (www.aeries.dk) where guild members 
have their own community. This we would very much like to adapt to the 
new guild if you do not have a website or want to use ours. As for the 
name, we of course would like to keep it, but it's definitely not a must 
for merging with another guild. If you want our name, great. If not, 
we'll be perfectly ok with that too. At the merging, our Guild Leader 
will step down from the post as Leader.

There are a few requests that we have:
- At least 2 officers (I myself have two accounts and would therefore 
like to have an officer on each account as it makes it a lot easier for 
me to reinvite my chars). Of course we will respect your invite rules 
and also obey them when it comes to inviting new chars
- Permission to invite all previous members from our guild, regardless 
of levels (this includes their alts too)
- Though we will probably attend most of the raids anyway, we don't want 
to be forced to participate in a certain number of raids every week or 
month. This is not to say that we rather do not want to do raids, 
believe me when I say we will. It's just that sometimes you want some 
time off to level your characters instead of raiding.

Please tell us about your ideas about this merge and if you're 
interested.

You can contact me on Morell-Thule by sending a tell to one of the 
following chars:

Seirea, Aeries, Silvanoshei or Sharena

Of you can send an email to seirea@sorvin.123.dk
(remove numbers to write me)

-- 

Seirea Shadowhart (Druid of the 54th Circle of Tunare)
aka Aeries Silvarlight (Mage of the 51st Circle of Magic)
aka Silvanoshei Starbreyze (Cleric of the 46th Circle of Brell)
Guildleader of Knights of Arcane Lore, Morell-Thule
