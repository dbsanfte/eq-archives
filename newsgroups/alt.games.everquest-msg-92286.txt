Yeah, I must be VERY WRONG. So VERY WRONG that this is the first time you 
have bothered to type out a full sentence(although, having seen it, I would 
avoid constructing sentences too if I were you).
 
> Stupidass

I am stupid? Let's see, I:
a) trim replies
b) use polysyllabic words
c) can type entire sentences

...which is more than I can say for you.

So please, explain to me the math that makes staffing customer service to 
the gills 24/7 economically feasible. 

Let's hear it, short-bus boy.
