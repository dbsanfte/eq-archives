  KASISI, Zambia - Eighteen years after famine killed a million people =
in Ethiopia and triggered massive international aid, malnutrition, =
disease and starvation are stalking more than 16 million people in =
southern Africa, the continent's ``bread basket.''

  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, already have died, and if the world does =
not respond quickly, the World Health Organization says, 300,000 people =
could perish from hunger-related illnesses before March's harvest of =
corn, the region's staple food.

  For the first time, AIDS has taken center stage in a hunger crisis, as =
thousands of infected villagers are too weak to till their fields. =
Cutbacks in government-run health and agricultural programs, often made =
at the behest of Western lending agencies, have left many small farmers =
more vulnerable to the free market and many villagers unable to afford =
treatment for illnesses spawned by hunger.

  ``The intensity of this crisis is increasing faster than we ever could =
have expected,'' said James Morris, the United Nations special envoy for =
humanitarian needs, who says southern Africa is the scene of the =
``largest humanitarian crisis in the world today.''

  Hunger haunts much of the continent -- but that was not expected to =
happen in southern Africa. The region used to be an oasis of relative =
peace and plenty in a continent plagued by war, corruption and feeble =
governments. As recently as three years ago, the region was able to feed =
itself and export grain, tobacco, sugar cane and other agricultural =
goods to the United States, Europe and other African countries.

  That sounds pretty damn bad, maybe the anti-christ should fly there =
and fix everything for them

  Now, humans and nature have conspired to create a catastrophe there =
without easy solutions. Back-to-back droughts, compounded by disease, =
corruption, foolhardy economic policies, misguided nationalism and =
government mismanagement, have crippled agricultural production in six =
nations: Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. =
And in Angola, a 27-year civil war has ended, but tens of thousands of =
returning refugees have no means to cultivate their devastated land or =
buy food.

  Offers rejected

  In Zambia, mistrust of Western biotechnology prompted the government =
to reject offers of genetically modified corn from the United States, =
even as millions starve. In Zimbabwe, the government has thrown hundreds =
of Africa's most productive farmers off their land in an effort to end =
dominance of land ownership by whites.

  In southern Africa's last major famine, in 1992, ``you were dealing =
with Mother Nature,'' said Brenda Barton, the chief information officer =
for the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) in southern Africa. ``Now you are =
dealing with Mother Nature, economics, politics and AIDS.''

  This corrosive combination is gnawing at the twin pillars of African =
society, the family and the village. As parents die of AIDS and other =
illnesses, young orphans and aging grandmothers are becoming heads of =
households. Neighbors are stealing from neighbors. Children are fainting =
in school and dropping out to feed their families. Men, out of work and =
out of confidence, are abandoning their families. Women are turning to =
prostitution to feed their babies.

  sounds like men can be capable and trustworthy leaders and science =
will bring happiness to all mankind.

  ``It's survival of the fittest,'' said Alexander Kasenzi, the director =
of Harvest Help, a Zambian relief agency. ``All these things are not =
natural in Africa.''

  Help has been slow in coming, despite the fact that the world is =
growing more food than ever. The United States exports 60 percent of its =
food. India has millions of tons of surplus grain in its silos.

  Fewer people are being born, and more food is being grown, why then is =
the entire continent of Africa being slaughtered? Could it be that men =
have lost all regard for life and sanity?

  President Bush has vowed not to allow a famine on his watch, and the =
United States is providing 40 percent of the emergency food aid to =
southern Africa, more by far than any other country. But only half of =
the $507 million in food aid that is needed to prevent a famine in =
southern Africa has been pledged, WFP officials say.

  Early last month, officials from the United Nations, the U.S. =
government and 15 relief agencies pledged themselves to greater efforts =
to prevent a catastrophic famine -- but they remained far apart on how =
much food and money that will take.

  The world is growing weary of fighting humanitarian brush fires from =
Afghanistan to Liberia. Development aid from the United States and other =
wealthy nations has shrunk more than 25 percent since the mid-1980s, =
when the United States, the Soviet Union and their proxies battled for =
influence in Africa. Back then, the United States spent $1.2 billion a =
year on agricultural projects around the world. Now, it spends around =
$400 million.

  Most vulnerable

  ``There seems to be far greater willingness to fund emergencies rather =
than development projects,'' said Luis Clemens, a WFP official in =
Malawi.

  Because there is not enough emergency aid, WFP workers and local =
authorities in all the hungry nations except Angola have asked village =
chiefs to choose the most vulnerable villagers to get bags of cornmeal =
and other food every month.

  Southern Africa's food crisis is shredding the safety net that has =
always protected people when the weather, the governments and the =
outside world have failed them: the village and the extended family.

  The antichrist would like it if everyone were alone, vulnerable and =
controllable.

  In Matua, a village on the shores of Lake Kariba in southern Zambia, =
fishermen keep a close watch on their nets, because their neighbors have =
begun sneaking up at night and stealing their fish or the nets.

  ``This never used to happen here before. Now it's happening more and =
more,'' said Kiliford Buleke, 25, as he wrapped up his black net under a =
tree.

  ``Hunger,'' he explained, shaking his head.
