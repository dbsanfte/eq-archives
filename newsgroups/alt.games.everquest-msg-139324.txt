I have always felt that, while "Aliens" is a very good action film
indeed, and it even makes *sense* that the Company's reaction to the
creatures would end up being militaristic, it's a let-down to go from
"tense psychological horror" to "kickass blaze-of-glory action".

I would rather have seen a sequel that told the story of what happened
to the colonists, rather than the marines' discovering the aftermath
of it. It's a good film, but it lets down the essential style of
"Alien". About the only thing that's worthy is Ripley's character arc.
