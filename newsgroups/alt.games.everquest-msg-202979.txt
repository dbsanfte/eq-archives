The stamina advanatage won't matter once you hit 65 even if you have
shitty gear, being able to self buff your stamina by 90(? with PE and
stamina buff) should put anyone over the limit. The dIfference at 60
is 3hp/stamina up to 255 stamina. 

Most shaman will argue that an ogre makes the best race at 65 because
they can't be stunned from the front which makes channeling a spell
easier. Of course the ogres get a 15% exp penalty and no super regen
so they'll take a while longer to get to 65. 

>Lizard has regen going for it, but low stats for both HP and Mana. 

They do get a nice ac bonus and starting wisdom but, along with
trolls, a 20% exp penalty. Also, the handbags can't use a JBB. 

The extra regen is nice to have but not that big a deal once you get
regen items (which are getting more common) ). It becomes pretty much
irrelevant for a shaman once you get Torpor. 5 or so extra points of
standing regen is handy, but torpor is 300 points of regen when you
need it.

You used to have only 3 races that could play shaman with Barb being
the only one that wasn't evil. Since faction was a big deal back then,
lots of people went with barbs. 

Dunno how it is with the other classes but the races are balance
enough that nobody on the shaman boards really gives a damn <g>.
