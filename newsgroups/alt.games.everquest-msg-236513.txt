On warning: don't play a Necromancer in DAoC.  They solo too easy.

DAoC generally has a lot less downtime than EQ.  If you picked the worst
soloing class in the game, allocated spec points in the worst possible way,
and used lousy armor and weapons, you'd still level at a rate that would be
considered good for a good soloing EQ class.

However, after playing a DAoC Necro, leveling other DAoC characters will
seem as slow as EQ.  Without twinking or buffbots, people solo Deathsight
Necros to 50 in 5 to 10 days /played.  Since they have both lifetaps and
powertaps (steal life from mob, give it to Necro as mana), a Deathsight
Necro ends fights against mobs that would be yellow in EQ usually at full
health and full mana.  Against mobs that would be red in EQ, the Necro might
end up down on one or the other--and so then he simply finds what would be a
blue in EQ, and fills up.  And since the lifetaps and powertaps do damage
that is comparable to good nukes, these fights go fast, too.

Oh, and a Deathsight Necro is ridiculously easy to spec--keep Deathsight at
your level until 48, put anything else into whatever you want.  And since
DAoC Necros do all fighting through the pet, you don't really need good
armor.  All your armor needs are trivially met by drops.  Your focus staff
needs will be met by drops and by the rewards from the Necro Epic series of
quests.

I'm on a break now, to try to forget how fast my Necro leveled.  I played
the Necro specifically for the fast leveling, to get a 50 on my account, so
I could more easily play around with different classes (people with a 50 on
their account can start new characters at 20).  So now I just pop in every
so often with the Necro to pay rent on my house (since Necros have virtually
no equipment needs, they accumulate a lot of money...no problem buying a
house by mid 30's).  Around the time they have the new RvR stuff in, and
have retuned Trials of Atlantis, I'll be ready to come back and play other
characters, so it works out.

(Note that I'm *NOT* saying that the Necro wasn't fun.  It was a real blast
to play such an overpowed character.  I'm just warning that you shouldn't do
it first :-))
