Now thats just plain stupid to my mind. I have ALWAYS insisted that we wait
until my cleric was FM before we even entered in the dungeon. They give you
30 minutes to enter the dungeon, and the 90 minute timer doesnt even start
until the first person enters, so it makes Zero difference to wait until the
cleric actually has a full load of mana.  In all of the groups that Ive been
in Ive had no complaints from anyone while I waited to med back to full
before entering.


Heh... I take that back.. went in ONCE with less then full mana, and that
was just because a darkie group came up and started to wail on us, and we
just zoned, knowing that they couldnt follow us.  :)
