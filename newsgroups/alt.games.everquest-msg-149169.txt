Its only 12.95 a month.

If it is as you say, then there is no need to
worry, is there?

Because its against the rules. 

Simple concept, really.

I don't care if someone smokes dope, but I don't
do it myself.

 Do you understand?

Thats right, I don't care. I leave all that false
indignation to others.

Its still against the rules though, and I won't do
it.

It wasn't an insult.

Would you trust me with your character?

That's right. I don't care if someone buys an
account off e-bay, but I won't

I don't care about beggars, but I don't beg.

I don't care if someone top posts, but I don't top
post.

I don't care if people type "thx", instead of
thanks, but I don't.

I have more examples if you aren't getting the
point.

I'll be the one with the thumb on its nose.

I might also want to wait, until I know what they
are.

Of course. Now you are getting the hang of it.

Nor would I. Sounds like it might be a bit of a
challenge though.
