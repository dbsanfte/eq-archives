It's not the question whether I can handle it or nor. I can. But I don't
like it in the least. If I'm not worth the extra second to type a few
more letters than don't ask at all. I don't need a 'thx' and generally
doesn't pay attention to 'plz this' 'plz that' calls. Don't get me wrong
I'm not offended but annoyed by it too.
Everquest usually isn't that fast paced that you have to type as short
as possible. I lead raids for my guild occasionally. So I have my share
of fast paced action in chats. And things can and will get stressful.
Even then I don't resort to such abbreviations.
Maybe I misinterpret it but I read a kind of disrespect into it. Or a 'I
don't care about you' attitude at least.
