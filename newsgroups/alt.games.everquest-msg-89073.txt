  I spent levels 34-38 soloing there with my Monk: fastest XP I've 
had in a while and, as mentioned above, rarely crowded. Gotta 
love those open areas. :) 

  There are some interesting pathing problems for Mobs: the hill 
right next to the Netherbian Lair entrance always seems to have 
a Stonegrabber or Rockhoppper stuck on it, and the area next to 
the Sanctus Sera (to the right, if you are facing the entrance) entrance 
seems to be where many mobs converge in their walk along the 
zone. 

  The zone reminds me a lot of the Field of Bone at level 
7-10: a good river of mobs, just waiting for you to go fishing. :)
