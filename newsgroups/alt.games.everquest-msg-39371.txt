Runic Carver is nice inexpensive 2 hander as well as the Dark Reaver
Woe and Envy will work nicely for pierce
Ebon Razor is pretty good for 1 hand

you probably wont be able to get much ry'gorr at 22, so go banded or look
for fine plate pieces here and there

Darkforge was mentioned, but compared to the ry'gorr it falls a bit short in
some areas.... although it will suit a human quite well, just as the
sentient works for the fat errr large races ;)

hunt cazic thule for some fine steel weapons and runnnyeye as mentioned is
nice for the black alloy stuff

by low 30's you're gonna look completely different anyway, so dont worry
about bits and pieces of different armor types
