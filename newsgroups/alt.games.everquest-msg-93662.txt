My name is Chris and I guess I'll be posting here alot =)
I play on Prexus server and my main is a level 33 Bard named Vraith
Shadowsong.  How'd I get the name Shadowsong might you ask?  Well, as
soon as I got the song everyone wanted me to play it for group
invisible while exploring dungeons and being point man, I have gotten
maxed out on sense traps hehe.

Well, enough about me.  Be aware that I post in plain text but, I
digitally sign all of them with encryption as of today (Tuesday,
March 5th, 2002).  If you would like to start using encryption or if
you have ever had the problem of someone posting under your name, use
encryption so that people know it is not you making an ass of
yourself. =)

For further information feel free to e-mail me or reply to this
thread.  You must be a US citizen to use encryption stronger than
128-bits as a warning.

See all of you soon.
