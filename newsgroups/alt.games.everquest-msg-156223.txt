Some clarifications.

The back of it leads you to believe that PoP is covered like all the other
zones, but thats not true.  It has a little write up on each PoP zone, but
maps only for the first two, which seem like pretty much non combat zones.

The maps are ok.  They are not as good, IMO, as the best of best online
maps.  They dont have locs for one thing, and they just arent that big.
Also, some of them are flat out not very good, like Chardok for instance.

Overall, I'd call it a worthwhile buy though.  Its almost 600 pages long,
with lots of text, at least one page of text for every page of maps.  Lots
of background info, EQ history, etc.
