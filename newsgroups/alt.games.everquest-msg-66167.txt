I can only answer in my own case. I think it helped. Otherwise, we'd
have murdered each other over unfair computer use- as we both want to
play, and were darn near timing each other's usage. (Ok,, he played for
four hours, now I must play for 4 hours! Get off so I can play!) Now we
try to play together often, or at least at the same time.

But this is a slightly different issue from being neglected for a
computer game. If the significant other has no interest in playing, it's
very hard to get them to play *with* you.
