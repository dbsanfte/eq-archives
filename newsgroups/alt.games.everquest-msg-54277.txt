Actually, according to 2 different test posted at the Ranger Glade, it is
believed up to 20% haste with Fleeting Quiver. 6% haste with Tailored
Quiver. It is believed this is in addition to the other haste objects
(ie. Perm Haste + Spell Haste) and can give the archer a haste that
exceeds their haste cap.
