My human monk is lev 14 now.  I am bound in qeynos.  I fought in qeynos
hills for the first half of my char.'s life and bb for the rest so far.
I am in need of wu's items and cured silk armor.  I cannot find anyone
that has these items in my area which is forcing me to journey abroad.
Where is the bet place to go for me to find these items and also fight
in an area that matched my lev.  I have terrible armor and am fighting
with my hands.  I am also looking for those lightweight fighting
batons.  I currently have 150pp and hope that this is about average for
my lev.  This is my first char. and am still learning.  I have gone into
the karanas and find it hard to survive.  Between the bandits and the
other large hp creatures I find it impossible to go alone.  If I can get
somewhere with a guide and he/she gets me there where should I go taking
into consideration all of the above factors I mentioned.  I am using
duel wield and tiger claw for my attacks.  My mend skill is about lev
80.  I am so-so at fishing.

And advice would be wonderful and muchly appreciated.

Please help a newbie continue to enjoy this facinating game.
