This is still true, I have a bard on Morden rasp. The nature of bards means
I have high Dexterity, and can sing it virtually to  232 @ level 42, so I
figured I'd be a fletcher, well I went from 0 to 160 in 30 minutes and spent
maybe 150pp or so to do it. Then I thought I'd try brewing.. with my crappy
Intelligence of 89, I spent the same amount of time and found myself at 27
skill.

It still pays to have either high Intelligence or Wisdom when tradeskilling,
otherwise you're stuck with certain trades (smithing for high strength chars
and fletching for high dex chars) or a much longer and expensive time spent
learning them.

The best tradeskill toon would be, imo, a foraging enchanter...
