This is true, a 60 monk might well have quite a few of those tools.  Except
ID... are you suggesting that at high levels this becomes more than a vague
hope?

Blind works wonders, though, if you arent in melee range.  So blind mob, step
away, and boom, its off you.  It makes a massive difference in most cases, as a
cleric I had it memmed continuously into my low 50s, and still mem it quite
often while travelling now.  Very fast cast time, very low mana cost, rarely
resisted... and unlike root, stun, and fear, the other cleric "get off me!"
spells, I've yet to see a mob thats Immune to Blind.  Bio orb cast time is what,
4 seconds?  Thats very different from Flash of Light, which I can cast between
blows even with two mobs beating on me (not that it would do any good, since its
single target)

I agree, Taunt per se is utterly useless against low HP aggro.  None of my plans
were based on either the taunt skill OR the taunt like aspects of various skills
and spells.

Root, like Blind, works best if the guy you're trying to save moves away from
his attacker.  Its possible that you can move in closer than him and get the mob
off him, but I'm not sure that would work on low HP... does it?

Snare, again, is of the "run away and the mob won't kill you" class.  The fact
that its a taunt isn't really the issue I meant to explore...  this is Caer Ban
Orr time!

Doh, how could I overlook that one!

And there's DA other to consider too, a cleric AA and a bard song.

And there's charming the mob, my bard's favorite method of getting a mob off an
almost dead victim... "down boy!  Sit.  No killing Mr. Frodo.  Good boy"

Probably more out there I'm still not thinking of.
