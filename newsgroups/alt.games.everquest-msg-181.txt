X-No-Archive: yes

What is the mystery there?  It is all your headers, chief.  Yeah, stalking
for sure.  I have no idea what other news groups you post to and don't care.

I don't see how any of this pertains to your abuses on this news group or my
apparent distaste of it.  It is long-winded rationalizations of your
apparent disregard of common courtesy.

Hehe..  whining now?  I wasn't looking for your posts actually, I was
