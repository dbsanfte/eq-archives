Shamelessly stolen from the FV boards, where they stole it from a
children's book.

/steal = ON

Follow the instructions to find your new name. 

The following is an excerpt from a children's book, "Captain Underpants and
the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants" by Dave Pilkey:The evil
Professor forces everyone to assume new names... 

Use the third letter of your first name to determine your New first name: 
a = poopsie 
b = lumpy 
c = buttercup 
d = gidget 
e = crusty 
f = greasy 
g = fluffy 
h = cheeseball 
i = chim-chim 
j = stinky 
k = flunky 
l = boobie 
m = pinky 
n = zippy 
o = goober 
p = doofus 
q = slimy 
r = loopy 
s = snotty 
t = tulefel 
u = dorkey 
v = squeezit 
w = oprah 
x = skipper 
y = dinky 
z = zsa-zsa 

Use the second letter of your last name to determine the first half of your
new last name: 
a = apple 
b = toilet 
c = giggle 
d = burger 
e = girdle 
f = barf 
g = lizard 
h = waffle 
i = cootie 
j = monkey 
k = potty 
l = liver 
m = banana 
n = rhino 
o = bubble 
p = hamster 
q = toad 
r = gizzard 
s = pizza 
t = gerbil 
u = chicken 
v = pickle 
w = chuckle 
x = tofu 
y = gorilla 
z = stinker 

Use the fourth letter of your last name to determine the second half of
your new last name: 
a = head 
b = mouth 
c = face 
d = nose 
e = tush 
f = breath 
g = pants 
h = shorts 
i = lips 
j = honker 
k = butt 
l = brain 
m = tushie 
n = chunks 
o = hiney 
p = biscuits 
q = toes 
r = buns 
s = fanny 
t = sniffer 
u = sprinkles 
v = kisser 
w = squirt 
x = humperdinck 
y = brains 
z = juice 

Thus, for example, George W. Bush's new name is Goober Chickenshorts and
our own leader of the nation, John Howard's new name is Cheeseball
bubblehead (...and I had trouble taking him seriously before...!!") -spooky
how apt this little name giving can be! 

/steal = OFF
