You can med while shooting.  In fact you can med while using autofire.
(At least you could when they first added the feature)  This is a nice
option in certain situations.  If your main DPS is from archery, you
may do well to sit on a mount and med mana back for nukes.  Ranger
nukes these days can realistically add DPS to a fight and the heals
aren't so bad either.  With most healing AAs I heal for 1700 a lot and
probably crit heal for >3k maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the time?

However I usually melee these days and that means mounts are usually
out of the question.  I only use mine for traveling long distances,
recovering from a rez, and maybe occaisionally buffing a raid.

If they are playing haster and slower they may not have time/mana to
melee as well.

Mounts, I would think, are mostly useless to the knights outside of the
obvious use for traveling and possibly buffing as a Pally.

I find it hard to believe that any class would get as much advantage
from a mount as a shaman.  Druids and clerics get most of the same
advantages as the shaman but shaman also have the whole
casting-all-the-time issue.

Kiting is generally a bad idea with a mount.

As an aside, necros probably benefit the least of the casters.  There
are times when a mount is nice but they aren't that common.  Necros
feign a lot...doesn't jive well with a mount because you keep having to
resummon.  Necros also kite a lot (on purpose and in
emergencies)...doesn't work well with a mount.
