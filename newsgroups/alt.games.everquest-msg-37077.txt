Yeah, I caught that bit after I posted. If I'm not otherwise occupied, 
I wouldn't charge for a rez. But this brings up an interesting (to me)
question; do you consider druids who set up a taxi service greedy
assholes? And if you see my reply to Jakugg, I mention that while
a port can save an hour, a rez can save a LOT more time, so it makes
sense to me that clerics can demand more for their rez. Also, a cleric
can only rez one person at a time, while a druid with a full group
can make 75pp with that one port if he charges 15pp per seat...
And that one rez costs quite a bit of mana too, in my case it's
500 (resuscitate) + 225 (Celestial) + whatever buffs I throw in (the
amount of buffs depend on the tip, to be honest. Bad tippers get
Reso, anything over 30 or so get Armor of Faith and Pinzarn too.

Add all that mana up, and you're looking at 3/5 of my mana. That's
quite a bit of downtime. I doubt druids have it that bad...
