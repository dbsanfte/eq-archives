Not, realistically, if you haven't learned some advanced "tricks" that
more complex tailoring would teach you. Tricks that are highly
unlikely to be worked out without working with more complex recipes.

Think about it. In real life, it's taken CENTURIES to learn ways to
make certain products of a consistent quality. Historically, even
master smiths produced flawed products on occasion.

Also, once again, how can any rational-minded person claim that the
above isn't saying that 34% fail rate is too high for a trivial
combine?!
