I think that the market for the bags is restricted to monks at the moment.
The weight for a havresack is 0.5 versus 1.0 for a Bag of the Tinkerers. For
six of them, the difference of 3 is significant for a monk. The only lighter
alternatives are either as rare as hen's teeths or no-rent.

Other classes can buy a Bag of the Tinkerers for 5250 pp with good charisma
(131 is enough I'm told) from the npc Marfin Binkdirple in Solusek's Eye.

The halfling backpacks require, among other things, 3 blue diamonds per
attempt. Also, the trivial is above 250 so the success rate is not so hot.
At current prices for ingredients, it cannot compete on price with the B of
T.

That's why I did not consider grandmastering tailoring to make the bags. Now
if blue diamonds ever become cheap, it's another story ;-).
