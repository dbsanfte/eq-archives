I was following the Thread about the Thurg Gate potion and heard about
the Caizac Thule gate potion....

How many varous gate potions are there?
Are they all creatable by only Shamans? (what level does the shaman
need to be if so?)
What are the going rates if Shamans are the only creators?

Ive heard of a weapon or two which procs a gate... if you know of the
various weapons that do, could you list them and possibley their gate
location...

Thanks
