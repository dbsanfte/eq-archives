*indignant sniff* You clearly haven't met Foxeye, protector of toadstools
and golden ranger, else you would think rangers are freaks who need to
learn their place at a mobs butt.

I keep trying to offload the tanking role, but there's never a plate tank
around when the time comes.  This past weekend I upped my bar to tanking
636 hitters in a duo.  (That's right, Foxeye didn't need a cleric!)  Mind
you, don't put an unslowed mob in front of me...I'll run screaming like an
6 year old.
