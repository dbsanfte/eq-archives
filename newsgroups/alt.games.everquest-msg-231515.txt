I've walked out of groups, or stated I was going to, just for that 
reason before. In one case, I got ready to lead a raid because a 
particularly repulsive player suddenly showed up in our raid channel and 
it turned out a new guild member had invited them to come join us on a 
Trak kill. In most cases, the person was then booted. (including that 
raid.) In a few other, generally pickup groups, I just left. Screw 'em. 
The rest in the group will learn their lesson fast enough if the person 
is as much of a dickwad as they seemed to be when getting on your ignore 
list.
