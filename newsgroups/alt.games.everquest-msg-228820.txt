Assuming your stamina stat was over 100 (which it should have been for 
all melee) then your stamina bar was almost entirely meaningless; other 
than interfering with medding and jumping, an empty stamina bar had no 
effect at all -if- your stamina stat was over 100.

The medding part would have been a bit crippling to a cleric who was 
using melee extensively, but I don't recall my melee happy cleric every 
actually reaching OOS no matter how much he fought.

At any rate, even this small worry should vanish, and any and all 
methods used to restore stamina should be inconsequential.  If anything 
(your stamina stat was under 100, or you -were- seeing med problems due 
to OOS) this will improve your melee capability.

Since they seem to have also swapped Ultravision for stamina regen 
effects, perhaps you'll also be able to see a triffle better (unless you 
are a DE cleric already)
