As part of my preparation for the garage sale I went through all my strategy 
guides using the same kind of criteria, keeping the good ones with utility 
or just fond memories and tossing out the crap. Sold a couple. Man, what a 
difference time has made on this front. Some of these early guides were just 
fabulous, by authors who were willing to take a stand and express their 
opinions.  Books like Marc Dultz's "Perfect General II", Mark Minasi's 
"Secrets of the Wing Commander Universe" and Rusel DeMaria's "XWing". Real 
discussions of the pro's and con's of various strategies for approaching 
these games. Nowadays you get so much sanitized and wishy-washy crap ("any 
strategy that suits your particular playstyle") that is reduced primarily to 
stats and numbers and recitations of what's in the game manuals (or worse, 
what should have been). And the thing is, I bet they sell more of them today 
than they used to.
