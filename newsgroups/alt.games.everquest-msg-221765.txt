Sometimes that in itself can be half the fun. One of the most enjoyable days
I can remember was when the guild I was in did a Crushbone day on different
server where we all rolled up brand new Gnomes just for the event and zerged
away. Another time when Halfling Rangers had just been released and Misty
Thicket was chock full of them, someone made the OOC connection between
shortass halfling rangers and lemmings. Next think you know a few halflings
climb the guard tower and suicide by jumping off, a few more followed and
within 5 minutes it was raining halflings with nearly every halfling in the
zone involved (and there were a LOT that day too), I have never seen so many
bodies in the one place.

The absolute best atmosphere I have ever witnessed in a MMOG was in UO when
Seige Perilous shard opened. It was complete madness but with a carnival
atmosphere - I played 3 days straight with a sleeping bag set up beneath my
computer desk. I would just catch half an hours sleep when I could not move
another mouse click before getting back into the game.
