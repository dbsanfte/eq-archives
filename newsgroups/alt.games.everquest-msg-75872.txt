My cousin just got EQ, and we've talked a few times about what he should be
doing.  He's not having much fun with the game, and sent me this email last
week...  I figured I'd get some more experienced players' replies to his
message, since I've only had it about 3 weeks myself.

-----email-----
Basically, this is a call for ... help!  I'm not seeing the point of the
game.  I've played for 3 sittings (probably 3-5 hours in total).
Basically, it's seems like Ultima Underworld II, but w/out intelligent
puzzles and w/out a **PLOT** (!!) ... but amusingly adds a few people here
and there.  Now, mind you I'm still a few kills under making 2nd level (ie,
I'm a newbie of newbies!!), but I don't see this boredom letting up.
Help?!?  I'm not on Fennin Ro; I'm on the "Roleplaying Encouraged" guy,
because it's got more players than any other "blue" server.  PvP has zero
appeal to me.  I might as well be playing TCP/IP based Unreal Tournament DM
games and getting blown to bits by 12 years olds that have incredible
hand-eye coordination from playing console games since they were 6.  :) :)
:)  Just venting!

I'm this character:
{
-Datatroi
-Lvl 1 human
-female
-Warrior
-Agnostic alignment
-+25 to strength
}

I've done these kinda interesting things:
{
(1) One guy asked me to help him rescue his corpse from a deap water trap;
I tried and drowned
(2) A guy have me a fishing pole for free after I asked him nicely.  He
bowed to me and left.  Then I spent some time fishing and got stuff to
sell.  Pretty fun, but it'll get boring reaaaaal quick.
(3) A guy followed me around in the S. Qeynos (starting city) at the place
very near the PvP area.  I think he was waiting for me to jump to the PvP
area and then was going to fry me.  A real ass, but kinda funny.
(4) I had my 1st combat(s) above N. Qeynos w/ various snakes, rats, and
spiders.
}

Kinda fun, but can't I do all of that in Ultima Underworld or The Elder
Scrolls:  Arena/Daggerfall.  But w/ a **PLOT**.  And not $10 / month.  I
understand that teaming up to go against monsters will be fun, but it takes
waaaaaay too long to develop my character.

"Give me Nethack or give me death" is what I'm saying at this point!  But I
think I've jumped the gun...


Thanks in advance for any advice you can bless me w/,
Brian
