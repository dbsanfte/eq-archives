If I may offer some advice on that - unless you plan on riding the
front edge of the leveling curve, or have extreme patience for being
griefed, I would not recommend playing on a PvP server. Betas are not
the same as release. You didn't have the fullscale griefer mentality
going in the stress test, nor were there the guilds dedicated to that
(they probably had them in the closed beta but even then not to the
extent that is coming). The stress test was a very *very* poor
measuring stick for how PvP will turn out.

In general, for someone to enjoy PvP in WoW and games like it, they
have to be willing to accept getting killed just for walking down a
road in their own territory and then killed again while trying to get
their corpse. If you feel you can handle the frustration in that day
in and day out, then you are mentally tough enough and can enjoy the
good side of PvP (killing people who annoy you). But whatever you do,
don't think it won't happen. Most PvP in PvP games is very uneven in
the terms that you either catch someone not paying attention or
grossly outmatched and dispatch them easily, or you get ganked
yourself. Fair fights are rare. And WoW's reputation system will *not*
do anything to stop griefing.
