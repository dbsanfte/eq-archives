Currently my competing addiction is Dark Cloud.
Oddly enough, anything that competes with EQ has been
a console game.  Usually PS2.  Before Dark Cloud, it was
Gauntlet, Dark Legacy.  Before that, Onimusha. Then
Kessen and Summoner.

Always, though I return to EQ when I've finish the console
game.  Usually it's just dividing my time between them.
