That's a reasonable definition. By that definition it's excludes many of
the current residents from being productive members.
Another thing is there seems to be a misconception about FA people being
here. We/they have always been here. There are some new ones that have
come here and are going to play the game. For those that already have,
this ng now belongs to them also.
Who are these "veterans" and what war did they risk their lives in and
what country were they fighting for? There is no such thing as a ng
veteran and using that term is disrespectful to real veterans.
If you had ever been in world class flamewars, and I have and never
lost, you would know that it is not a comedic event nor it is necessary
to entertain those in it. It's a ruthless event where those capable of
interpreting the writings of others to find what is necessary to cause
them real life discomfort. Based on the fact that words do hurt. Also
based on the fact that most people do not know how to characterize
themselves through writing and expose themselves through what they write
and how they write it. The first month of a flame war is nothing more
than information gathering. This ng has never been in a real flamewar,
that is obvious to us that have. A flamewar is the game of literature,
not pretense.
Did you believe me when I said I drove a vette? The answer to that
reveals how well you will do. Can you decipher truth from fiction?
