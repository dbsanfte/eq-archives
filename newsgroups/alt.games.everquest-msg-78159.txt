Yep.  Just yesterday I person was yelling out "giving away toolboxes at
forge".  Now, being a smith myself, I know what he's going through, working
the way up.  And it was great that he was giving them away to those in need
instead of just destroying them.  I needed a pair of boxes to mule off some
stuff so I run up and request a pair.  I then paid him 60 plat for them.
The little guy was just dumbfounded.  Its moments like that, to see people
so overwhelmed by something that takes me no time to do, that really make
the game worth playing.  Chances are down the road he'll do the same when he
hears the newbie smith hawking his wares.
