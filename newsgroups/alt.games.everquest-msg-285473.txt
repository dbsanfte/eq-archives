My PC days are far behind me but here's what I recall.

Celeron will work just fine if you have at least 512MB RAM.  The
problem with the Celeron is that it doesn't have the on-cpu cache that
the other Intel and AMD's do, thus making for lower performance given
the same clock speed (I can't recall if it's floating point or not
though).  However, for most games on-cpu cache is not a big concern,
it's system and video memory that count (plus video cpu).

Now if you're relying on the system cpu to act as primary rendering
then you may have an issue.  Not that it won't do it but you will
likely not be able to have many newer models.

The original Celeron's were the shit, until Intel realized they
screwed their P4 line and "fixed" the Celeron's.  (The C's had half
the on-cpu cache but could be overclocked to 3x, making it higher
performing than their flagship P4 line at the time at about 1/3 the
price)

If you posted to component list, or a link to the system, there are
probably several people who could chime in on whether or not it would
run well enough.  Personally I think Compaq notebooks are the devil so
I'm probably not a good candidate...
