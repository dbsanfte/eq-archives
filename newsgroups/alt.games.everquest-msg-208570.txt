Roleplaying preferred... well, ideally, it's being able to stay in 
character without being mocked or derided for it (and I don't even mean 
using "thee" and "thou" and writing great big long melodramatic 
fanfic... little stuff like my Froglok *NOT* wanting to group with that 
dark elf and that shadow knight, or telling the Iksar shaman he's evil 
scum for wanting to enslave Norrath under a rule of Order and Fear).

I don't even give much of a damn if not everyone there wants to RP. 
It's the stories you hear about people BITCHING about RP on Firiona Vie 
that boggles my mind.  Like someone going to a PvP server and bitching 
about all the PvPers.  *blinkblink*

Ideally, too, with TLC, a higher-level player would "hire" a lower-level 
one to get the TLC'd item for him, but you're right in that it requires 
the higher-level player to KNOW what TLCs and what doesn't, and what mob 
that item drops off of, and such.  The /raid thing?  It may work and it 
may not (I've never used it), but it's almost certainly an exploit, and 
like KEI, may be someday nerfed/fixed.

It's nice being able to buy stuff at the Bazaar that I wouldn't be able 
to get on another server, but I'd happily give that up if the server was 
simply one-character-per-account, no TLC, normal NODROP rules, and keep 
that "roleplay perferred" tag on the server select screen.  I bet THAT 
would scare away some of the d00ds.

BTW, the Iksar shaman thing did happen... and OOCly we both had a good 
chuckle out of it.  :]
