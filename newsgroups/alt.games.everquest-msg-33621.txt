Not so much that worry, but rather it's not having the grouping
network to rely upon to get the invites in the first place.  If all
you've done until 55 is duo, it's unreasonable for you to expect
raid invites over someone that's been grouping with a lot of the
same people for possibly months.   They know what he can do;
you're an unknown.

Even inside a guild grouping has the same networking effect.
Sure, the whole guild may think you're a great guy, but having
no experience with you as part of the "team" is bound to have
an adverse effect.   Besides, the better guilds are going to
invite you after grouping a few times, not drive-by invites to
people in the zone soloing or working as a duo.   Not grouping
regularly will have an effect there, as well.
