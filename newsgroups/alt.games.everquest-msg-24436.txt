An interesting tidbit from the Big Kahoona's question and answer file.

*************
Q: Have we discovered all the continents of Norrath? I am just curious
if the entire world of Norrath has be seen or if Antonica, Odus,
Faydwer, Kunark and Velious or merely one side of Norrath.

A:  My only answer to this and the queries above is the following hint:
seek the  dragon statue, and then the globe.
*************
Huh????? Being a lowbie/midbie, whatever, early 40's player, there's a
ton of stuff I doubtless have not seen in Norrath yet, but WTF?  Any
clue as to what that means?

It's a pretty good Q&A series this time. If you haven't stumbled across
it, you can find it here:
