Graeme,
 just to let you know what can be done, i have my shield (3 pieces to the
shaman epic, shield, boots and spear), did it with my regular hunting
partners, no PL bs or anything like that.  the mobs you need to kill for the
shield are tough level 30-31's in RM, was pretty easy, warrior leaped on
them (separately of course, they are hafway accross the zone form each other
:) before i even got my pet up, went down in a minute.
was one ral close incident with a shark in erud's crossing, and the trip to
EJ  to turn in the no-rent gem you recieve with shield turned into a major
clusterfuck, always make sure the damn druid has heal memmed and always make
the group wait til you got SOME mana back after a res.

all in all, was a blast to do, makes me wish i woulda tried it earlier, and
you should see the looks i get from the people who know what i am carrying,
i never go anon unless i am busy smithing in FP
