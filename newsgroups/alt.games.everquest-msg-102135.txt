There are 2 LEGAL ways to solve this.

1. There are devices that can buff out the scratch and make the CD usable. I
suggest you get one because if you are prone to scratching CDs it will help.
Works on all kinds of CDs also. I.E. Music, DVD, Console games, Etc.

2. Contact Verant or Sony and I am sure if you send them the damaged CD they
will replace it.

Next time be more careful and don't ask people to do things illegal because of
your mistake.
