Are all these items in your examples No Drop?  The INT items, the quest
items, any items you as a higher player desire from the zone?  If they
are not No Drop then they can be purchased from those who hunt them.  If
they are No Drop does the TC prevent you from looting them from the
corpse after the appropriate level character has killed them?  If they
are No Drop but lootable if the mob has been properly killed then they
can be acquired by hiring a char of the proper level to do the hunting
and allow you to loot.  The only way I see an issue is if the items poof
if the corpse is accessed by a player of too high a level no matter how
the mob was killed.  Well I guess if you were the sort who never wanted
to interact with those smelly n00bs there would be an issue, but other
than that it seems to all work out ok.  So just how does this TC work if
a lower lvl char kills the mob and a higher lvl char accesses the
corpse?
