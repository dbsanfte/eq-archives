The problem is that, under examination, your example breaks down 
entirely. For one thing, "execution" in the case of Jesus is nothing but 
a mild inconvenience, knowing as he knew that he'd be back home for 
lunch, and back on earth in three days. Even pain-wise he got away a lot 
more lightly than most other people the Romans wanted to make an example 
of. And as for "spare us from eternal damnation", well, that's the *
omnipotent* God we're talking about. He didn't need to put his son 
through anything, he just needed to, well, just make us non-damned. Duh.

So did the Inquisition.
