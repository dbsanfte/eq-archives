went to an acredited college and graduated with my BA.  your comments make
me wonder 3 things, did you go to college / pass highschool, do you find
trying to put down others elleviates your status, and do you need a handout
(extra cash) to get laid?

I normally try to avoid flamewars, but I don't like you arguing with someone
else and then turning around to attack me.  Thus, you need to be put in your
place.
