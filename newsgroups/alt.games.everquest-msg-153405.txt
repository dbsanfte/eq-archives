This has already been suggested, and discussed.  As well as your suggestion
of cutting the power, as well as the very long pause function.
    They are not wrong, they were specifically suggested, and already talked
of as possible methods.  However, the discussion gave more than one of the
tools used.  Had the person suggested using a blade, they could have easily
been miss-understood.  Rather than giving a partial and non-specific answer,
one which could be taken in it's opposite meaning, they gave a good
description of the total thought...using a blade off of the end of an arm on
a clock to at a specific or approximate time, cut a thread suspending a ball
over the key on the keyboard, which would activate the camp (or even /quit)
hotkey.
