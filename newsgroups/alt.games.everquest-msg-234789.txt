Real currency is generally backed by a real government, not
necessarily by gold or silver but a commitment to accept it as legal
tender for all debts, public and private.  That is it's defining
quality in todays world.  Now whether that makes you feel better about
it is another story...

But the player is still responsible for knowing the EULA.  And if all
players were worried enough about whether or not the account would be
canceled they would not purchase plat in the first place.
It's a buyer beware type of thing.
