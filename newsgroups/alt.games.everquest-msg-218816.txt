Very few raid level encounters "require" defensive, and the recycle
time on the skill means that it isn't used continuously anyway. A
properly equiped Knight can stand toe-to-toe against almost anything
long enought for well timed/coordinated heals to land. Yes there are
places/encounters where only a War will do, but the number is pretty
small compared to the size of the EQ world and your choices of raid
targets.
