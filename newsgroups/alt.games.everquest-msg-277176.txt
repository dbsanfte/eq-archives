I have to agree that crafting is exceedingly boooooooooring. The only time I
do it is when I need some more player made drink.

I'm not sure what can be done about it, but one thing that comes to mind is
to make the experience and the skill increase portion of it more interactive
with adventuring. It seems to me that there should be more quests that allow
the crafter to gain experience in their chosen profession or skillset, or to
obtain recipes. Rather than have them fall randomly in whole books, it would
be nice if the recipes were obtained through quests that had to do with the
origin of the method or style.

Elven armor might require a trip to a famed elvish armorer and a subsequent
quest before you prove your worth enough for him to give you the secret to
elven armor. -or something like that-

Then you could at least increase your skills through methods less tedious
(or at the least have multiple ways of incresing them-as adventurers do) and
save the button pushing for making things you actually want.
