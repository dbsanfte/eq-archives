I've recently learned of Everquest and it sounds like a very interesting
game to get into. The only problem is that I don't know much about it. Could
anyone give me the downlow on this game? Do you have to subscribe to a host
server to play and if so how much is it or are there free servers out there
that host it? What is the best advice you can give to someone starting out?
What is the best quest for beginners to start out with? Can anyone give me
some links that can help me? Thanks guys, and sorry for the many questions I
just want to get a character started!
