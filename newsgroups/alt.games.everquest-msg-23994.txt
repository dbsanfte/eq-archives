Try http://everquest.allakhazam.com . There is a way to enter in your
character, stats, and items and it will search their database for possible
equipment upgrades based on whatever stat you are interested in (like INT).
What's great is that the items in the generated list are links to the
database so you can investigate each item just by clicking on it.
You'll need to create an account on allakhazam but that is simple and free.
Click on Login and it will take you through the process. When finished click
on "Your Characters" just under the login.

I liked this so much I actually sent them money during the last pledge
drive.
