My twink cleric lost two bags on Monday (maybe Sunday, I noticed on Monday). 
I petitioned immediately and got a quick response from a guide who, of
course, said it was something that needed to be escalated to a GM.  I then
went on a 4-hour raid with no further contact.

On Tuesday I had the day off work and so I logged on my twink cleric and
re-submitted my petition early in the day and then went afk and about my day
for the next 12 hours.  No contact from a GM, though a guide did contact me
and say they were escalating it to a GM again.

On Wednesday I logged in to raid after work and re-submitted my petition.  I
was fairly quickly contacted by a guide and, again, it was escalated.  5
hours later I logged off with no contact from a GM.

On Thursday I watched a movie with the wife and didn't log on until pretty
late and didn't stay on very long.  I did leave my cleric logged in with a
re-submitted petition for about 2 hours as I got ready for bed.  Again a
guide contacted me and quickly agreed that it was something for a GM to look
at.

Today is day 5.  I've got nearly 25 hours of waiting for a petition to be
answered by someone who can do something about it under my belt.  Anybody
want to start a pool as to when I'll finally get to talk to a GM?  :)

I went through this once before and it took me two weeks of petitioning
every day before I managed to talk to a GM.  And people worry about being
caught doing something wrong.  :P
