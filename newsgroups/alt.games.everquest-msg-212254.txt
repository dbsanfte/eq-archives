My benchmark for decent exp is an AA in under 2 1/2 hours, I got the
feeling that Torment could have hit that if we'd had an enchanter. We
spent a large portion of the time waiting for our pullers to split the
mobs

Heh, remember that you're talking to someone who's in no way uber. I
heard the same thing about loot in CoD but until recently I wore 3
pieces of loot from there. Just replaced 2 of them (skull charm and
circle toe bones) in my last two trips to ChardokB.
