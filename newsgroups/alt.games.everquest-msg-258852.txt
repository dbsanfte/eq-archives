I would imagine he rather hopes that is so.

I find it far more curious that you would find the dissemination of his 
tales as being something that should be discouraged for fear of someone 
else discovering his tactics... 

This in a game that where 99% of the other players aren't even remotely 
competing with you. (Other servers, different stages of progress, 
largely instanced content...), and the 1% that is competing with you at 
this level of the game on the same server for non instanced content 
aren't led by dribbling morons, so 95% of what is revealed is obvious or 
deducible by other guilds that are banging their collective heads 
against the same roadblocks.

Why on earth would someone feel the need to hoard their victory tactics 
in such a scenario?? The benefit is so marginal as to be laughable, 
bordering on silly.
