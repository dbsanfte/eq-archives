Actually the way it works is whoever rear ends the other is at fault.  If
that car to the right of you is half a car length ahead of you then you have
to let them in.  Around here there are still a few freeway onramps that are
mostly onramp and no length for merging, but mostly nowadays we have the
type where you parallel the main traffic for a decent distance and then the
line between you goes away.  I think they found this way has a safety
advantage so it's all they do now.
