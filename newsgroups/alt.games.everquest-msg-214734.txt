Hm, I deguilded from my ex guild...then went on a 'buffathon' [running 
around newbie zones offering free buffing in the name of that particular 
guild...not really recruiting per se, but making people assocate the 
name with nice people...] and was accused of attending just so I could 
be paid for the peridots used...despite the fact that i refused 
compensation form the organizer and in fact blew through 4 stacks of my 
own dots...or when logged into the guild's open in game chat was flamed 
by a number of people because it was for guildies to get to know 
prospective applicants and 'friends of the guld'...which by leaving 
apparently removed me from that status...or if I joined a group doing 
PoJ or PoD, the random pool of ex guildies I used to group with all the 
time bailing out on the group 'just because "she" was in the group'

And people wonder why I started an alt on an entirely different 
server...to the point of playing a race I never played before, or a 
class I never had interest in.........just to be able to get groups on 
my own merits and not be judged by who my guild was and my status with 
that guild.
