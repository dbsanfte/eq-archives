Jesus, *this* is what you find time to bitch about? Some corpses? Here's
a clue sparky, the machine described above shouldn't bat an eye at that
pile of corpses. If it is, then there's bigger problems to be looked at.

And as to why the person was doing it, I see you don't hang out with a
lot of necros. Sometimes people will let a necro "sacrifice" them down
several levels to create a boatload of Essence Emeralds, which necros
need for some spells. It kills the player and leaves them with an
unrezzable (even by a GM) corpse. And yes, when people do that,
sometimes they create a line, pile, crop circle, or whathaveyou of
"corpse art". It's kind of funny and basically harmless.

Take some exlax and get over it.
