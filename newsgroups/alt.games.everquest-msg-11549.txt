This illustrates why everyone who wants to play a warrior should
choose a large race. It's not just the special slam skill we love so
much, but strength will always be an issue. At level 39, cutting
myself down to a single weapon, my gear weighs around 110. Fortunately
for me, I am a Barbarian, I have 167 str (29 from gear, which was
chosen only for AC). You can certainly get your strength up much
higher than 108 even without any AC compromises. You can also
sacrifice some AC for +str.  Throughout the middle part of your
career, you can get some or all of the following. Crafted Gauntlets:
+5 str. Gauntlets of the Black +4 str. Orc fang earrings: +3 str.
Cougar claw earrings: +3 str. Jagged bands: 3 str. Crafted vambraces:
+1 str, crafted greaves +1 str, crafted pauldruns: +2 str. The
Treeweave is +10 str. There are a few minor AC sacrifices for plus
str, most common being the Hero bracer, 9 ac (one less than crafted),
it has +10 str. Those are just what I came up with off the top of my
head, most are items I use currently.

The high end Velious quest armour gets even better for +str, I
remember when it first started appearing trying to total up a set, it
had something like +42 str, and doesn't include nine wear locations
(ears*2, neck, face, finger*2, shoulder, cloak, or belt).
