The problem is that GoD sucks. At least for the parts that don't
require keyed access; the zones look alike, the  mobs  look alike, you
have to single pull (in most places so you don't wipe), in short -
it's boring as hell. And if by some miracle you do actually get a
named to spawn, it won't matter in any zones except for Quinimi or
Riwwi since you need a 9k tank to actually kill them. 

Given how quickly people migrated to the newer expansions in the past,
the implication that people don't do GoD because they're lazy is just
wrong. The casuals ignore GoD for other reasons.

True. Although you should probably say that the casuals don't NEED to
farm but many still do. I know plenty that are willing to waste time
on things like the shawl quests so they're often willing to do the
work. I know others that have probably never camped an item for
themselves in 65 levels.

It does when you're referring to GoD trials. Any time you're
discussing a dungeon where you have to pull singles to survive you
aren't talking about grouping skills, you're talking about having good
gear to get you through. Any halfway competent player knows what to do
when you're facing endless single pulls. 

EQ really has gotten to the point where I'd have to raid to do
anything worthwhile. LDoN are too easy, GoD is too boring, so I'm
logging on when I plan to meet friends online and basically killing
time until something better comes along. Raiding bores me and there's
nothing else left in EQ.
