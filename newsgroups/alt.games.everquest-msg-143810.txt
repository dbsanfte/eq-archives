Yep. Thank god for that. I have shut off all AA and am grinding to get
through 53 this week. Wasn't going to make it if they stuck to the date.
Then, when a get a little bit of a safety margin into 54, I'm going to
shut off regular xp and just do solid AA until the patch.

I mean, screw it. If they are going to make 51 through 53 harder, and 54
easier, I'm doing them in the opposite order. :-)
