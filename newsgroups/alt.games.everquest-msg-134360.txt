Please don't.  Seriously.  Just mark the thing read and move on.

Why?  Two reasons.

1. The people on the other newsgroup may be just as disgusted as you are. 

2. The people on the other newsgroup may ENJOY disrupting other newsgroups. 
Yes, there are groups like that.  I will not mention them by name, because
some may kiboze the newsspool and be drawn here if I do.  Posting in their
group will only give ALL of them that warm fuzzy feeling, and draw even more
attention.

Just ignore them.
