Yeah, while I agree that EQ is very addictive (as most on this board do to),
I'm sure most will move to the new games as they come out, and future games
down the line.

EQ, AC and UO have all laid a groundwork for the direction of MMORPG and one
can only assume they will be built upon and get better with new ones.  Sure
EQ is updating with new releases, but I think people will migrate to new
concepts and better solutions of common problems.

DOOM (can argue for Wolfenstien too) has a very similar lineage... it laid
the groundwork for FPS, but not too many people are buying up that game now.
One exception is that EQ will have add ons, but the basic concept will
remain the same.

Maybe, maybe not.
