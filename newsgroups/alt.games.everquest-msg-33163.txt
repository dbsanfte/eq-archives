I believe large bronze drops from the ogres in WK, but at level 17 you
might find them too tough.  I'm also pretty sure that medium bronze
drops in Permafrost.

Most people these days seem to skip bronze, frankly, and save up for
better stuff.  It's not that much better than banded, it's heavy as
all get out, and, IMO anyway, is an ugly color.

I would start buying crafted a piece at a time if I were you.  In
addition to having decent stats, it also looks kewl, which is
obviously the most important thing....
