Um...nope. reread some of the info on military religious orders...the 
clerics hit the field as did the tanks...and remember, there were a 
number of popes [Julius II was just a single example I remembered 
offhand] also took to the field.

I agree about the term templar, I was absolutely baffled as to why it 
was a cleric ranking instead of a paledin ranking. Brother as a monk 
ranking has me sort of baffled as brother/sister might be better as a 
cleric name...IRL, a vicar is in charge of a church, then brother/sister 
as monk/nun is the lowest level of fully admited order membership, then 
prior/prioress or abbot/abbess as the head of the monastary/nunery...but 
moot point as it is not likely to be changed=)
