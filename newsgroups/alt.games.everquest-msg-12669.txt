lets see "Can I plz have a pt to BB?" aside from trying to spend time being
sure i know what they are asking for, I think if they can't take the time to
spell it out they probably won't take the time to say thank you either.

so your saying computer usage is an excuse for bad language usage?

the first one.  just like someone says Bind instead of Bind Infinity.
and sorry, if you feel this way, because many of us feel this way.  If we
have conditions to helping others, oh well, no one is oblidged in this game
to help anyone and if a natural prefrence renders it's head towards somone
who takes time to spell, then it does.  If it annoys you so much, keep doing
it.  Just don't get pissy if somone refused help for it.

heheheh rather hypothetical.  lets see spelling out three words or using an
acronym or just randomly tossing together letters that manage to sound like
a word.  Man that is a tuffy.

To me it just falls in under that slang type talk i see all the time.
