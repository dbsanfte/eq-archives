I haven't noted any considerable increase or decrease, except in FV.  I
actually got an increase in performance.  I could move past the bank at
normal speed, not at fpm speeds, and this with the sky on, and clip
plane all the way out.  Granted there were only 17 people in the zone,
but i have been one of 3 before and had the fpm crap, with no sky,
particles, or any clip plane.
