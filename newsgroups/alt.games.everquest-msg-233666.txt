Sorta like complaining Star wars or Star Trek or Indiana Jones ought
to have a fresh intro song. The song says the name and the name says

Having played the original ps2 Everquest; I found finding groups a
pain in the ass. But expect no less in the land first person twitch.

Doom and we all remember how "team" oriented that was :-P
