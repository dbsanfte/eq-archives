The Black Company books by Glenn Cook.

-- 
"They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing 
round the celestial infinite with their junky little 
machines that never work properly or, when they do, 
perform functions that no sane man would require of
them and," he added savagely," go beep to tell you
when they've done it!"
                 -  from the works of Douglas Adams
