I actually like the new resists.

(1) I was PL'ing a teens char with a 34 druid prior to the resists
change.  The level 8 to 12 mobs would consistently land their spells
on the 34 druid.  After the patch: Maybe one in twenty attempts land. 
This is without any work on the resists - all gear is basic and does
not modify any resists.

I actually used this to my advantage.  I'd have the 34 druid pull
caster mobs.  I'd wait for the mobs to exhaust their mana supply on
the druid.  Then I'd bring back to the other char.

(2) Quadding spirocs in TD with my wiz used to yield nearly one snare
resist per quad roundup, and each subsequent AE nuke would be
partially or fully resisted by at least one bird in the bunch.

I have only quadded about 10 rounds since the patch was implemented,
but I don't recall ever seeing *any* resists - not even a partial on
the nuke.  That is very good news for quadding classes.



About that MR number, Martin - you've got some pretty incredible gear
there if you are keeping under your weight limit, getting the melee
stats up, AND have that kind of MR!  Grats
