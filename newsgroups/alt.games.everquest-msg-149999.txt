If he's not proud to be a Paladin, why the Hell's he playing the
class?  If another Paladin calls me a "pally", I simply inform him
that I hold no truck with people who are so ashamed of their own class
that they call it names.  Similarly, a Paladin who goes Anonymous is
another who's ashamed of his holy calling.

Before the quest came out to get the Ghoulbane, whenever I met a
Paladin carrying one, I'd inform him that he was, at best, a wanna-be
Paladin.  I made no bones about it to any such I met.  When the quest
came out, I had a Ghoulbane 2 days later.  About 2 weeks after that
another Paladin came up to me and showed me his Ghoulbane, informing
me that he'd done the quest to get it.  I congratulated him on getting
his Ghoulbane the honourable way.  Now, if it means nothing to get one
one way or the other, why do you think he went to all the trouble of
finding me specifically so he could show me that he'd done the
honourable thing?
