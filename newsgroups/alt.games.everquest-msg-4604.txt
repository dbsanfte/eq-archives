Learn to read.  In particular, look at his NNTP-Posting-Host header.
It's on the @home network.  @home uses dynamic IP addresses, but they
actually rarely change.  There's a very high chance the guy posted from
the same machine he plays on.  If Verant wanted, it would be an easy
matter to note all level 60 mages who play from that IP address, and ban
them if their billing information changes.
