Check out Gunthak (will be going light blue to you at the beach by now, 
further in will still be some dark blues) and Dulak (will be all dark blue 
with a few even and yellow cons on the ships).  Dulak has some nice drops 
off only semi-rare nameds (one of 'em toward the back of the docks pops 
about once per hour if you keep the placeholders down).  I got my druid 
twink a nice earring upgrade and some nice boots out of there.  You'll need 
some drops out of the warehouses to get your lvl 44 healing spell anyway 
(which is similar to chloroblast with laggier effects, and well worth the 
time involved).  Lots of gems (up to Blue Diamonds even) drop in there as 
well.

If you spend some time on the ships, you can get nameds there to pop as 
well.

You'll probably want a group in Dulak, or at least a duo.  I successfully 
two-box my enchanter and druid there for some nice XP; they're around level 
45-46.

Up into your 50s, you can start heading into Nadox, where you can get some 
pretty decent drops off some common nameds in there.
