I did not check very carefully, but Katta Castelum had a nice supply of
pottery, archery, and smithing supplies.  A wide variety of molds, ores, dye
making supplies, and sever forges nearby.  For pottery, similar setup.  I
did not check the archery supplies, but I assume a fairly full complement.
Also, I believe that both Shadowhaven, and The Bazaar have decent tradeskill
setups.
