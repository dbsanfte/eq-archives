I have never enjoyed PvP, but I'm of the mind that RvR is not the same
thing AFAIC.  The challenge of PvP has never unduly bothered me, but
rather the emotion of trying to beat up a real person. With RvR the
inability to speak with the enemy, let alone group, truly makes them into
an "enemy", and not simply someone you'll meet at the bank teller, and
thus I think I would be able to enjoy it for what it is...an opponent that
I cannot predict.  (This is why I feel that if a game is going try to have
lore where some races are enemies of others, they should impose
restrictions on interraction.  EQ2 does this a little.  And in Horizons
they had the good sense to have a reason for why all the races would work
together against a common enemy.)

But I do have another question about RvR.  How does it work?  Are there
special zones where these wars take place, and you just...show up and
"okie, find me a spot Jack!"?  does it rely heavily on players to make it
happen?

I've heard about these "buffbots"...or rather heard the name used in the
same sentence as hairpulling and gnashing of teeth.  If one were to be
part of a pair of characters, one of which HAD buffs, would they be a
match for an individual with a buffbot?  Or do buffbots hang around in
groups?

I'm currently VERY interested in the warden class.  A naturalistic healer
with a dose of fighting talents and a kick-arse self haste. Hmmm, sounds
like Foxeye to me...

...which is why I suspect that the Warden class is either hated or gimped.
Hybrid types usually are. :(

Y'know, I"mna get bumped from this NG soon...I keep talking about other
games. :/
