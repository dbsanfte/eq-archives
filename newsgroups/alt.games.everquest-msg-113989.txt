Although you -could- surmise this, the fact that they made the change
for the 1 to 10 end of the game makes your theory demonstrably
incorrect.

Before that change, if you'd told me it would be too difficult for some
arcane reason we have no access to to allow people to respawn
with thier loot intact, I'd have been puzzled (seems simple enough)
but unable to counterattack with any clear examples.

Now, though, you'd have to explain what is inherantly different for
programming purposes between that first ten levels and the remaining
50, and then how it can be that "first ten and not the rest" is actually
-easier- than "all sixty"

Note, this  is not a vote in favor of eliminating CR and Exp loss as
currently implemented, I think those factors make the game "hard"
and are part of what keeps us coming back; there's some "risk"
involved in doing things.

They've eliminated much of the risk for the lower levels not just by
killing that equation entirely for the first ten, but by adding much
lower Rez, Corpse Summons, and Succor spells.  Now if they could
work it somehow so that summoning a lower level corpse took a
cheaper coffin... currently those lower level spells are only usefull
for twinks IMO
