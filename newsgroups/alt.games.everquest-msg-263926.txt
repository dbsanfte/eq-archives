Which, of course, you were all along, since it has always required
DirectX 9.  I don't think DX9.0c is supported by any fewer graphics
cards than DX9.0, is it?

As for having graphics that current computers can't handle, that's
only if you turn on all the options, if you turn them down a little
it's eminently playable on current computers.  So if they add even
more graphics goodies than you can turn off in expansions, I see no
downside to this except that it costs money that could be spent on
other things.
