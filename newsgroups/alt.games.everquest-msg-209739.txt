Settings other than 0% AA or 100% AA don't make much sense.  Let's take your
proposed split, 80% AA/20% regular.  Suppose at that split, at your current
level, you'll get 2 AA points before your next level ding.

If you instead went 100% AA for those two AA points, then 100% regular until
you dinged, it would take the exact same total experience, and so, in the
worst case, takes exactly the same amount of time as 80/20, except that you
get the AA points earlier.  If you spend those AA points on things that make
you get XP faster, then 100% AA followed by 100% regular will get you to any
given point faster than a split.
