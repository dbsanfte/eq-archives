Warrior Room in Highkeep basement. You'll got to 30 in no time. Not to
mention seeing/causing/taking part in/and-or dying to some of the most
spectacular trains you'll see in low level dungeons. The pileups and
corpse stacks that can happen when a fatty get's stuck in the rafters at
the turn by the warrior room are simply......... breathtaking.
