AA abilities are abilities that you can earn at higher levels.  Once you
ding 51, you will have the option of having the experience you earn either
go towards leveling or earning AA points (or split it between the two).  You
can then spend the points you earn on the various AA abilities.  There are
AA abilities that allow you bind wounds better, run faster, increase your
hitpoints, increase your stats, use less mana with spells, avoid getting hit
in combat more often, and much more.

To see the AA's available for your class, press "V" to open the AA window.
You should see at least 3 tabs (more depending on whether you have PoP and
GoD expansions).  As you click on each item in the lists, you will see a
brief description of the ability.
