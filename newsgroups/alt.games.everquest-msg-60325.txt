if i may contradict you the second...
that damn user agreement pops up for you to log into you account you enter
into a contract with verant all over again, so if you log into the game
there is no way of bypassing the user agreement. therefor they can put in
there that you'll engage in oral sex with everyone in the united states and
since i'm sure you didn't read the whole thing you'll have to abide by it as
long as you keep clicking i agree to log into the game. so i wouldn't
attempt to challenge verant and sony interactive.
(i have no affiliations with verant, sony interactive, or any 1st or 3rd
party thereof)
