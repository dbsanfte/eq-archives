	Wherever he is now :-)


	Werewolves of LDON


I saw a werewolf a rusty dagger in his hand
walking through lesser faydark in the rain
He was looking for the mistmoore castle zone
goin to farm gargoyles again
Owwwooooo werewolves of LDON

If you see him howling down the hall
You better not pull him to your camp
Little dwarf cleric got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of LDON again
Owwwooooo werewolves of LDON

He's the hairy handed mob who ran amuck in pon
You know, the plane of nightmare
Better stay away from there
those werewolfs dont play fair
Just sit in pok and tailor

I saw a Chokdai Growler walking with the Queen
Doin the werewolves of LDON
I saw a werewolf buying Qeynos tea from trade Vik
and his hair was *perfect*
Owwwooo Werewolves of LDON again
Owwwoooo Werewolves of LDON
