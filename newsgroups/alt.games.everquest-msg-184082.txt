Ok when you ask a question dont argue with the answer. Ignore it or
take it dont matter but dont argue with it. After 2 rounds of "but why
doesnt it work this way" it gets old. Its a real button to have this
happen and it goes beyond rude. When 3 guys are telling ya exactly the
same thing maybe they know yet you argue with all 3.
