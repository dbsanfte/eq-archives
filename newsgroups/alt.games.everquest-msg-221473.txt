The problem is, if you go down that route then where does it stop?
Gonna pay the necros for their peridot(?) costs for harmshield? Gonna
cover mages and druid costs if they use decide to use banish summoned?
Gonna cover the cost for my shaman if I decide to start casting avatar
in a group? Clerics have a buff that people want, so if they cast it
their cost should be covered, all the rest are selfbuffs and (except
in very special circumstances) I consider it each group members
responsibility to decide whether they want to use a spell and eat the
cost.
