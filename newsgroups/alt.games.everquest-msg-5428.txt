YOU /assist the main tank first.

Then just do /pet attack.

Get ready to hit "/pet back off" just as soon as the critter is dead.  This
is especially important if you have an enchanter in your group.  If you do
not do this, the pet may start attacking the next critter and that will
really make the enchanter angry.

I have been in groups where we have had bad magicians...where we have had to
assist the pet because the magician was too stupid to control his pet
correctly.   At low levels this is normal, but at level 40 you should know
how to control your pet. :)
