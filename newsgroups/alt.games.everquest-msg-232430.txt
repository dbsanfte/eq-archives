Hamster:
I think so, I haven't actually "seen" where a nerfing has taken place, but I
have only seen 3 drop in my last 5-10 adventures. When LDoN dropped, I was
seeing multi drops per adventure.
Along the same lines: Bosses seem to be less in attendance now compared to
launch.
All good in my opinion. There needs to be a way to keep other zones
populated, if I were guaranteed a few chances at Augs/Boss loot per
adventure, I would never go anywhere else. I think they nerfed the Exp too,
but I don't see how if it is designed to be a certain level of mobs for your
group. It was almost like I seen a sudden drop in the amount of
exp/adventure.
