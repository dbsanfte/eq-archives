NOTHING beats a new high quality monitor. Especially for a rabid EQ
player that spends hours each day in front of one.

Many people complain about headaches after using 3D glasses. Most
units use a "shutter" effect that produces a flicker. Most people
cannot detect the flicker but will get a headache ocer time. That is
why they run at higher refresh rates to smooth out the flicker effect.
