Let me preface by saying that this comment was made while in a group
in the Lake of Ill Omen zone so I can expect old rumors, cliches and
the rest of the eq swill swirling around at the bottom of the
proverbial barrel to spew from someones mouth here at any given
moment.

Me: a 23rd cleric
The group i joined: 22nd rogue
		    22nd enchanter
		    21st shaman
they were saying    "LF tank at FD....pst"
then continuing	    "Hell...LF anyone"

Leader asked after we got a tank what other class should we get. Since
I had
seen a couple mages, wizards and necros LFG for a while I said we
could even use a caster type...like a wizard, mage or necro. Leader
promptly replies "Necros are not needed in a group". I damn near split
a tooth from ginding so hard. I asked "Why is that?" After a couple
pulls I asked if he had a necro. He said has a 12th level necro. Since
I have a 51 necro and have spent at least 30 of those levels in a
group setting I am still amazed as to why in normal xp, outdoor groups
are people so hung up on "Necros are solo class only. They dont belong
in a group." And to think that druids are whining about not getting
groups as they should....hell, up until the mid 30's people almost
want druids or shamans in a group more than they want clerics. (Yes
druids get gheal at 29 or so but they get superior heal at 51...na na
na na naaa!  :P ) And I dont see as many "Level so-and-so Necro LFG"
as I do see druid. Druids are as plentiful as kleenex. Pull one of out
the box and discard it and theres another one right in its place. (
btw...I have a 35 druid whom i love to play....albiet a half elf with
103 wisdom and bare assed nekked from giving all my gear to my alts)
SO how did this necro prejudice come about? Is it because pets can
break mezz when not controlled properly? When i was grouped I remember
clerics telling me to quit using CoB or Lich because they were sick of
healing me all the time (even after I explained the concept of
lifetap...."you know, takes life from mob and gives to me? you see my
health going up??) Which then leads them to believe they are NEVER
supposed to heal a necro in a group. Im not talking about situations
where everyone is sitting there waiting for puller to arrive with said
mob and necro stands up and lifetaps and gets his health back. Im
talking about add situations where, just like any other caster, a
necro gets aggroed and the cleric just looks on expecting the necro to
lifetap.....which is hard when your spell keeps getting interrupted.
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... ("why didnt you heal me?" ... "You arent
supposed to heal necros.....like you told me") DOH!...I surely can
attribute all this to the EC > NRO > OASIS > LOIO > OT > DL > KC
progression for new players who arent guilded and non-twinked. Thanks
to a.g.e for letting me bitch. :o)
