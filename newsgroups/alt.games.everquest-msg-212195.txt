Isn't the Singed Scroll turned in along with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer
for the second orb? So all the MQer has to do is turn in the scroll first, 
then the cleric turn in the sceptre, and the cleric gets the orb?

IIRC the Gimblox ring is the pain in the ass piece to MQ, as that is
turned in for the Ornate Sea Shell which is turned in to Naxot for
the Message to Natasha which is turned in for the shimmering pearl.
Whomever hands the pearl to Zordak has to do the fragment farming.
