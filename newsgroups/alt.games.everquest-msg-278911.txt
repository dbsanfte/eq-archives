Because SOE says if you can attack a mob, which can't harm you, it
would encourage powerleving. Mind you hitting from distance is the
sensible tactic for a mage, ie fire of loads of spells at range, once
the mob closes the distance root it, back of and start hitting it
again.

The thing about fighting in water that gets me is how it works. I mean
how does my mage ignite and fire a fire bolt while under water? How
come my electric bolt doesn't kill me and everything else near it?
The whole thing is ludicrous if you think about it.
