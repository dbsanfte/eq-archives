Have you tried Anarchy Online?  The software download is free (retail price
is paid if you decide to stay after the trial), and the first seven days are
free.  I tried it about three weeks ago, and it's a ton of fun.

I know they had the roughest launch known to MMORPGs.  I'd pretty much
written the game off completely after that, to be honest.  But the review of
the Sahdowlands expansion in CGW tickled my curiousity, so I figured, "What
the hell?  The whole trial is free."  They've definitely made up for the
lousy launch ... in spades.  Their CS is first rate as well.

I didn't quit EQ either.  I did drop down to one account, though.  Didn't
seem to make much sense to keep two accounts once I decided to keep AO.

Just a suggestion if you're looking for something new to try.
