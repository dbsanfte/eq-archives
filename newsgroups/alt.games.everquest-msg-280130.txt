I raid 3 to 4 times a week, and play in groups/solo at other times.  
Buying all the damage avoidance AAs has made a significant difference in 
group/solo play, and a noticable difference on raids.

Yes, that was the choice he mentioned, but, there are other options which 
are likely to have a more pronounced effect on his play than those two.

With 45 AAs I'd bet he is missing a lot of healing AAs yet, and also nuke 
and DoT improvement spells.  All of those would be far more useful as 
well.
