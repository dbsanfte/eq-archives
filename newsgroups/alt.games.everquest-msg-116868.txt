I play in a little good(ish) aligned group in the Qeynos / Odus area.
We consist of (Currently)

2 * Druid, Monk, Enchanter, Shamman, Warrior, Rogue, Cleric
1 * Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Wizard

Our top level at the moment is 19, but then we only play one w/e per
month <G>
(Great for raids on the warrens)
I see a lot of necros and SKs about (but since we are good-ish we ignore
them)
I have not seen any beastlords.

In fact checking my log files (since annon was able to come off)
I see no BL and shamen and only one rogue (Obviously some of my group
are sill annon)
I see lots of druids rangers and enchanters (But that may be because I
am one and have done other searches)
There don't seem to be many bards either.

HTH,

Jim (Treelore on FV Jeweling 94 ! and only level 16)
