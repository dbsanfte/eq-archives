Laptop video card drivers generally aren't the same as the ones which
are recommended for use by the game companys (SOE in this case) so
often they don't work well with them at all.  I found the following
website a long time ago:

http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/

which has a bunch of modified drivers for use with laptops.  I take no
responsibility for any problems you may encounter from using drivers on
that website, I'm just passing along the information.  Personally, I
was able to get EQ to kind of run with them...but not nearly well
enough for my tastes.  But since I couldn't get it to run at *all* with
the default drivers, and you can get it to sort of run, it might just
be that extra oomph you need to have it be playable.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
