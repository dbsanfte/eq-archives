I think this is a false dichotomy.  I don't think many, if any games reduced 
the effort spent in producing the game simply to sunstantiate the manual. 
It's a separate issue.

I think the argument can be made that the inverse is as true, in fact, that 
if a game maker doesn't invest the time and effort necessary into its manual 
production, you'll see similar lack of effort put into other areas.  If they 
don't have the passion for what they're doing such that they'd try to get 
everything done well and with enthusiasm, chances are it's not going to 
manifest itself in just one area.  But again, it's not like the team writing 
the manual would otherwise be coding or bug testing the game if they weren't 
too busy writing up their more-involved-than-it-needed-to-be manual.

As for me, one of my rituals in game purchasing that has gone back two 
decades was getting the game out to the car, cracking the thing open and 
pulling out the manual to get myself really pumped up to play the thing once 
I got it home.  I'd do that even when I was the guy driving, pulling out the 
manual at the stoplights and such to look at it when I didn't have to be 
paying attention to driving.

And that did get rather disappointing when I'd purchase games with a manual 
that had nothing more than installation instructions, how to start the game, 
configurations, and key controls.
