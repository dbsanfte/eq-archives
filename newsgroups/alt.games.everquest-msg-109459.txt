I was in N.ro the other day and went to the barbarian village to get some
fishing supplies (I may as well be doing something whilst i med) and noticed
3 different hook types. I logged off and went to www.eqtraders.com and tried
to find what they were for, the web site said that if you find various
animal fur and combine one of the hooks with silk thread and a hook, you get
a lure that adds +2/3/4% to your fishing skill.

Not really any ground breaking news but it was a nice suprise to find a
little hidden feature like that.
