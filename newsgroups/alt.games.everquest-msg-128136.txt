    And note that GFay has ground spawns located in it of use in smithing.
Ground spawns that aren't placed by landmarks, but rather are all over the
place. The first people to find the spawn points and report where they were
used ShowEQ, and it's not hard to figure out why - nobody that would get XP
in the woods goes in the woods because it's too easy to get lost, and people
that wouldn't get XP in the woods don't go there because there's no point.
