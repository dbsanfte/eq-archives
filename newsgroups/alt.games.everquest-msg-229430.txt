I don't have anything other than to say that they nerfed it good and proper.
LDON rooms and passages are almost impossible now as I aggro up to 3 mobs
distant when trying to pacify. The drop rate on collects has also gone
pear-shaped.

I hope they fix it in the patch tomorrow or I am going to give up LDON.
