I am a Dark Elf Necromancer, and I'm having problems all over only being
able to get up to Dubious.  Am I forever doomed to stay this way?  I've
killed nearly 200 Kobolds (log file counts 190+) in the Warrens, and went
from threateningly to dubious with the guards almost immediately (maybe
10-20 kills?).  I've had the same problem with Freeport.  I've killed 400
orcs now, at least 250 of them having been at orc 1 & 2 (mainly 1, maybe
10-20 at most being orc 2), and still am only dubious to the merchants &
Freeport guards (and having turned in about 6 belts as well).
    The ONLY non Dark Elf faction I've raised was the one in Shadow Haven on
Luclin, and doing that quest, I went from dubious to apprehensive in only
about 2-3 runs (each run gives 2 faction hits).  Then within another 5-10
was at indifferent, and then within another 10 was amiable, but after
another 20-25 (2 faction hits each, so 40-50 faction hits) I'm still at the
same I was before, amiable to them, indifferent & apprehensive & dubious to
the other 3 faction hits you take.  It's as if I've hit a max there too.
    Are Dark Elves or also being a Necromancer, stuck at a certain faction
level, never to be increased, or made much harder to increase?  Like someone
else being able to do a quest, and once hitting dubious (from threatening),
do the quest 10 times more to get to apprehensive, yet a Dark Elf, or a
Necromancer (or both, DE Necro) may have to do the quest to get to dubious,
then do the same one 50 times rather than 10 to get to apprehensive?  Does
faction work like this, where the hit takes race & class into account for
how strong of hit it is?
    Am I able to go above a certain faction, or is it worthless trying?  I'm
currently in the Warrens.  Some say to group, but due to my playing hours
that are available, this isn't possible (if so it will be RARE).  Yesterday
I was the only one in the zone, the day before I was 1 of 2 people, and the
other was first someone 6+ LVs below me, then later it was someone 8 levels
above me.
    I need to either VERY soon be able to get to bank in Paineel, or move to
another hunting ground, as I have 2,400 coins on me at the moment (that's 60
of my 65, or 73 with siphon strength, weight limit).
