Personally I have no problem with twinking. Even when i couldn't do it for
my own alts. Most of the time I would rather grooup with a twink than a non
twink. The reason being is most twinks are alts, so they already now how to
play.

I have twinked one character, my rogue. She recieved all the gear I had
sitting in the bank and I hunted for a few items that she could use. All the
twinking did was allow me to be more of a tank at low levels and to not die
as easily. It made my low levels go a bit faster although I did not push it
because I wanted skills to max. I am currently level 41 and melee skills are
all maxed and I need a couple more points to max swim, hide and ID, while
other non cambat skills are maxed. I get guild offers frequently (guessing
because I play my rogue well), so twinking didn't hurt me at all, just let
me accomplish my goals faster. I would guess that I am almost caught up to
my gear so its time to camp the boring stuff to get better stuff.
BTW, was in a group in HK a while back with my twink rogue when she was
level 24 and the entire group consisted of alt twinks, we took LR, GR and
occasionally pulled the WR and I was the highest one there, it was a blast.
Thats the main point of playing a game is to have fun right?
