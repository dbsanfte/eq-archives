That's the whole point. If the box says "works on amiga" then it bloody well
should work on an amiga. If you can download patches or buy expensions which
have specifically stated that it has higher requirements, people can still
opt for not downloading it and play the "old" game.

IF I have win95, I go to a store and buy games that say "works on win95" and
expect them to WORK on win95. EQ's box says "works on win95", but it
doesn't.

That's sueable for providing false information.


Well, sueable in the US. Europeans usually laugh things like this off.
