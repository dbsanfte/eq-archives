This should be a wake up call - don't play these types of games ever again.

It seems to me that you were both as bad as each other, she for messing
around with random guys online while being married and lying to you about
many details (perhaps leading you on somewhat), and you for going along with
it despite knowing she is married and then chasing her around for however
long you did after the relationship was over. Her husband might have had the
right to know, but the way you went about it was all wrong. It seems to me
you tried to hurt him to get at her, but your conversation lacked
credibility because you used LOL and =). Who knows what he ended up
thinking?


I stand by my suggestion of seeking some advice with a trained councillor or
whatever is available to you. Usenet is not a good place to vent this type
of stuff because you will mostly get negative responses which won't help you
right now.

Good luck.
