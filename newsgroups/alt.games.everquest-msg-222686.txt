I think they gunna change this again... at some point I think they
will make LDoN duo able, or even Solo able.....

Interesting... I haven't read any of these in quite some time...
curious what they may say..

Um, what?...  number of items found at the END?.... not really sure
what they are saying... when you are successfully.. stuff falls from
the sky?

This is nice... ill add it to my training macro.... but hell why not
just go ahead and make the skill 200... its gunna be there some day
anyways...  just like sense heading

This is good... allows people to have the buff they want / need
without having to run a mile away because someone is MGB'ing something
or another...
>

Little disappointed that nothing was mentioned about the Unshrinkable
beastlords warders...   well unshrinkable is a little wrong... they
are only shrinkable one time....

Curious to see how this looks

Yep, curious on this one too... I'm assuming its going to look similar
to the find trader... well the indicator that forms around the trader
when you draw near to them..

Hmmm.. wonder if Ill really use this feature...

This gunna be turned off immediately

Had thought it was odd acting.. glad they fixed it.... no show stopper
by far, but an esthetics thing....
>

Thank you... dint happen to often, but on occasion clicked find trader
on wrong trader.. and that sucker wouldn't go away until I found em..

>** For the New Player **

Are there really that many new players in games to be a cause for the
need of this?
