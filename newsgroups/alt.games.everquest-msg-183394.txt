If you get it again and it doesn't work, another fast fix to try is to
Alt Enter  as if you were going into window mode, then back again. I had
the same thing and that fixed it.

On our server boards, another person had the same problem and couldn't
clear it with any of these tricks. They, however, quit out and ran a
throrough file check and it started working ok. Could be coincidence
with this bug, but worth a shot.
