Depends on the level.  Necs get Screaming Terror at level 24, which can mez
anything up to level 55.  With ST a necromancer should be able to keep 2
mobs mezed as long as there aren't any resists.  At 63 there is an undead
mez that works on mobs up to level 65.  The undead mez lasts 30 seconds, so
a nec could keep 5 mobs mezed.  I have held down 6 for a while on one
occation, but I have an extended duration focus.
