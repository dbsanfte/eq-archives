No it means not giving student visas to students from countries that harbor
or do not cooperate in freezing terrorist funds, nabbing terrorists, etc...

Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the list goes on.

The president announced yesterday that this is now starting to occur.

Why should we educate anyone from any other country at all? It is because we
are good people, and want to help other countries as well as be open. But
that grace should not be extended to any country that is not convincing us
that it's trying to fight terrorism.
