Quite true. As you get to higher levels tho, monsters start hitting too
hard, and also your roots seem to work more reliably on whatever you hunt.
Not sure if this is because of the better root spell, or the inreasing
difference in level (you tend to hunt lower con blues as you advance).

At level 29 you get immolate, but I fould that not to be worth the resists.
However, at 52 you get breath of ro, which is a nice stackable dot. 53 you
get winged death, which stacks with both breath of ro, and drifting
death/drones (es vambraces).

With 3 stackable dots, and a reliable root, and *en*snare which lasts about
5 mins or something, it makes for a very easy and efficient way to kill
single mobs.
