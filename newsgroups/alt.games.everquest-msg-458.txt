I'm a 34 Druid who often solos.  I've been fighting in Frontier Mtns and
Overthere a lot lately.

I've ported over to Velious four times:

1st time - #3) Got attacked by snow dervishes right away.  Wimped out and
gated.

#4)  Made it to the dragon bridge.  Kited a mammoth in Eastern Wastes.  TONS
of HP.  After unloading, it still had 1/3 HP... gave up.  Kited an elite
giant in Iceclad.  Same thing... TONS of hp.. couldn't bring it down.
Camped and thought about never playing eq again =).

Any tips on what I should be doing over there in Velious?  I'd really
appreciate the help.

Jim
