Strangely, ec tunnel is exactly where I have the biggest problem with it.  
There are, on a good day, probably 60-70 people there in the tunnel.  
Probably 3-5 of them are actually there to sell stuff they are wearing.  
They're usually easily identifiable, since they're (a) wearing total crap 
except in 2 slots, and more importantly, (b) /shouting Selling all on me 
at Shady!! every 30 seconds or so.  (dammit, why won't they use /auc...)  
They've given the entire zone blanket permission to inspect -them-.  No, I 
won't sell you my Insidious Robe no matter how badly you want it.

I have, -once-, sold something to someone who came up and randomly 
inspected me.  I had a Student's Homework that I'd -just- gotten not an 
hour before... But he offered 1700pp, a Sarnak Dagger, and a Molten Cloak.  
Dang... I'm up 4 int -and- 1700pp?  Ok, I can't turn that down. :)  And it 
still wouldn't have killed him to have asked before inspecting me, now, 
would it?  I might even have let it go at a lower price.

But once out of 20-odd times doesn't make it worthwhile, especially since 
it's usually "Will you please take these 20 things you'll never ever be 
able to use and spend 20 hours trying to sell for that equipment that you 
actually need?  Eqprices says the combined total of my crap is worth 
almost 12pp more than it is..."

Hell no.  You go sell your crap.  Bring me plat or stuff I can actually 
use.  And better, buy the velium jewelry and Wu's I'm actually here to 
hawk instead of trying to make off with my wardrobe.
