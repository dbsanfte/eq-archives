That's an excellent idea.  Most people would think that the thing to do to
keep someone alive while the big but slow Cleric heal is coming in is to
cast a small but fast heal.  However, if the Cleric is casting Complete
Heal, or another heal that will bring the person up to full or close, then
this wastes some mana.

With the damage absorber instead, the person gets the full benefit of your
spell *and* the full benefit of the Cleric's heal.

Damage absorbers are good to use on casters, because it seems that when an
attack is completely absorbed by the shield, it has little or no chance of
interrupting the caster, which is great if they are trying to get a gate or
an evac off.
