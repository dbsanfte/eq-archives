  It happened in Halls of Honor, graveyard kite group.

  (DING)
  You gain party experience!
  You have gained a level! Welcome to level 65!!
  You no longer suck.

  Okay, maybe not that last line. But still, a great achievement. Top of the
hill.
Maybe it would feel better if they weren't raising the cap again in a few
months.
And likely you won't be able to get to 70 at a bearable pace unless you XP
in
the OOW zones. Or maybe Kod'Taz...which requires more flagging.

  For now, the place to be for a wizard seems to be level 62. I don't want
to sac
down and waste all the hard work of getting to 65, but Nadox quadding just
won't
give me the AAXP at 65 that it did at 62...all the mobs I'd quad are now
light blue,
and worth less than before. I have yet to find a place to quad where the
mobs are
 still dark blue. I have to search around. Does anyone know where to go
where:
  1. There is lots of open space to quad;
  2. The mobs are barely dark blue to a 65;
  3. The mobs have less than 12,000 hit points? This is as much as I can
dish out with
a full mana bar using targeted AE's.

  For now, I can still get AA's in Plane of Valor, Halls of Honor, and
Bastion of Thunder.
And Crypt of Decay; I'm on the lookout for a CoD raid for Bert access. The
raid last
weekend was hijacked by a guild wanting to do practice; they didn't need the
flags.

  Also, I'm looking for an Agnarr raid. And AD and RD; tried RD last weekend
as well,
and was caught sitting down when he popped. I was the first to die, and the
raid wiped
at 1%. That hurts; I've had dreams of making the difference against him, and
here I had
the chance to do it - and blew it. Next time...
  Getting an AD raid seems harder. Meybe he's done in the middle of the week
during
prime time, when I'm at work. Have to hope someday he's being done on a
weekend.

  Other news:
  I have filled out the last spot in my stable of TP characters: a classic
kitty beastlord by
the randomly generated name of Grukyn. This was my first encounter with the
new
tutorial; I think it takes something away from the classic EQ experience -
the experience
of seeing a whole level go by in five kills. Grukyn was level 2 already when
going to
play cat-and-mouse in the streets of Qeynos. Still, he weathered the usual
sequence
well, playing cat-and-dog in Blackburrow up to level 9, and is now poised to
tear open
the throne room in Crushbone...when the new patch stablizes.
  Concerning which...there may be a new demand for Rabotev and his services:
buffing
pets as well as PC's. I would certainly want to get Grukyn's warder buffed
with Storm
Strength, Chloro, Temp, and a good DS, or perhaps shaman Focus for dex. That
should
get Grukyn through Estate of Unrest to level 16 and ready for Paludal
Caverns.

  Neuvenieu, the Shadow Knight, is now 39 and rising fast. I want to take
her to Dulak,
now that the entrance is permacamped, and join that camp; stay there a few
levels and
she can do lots of fun stuff. Then switch her out with Grugg, and later
Tosev. The way
to the higher levels is now open.
  But these higher levels are costly. Spells are now beginning to run in the
higher
thousands of plat. Adas has been quadding mobs in Dulak again herself,
taking the
weaker stuff that falls in two or three AE's and often drop opal bracers
worth 80pp and
mithril amulets worth 95pp. Sometimes she can catch the Ice Giants in
Permafrost
uncamped. And she's going to be run all over Norrath trying to quad
placeholders for
druid epic mobs - barracudas in LOIO, seafuries in OOT. Kedge is going to be
tricky; she
may have to see what mobs she can take down entirely with stuns.
