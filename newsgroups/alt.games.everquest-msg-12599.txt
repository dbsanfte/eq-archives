I asked because I just got killed twice trying to use the South Ro
turn-in point. My enchanter is only 14th.  Her and her pet are not much
of a match for a crypt mummy, some kind of zombie, and a desert madman. 
I had just turned in 8 DF belts and was happy with the exp. gain.  The 2
deaths put me right back where I started.  I'm wondering if trying to
turn in 5 LSs and 3GLSs may cost me more than it gains me.

I was also thinking of waiting till I reach 16 and get the invisibility
to undead.  Then I would only have to avoid the living things, for the
most part.  Problem there is that while I would be better equipped to
handle the area at 16th level, the LSs and GLSs wouldn't be as valuable
to me then.  I'd have to turn in lots more for the same exp. rush.  That
means more time in the danger area to get jumped.  IMHO, it's kind of a
lose-lose situation for casual players.  At low levels you either have
to have a group to escort you to S.Ro, hire some one to protect
you(there goes the profits), or wait till you're a little higher
level(20+??) and the turn-ins aren't worth as much.

On the second part of your response, I completely forgot about the oasis
turn-in point.  I haven't taken any characters there yet.  How safe is
it?  If it's much safer, then my previous ranting will make me look the
fool.  I could live with that though, if it makes it worth the trouble.

Thanks.
