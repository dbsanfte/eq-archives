On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the old "Vision" and 10 being the current
game. I would rather play something that is a 2 or 3. 

When EQ launched it was hard. The difficulty made it a challenge, and
the "carrot" dangled in front of players was incredibly addicting.
Just hitting level 20 and getting a surname was a milestone. It wasn't
all wine and roses, but it was a lot more satisfying in a lot of ways
than the game we have today.
