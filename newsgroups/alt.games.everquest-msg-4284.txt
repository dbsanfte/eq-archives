LOL
Yeah... roger on the "booooring"... I never liked D&D either.

I am a rank amateur geek, dwelling mostly in the Fighter Ace NG, lurking in
a few others. Fighter Ace has been the only game I have played on the
computer (using the computer mostly for other things-writing and graphics
apps).

All things considered, I am shopping for the CD's now.. as RPG factor or no,
I think she will love EQ.

Time will tell.
