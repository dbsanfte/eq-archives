Hrmm.  I find what I think of as "l33t sp34k" (?sp?) annoying, as it
fits your "deliberately obfuscates" description, and I rarely make any
effort to decode it.  But there's a lot of shorthand in use that is
not obfuscutory, and while I don't use it I've learned to read it and
don't object to it (anymore), even tho it sets my teeth on edge from
time to time.  If you're gonna lump it all together as "Dood speak",
then you're both right and wrong, or so it seems to me.

Another thing I wonder, is whether there is any meaningful difference
between "l33t spe4k" and, let's say, the jargon that fans of american
football use when discussing their favorite pasttime (other than the
apparently deliberate attempt to be non-understandable to outsiders by
the l33tsp34krs).  In both cases you have "initiates" using a "code"
to make much ado about not much of anything.
