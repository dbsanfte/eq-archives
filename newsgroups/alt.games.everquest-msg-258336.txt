I think at very low levels and amounts of xp earned per quest/kill the 
mathmatical voodoo they did to eliminate class penalties doesn't work 
very well.


A very brief explanation for the OP:
When they created the game they built a table (using a formula, but 
still a table) of how much xp was needed to level a 'basic' character.

For, say, paladins they wrote a new table, with all the amounts required 
upped by something like 25% iirc.

When they took the penalties out, due to the way things were tracked 
they couldn't simply change out the tables. Instead they gave paladins a 
25% bonus to the xp they got.
(imaginary number follow)
So instead of 500 xp to level to 2, the paladin needs 625.
Cleric however needs 500
If you get xp in small increments, part of the +25% may very well vanish 
as rounding errors.
cleric gets 10, pal gets 12, cleric gets 5, pal gets 6, cleric gets 15, 
pal gets 18, etc..
Also I've read somewhere that there is compelling evidence that the 'fix 
it' bonus doesn't work right on quest xp, but even those who complain 
about that don't make too much noise about it because, really, you 
maybe get 1% of your xp throughout your life on quests, unless you are 
like my friend who leveled to 40 on shark meat way back in the day (that 
was a hella lotta shark meat too. And he did this before you could walk 
by there and see 40 people standing around turning in meat... at least 
he was an early adopter, eh?)
