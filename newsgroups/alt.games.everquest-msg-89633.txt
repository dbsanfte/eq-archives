Yeah, this is pretty much why I said the original petition was
invalid. It did not say what they want except for the people who can't
play to be able to play and for there to be no more problems. Verant
wants this same thing to happen and is of course working towards that
goal, hence the constant patching and fixing of problems. So its
ridiculous to get a petition about something a company is already
doing.

If I was verant/sony I'd also say "uhh so what do you want us to do?"

<petition people> we want you to fix your game so we can play!

<verant sony> uhhh.. that is what we have been trying to do all this
time..

<petition people> ....
