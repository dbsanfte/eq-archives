And there's no slightest possibility that the intent of these things
was to provide a limited means of mitigating the presumably inferior
damage taking abilities of a leather class?

That's a legitimate beef.  While I think it's simply stupid that Monks
are often better tanks than Warriors and Knights (and I do mean often,
I've seen a 25 Monk, who was jealous of my 25 Warrior's FBSS, solo
tank mobs taking almost no damage that would do the Warrior for over a
third of his HP), I also think it's stupid of VI to go forward with this
change without doing something to maintain the Monk's role as premier
puller at minimum.  As it is the change is akin to removing the
Enchanter's Mez spells:  they could still give haste and mana regen
buffs, Tash would still be there along with all their stuns and etc.,
but it would be a huge nerf and probably impossible to swallow without
substituting some alternate way for the Enchanter to remain the crowd
controller of choice in most environments.
