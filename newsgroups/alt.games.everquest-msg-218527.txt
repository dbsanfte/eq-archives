Let me clarify something: I'm not saying Clinton was great. I'm just
pissed off at the double-standard.

The Republicans bash Clinton for experimenting with Pot once upon a
time. Bush experimented with harder drugs once, and the Republicans
say "Oh, he was just a kid!".

The Republicans bash Clinton for avoiding the draft for the sake of
his family. Bush dodged the draft for the sake of his schooling, and
they say "Oh, no problem!".

The Republicans bash Clinton for lying about having an affair with a
secretary (What married man wouldn't if they had an affair?!). Bush
knowingly passes on false intelligence and uses it to spark off a war,
they say "Oh, that's okay. Sadaam needed to be taken care of anyway!".

For everything Clinton did wrong, Dubya has done just as bad or WORSE.
While the Republicans railed Clinton constantly for his mistakes, they
forgive Dubya his without a second thought, then call the Democrats
hypocrites for criticizing him!

And, yes, I also hold a grudge against Dubya for things like trying to
weasel government support for Christian projects around that little
"separation of church and state" thing and trying to dismiss Wiccan
rights by classifying Wicca as "not a real religion".
