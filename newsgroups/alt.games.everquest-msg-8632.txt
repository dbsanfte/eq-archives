After rethinking the situation, I've gone ahead and reported you to
mindspring, bizbee.

Anyone who would keep an "enemies list" complete with names, addresses, and
phone numbers at his desk ( obviously an insane act in and of it's self )
and then to threaten to post said information to Usenet ( another unstable
reaction ) is clearly unbalanced and a threat to his community.

It's only a matter of time before bizbee does real physical harm to someone.

Anyone who supports this type of  terrorizing behavior needs to rethink
their ethical standards for a few minutes or seconds, depending on your
level of common sense, of course.

Bizbee has crossed the line of ethical behavior.  It's probably not his
first offense, either.
