The two styles can connect however, if you find the right guild.  Our 
guild has one optional raid per week, with a few ally guilds.  Other 
than that, we have no other scheduled events, no recruitment 
restrictions (other than level 20+) and nothing else you would associate 
with raiding guilds.

We're currently EP flagged and killing DoN dragons, which isn't bad for 
a once-a-week-casual raid force.

EQ supports loads of styles of play, and has lots of choice, that's its 
great strength.

If you don't have a good social network and don't want to solo, it'll 
suck like an open chest wound, that's its great weakness.
