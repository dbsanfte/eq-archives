Heh. I sort of agree about the boots... I've been tempted to get ES boots 
and gaunts, but losing 15 WIS for two crappy effects is something than 
even the most fashion-conscious druid would wince at. And I live in hope 
of getting those GEGs some day. :)

I've tried the latest Detonator drivers (date, two days ago) from the 
Nvidia site, and /dopropertinting works now, my neck is no longer green. 
Unfortunately, they seem to have introduced some kind of memory leak 
too... I find myself having to quit to desktop every now and then to 
restore framerates to something acceptable.
