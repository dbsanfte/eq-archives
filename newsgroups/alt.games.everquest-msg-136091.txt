...Of course, you'll probably need a bit of luck getting a replacement -
I've been waiting for an delivery of EQGold (from Tesco online, of all
places!) for weeks now, and I'm beginning to suspect UbiSoft might have not
produced any copies for a while, since nowhere I've seen online or on the
high street seems to have any in stock at the moment.  How much does that
suck?  It was only released about three months ago.  Anyone know anything
about this?

sell him EQ!)
