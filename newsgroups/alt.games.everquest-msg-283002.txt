Hi all,

I am just wondering if there is a legal way to sell accounts with toons on  
them?

I decided to no longer play EverQuest but paid on a yearly basis. So there  
are some month left on each of my 3 accounts. And all Accounts have all  
expansions except the latest one (PoR).

So even if SOE is saying, that the toons and all stuff belongs to them and  
it is fobidden to sell them, it should be possible to at least sell the  
paid time on the accounts and the expansions that are on them.


Maybe someone has experience with this issue? As far as I know, SOE don't  
like the selling of accounts and they do stuff to prohibit it.

But is it possible to sell just the said stuff above without mentioning  
the toons on the account on eBay? Or is that illegal, too?

With kind regards,

Konrad
