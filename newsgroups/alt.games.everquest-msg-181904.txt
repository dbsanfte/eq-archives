You forget, we're talking about druids here.  You know, playing EQ in
"easy mode".  In fact, having played almost exclusively melees, I can
tell you that it's fun to take a druid out and kill some red cons,
especially mobs that my Paladin would've had a tough time killing when
they were 4 levels blue to him.  I have no difficulty believing the
guy who claimed to have solo'd HGs at 29, tho that's just asking for
it since about one HG in 20 will be L37 and impossible for a L29 to
stick a spell on.  But doing something like that, while good for a few
laughs, isn't very effective, in the time you kill one HG as a L29 you
could kill four to six other mobs for nearly as much loot and way more
xp.
