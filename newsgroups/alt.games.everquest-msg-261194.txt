I headed to Best Buy today and picked up OoW. Then I figured that since I'm 
now into my 50's on my main, what the heck, and grabbed GoD as well. Yeah, 
I know, I thought about just buying the platinum version to get GoD and 
then OoW, giving myself another account if I wanted, but a) I don't want 
another account, b) it would have cost me $10US more, and c) I guessed that 
using the platinum key to register GoD on an existing account would prevent 
me from getting an additional account out of it, anyway, at least under the 
conditions I would prefer.

My question is, since I did all the OoW downloading and I'm pretty sure GoD 
as well, do I need to actually install from the CD's? I'd hate to run the 
retail installs only to see everything I've already downloaded over-written 
with older versions, causing me to have to patch it all back up again.

Can I just register the keys and be done with it?
