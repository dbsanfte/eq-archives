Aye

However, if you think the other person is in trouble then by all means help
if you're so inclined. There is no real crime in helping someone who doesn't
ask for it. I do it in EQ and RL all the time. I'm a Druid so I can snare
the Mob and give the player a chance to get away. Who knows - maybe their
alt is a 56 Cleric who will remember your name : )

Of course I often get tells: 'y didnt u kil it man - i had to zone' usually
followed by 'can u buff me' as opposed to 'Thank you!'

Ah well, remember what the wise man once said... 'No good deed goes
unpunished'
