When this change was first announced, and was subsequently discussed
here, that was one of the biggest flaws that I noted.  VI's intention in
this was good. The implementation wasn't terribly bad. But the one big
open wound in the plan, just waiting to become infected, was that fact
that any guild who, either by intent or by luck, could be FIF in an
open, easily accessible zone like Skyfire, could nail that dragon
instantly. This leads to two results. First, the dragon drops other
stuff off Naggy's loot table, so there is incentive to highjack the
dragon just for the loot, if nothing else. Second, the Cleric drop from
there *can* (as you point out) be gotten at any time. So, "Oh, all the
55+ clerics have epics? Fuck it. Kill it anyway. Anybody have a cleric
alt? Yeah? Ok. Give it to bob's level 3 cleric alt. He might start
leveling it someday."

The solution was (and remains to this day) CLEARLY obvious. First:
Remove all the loot from this beast's loot table except the heart.
Second: Make the heart *NO FUCKING RENT* until it's got the last piece
put in it and combined. Then it becomes nodrop, but not no-rent, so even
if the Cleric LD's right then, the epic can still be finished.

Problem solved.

As to the "waiting list" problem. No clue. Our server certainly has
never seemed to come up with many such lists. Not that last, anyway.
Depends who you talk to and which mobs/zones you are going after, of
course.
