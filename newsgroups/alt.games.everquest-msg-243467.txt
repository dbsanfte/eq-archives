And you'll find.. when all is said and done, that people can and
should be allowed to do so without intervention. One of the first
things they should do is stop calling them games. Its a world modeled
after our own with as much validity as the world you live in, the
world in the house you live in, or the world at the job that you work
at. Why is it so shocking that items gravitate in and out of the
Everquest world and are bought and sold using real life money? Is it
that your brain has been conditioned to reject any world that has been
defined as a 'game'? How real does it have to be before you begin to
accept it as truth? Does it have to be as real as say the one depicted
in The Matrix? One where all your senses have been stripped and
replicated so that you no longer have an excuse with which to reject
it? At the moment, Sony is in the process of trying to protect their
world from the normal human instincts towards greed, and in that, they
and those who agree will surely lose. You can't fight human instincts.
If people want to do something, they will. Either accept it and adapt
or they'll do it anyways. Its that simple.
