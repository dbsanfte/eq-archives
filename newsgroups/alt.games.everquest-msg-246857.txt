I never once had a chanter for mountain trials. No mez or charm for a single
vxed and tipt that i did. We didnt even have voq/vq for either!

I passed trials second in my guild (same night as the first) using monk,
monk, cleric, shaman, warrior, ranger. (first time win on both trials, on
first attempt of all named mobs)

Is that group really very specialised? I think not.

2 healers.. sure, cleric+shaman. That gives you the best slower, and second
best buffer too.
Oh n0z! No charmed pooka then.. however could we win?!

Last time I did Tipt, group was as follows btw:
SK, Shaman, Rogue, Cleric, Magician, Warrior

Again, not a specialised group in the slightest.
