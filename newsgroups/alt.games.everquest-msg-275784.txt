Well, as a Sage, I can tell you I have found crafting to be very 
unprofitable.  Adept 1s seem to be too easy to come by, and they sell at 
low enough prices that I cannot manage to eek more than a small profit 
for an app IV spell, if I can sell it at all.  Added to that difficulty 
in selling was the extreme difficulty in actually making the spells being 
that at tier 3, I need paper, quills, and ink.  The people who make the 
paper and quills needed alchemist made components.  The ammount of 
interaction between the various skills there is just ludicrous, to the 
point that prices for components tended to be high, such that I could not 
make a profit by making spells.  Patterns for armor were almost equally 
as bad, requiring the same paper, and thread to make.

Basically, my sage ended up doing nothing more than making patterns and 
spells for guildies, when 3 other guildies could get around to making him 
the subcomponents he required.  So, I made an alt provisioner, who 
requires noone else in order to make his products, and thus is not 
severely hampered in both advancement, and the ability to sell product.  
Not to mention that actually creating items cost next to nothing, so I 
was happy to make them for myself, even if I was not bothering to sell.

As to whether the solution they came up with was the right one, that is a 
different question, but something had to change, the system was horribly 
broken as it stood, with the alchemists laughing all the way to the bank.
