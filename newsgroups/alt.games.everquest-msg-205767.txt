My 54 druid has been soloing in skyfire for quite a while.  I started
hunting chromos actively after accidently fighting one, and I found
them pretty easy.  Then, a few months ago after a patch, I engaged a
chromo and was shocked when it immediately started dispelling me.  I
assumed I had made some mistake, but it seems that Verant seriously
increased the range at which chromos dispelled, so it was the same or
exceeded my snare range.

I gave up on them for a while, then tried them again recently.  Either
Verant slightly decreased the dispell range, or else my technique is
better.  I find that if I'm extremely careful to back up immediately
after snaring, I may get dispelled once, but after that I can root and
dot fairly safely.
