Easiest way?  Give a tell to them that twinked you...  I'll hold my
stuff again for ya. :-) 

If that's not convenient, here's something I've done in the past.

Wander into Qeynos, find an EMPTY building with a 2nd level.  Camp the
original character there.  Now, go get the new char, get him to the
same place.  Camp him there as well.
Back to the original character - log in, make sure nobody is around
(rarely in unused building 2nd floors), drop stuff on floor.  Quickly
camp and log on new one again and pick the stuff up.

If building's not convenient, just find some out of the way spot that
you can get both characters to safely and do the same thing.  Be
aware, wandering NPC's have been known to pick stuff up off the
ground... so make sure no guards or such wander through the area that
you are doing this with.

Truly, easiest is to find someone you can trust to hold stuff for you.
You could holler for myself, Beurlom or Medsolo and we'd help.  :-)

Something to ponder:  will your new char be the same type as the old
one?  If not, make sure that your current equipment will work with the
new character...

Cheers,
