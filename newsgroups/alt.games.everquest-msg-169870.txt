Well it might have to do with the class of character you are playing.
Sometimes different classes do better in different zones.  I went to
Mistmoor one time with a Warrior friend who spent a lot of time there with
his main, a Wizard.  We got clobbered.  There were just too many casters.
On the other hand I hunted in M Saru with both my Shaman and my Necro with
no problems at all.  I thought the exp was good.

The trick to M Saru is where you camp (like most places).  The Netherbian
zone line can get a little crazy.  Its better at the Sanctus zone, not as
many adds.  Also the Stonegrabbers are pretty mean and have a lot of HP-I
stuck to Greyhoppers and when they greened out I moved on.

Oh, by the way, what time of day is Paludal empty?  This is good information
to have.
