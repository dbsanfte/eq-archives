Yep.  Precia is from Magic Knights Rayearth, Tenjou is from Revolutionary
Girl Utena, and Mitsune is from Love Hina.  They all have meaning to me,
which is what counts.  No, I'm not going to choose a popular name, like Goku
or something.  These are inside references, and when someone gets them, I'm
glad.  Just like when I saw a monk named Nabiki in Upper Guk.  Didn't say
"what an unorignal name," but rather "hey, cool, a Ranma fan."

Never been mocked about my name.  I did not take kindly to your post
questioning my intellegence, and responded in kind.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
