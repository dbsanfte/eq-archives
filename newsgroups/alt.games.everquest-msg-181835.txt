    You learn? (Getting you nice and angry beforehand - this is Usenet,
after all!)

    I didn't, because my point wasn't about the agreement. It was about how
silly good those PoE bows are, and what people would do to get them.

    The leader of my guild, and the other guilds involved. Our initial
position was a one day rotation, just like Emperor had been, and their
initial position was unlimited attempts, don't you THINK about killing him
on us! As you can see, the final agreement was a compromise. ;-)

    Let's list the terms exactly, so there's no more insults framed as
questions. And this is the agreement all sides came to - this was not a
dictat.

    (1) Guild A has three days in which to kill RZ. Only Guild A may attempt
him. If Guild A kills him during this time, then next repop is Guild B's. If
Guild A kills him during this time, the loot is to go to my guild.
    (2) After the previous three days, if RZ is still up, Guild Alliance B
has three days in which to kill RZ. See terms as above.
    (3) After the previous three days, if RZ is still up, my guild has three
days to kill him. If he is killed, it becomes Guild A's turn.

    After step (3), guilds have 1 day in which to kill RZ, loot stays with
the guild that kills him, all other terms as above.

    Partway through the six days in which the other guilds were allowed
attempts, RZ was /killed across all servers because the encounter was being
exploited. Rather than exploit the technicality (you've had six days, neener
neener) it was agreed that the six days would resume when he was put back in
game. When he went back in game, he was still broken only this time broken
easy - and that's the day A and B teamed up, killed RZ, and split the loot
amongst themselves.

    Actually, I think it was done to gear up the members of my guild. Best
1HS and 2HS in game drop off that fellow, and weapons don't drop in Vex Thal
(at least not ones that are good outside of VT). I'm not counting his other
jaw-dropping loot because you can get alternatives to much of it in VT.

    Nice spin, Jazz. Since the pieces drop off XP mobs, we could go there at
the same time as they and farm should we choose. What gets me is it seems
one of the biggest reasons they're there is to farm bows for resale.

    /shrug. Then what should I say when I believe that one of the guilds is
there only because the guild leader wants a massive Paypal account?

    We know that it's the guildleader and a few select officers and not a
whole-guild thing. The members of that person's guild just do what their
guildleader tell them to do. But I don't fault them for following, it's what
you do. And what they told their members about the agreement sure differs
from what the agreement was, as shown to us by logs BEFORE things hit the
fan and as confirmed by tells to those leaders BEFORE things hit the fan.

    You should have read the VERY NEXT SENTENCE, where I say...

    Furor's position is as close to the "uberguild opinion" as you're going
to get. I don't agree with it. I don't care if Guild A managed to tag 200
people and throw them in a human wave at Rallos Zek. I do care when Guild A
agrees not to bring Guild B along, then goes back on that promise.

    "wasn't very long ago" = at least 15 months ago, since I've been with my
guild for that long. To put that in perspective, and to bring up your player
history as I'm apparently wont to do, have YOU been in ANY guild for that
long?

    Considering my guild was the second best guild on server when I joined,
not top dog, and I joined in November 2001 shortly after Luclin release, I
call BS on this.

    XP mobs, Jazz. Here, let me edumacate you on the suck that is Plane of
Earth:

    To spawn one of the ring events in PoEarth, you need to kill 18 mobs of
the same type (all blue), then 18 more mobs of the same type (all red) to
get the trigger. Kill a red before all blues are down, you've blown the ring
(no visible sign you've blown it) and have to wait to try again. Each ring
is tied to a specific type of mob. The mobs are spread all over the plane,
and spawn patterns are pretty dense. Unless Jesus is your puller, you will
kill mobs out-of-order and blow the rings all to hell and back. And since
you can't tell you've blown a ring until you try to do it and the trigger
doesn't pop....

    Now, the XP mobs also have random drops. Some are just for cash sales,
and some are for tradeskills. It's just like in every other PoP plane in
that regard. They're pulling these, and whatever else comes along, in the
hopes of getting stuff for bows. By so doing, they're messing up all the
events and making it damned-near impossible to actually do the key quest
there to move on to PoEarthB, home of the Rathe Council. We need to kill the
Rathe Council eventually if we're going to go to Time.

    See the problem?

    Rallos has one specific drop, the Blade of War, that makes him worth
doing once you're in the elemental planes. 2HS with whatever flavour of
Enraging Blow they put on it as a proc. Given that even "standard" nameds in
Fire hit for around 2000 per pop, having a high taunt 2HS for your warriors
is bordering on essential. Dual wield leads to twice as many ripostes leads
to surprise death very quickly.

    I think it's stupid. Very much like the Emperor, loot was placed on a
"gateway" mob that was not replaced by something else in the area beyond
that mob. But we have to work with what SOE gives us.

    It's a change from when we were there alone! Right after we killed
Rallos, people from my guild flooded into Earth, Air, and Water and in a
bout of stupidity rarely seen since, managed to train all three zones
simultaneously. After that, and the resulting tongue-lashing from people who
zoned into that mess, they were clean as a whistle.

    Again, see above with regards to Furor's comments. I'm not the one
calling them "zerg", because as far as I'm concerned dead is dead and as
long as you're happy with how the loot is spread out amongst that force more
power to you. But I don't like being called a "zerg" by server association
with these nitwits. The fourth guild killed RZ last night, BTW, with 55
people. The alliance of A and B wiped with 150 on their second kill, first
try. Do you think that fourth guild, which prides itself on skilled play
(killed Vindicator with eight people just before PoP release), is thrilled
to be considered to be from the "zerg" server?
