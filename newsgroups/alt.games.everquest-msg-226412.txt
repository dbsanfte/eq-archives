As I am sure others have already pointed out, any INT caster can research 
any of the WIS caster researchable spells, contrary to some bogus 
information floating around out there.

The components for the spells drop in pretty much any zone off of level 
appropriate mobs.  I have had them drop in The Hole, Veksar, Fungus 
Grove, Cazic Thule, Skyfire, Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, Temple of 
Veeshan, PoN just to name a few.  They do drop in the upper end LoY zones 
too.
