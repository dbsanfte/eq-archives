My paladin friend is the same way.  We've played with dozens of other tank
types using him as the MT.  They can taunt all they want, between his stuns and
uber weapons there is no chance they can get agro, they can still happily train
their skills, and I only have to heal *one* guy.  It works beautifully.  And I
have mana left over for buffs, debuffs, and nukes too!! :)
We don't wait until the group gets started, we say up front, "would you like to
join us?  We already have UberCoolBuffedBabe as MT but could sure use another
tank type".  No surprises.  (If we NEED a MT, I always say that too:  "Can you
be MT for a BOT group?")
This thread has gone *way* off on a tangent but I'm still not done....
IMHO, the needs of the *one* can most certainly outweigh the needs of the
*group*. (( Provided he isn't a danger to those around him. ))  And in a group
of friends most CERTAINLY the needs of the one USUALLY take precedence over the
needs of the many, because we are all working to achieve the same goal, be it
killing King Zod or working on a skill, or leveling our silly chanter.  He's a
perfect example:
I have a friend who is a *great, uber* wizard, and a shitty chanter.  He can't
keep track of the adds, he forgets to haste, and he's *always* daydreaming
during battle.  That was ok in his 30s and 40s, but deadly now that he's in his
50s.  We are powerlevelling this chanter so he can be our KEI guy, but he'll
NEVER be our choice for chanter in a group.   He knows that too, and agrees. 
Would you want a cleric in your group that didn't keep track of your health?  A
chanter who couldn't mez and forgot to haste?  A MT that couldn't keep agro or
hit the broad side of a barn with a boulder?  And keep in mind this person
isn't a friend, it's a *Stranger*.   
I've seen *dozens* of posts on just these kind of players making someone's
"ignore" list so I'm guessing the answer is usually a *no*.  
Ok, if that was a rant, i'm done.
