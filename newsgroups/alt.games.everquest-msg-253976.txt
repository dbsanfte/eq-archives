I found the same thing, (well, except that you wrote "does have any" 
when you meant "doesn't have any"), but felt differently about it.

The adventurer's stone starts out worthless, and grows into a nice 
augment if you continue to do lots and lot of LDoN's.  The Tutorial 
charm starts nice and will stay nice for a long time.  What this does is 
make the augment from LDoN worthless until you've got LOTS of LDoN's 
under your belt; instead of being a small boost to your existing charm, 
it would have to be slapped (as my previous character did) onto some 
almost worthless charm bought off an LDoN merchant; its going to be a 
long time before you can come up with even a half decent charm as a 
drop/quest item.

I'm shocked that the tutorial charm doesn't have a slot where you'd 
naturally put the LDoN charm augment, allowing the item to grow with 
you, at least up into the levels where you can hope to replace it with 
something better, namely the POP charm with several POP flags.  (likely 
we are talking over level 60)
