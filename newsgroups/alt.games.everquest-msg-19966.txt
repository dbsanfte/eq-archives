I have to add my two penneth worth here. I've been playing EverQuest for
only a week and half and I've made *so* many friends it's amazing. I'm on my
third attempt at a character at the moment, and whilst it's hard it's very
rewarding. I made a Wizard at started in Qeynos, just went outside the main
gates to start with, stood near the guards for protection if needed and
killed snakes. Sold what they dropped, leveled up, killed rats, looted,
leveled, went for some Gnoll Pus, looted, leveled and so on. Do as suggested
here and use the Consider button, just target your intended prey and weigh
up your chances. Make a HotButton that says 'Thank you' to those that do
help, as you'll find plenty of people that'll help you. Above all, take
things SLOWLY - and work HARD for your rewards, it's a big game, and a this
big game will (eventually) bring you rich rewards. If you get *really* stuck
go to my Website, Email me from there and I'll make a character with you and
we can hunt a bit together, at least until you get the hang of things ...

Regards ...

Stevi.
