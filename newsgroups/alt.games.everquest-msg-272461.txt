	Yes, it is.

	It seems to me that these changes will discourage pickup raids
(since you'll all want to be the same guild)  pickup groups (since
you'll all want to be the same guild) and make (those awful) casual
players feel even less able to participate: we already find it difficult
to progress beyond a certain point what with all the flagging and stuff
required.  

	Or heck, maybe I'll just start a new guild:  the Unguilded,
a guild that exists solely to procure a guild hall.  That really meets
the spirit of the thing.  Why should I have to do crap like that?

	I disagree.  At least, I've never found any meaningful guilds
that dont require such a commitment.  All the vital ones have minimum
standards for equipment, stats, and time on line.  Which makes sense.
Why have a club that no one shows up for?  Why have a guild just to get
a tag?

	I somehow manage to have fun in spite of the glaring and increasingly,
well, increasing problems.  I'm one of those dreadful casual players
who wants to log in when he can, have an hour or three of escape, and then
log off without feeling like he's ignoring his responsibilities.  I'm
one of those annoying paying customers who thinks that SOE should fix problems
as well as introducing new ones.  

	Maybe I shouldn't bother any more, I don't know.  Very few 
of the people I know do, even the ones in top end guilds.  But I've
put so very much time into it it would be like putting a pet to sleep...
