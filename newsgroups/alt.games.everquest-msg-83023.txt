>>> One of the village elders then goes on to try to get the crowd to figure
out how you test somebody to see if they are a witch and more stereotypical
Pythonesque hilarity ensues. <<<

Gotta love Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I'll go ahead and spoil the test
...

Witches burn because they are made of wood
Wood floats
Ducks float
Hence ....

"If she weighs as much as a duck, then she's made of wood. Then she's a
witch."

Incidentally, this is the same sketch as the infamous newt line.

"She turned me into a newt!"
"A newt?"
(short pause) "I got better."

"You might think I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence
I just encourage it."
