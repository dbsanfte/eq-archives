    Even if you decide against VT, farming Emperor keys opens up a lot of
opportunities. Everyone gets a very slick ring, you fill out your 56/58
Luclin spells and likely sell extras for a fair chunk of plat (seen how much
Blessed Armor of the Risen goes for?), and you will by the end of the
process have keys to be able to do Creator and Blood. Creator and Blood are
much easier fights than the Arch Lich you're trying now, and the drops are
better. You also get used to moving to the basement when doing Taskmasters,
which should make mobilizing for Cursed cycle (even if you can't kill
Cursed, Glyphed and Exiled could be in reach) faster.

    You can get the ring on first floor without a raid, too. But the
Insignias take a raid.

    Group composition determines function. For example, we recently moved
the shamans out of the CH groups and moved the cover CH person and a
necromancer in. Now the cover CH person (which can see the CH messages in
groupsay and react faster) is also the mod healer, and can cover that with
group heals - but we cannot use Torpor on modders. The necromancers can also
ask in group if anyone needs mana without spamming the entire raid and
getting tells back from people they shouldn't be feeding. Doing this changed
the dynamics of not only the CH group, but the raid as a whole.

    But myself and the other "strategy" cleric are really anal about things
like this. We think it helps - last night, our third Emperor kill ever, we
kept one main tank up the entire fight for the first time. A few tweeks to
our cleric group positioning and we feel that will become the norm, and not
the surprising exception. I don't think that a guild that isn't winning an
encounter can afford to have sub-optimal grouping - little things could be
killing you and it'll take forever to weed them out.

    Of course, on the weak stuff (to your guild) do whatever you like. Last
NToV trip a while ago I was a CH rotation cleric and I still got the
killshots on Feshlak and Dagarn. After a while of being a cleric you get
VERY good at reading how fast a health bar is decreasing. ;-)

out.

    I've seen other guilds peel people off Grieg and kill the repops - I
think we even did it for the first kill, until the enchanters asked if they
could try something. Knowing they can be charmed is a big boost to DPS.
