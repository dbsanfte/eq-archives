As a follow-up and comparison to this. Here's the stats for PoP Elemental
Warrior armour (Raex's whatever of Destruction). This gear drops in the
form of Elemental Molds, in PoP Elemental Planes and beyond.

Note : The Chest mold only drops in the Plane of Time (Rallos Zek and
Quarm) and the Greaves only drop from the EP Gods and the Plane of Time.
However, for completeness I'll include them both in the lists.

                            AC     HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347    910     70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452    1040    65
Armsmaster's                395    975     60
Raex's                      492    1335    65


As you can see, un-auged Raex's armour set is still significantly better
than any of the single-group armour sets from later expansions.

Remembering our type 9/12 augs however, allows us to improve the DoN GM
Armour and after that, they look like this,

                            AC  HP    Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347 1200  70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452 1330  70
Armsmaster's                395 975   60
Raex's                      492 1335  65


We can see the DoN GM armour, fully auged, is now only 5 hitpoints less
than a full set of Raex's Plate, and is significantly easier to obtain
(certainly in one respect, since it can all be purchased). We can also see
however that the Raex's armour is still streets ahead in terms of AC.

As with the later Armour sets, the Raex's armour has a number of additional
benefits and foci, which are listed below.

Raex's
    additional benefits   chest Echo of Anger / +8% riposte / 3% shielding
                          legs  attack +40 / regen +4
                          wrist attack +15
                          head  Faerune
                          hands attack +30 / regen +3
                          feet  attack +20 / regen +2
                          arms  attack +30 / regen +3


On the whole, the additional benefits are similar to the Armsmaster,
although there's more emphasis placed on attack and regen. The Breastplate
stands out however, with a Hate Modifier (Echo of Anger) and 3% shielding.

In summary, obtaining a full set of the DoN Cultural Armour will result in
a set of gear which comes close to, but doesn't quite match the quality of
Raex's. However, the Raex's set required Elemental Planes access and Plane
of Time access, and the ability to farm and kill EP Minis, EP Gods, and
Rallos Zek / Quarm in the Plane of Time.
