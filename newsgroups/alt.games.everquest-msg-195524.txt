Incessantly.

I generally know what I want/need, since I am only actively equipping my 
monk ( http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=266070 ) and I am 
getting to the point where only NODROP or 10k+ items are good upgrades. I 
also subscribe to Allakhazam, and use that as a good resource for upgrading 
stuff.

I even look up bits of gear I *can't* afford, just to right click and 
drool.
