The faction change and faction display functions have been nerfed in the
NG.

The only way to check your faction is to Hail the Faction leader.  If
he/she swipes at you you are KoS.  Any other response means you are
dubious or higher.  No response, means you have taken the KF faction
hit, and must complete either the restitution, or the Name change
quests.

Be ware, the Name change quest can result in further bad faction hits if
it isn't combined with the Apologize for being a moron quest.
