So, if they undercharge you the bill is a contract according to you,
but it's not when they overcharge you. How's that? It's the same paper,
namely the bill, it's the same situation, the seller billing the
customer. But it's not a contract in the other situation. Please
explain.

Not that I think a bill is a contract, mind you. When I sign a lease
for my apartment, the lease states what the price is per month. If the
person leasing it to me makes a typo and send me an lower bill, that
bill doesn't suddenly turn into a contract. The contract is still the
lease that I signed and I still owe him the difference.
