Just rebuilt my computer using an AMD 4400+ cpu.It seems that after a short 
time in game,say 10-30 minutes,my character animations freeze and my 
movement really speeds up.I can still play but it really is annoying.
So, is anyone else having this problem and if so what is the fix?

Thanks for any info,

DanD
