I'd love Jboots but the idea of sitting in Sro camping the AC for an 
entire day only to have it KS'd from me when it spawns doesn't sound 
worthwhile to me. Tboots might be a better idea though.

True. I should buy a few of these for emergencies when I don't want to 
gate back to bind.

Even in a good pulling place, Mage soloing is far from efficient. When 
soloing blue cons in DL at 41, I usually have to med most of my mana 
back, and let my pet regen most of his hp back after each pull. Most of 
the time I also have to renew summoning during the fight to keep the pet 
alive too. Once the pet dies, I either have to gate or run. Compare this 
to a Necro, Druid or Wizard.
