That's a great change!

In all sincerity, I think the buff system in EQ is amazingly flexible.
 It allows them to:

1) Have a new buff blocked by an existing, higher-level one
2) Have a new buff stack (effects add) to an existing buff as long as
the buff
   stats aren't in the same slot
3) Have a new high-level buff overwrite a lower-level buff
4) Have the new buff's stick and override the existing buff but not
get rid of it.  (Selo's over SoW, for example, or Sonorous Clouding
over Camouflage)
5) Have some of the new buff's features increase while leaving another
alone because it is lower.  (example: Rousing Rondo song existing with
Speed of Vallon)

I know it hasn't been easy for Sony to do this.  It must involve a lot
of tricky coding.
