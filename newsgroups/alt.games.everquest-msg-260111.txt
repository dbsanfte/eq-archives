Let me take this opportunity to redicule for repeating exactly what

And once again, you parrot exactly what I said as if *I* was the one
who wasn't pointing out what was happening.

Did you even read my post?

No, it's not. It's mentioning what it is going to be like. Does that
bother you in some way?

Sounds like you're jumping to a conclusion about people writing off
WoW as hopeless because of it. Guess you're acting like a fool too.

For all your vaunted experience in mmorpgs, all you've done is repeat
what I've said and make up some wild exaggerations.

Who said anything about "only"? Are you deliberately making up lies
now or just being stupid? The point is they are *there*, and
pretending that a credit card is going to keep them away simply makes
you look ignorant of mmorpgs, no matter how long you claim you've been
playing them.

In other words, you have none. On the other hand, I have seen these
idiots in all the other mmorpgs who *didn't* have the blizzard fanboy
machine behind them. And yet we must believe this noname who tells us
they magically won't be in WoW!

You're about ten years out of date with that argument. Perhaps when
you get a bit more experience with mmorpgs, you won't say such silly
things in the future. Yes, I know you claimed twenty five years of
mmorpg experience. You obviously didn't learn a fucking thing in any
of them.

Yep, it's definately you.
