Yep.  Rage dropped 2 hearts for me last week.  Another cleric took one
figuring on a short-cut.  I had to point out the only short-cut there
was theoretically not having to kill Ragefire x2... and since the
dragon often drops stuff that is useful to people at my low level,
seems a shame to skip that part.
