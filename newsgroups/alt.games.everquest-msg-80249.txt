Not correct, sorry.

Level plays almost as much of a factor in whether you can hit with a
melee or missile attack as it plays in whether or not you can cast on
something.  I say "almost" because you can, in principle, hit a mob
more than six levels above you, though you're going to be hitting for
minimum.

A Ranger attempting to bowkite a light red mob, never mind a deep red,
is going to die, or at best fail and escape.  He won't be able to keep
it snared, and even a thousand arrows won't deal any significant
damage.
