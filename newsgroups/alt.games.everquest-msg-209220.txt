Beggars can't be choosers :ï¿½) I remember there are some still blue at 55
when I last went thru there...No hope of solo'ing any further than that,
Crusaders would make mincemeat out of you.
If he's solo'd then he wouldn't exactly be used to group exp and AA exp
moves at an OK rate in there.
But yes, pretty sucky compared to anything you could do with a healer and
more.
