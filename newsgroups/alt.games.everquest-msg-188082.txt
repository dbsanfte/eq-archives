Unfortunately not. You only have a list of things you can say to choose
from, probably to protect children from unsavory conversation.  If you
get the full version you can supposedly chat but you have to do some
sort of complicated double agreement thing with the party who you want
to be able to chat with.  

As for biker bars, I didn't see any but I saw an awful lot of strangely
named buildings, remembering one named something like "Barnacle Bill's
Bucket of Bass" or something like that.

I actually tried out Toontown after reading the orginal post and found
it very good.  You get to beat up Salesbots (Telemarketers are my
favorite target), Bosses, Lawyers & Criminals.  By beat up I mean throw
pies, and shoot them with water pistols type stuff, although I did see
some characters with advanced weapons like dropping a 200 pound block of
iron on top of his enemies.  I was rather suprised at the level of
anti-establishment in the game represented by doing this.  I found it
very refreshing,  I almost considered buying into it.

Being someone's friend is easy enough, I got "friended" by something
like 20 people in my short 3 day trial, without even asking.  Also after
being friended you don't need to actually have them along to complete
any of the quests, basicly the quest *was* to get a friend, and kinda
like the end of the tutorial part.  As far as I can tell there's no down
side to being anyone's friend, so go out and be friendly!

The quests in the game were all very good, there's no camping but you do
have hunt down certain types of people for the quests.  I.E. if you
needed to destroy 5 telemarketers you could team up with someone else
who needed the same thing and you would both get credit for every
telemarketer you destroyed, or maybe they just needed salesbots you both
get cridit.  There's no XP or levels either, only skills, so if you are
in a group, you aren't any worse off having to divide anything amongst
each other.

The only downside I see is that it IS a kid's game mostly, so there
isn't a lot of stratagy involved, and there's not much in the way of
collecting Uber Items. There didn't seem to be any organized guilds or
whatnot, and it seemed fairly chaotic in the teaming up department, and
they should have made the quests able to be got by a group.  For
instance if I wanted to play with a friend, we might get incompatable
quests, like maybe I need to destroy telemarketers he might need to
destroy bosses.
