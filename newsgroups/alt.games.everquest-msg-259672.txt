Again, you prefer the alternative?

Not being able to sell it back at all, you would lose 1492 points, the
equivalent of *thirty* *normal* missions.

Due to the no-drop rules, it's pretty standard that when you upgrade your
gear in EQ, your previous stuff will either get the delete key or rot away
in your bank as CR gear.  Almost never do you get anything out of the time
you spent camping or raiding for the item  you just got upgraded.  Hell, I
can't even tribute my old gear. Getting a free 1000 points to play with
sounds damn nice.
