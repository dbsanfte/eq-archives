These things aren't important to us, what we need to know is;

What level is she and what loot does she drop. What zone is she in and is
there a Place Holder?

What clan does she play for and what mods does she play?

Does she prefer vert or street?

Sorry can't think of anything relevant for BG or FF. Clutching at straws on
the Skate board link too, I was never much of a skate boarder, preferred
in-line (I was a fruit booter as one of the engineers at work likes to call
me :ï¿½))
