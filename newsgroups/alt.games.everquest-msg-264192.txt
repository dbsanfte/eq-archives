For what it's worth, I never finished the free month. CoH has the best 
character creation screen of any MMORPG I've seen yet. Unfortunately, it 
turned out to be the most fun part about the game. If you thought EQ was 
a mindless, soul-destroying grind, CoH will take you to a whole new 
level of despair.

Mind you, to be fair, levels 1 to 4 are a lot of fun... you'll do those 
levels a lot of times.
