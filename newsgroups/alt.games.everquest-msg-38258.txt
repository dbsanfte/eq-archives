I am currently in Lake Rathe near the Arena zone. I've been told that this
area has some decent hunting for my LV (18).  What is some good advice for
what/where (which part of the zone) to hunt in?  What parts can be soloed?
What parts would I likely be able to find a group (early morning most often,
3AM-6 or 7AM Central time)?  I was hunting Aviaks by the Arena but then I
saw on a web site of the mobs that they're LV8-12 (they all conned green)
except for the guard who is LV16-20.  Should I camp the guard a little on my
own?  Is he worth the pp/loot/exp?  What parts of Rathe Mountains or
Southern Karana are good at my LV and hunting what?  I've never hunted this
area or spent any time in the zones (mountains, lake, s karana) except for
traveling to Arena for the best of the best tournaments, and spending a
little while running all over Rathe Mountains as a LV6 Ogre Warrior (looking
for corpse because he ran into one of the sphinx things and didn't know what
it was or where in the zone it was -- that's where I learned how to find
maps) training nearly every hungry click-clacking beetle on my tasty butt.
