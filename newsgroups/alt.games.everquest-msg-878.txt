There are an awful lot of high levels out there who just get a charge
out of drive by acts of this nature.  (I can't count the times I've been
breezed/sowed/buffed just sitting medding.  I also still carry the mithril
quill that Longinus gave me, I was selling him 15 or so HQ cat pelts
and he just threw it in.  Said I needed a pen :-)  More likely he saw I was
using a summoned weapon (had some bad luck)).  The people who get
upset about your having these items aren't worth worrying about.  Enjoy
them in the spirit in which they were given, and when you reach lofty
heights, find some other worthy lowbie and make his day.
