No.

Basically someone like transgaming will have to make directx 8 work
on linux somehow for EQ to work, good luck with that.

My prediction is that if anyone ever finally gets direct x 8.1 to work
under linux, so you can play direct x 8.1 windows games (if you have
all the dlls and junk for windows, as you'd have on a multiboot
system) that a week or so later microsoft would come out with direct x
9 in order to cripple that and a month after that Verant would make EQ
so it needed dx 9 to run.
