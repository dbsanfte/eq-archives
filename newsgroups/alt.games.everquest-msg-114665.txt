Where a ToV bp is concerned (or *any* ToV loot for that), there is no
mezzing of adds, period.

So the enchanter finds a better raiding guild (if raiding is what they wish
to do).
My guild refunds anybody for Dot/gem costs (usually up-front too in the form
of dots to use for raids)

> 'nothing enchanter specific' dropped.

So the chanter should get a shot at something class specific, that is a
definate upgrade for a guildie?  Oh please.
Tell you what, I'll come raid with you.. when that silk robe drops, Im going
to apply for it against you, I mean I can MQ it with my twink

Sounds like you need to find better people to raid with.

When your given some loot, its the guilds loot.  When that item is upgraded,
you give your old loot to the guild, as a hand-down for somebody else.

Say some 40% haste booties drop...  grats person 1, that person then hands
down their CoF to person 2.  Person 2 then hands down their RBB to person 3.
Person 3 then hands his RBG down to person 4

Thats at least *4* people benefiting from *1* loot drop.
