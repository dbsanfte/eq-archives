I'm not saying that the hypothetical pirate has any right to enjoy that 
music, but you cannot argue that the artist is left any worse off if the 
pirate had no intention to buy the music anyway.

For myself, I can only say that I am astonished and somewhat terrified 
at the results of this evening's experiments.  Astonished at the 
wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so 
much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.
-- Sir Arthur Sullivan, message to Edison, 1888
