>I'm new to the game, what is proc?
It's an abbreviation for "process" - a term used to describe a weapon
activating it's built-in spell effect during a combat.  The weapon
will more often than not "proc" only when the wielder is a specific
level and prior to that level you will somtimes see a message saying
"Your will is not sufficient to command this weapon" (or something
along those lines).  Essentially, the weapon WOULD have used it's
built-in effect at that point if you'd only been high enough in level.

For example, say you have a weapon that will cast a Fear spell during
combat when your character is level 30...  Under level 30 you might
see the "Your will" message a few times during combat, but nothing
else; then at 30 or over, the weapon will randomly trigger ("proc")
it's effect.

I think I am correct in saying that the higher a character's
Dexterity, the more often it will "proc" but I may be in error.

Hope that helps  :)
