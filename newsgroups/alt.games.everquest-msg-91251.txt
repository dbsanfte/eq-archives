<sarcasm> The complexities of running a MMORPG are simply too much for any
of you to fathom.  There a multple servers, databases, and network
periphials that must act in unison, much less the dependency on outside
sources of bandwidth.

We should all feel blessed that Verant even makes the attempt.  At US$9.85
per month, per user, that simply is NOT ENOUGH to provide the infrastructure
required.  Why, the counter sales alone of the the retail box is barely
enough to cover the cost of ONE server!!!

Other companies' products like DAoC, and AC are EASY to "simulate" good
service.  Look at their paltry user bases.  </sarcasm>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In the long run, it does not really matter if Verant's EQ is down or not.
For the most part, they deliver a quality product at a fair price.  Despite
my grumblings about them being down when *I* want to play, the fact remains
that it *IS* frustrating with the seemingly constant problems (especially
those in the Prexus community).

The end, if you are tired of it... leave... if you are like the die-hards
that STILL play a game called The Realm, you'll never go until they pull the
plug.

Me?  Well, my monk will sit on Prexus, and will play when able.  My Armsman
is progressing nicely, and I do enjoy DAoC.  If I get to the point that I
eschew EQ, (would miss all of my friends), you can BET my 41 monk, 33 druid,
27 cleric, 18 pally, 10 sk, 41 ranger, 29 shaman, and other lower chars (all
twinked on two accounts on Prexus) will have Christmas in Misty Thicket and
Warsaliks Woods.  (Yes, I'll pick a nice quiet, out of the way place, and
start sending random tells to people on the server.)

Until that day, or *IF* that day comes, I'll keep adding levels and items as
I continue.
