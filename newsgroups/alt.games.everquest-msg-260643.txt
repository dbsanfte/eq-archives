Closer to 10 seconds for me, it seems, with no AAs.  Anyway, I tried
my experiment of spamming a key that included (a) a self-tell so I'd
know exactly how many times I tried to feign, and (b) a pause before
the tell so the hotkey wouldn't recycle until FD was ready again, so
I'd know each tell matched exactly one attempt.

Left it autofiring for a few hours in PoK and South Qeynos, gathering
799 samples.  My skill isn't maxed yet, alas, so I didn't get a big
sample at any one skill level (about 100 on average at each skill from
189 to 196), so I don't really have enough data to tell whether the
failure rate is going down as I skill up.  But the overall failure
rate was 31 out of 799, or 3.88%.  If the programmed failure rate was
really 5% (or higher), I'd expect more than 31 failures (out of 799)
more than 90% of the time.  Not solid proof, but I suspect the rate
is under 5%, at least in those zones.

Failure rate in PoK was 3.96%; in SQ (the larger sample) it was 3.86%.
Close enough that I expect those zones are the same.
