Hmmm I don't know really. I don't like ebay or people auctioning to
sell things for real money because it opens up the possibility to be
defrauded and having to trust someone you don't know, probably a punk
kid, on the internet.

However, if verant suddenly said "You can now buy things like a
lodizal shield for 10 dollars, it is simply added on to your EQ
subscription credit card number after you select to buy it. This can
be done from the options screen"  would you? I'd be sorely tempted in
the case of an item like that, which I would really want, for just a
10 dollar one time charge THROUGH verant itself.

Actually if verant had done that instead of a 3 dollar price hike:

1) they would actually make more money

2) customers would not be as pissed since it would be fully your
choice if you wanted to buy a lodizal shield for 10 bucks

3) you'd no longer see outrageous in game prices on such items so the
economy would improve

4) you'd no longer see people being defrauded as much to trade scams
in game or on the internet when they were desperate for an item

5) people with full time jobs who were busy and did not have the time
to camp the lodizal shield, or the guild resources, would see 10 bucks
as nothing and actually be happier gamers for it.

Of course there would also be the bad side:

1) a gamemaker selling virtual objects in its game for real money, 
on top of your monthly subscription price, seems pretty seedy

2) some of the money people make in game would severely plummit,
making the game not as fun for them.

3) based on the crack like addiction of the game, this could lead to
bad behavior (especially from teens) such as using mommy and daddy's
credit card for the 50 dollar fungi tunic charge or stealing money
from their family in other ways.

4) perhaps worst of all it would remove much of the incentive to go
and be "uber' getting these things yourself. Some guy would say "hey
anyone want to help me with my epic?" and his guild would reply "Uhh
just buy it for 100 bucks like everyone else, you cheap bastard!
