I can't tell if you're serious or trolling.   It's certainly the case that if
100% uptime is your main requirement, you'll sometimes be disappointed with
any of the MMO offerings out there.  Stick with single-player games (oh,
and only older ones with no server authentication/registration reqired, and
all the patches to make them playable already done).

If you want interaction with other players and online persistent gameplay,
you're going to put up with some amount of unavailabilty.  I don't know of ANY
that aren't going to be down sometimes.

Personally, unless you're going to dedicate all your free time to a game, and
take days off specifically to play it, this seems like a minor consideration.
If you ARE obsessive about a single game, choosing one that's likely to be
more available is still probably less important than the actual gameplay and
social environment that allows you to pour your life into it.
