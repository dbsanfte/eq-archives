Ok, up to this point I've mainly soloed, but I do realize that I'm
going to have ("Have" might be a kind of strong word) to group soon.
My role in a group, as I understand it, is that of a damage dealer,
NOT a tank.  As a damage dealer, I have to be able to take some hits,
thus the need for good AC.  HP is nice, but I don't see that as
something that is a necessity since that if I'm getting hit on THAT
much, there is something wrong with whatever group I'm in.  

I want STR since that does have a reasonable effect on melee output,
and it gives me the ability to haul around more phat lewt.  :-)

Dex was higher on the list for purely personal reasons, in that I
really like the idea of my ranger being an archer and I was under the
impression that Dex had a greater impact on just the regular archery
skill.  Since this is apparently untrue, I guess that Wis goes in my
#4 slot, but personally I don't see Wis as a make or break stat for
any item I'm going to get.  Mana for a ranger (in my VERY limited
experience) seems to be mainly for utility.  Buffs and heals, and in
three LONG levels, SoW.  Just stuff to reduce downtime.  The only two
spells I use regularly in combat are Snare and Root, and neither is
any kind of a mana drain.  My ranger only has 88 Wis at the moment,
and I have NO problem taking him into a fight with only 1 bub of mana.

All this said, I'm not saying you're wrong.  Since your ranger is only
THIRTY levels higher than mine, you obviously know more about the
class.  I'm only trying to explain how I am approaching my character.
It is very likely that my view on this will change.  Your help and
input is GREATLY appreciated.
