I would further this by saying bring, from your EQ directory at home:

<charactername>.*

and you might also want to add:
eqclient.ini
(or even)
*.ini

from home, and dropping them in your EQ directory at your office.
Since I think there's a couple of files which make up the key maps, and
socials of a given character.
