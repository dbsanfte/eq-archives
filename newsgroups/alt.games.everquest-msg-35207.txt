    You are cordially invited to attend my wedding
 Sunday the First of September at 6 pm Pacific Time 
 in Nro at the docks near the pirate (Frankle?) on
 Drinal server.
    Tealeef the Barbarian will be marrying Lennaman
 the Troll.  All characters, good or evil, are
 welcome.  Wedding presents are not expected; we
 just want people to have a good time.  Level 1
 wedding mules are certainly welcome.  This spot
 is near Freeport, and not too many MoBs wander by
 the beach so all should be safe enough.

Note:  A few hours ago, I post this exact message,
with the exception that the date was this coming
Sunday, Aug the the 26th.  The guide I spoke with
said we had to give them a weeks notification, so
I changed the date.  I hope this cause no problems 
for anyone.
 
 Annie   <--- Now has to go /auction for some Cake.
