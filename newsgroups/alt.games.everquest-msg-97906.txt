The two of those -should- eliminate the biggest worry I had
about messages going through when the character was
zoning.   It's fairly simple when rezzing on raids to simply
"/ttell Prepare for rez" and click the rez as soon as the
message was received.

No conversation required, just rez as fast as the cast takes.
And you knew the other person had zoned because the /ttell
went through.  So I really hope this works as described because
it's going to make raid rezzing a bit more trouble if it doesn't.
It's really been SO much easier to click, click, click to rez w/o
having to wait on a response before clicking the rez.

I hope they missed a "and added a switch in the interface to
toggle it" in the patch message.   Yes, setting a line in the ini
file isn't that difficult, but I'd bet most people will still go
through the options screen rather than fire up an editor if
they can't use the in-game ini file interface.
