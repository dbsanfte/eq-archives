yeah, I think they fixed the kicked to desktop issue... I have not had
any issue with that since last patch.... but I have noticed a larg
amout of lag in bazaar (no not by the framerates, but by the
Lag-o-meter)  It will go to 100 % lag then back down to 30 then up to
70 then back to 0...   and I have been getting kicked out to server
selection alot more often now (read multiple times a day)
