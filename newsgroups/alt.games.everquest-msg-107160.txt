Nope, cause then he clarified it at a recent fan faire, also at
caster's realm. So you have to look at the most recent story he told,
sort of ;) He now says only your skill makes a difference but the
other stuff just helps with increasing skill points. I think he
checked into it more after players looked at that info and said,
"uhh.. no." People were finding that in hundreds of tests having a
huge bunch o' str or int/wis was not actually giving them more
successes. Kinda makes you wonder when even the guy in charge of it
gets it wrong. If you read it carefully though, he could have meant
above the chance of success of raising a skill point but I think he
was just mistaken.

"TRADESKILLS: FROM THE DALLAS FAN FAIRE, FEBRUARY 1, 2002 
Dan Enright, otherwise known as Yakatizma, headed up the Tradeskills
panel at the Dallas Fan Faire."

"Questions

Regarding Trivials.  On some items I will succeed a bunch of times,
then I will fail a bunch in a row.  Even though sometimes it says it
is trivial.

"There is always a 5% chance of failure regardless of your skill or
its trivial.  But there is no stat which has an effect on success
rate, stats just impact on how quickly you learn the skill."
