I have played both for more than 2 years.
UO has its advantage in some great PvP and some fun monsters with a
mediochre loot system. Its downside is that its extremely dated graphics are
jerky as hell and look like something that a Gameboy color would have no
trouble running. Also the game is rife with scammers and hackers. UO will
die off gradually as its subscriber base decreases. I'm sure they have very
few truly new subscribers.

EQ appeals to me more. The graphics, even the older graphics are far
superieor to UO and the gameplay is more fun too. I am kinda tired so I cant
really be bothered to explain all the goods and bads of EQ but if you want
something that is gonna be around in 2 years, get EQ. If you want something
that dosnt have rinky dink graphics get EQ. If you want a huge variety of
spells and a great magic item base, get EQ. If you want a huge world to
explore, get EQ. If you want lots of great looking mobs, fun raids and less
lag, get EQ.

Get EQ.
