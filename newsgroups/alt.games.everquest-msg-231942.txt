That's sort of the whole point of PoK, what with it (probably) being
Zebuxoruk's city/plane and all that.

From the EQLive site: "There is said to be a hidden city on Norrath that
honor, not worship, the 'Ungod', Zebuxoruk. Something not even he truly cares
for. This city has knowledge of his history both true and false and the
community is mostly comprised of fallen priests, shadowknight, paladins, any
who have been forsaken by thier deities and either seek a pathway back or seek
true neutrality among the planes and and understanding that the deities are
more mortal than they think."
