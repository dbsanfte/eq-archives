It's my understanding that "spying" on troublesome players is exactly why
GM's go /anon the way they do.  That way, the trainer/KS'er/whatever can't
do a /w in the zone and see a GM and decide to shape up all of a sudden.
It gives GM's a chance to move around in secret, and probably cuts down on
the number of /tells they no doubt get bombarded with.
