They weren't using tactics. They were exploiting pathfinding. What
they were doing is no different than someone nuking guards from a
rooftop in Freeport, and when they catch you doing that, they'll warn
you for it, and if the incident is serious enough, they'll ban you.

The excuse the guild tried to use was that the guy was still summoning
so it was okay. But he couldn't get down under the bridge.

There was lots of blame to go around and Verant didn't do everything
right either, but that guild was as guilty as a fox in a henhouse.
