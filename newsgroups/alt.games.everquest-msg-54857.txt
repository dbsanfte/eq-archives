What on Kerra were you taking out. I went from 20 to 23 there with my
ranger (and found it an excellent zone since on Torvonnilous virtually
no-one goes there..I saw 4 people in those 3 levels). I reckon I could go
back and still keep hunting up the centre areas and the tiger isle/trainer
area there. If you are soloing the way you call t then that whole zone
should be a never ending exp cow to you for a few more levels from 20.
