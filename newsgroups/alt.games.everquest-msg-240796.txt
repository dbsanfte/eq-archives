Shoot, was hoping to be able to wait until a set later than 56.64 was
released as many seem to be having problems with them. I found that with
53.03, even with in game gamma set to 100% it was too dark to see most
of the time. When I exited the game, my desktop was so bright I could
hardly see anything let alone read it. Had to set gamma to 50% there as
the settings still showed it at 100 where it was before. I hate patch
days, grumble, grumble, lol!
