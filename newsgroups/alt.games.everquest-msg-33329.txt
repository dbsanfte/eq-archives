Hes triggered from the necros death.
Someone complains that he dont even spawn then sometimes, and you have to
kill the necro again to get him to spawn.

Hehe, sometimes people are just REALLY unlucky to be in the wrong spot
when a mob spawn, was camping Gynok once, and after waiting 8 hours he
spawned. Around 1 sec after a level 11 rogue zoned in, and was killed
before my first spell could hit Gynok.

Have also been unlucky enough to sit in EK myself, and get Broon (or is is
Droon, the second of the giants) pop just on top of me, and slaying me
before i could get over the bridge to NK.
