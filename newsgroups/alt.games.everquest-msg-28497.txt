A counts for far more . Its a shame you cant see that . Mister A is likely
to be the person who owns 3 accounts . Mister A is likely to be far more
deeply involved and care about the game . Mister B wont step foot in that
dungeon no matter how you try to get him there.

The trivial loot code does not prevent farming by either high or low
characters .(FARMER- any person or persons camping a specific place for a
specific item drop with the intent to sell or trade that item many times)

The trivial loot code does punish people for playing when they want an item
to wear .(not a farmer , need just one , gets then gets gone)

The trivial loot code actually encourages the making of new farmers and
rewards farming beyond the farmers wildest dreams. ( widget 546 drops here?
good god im glad im the only one who knows that and that I am at exactly the
right level to get 87954350981745 of them)

The trivial loot code breaks whatever tenous frail hold the roleplayers had
on suspension of disbelief. After roleplaying dies EQ is just a video game
and a bad one at that. Yo mister 60 ! get your ass back in sandox 14 , you
are too tall to play with little jenny`s toys.
