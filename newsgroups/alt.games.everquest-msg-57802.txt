Bob,

Leaving aside the validity or otherwise of your post (Which I freely
admit I know nothing about), it is regarded "rude" to pop up and attempt
to kick the regulars in the nuts. If I were you I would expect some fall
out from this.

My question to you is have you ever read this group before or did you
just figure out how to post a message ?

HTH,

Jim
