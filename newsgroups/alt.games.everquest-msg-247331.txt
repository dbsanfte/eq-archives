Hm, on my normal server, sol ro, it seems the aviak village is called 
'aviacs' or 'kfc' or 'birdtown' dpending on who you are talking with.

I commonly will just say 'alting' or 'going to go into an alt' when I 
change characters and people seem to understand just fine. most people I 
play with will call it 'going to change alts' and one or 2 occasionally 
call it a toon.

I occasionally have to ask people what they mean by camp names if I am 
new to a zone, but generally they are ok with explaining which camp they 
are using. I dislike just calling camps by the initials..
