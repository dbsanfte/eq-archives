    Ok, I'm really new to this game.  I bought the tri pack a month or so
ago and have been working on a couple of characters, scrapped them, and now
for the majority of my time with Everquest I've been playing a human wizard
which is now level ten.  I got him ported into Greater Faydark "sorry if I
misspelled it" where I could gain some levels in Crush Bone.  I'm on the
zebrak server "not sure if I spelled that right."  I've been searching
endlessly for some silk armor since I can't wear leather and someone said
this was the sort of armor I should get next.  No store carries them.  Could
someone be of help?

Thanks
