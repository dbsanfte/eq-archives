Oh please like this will change that happening.
The crowd will still go to the most popular zones (like LOIO etc.)
The under used zones will still be underused.

Look at kerran isle.
Tox is next door so anyone can get a port there from the moon.
There are towns one zone off for both good an eivl.
It has a 20% xp bonus and as far as I can tell it is the best place to
level from about 12 through 18.
I have yet to see over 3 people in zone.

Sometimes I have been there for 3 hours with no visitors.

I am sure that many others can list under used zones all over the planet
(and the moon)
