'Feels Clumsy' is subjective. That's what I mean by vague.

With OE I click 'Message/Block Sender' (2 clicks)

As an IT professional I stay on top of MS security holes. Most are
Explorer/ISS related. Believe me, I stick with Linux/Apache web serving
solutions. Free and 'relatively' secure. OE has few security issues (that I
know of), mainly because of its limited features (score one for DT!). The
HTML thing is a problem but doesn't make OE any less effective in displaying
text-based news messages.

By 'vague' I mean to imply that people should be given either all the
relevant facts or warned ahead of time that the views expressed are
subjective and not a universal truth.

Like top-posting. Yes it's a Usenet standard, but all forms of communication
are subject to change. Like many others here I have been using newsgroups
for 10 years or more (man, I feel old), but have evolved with the times.

I mainly understand that there are no standards when it comes to
communication. One of the things I like about OE is that it actually
encourages folks to use their newsfeeds. Many groups I used to frequent are
thinning out, victims of the 'Web Based Forum' plague! Maybe we can share a
hatred for those horrible, PITA, moderated, troll-bait blemishes on the net!

Knowest thou what I mean?
