Its never happened to me and I've been playing since the game came out.
But I have been hit with the fall for 10000 dmg bug under the world a couple
times.

Anyway you should have done a /report if you didn't because it copies the
last 10 lines of text  (including the loc I would assume) to whoever can
bring up the log,  thus proving beyond a doubt to Verant that it is in fact
a bug that they need to fix.
