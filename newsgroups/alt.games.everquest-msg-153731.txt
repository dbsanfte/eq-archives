OK, there's a class out there with FD and plate
armor.  IF monks can no longer pull effectively
because they get beat into a bloody pulp on
the way back, then perhaps SK have suddenly
become far more desirable.

SK FD isn't as reliable as monk FD, which
has always hampered them in relation to the
leather boys, but if monks are going to start
using RD to ditch aggro, perhaps a class
with real damage mitigation, real HP totals,
and a real pulling instrument or several...

SK have bows for long range reach out and
touch, compared to monk Throw.

SK have snare.  Not a good snare, but
helpful in bringing back mobs without
getting beat on too much, and very helpful
in splitting.

SK have complained repeatedly that they
have no real role in the high end game, with
Warriors as MA, Paladins as SA, rogues,
rangers, and monks as damage dealers,
and now clerics outdamaging them.... but
if monks stop being the premier pulling class,
then perhaps SK finally get some respect.
