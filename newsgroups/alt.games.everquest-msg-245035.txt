Much like your own guild, my guild was a friendly guild that got
more serious, as we worked out that we actually had a decently
skilled group of players. We migrated from totally casual raiding
to having fixed raid nights, and that caused a certain amount of
fuss, with a few people moving on. In the end, we got to the
point where LC stopped working for us with the people that put
in the time not feeling like they were being rewarded in proportion.

So we switched to DKP, and in hindsight it was something we
should have done earlier. It was basically a shot in the arm for
the guild, tightening up raid groups, bringing back a sense of
working together... best move we made. Our particular strategy
was to give out lots of DKP (about 60 per raid) and then holding
auctions. The breakdown was something like 5 points for a fail,
10 for a win, with the first fail and win being worth double (to
encourage progression) 10 for being there from port out to port
back (to encourage timeliness and endurance) and 10 points per
hour for any "non-boss" farming (to encourage people to participate
beyond their own personal gains such as flagging/keying etc). This
may or may not work for your guild, obviously you have your own
goals and can tune it to them.

My one tip is that you put the rules on the guild messageboard
early, let people familiarise themselves and ask questions so there
are no arguments and surprises at raid time. Also run the system
alongside LC for a couple of weeks  (IE you can score points
but not spend them) to rack up some points and get people used
to the idea.
