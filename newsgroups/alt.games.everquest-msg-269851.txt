Just thought of one more rp related question:

How much rping actually goes on on those servers?  There were a couple posts
about non-rpers on the rp server, and Bob Perez said that that might be
because AB is the first server listed alphebetically.  This actually sounds
like a valid reason to me.  When I first started playing EQ, I just picked
the first server on the list because I knew I'd never remember the name of
my server if I'd picked one farther down, 'course after I got the basics
down I moved to FV, but where I ended up isn't really the point...Anyway, I
guess there are 2 rp servers then?  Anyone know which has more roleplaying
or are they pretty much the same?  Thanks again!
