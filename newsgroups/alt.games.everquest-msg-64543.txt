  Strange.  Is this machine of yours upgraded to Windows Me from Windows 95
(and previously from an earlier version of Windows/DOS?)  Ever since Windows
95, Windows has built in support for FAT32, which should be able to address
a hard drive many gigabytes large.  You'd only need to divide your hard
drive up in to smaller partitions if you're using FAT16.  You might want to
try some sort of partitioning software (Partition Magic is popular, though
it'll run you about $70 last I checked) to covert to FAT32 and combine all
of those partitions in to one.  I'm pretty sure that should be possible
without loss of data.  There is other software out there which will do the
same thing, but when you're messing with system-level stuff like partitions,
you want to use proven software, especially if you're a novice with this
sort of thing.

  Or, if EQ and Windows are all you have on your machine, you could try
reformatting your hard drive and reinstalling Windows and EQ from scratch.

  I don't have any idea how one would get Luclin to run off several
drives... my guess would be that it simply isn't possible.  I'd try EQ
support to make sure, or maybe somebody here will come up with some
ingenious trick.  Good luck.
