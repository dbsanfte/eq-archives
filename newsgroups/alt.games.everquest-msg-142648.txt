Nah...because Escape works only if you can get away from everything.
THEN you can do it...and it only works once every hour or so.  And in some
places, it's not worth it to Escape in the first place...lose aggro from the
Queen, and one of the see-invis dogs will bitch slap you as you wander out.
Escape from a(nother) failed VS raid, and run into a construct of Sathir
that
thinks you are interesting.  Etc...not to mention the impossibility of
dragging
a corpse out of the good places in Kael/Skyshrine/etc.

Escape IS nice...but I have to admit I'd trade it for a 72 minute refresh
simple FD.  The ability to basically stop fighting at will and then /q (like
when
your sig. other is whining) is nice :-).
