Subject: The "transparent screen".  One more time please

Ok I figured out how to use the " ` " to get rid of the transparent screens. 
Which I thought was cool.  But the other day I wanted to go into "advanced"
skills so I tried to go BACK to the transparent screens and couldn't get it to
work:
I hit the " ` " ... I got a message saying "full screen poly transparancies are
now on", (or words to that effect...) but the transparencies aren't back. 
Logging off and re-entering hasn't worked either.
Any advice?
(NOTE:  This is why I never try to "adjust" my computer settings... sigh).
