Yes, and everfrost now too. 

It lowers you to scowl in new areas starting with kunark, so don't use
it in firiona vie city either and DON'T come out of thurg and cast
wolf form right inbetween those two dwarf sentries there. I saw this
once and it was actually pretty funny how fast the person died.

What you do is gradually raise the faction, then periodically target
the thing, use wolf form (since its self only.. works without you as
target) then con the thing. LIke Im max allied with thurg dwarves now,
in wolf form i'm warmly (same with the skyshrine dragons which are COV
faction)

I think I'm warmly in firiona vie now and amiable in wolf form.

It still works the opposite way in Unrest and makes you indiff, which
makes for some very relaxing camping when bored.
