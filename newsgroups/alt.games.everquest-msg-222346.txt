Yes, you can.  Because the game's been dumbed down to the point
where you don't lose your body or any exp on death, so even a
naked necro with only two level one spells can make it to eleven
given a bit of time.  After that point you need to be able to get
more exp per hour than you lose dying.

I'm not even complaining really, I just saw the two posts, a
couple minutes apart, one I thought the guy was level one and
suddenly here he was 6th already!
