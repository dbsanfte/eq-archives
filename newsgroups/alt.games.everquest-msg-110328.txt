You raise an interesting point, however, if that were an exploit, then
any buff would be an exploit as well. Lev was DESIGNED to give you
certain advantages over mobs. What skill/ability/game aspect - put in
the game by design and with intent - were they using by hiding under
the protection of the bridge? None. It was cheating. What, there is no
way the mob was supposed to be able know anyone was under the bridge?
If it did discover them, it was not supposed to be able to get to them
- even with a summon spell? Please.
