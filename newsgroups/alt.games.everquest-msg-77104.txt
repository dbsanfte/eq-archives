It's a matter of perspective and play style....

Enchanters need high CHA for many of their most important spells, as
well as the need for cheaper prices from vendors when doing Jewelcraft
(most Ench make Jewelry).

INT determines the total mana pool of an int-caster. So the higher the
INT the more total mana a caster has. At level 16 Enchanters get
Breeze which increases mana regen which lessons the need for a high
base INT.

You will find more +INT items with other needed stats (ie +mana, or
resists, or AC) than +CHA. There a tons of +INT items that are usable
by all INT casters. So once you reach the mid level game you can boost
a low starting INT much easier than a low CHA without sacrificing
other important stats. An enchanter will also have Clarity and other
spells to boost their personal mana-pool.

When it comes to total mana-pool, having the most INT is not an
absolute  "requirement". 

Use the mana calculator at eq.castersrealm.com and see how much more
mana a level 1 Erudite with 142 stating INT has compared to a level 1
Human with 110. Then check at levels 20, 30, 40 and 50. You will see
that the difference comes down to maybe 1-2 spells. 

Casters that burn a whole bar of mana in a single fight are looking
death straight in the face. Especially casters that do not have strong
pets, or rely on root to hold back the mobs. When the crap hits the
fan most casters will gate of fiegn death (if a necro) long before
going OOM. An experienced caster will know long before being close to
OOM if they need to get out of the fight. Being able to cast 1 or 2
more spells (due to a higher INT) can make the difference between
surviving or seeing "Loading Please Wait", but such a situation rarely
comes up if an INT caster knows how to play thier class well.
