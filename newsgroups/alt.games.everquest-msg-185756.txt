Why are you proud of having a CHA of 13? It doesn't affect your fear, 
and it makes everything incredibly expensive.

Frankly, since the nerf in POJ, I've been trying to get groups whenever 
I can. I haven't found a good spot to solo or hunt with my wizard 
partner without hunting mostly light blues.

Although, if it's not horribly overcamped, you can try Chardok entry.
