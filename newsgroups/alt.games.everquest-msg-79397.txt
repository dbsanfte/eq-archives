In general, yes - in every player/mob based fight that is true, never
doubted that - as I pointed out in my reply to bizbee:
i can not roleplay here - so i would have to go to a pvp server,
which i tried and found that people usually kill you as soon as
they can because they play twinks/purposefully delevelled stuff.

Since on a blue server I cannot fight the people directly,
it should be perfectly alright to train guards on people fighting
guards where they (the ppl) plainly shouldn't be.

I don't even want to train them, I would be fully satisfied if
guards maybe got a tag that people could heal/buff them.

If restricted to guards, there shouldn't be much chance of abuse
there... But I see there's much more involved than just a simple
change of rules - to prevent all the possible abuse.

But anyways - if someone fights guards in my hometown,
I want to be able to do _something_ painful to them.

So where is the point? It wasn't that _I_ (Lars) had to grind
my teeth - it was Maliciosa the Teir'Dal!

The real person would probably not care a f*ck about
several animated pixel-Teir'Dals corpses on the pixel ground
in the pixel world of Norrath.

I want to live my character when I play EQ, I don't want to tell
myself all the time "hey, in your real life this game has no meaning,
hey - you just got a Scythe of Shadowed Souls,
a so called epic - so what??"
That takes the fun out of the game, you understand?
As well as having to see some human/dwarf couple killing
Teir'Dal in the midst of our hometown- think of the mental
damage inflicted on the newbies!!!

tsk - I still claim you didn't get my point...
