Can't help with your ATI gamma problem, but this I can tell you. The
"aqualungs" you speak of are called Rebreathers in EQ. They are not
available at merchants, but are only player made by PCs with a very high
Tinkering ability. The average price for them seems to be around 2K
each, though I just got a pair for 1.5K each on Xev last week.  Not much
demand for them though, except for the warrior epic, so you have to
scrounge to find them.

That said, there are much better options for what you desire. The
rebreathers are VERY heavy (ten stone) and take up your head slot rather
than allowing you to wear a helm or other armor there. Frankly, they
suck for what they were designed to do. You're looking for an effect of
permanent extended breath, allowing you to stay underwater, or in an
airless zone such as The Grey on Luclin. There are earrings, such as the
fishbone earring that drops off a rare mob in Q.Hills, along with other
items which you can obtain that will give you this effect more cheaply
and efficiently than rebreathers.
