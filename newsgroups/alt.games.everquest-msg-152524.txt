Maybe because caster balance changes DIDN'T depend on high end drops and
AAs?

The focus effects were a HUGE boon for casters, 20% on droppable gear,
effectively adding 20% to your mana pool unless you're casting CH, as
well as faster casting, longer range and duration, and more damage? And
this 20% is available on summoned or single groupable items. When you
get into raiding items, you also get solid stats on those items, AND a
higher %.

How about 20% stackable above-cap haste for all melees, or single items
with stackable 1500hp Aego?

That's the plan, however I forsee AVOIDANCE being the future of tanking,
rather than mitigation. The new AAs seem tailored to 'spreading the
load', leading to the theory that mobs will hit extremely hard.
hypothetical for now, but if the damage is spread out over several
people, levelling the spikes, surely the sensible option would be to
avoid as many 5k melee rounds as possible, rather than reducing them to
4k?

I agree the absolute difference will increase slightly in PoP, but I
question whether that'll happen enough to restore a real difference
between plate and leather. We'll have to wait and see on that count.

You forget that Knights have a 3rd balance - spells. Under the right
circumstances (eg: easy xp groups), SKs can do more damage than warriors
(spells and pet) as well as tank for longer (lifetaps healing back their
loss). Paladins can tank indefinitely (healing) and rip holes in Undead
(3k crits).

Agreed. A lot of a warrior's dps problems could be removed simply by
adding a 150dd proc to EB

I had no problems keeping agro versus a disciplined raid with
SoD/Primal/Jaelens. I still have problems keeping agro versus an
undisciplined raid with Hategiver/Bloodfrenzy. I don't think making EB
have an unresistable DD component would be overpowering in any way.

Here's what I posted on my guild messageboard, relating to *MY* view on
how the classes could relatively sit in terms of PURE melee. Hybrids
would have spells to add to their positions. Lemme know if you think
I've got a warped view on relative positions:

********************************************************

Warriors should be *required* to tank all raid level mobs. Period.
Damage should be enough to contribute (above sk/pal) without encroaching
on the non-tanking melees (rog/mnk/rng) 

SK/Pal should be able to adequately tank for an exp group, only
necessitating warriors in the toughest of camps. Pal slightly better at
tanking, SKs slightly better at damage. Both should gave additional
group/raid benefits in terms of scalable spells, and damage behind
warriors. 

Rangers should be next, but only able to tank on the easier exp camps.
They should have a burst of damage greater than any other melee, but in
regular melee only, they sit between monks and warriors. Utility spells
to group/raid such as snare, slow, pred etc. to lesser damage with pure
melee. 

Rogues should be able to take a few rounds of damage, but not tank. Just
behind rangers, since they are penalised by greatly reduced DPS while
tanking from the front to balance. A correctly positioned rogue should
be unsurpassed in pure melee damage. 

Monks should get (prolly through rightclicks - 3 sec cast of something)
some sort of rune effect which allows them to take a large initial burst
of damage, increasing their effective damage taking ability for a short
time. This wouldn't be chain castable or usable while tanking, but could
be used during pulls or to cushion ripostes. They should NOT, under any
circumstances, tank anything for any amount of time. To counter this
they excel in FD and pulling, have mend for a quick heal, and have melee
damage output second only to a well positioned rogue 

Bards should be able to use self-only songs to adjust their tanking
position to be slightly behind knights, OR their damage output to
slightly behind rangers. They would not stack, and if using songs to
increase their tanking, they lose a lot of dps, and vice-versa. They
should have a range of group/ae songs to benefit the raid. 

GENERAL DAMAGE RATIOS: 
Pal(1)...SK(1.2)....War(1.35).......Rng(1.5).............Mnk
(1.85).....Rog(2) 

Bards range from 1.25 to 1.6 depending on songs 
Rog drop to 1.8 on unpositioned mobs 
Rng have a boost to 2.5 or 3 on trueshot 

GENERAL TANKING RATIOS: 
Mnk(1)...Rog(1.1).......Rng(1.3)...............SK(1.7)....Pal(1.8)......
..War(2) 

Bards range from 1.25 to 1.6 depending on songs 
Monks rise to 1.9 or 2.2 for short non-stackable rune/disc 

Beastlords I don't really know enough about melee to comment. 

That's how I see the balance between the classes in an ideal world. Some
classes excel in a single area and get hit hard in others, whilst others
have a secondary role at the expense of specialisation in their primary
role
