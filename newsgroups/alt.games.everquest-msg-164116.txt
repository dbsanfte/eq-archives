It would be like a loom or an oven, only instead of Combine there would be 
Flush. Little piles of crap would appear in your inventory once per 2 eq 
days- they would be nonstackable and nondestroyable except by Flush. Once 
you get more than 2 you start to receive Encumbered-style movement 
penalties.

A 5 weight 4 slot portapotty would be available for 100 plat from vendors 
everywhere.

Monks could fling it. (Thats a nod to the Monkey Petition) The downside to 
this is that if you use it to pull it will be very hard to drop aggro.
