You can sell it for around 36p. For some reason Verant decided to throw in
twice as many gems that look EXACTLY like the gem you are really looking for
and name them ALMOST the same thing as the one you want. Basic rule,
Allakzahm's has ALL the velious armor quest gems listed, if it's not on that
list, sell it.
