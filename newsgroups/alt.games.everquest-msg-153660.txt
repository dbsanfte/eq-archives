Lately I have found that this KEI addiction has almost become worse then
EverQuest itself for whatever reason, leveling faster, handling adds easier,
etc.... I for one would like to see the level restrictions come back ( I
heard they where there and removed but I do not know from personal
experience).

I am wondering what other peoples views are of this and for you enchanters
out there, have you found the need for breeze and clarity gone down a lot?

Thanks
