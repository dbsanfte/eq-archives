Wrong.

Your practice points are basically worthless for combat skills.  Use
the ones at first level to learn 1 hand slash because that's what you
start with because that will give you a much needed head start at the
beginning, but after that you will only need to put one point into
each skill as it becomes available. Save the rest of the points,
because they are much more valuable when used for trade skills, or
some of the harder to learn skills that you get later in the game
(disarm - if you really want to bother with it)
