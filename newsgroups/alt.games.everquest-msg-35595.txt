Nope, you are SoL.  The braid quest is the only quest whcih raises OT
faction.  Illusions(other than racial illusions) will make you insta KoS
almost anywhere on Kunark.  So as an Iksar you start KoS to OT, and the only
creature who gives positive OT faction is..... Feydedar.   If you haven't
hunted in KC or HS or Kaesora(which ruins your faction even more), and
you're serious about raising OT faction, attend every since Fey raid you
see, and ask if they mind if you take a swing at Fey for the faction hit.
I've never attemped to raise faction this way, so I have no numbers as to
how many it would take to get non-kos, but I assume it's a lot.
