Not as long as you make it so damned easy by continuing to be a world
class-less jackass. 

How hard is it to comprehend? Do you have many friends in RL? If so, I
highly doubt you treat them as I've seen you treat many in the
newsgroup. I, for one, would knock the taste out of your mouth the
first time you talked to me like you have some of the others. 

And no, thats not a threat moron...its a statement regarding my
hypothetical reaction to your incredible lack of social skills if they
are same as you exhibit here.

Get a clue, man.
