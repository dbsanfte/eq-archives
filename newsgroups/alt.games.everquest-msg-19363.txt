There sure are a lot of different opinions about how to play a wizard
here.  That may be part of the problem that wizards have.  I suspect
it's mostly situational.

In a constant pull group I try to keep my wizard fairly close to 60
percent mana so I have plenty for emergencies.  I see myself as the
person who turns a bad situation around when there is an overpull.  The
goal here is maximizing kill rate while minimizing down time.  As long
as you're using mana at the same rate you regain it things are good.  

In a group that is single pulling and medding between kills I try to
match the mana usage of the rest of the group (while saving enough for a
few roots and an evac off course).  

It takes a while for a group to learn to work together, usually.
