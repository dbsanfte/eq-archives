I have had quite a lot of that with my Druid, I have even been
invited to join another lvl 1 character when I was about ten
minutes into the game.  Up to now I have found it better to solo
to get my level up and anyway with a Druid that puny level 1
Minor Healing would`nt be a lot of good anyway.
What I am wondering is at what level I would be useful in a group
as all the strategies and play guides tell me not to try to melee
in a group.
