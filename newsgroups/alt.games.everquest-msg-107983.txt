I thought I would throw this out there after seeing this in a thread
about Bards. We argue too much here.

On the road there used to be Burma Shave signs that had little rhymes,
that sold Burma Shave. I know there are Filk singers out there, lets
post a bunch of Barda Shave Signs.

Placed in WC:

If you like watching
Your own gore
Then travel at night
Through Kithicor
Barda Shave


In Freeport East:

If you hate hunting
with all the schmoes
then bypass Oasis
hunt Southern Ro!
Barda Shave

In the PoG:

If you want to try
Something cute,
Tell Prince Thirneg 
I like Phat Lewts!
