Long patch again, stillllllll loading it.  Looking at the files thus 
far, its all more spell casting graphics; I'd heard they'd forgotten 
half of the ones that they had on test, apparantly the rest are coming 
in today.

Another file, Path.ini.  I don't remember seeing that before, is it an 
old one?

Here's an interesting one, NIHFOG01.SPS.  Right in the middle of a ton 
of those spell effect files.  National Institue of Health?

Oh here's another odd one; smokead.dds.  They are putting smoking ads in 
EQ now?  Marlboro man on a drogmar?  Firiona Vie smokes Virgina Slims?

Spells_US.txt.  Spells are different in the US than in Europe?

Something called abysmal_obj.s3d, that I think I've seen many times 
before, is taking longer to load than all the previous files combined. 
Its definately abysmal.

See all the fun you guys miss with your T1 lines?  I get to read these 
file names for half an hour, you only get to see them fly by for 10 seconds!

OK all done.

What fun!
