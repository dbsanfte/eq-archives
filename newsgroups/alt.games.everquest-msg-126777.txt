Step 1: go to Lower Faydark. Find and kill Thistle Underbrush until he drops
the Pouch of Mistletoe Dust (one charge of a charm animals spell).

Step 2: go to EC. Use the Pouch to charm one of the various KOS cats that
wander the zone (Pumas in EC, yes?)

Step 3: cast your pet buff that raises level on the Puma. It will take, and
will make the little Puma into monster kitty.

Step 4: buff the hell out of monster kitty.

Step 5: shout "Puma to tunnel!" and run through the tunnel, zoning to NRo.
I'f you've given kitty SoW, the helpful and encumbered people in the tunnel
won't be able to catch you before you zone. When you zone, charm breaks and
kitty will walk back down the tunnel, much higher level, buffed to the
gills, and KOS to all.

    If you're a high-level kitty and can get Puppet Strings, we need a
question answered: when you level-buff a caster NPC, does that NPC gain the
ability to cast spells as a high-level caster? Having a level 60 BST create
a level 47 shaman orc in EC would be pretty interesting. ;-) It is also an
open question as to what happens when a high level mob has a low-end BST
level buff applied to it.
