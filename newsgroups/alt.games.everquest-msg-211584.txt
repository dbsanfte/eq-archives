hi

just for fun, i got an entwood mace (14/20, primary) and a WLK (16/22,
secondary) on a 55 monk with 22% haste and 160 str

and i was beating up some greens in OT, helping a friend level

and i checked my parser, and i only had........

40 dps.......

on average

for 45 minutes of fighting


WHY!?

55 monk with 30k in weapons doing the same dps as noobs? why?

what the *hell* is wrong with me?

everyone else has insane dps

most monks at 60 have around 70-90 dps

is it just that people level slowly and go raiding and have good guilds and
get great loot, so by the time their monks are 60, they are where they
should be, but i'm missing something?

and don't say triple atk, becaues 59 monks and 60 monks are only a teeny bit
different, all other things being equal

my monk is broken

~help~
