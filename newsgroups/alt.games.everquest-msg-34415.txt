It is the same: (level + 1) * 5. 

As a rogue, max your piercing first every level, then worry about
others. Eventually, the levels will take long enough to get through that
you'll have no problem keeping the others (1hs and 1hb - work on both)
maxed. Once you get dual wield, you can practice your other skills in
your offhand, as you will always want a piercing weapon in your primary
hand (for backstab).

That 'black pointy curved thing' is actually a pretty good weapon, much
better than a rusty *anything*, regardless of whether its a giant snake
fang or a drachnid tip (both use the same black pointy thing icon). I
knew a rogue who used a giant snake fang until he was level 20. Anyway,
if you are dead set on replacing it, get a fine steel rapier or spear;
should be about 5pp. Also, on Prexus anyway, Velium weapons only go for
around 10-12pp each. They are similar to fine steel, but are magical.

If it turns out you have a drachnid tip, hang on to it - it is magical,
which you'll need to hit creatures like wisps and ghouls later.
