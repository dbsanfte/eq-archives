My favorite message boars: 
http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm3

And my favorite FAQ can be found there by clicking on the FAQ link, or 
clicking below- and taking care of the wrap thing:

http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm3.showMessage?topicID=1694.topic

Either link you take will have a list of useful sites for those wanting 
to learn everything there is to know about the game.

Knowledge is the greatest power.
(Note: this does not mean you MUST max INT and WIS)
