I've read a lot of posts from beta testers. They claim that you can
get to level 50 without engaging in PvP. Getting into someone else's
realm is going to be next to impossible without a seriously
coordinated effort. You'll have to go to the 'frontier' areas to
engage in PvP. This sounds to me like EverQuest, with a large PvP
area, if you want to engage in it.

I think it only affects you if you are in the frontier area and
willingly engaging in PvP. It's sort of like Capture the Flag on a
much larger scale than in Quake or Half-Life. I don't think it affects
you when you are in your realm, but I'm not sure. I haven't heard beta
testers complain about power loss, so I assume this is the case.

This will not be a problem for quite a while. It takes a while for
huge guilds to be become established on a server, and I'm sure there
will be huge guilds in every realm to offset balance problems.

I haven't seen complaints about the game being boring, even after the
NDA was lifted. People are complaining about balance issues right now.
It doesn't seem much different than phase 4 of EverQuest's beta.
