Yes, I know.  And he used them with America's blessing.  An America
whose president at the time was a republican.

This kind of attitude sounds like a recipe for disaster.  Any American
president at any time can decide to announce his suspicion that
country X may have WMDs, or may be trying to obtain/produce WMDs, and
thus take any military action he desires, without any kind of
accountability whatsoever?

Well, you're a lucky man.  That's precisely how George W. Bush feels,
too, and he'll be re-elected in 2004, to the detriment of us all.

And that, perhaps, describes the single biggest issue with George W.
Bush: No accountability.  If he were any kind of honest and moral man
at all, he'd apologize to the people of the United States for making a
big mistake.  But he's so filled with pride he'd never do that.  His
pride is only equaled by his greed.

It goes without saying that you need to take anything said by any
media outlet with a grain of salt.  I agree with you here.

What reasons?  Because Bush wants Iraq's oil?  Because Bush likes to
kill obscene numbers of people in unjustified wars?  (It's funny how
our great Christian President, George W. Bush, can ignore "thou shalt
not kill" at his leisure.)

And if Iraq was such a justified war, why haven't we heard plans about
Sudan next?  They'd be a pushover militarily, and was a worse human
rights disaster than Iraq was, before Bush invaded and occupied the
country.

And what's the result if we continue to occupy Iraq?  Which, it's
obvious to most people, we will do.  Perhaps not with 200k troops, but
some rather permanent-looking military bases are being built there.

Do you know how arabs will react to military bases in Iraq?  Yes, you
guessed it, it'll aggravate huge numbers of arabs who will decide to
become terrorists as a result.

As I've stated before, Bush has made the world a much more dangerous
place for America, and it'll keep getting more dangerous until we get
that madman out of office.

> Clinton accomplished zero.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.

All right, this is provably false, so I'll just assume you're wrapped
yourself in such a tight blanket of anti-Clinton hate that you can't
talk about him with any kind of logic or sense.

Bush Jr. has done much worse than just defiling the presidency.

Here we go again with Reagan worship.

The USSR's economic system and corruption guaranteed it would fail
with or without the help of Ronald Reagan.  He's not responsible for
winning the cold war, and it's tiresome that people continue to
worship him as having achieved some great thing, when in fact at best
he just accelerated the inevitable.

That's an understatement.

The dumbing down of America.  Believe me, I'm not happy about it.
They'll choose flash (Bush) over substance (Kerry) in 2004, because
they don't know any better, or don't care to think too hard (Bush's
simpleton-like answers to every problem must be very appealing to
them).

Not when the decisions are the wrong ones, and Bush has very
consistenty made the wrong choices regarding foreign policy and
domestic policy.

Yes, I agree with you here.  Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Chris
Matthews, Bill O'Reilly, Fox News in general...  It's a common saying
that the media has a liberal bias, but I don't think that's true any
longer.  I think republicans have the far superior propaganda machine
these days.  Oh, and I forgot to mention the Christian church.  Yes,
republicans easily dominate the propaganda wars these days.

No, you didn't get a tax cut.  You were forced to borrow money.
Charging $300 on your credit card doesn't make you $300 wealthier.
Being forced to borrow money from foreign governments doesn't make you
wealthier either.

Social Security should be viewed as an investment.  (Okay, I don't
want to get too deep into this, because I agree that Social Security
needs to be reformed.  That a whole other subject though.)

I agree that it needs some kind of reform.  I haven't taken the time
to really understand it though, and what the right kind of fixes might
be.
