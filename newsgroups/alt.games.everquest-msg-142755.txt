I completely agree. I have a druid. We enjoy the ability to function
without the aid of a group for nearly the same rate of advancement
(maybe faster) all the way to 60. We can't have it both ways. Anyone
who doesn't like that shouldn't roll up a druid. The cake cannot be
had and eaten as well (don't even think about it, you know what I
mean).

Besides, who says druids don't have a roll on raids? Just because
nearly everything a druid does can be done a little better by another
class doesn't mean that a druid has nothing to offer. What, a
23-player raid is going to turn down a druid simply because they are
not the best at nuking or healing? Get real. Any added damage,
buffage, debuffage, healage (hehe), etc. is welcomed I'm certain.
