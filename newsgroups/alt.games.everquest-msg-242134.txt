The shaman, and the enchanter.  And probably any wizards or necros that 
happen to be around.  In an ideal world, true, slows would never be 
resisted, and always land at the earliest-possible not-aggro-getting 
moment, as opposed to the latest-possible aggro-getting moment.  But this 
world is far from ideal.  Similarly, some of those adds are gonna have to 
be tashed before mezz/root will stick.  Who do ya think's offtanking 
unslowed mobs til mezz finally sticks?

Also, you should expect DPS classes to take damage.  They are trying 
to do the most possible damage they can without getting aggro.  It's a 
fine line.  Sure, they could always just do less damage, but then the mob 
dies slower and the cleric's mana runs out faster anyway.  It's a tough 
balance.

The main tank should take as much damage as possible.  Everyone else 
should avoid taking a 'significant' share, if they can.  But expecting the 
tank to take -all- the damage every time is living in a dreamworld, and 
the cleric's gonna go OOM rezzing everyone.

Note:  I'm not talking about a raid, since the question is about groups.  
If the tank's trying to corner AoW, back the fuck off and hold your tash.
