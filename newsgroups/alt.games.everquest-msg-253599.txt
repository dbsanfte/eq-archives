we have a 65 epic'd berserker in guild, I dont know much about him except
that he has more hitpoints than I do.. im a beastlord with about 6600 hp and
he had around 7k raid buffed. neither one of us have progressed past tier3
yet, so no uber loots, although we are getting pretty close to kod we still
arent there yet either(heh... duh)


I dont really know a whole lot about him in terms of what his berserker can
do.. except that it tanked a raid mob about twice as long as my bst did
before falling. so apparently one or more of their disciplines avoids
damage/lessens damage/something and/or they tank better with no aa than
beastlords with all defensive aa's do, or that coulda been pure luck. I dont
know.

as far as soloing, I dont think they get a slow discipline, or a worthwhile
healing disc if any at all.
as far as grouping.. I'd invite one. they obviously have alot of hp cuz  a
freaking twink had more hp than my main did. and anything with hp can tank
trash mobs:)

Keep us updated on it, ive been thinking about making one too just to play
around with.
