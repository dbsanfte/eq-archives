Heh and reading thru here reminded me I also have a couple
chipped bone rods, and normally a couple cloudy potions.. only
I'm out of those.  Note to me: Buy more cloudy!

At any rate, everyone who can't locate corpse naturally should
carry a chipped rod in case they have to find a friends' body,
and have one in the bank in case they have to find their own
and can't find help.  As a cleric, naturally I'm faced with more
bodies than most, and some of them lost beyond finding (LD
while moving, or summoned by a mob that was moving, or
buried in a wall by one of verant's practical jokes)
