Seriously though, I'm not talking about someone who is purposefully
being an ass.  I'm talking about someone who made a mistake...maybe
during a pull or otherwise.  This person may be a terminally ill
player and some other jerk that's angry with their life is going to
jump down their throats just because all other players are to them is
letters on a screen.   That's a messed up way to exist in this game.  

Anyway, that's all I had to say.
