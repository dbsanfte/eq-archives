Ahh, that would have been SOOOO nice when i did blacksmithing, i still have
nightmares about metal bits.
Of course it didnt help that i didnt know you could use Shift and Control to
pick 1 or a stack at a time, so used the slider all the time (or you couldnt do
it at that time, cant remember), and it was also before you could buy a stack at
a time, so took forever to fill 6 10 slot backpacks with metal bits.
