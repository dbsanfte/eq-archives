I collected all the skulls solo, worked on the charcoal solo, didn't get the
drop, worked on it much faster with a group, and we got two in one evening.
The Priest, I did with just me and a 54 cleric, and my trusty pet.  The
Thought Leach Brain, I joined a low 40s group when I was lvl 49.  I offered
to just stand by the side and help taking no xp, in exchange for the looting
rights to the brain, but they invited me into the group, and we got one
after maybe 20 minutes.  I told them all about the quest, and they got
another brain for a druid in the group.  For the turn in fights, I did all
of those with one group of high 50s for my shield, with one group of low 50s
for a friends shield.  An enchanter is highly desirable for the first and
second turn in fights, as multiple mobs spawn.  The shield is absolutely
awesome, well worth the work.
