You end up in a situation where neither aura remains up.  Each time you 
move away and back in range of each other, one or the other cancels out 
and then the buff never gets refreshed.  Can't remember the full detail 
but basically when I group with other toons of the same class we now 
just agree who's going to run their aura.
