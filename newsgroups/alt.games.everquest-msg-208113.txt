Let me help you with the contrast:

"Need" - to be necessary

So you see, you're gonna have to ease up on the semantics, particularly
concerning a word you originally used, for any definition of "need" or
"greed" to apply to a *game*.  :P

If it makes you feel better, call it "Desire before Want".  If you find that
ironic...  good.
