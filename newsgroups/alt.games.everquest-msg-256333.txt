    Barely. The rats are in the low 40's, as are the guards. The prisoners
near zone out are 45, except Sralm Noramir the level 49 Iksar monk. Sralm
will add on pulls near him when he's up, as will the Royal Guardian (high
elf), the rats, and the guards.Everything else is single. Usually a puller
would be wise to try and get Sralm single, then pull as many rats/guards as
they can see, and finally start pulling prisoners in a counter-clockwise
order from Sralm's room (so the barbarian woman next, then the centaur,
etc.) When my monk did that the number of adds dropped significantly. In
addition, as you level up you'll find you can pull mobs past dark blue rats
and guards and sometimes not get adds.

    Remember that if the puller isn't pulling from further back than the
first loop of mobs, nothing will be base KOS to you. So when pulls come in,
if dying is an issue stand back and watch for adds before joining the fight.

    As long as the ranger or yourself snares, there's no issue with adds
when you pull close to the zoneout. Well, one possible issue - some of the
casters do Gate. But you have the ability to stop that. Captain is a good
camp for XP, but it has two issues. One, the mobs you kill there are
factioned, and you will eventually go KOS with a number of the prisoners in
Justice by killing there. Two, there's a fair number of KOS mobs in the
rooms near the Captain room, so you won't be as safe with pulls and
exploration could get you killed.

    Gaolers are level 50. They're about the wimpiest level 50 mob you'll
ever encounter. When I melee solo them with my cleric, as long as I bring a
damage shield potion I need one Supernal Remedy to heal after killing them.
No other heals.

    Justice seems to be the easiest to do, at least from what I've seen.
Innovation has mobs near zone-in that are much higher level, and thus harder
to hit.
