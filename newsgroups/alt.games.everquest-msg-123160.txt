So normally I leave the "bard songs" in options set to off, cause
I'm not interested in the massive amounts of spam I generate
on a constant basis.  Yeah yeah, my wounds heal I feel strong
blah blah blah... when its a new song hitting every 6 seconds
its just tooooo much.

But I was playing around stacking Soothing and Manasong
together (should be almost half again the mana replentishment
that straight manasong is) and needed the message to time
when to stop pulse and redo soothing (its soothing clears
clears soothing, by the way)

Then I went in and pulled out another charm pair... surprise
with bard songs set to all I get a message when charm sticks!
So much for the Rythm method
