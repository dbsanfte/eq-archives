If you *read* my post you can see what I'm complaining about. Yes I know
that Mana Burn is being changed this coming week, but Mana Burn does not
allow a Wizard to solo all day long without downtime, which was my point
apart from the Familiar illusion topic as well .. I don't have Mana Burn
anyway, I place my skills into spell casting fury, that's a far more useful
skill for me to have as a soloing Wizard than Mana Burn.
