Seems to me they could fix the backlog problem just by having him spawn more
often,or maybe have him spawn randomly in several zones... or maybe even
spawn in a random zone? Guilded druids would have their work cut out for
them if this happened. It might have to be a different looking mob in
different zones, due to the limitations of the eq engine, but thats
irrelevant if hes funtionally the same.
