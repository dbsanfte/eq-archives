    Note that what "24 points" means is that you'll have to earn the XP to
go from 51 to 52 *TWENTY-FOUR TIMES* to have enough points to get this
ability. The number is quite similar for the ability I was planning to get,
the 100% XP res. But after seeing that you had to get a cruddy arch level
skill to get the XP res, and after seeing the refresh on it was
approximately *60 EQ days*, or three days /played, I might give it a pass.

    Takes a real ENCH to time the stun before mezzing, too. As a cleric if I
see a pet causing problems, I usually find one well-timed stun will take
care of things nicely.
