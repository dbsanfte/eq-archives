You live in a bad state...in California, if a company fires you, they have
24 hours to put your paycheck in your hand or they face serious legal
repercussions.

When you quit, that time gets expanded to whenever your normal check would
arrive.

Not to steal a line from P&H, but a phone call to the BBB or the chamber of
commerce, an appropriate union, or whatever state agency regulates such
things would be in order. On the other hand, the longer it goes, I believe
you become entitled to a larger and larger check...so maybe hold off :)
