I played EQ1 since '01 and tried EQ2 this spring. I didnt get really
far but it looked cool. Then a friend of mine asked me to join their
guild in WoW and been playing that for a couple months now and I
wanted to get others take on the future of these games and whether
Sony learned their lesson from people or not. IMO EQ was punishing for
people. Death xp loss, quest reward vs. difficulty, no ability to solo
past a young level for most classes (just telling people to play druid
or necromancer limits the game somewhat). I have read that WoW is
today has the largest volume of subscribers and a LOT of people I meet
in the game are EQ players who love it. 

should grouping be REQUIRED to play a game like this? in EQ1 you
couldnt do jack without a group. In WoW you can solo easily all the
way to 60  but it isnt nearly as good xp as instances and the grind is
boring and the loot isnt as good. You arent being punished but
encouraged.

should Death XP loss occur? In EQ they even punished you further
during certain levels by giving additional loss which i hated. It did
however make you more cautious a player. In WoW you get item damage
from death which can get costly to repair....is this a good tradeoff?

EQ has many more classes and races, more continents, planes etc....the
content of EQ was rich.......the graphics and game environment of WoW
however is rich. EQ2 is pretty good in that regard but i never got
past 12th so I wouldnt have seen much content there.

So whats your take on things? Could Sony learn from other games to
make EQ better and not lose the customer base or is it fine the way it
is? Could Blizzard learn from EQ and toughen up WoW a bit??
