But of course asshole posts complaining, bitching and moaning about other
assholes complaining, bitching are the height of intellectual witticism Dan.
I think this odd feeling in the pit of my stomache is shame welling up over
your marvelous and insightful put down....

                .....oh ....sorry, it was just wind.

Anyway - I did not think I was trying to mask my sarcastic and pessimistic
demeanour at all. The only thing that confuses me is your inference that
there is something amiss by this? I got so puzzled I even re-read the system
requirements on the EQ box, but I still couldn't find the bit you seem to be
referring to:

"Windows 98/200/Me/XP.
 Pentium II 400+.
256MB+ ram.
Direct3D compliant video card.
Positve Attitude to keep Dan off the Prozac.
28.8K + internet connection.
Valid Credit Card."

Sorry - my packaging must be damaged somehow...Mmmkay?
