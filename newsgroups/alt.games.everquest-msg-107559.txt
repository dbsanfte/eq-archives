Dennis,

This toon is for my enjoyment, to try things out with, and (as you are a
philosopher you'll understand this) *create my own reality*.  I'm leery of
people just discounting abilities past certain "caps," arbitrarily assigning
haste values to items, and pretending as if they had the source code to EQ
sitting right in front of them so they know every formula and nuance.

It is just like a computer science major (but quite unlike a philosopher) to
read the question (my original and updated post) and answer what he _thinks_
is my question.  So, let me lay it out plain, using sentential logic (you've
had logic, right philosophy major?)

A: You know some quests that will increase my stats, primarily dex/str/agi.

B: Please share them with me.

A just in case B.

Thanks, Francis.

Bryce
