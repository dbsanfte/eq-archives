i believe that the sk i a really gud class to solo with they have dots fear
reverse kiteing and have a pet to help with the casters add to that that
they can use plate armor and have most of the abilities of a warior and you
pretty much set by the way troll is an excellent choice they have high
strenth and superfsat hp regeneration and good vision and  have the slam
ability so you dont have to use a shield to bash and u can see why they make
a gud choice fer a solo charecter:)
