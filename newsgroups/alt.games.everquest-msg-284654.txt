Ah, oops, my error; I fumbled the factor of ten on /pause.  (/blush)

It only ties up macros, i.e. socials.  Hotkeys that are direct copies
of abilities or spells or items still work, I believe.  But losing my
socials is a much bigger deal for me.  Maybe it's because I'm a
programmer by trade, but I tend to use socials a lot more.  For
example, even my "feign death" hotkey is not just a copy of the
ability key; it's a social that does /attack off, /doability FD, /loc.
And my "Mend" hotkey (heal self 25%) is a social that includes /time
so I'll know when it's going to reset.

Sure, in a pinch I can click on the ability keys directly, but in that
same pinch I'm likely to need the abilities suddenly, and my reflexes
are to type the number keys instead of sending the mouse to the ability
window.  (I do keep the ability window visible, but not so much as a
way to invoke the abilities; rather it's so I can see when the abilities
have reset, since the social hotkeys don't show me that.)

Still, that factor of 10 is enough to convince me that a BW5 macro could
have a place in my repertoire.  (Or maybe a BW4 that concludes with a
/vplay to let me know when it's time to hit it again.)
