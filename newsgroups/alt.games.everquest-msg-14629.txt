I'm playing a Rogue, and I although grouping is more effective XP-wise I
still like to play solo at times. I've found that the monsters I've got to
fight to get xp gets tougher and tougher relative to me as I level, and I'm
currently having problems soloing blues. Time to look into poison to get an
extra edge, I thought.  In my experience though, poison seems a total waste
of time and money at my level (27).
    If I buy all the ingredients for the easiest poisons it will cost me 5gp
for the suspensionfluid, 18gp for the vial and 10gp for 2 snake poison sacs.
If I make the vials myself and spend 30 mins killing snakes for the snake
sacs, I will have expenses of about 1pp on each kill + 30mins running
around. Neither of these options are very appealing to me.
   What I think should be done is to increase the drop-rate of poison
ingredients, and also let us keep the empty vials after applying the
poison, or at least let the poison be useable for more than one attack.

I'd like to hear other rogues experiences with poison, and if it becomes
more useful at higher levels.
