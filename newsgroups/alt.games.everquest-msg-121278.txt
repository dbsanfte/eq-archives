If the presense or absence of a particular class can make or break a
raid, then that class is too heavily relied upon and thus too
powerful. There is a line between a class simply being "useful" in a
group/raid/guild and them being REQUIRED.

People too often, though, don't see it as the class being too strong,
but as others being too weak, which is why boosts in those other
classes are better received than actually balancing the one. There was
some article written once about how "continual nerfing" kills MUDs. My
view is that continually boosting the things that lag behind those
that are overpowered out of fear of "nerfing" can kill a MUD even
faster. Same would apply to a MMOG...
