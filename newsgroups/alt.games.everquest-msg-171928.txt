    Are you two talking about the same mob? This is Allakhazam's entry for
the Restless Burrower:

    http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8716

    No gloves listed, and the loots are indeed as jaw-dropping as claimed
for the difficulty. That talisman is mind-numbingly out of place on that mob
(one of our shamans has one).
