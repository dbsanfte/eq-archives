I got the spell from a friend after showing him the value of hunting
ulthork man o wars even at level 53. I've seen tumultuous str drop
from the same ulthorks and also from rygorr orcs.

It's a very nice spell, but you can live happily without it and I
wouldn't pay more than 200 for it.

I don't know how it stacks with other debuffs; it lowers fire by 30
and AC by an unknown amount and I have yet to hear of any stacking
conflicts. I'll cast it in most groups I am in nowadays, both for the
lowered AC, and in case I feel like throwing a nuke at the mob - the
main edge of this spell is that fire based nukes are no longer a
mostly resisted waste of time :)
If you can hunt without using fire nukes, you don't need the spell,
but it's nice if you DO have it.
