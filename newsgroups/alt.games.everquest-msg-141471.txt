Everquest.

Possibly a new computer too.  Almost certainly lots of upgrades.

To start with, at the very minimum, you have to buy the original Everquest,
if it's still available that way.  I would just go with the Trilogy, that
has the original, plus the first two expansions.  There is currently one
more expansion, Shadows of Luclin, available, it places more requirements on
the minimum necessary system.
