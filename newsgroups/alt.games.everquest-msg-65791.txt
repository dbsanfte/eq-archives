Have you looked at yourself without the new textures since the change?
I've seen a report from someone that changing his Luclin look changed
his old face... 
Hence, if I talk my 196 mb ram into accepting ONE face for a while, I
am going to spend quality time with my mule and see what options I can
switch around without changing her old face. I want to make my
characters as pretty as possible to the Luclinites without ruining
their old faces... and it's scary, but as a wood elf druid, I am
envying the humans (I want a braid too!) to the point that one of my
otherserverly alts will be reincarnated as a human druid. 

I find myself intrigued by the textures almost against my will,
especially considering how ugly I think plate and leather textures
are. The chain textures generally rock, and I've decided I should
aspire to get chain tunic and (especially) leggings. Heck, they look
more interesting even in old graphics.

Right now I am also still laughing at the message board threads I just
saw about the nude character bug.

for instance.


Can't get other how ugly leather leggings are
