After reaching lvl 18 as a predator I decided it was time to get my crafting 
level up. I am now level 11 after choosing a crafstmen as my initial 
profession.

I still find crafting to be very complicated though, especially as the only 
info available is through forums and most of this is based for high level 
crafters.

So with that in mind here's what I need help on:

1. Am I right in thinking that when I level up as a craftsmen that all the 
crafting skills for my profession automatically go up to max? For example I 
just checked my skills and craftsman is at 62/62, where as tailoring is 
36/46.

2. What is the best way to increase the skills not related to my profession. 
For example I have tailoring at 36/46, how can I move that onto 46. Also is 
this the maximum it will ever be as this is not a part of my profession 
skills?

3. I took a society order for 10 leather bangoliers (or something like 
that), this has nothing to do with my profession. Why is my society giving 
me orders that are stupidly difficult to make. After around 5hrs getting all 
the components together I only managed to make 5 out of 10. My skill in 
tailoring is so low that it's very difficult and most times I fail.

How am I supposed to complete this task when I dont have character to do so? 
If I level upto lvl 40 as a craftsmen I still wont be able to do this as my 
tailoring skill will still be at 36.

4. I'm worried now as if I want to lvl up my guy then it looks like I wont 
be able to. I can create items using my craftsmen skill but how do I create 
the components not related to craftsmen? Am I supposed to buy them all?
