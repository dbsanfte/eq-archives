> The formula for up to 200 is Level*(INT/5 + 2).  So, 173 total INT gives
878
Check again on that formula.  LV*(INT/5+2) is actually the same as
LV*(INT/7) (the "5+2" is under the "/").  Here is the formulas I was able to
come up with, that appear to work (based on that mana calc.

IF INT <= 200 THEN
Mana = (LV*2) + (LV*INT/5)

IF INT > 200 THEN
Mana = (LV*42) + ((INT-200)*5.8)

Not done specialization yet.  Not fully figured out which area would be most
bennificial (Dark Elf Necro).
