Every tactical as well as strategic skill
can be improved throughout the level...even if the level were to take forever
(level 60, for example).  The day you stop trying to learn to get better is
when it stops being a game and starts being a glorified chat room / graphics
world to explore.  Not to say that those activities aren't fun too, but they're
not really a game as such, more of a passtime.

Games, in my mind, require strategy, tactics, and technique.
