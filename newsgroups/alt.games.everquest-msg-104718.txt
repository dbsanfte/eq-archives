Beware the usual Pricewatch trickery.  Make sure that the price they
advertise is what you're really getting, watch out for huge shipping
charges that negate any "discount", and beware of retailers that either
carry really crappy bottom-feeder items (really cheaply, of course) or
never actually ship some portion of their orders, making up for the
discount on the ones they do.  There are some really crappy stores on 
Pricewatch.

Incidentally, two that I've had really good experience with are TCWO
(Thompson's Computer Warehouse Online, www.tcwo.com) and NewEgg
(www.newegg.com).  You should also check www.outpost.com, who often has
prices as low or lower than anyone on Pricewatch, and has excellent
customer service to boot.
