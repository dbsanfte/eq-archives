  I think he means that in 2002, there's no reason for something like EQ's
boat system to be any game that cares to call itself modern from a design
standpoint.  And face it, the game is anything but modern... just look at
the UI.  They have been able to retrofit some aspects of the game, and have
made some progressive design changes, but the fact remains that the game was
created 3+ years ago, and the core of the game is rather primitive compared
to what players have come to expect from a game today.

  Not realism, game designers typically seek to make their game realistic
unless they're making a sim.  Immersiveness is what they look to add.  The
boats themselves are anything but realistic and in my opinion, they don't
add a lot to the immersiveness either.  In a fantasy genre game, I find a
boat with no visible signs of a rudder, crew, steering wheel or magical
devices to substitute for these things to be a lot more interupting of my
suspension of disbelief than teleport spells and things like Nexus spires.
When I wait on a boat or ride a boat, it doesn't conjure up images of
adventurous journies and magical realms in my mind... it conjures up worries
of whether or not I'm going to JUST miss the boat and have to wait 20
minutes to join my friends to play the part of the game I enjoy.  It
conjures up worries that I'm going to go LD on the boat and find myself
inexplicably dumped in the middle of some ocean I'm not really familiar
with.  I worry that something will go buggy and I'll get shoved off the
boat, or will die on it, and will have to wait an hour to get my petition
answered so I can continue playing the game.  With all these worries its
hard to sit back, relax and allow myself to become "immersed" in the game,
especially since riding the boats is something I've already experienced many
times in the past, and barring bugs and LDs, the journey is always the same,
always boring.

  Fine idea, but I bet it wouldn't be all that simple to implement.  It
would just create one more thing to go wrong with the boats.

  Which is probably why he said a "travel like the EQ boat system".  Nobody
says there can't be boats, but 30 minutes of waiting on/raiding on static,
boring boats where you can't do anything, and where bugs and LD can cause
major inconvenience and delay?  There's no place for that sort of thing in a
game these days.  In EQ, good examples of modes of travel would be the
Nexus, teleport spells, and horses.  A bad example would be the boat system
in its present form.

  Sailing would be a fine skill to add, but is the investment in resources
it would take to implement such a thing really worth it when the primary
complaints people have could be wiped away with a couple simple
modifications to the current boats, or an extension of the Nexus portals?

  Downtime is fine, but they've really overdone it with the boats.  I find
plenty of oppurtunity to socalize when running, waiting on teleports,
running errands in town and even when I'm fighting or preparing for a fight.
The fact that bards have more difficulty chatting during downtime may be a
class problem that you should try to get Verant to address.  Maybe they can
add in some mechanism to make twisting a less antisocial and less medically
dangerous (considering carpal tunnel syndrome) activity.
