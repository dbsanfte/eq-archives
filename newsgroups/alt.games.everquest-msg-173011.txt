Guides have any use?  I'd be suprised.  No point rating them when they
are all a big fat 0.  All I've ever seem them do is show up tell people
to knock off being assholes and threaten to get a GM.  Not to mention
they are volunteers and for the most part have a high overturn rate.  If
the poll was more than a month old it would be totally out of date.
