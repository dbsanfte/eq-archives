I'd second Paludal.  And, furthermore, if you can't get a group there, 
solo.  I have soloed My druid there from 14 to 23, my enchanter there from 
12 to 23, and my ranger from 13 to 15, as well as a wizard on test server 
from 8 to 10.  I have eaten several deaths with each of them, it usually 
takes one or two kills to regain the lost xp.  You would have to actively 
be trying not to level in order to not hit 23 within a period of hours.  My 
wizard on test is practically naked, totally untwinked, he has 3 peices of 
newbie caster quested armor, cloth in a few slots, and nothing in other 
slots, so, it does not take twinking to be able to solo there.  It really 
is trivial.
