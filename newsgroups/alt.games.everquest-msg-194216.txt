Depends on the law.  Even with laws written in such a way ad to disallow
judges using their own 'judgment', there are higher courts that can be
appealed to if the law is in any way unconstitutional.  That is called
balance of power.  Also, before a law is even considered by the court it has
to be brought before the court by either the police or by way of lawsuit.
The police generally do what they feel is best regardless of the stupid law
de jour.

As to the topic at hand.  I think the law does not say that firewalls are
illegal, nor is that it's intent.  This is just someone that is stirring
things up because the law is (supposedly) written broadly enough that
someone could interpret it as covering firewalls.  But things really don't
work like that.  For firewalls to be in danger a lawyer would have to bring
lawsuit against a firewall mfg charging them to stop making firewalls.  At
that point a court would decide that that is not what the legislature
intended with their poorly written law.  Courts make that specific decision
all the time.
