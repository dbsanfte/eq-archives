OK... calming down and re-reading the answer...



Ok... I **still** don't understand why people whose language is NOT english
or who can't even understand or write in English, should post to a
*primarily* English  speaking group. I'm NOT saying they're wrong, I only
want to understand *why* they do this? If ***I*** spoke a language that many
of the peoples of the worlds couldn't understand, then I -seriously- doubt
that I would be posting to a NG which didn't cater to that language (or to
something similar). I'm sorry if I blasted him/her, but I posed a question
many many days ago that NO one has been able to answer, though I did get a
lot of flames (and that's ok, it's what the internet is all about) about it.
I am very sorry if the question was posed in a bad or confusing manner. I
know that, sometimes late at night, I get abrupt and am not always as easy
going as at other times. Mea culpa.

However, NO ONE has been able to answer my question to my satisfaction.
(Actually, that isn't true... one other posed and I answered, and it *was*
truth)... I'm sorry if that offends people in this NG, but it's the truth,
so far as I see it... I've gotten a lot of  responses that pretty much said
I'm a Nazi (I'm not), and that I can't tolerate another person's language or
differences (which isn't true). But I'm sorry, that just isn't the case. I
"tolerate", if you want to call it that, a LOT of things, and I love all
things alien to me. Alien things, whether of language or philosophy or
culture or religion do not scare me. I wish only to learn. I do NOT hold a
person's lineage/heritage/language against them. I -love- peoples of all
nations. (much as some of you might have a hard time believeing). I only
wanted to know -why- someone of a non-english speaking language would post
here when there were virtually no odds of them being answered.

Is that really such a stupid question?

Personally, I don't think so. Apparently, for many of you... yes. Sorry for
wanting more than an inch of earth in which to dig.

I give up. I will *never* again answer posts to this thread, whether it be
you, Celaeno Duskwalker, or Bizbee (I know, you've not said a word) or DT or
Lokari or *anyone* else. I'm sick of the whole thing.

I declare it dead.

And *I* don't think this person gave me an answer of ANY kind, much less a
good one... and I certainly haven't thrown a tantrum in many many years. Do
you even recognize what that might be??
