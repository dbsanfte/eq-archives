That depends on the levels of your characters. Up until 20, it's
pretty much everybody tanking with a little bit of healing and buffing
from classes that can do that.

Post 50, it's:

Cleric - Heal Damage, Buff, Rez
Enchanter - Crowd Control, Buff
Warrior / Shadowknight - Take Damage
Druid / Wizard - Evac and ( Snare / Do Damage)
Everyone Else - Fight for group spaces.

Verant could immediately improve the lot of 2/3 of the classes in
Post-50 play by increasing the number of slots in a group from 6 to 8,
thereby doubling the number of grouping opportunities.
