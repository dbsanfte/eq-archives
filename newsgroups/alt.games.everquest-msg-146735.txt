Kurns Tower... kill Loot... save the bone chips, not necessairly for
you, but to sell to higher level players working on cabilis faction.

its about he most you can do at your level... you could go to paineel
and hunt there, some bronze that sells for a few plat drops there, but
your first stage will just be working on faction to be able to sell in
paineel.

Luck to you.
