You've had some excellent suggestions already but I'm surprised nobody
has recommended R.A. Salvatores' books.

The Dark Elf Trilogy.
The Icewind Dale Trilogy.
The Legacy of the Drow Trilogy.

Are the ones to start with ).

Especially good if you're a RPG fan familiar with the Forgotten Realms
setting, or a fan of the Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale games from Black
Isle Studios. 

IMHO they are also all a great read for EQ fans.

If you like these chances are you will like the other Forgotten Realms
novels also like the Elminster series etc.
