It was database size licensing costs that they gave as one of the reasons
for only allowing one character per account on a server.  They didn't say
it was Oracle they were using--that's just a rumor as far as I know...I
haven't seen an actual post to a forum or statement from anyone at SOE
saying it is Oracle.

I don't see any licenses listed at Oracle that would depend on database
size, but I do recall that a long time ago, some major commercial databases
were licensed that way, so would not rule out that there could have been an
Oracle license like that at one time.  SOE has been working on SWG for a
long time, so could be using something licensed under some very old terms.

As far as getting what you pay for--there are bargains out there. :-)  DAoC
is using MySQL on Linux.  They seem to be getting a lot more than they paid
for!  (And they have named Oracle as the database they initially planned to
use...and then found out the license they needed was going to be $900k,
which was waaaay too expensive for them (DAoC had a total development and
deployement cost of $2.5 million, so $900k would have been painful to them))
