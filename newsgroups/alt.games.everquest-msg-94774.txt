n40 eh... well I read up on it and the n50... I like the many features
of the 50 but it does not appear to get my hands in any new postion...

so the N40 has a different physical feel.   How are the hot key
functions?  any issues to be aware of...

Im an old FPS player... so I play with keyboard in my lap with a
variation on the WASD keyboard setup.  with mous look used alot.

does the game pad eliminate the use of the mouse? (of cours not
entirely but mostly?)  i.e. do you control the mouse pointer with the
game pad or are you still using the mouse for mouse functions?

your time is appreciated... and my hands thank you for your
information.
