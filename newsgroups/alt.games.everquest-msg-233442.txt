Tossup for me on the dark elves.  Some ways they're better, some ways worse.
One of the worst things was the change in appearance of the Ry'Gorr armour.
The old appearance of it (the flame pattern) was fabulous.

Agreed on using the Ykeshan trolls.

Sure they were funny-looking but they were also definitely non-human.  I
still use old ogre models.

Definite agreement.

Partly yes, partly no.  I'd really have preferred they do this:

Earth elemental - use the ogre model scaled down, covered with whatever the
standard "ground" texture is for the zone.
Fire elemental - use the wolf form but use a transparent fire texture over
it.
Air elemental - use the existing headless floater was my original idea.
Now, I'd say use the whirlwinds from LDoN.
Water elemental - use the ooze shape (tars, flesh blobs, things like that)
with a transparent water texture.
