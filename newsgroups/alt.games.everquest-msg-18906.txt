Well, Najena is lvl 28 or so. I saw a lvl 31 mage camp her once solo. But
she just wanted the Flowing Black Robe which is a common or uncommon. The
book is a rare drop from her.
Considering you need to be lvl 30+ to really get it and there are only like
3 or 4 mobs withing exp range then it gets really tedious to camp there.

And you got a shield as well? Ouch. I thought I was generous when I twinked
a random lvl 6 paladin with almost full BI armor from Runnyeye and gave her
several velium weapons to boot.
