  Show me somewhere I can get a legal copy of Windows 98 (or Me) with media
included, please?  I can't find anybody selling near that price advertising
on pricewatch.com or eBay.  Do you mean B&M places, yard sales, or what..?
Curious, because I certainly would like to upgrade this machine to Windows
98 if I can do so at a minimum expense.  I will be passing it along to a
family member soon, but I'd like to play EQ in the meanwhile and give them a
more up to date OS, but not at a price of $80+, plus the whole hassle of
upgrading.

  Thanks.
