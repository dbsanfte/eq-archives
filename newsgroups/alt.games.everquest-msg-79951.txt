Have you noticed that sometimes when a character is next to a wall, at the
edge of a dock or on a slope that they appear to be jumping up and down?
Same thing when someone is at the edge of a body of water...they appear to
be swimming.  Perhaps that has something to do with it?  The only time I get
the interrupt message is when I'm running, try to stop and cast.  Turning,
after stopping, then casting usually fixes this.
