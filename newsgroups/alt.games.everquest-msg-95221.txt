>>>snip story<<<

I actually have a good story. I was killing mechanics in Ak'Anon (what, I
can't kill my own kind?) when I get a tell from a newbie necro. I have a
soft spot for necros, so I tell him if he can find me, I'll give him some
coin. For anyone who's been in Ak'Anon, I was next to the cart about halfway
through the zone, not hidden but can be difficult to find. After a few more
hints, he finally found me and I gave him 3pp.

The next day, I was in WC watching a monk kill a HG. I was going to kill it
myself, but my sister kept yelling at me that I couldn't take it. Right, and
this monk two levels below me is soloing it. Anyway, (back on subject now)
after killing the HG, the monk comes up to me and gives me a FS sword, HG
toes, lambent stone, and some change.

I figured that she was just giving them to me to keep her under weight. Then
she said "That's for my friend. You gave him 3pp for his spells while you
were killing mechanics."

Not much in the way of loot, but the thought was there. So not every beggar
story is bad.

Just most of them.
