> Get your LoY spell Stoicism,

Got it last night! Was surprisingly easy. Invis'd into Dulak, parked behind
the houses. Found a few drunks, Slow-pulled them both without adds and the
2nd one dropped the Flask. Flotsam and Jetsam were only mildly tougher, but
easily dispatched.

It was very productive night, I also managed to complete my Canni II quest
(all I needed was the Shaman Powder, I'd gathered everything else before
leaving the game previously). The first Yun Shaman dropped the Powder and I
was in business. It took me longer to find the npc giving the quest lol.

I have no experience yet with Topor but Stocism ROCKS! Particularly in
conjunction with my Canni II. Two days, and I feel like I'm really back in
this world again ...
