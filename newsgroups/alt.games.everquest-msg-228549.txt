Really?  I was unaware of that.  Played an enchanter too.  Why don't I 
see  enchanters using pet canni then?  Are their pets too expensive to 
cast relative to their HP at all points?

Still annoying that its a level one spell for mages, who can't even 
dream of using it till level 4.  Worse game design in my opinion than 
the Tiny Companion thing, because by level 19 you are already probably 
hooked anyway, while its entirely possible that a real newbie decides to 
start a mage and finds out that there are utterly useless spells to buy, 
making him question the entire system.

Hmm, not sure thats a bad thing.  Think twice, little newbie, do you 
-really- want to marry someone who can't seperate whites from colors... 
pink laundry for life!
