This was the piece I had the hardest time with.  You need both invis and 
invis to undead for this part.  If you know Kaesora it's easy, if you're a 
feign class it's easy.  If you're a gating class it's not too tough.  If 
you're a melee or hybrid, it's a bitch.  Nothing worse than working your 
way down and finding that someone already got the piece.  It's an 8-hour 
spawn time, and if more than one guild is working on VP keys, you may be 
there for a day or two.

Bards can charm the iksar too.  The staff is pretty common in Chardok and 
droppable.

> SoNH: ground spawn, easy

Yep, but get the location exactly right.  It's very hard to see if you 
don't know where to look.  Overhead view helps, but that damn tree in the 
way sometimes hides the piece.  It looks like a bag on the ground.

I killed this one several times before I knew about the VP key quest.  He 
was blue, I was crossing FV, easy exp on my way to or from Seb.  Still not 
sure if he's a true 8-hour spawn or if he just has PHers.  He's the only 
undead in the zone, so anyone with sense undead is at least as useful as a 
tracker.


> LOIM: bloodgill marauder, easy
> - not often up

Was up the first time I went looking for him.  Lots of soloers kill the 
bloodgills, and this guy gives some of them trouble.  If someone is 
camping for exp, you can ask if they'll let you help and loot on the 
bloodgill marauder kill.

> DL: rotting skeleton, easy > - static spawn, 8 min spawn, iirc

Yeah, though he's killed a couple high level tank types.

Actually, schedule a run and have a bunch of people do this all at the 
same time.  Don't try to invis down, live, undead, and see-invis mobs all 
in close proximity.  If you have good faction you can walk it, but most 
prefer to kill the whole way down.

The Pained Soul himself is fairly hard, and if you want to kite him beware 
of adds.  Lots of undead around the area, hard to see in the fog.  If you 
hunt Seb regularly, just stop by every time you enter or leave Seb.  If 
he's not up, kill PHer, wait for one cycle, head out.  I finally just sat 
down and camped it one day, 3 hours got one for me and 1 for my guildie 
camping with me.

This is the only piece that is consistantly good exp.  Soloers can 
generally do pretty well here, but it takes them a while to clear enough 
room to kill Verix without adds, and it's a bit dangerous if you don't 
have any help.  A full group of 60s is a bit overpowering, but almost 
everything you can pull from the basement is either blue or cyan.  We've 
always taken a guild-group down there and just killed everything we could 
get out hands on.  One late night we were pulling basement all the way to 
Warlord room.  If you turn off OOC & shout, it can be a really fun place 
to camp.

If your guild has trouble killing Trak, you probably shouldn't be in VP.  
Generally by the time you have critical mass on VP keys, Trak is your 
bitch, if not, get ready to die.  Alot.  And then die again.  

> Good luck! Btw the medallions and tooth can be MQed.

OK, now speaking of VP, there have been several mentions of Veeshan's Peak 
being upgraded.  I heard that the new VP is live on Test, but I haven't 
seen any confirmation of this.  Can anyone here verify this, and if so, 
what is different about it now?  As it it, I already have my Feverbane, 
and other than Grey Suede Boots, there isn't much more that I want from 
VP, but I love that zone for some strange reason.  Risk v. reward is 
pretty crappy, the yard trash is at least as hard as ToV stuff, with no 
drops, and the pathing is fubar, but killing dragons makes it fun.
