The only real major weak link. Yes, GEForce is what you want (imo) but
anything that starts with MX is a very weak sister and pays a huge
performance penalty vs non MX cards. Basically, most MX GF4s perform like
GF2's used to. The best upgrade you could get, that will give you the most
bang for buck is probably an upgraded video card (since these have such a
huge impact on in-game performance). My suggestion is a GeForce 4 ti4600, a
very nice performer which you ought to be able to pick up fairly cheap these
days (dunno, less than $100?). If Santa is a in a really generous mood, ask
for a Geforce FX Ultra 5900 (that's what I use), but expect to pay more like
400-500 or so, not sure what they go for these days, I bought mine the day
they became available so I paid more than you would pay today.

DSL will change your computing life if you haven't used it before, HIGHLY
recommended. In fact, I would not buy a house in a neighborhood that did not
offer broadband support, it's that big a difference. But frankly it won't
have a tremendous impact on the EQ experience. I was incredibly suprised to
learn this when my DSL went down for a week and I was forced to use dial up
till they got it back up and running. I noticed virtually no difference in
game play other than a ping of around 350-450 as opposed to my usual 70-80.

Yes, other than the video card you are set, don't listen to the brand
monkeys, most of these systems use similar core components and imo a Compaq
= a Gateway = a Dell, etc. I bulid most of my own systems so I don't use any
of them, but I always recommend these brands to people who don't build them
and want something that will be supported (yeah, yeah, so flame me brand
monkeys). A significant video card upgrade is typically one of the biggest
bang for buck performance increases for a gaming rig, particularly one like
EQ that pushes the limits of 3d gaming.

See above. It's really the first thing I would focus on. You might also ask
for another 512k of ram. Having a lot of ram is a very good thing for big
games like EverQuest that use it. IIRC, Luclin requires (or maybe
recommends, I don't recall) 500mb minimum, which is what you have. Minimum
system requirements are always at the very bottom edge of acceptable system
performance, and usually below the standards that most of us aspire to. And
Ram is *cheap* these days. Don't scrounge on it.

Make sure that any router you use supports PnP or you'll have potential
trouble with online gaming. They will say PnP support right on the box,
typically. Linksys and Netgear both provide good standard routers that are
PnP based and work well with EverQuest. Other types of routers can create
all sorts of trouble (for example, when I used my Sonicwall, non-PnP
supported firewall/router, it never worked with ingame chat in EQ).
