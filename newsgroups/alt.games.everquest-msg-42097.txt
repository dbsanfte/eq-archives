What would be a good 1HS weapon for a low level Bard (so, nothing that
procs at 35, please ;) in the 500pp range (I can go as far as 1k if it
would make a huge difference, but given that Parsifal is under the
damage cap, that seeems unlikely).

I'm slightly ashamed of myself for having so wholeheartedly embraced the
world of twinkage, but given how much my main has to sweat and suffer
for every pixel of experience, I really like to be able to kick some
butt and see the XP bar move, for once. And hell, I've earned it. :)
