There's an NPC cleric in the Stone bridge tower in North Karana who'll do it
for either 5 or 10 gold.  He's a representative of the Temple of Life in
Qeynos.

There's another NPC cleric downstairs in the Temple of Marr of Freeport (in
the merchant area of the temple down off to the side, not in the main
sanctuary room).  He'll cure you for 10 gold.

In Qeynos's Temple of Life, in addition to the rabid wolf pelt quest with
Priestess Caulria, there's another NPC in the same temple...a male
cleric...(forgot his name... Tonmerk Plorson?  I know that's close, but
wrong)... He'll cure disease for a bandage and a Bog Juice (hail him about
it...he's pretty funny).
