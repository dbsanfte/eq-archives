While I never ever go out grinding without KEI, I want to keep my wis
right around the cap for the eventuality that I will be without KEI
one day and might need the mana.  Better to have it and not need it
than need it and not have it, as I like to say.  But that's just me.

Since I'm your typical soloing, anti-social druid, my next focus item
I'm getting is the extended affliction Coldain Military Wristguard.
After that I would like a either affliction efficiency or extended
enhancement.  Last one I need is the healing bonus one.

Still, this is all in the far flung future after I've made some more
money.
