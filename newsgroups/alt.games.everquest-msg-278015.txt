That's a guess.   I'd say a better guess is they haven't because they
didn't want to open the floodgates by losing a battle strictly over a
legally questionable aspect of the EULA.  By establishing their own
'service' they eliminate a lot of the potential pitfalls in the EULA
by simply pointing out they're not denying any customer the right
to transfer ownership, etc -- those arguments become moot.

Whether you like the 'service' or not, or think it ruins the game
or whatever, one thing's pretty clear -- they'll be in a lot better
position after it's implemented to legally go after IGE/whoever.
