Well, some might say that since you were playing a Ranger, there was
nothing to lose to begin with :)

But no, you haven't lost anything except custom keyboard and hotkey
settings. All character information is stored on the server.

You can reinstall EQ (and of course download about 50 gigaquads of
patches), log in with the same info, and you'll be good as gold.
