What I did was got a few guildies together and hit Iceclad for Cougars near the
Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This was great experience and grabbed a couple of
cougar claw earrings to boot.  Stayed here till I was 35, then we moved our
little band of adventurers over to the Great Divide and hunted the Tizmaks and
Kodiaks.  I've just reached 37 in little over 2 gaming sessions.

Also, a great place to solo if you're in good with the Coldain is the Mines of
Thurgadin. Now granted there are only bats, rats and a few spiders in here but
lemme tell you, if you wanna get your pally through 35 hunt in here!
