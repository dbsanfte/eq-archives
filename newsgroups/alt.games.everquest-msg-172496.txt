I assume that charm produces a pet at "low amiable" then?

If noone knows for sure, is there an inexpensive quest anyone can think of that
requires "high amiable" (results of quest unimportant, just want to test this
out without blowing hundreds of pp in gems.

Barring this, I have thurg quest gloves on my cleric that I haven't been able to
Give away (funny me, I planned to sell the MQ when they dropped for me as I was
soloing for faction), I can try harder to do so, and bring 4 gems instead of
three.  I'll hand over the gloves off my cleric, then one gem off my bard (with
mob charmed) then have the recipient hand over two more gems.  If they get the
item, then charmed is sufficient, if not they can hand over one more gem to get
the item.  If this fails too for some unfathomable reason, heck, noone wanted
the darn gloves in the first place!
