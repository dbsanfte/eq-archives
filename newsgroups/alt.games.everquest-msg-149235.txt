OK, I'm not answering this question... I'm just flabbergasted by the last
restriction
there.

Ranger track is astoundingly good.  Far far better than druid or bard track.  If

there's a quest out there that meets the other qualifications but requires that
you run around in a zone checking track then a ranger is the ideal class for it.

I've run around zones tracking with my bard, with my druid, and with a level
10 ranger... and the ranger had the other two beat hands down, the only thing
they have on him is range, and a ranger's skill caps out so much higher than
druid or bard (both classes capped out to their class max) that its not even
a close contest.

As a cleric, you wouldn't see me asking for a quest that didn't require Invis
to Undead, or Atone, or healing... why would you rule out the one thing
you are absolutely best in game at?
