Who are you losing aggro to and in what situation?
At your/our level Lammy's should be fine, an off hand centi LS is a better
choice than the lamentation as you have noticed but still you should be ok.
I use Bloodpoint and Bloodfire (am after another weapon to use if BF procs
early, Venomous Axe, another BP or Club of Ice ocean) and I sometimes take
"unwanted" aggro if these proc to early in the fight so maybe look at one of
these.
You can often hold aggro better with a big hitting 2hder but a lot of misses
in a row can be painful and getting back aggro with one is not always best
advised. If you are getting something like SLtW from an enchanter then maybe
a 2hder would be a better choice.

For proc'ing 1hders look at Blood point (to replace Lammy in primary) or
Venomous axe of the velium brood (to replace either but would suggest using
off hand to a Lammy) or if you can afford it, club of the ice ocean.
