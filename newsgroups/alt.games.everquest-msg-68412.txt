I'm running an AMD K-6 III 450 MHZ, 384 MB, SB Live X-Gamer, Leadtek
GeForce2 GTS/Pro 64 MB DDR. Nothing is overclocked.

Game told me I could load up to 20 of the new models. With 20 selected, the
old world seemed fine even with the retextured zones installed(ran around
Feerrott and Oggok for a bit), and with the clip plane fully extended. The
only complaint I have so far as that my fogging appears to be off, making
things kinda tacky graphically(things just pop in like pieces of a puzzle
rather than fading in from the fog).

Luclin was a bit of a different story. It was playable, but very jumpy and
choppy. Logged out, returned to the old models across the board, and things
were a bit better, though I had to pull the clip plane in to at least
halfway, which makes things even tackier with no fogging.

Haven't checked out the socials yet. As far as the models, some look quite
good(I liked the Dark Elves specifically, but go figure). Some of them, on
the other hand, look like a sheer waste of perfectly good RAM(Humans,
Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes specifically).
