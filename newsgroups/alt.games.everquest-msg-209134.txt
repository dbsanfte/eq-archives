AGI seems to help defensive skill-ups (Defense/Dodge/Parry/Riposte),
so I could see pushing AGI on a "not gonna be twinked" Ranger who
was expecting to spend most of his time grouped and not the MT of
choice, just to minimize the time it took to get those skill-ups
(a twink could obviously handle it even better with some temporary
gear).  I used to ask for an AGI buff only when I was MT and it
seemed to me that I was marginal for the role in terms of AC/HP.

just my $.02
