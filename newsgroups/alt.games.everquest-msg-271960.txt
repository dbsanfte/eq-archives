They should actually state the bonus in the game, to make sure people are
aware of it.  A bonus to encourage people to move around works better if
people know about it. :-)

In DAoC (and in WoW and CoH, for that matter), when you kill a mob it tells
you how much XP you earned.  DAoC gives you the total XP, and how much of
that came from the camp bonus, and, if the mob was part of a grouped set of
mobs, how much was from the group bonus.
