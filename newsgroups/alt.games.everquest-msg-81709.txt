    Based on the .sig, you're a monk, no? Monks have it hard in the cash
department - no services that can be sold (a fair chunk of my clerical
income is just stuff folks give me for ressing them), some gear slots with
steep prices if you don't get lucky on drops (haste, weaponry, inventory
slot items), and not a lot of weight capacity/pack space to carry sellable
cash loot out of dungeons (compared with other classes). If you are a monk
I'm not terribly surprised at your poverty. I try to make sure that if
someone in my group pulls bodies to me for ressing (say) that I split res
money with them, or if someone pulls a groupmate's body that they get paid
as if they did half the res. Helps spread out the goodwill a little. :-)
