Getting my CHA up to where it is now - about 124 I think - made a
significang difference in the number of cham/mezz related resists that I
saw. For fairly resistant mobs of about equivalent level to me, I went from
perhaps 1 resist in 7 or 8 to perhaps 1 in 15. It's worth noting that my
numbers seem to be drifting back down again of late, but I've been on a
leveling streak and am seeing tougher mobs. I'm working fairly hard on
GM'ing smithing, and my GM trophey will tack on 50CHA, so that will be
enough to do some pretty serious testing will. I'll let you know how it
turns out when I get there (give me at least another couple of weeks though
before my smithing is high enough to try for the GM trophy). Of course, once
I get the GM trophy, my care for CHA in most any other slot is going to wane
quite a bit - I'll probably often just take what extra CHA comes along with
the possible exception of my seaswirl braclet.
