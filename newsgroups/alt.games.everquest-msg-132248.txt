LOL ok, way more than 1 million.
Put it this way let say eq right now has about  35,000  subscribers in
the US ( Don't belive anything higher that 40 , some companies *cough*
like to count Characters and not account, but lets just say out of my
ass 35).
At 12.99 a month thats $454.650 times that by 12 and we
get...$5.455.800 , total cost for the year is close to $1.5 give or
take a few 1000. ( these numbers are all hypothetical of course)
Thats minus what they have to pay the 2 international server and rent
for them.

After taxes thats $3.273.480 minus 1.5 mill =1.773.480 . OK that
should give you an idea of how hard it is to get a game company
running. Just look at at the ones that have died. One bad game can
sink a Multi million dollar House, Remember Diakatana.

Of course International accounts in the East and Europe should net
them another 2 mill easy. But it comes real close to just cutting even
which is not what you want to do. One unforseen event and your in big
trouble.

Imagine if you will:

San Deigo , California.
A major earthquake hits the the metro area and communication lines are
down, Building are evacuated untill an agency can say they are safe.
Servers burnout and data is lost. 
They could never come out of that unharmed, it woulld take them at
least 3 year to catch up to where they were at.They could switch
everything over to their international severs, but they would overload
and shut down. Bad Times.But they do have reserve income. so have no
fear. )

So when SWG comes out it will be a Big Cash Cow, hundreds of SW geeks
out there, i'm one ). Hopefully they'll get enough cash to cover all
costs up to release and then some to split with upcoming project and
of course EQ will get some..

Wow OK now I'm tired of thinking....
But in the end it's up to Exec. the suits. that decide where the money
goes. it's sad. It'll be werid when that day comes when EQ goes down
for good. ( But hey theres all way EQ2.
