To me, part of what makes a race/class combo fun are the little bonuses 
and penalties, this race has more int, that one has regen, that one has 
a bonus to exp, that one a penalty, and so on.

I feel like I've been slapped in the face with this radical change to 
the exp system; part of the reason I went with a gnome SK rather than an 
Ogre one was the substantial xp penalty the ogres get.

It wasn't crippling, to be sure, but it was fun for me to be able to 
lord it over an ogre buddy I often group with, when I'd get 5 blue and 
he'd only get 4, despite our being grouped together for the whole time, 
and being the same level.

He'd lord it over me when his higher stamina gave him massively more HP, 
when his ogreliness gave him the ability to not get stunned  from the front.

Now, lacking the xp bonus, I have only the fact that I don't need a 
shrink in order to MT indoor raid content that needs to be cornered. 
Honestly, how often does THAT come up?  Maybe if we were warriors!

Berg, 60 SK, Combine, getting zero exp per kill just like all the other 
level 60 and at the limit toons on Combine.
