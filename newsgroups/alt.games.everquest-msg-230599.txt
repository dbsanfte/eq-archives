Well, think of it like caster focus items.

Where as bards may only have 1 focus item held at any one point. As a
whole, you can get 2 so say a percusson and brass by having rings,
etc, save swapping, but some songs require the instruments, much like
reagents, others just work a hell of a lot better with the instrument.
LDoN allows a couple of augs which help. 

One of the biggest pains of being a bard is the requirement for 4
instruments, well ok you can get away with 3, brass is less needed
except for extreeme measures.  but, often they wont co-incide with
your weapons, so, chances are thats like 6 items, eg a backpack full,
plus, you then need to be able to swap them fairly easily.. so, thats
prim, sec, and at least a bag on your hot keys..

Having epic which boosts so much means you can call on the spells
which have requirements without swapping, plus have an overall better
effect from absolutely everthing you do.

I am 1 set of trak guts from my epic. And i cant wait!
