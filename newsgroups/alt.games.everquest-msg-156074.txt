Who said bad guy?  I always try to keep in mind, whether I like a change in
Everquest or not, that the intent is not to "get" somebody or "teach someone
a lesson" but to improve the game.  Sometimes they get it right, sometimes
they don't, but I never have said they were the bad guy.  And the fact that
"they" is SOE and not Verant will likely never dissuade me from referring to
them as Verant.  I have many character flaws; this is one of them.
