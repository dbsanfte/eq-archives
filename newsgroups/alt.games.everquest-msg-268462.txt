In my limited experience it's very dependent on what class/how many other 
group members there are.

If you're in a fairly large group with a lot of casters, you might never get 
more than a swing or two in.  In a smallish group with just one or two 
caster types, you'll get as much or more action than anybody, most likely.

And of course, to make things less boring you could always go the solo route 
more often.  :-)
