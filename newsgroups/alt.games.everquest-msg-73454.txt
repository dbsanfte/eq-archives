Ok, I have come up with the following so far:

- As Iksar, a full suit of hate armour (has a few resists)
  This has to be exchanged by other pieces though I fear.

- Imbued Granite Spaulders from The Whole
  These seem to have a 10/10/10 Mg/C/F resistance. I heard mixed
  comments on how hard they are to get: From very hard to
  'What? I had them drop within one hour regularly'

- BD bracelets ... so far I have one

- D rings. So far one as well.

- Froglok crown

- Some white something necklace off the noble in Guk

- A player made face piece .. forgot if it was a D or BD

Any other suggestions, mainly for all the armour suit slots?
Preferably things that don't give up *all* the AC or Wis I
have of course. Oh, and Iskar wearable :)
