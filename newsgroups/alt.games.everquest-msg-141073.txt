Ragefire lists...pfft

We done ragefire through brute force back in the days. Just engaged them
first and got our clerics ragefire. Thats how it we used to do it on xev
last year.

Why was it done like this?

Because the entire server is FFA.

On another note I find the ragefire camp to be the best team building
excercise
