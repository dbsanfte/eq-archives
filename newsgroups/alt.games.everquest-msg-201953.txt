I can't believe I am helping yet ANOTHER druid learn how to kite, but here
goes. ;-)

You've got the basics down, but you need to refine it a bit. The main thing
you need to remember is NEVER waste the mana on single-kiting. You said you
were down to 47m when you were done. That was for one gorge hound right?
That's not mana efficient. You always want to triple or quad kite. Sure you
will be down to 47m when you are done, but you are gaining 3x or 4x as much
XP for each round. That's mana efficiency. I know it sounds scary to go
after 3 to 4 mobs at a time, but for you druids, it really is the way to go.
Once you tag your targets, run them in circles, this will eventually pull
them right on top of each other, this makes it easier to use your AE spells.
Oh, and don't tag more than 4 at a time. You can't do damage to more than 4
mobs at a time, even with an AE spell.

Stay away from caster type mobs obviously, stay with melee types.

Get some focus items. You said it's been a year since you last played. I
can't remember if focus effects had been added to items back then, but what
this does is reduces the mana costs or increases the potency of your spells
with certain items equiped. These items have been in the game for some time,
its just that their effects are new. Check your inventory, you may already
have some.

Go to www.eqdruids.com. Wealth of info there. About enough to choke a horse.

Hope that helps. Once you learn how to quad-kite, you'll never go back to
single kiting.

Lord forgive me for helping ANOTHER druid. ;->
