Well, in my case, I was being unconvinced, as I could not get to the popup
from ZA to answer the question one way or the other, I had to end the EQ
task, then, sometimes, the ZA popup would still be there, and I could allow
EQ to access the internet.  Alternatively, I would have to go into ZA and
manually allow the new EQ to access the internet.  It was annoying enough
for me to just shutdown ZA when playing EQ.
