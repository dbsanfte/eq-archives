Seems at this time, it's mostly "ubers" doing the hunting with their
guilds. Most sub-50 characters are alts, and most people seem to want
to go explore with their mains before taking alts into the chaos.

I managed to get a full group with my 28 rogue into Deepest Guk. It
was fantastic. Not only made the goal (kill 50 mobs), but had about 15
minutes to spare, that's even with a wipe because of someone opening a
rather nasty disease trap before I had a chance to stop her and tell
her to let me check for traps. ><

Few small augment gems dropped. Nothing remarkable, but okay boosts
for that level. Best drop, though, was a range slot item with 5 to all
saves as well as 5 ac and some dex. Not bad for something dropped at
30-ish. Tragically, I lost the roll. :(

As you gain points, more items will appear on the adventure vendors.
I'm not sure what the range is within the "cost" of an item, but at 2
points I was seeing some 10 point items showing up (was a rather easy
adventure)
