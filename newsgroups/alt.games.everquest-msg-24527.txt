High indifferent is enough.  Illusion dark elf plus alliance works
fine for an agnostic chanter.  (Just alliance if you're truly dark elf)

You can always hail him and make conversation to be sure.

The quest is really made for druids.  Turn in around 20 froglok pickles
to Chef Dooga while in wolf form and you'll be able to turn in the
Compendium to Clurg.  My druid's faction is pegged on the high side of
"allied" in Ogre town.
