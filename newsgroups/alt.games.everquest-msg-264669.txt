No question, if you are buying a laptop for portability, and the ability 
to use it while it is not plugged into a power outlet, go for the M.  If 
you are buying it strictly to play games, and expect it to always be 
plugged into a power outlet, go with the 4.  I'm not quite sure why you'd 
pay the extra cost of a laptop in a case like that, unless maybe you have 
very limited space, or like to go over to friends houses to play 
alongside them or something.
