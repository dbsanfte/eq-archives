I play both, when I decide to make a character, I decide beforehand
who and what it will be, physically, professionally, and personality,
then I create. I was disappointed, for example, to find that a
barbarian cannot be a bard last night. I settled on a half elf, but I
think I will re-create her as human, as I don't like the way it's
turning out. 

On a side note: I know it's been done, and I even tried to be careful
of it, but: Moron move of the day.

I get enough to buy some spells, so I get Battle Hymn and Chords of
Dissonance. I sit in the guild, scribe and mem them. I go to create a
hotkey for them to practice twisting. My mouse slips off the
Dissonance gem before it turns in to a button, and I begin singing.
Having never tried a Bard before, and knowing little about them (main
reason I created one) I tried moving, then sitting to interrupt. As I
die, I realize that little or nothing interrupts a bard..... LOADING,
PLEASE WAIT. <sigh> I guess it's better to make mistakes at level 1,
no?
