So, in your world-view, it's good that the hapless foreigners get to 
work insane hours in miserable conditions for a pitiful salary, only 
because it's marginally better than actually starving to death, while 
Americans at home lose their jobs and health insurance to outsourcing, 
so that the already obscenely rich executives of the companies involved 
don't have to face the agonizing prospect of, say, not buying themselves 
a new Porsche Cayenne Turbo this weekend because, really, they should 
have gone a bit easier on the coke and whores the previous month?

Hm... never mind. Consider the above a retorical question.
