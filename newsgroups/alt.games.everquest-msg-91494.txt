What about the ATI All-n-Wonder Radeon 32MB DDR card?
I'd like to get one of those (would get the 64MB version but higher cost +
have to upgrade to XP first...which means more bugs).
Have they fixed the issues with it yet? I'd like to get it but at the same
time don't want to not be able to enjoy EQ as much either (though I've been
busy lately so haven't logged on in nearly a month).

What issues do people with that card still have (like some cards have the
problem of trees and certain things like that flicker in shades of gray and
show up through everything. So if a tree is on the other side of a hill or
building you'll see the leaves directly in front of everything else)?
