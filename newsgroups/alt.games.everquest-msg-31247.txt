An *average* spawn time of about that, yes.

WHOA, there.

An *average* of 6 hours is not the same as "six or so hours
after the last time he spawned".

I have gotten two Gynoks in back-to-back spawns (15 minutes apart),
and I have also sat there for 26 hours straight before he showed up.

A coin will turn up heads an *average* of every other coin toss.
But that doesn't mean that you can wait for a head to show up,
then come back two flips later and expect another head to be "due".
