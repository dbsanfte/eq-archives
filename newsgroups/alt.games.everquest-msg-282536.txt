Man, it just never ends with them. It appears you can purchase the retail 
version of the upcoming EQ2 expansion, Kingdom of Sky, for $29.99. It 
includes the full version of EQ2, so new players don't have to break the 
bank to get into EQ2 (nice that they seem to have finally learned that 
lesson), but it also comes with in-game rewards compelling enough to make 
the existing player forego the $3 savings on the digital download version 
to buy the retail box. Then, since it includes the full version, anyway, 
why not just open up a second account to get past that limitation on the 
number of characters I can have? Crap, now that I've done that, I still 
need KoS for my original account. *sigh* May as well also buy the digital 
download version...except then I won't get the cool rewards of the retail 
box.

To the EB Games clerk: "I'll take two please..."

They always manage to come up with crafty ways to milk their player base.

Oh, and yeah, yeah, I know. I don't play anymore, so why do I feel 
compelled to come here and dog them? Well, because this is the very reason 
I don't play anymore, though I still enjoy reading about the goings on of 
the a.g.e. crew, so anyone with a problem with it can just...er...go do 
something else...or something. :P
