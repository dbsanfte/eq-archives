I dunno, Graeme. While I haven't been to Italy, I have been in other
countries and I can't imagine that I could go into a public establish-
ment, act out and them NOT have the legal right to remove me if they
so wish. I mean, if I had walked into a Turkish restaurant or bar
and started talking loudly about how stupid Ataturk was (which he
wasn't, this is just an example), if the owner or patrons hadn't
beaten me silly, the Turkish police would have probably been called
and I would have been removed from the premises (and then probably
beaten silly. :P Don't mess with Ataturk in Turkey. :) )
