What zone would you suggest?

We are talking necro and druid. Both outside type characters.  Both
always looking for group.  Snare, fear and pet.  Almost no adds, port
almost at fighting point, zone to your back.  PLUS you get spells.

The two of them could level up to 60 and not even come close to death.
