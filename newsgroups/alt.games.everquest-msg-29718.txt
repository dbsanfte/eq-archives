Humm I'm definatly getting level 6 first.
So getting my pet out could be a problem ?
That could be bad if I have to run from trains a lot :-(

So was it simply the snare / root advantage of the druid ?
As a Necro I have clinging darkness now, but it seems to 
run out very quickly. Should I be waiting till they turn
and then darknessing ?

I was hopeing to go in at 6/7 and hunt the doorway to level.
I guess that I could get to 10 in Tox, but I don't think 
that I want to do that <G>.

Also I was going to try and print off some loot tables to 
know what to look for. Is there anything that looks *really* 
good or is *really* sailable ?

So by 15 I can move around the zone "safely" ?

My plan was to level up in the warrens and then move on to 
SBM when it comes out on the live boxes. Anyone know what 
levels it is for?

Cheers for the help,
