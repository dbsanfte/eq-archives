Well, as little as 25 mins if no one tried to run to the NW corner through
town or we don't have a bad wipe trying to get to SW corner (despite being a
LOT smarter than we used to be we still get first-time Hate raiders whom we
have to teach every raid...gets old, but we're a social guild).

Nope, no epic.  We're holding our breath to see if they actually FIX Rage
this time.  We've got 2 clerics who just need him, and 2 more that just need
King & him.  I figure we're going to turn very blue in the face....
