Despite saying that I'd never turn them on, I keep playing with them. 
Nice thing is they are very attention getting; when I get a tell the box 
pops up nice and large, hard to miss.  And having a different box for 
each conversation is nice in that it helps keep the threads seperate.

BUT

1) the boxes pop up in my view field.  In fact, no matter where they 
show up, its going to be in my view field or over one of my controls, I 
don't have a big blank space unused, who does?

2) the boxes can bury themselves under the inventory if I pull it up, or 
under each other, I've cleared out a few boxes only to find old tells 
that I totally missed.

3) since I keep clicking conversation boxes off so as to be able to see, 
I get two problems

3a) sometimes someone says one more thing... just as I turn the box off, 
so I see it flash on the screen but can't read it

3b) all record of the conversation vanishes when I close the box, if 
something happens and I want to look back at what was said I can't

One of my earlier characters has a seperate chat window just for tells. 
    Seems to me that I need to go back to that; I'm using the Tell Box 
thing as a substitute for that so as to retain my leaner windows setup, 
but its not really anywhere near as nice.
