Hmm, it seems that you raid with people who are about as good at
Everquest as you are.  A mass CR in the planes now?  Come on, sure it
happens on your first time, but you're not a bunch of 46-50s in quest
armor weilding Ykeshas.  
We raid 4-6 days a week, and we do have wipe outs.  Big deal, we
recover in 10-15 minutes, enough time to get a snack, hit the head,
whatever.  You are a career soloist, with no grouping or raiding
skills, raiding with other like-minded players.  Of course you're
failing.

Damn, this much ignorance makes it look like you're the one who hasn't
made it past elementary school.  Since you're obviously ignorant,
group experience is divided up proporionally, based on level.  So if
you're with 5 other people your level, and you don't do anything other
than sit there and whine, you still get 1/6 of the total experience,
which includes a 20% bonus for a full group.
To make it even easier for you, assume that each mob gives 100exp if
killed solo.  You group with 5 of your friends, and it gives the
100exp plus a 20% bonus, for a total of 120exp.  Now you divide that
by 6, and each person gets 20exp.  This doesn't even take into effect
the additional dungeon bonus that Verant adds.  Now if your group can
kill 5 times as many mobs as you can solo, they're at least as
incompetant as you are.

You're level fucking 31?  Damn, even with middling twink gear even
warriors can still solo fairly well at that point.  The right dungeon
group can get from 31-32 in a couple hours, without twink gear.

You, sir, are an idiot who is very good at demonstrating your complete
and utter lack of game mechanics.  The very fact that you claim to
hung HGs for experience shows how poorly you understand the game
mechanics.  Here's a quick hint, for exp, nothing is better than
old-world dungeons.  They loot isn't that great, and they're not
designed to be soloed, but they have very nice exp bonuses, are almost
always empty, and have mob density much, much greater than any outdoor
zone.
