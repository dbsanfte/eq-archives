Nope sorry. I am not that into this game. Its a game.

I don't die, I don't take damage, I don't get stunned, etc.

Oh please its a design decision nothing more. I happen to disagree with it
you don't fine. Tell you what, you can still stare at the spell book all you
want if they take it away. Okay?

Whatever. Regardless of what window dressing you put on it its still
a poor design decision IMO. A pile of shit with frosting on it is still a pile
of shit, it wont taste like a cake. Boring the player is never a good idea.

I have a 45+ caster now and I wouldn't give a rat's ass.

What about all those level 60 SKs that leveled up there with the
old Hybrid calss exp penalty? Yet that is gone now.

In your opinion, I however disagree.


Look I am not asking for the moon here, I just want to see all the pretty
graphics I just downloaded and paid 30 bucks for. You'd think I was
asking for fire beetles to drop ToV loot. Sheesh.

Even if they made the book cover 50% of the screen, or made
some other penalty for spell caster but boring the player and
making them stare at a static screen for large portions of play
time is silly at best.

This has always been one of my big pet peeves with EQ and I have
hated it since day one. I like 99% of the rest of the game and its
approaching 99.5% with all the new changes recenty.
