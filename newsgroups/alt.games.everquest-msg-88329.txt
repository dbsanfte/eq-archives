So what you're saying is....
Charisma might have a variable effect on gaining faction????

Isn't that what I've been saying all along??  Isn't that what everyone else
is saying doesn't happen?

/em smirks mischeviously
/em ducks for cover

More seriously, though--
so what you're saying, is that my Qeynosian Paladin's faction increases with
the Tradefolk Illegial (with a charisma of 94) outstripped my Barbarian
Rogue's (charisma of 58), not because higher charisma of the Paladin gave
any helpful bonuses, but possibly because the lower charisma *might* have
given the Rogue a penalty?  (If, for the sake of argument at this point, we
ignore the possiblilty that the Rogue may have been almost dubious, and the
Paladin may have been almost indifferent when they started.....)

I'd buy that as a possiblily.

From what I seem to getting from the majority posts in this thread, the
popular opinion is that charisma has _absolutely_ *ZERO* effect on faction
gain/loss.  Right now, my main concern is figuring out whether that is true
or false, even if that does involve charisma penalties.

I seriously doubt that a Magician and an Enchanter of the same race and
religion from the same guildhouse is going to see much difference with
starting faction with their local Rogues guild.  I chose them, because I
wanted to create as wide a gulf in charisma as possible, so I wouldn't be
spending the next two months focusing on this side project counting how many
Rebby's Rat Whiskers I have to turn in to get to Allied with multiple
characters....

BTW, if anyone has posted any authoritative source that states Charisma has
absolutely no bearing on faction gain/loss (a quote from Absor, findings
from other players experiences, etc, ) I have not seen them.  Seems my news
server isn't picking up all the posts.
