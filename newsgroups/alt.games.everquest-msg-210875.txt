Most melee classes suck at soloing... and, in particular, melee classes 
with no spells.  I loved the warrior characters that I've played simply 
because, when it comes to fantasy hack and slash, I like best to wade in 
with a big-ass two-handed sword or two one-handed swords and bathe in 
the blood of my foes!  Raaar!

Which, of course, doesn't explain why the hell I'm playing a bard now, 
except that I never have before and the character idea that popped into 
my head just screamed "bard" and in particular "Vah Shir bard."  At 
level 10, it's still almost like being a spellsword; Krenya still melees 
quite a lot, singing Anthem and Whistling Warsong and Hymn of 
Restoration.  She also gets interrupted a lot with stuns and plain 
bashes.  But that's what hotkeys are for.  Her fights are a lot more 
exciting than those of any other character I've played.

Still... I know that eventually she's going to get to the point where 
melee isn't much of an option, and her best bet will be to music her 
foes to death, and there's a chance I'll get unhappy with being a bard, 
and Krenya will have a career change.

We'll see.
