I did the pulling in DL a bit with my enchanter. If you can make the mana
strech the distance, then you have all the melees fighting constantly, not
one wasting his time running around (pulling). Usually id pull with shallow
breath, and just let one of the melees taunt it off me as I come in. If they
are being slow dispatching the last mob, ill just mez park it.
