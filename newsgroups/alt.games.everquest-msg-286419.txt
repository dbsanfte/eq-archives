I finally got around to setting up a web page about audio
triggers.  There's a tutorial on the basics plus how to add
more audio files and such, but most of it is a list of the
various triggers I've found useful and some thoughts on what
sorts of events triggers are best for.  (Mostly: things that
happen independent of any action on my part, like mobs trying
to Gate or people sending me tells or me losing autofollow,
plus warnings when something unusual went wrong with whatever
I just tried to do, like feign death failing or spells fizzling
or items falling to the ground because my bags are full.)

The page includes links to several audio files I recorded with
words such as "Fizzle", "Gate", "Rage", etc., and instructions
for recording your own either using your own voice or using a
synthesizer available for free on the web.

I did finally come up with a way to have an audio trigger when
someone sends me a tell, without triggering when bankers,
merchants, tribute masters, etc. say things to me as tells, so
that's in there, too.  And I even devised a way to use audio
triggers to tell what kind of bread/wine I (or anyone else) gets
from the vet-reward jester!

Anyway, if anyone's interested, it's at

	http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/triggers

Comments are welcome, though I fret that the most frequent
comment will be that I need to get a life! :-)  I'm particularly
interested in feedback as to whether this stuff is useful enough
to warrant adding it the link somewhere in the FAQ.
