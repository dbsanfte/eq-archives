1)	Stay in Sneak / Hide.

2)	Follow giants until they stop.  NEVER try PP on a moving
giant.

3)	If in doubt about how long he's gonna stay stopped, or which
way he'll be turning afterwards, DO NOTHING.  Patience is *the*
primary trait of a good Rogue.

4)	Get behind him.  Always, no exceptions.

5)	Get ready.  Remember, PP drops Hide, it *doesn't* drop Sneak.
If things go in the can, you're gonna need to cancel Sneak immediately
so you can run.

6)	Hit PP, wait about 0.5 seconds, then hit Hide (hit it too
fast, it'll say you can't do that).

7)	If you did it right, the giant won't even notice.  If you did
it wrong, cancel Sneak and slide-run for the border.

8)	Avoid the cyclopses.  They don't carry enough cash to be worth
it.

9)	Avoid the named giant(s).  They seem to run faster.
