I cannot recall ever receiving a personal tell from a GM substantially 
different than these, but I can recall two occassions in which a GM made 
public announcement of a banning.

First case, some yutz who had just been reinstated after a suspension 
for harrassment and vulgarity was banned for spouting profanities at a 
GM who responded to a petition that the idiot was harrassing somebody. 
   This player was apparently exceptionally clueless.  I thought at the 
time, and still do, that the public announcement of his punishment was 
meant to warn the general player population that mouthing off to a GM 
was _not_ a good idea.

Second case, within hours after the Lanys server was first opened it was 
publicly announced that some players (plural, actual number was not 
mentioned, iirc) had already been banned for "cheating".  When the usual 
shouts of "what did they do" immediately rang out, a GM sitting in GFay 
(where I was lagging at the time, nobody was actually playing that day, 
except the few who got a few levels and escaped the newbie zones) 
responded with words to the effect of "they cheated", and when further 
shouts of "how can we avoid getting banned if we don't know what they 
did" followed that the GM responded "don't cheat".  Actually got quiet 
in the public channels for a minute or two after that.
