No, it wasn't just a numbers game.

When guild1 and guild2 combined makes a 200 person raid, which kills a mob
that 50 people can kill, that is a complete zerg.

Guild1 wasn't too small to do it alone, guild2 wasn't too small to do it
alone.   They lacked the skills and execution to pull it off solo, so threw
multiple bodies at it until he dropped.  Thats why he was zerged.
