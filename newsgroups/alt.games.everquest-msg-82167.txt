Huh. Those bandits have been the bane of my existence, occasionally, but I
don't even remember one named Gundl. (though it's been awhile since I was in
BB) Sure it was a bandit? (not saying you weren't paying attention, only
that I sometimes get confused about this stuff, myself, and was just asking)
Sucked that you died. Sucked that the guards didn't even bother to kill him.
Oh, as an aside, if you ever get to West Commonlands, there are 2 Dark Elves
there, one named Gix (who stands rather too close to the tollgate for my
preference!), the another named Dragoon Xytl (who wanders about a lot and
has a pet). Anyway, my point is, just zone if these guys start beating on
you, because A) they're serious undercons and B) the guards won't even
bother to kill them for you. I've died more times to those damn things than
I have fingers on one hand. Just a heads up. Can't help with Gundl,
however.... sorry. Hopefully someone else here can.
