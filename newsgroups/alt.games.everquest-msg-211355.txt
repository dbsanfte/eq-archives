The examples in nature are factual yes, but in each case the group
that that animal belongs to either kills the one with abnormal
behaviour or ostracizes it.

The survivability of a homosexual gene is not possible except as a
mutation.  Asking me to explain it other than "breeding out" is not
possible since that is exactly what happens.

I am not part of, nor do I wish to be part of any organization like
the KKK or Arian Brotherhood, or whatever.  I do have generalizations
based on race but they are exactly that, general.  A horse is a horse
is a horse, but there are different breeds and they are each better at
some things than others.  The same principle can be applied to the
human animal.

I mentioned the religious aspect because several people targeted
Christianity and Judasim as the main religious attackers.  My point in
the dialogue was that it's all religions, not just a few.  There is
significance in that fact.

All governments do regulate morality to some degree, my point is that
it should only be enough to keep social order.  Just because "Though
shalt not murder" correlates to a crime in society does not mean they
are regulating morality, they are attempting to keep order.  Two
different concepts that have the same outcome.

The fact that "in this day and age" is the answer to certain universal
constants is what causes the downfall of societies.  There are
universal codes of conduct that are required for a society to survive.
Homosexuality may or may not be one of them, but they exist.  And if
they are left to the "old-timers" that society will not make it.

I am not a hate monger no matter how you try to twist my opinions
here.  I believe homosexuality is unnatural (and nature backs that up)
and that it is morally wrong.  Beyond that I have no agenda.
