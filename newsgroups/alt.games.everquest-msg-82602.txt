   Fair enough, I suppose.  In a way its a bit of shame.
In other posts, IIRC, Carolyn's Mom does post much more
reasonably.  A regrettable turn of events, though I think
you handled it exactly the right way.

   As far as the "Drow" thing goes...  I don't use the
term in-game myself.  When I hear someone else using it,
it as the exact same effect on me as when I hear someone
using the term "dorf" for "dwarf".  It doesn't upset me,
and I would never correct someone for saying it, but
for me, it would mark that person as someone who is 
trying to dumb-down the game by making intentional  
mistakes.  Drow, or dorfs that matter, do not exist in
EQ.  This doesn't mean that I wouldn't interact with 
them in the game as I do with others, but it would
be red flag that I might be dealing with someone that
might not enhance my gaming experience (and yes, when
I play, my gaming experience is all about me).  So...
roleplay a Drow if you want.  Roleplay a battlebot if
you want, or Wolverine from the X-men.  But don't
expect me to play along side with you; I'm playing
Everquest.
