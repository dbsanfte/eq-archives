Last time I rode the boat I crashed as I zoned into East Freeport.    I
managed to log back in right after the boat zoned into Ocean of Tears again.
So I had to ride all the way back to Butcherblock, fuming, then stay on the
boat and ride all the way back to Freeport.    When we got to East Freeport,
I crashed while zoning again.  And logged back in in Ocean of Tears, again.
And had to repeat the trip, again.   When I got to East Freeport the third
time, I crashed a third time.

It took three complete round trips, three petitions, two guides and a GM to
get me to Freeport that night, over a period of two hours plus.   At that
point it was too late to join my friends, who had all been waiting for me,
and I logged off in disgust on the Freeport docks.

Thats what I think of every time someone mentions "the good old days when
people actually rode the boats."
