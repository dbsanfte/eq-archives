I never figured out how you can claim several spawns at the same time. 
The idea of camping is BEING there and waiting for spawns, isnt it?
And especially in BB where the dorfs are SO camped by druids, it would 
be impossible, and give a big black cross in my books if you try to 
claim that you camp 2 camps at the same time (especially since i know 
both the spawn times and the med time on docks and Den camp, unless you 
got some FT item you can not solo both those camps and be ready for pops 
at the other one)
