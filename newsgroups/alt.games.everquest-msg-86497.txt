No, but he's a certified mechanic. If you give it to Rafeal Scrubs who
you just met over on 24th street because Rafeal's sister says he is a
mechanic and an all around good guy.. you are basically saying "steal
my car!" 

Its a question of accountability and a perceived consequence. In this
case someone you don't know in real life seperated by several states
or oceans from you is just a little more brave in their anonymity.
