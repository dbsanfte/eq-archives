And the tank isn't obligated to taunt anything off of you either.
BS.  Of course a cleric is obligated to rez a group mate,
what the hell do you think he was invited for, his sparkling
wit?  In many (most) pre 60 xp groups a shaman was a better choice
as healer (for his slows) than a cleric, so why did we go hunting
for a cleric so often - Might as well say that shaman doesn't
have to slow the mobs or haste the tanks or heal the tank - damn,
it's fantastic when he does, but <shrug>.  Hey wiz, nuke when
you feel like it, it's nice when you do, but you don't have to.
Get the point yet.  We are talking about a group, you contribute
or you don't belong in it.
