Happened last week. No clue what might have happened behind the scenes,
but the statements made by both Brad and VI in the press releases were
all flowers and happy faces.  VI thanking him for all his hard work,
wishing him luck, etc. and Brad saying how rewarding his time working on
EQ was, but time to move on to other MMORPG's, blah, blah, blah.
