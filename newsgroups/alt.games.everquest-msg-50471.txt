For your Ranger, if on Faydwer, head over to Unrest and experience the
reason dungeon crawls are so much fun. (Might as well go to the worst
Train Station on Faydwer first..) Good loot, usually a plat or more in
cash from the mobs that'll be blue to you and some excellent drops.
(Banded armor and bronze weapons are fairly common)

The rest of your chars.. well the Barbarian can probably hit Blackburrow
(if the barb is still on Antonica) and your 11 druid would still do well
in Crushbone (again, assuming you're on Faydwer).
