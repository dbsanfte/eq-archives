I played EverQuest long before Luclin and PoP, too.

I'm not dreaming of returning to that world.  Access to fast and
easy travel is a great feature for experienced players.

You just aren't paying attention.

I'm NOT not not not NOT NOT NOT (*NOT* *NOT*) advocating getting
rid of fast and easy travel.  I'm advocating making it available
to experiened players in some reasonable fashion so that True Newbies
are still encouraged to explore the world SOE made!  I don't want to
take your precious books away from you.  Get it?  Get it yet?

Do you get it now?  I'm awfully tired of repeating it.

So your non-twink new characters may have to hoof it a few levels.
Big deal.  Everyone claims they can make level 1-40 in 7 hours and
42 minutes anyway.

*Rolls eyes*  Such drama.  You missed your true calling.

I don't think true newbies are cheating the game.  I think the game
is cheating them.  Of interesting, exciting, scary experiences they
will probably never experience, because hey, just click the book.

Me, and a lot of other people, experienced awe and wonder at the
breadth and depth of the world, when we were newbies.  It's too bad
you didn't.  I'd consider you the exception, not the rule.
