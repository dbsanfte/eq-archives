Ok, I thought you were implying by your "silent majority" statement that
there was no majority supporting kei.  If I was mistaken as to your
implication then I apologize.  This silent majority's existence, while not

point was not that the majority opinion is always right, but that when it
comes down to *preferences* the majority opinion is always right.
