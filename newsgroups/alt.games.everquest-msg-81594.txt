Is this Compaq a laptop?  I'm having a very similar issue on my thinkpad.  
I have an S3 Savage/IX graphics card, and I suspect that in my case it's a 
problem with the video driver.  I have looked for a newer version, but 
haven't found one.  I'm running XP, as I really need a stable platform 
more than I need to be able to play EQ on this.  I can still do enough to 
run a port-mule or do quest MQ on this, so I haven't done much more 
troubleshooting.

Any chance it's because the aspect ratio is slightly different on a laptop 
vs. a real monitor?  Not sure if this is an issue, but I know some 
adapters have different settings for the LCD panel and an external 
monitor.  Maybe I'll test this if I can figure out how to switch displays 
on this thing.
