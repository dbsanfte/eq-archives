I've had things like that happen to my Magician.  Being a Dark Elf, I
usually get the short end of the stick where Guards are concerned. 
Therefore, if I'm in a town zone waiting for someone, I make it a point to
be nowhere near the guards.  It avoids many problems.  Once, I was in
Freeport, smooshing rats for meat and ears and bats for wings.  (My faction
at the time was too low to use the merchant in EC that actually has
unlimited stocks of those items.  The Deathfist orcs had a miserable few
weeks when I found out about her.)  I was had summoned my level 35 Fire
pet, and was letting it play Death Machine with the bats and orc pawns,
when a level 12 Paladin runs up, and inspects my armor.  Repeatedly. 
Normally this doesn't bother me, but then he starts demanding that I give
him stuff, or he'll make me sorry.  Naturally, this has me both annoyed and
curious, so I summon him a Sword of Runes.  (After all, it has halfway
decent stats, and he can still get exp for fighting Ghouls.  Assuming it'll
go off, though I have no idea about that.)  He takes it, examines it for a
moment, and then starts cursing me out for handing him such a crappy
weapon.  Then he asks for a SoW.  (Bear in mind that as soon as I'd handed
him the sword, I'd gone back to decimating the local wildlife, none of
which lived long enough to even try my Fire pet's damage shield.)  When I
told him I couldn't SoW, that I was a Magician, he responded, in complete
dOOdspeak, that I was an "eVl terkeza drklf!" (I'm assuming the /Filter
choked on the middle word.)  And that he'd kill me.  And then he offered to
duel me.  At this point I was beyond fed up, and since he was less than
half my level, I agreed.  To his credit, he actually managed to last a
whole minute against my pet.  If he'd thought to zone, or turn and run to
the guards, instead of typing more insults at me, he might have even
survived.  And it's certainly not *my* fault that he was bound in Greater
Faydark.

Do not annoy powerful Magicians, for their fire pets will eat almost
anything if it's crispy enough.
