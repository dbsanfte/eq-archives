I know sometimes I drive my friends nuts because I am careful 
about my faction, turning down groups and asking that they not 
kill certain mobs ... I had no trouble getting faction in Paineel 
as a human cleric of Mith Marr however, killing kobolds infesting 
the warrens was a *good* thing as it prevented safe passage to 
people going to stonebrunt, and the people in Erud asked me to 
help with their kobold problem. It also gets me into the Hole, to 
deal with the evil that has infested that place as well... Just 
because the people of Paineel are evil doesn't mean that they 
can't be helped... so getting faction with an evil group is 
perfectly explainable in RP terms. I would have a harder time 
getting Kael faction as it does involve going against the good 
dorfs in Thurg, and my flappy buddies in Skyshrine. I have to 
look at chardok faction, and ikky faction to see if i can manage 
those logically...
