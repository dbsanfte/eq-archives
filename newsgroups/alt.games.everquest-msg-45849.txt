If you do this quest at level 1 the gnolls outside the entrances to BB will
ignore you. You only have to watch out whilst inside.
It would have been nice to get the hammer at level 1, but with all the
quests I took out of Halas (Mail, Lion meat, Clover shipment), I was level 2
when I returned.
I'm now Wisp hunting in Erud's crossing & still using the Hammer for the
job.
