If you're fighting giants while 2-boxing, use the Air pet, not Earth. The
giants will be hitting the pet left and right, and you'll spend too much
time healing the pet. Air dodges fairly well, since it has high agility - It
may have less hit points, but you won't be healing it as often.
Buff it with summoned weapons, an elemental defender, summoned armor,
burnout and a damage shield from your Magician, and whichever Cleric buffs
you feel like giving it.
