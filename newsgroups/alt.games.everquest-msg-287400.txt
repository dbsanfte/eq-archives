I'd say exactly the opposite.  I've played a priest, a hunter, a mage
and a rogue and each has had really amazing strengths (and
weaknesses).  Each one has been different and unique and interesting.
EQ's classes felt a bit cookie cutter... like theEQ  designers felt
the need for a new class so they took a little bit from this existing
class and a little bit from that class.

Nope.  Not even close.  Consider the difference between a shadow
priest and a holy priest.  One is a face melting damage dealer... the
other takes forever to kill things, but is a top notch healer.  Both
priests, but they've taken different talents.  And unlike EQ, you
can't just play a lot and get all the talents.  You have to make
choices.  Hard choices.

I'm not particularly sensitive about it... you're just wrong.
