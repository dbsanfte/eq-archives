"The unforgiveable sins this earth must confront and overcome are 
 Nationalism, capitalism, and hoarding.  The idea of every nation 
 should be forgot, price should be struck from the commons, and

to have, as I thought, as immediate an intercourse with Him, as a child
with a father. At the same time, she appeared most remote from any high
thought of herself, and of her own sufficiency; but was like a little
child, and expressed a great desire to be instructed, telling me that
she longed very often to come to me for instruction, and wanted to live
at my house, that I might tell her what was her duty.

She often expressed a sense of the glory of God appearing in the trees,
the growth of the fields, and other works of God's hands. She told her
