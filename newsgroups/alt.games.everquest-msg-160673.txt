Well, at the moment, I really hate raid.  I have 4 accounts, and can only 
afford one copy of PoP this month.  And if I 2box, I'd prefer to have my 
toons grouped.  This means, of course, that if I bring a character other than 
Zinny to a raid, no exp for either of us, since there's no way a PoPless 
group is going to outdamage the whole rest of the raid.

It also seems to me that raid is bad for the guild as a whole, since you're 
getting less total exp guildwide that way.

And here you want to rule out me being able to loot, too.  Thanks.  'Just add 
them to the raid long enough to loot' only works if they have PoP.  If you 
could add looters who aren't on the raid, that might work.
