You're killing me.  No really, get off.  OK, enough of the funnies.  The
greenmist by far has to be one of the easier epics to pick up.  Compared to
the regular sk epic it looks easy anyhow.  I only say this because my wife
at level 26 is half way there and is soloing for the required pieces...and
the next two quests don't look that hard either.  I am guessing that you
don't see many iksar sk's with the epice because you don't see a lot of high
level iksar sk's period.  I know on Prexus that if you do a /w all sk 60
that you actually don't get the message that says "there are too many
players to fit in this request" message.  Anyhow, thanks for the
theoretical, I was just thinking that for a guild that spent as much time as
they did making the crap weapons, they could have spent the same amount of
time getting their sk's using this, if it would have worked.
