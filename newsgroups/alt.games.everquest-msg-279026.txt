They hit harder because the INT and STR bonuses went into combat for
the mobs only.  As a result, the mobs got harder (both melee and caster
wise), but the players didn't scale with them, because their side
wasn't done yet.  To add on to that, the AGL and WIS portions weren't
completed yet, so the mobs got a ton tougher without the resists to
counter it.

It isn't that they hit harder and you hit harder.  It is that stats and
the 'quality' (if I can use that word in this case) of spells are
actually going to make a difference now.  By quality, I mean there will
be a visible progression and a desire to upgrade your spells.  No more
of this Master spell adds +1AGL over an Adept 1 version.  There will be
no more power increase while effectiveness decreases.  There will be a
reason for mages (all mages) to worry about their INT instead of just
for a power pool.  Everybody is going to worry about their WIS instead
of just healers (suddenly, that +21wis Combine Ceremonial Coif is
starting to look pretty damn good).

It is most definately not a zero-net gain change.  The end effect is
that stats are going to be meaningful (whether I agree with them or
not), group mobs will actually NEED a group, encounters will be more
challenging, and that yellow con isn't going to keel over as easy as a
blue mob.
