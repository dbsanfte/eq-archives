No question at all.  Probably the best xp group I have ever been in I was 
the main healer, and the slower/haster, grouped with a Paladin, Ranger 
(swapped out for a Bard at some point), and 3 Monks (One swapped out for 
a Rogue at some point).  We went completely nonstop, zero downtime 
clearing the BoT courtyard.  With the DPS we were putting out, slow was 
almost unnecessary, and the Paladin was quite capable of keeping himself 
alive while I was busy debuffing and slowing (for what slow was worth), 
after which I kept him healed up so as to preserve some of his mana.  I 
don't think I could have done it without Cannibalize and Torpor (better 
yet, now I have Quiescence).
