Hi,

the guards are all level 40 I think =(

Maybe a potion or another player ( there are plenty of them while camping
Icegiants and because of Permafrost ) could help you with invisibility.

I never had to try to go around them, but maybe faction can be adjusted too
....

Good luck, the money is worth it I think =)

Christian
