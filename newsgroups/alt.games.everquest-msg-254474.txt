No need to stop at 62 for a Ranger,in Bot or HoH you're
always welcome as puller(Harmony).
When I dinged 65 I had 4 AAs and these were from PoP flags.
I put them in Dex,was wielding Copper Hammer and Delightful
Orb at this time,and I dont regret it.
And before I got EQ/AM3 I took Innate Camouflage,helps a lot
with pulling.
I can see why some Rangers stay at 62,at this level there are
still some dark blue mobs,which you can head shot,but in
general I guess taking the BoT or HoH route is much faster.
