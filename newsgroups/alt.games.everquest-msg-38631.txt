Thank you Sang.

Like I've said before I sit in a zone with a lot of pick up groups and shout
"xx level wizard, LFG"  I watch EVERY OTHER kind of caster start looking
after me, and get a group before me.  I, know, Sang "because wizards are
useless," I've stopped trying to convince you, so piss off.  (Oh, sorry,
that's kinda like a last word... go ahead and respond to this telling me why
I suxxor <vomit>).

I was in DL once, and watched a group form of four guys who had just entered
the zone... all of them did an OOC LFG... as did I.  They then formed the
group in OOC (typing each other's full names so this wasn't a brevity
thing)... they were all about my level, so I did another OOC LFG.  After
another round of them deciding where to meet, I realized that these 4 tanks
just didn't want a wizard.

Okay it was childish, but:

/OOC "Okay, we'll take the kid in the wheelchair... you can have the
wizard."

Then I ported out.
