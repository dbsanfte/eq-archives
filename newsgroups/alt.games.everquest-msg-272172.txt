Who the hell are you talking to?

Between not quoting, and your fucked up posting method, I'm not quite sure I
can tell.

Which is, of course, the point.  If you want your posts to be read, so you can
do all those nifty things like contribute to the discussion, I'd recommend
taking steps to fix the problem.

If you want to be a newsgroup rebel (*snicker*), then continue as you have
been, as you're making a wonderful start.    Sadly I won't be seeing it, since
I'll be killfiling you.   But I'll learn to live with the disappointment.   So
far you haven't said anything worthy of the extra effort it takes to make
sense of your posts compared to everyone else's.
