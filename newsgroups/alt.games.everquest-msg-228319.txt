Aha! What indeed... and why not? Award them 'gaurd points' for lack of a 
better term, allow them to spend gaurd points on enhanced gaurd 
abilities... like player tracking, shield victim, weapons and items that 
bane 'bandits'...and set it up like charms in EQ where its beased on 
their gaurd rating... if they start to slide into rpk the abilties stop 
working and the items stop working etc...

I have a lot of friends that would perform 'gaurd duty' if they could 
get run speed 3 or some other desireable AA ability via sic gaurdpoints 
vs via AAxp (ie both routes available). And a couple of them would want 
to 'max out their gaurd characteristics', especially if their were 
fringe benefits to PvE involved exclusively available via gaurd abilities...

in a perfect world, the hardest part of 'gaurd duty leveling' would be a 
shortage of griefers, and in that unlikely case you could always award 
them a few special abilities too for being the best chaotic evil player 
they could muster... (And I *mean* chaotic evil... if they get their rpk 
points up high enough... they start getting messages from Bertoxx et al, 
with orders, offering prizes for performing even more rpk ... and 
punishements for failing to do so...

I dunno... I think it would be a hoot... ;)

And moreover, the bigger problem is that unsurprisingly RvR type 
scenarios eventually destabilize, and one side will become more or less 
indestructible. The only rebalancing possible is a split within the 
ranks of the winning team... but that requires complete player driven 
structures (a la Shadowbane), and even there it is not a given.
