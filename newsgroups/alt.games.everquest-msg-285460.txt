Ok, based on the reponses I've seen on this forum, and the level of 
expertise shown, I feel safe in posing the following scenario...

Been playing EQ for well over a year with older agp card, a GeForce 
FX5200... and did well... then found the same model but in a pci flavor, and 
thought Wow!! 2 boxing with 2nd monitor, here I come...

Needless to say, that didn't work real well... PC started rebooting 
randomly, so I removed pci and went back to the agp only... and still get 
random reboots while playing... and only when playing EQ...

So... did some research, bought a Sapphire 8x AGP 1600 w/512mb on it, 
installed per instructions provide and power cable provided... Boy what a 
difference to the graphics in the game... however... now it might take 3 
minutes or 30 but get alot of eqgame.exe crashes (Click yes to update the 
developers) messages...

I've got the OptionsEditor set for the new card, and even tried reducing 
everything to either low, or off if not needed, and still happening...

I've done complete file check and download (on dial up, took 47hours) and 
still getting the same issue...

Could this be related to DirectX 9? or has anyone else experienced this kind 
of issue?

Please... really need to fix this as I'm going stark raving mad without my 
game...

Thanx,

Glynn
