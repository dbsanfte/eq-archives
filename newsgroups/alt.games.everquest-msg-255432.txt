Is it worth it?  Well, I can say that I'm still equipping mine at 65
in a raid guild.  I have 5200 hp & mana and FT15 and around 170AA. 
No, it's not the greatest weapon by any means but I haven't come
across an upgrade in VT yet (we're not a Time guild yet).

You should be able to do most of it with a single group.
