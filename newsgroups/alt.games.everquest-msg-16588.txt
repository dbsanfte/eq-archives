I experienced the strangeness of a fully RPed beggar attempt.  I was
playing my Dwarven Cleric in the Qeynos area during the invasion of the
"loathesomes" et al and had a young Dwarven Cleric ask in full RP mode
if I had anything to give him.  Replying in character my Cleric told his
char "Yes, a thump on the head with my mallet.  You insult Brell himself
when you stoop to begging, as if his gifts are not enough for you."

Another time I had both my Cleric and my Druid in Rivervale swapping out
some inventory.  The Cleric was inside the bank when he was accosted by
a very persistant beggar via tells, while the druid waited outside to
avoid back pain from being in the bank too long.  My Cleric went about
his business totally ignoring all the tells.  A few minutes later the
beggar starting in on my druid,  asking if I had anything a young cleric
could use.  He was told that "I only wish I could give you the patience
of XXXXX(my cleric's name), did you notice that no matter how many times
you pestered him he completely ignored  you?  Now that is something a
cleric can really use in this world."

In short, beggars can be fun <EG>.
