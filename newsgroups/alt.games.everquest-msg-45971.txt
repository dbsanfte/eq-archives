My druid at 24 has base wis of 115, and 149 with items.

Prayer Cloth of Tunare, +3 on shoulder slot, one of the interim rewards for
the screaming mace quest, all you need is a bracer of battle from Crushbone.
Ulthork bracer, +1 wis, got it off a vendor =P
Gnome skin (or split paw) gloves, both are +2 wis (or are gnome +3?)
2x Plat jasper rings, +6 each, jeweler made
electrum jasper earring, +2
gold jasper earring, +3
Testament of Vanear, +10 wis +10 mana in off hand, no drop, so you'll have
to camp Dyllin yourself, well worth it though.


Been slaughtering giants in Warsliks for the past week trying to get an
elusive forest loop.
couldn't find a plat ruby veil for sale until AFTER I spent 250 plat or so
on my 24th level spells (ack!)
