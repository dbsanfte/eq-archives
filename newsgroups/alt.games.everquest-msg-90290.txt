Ever play a mage?  Granted, their more damaging spells are Bolts, but they
still get better nukes than us at equivalent level for the most part.  (just
a little FYI, but at level 1, CLERICS have the best nuke)

Yes, that immune to changes in movement speed thing is a lame cop out on
VI's part to enforce The Vision.

The player makes it solo versus group, not the class itself, I've known
plenty of solo clerics (confuses the hell out of me, but they do it)  and I
get to hear lots of complaining from one of my warrior friends every time he
complains that he can't get a group, and ends up trying to solo... ugh...

The real problem IMO isn't the weakness of healing at higher levels (which
nearly everyone interprets as NToV raiding for some reason) but the weakness
at middle levels, since we're stuck with that gimpy Greater Heal until level
51.   270 point heals on tanks with 2khp are REALLY DAMN ANNOYING.

Yup, Luclin just exacerbates the problem.

A well played necro is an excellent group asset, pulling the "solo class"
card out is a cop out.
