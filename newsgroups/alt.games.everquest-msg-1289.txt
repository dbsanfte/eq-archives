I am up to level 7 and now I am totally screwed.  Basically, everything in
this forest cons green to me.  Skeletons con blue, but they are few and far
between, and when I DO find them I get hardly any exp.  I got rid of my pet
in order to get all exp for myself, but it isnt helping.  After 3 hours at
level 7 I don't havea bubble yet!  At this rate I'll never get off this
island.  I even tried to sneak through erudin at get the qeynos docks and
jump inot the bay, but the Erudin guards glowered at me, and I did'nt dare
go any closer.  Can someone give me some advice on how to get to level 8 in
this dump?  Hell, I'd fight the fisherman over and over, but he's double
spawning for some reason and I can't beat both!  Thnaks!
