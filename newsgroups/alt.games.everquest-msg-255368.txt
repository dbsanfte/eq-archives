Actually, I think it's only about half that much, since my logs show
that applying a bandage takes nearly two ticks (11 seconds).  Throw in
the delay as you react to finishing one bandage and mash the hotkey
again, and it's even closer to two ticks per bandage.

Still, as you say, an extra 20 regen (25 at skill 200) is pretty nice. :-)

Just last night I was in an LDoN with just my monk, a warrior, and
a shaman.  The shaman did okay keeping us healed during combat, but
when he ran out of mana at one point and began to canni for it between
rooms, I sat down next to him and bandaged him back up.

Have you considered getting a gauze press?  A hefty initial
investment, but thereafter it saves about half the price of
each stack of bandages, and you basically never run out if
you're careful.

My monk occasionally considers getting one, but since he often
duos with a mage it hasn't seemed necessary. :-)
