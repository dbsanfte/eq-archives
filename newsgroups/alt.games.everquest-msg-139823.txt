While I am not quite that bad, I started Cel on someone else's account
and retired her at level 39. Two months later, I bought my own account
and restarted her with a couple stat changes and the old one's gear.
In addition to my hierophant, I have a small horde of druidlings on
other servers, should I feel like playing them. I have a halfling on
FV (first created as halfling, then made half elf due to languages,
then changed back to halfling after Luclin made those look very cute),
a human (so she can wear a dress), and a second wood elf (which is
going to be played as an unkempt druid).
