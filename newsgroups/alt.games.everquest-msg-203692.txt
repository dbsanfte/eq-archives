Atone (memblur)
Casting haste focus buff (the Blessing line) (19+)
Fear (both undead and regular MOBs and an AE fear)
Divine Intervention just-in-time heal line (51+)
Reverse damage shield (cast on MOB) (55+)
Cancel Magic line
Specialised damage shield killer (Mark of Karn) (56+)
Add Resists to stat buffs (MR, PR, DR, FR, CR)
"Zing" stamina increase buff/cures
Cure poison/disease/curse/blindness
Summon food/water

Pet (laughs uproariously) (54+)
Reckless Strength line (sobs inconsolably)
Sentinel "watch keeper" (breaks down completely and has to be carried
off on a stretcher)

The DS killer is in theory a damage shield that *heals* you when you
hit the MOB. Given that the maximum heal is 1-2 HP however it's used
almost entirely to remove damage shields.

I've omitted a handful of self-only spells since you're asking about groups.
