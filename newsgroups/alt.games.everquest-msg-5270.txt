I am wondering if there are any other stats that are important to a
Druid besides Wisdom?
I am currently at lvl 30 and these are my stats as of now:

STR:  78	
STA:  87
AGI:   118
DEX:  92
WIS:  159
INT:   90
CHA:  75

I've been told that pumping up AGI is important to spell casting but
I'm not sure why.  Is that so?  And I've been told higher DEX will
make weapons that PROC do so more often.  Is that so?

Thanks for the help =)
