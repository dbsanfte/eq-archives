Had the same problem here is what I did takes a bit of time but it works.
1st Create a evil character (DE Oger or Troll) run him to Oasis and take the
boat to OT. next log on your Cleric and consent your new Character and take
to boat to OT jump off the boat as soon as you see the wall to OT and swim
to shore run to the wall but stay on the outside side of OT. log on your new
character that has consent and drag your corpse to where your Cleric is
camped.
