Another option is to sell it and use the cash towards armor or a 1hb
weapon as suggested, but do the Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies quest.  
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1283
Fairly easy quest to do.  Procs spirit strike at 19, 81 pts direct

I suggest bringing an extra set of asp sacs with you, and you can
possibly trade them for the two foraged items, otherwise you will have
to bring a friend who can forage along.
