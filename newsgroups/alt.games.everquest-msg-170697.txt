Or, he might try following your "advice" over and over wondering what
the heck he was doing wrong and assuming he must have missed
something. This could waste a lot of time for him all for your twisted
amusement. He said he is brand new to the game. Why would he *not*
take you seriously? It's not like he can see the smirk of sarcasm on
your face or the mischievous (sp?) wink. Save the practical jokes for
when you don't stand such a good chance of ruining an evening for him.
