When I made canvas padding it took one fuel to make the canvas yarn,
same as for a tailor, but takes 2 fuels to make canvas padding from
the yarn, a tailor uses one fuel for this step. 

- Prices for the new fuel types have been adjusted: (price in
parenthesis above base level 0 was an interim change that won't go
live)
- Base level 0 - 4c (was 6c)
- Base level 10 - 14c (was 24c)
- Base level 20 - 58c (was 96c)
- Base level 30 - 2s 30c (was 3s 84c)
- Base level 40 - 9s 22c (was 15s 36c)
- Culinary recipes use different types of fuel that are less
expensive:
- Base level 0 - 1c (Walnut Kindling)
- Base level 10 - 4c (Mulberry Kindling)
- Base level 20 - 14c (Cherry Kindling)
- Base level 30 - 55c (Hickory Kindling)
- Base level 40 - 2s 21c (Mesquite Kindling) 

This was in the latest patch on test server.

Would take 1 to make lumber and 2 to make the staff.
