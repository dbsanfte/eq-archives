...so, extending the limits and capabilities of a character, thus,
making it easier, doesn't impact someone's ability to learn that
character's -real- limits and capabilities? You mean kinda like when
KEI had a minimum level put on it, suddenly tons of priests and
casters didn't know how to manage their mana below that level and were
constantly running out for a long time until everyone adjusted to it?
Or how when they could get KEI at low levels, wizards in groups were
spam nuking making it impossible for the tank to hold aggro...?

Having another 800 points has -everything- to do with learning your
class's limits, which is a huge part of learning to play your class.
