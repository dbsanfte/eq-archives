1. my ranger has just got to level 17 and I was wondering where the
best place to go was for the next 5 - 10 levels ?
2. I have got my archery level up to 40 but seem to have fired lots
and lots of arrows to get this far.  What is the easiest way to
improve this skill, and is it a skill that high level rangers use ?
3. I have managed to accumlate about 100 plat and was thinking of
spending the money on a 1hs weapon.  What would be a good weapon to
buy, i could possiably go up to about 150.

	Thanks
