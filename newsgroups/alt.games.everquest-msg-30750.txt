What room are you going into at level 7 ???
The only rooms I can think of are:

In the castle : No way at 7th even with a group of 10 - 12th levelers
Down by the pond : too many legos I would have thought
In the tunnels : Where slavers will eat you.

If you were trying to get into the castle (sounds most likely from your
description) at 7th I am amazed that you only died 8 times.

Correct me if I am way off base.
If not then next time you see that group leader, shoot him.

HTH,
Jim
