Err, 10 CD's is unlikely. Yes, they did a poll ages ago asking if
people would be willing to buy it in CD format if it was that many,
but that was to check to see if there would be enough interest in CD
format to bother printing it even if it was a large set. I clearly
recall saying that they didn't expect it to be that many (though it
will definitely be multiple CDs...).
