Personally I think it must be a line of Bullshit can't see a GM doing that.
But wouldn't it be great if once every 6 months or even once a year the GMs
help the players by forcing Rare Spawns time and time again. No advanced
warning just a series of local system messages that day. System Message
Ragefire will be respawnning continuously for the Next 3 hours. On and on
for 24 hours straight.
Day dreaming
