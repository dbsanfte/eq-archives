    If snare lands, then by the time I'm back to my pet I have Dooming 
Darkness, Splurt, and EBolt all going on the mob and it's coming after me. 
If it doesn't land, then by the time I get beside the pet I have no DoTs on 
the mob and I'll be lucky to get off Dooming again before the mob is in 
melee range. My necromancer's current camp is the wayfarer camp in Natimbi - 
I pull to behind the last tent, run the mob behind the tents to the corner 
with pet beating on it, then fear the mob so it runs back behind the tents 
again. By the time it gets to where the pet starts, it's below 20% health 
and about to die.

    My necro has SoW potions always. Some of the mob types are faster than 
normal, though, and it's more a matter of how quickly they close the space 
when I attempt to resnare. I also have limited real estate to play with in 
that area - I can run in circles around the tents, but given the stun/DoT 
procs of the mobs around there being caught really hurts.

    Once I cast EBolt, I have aggro - you'd know all about poison DoT aggro 
;-) . I usually like waiting until after I've cast Splurt to drop EBolt, 
since with my necromancer's foci the last few ticks of Splurt do a ton of 
damage and it can be the difference between reapplying and not reapplying 
darkness at the end of the kite.

    The 49 pet can take a beating until I peel the mob off him. The 53 pet 
is a rogue pet, and he's a worse tank than the 49 pet. He also does a lot 
more damage, so if I don't have my EBolt aggro lock he can keep a mob glued 
to him for longer than he has HPs. I haven't had a chance to play with him 
much. I'm sure I could switch to some other higher aggro DoT than Splurt as 
a second DoT to hold aggro better. I just noticed that, early after dinging 
53, I'd already lost one pet and I didn't lose the 49 pet all through level 
52 in the same spot with the same tactics.

    Now, I can handle this sort of thing. Here's the necromancer's Magelo: 
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=448294 Major twink, I've been 
caught and actually tanked for a short while until I re-applied snare. But I 
don't want to rely on my gear to carry me through, since very shortly the 
mobs will catch up with my gear and I'll need a proper skill set to be 
successful. Time to start learning!
