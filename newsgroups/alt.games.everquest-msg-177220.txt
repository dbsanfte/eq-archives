Are there any tradeskills that are both reasonably useful and not
outstandingly expensive to skillup?

Tailoring and Blacksmithing both seem to be popular but also extremely
expensive to learn. I've been considering:
- Baking - how much is required in terms of forages? I've heard it's not too
  expensive to get to 120 or so, but not sure after that.
- Brewing - similar issue regarding forages, and pretty concerned about
  the usefulness of the end-product.
- Pottery - there are some nice pottery items, and again I've heard
  low-end skillups are fairly easy, but I'm worried about how hard it is
  to hit GM level.
- Fishing is cheap to skillup AFAIK (mildly profitable, even), but doesn't
  seem deeply useful.

My main is a (53) cleric, so getting high WIS is generally not an issue.
My combat WIS is 221, add KEI and I'm maxed out.) However, it means that
I can't forage.

Cash expense is an issue, as I'm only minimally twinked and not very rich.
(Well, actually I have around 4000 plat to my name, which *is* rich by my
standards, but I'm saving desperately for my med-o-matic AKA horse.)
