I see no possible reason why they should delete characters, other than 
forcing you to keep paying month by month to ensure they're not deleted. 
Think about other games which let you save your characters/positions on 
your own hard drive. Since EQ doesn't provide that facility, they should 
at least provide a free service to keep characters on their servers 
indefinitely.

I'm going to be in this situation in December when I travel overseas. I 
won't be playing for a while, so won't want to pay for it, and don't 
know when I will be playing again. If I come back after 6 months and my 
characters are deleted I for one most certainly won't be starting all 
over again!

You're forgetting this is more work to implement which means its the 
least viable option in Verant's opinion. Besides, if a customer's not 
paying anymore then who cares about them, right?
