Cyrystic didn't hit Fergul first.  That's what pisses me off.  My friend
attacked after me.  After I couldn't get rid of the aggro, I died and Fergul
went after my friend.  I respawned at the bottom of the hill, ran back up to
see my friend run to get some distance so he could snare the adds.  When he
turns around, Fergul is gone and for SOME reason aggroed on Cyrystic.  My
friend goes back and tries to outdamage Cyrystic so we can get to loot but one
way or another, Cyrystic's group looted and left no leggings.
