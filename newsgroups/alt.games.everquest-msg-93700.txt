Of course I am important asshole.  Maybe not to you but, none the less, =
to my friends and family.  Hmm why do peons get so aggrovated when =
someone new has something to say or maybe wants to help people out...  =
no clue.

So, as far as I am concerned, fuck off.  It's people like you that are =
so arrogant that they think everyone else is nothing.
You should re-evaluate yourself and find that other people would like =
information also.  The reason this thread was included was for the =
general publics knowledge.  If you don't like it, go to hell.  By the =
way, thanks for header =3D).
