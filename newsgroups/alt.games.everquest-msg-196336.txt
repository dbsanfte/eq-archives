Me as well, *but* what men look for in porn is orthogonal (and more 
often than not directly opposite) to what they look for in their life. 
What someone may or may not find appealing in a particular porn 
performer is entirely different to what they may find attractive on 
someone they may be looking at as a real dating prospect. And someone 
could conceivably be a seasoned porn aficionado and yet not want his EQ 
characters looking like porn stars themselves.
