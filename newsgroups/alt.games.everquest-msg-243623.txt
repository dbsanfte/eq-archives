EQ 2 still not out, I see (CGW lists it as a June release now... any
bets?)

GOD seems to be out though.  I poked around a bit looking for
information about it, but all I managed to spot was Manual's post on
some loots he got...

Stupidly hard to get to, stupidly hard to recover from wipes, Time
quality loots... but does that mean GOD is out for those who aren't
level 65 and a years worth of high end farming under their belts?

Or does it Scale, like LDON?

Anything else fun or frustrating going on?

Other than the march 31 patch message, of course, I did read that,
sure is going to be something having my spell list alphabetized...
