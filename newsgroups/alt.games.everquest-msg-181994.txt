    We are. But as I've pointed out to you in other posts, you need to have
certain tools to do that. And one of the biggest tools, one that isn't found
in the elemental planes, is a high taunt 2HS for a main tank to hold aggro
with. I can't begin to tell you how bad it is when a mob that quads for 2000
gets that one extra riposte in, kills the main tank, and goes looking for
all the wizards and clerics that are next highest on the hate list. The
problem is so bad we've all but stopped giving elemental plate armour to any
class but warriors - they need every HP, and then some. One of our main
tanks recently got dropped by a mob that not only quadded on him, but quad
procced 3000 DD procs on him. You have to minimize every chance of something
like that happening if you want any encounter control whatsoever!

    Jazz - we just watched another guild kill Rallos, and not only did we do
nothing to stop them but we cheered them on. What deep part of your ass are
you puling this out of? Here are all the things we could have done to
cockblock, which we didn't:

(1) No rotation agreement. Kill Rallos every pop, let them whine.
(2) Train every attempt they make. It's easy to train key areas during the
event, trains that would be unpetitionable but which would force the guild
in question to restart. (Part of the strategy is to AoE X-loc everyone out
of the zone at two different times. At those times, there's a ton of trash
near the zone-in that could be trained there. Once at the zone-in, because
of the silly geometry it would stay there long enough for whichever
incarnation of RZ was there to depop.) As soon as they have to restart, move
in and take it for ourselves.
(3) Lag every attempt they make. With 150+ people already there, adding a
few more groups of people to the zone would have rendered it damn well
unplayable. Again, as soon as they wipe move in and take it for ourselves.

    All these things, and we did NONE of them. But we're the evil guild
here, the one that is clearly blocking the fun of the others.

    OMFG, wake up and get a clue! They didn't want FCFS, because they knew
they'd LOSE races to us. We didn't want FCFS, because then we get made out
as the evil cockblocking guild and we have to waste time sitting at a
zone-in until enough people are online. Pure FCFS is lose-lose on stuff
that's going to be hotly contested.

> Why make such an agreement at all?

    Because we aren't the assholes you think we are, and we value our time.

    Our clerics get PM's from other clerics in other top guilds discussing
research issues they won't post on message boards. Our warriors talk with
Furor in the serverwide warrior channel about tanking strategies, and have
his respect. One of our monks is a moderator for Monkly Business. Shall I
continue? Just because YOU don't know about it doesn't mean it doesn't
exist, no matter how much you think you know because you read FoH and
Graffe's.

    Those of us at the top know who the other folks are. A couple of months
ago we were doing trivia in /gu, and someone asked "Who is the big guild on
server X?" It was amazing to me how many people could name the top guild on
every server, even on servers which are pretty obscure. And they know the
gossip, too. So if we know about them, even the little "them", it stands to
reason they know about us.

> five guilds serverwide that carry that sort of an audience

    Top guilds usually don't cater to the masses. The ones that do are in
the minority. We play to beat each other.

    Not at all. You saw something that looked like BS, and went off about
it. But, and this is a massive "but":

    After over two years of seeing me post here, of seeing what type of
person I am and what I believe in, why are you believing someone else you've
never even heard of over me? I've laid out all the details of what happened.
I've clarified whenever I've been unclear or whenever you have misunderstood
something that was said. I've also pointed to supporting details that the
"other side" ignores, support that they never had. Why believe them over me?

    Tell me what part of this chain of events is distasteful, or what part
we shouldn't be angry at:

    -other guilds want to do RZ, ask us not to kill him and let them kill
him instead. We kill him for an item important to our progress in the
elemental planes
    -we reach an agreement with the other guilds on a rotation schedule.
This agreement is the result of negotiation and give-and-take from BOTH
SIDES. The members of all three guilds are unhappy with the deal, a good
sign that every side gave up something of value to reach a compromise. In
particular, the loot from the kill was offered to LC and was not demanded by
LC as a condition for a deal to be reached (our primary concerns were length
of time before it was our turn, and them not teaming up)
    -the other two guilds broke the agreement, both by teaming up and by not
giving the loot to LC. LC had every opportunity to be asses - by claiming
that the time RZ was permakilled counted towards the attempt time, by
rushing the zone on patch day and killing RZ, by sabotaging the actual RZ
zergfest - and did nothing.

    So what part of that pisses you off?

    James
