    Well, you're right about it being her guild and her rules... but she
also has a duty to make the rules very clear to her members, I feel.  Is
there a website anywhere that lists the guild's charter and rules?  Has
any mention of any rules been made at all?  If she is making snap "this
is wrong enough to toss you out" decisions then I think that her guild
is going to suffer greatly for it.  Sure, it might be funny to others
when it happens to *you* (and I'm not saying it was), but how will they
feel the next time someone, maybe a good friend of theirs, gets tossed
out with as little deliberation or ceremony?  It happens two or three
times and everyone is going to feel a sword dangling over their heads.  

   Saying "bastard" in guild chat doesn't seem bad to me, but we both
agree that it is her right to call shots like this.  Still, she could of
handled it better.  A simple tell to you of "Hey, I don't think that's
appropriate language.  I mean this guild to be kid friendly."  might
have gone a long way to let you know she was serious.  Now, I don't
think that it was terribly appropriate of you to say "Bite me" to your
guild leader, and I think that response, rather than the word "bastard"
is what got you kicked out.  If she can't handle that word, the
implications behind "bite me" probably sent her into a tail spin!

   On the whole, I think this was probably a good thing for you.  Guild
leaders need to have a cool head when dealing with members, and a bit of
patience helps as well.  Seems she was short on both counts.  I doubt
that her guild will flourish in the long run.
