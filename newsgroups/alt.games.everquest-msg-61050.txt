I agree completely!

However, I'm just looking for a quick fix (read: find a recent driver for my
antediluvian card or a way to make DX8 run) and avoid buying a new card
since Santa is rumoured to be wrapping a whole new system to slip under the
tree come Christmas morning...

Anyone have an idea that could tide me over for a month?
