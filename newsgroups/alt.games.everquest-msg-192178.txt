   I was watching a little snippet about it on Tech tv the other
night.  They didn't go much in to the game play, but rather
interviewed a few players (English speaking Koreans) of the game.

   The one that sticks out in my mind was the griefer, who
described how he ganked someone and looted a uber sword.  A very
powerful weapon of magic, as he described.  The gankee took
exception to this, and demanded the sword back.  The griefer said
no, I won it fair and square.  The gankee then got a bunch of his
guildees and tracked the griefer down *in real life*.  They again
demanded the sword back, and again got refused.  They then
dragged the griefer outside and beat him into submission.  "They
were very mad, hitting me in my face and un.. here, here
(pointing to various points on  his head)".  The griefer (wisely)
gave back the sword after this display of reason.

   While there have been many times when I wished similar
resolution to some of the more aggravating circumstances in EQ,
tales of this sort don't really make me want to rush out and join
Lineage.
