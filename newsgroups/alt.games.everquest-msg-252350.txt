Well, at the end of the day, that's not your decision to make for 
anybody. Intoxication is a biological drive, same as sex and eating. 
Hell, even little children will spin around to enjoy the whoozy feeling. 
I don't know what makes you think that being passed out on the sidewalk 
from alcohol is somehow preferable to being passed on the sidewalk from 
heroin.

Maybe afterwards you'd be looking at regulating how many hours a day 
people are allowed to watch television? Certainly, the time spent 
watching it is about as productive as  being high, and probably a lot 
less fun.

If you believe that, you certainly need to do more research, at least as 
far as the USA is concerned.
