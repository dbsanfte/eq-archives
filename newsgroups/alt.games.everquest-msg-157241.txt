Your premise is flawed. There is no evidence that "customer
satisfaction is decreasing". A few whiners on class boards after a
"nerf" is par for the course. EQ is 3+ years old now, and it is
inevitable that players will cry and whine when a change affects them
negatively. There is no indication that there is mass dissatisfaction
with the current product..

I will take each point in turn.

The recent "balances" that were applied to the Wizard, Monk, Mage, and
Cleric classes addressed real problems in the game. They may not be
the right fixes, and they may be too extreme. EQ is constantly
evolving, and if certain classe/abilities/spells were "crippled" there
is a good chance that adjustments will be made. That being said the
existing game has NOT been crippled by any stretch of the imagination.

Buying the new expansion will NOT return the abilities/skills/spells
that were removed in the recent patches. So there is no incentive to
buy PoP to "return to previously accustomed levels". Again a false
premise.

Every expansion to date has "effectively isolated" players that chose
not to purchase it. You couldn't travel to Kunark, Velious or Luclin
without the expansions. You could not use the new player models, the
new Bazaar/Trader functions, level past 50, or earn AAXP abilities,
play an Iksar, play a Vah Shir, etc etc etc without the previous
expansions.

Class jealousy has always existed, and always will. This isn't
something new dreamed up to promote PoP. I don't see blood running in
the streets of Norrath, and I don't see players turning their
"dissatisfaction" against each other. There will be no backlash, and
any future products put out by Sony/VI will stand or fall on their own
merits. The sky isn't falling, and it's a safe bet that EQ will keep
on trucking until something better comes along.

>Sound familiar to you?

Sounds like you play a Mage, Monk, Wizard, or Cleric, and that you
blame the new expansion for the recent changes. Funny thing is most
objective players would agree that some type of change was required,
and that certain aspects of the above mentioned classes were out of
balance. The only point of argument is whether or not the changes put
into place were too servere or misdirected.
