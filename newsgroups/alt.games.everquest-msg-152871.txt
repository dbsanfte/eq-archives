not that fun, He was a condescending Fuck...  I am a computer tech,
and had a question about some of their memory laid out on a chart that
did not make much sense.   I waited in the LONG line to get to the
schmoe, and ask politely, I'm a little confused by your memory chart,
.. 
response with a sneer:   " Well, Its relatively simple"  as to imply
i'm a complete moron...

well even if I may be a complete moron, but as a customer he should
not be pointing that out.

that is just one example of the complete rude sorry fucking
assholeness from that store.   after the last incident, I will be
spending my dollars elsewhere... and of course telling every one I
know about my experiences.

FUCK FRY's

just had to get that out of my system.
