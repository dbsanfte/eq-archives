> where can you buy equipment online?? Characters??

Easy.

1) Buy EQ.
2) Spend time online gaining levels and plat.
3) Buy equipment online with the plat you gathered online.

EQ is an online game...you can't buy equipment anywhere
else, because they won't allow you to 'port in equipment
from MechWarrior or Doom or even Counterstrike.

They're soooo 1_4|\/|3. I know...
