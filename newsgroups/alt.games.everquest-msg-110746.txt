I hope Iksar will still be a playable race (as well as Vah Shir) (for
several reasons).

And I've heard that Kunark, Velious, and Luclin will all be removed and
"explained away".....which I think is just going to double/triple the player
density in the "original" continents...which is possibly a bad thing
(especially considering any semi-popular zones are usually camped almost all
the time.
