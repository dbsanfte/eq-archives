Why bother?  Just train and get the spells in New Tanaan.  Save yourself a
few zones.

I'm loving this, as well.  My new barbie beastlord is currently leveling in
N Ro, even though she's just to where she'll start needing constant access
to trainers (spells and all my skills coming up).  No worries, I can get
them all in Knowledge.  Ahhhhhh, the freedom.
