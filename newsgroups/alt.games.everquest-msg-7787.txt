I think you may have miss understude me.  When I said the 9 out of ten
thing, what I meant was if you see two game you've never heard of and you
just feel like blowing a few bucks, game 9 times out of ten you'll pick the
cheaper one.

Of course if you really want the game you'll pay what you have to but think
about it. I'll have to spend $15(Canadian) x 12 months which is $180.  Thats
not that bad for a really good game however add $60 on top that I really
don't think I should have to pay, that if a big factor in my disision.

I personally think lower price would in the long run make them much more,
since all most all thier profit comes from teh monthly fee's.

Also about the AOL think, AOL has been branded as junk for a reason by most
people.  If they gave the game CD in PCGamer and thousands more tried it out
the word of mouth would be huge.  The only reason I even thought about
buying the game was beacuse of word of mouth.

Its not like they are lossing money by giving it away since there is no way
to play without paying.
