No its a bigger problem than that.   I come to find out I can only not log
in while connected to Prodigy, but if I go through my other dial-up
everything is fine.  Prodigy already has policy against mp3 and other binary
newsgroups, wherein they leave out some parts of messages so you cannot get
a complete file, and now it is almost as if they are out to stop people from
tying up the lines with playing online games.  Still no answer from tech
support.

Sorry to bother you with my wonderings.  I'll try not to discuss the game in
this group again.  Blah
