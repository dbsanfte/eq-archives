    You know, finding out those XML numbers can be pretty useful. Anyone
want to know the stats of all the as-yet-undiscovered Cazic Thule tradeskill
items? ;-)

    Oh, and clerics - remember your holy symbol quests, like the Brell one
that gets you a right-click Summon Ale item? They may not have finished the
quests, but they sure did finish all the symbols right up to the "High
Priest's" symbols. And there are some nice effects on them. Hopefully with
PoP the actual quests will be implemented. I'm sure DE clerics would love
the lower-end Holy Symbol with right-click Gather Shadows (looks to be the
symbol right after the current "last" one)!
