On a side note, what loot is "unstinky" from levels 1 to 27?  The bandits
drop armor that can sell for plat and honestly you can pull two and with
that combination you should be able to handle them effectively, although
bandit camps get crowded quick...Stick to Phlargs and shiknars and you'll
get to 23 fast....remember canni is your friend.
