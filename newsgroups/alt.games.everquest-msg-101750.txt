}Exactly. And in addition to that, if people hadn't been put off nuclear

Bah, even 20 years ago, the environmentalists were right.  WE did not know 
enough about nuclear technology then, and we'd probably have had a few 
disastrous little learning experiences like Chernobyl.  And we did have a 
few disastrous learnings of our own, like the high school waste disposal 
someone cited.  Or Three Mile Island...  But no 'technophobe scaremongers' 
have managed to halt research.  A lot of research has been done, and no, 
we still don't have viable fusion reactors.  But we could make a very 
clean, efficient fusion reactor.  There still will be waste, but less and 
cleaner waste, and hopefully we've learned what to do with it.  Sure, 
solar's cleaner, and wind power's pretty good too.  I really have no idea 
why those haven't caught on more.  It seems so sensible.  Hydroelectric... 
tends to be environmentally destructive.  Where are you going to build a 
dam without wiping out the last remaining spawning environment of 
Minisculus Fishus Obscurus?

}I'm all with Greenpeace as far as the whales are concerned, but sometimes 
}I think they won't stop until we have been driven back to the Bronce Age. 

I dunno, I think the bronze age might be kinda fun, sort of like real life 
EQ with no spells! :) I'd miss my automatic flushing toilet tho.

}Anybody else noticed that their support for wind farms turned to 
}opposition as soon as they actually proved successful?

No.  Haven't really heard anyone say anything bad against wind farms... 
except 'don't they kill birds?'  Which is apparently a myth...  Wind farms 
don't seem to have any more dead birds on the ground than anywhere else.  
But I could be biased.  Some second-cousin of mine owns a wind farm...
