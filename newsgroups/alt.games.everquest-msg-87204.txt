Find yourself a Druid. 

Go hit NK- not only do beetles not run, but NK has a druid ring, a vendor, 
and a guard tower within literally 20 ticks of each other.

The best way to do it: Group wolf form(helps keep Lions from aggroing, for 
starters), Skin Like XXX, Strength YYY, and DS as needed. The lowbie pulls 
to the druids med spot, and the druid meds unless the lowbie needs a heal 
or a DS.
