Put it on 50-50 and see.  Honestly, I've done just that, and even without 
any deaths (since exp loss comes out of regular exp pool) AA bar moves 
noticably faster.  In fact, according to the numbers at 
http://eq.stratics.com/crmaps/eqexp.shtml it should move about 1.6 times 
as fast as regular exp in 60.
Last night I was doing some exp, I keep my split at 90% AA, 10% reg almost 
all of the time.  Last night I got over 10 blue of AA exp, and less than a 
single blue of regular exp.  If what you're saying is true (and EXP should 
be the same ratio, no matter what class or race), then I would have 
expected to get well over one blue of regular exp.
