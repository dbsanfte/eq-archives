Oh please. This is a game not a college degree or the nobel prize awards.
Do you really care how other people see your grand 'achievement' of
hitting level 60 in a freakin' video game? Do your really care about others
achievements?

Fine but do you really think hitting level 60 in a video game is all that great?

For me game needs 1 and only 1 requirement: It has to be FUN.
All other things are secondary. You'll forgive me if I think any
other reason for playing a 'game' is silly. Really silly.

No the reasons you see so many fuckwits and retards in quake-like games
is because you can cheat all you want in the game, its free to play, and you get
to blow shit up and cause grief to other players.

I don't see any changes so far that make it that much easier, just less if a pain in
the ass because some long standing 'features' are changed or eliminated.
