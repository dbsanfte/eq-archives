On raids the rule in our guild is:
1) Summon the pet AFTER the mob is in position, unless you have pet
hold or pet store.
2) Use pet hold or store the pet before any fight. Until the mob is in
position, don't unstore the pet or send it to attack.
3) Owner of the pet is responsible for positioning the pet, even if
that means tell it to go away and summoning another.
