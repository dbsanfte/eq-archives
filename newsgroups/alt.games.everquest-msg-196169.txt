I've watched shammies off tank mobs in POV enough times not to take this too seriously;
perhaps you wouldn't want one as MA since it seems that they don't hold aggro well at all,
but as far as standing there while things beat on them for extended periods of time (a job
I'll call "sponge" to differentiate it from the AC and Damage production of a "tank") they
seem to be more than up to the task.  Far more so than a cleric... you wouldn't catch me
trying to offtank those same mobs as a cleric unless I had DA up!

On the other hand, up thru the early 50s I used to partner up with a RL friend's ranger, and
then my cleric -would- act as MA; with stun, FoL, and Root I could generally hold aggro
against him as long as he cooperated (jolting, using slow high damage weapons, not
taunting).  The second he wanted aggro back it was his, of course... I'm not certain this
shaman can do the same thing.  On the other hand, thats many levels away yet and perhaps
there are new more annoying things shaman can do at higher levels to get the same effect.
