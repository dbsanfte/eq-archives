One part of the a.g.e FAQ is a long discussion about what's involved in
grouping, including the various roles within a group.  There's a section
that discusses, for each class, what that class tends to contribute to a
group.  (It also touches on how each class fares solo.)

Between what was there when I inherited the FAQ, and my own experiences
and those of a friend I dragged into service, I've got writeups for all
EQ1 classes except necro, rogue, and shaman.  So if you've got experience
playing one of those classes and would like to see your thoughts about
them immortalised in the FAQ, please write up a paragraph and send it to
me.  You can check the other writeups to get an idea of what's needed;
see <http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/grouping101.htm#classes>.

Don't be shy!  (As if I have to worry about that with this crowd. :-)

	-- Don.
