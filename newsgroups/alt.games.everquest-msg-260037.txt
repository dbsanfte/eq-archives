Sometimes some level of non-fun makes the fun parts even better. You
want a gamey mmorpg with fun fun fun nonstop, everything must be fun
at all times or its thrown out. Other people want a worldy mmorpg
where some elements of non-fun are used to enhance other fun, an
investment so to speak.

For the gamey mmorpg crowd, a line leading you straight to the next
quest would be a good thing, minimize that non-fun exploring and
travelling that gets in the way of the action. To the worldy mmorpg
crowd, such a thing would be an abomination leading to raw powergaming
and less sense of world.

Most mmorpgs are leaning towards gamey mmorpg right now because UO, a
worldy mmorpg, was less successful than EQ, a gamey mmorpg. However
the majority of the mmorpgs coming out right now are way further along
the gamey lines than EQ itself was, especially EQ2.

WoW is a moderate gamey mmorpg. It has a number of options that a
worldy mmorpg would appreciate, including some degree of travel and
racial differentiation/segregation etc. However there are very strong
gamey elements that tip it in gamey's favor, especially the radar and
(as far as I can tell) no ability to affect the world in any way.
