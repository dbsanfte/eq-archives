I tried two characters.

Both warriors and half-elfs. same server, Zebuxoruk.

I tried POK, West Freeport and North Qeynos with the second
character.

Only outside West Freeport does the black or gray sky happen with
the first character.

I took the same character to POK and North Qeynos, starry sky.

The other character, same settings, starry sky outside North Qeynos
and in POK.

Tried find with the second character, same sparkly thing thats
useless.
