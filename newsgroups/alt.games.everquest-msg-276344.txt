Final Fantasy you go after your first dragon at a max of 25 (You may be 
higher than that, but it will cap your level down before you do the fight)
Admittedly, he's not that bad of a dragon. With experience of what was 
up I beat him recently with one damage dealer (me) and two healers 
healing me.
Now the level 30 dragon for the Dragoon job quest... that guy is mean 
for a level 30ish party to take on.

But you can certainly give lower levels fun/exciting content. That's one 
of the best things about FFXI... the fact that the storyline is 
accessible at a relatively low level.
