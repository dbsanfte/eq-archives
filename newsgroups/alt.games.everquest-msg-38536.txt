Personally, based on the screenshots I've seen of Warcraft 3 and
Worlds of Warcraft, I think Blizzard is finally doing 3D graphics
justice. There are too many 3D games out there with no sense of style
-- EverQuest being one of them. It's good to see a developer with real
artistic talent doing something interesting with the technology
available.

According to Blizzard, the game itself is going to be more
action-oriented. I bet it'll turn out like a massively-multiplayer
Phantasy Star Online, which I think would be a great. I'm getting
tired of the 'hit-a-button-and-watch-what-happens' combat system in
all of the current PC MMORPGs. I don't like hitting a button and
letting the game calculate everything based on skill levels. I want my
reflexes to have some impact on combat. 

I think Worlds of Warcraft is going to turn out to be a different sort
of game than EverQuest. I hope that Blizzard can pull it off because
the MMORPG genre needs some fresh ideas. EverQuest is Anarchy Online
is Dark Ages of Camelot -- it's getting pretty fucking stale.
