The Guild War's thin 90 KB client is a launch program that is designed
to work with ArenaNet's

streaming technology to start and automatically update Guild Wars with
minimum input from the

player.

The launch client essentially reaches out and establishes
communication with an ArenaNet server.

Once successful communication has occurred and you have created an
account, the server examines

the Guild Wars assets on your computer, recognizes where in the game
process you are, and builds

a file manifest of exactly what assets are needed for you to play the
current version of Guild

Wars.

If you are just starting, the manifest files are generally related to
the art assets for

character creation and the initial missions. With the file manifest
determined, the prioritized

information is streamed down to your hard drive. When you have
received the initial startup

files, Guild Wars will begin running and you can head into the game
while the remaining assets

continue to stream to you in the background. Generally, by the time
you've created your first

character, your system has downloaded the content to start the first
mission, so you can

continue playing the game without seeing a load screen.

Each time you log into the game or move into a new area, the file
assets are checked against the

latest file manifest to insure that you have the most recent files.
Whenever possible, Guild

Wars will try to download the files that you need while you are
playing in another area of the

game.

Another piece of our technology that makes this streaming of
information possible is that each

file in the Guild Wars program has an individual revision identifier.
So when we make a change,

we can tag only the files necessary to create the desired change in
the game. When the program

auto-updates and checks for new content, only these specific updated
files are passed down to

you. This is in contrast to current technology that uses a simplified
file structure with a

limited revision identifier. With this system, a great deal of content
must be received and

reloaded, potentially to update just a few files.

In summary, our 90KB client file works by determining just the
specific assets you need to play

Guild Wars, providing those files to you to get you up and playing,
and then providing the rest

of the content invisibly in the background.

We should note that once you have received the files on your hard
drive you will not have to

reacquire them unless they are changed. In this way the game's
footprint on the computer will

grow as the game content grows but you will only download the
information you need once.
