Not really.

"The Universe always existed" doesn't explain its initial state
regardless of whether or not there was a 'before time started' from
any point of view.

Yes it is self evident. No argument there.

Of course, but If we make no "assumptions without evidence" about the
nature of the origin of the universe we also have *nothing* to talk
about. The whole topic is metaphysical speculation, or thought
experiments, its not cosmology.

I'm not arrogant enough to suggest that I have the right answer. To
state something with certainty when there is none would be a far
greater error.

Like we're milkmen or something. "Hi, I'm a scientist." rofl... I
should try that at work.

I'm most definately an amateur philosopher, which is the subject in
which this discussion is firmly rooted, despite your cosmological
arguments.

A lawyer? A LAWYER? I think that might be ad hominem. <g>

Gee whiz so many possible responses:
1) The faithful claim daily interaction with God.
2) Perhaps the universe is a closed bubble.
3) Perhaps being at the center of the space-time continuum isolates us
from seeing outside forces. A distant galaxy behind an impenetrable
nebula doesn't cease to exist and be relevant because you can't
currently see it or be seen from it.
4) Perhaps outside forces are relatively small. Like the weak nuclear
force to a game of billiards.
5) Perhaps our perception of time is a localized illusion. The entire
chain of causality from the beginning of time is a singularity from
the outside. Just as all the points in a line are simultaneously
digested by a viewer, perhaps all the instants of time can be
perceived in toto from a point of view instead of experienced
sequentially as we do...

Sure some of these are unsupported, some of these are unduly
complicated.  And I'm not advocating them. All I'm saying is that its
not waste of intellectual effort to conceive of them.

To simply say the universe always existed, and it started out the way
it did because thats the way it was is hardly a satisfactory
explanation for the initial state of the universe, so its reasonable
to postulate something a little more complicated than 'nothing at
all'.

There is nothing cosmological... theoretical or otherwise here. Its
metaphysics pure and simple. As soon as we look at the first cause we
really leave the realm of science. I'm not deflecting anything *into*
cosmology... im saying it doesn't apply.

Ah... yes... I'm seeking to enlighten myself. Hardly a prideful
position. But I can see how you might take it to mean that I'm
fancying myself in some ivory tower enlightening the masses. Consider
it clarified: I don't.

Miracle: 1) An event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature

What laws of nature describe the initial setup of the universe. What
laws of nature explain why it was setup like that? Creation is the
only event I can think of that science can't touch, and the best
canditate for miracle I think we've got.

Call it baloney if you like, that doesn't really support your
viewpoint.
