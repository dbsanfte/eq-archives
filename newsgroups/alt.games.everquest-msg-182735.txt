I'm missing something from your post. You say that as a cleric, you buff 
them once, and if they seem to be doing ok from that point forward, it's ok 
for you to lie and decline buff refreshes on them? If this is what you 
meant, I have to disagree. If they feel that the buff is needed, then the 
group member capable of providing it should do so. Asking for some help 
with the cost of the components would be perfectly reasonable on your part, 
but imposing your opinion that it isn't needed by refusing to cast it is 
just wrong. You're a cleric, for crying out loud. You should do what the 
group asks of you or offer a friendly farewell.

The only person in the wrong in that scenario is the one practicing deceit.
