My rubbish level 41 port bot Druid is bound in RM and I can tell you
he makes more money from ports out than he does from the odd giant he
takes forever to kill (which might drop 35 gold anyway).

With the Ranger more often than not if I'm farming Rathe seriously I'm
after the coin they drop and will leave toes, FS, research stuff etc
on the bodies even before I run out of bag room.  If I'm nearing the
boredom threshold (usually hit it at about an hour) I'm MORE than
happy to offer the 1200 or whatever gold I accumulate to anyone that
is porting out if it saves me the irritation of having to log the
Druid on or running back to PoK.
