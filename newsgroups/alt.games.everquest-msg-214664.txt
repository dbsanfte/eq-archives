The only time I ever worry about my PR/DR (which as an iksar monk start off
poor and stay poor) is when I am fighting mobs that slow nonstop.  If I just
get an occasional shaman mob that slows me, no big deal, but if I'm getting
slow cast on me 15 times a fight (FG shrooms for instance) then I'll go get
a DR buff or maybe even pull out some resist gear.

Only other time to worry about it for me is fighting raid mobs with PR/DR
AEs.  Since you're still working up to a group for LDoN, you won't likely be
facing those anytime soon.  :)
