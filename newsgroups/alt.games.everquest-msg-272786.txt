So /assist a one-shot effect, then, identical in function to actually
clicking on the mob being targeted by the player I assist? Or will it stay
in effect so that I automatically switch target if/when the assisted player
does?

I do have such a macro on a hotkey, I'm just not comfortable using it when I
don't with 100% certainty what it does :-)

A related issue:

When, on occasion, I'm backup tank, I'm supposed to pull straying mobs and
adds away from defensively weaker players. It's usually easy to see who's in
trouble by their yellow/orange/red health bars or their desperate cries for
help, but what's the quickest and safest method of targeting the mob(s)
hurting them? It can be quite impossible to tell from the 3D scene at times.

Just because a priest or a mage is being attacked doesn't necessarily mean
that he's fighting back (which would probably also be a bad idea, because of
the increased hate level), so /assist doesn't seem to be the answer here.
