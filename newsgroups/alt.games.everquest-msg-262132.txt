In which case the classes that must kite or perish simply change tactics.
I remember duoing when I was playing a druid some time ago.
I'd snare and kite while player B nuked/medded until I was low mana and/or
losing aggro.
Player B would then run circles around me while I medded nuked etc..

If a difference in speed is exists between the Mob and the NPC then kiting
is possible.
It doesnt matter who has hate or how many in the group.

Yes it is hard to find a "hunting, exploring, we are all gonna die" group..
I think that why I keep making alts that have some ability to solo.
If I don't die a few times per level I tend to stop playing as frequently.
