What's the point of selling if your not going to play on Luclin anymore?
I recently retire all my toons on Lanys to move to Tarew Marr. I looked
around & found an appropriate deserving newbie (untwinked character) and
gave away everything.

If your not intending to play on the server anymore, then its either that or
just delete everything with your character.
