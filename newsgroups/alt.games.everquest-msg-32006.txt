Hello, my name is Whittleberry. I am 30th season druid. And I'm
twinkless.

I was porting a 13th season druid from Rivervale to West Commons
yesterday. He inspected me and said happily, "Cool! We have the same
weapon!" (a velium morning star)

Today I was in Misty Thicket trying to give a newbie a 2 wis ring
after I bought myself a 7 wis ring for 400pp (leaving me with 83 pp to
my name). I asked a 4th season druid if I could inspect him. His stuff
was better than mine. Two others that I spoke with were both twinked.
I left without finding someone who needed the ring.

Yesterday I was chatting with a 35th season druid and she asked me
what my wisdom was. I said 138 (it's now 143 with the new ring). Hers
was 195. I told her I had almost 500 pp to spend on new stuff. She
laughed hysterically and said that would buy 1 piece of jewelry.

Guess it's time to bite the bullet, stop leveling and camp dear old
Dyllin Starshine. And port like crazy.

At least I can take pride in the fact that, while my equipment sucks,
my grouping abilities are excellent.
