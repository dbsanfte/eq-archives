Im slowly working my way up, and   soon hope to pass into the 40s.

I have asked a number of questions and you have all answered both quickly
and with good replies.

This question however, revolves around my new weapon,
a RUNED FROST BLADE>>>(i saved hard and long)

It replaced my vehement  sword of reihjav??

This RUNED BLADE carries a heavy weight with it and I was wondering if I
should

1. swap my AC/HP armor, for  STR gear?
2. try and obtain a few STR items?
3. obtain armor that possesses both STR and AC/HP, though I assume such gear
would carry a hefty price tag?

Please advise, and lastly,

as a Paladin, or any other class for that matter, should my armor
concentrate on AC or HP specifically?

Thanks again
