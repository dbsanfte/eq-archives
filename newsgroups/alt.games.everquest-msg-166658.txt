Odd.  Are the silks I hunt bestowed by the King?
The High Quality Cat and Bear Pelts?
If you have to work to get get an Item, the Epics are a good example, it is
the payment for working hard to get a job done.  Think of it as working hard

EQ is the true free economy.  No King or emporer sets prices or declares
only a certain number of items can be made aned sold.
