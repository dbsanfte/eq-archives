GFlux is doable to get up there, but, I would guess it's probably easier to
do the corpse drag.  Problem being, the timer for a dueled corpse is short
for rezability.  If he wouldn't mind the xp loss for a death in exchange for
getting the drop, then have him die to a mob, and then drag the corpse up,
no problems with the timer.

We have done Neh'Ashiir in the past by GFLuxing a CoTH mage up, then CoTHing
to him, so I know that is doable.

The aggro then jump method may not work.  It used to work for the Reaver
that spawns Neh, you could actually cast a collumn spell right under him,
and get him to warp down, and spawn Neh down there.  This seems to have been
fixed, and the fix could also affect Neh'Ashiir, so, not sure if that would
work or not.
