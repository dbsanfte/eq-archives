We had a Noct drop about 2 weeks ago, and no one needed it so we rolled on 
it for the hell of it.  I won it and had no idea what I had just won.

Last night, I put it on my trader and did a search on it and the prices 
that came back were between 5k and 6.5k.  I put mine at 4k and this 
morning, I'm 4k richer.  I hear they go for 2-3k on other servers, so you 
may be able to get one cheaper depending on where you are.

Yummy.  I just may BUY that SMR now.
