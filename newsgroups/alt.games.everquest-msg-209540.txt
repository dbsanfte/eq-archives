Just to voice my opinion here, I think it's lame. I've started a new
character and am having a lot of fun as the memories of my adventures
as a total newbie come back to me. But I noticed, while turning in
gnoll fangs in Qeynos, that they give one tick of EXP, instead of
leaps and bounds of it.

Why on earth would SOE do this? It ruins the appeal and the
satisfaction gained from a quest completed. Could they not have just
nerfed the EXP given from guards to solve the issue they intended to
solve without affecting others?
