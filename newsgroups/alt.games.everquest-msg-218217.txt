To a point I would agree.  It's not necessarily DPS that's the concern
but DPB (damage per battle).  Without a true healer you can line up
certain melee classes and see a large difference.

Given AC, HP's, damage mitigation and avoidance, the warrior should
outlast all other classes over the course of a battle, without a true
healer present.

A monk will outdo a warrior in DPS, but without a healer will he outdo
a warrior in DPB?
