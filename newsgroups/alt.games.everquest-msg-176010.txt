Seven Screaming Diz-Busters
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

They held their heads with laughs of pain
They learned from men who'd just refrain
From glancing at a mirror's face
Seven screaming diz-busters who lurked by a rose
Had iron for a bloodstream and ice behind their eyes

On each and all those holy nights
Where dusters dust becomes the sale and lucifer, the light

They're long so long this time of year
When stars be crossed by twirling fear
You don't suppose I'd prove surprised
Seven screaming diz-busters should go the route and die
Without the warmth they learn to crave
With hardened smiles and evil signs

On each and all those holy nights
Where dusters dust becomes the sale and lucifer, the light

Bury me near the secret cove so they'll not know the way
Bury me there, behind the rose so they'll not rile my grave
I'll not reveal whose name still loose (?)
Well their laugh of pain...And their harder smiles...
And their rigid arms...And their evil signs...
Longer days and the longer nights
And their longer, and longer still

On each and all those holy nights
Where dusters dust becomes the sale and lucifer, the light
