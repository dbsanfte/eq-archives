Dispel spells, such as cancel magic and strip enchantment, when cast by
mobs, remove spell effects at random, and have for a long long time. However
dragons and similar critters that have AE damage/dispels remove spells from
the top down.

At least that's my understanding of things. Not being particularly uber I
don't have much experience with big critters that AE damage/dispel. I do
remember Naggy or Vox dispelled that way.
