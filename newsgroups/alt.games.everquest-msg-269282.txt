I played around with these and found that they do help harvesting (just my 
own observation). For example, harvesting some herbs usually gave me 1 
success out of 3 tries. With the knife, I got 3 out of 3. Caught more fish 
with the pole, too. This is just my observation from two characters, no 
other authority.
