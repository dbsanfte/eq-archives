I will probably see those fights at some point then because my playing
pattern is such that, in most weeks, I play for an hour or so 3 days a
week and 4 or 5 hours two days a week.  I like to be able to solo for
the shorter sessions and group for the longer sessions.  I have one
elite quest in my book that I'll probably try some time next week
(after I have got at least a couple more levels).

I must admit that I have never had such a CR.  Maybe my thoughts on the
matter might have been changed if I had.

There is that - as I discussed in another message in this thread I
tried a raptor that was three levels above me several times (dieing
each time) before I got the strategy right.  I might not have done that
had I been losing 10% of a level each time.  On the other hand, last
night I tried pulling a named mob out of a group to kill him for a
quest.  The whole group came and I died but not before I killed the
named.  I deliberatley ate another death to loot the corpse for the
quest item.  I feel that that action lessened the quest and my feeling
of accomplishment at having completed it.  If the penalty had been more
then I might have approached more causiously and tried to pull the mobs
apart from the group 1 or 2 at a time to get to the corpse  (and
probably eating more deaths that way but that's not the point).
