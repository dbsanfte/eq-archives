I've learned never to assume the obvious, so I'll ask: when you entered
the /veteran command, what happened?  Did you get a message saying "You
do not have any veteran rewards claims available"?  If so, it means you
haven't been subscribed for a full year yet (and didn't sign up for the
recent year-in-advance offer, which adds a year to your subscription time
for the purposes of computing how many veteran rewards you get).

If you did not get such a message, you should have gotten a popup window
offering to activate veteran rewards on the current character.  Did you
get that window, and did you click Yes in it?  If so, you should have
gotten a bunch of messages listing the abilities being added to the toon.

If you got that far, then when you opened the AA screen, did you remember
to go to the Veterans tab in the AA window?  Were there any abilities
listed there?

As mentioned above, the one-year sub just adds an extra vet reward to
your set, and apparently also lets you get the rewards on an extra toon.
E.g., if you've been subscribed for 3.5 years you'd normally get the
first three rewards on each of three characters.  If you signed up for
the extra year, you'd get four rewards on four characters.  (At first I
thought it was four rewards but still only three characters, but that
seems to have been a bug and they fixed it.  My 1.5 years plus advance
sub got me two rewards on two characters.)
