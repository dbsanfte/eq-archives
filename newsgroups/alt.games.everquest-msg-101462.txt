Well, possibly. Not if you're in the UK, though, I hope.

Personally, I was very much disappointed that AB was located in the UK.
Holland has always been an Internet hub, at least as far back as I can
remember my transatlantic packets always went through a big fat pipe
with Amsterdam in one end and New Amsterdam in the other. All that
said, if the new server is a split server, I'm not going to move, one
move is enough for me, and hopefully the oobar crowd will jump ship to
KB, giving us a non-ubers on AB a bit of breathing room.

Rune, wondering if Lowland Elites will move =p
