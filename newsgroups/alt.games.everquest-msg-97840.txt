Ive been levelling up an enchanter, just hit 16, and this is going to make a
huge difference. Now I can see the adds myself instead of waiting for
someone to tell me.

On the con side, it means people will have less money to buy their spells
(since they got there faster). I dont see that it needs changing... its fast
enough already. whatever.

again, the existing penalties are enough. Id be happy if corpse decay times
were eliminated so its just a matter of when... afterall when a corpse rots,
the items dont rot with it.

I think verant have got it in for the druid class.

I think the idea here is to make deaths down dungeons be a possibility at
lower levels, in a drive to get dungeons into greater usage.

> f) Hell levels evened out (eliminated).

Its not the hell levels, but the double penalty for death in 36, 41,46 that
I hate. No biggie... life begins at 51. (or maybe 54 or 59)

/cheer verant
I wonder if we will see some offbeat channels pop up, such as a trading
channel, a lfg channel, maybe even a cyber channel. Pandoras box is open....

Id be happy if they just fixed the GD zone bug
