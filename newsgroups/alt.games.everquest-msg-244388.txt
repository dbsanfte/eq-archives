Every other pure melee mitigates damage better than a Monk.  Druids, Clerics
and Rangers even mitigate better than a Monk.  Monks are currently the
definition of what  Paper Tank is.  The class should be able to take hits
when landed on them better than they can now.  Monks do not have the HPs
that Warriors and Knights have so giving Monks back their mitigation at the
pre-nerf level would not mean the known tanking classes would have anything
to fear about being pushed into obsolete area of groups.  Also get rid of
the Hard Cap on AC that Monks have right now.  1340 is the magical AC number
that senior monks have concluded is the amount of AC that offered
diminishing returns if you go over.  For example a monk who had 500 AC above
1340 only saw hits doing 7 points less to himself than at 1340 AC.  With
this hard cap like I posted earlier, once 1340 is reached monks no longer
need to worry about their weight.  They can get as "fat" as they want as
long as they have enough AC on their items to stay at 1340.  Other classes
continue to benefit from AC.

Tanking is not the issue as far as being Main Tanks.  But they should take
blows as well as the other pure Melees and even finger wigglers out there.
Monks have no tools at their disposal to generate hate other than beating on
a mob.  Since they cannot keep agro then they cannot be Main Tanks of any
POP exp group.  And that should not be their role.  But, they should be what
the original developers (Prior to the new group of developers post Luclin)
had a vision of, a class that carried a ton of offense and able to avoid
being hit.
