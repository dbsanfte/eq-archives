Horses have some interesting benefits/drawbacks beyond the increased
movement speed:

Benefits:

- Faster movement outside (well, duh).
- Meditate while on horseback; this is a BIG benefit:
  - No extra aggro from sitting down
  - Meditation still happens while casting
- Greatly increased safe fall while on horseback.
- If stunned you continue moving (though you can't turn).

Drawbacks:

- More difficult to climb steep slopes (especially bad in zones
  like Mons Letalis).
- Cannot interrupt spellcasting by ducking.
- Horse disappears as soon as you zone inside (unlike SoW/JBoots
  effect which lasts for a while).  Mitigated by training Improved
  Natural Run Speed.
- Can be awkward to target mobs & corpses right in front of you.

Being able to meditate while casting Complete Heal or clicking my
Velious BP (Mark of Karn, 10 secs) & Greaves (Word of Health, 12 secs)
is a major benefit as far as I'm concerned.  Not being aggroed when
trying to sit & med is also highly agreeable.  This is outside only, of
course, but there are plenty of decent outdoor XP grinds these days.

My horse was well worth the money I paid for it, IMHO.  Don't be so
quick to scoff.
