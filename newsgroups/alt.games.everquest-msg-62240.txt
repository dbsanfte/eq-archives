Based on what?
Empherical evidence would suggest you're right.  However, no where did
I find any official statement from VI claiming this.  Infact, the ONLY
official statement I ever got from a GM-Admin was "We can only
garantee a rez within 3 hours, online or offline."

Just because timers for one thing work in a specific way, does not
neccessarily mean the other timer works the same way.
