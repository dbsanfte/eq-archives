From the shadows, the mysterious "Brian Cunningham"
<bcunningham@globeflow.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>According to the LoY site at http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/,
>Froggies and the extended bank should have gone live.
>I've not downloaded any new files yet, and I've yet to see any Froggies and
>I still have 8 slots in the bank.
>Is this a case of marketing getting ahead of itself?
