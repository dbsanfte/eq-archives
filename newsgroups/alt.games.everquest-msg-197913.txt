*sigh* To be clear: the "script" that is used to accompany RHPS varies in
different areas of the country/world. In some areas, the audience response
during the particular scene in question includes an illiterate grunt when
Rocky's face is shown on screen. It's a reference to the fact that all Rocky
does (verbally) is make the occasional illiterate grunt.

Now everyone take a deep breath and stop being so cranky. Oh, wait, this is
usenet. Never mind.
