Here's the real question: How many people in the Middle East play EQ?
EQ is based in the US, and therefore, US perspective is where the
referrence point will be to determine whether a name is offensive or
not. A name that happens to be the same or similar to a figure unknown
by most people in the US won't be judged as a bad name. Remember the
condition in the policy of "easily recognized". No, American history
is not the history of the world, but American history is the
perspective names are being viewed from.

I'd never heard of a real person named "Kahir", and have yet to run
across anybody except you who has.
