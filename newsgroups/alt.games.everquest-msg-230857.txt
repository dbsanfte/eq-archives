From the shadows, the mysterious sugarman
<sugarman@scorched-earth.org> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>So, I guess the question is, do the rest of you have some 'favorite

Walk the road in Emerald Jungle. It starts near Trak Teeth and
meanders a bit through the jungle until it reaches the entrance of
CoM. The old ruins of the Iksar city there dot the way. It's pretty
neat.

Emp room in Ssra is pretty impressive as well.
