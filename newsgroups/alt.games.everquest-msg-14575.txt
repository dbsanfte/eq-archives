Read the article on Lums.  Specificly the posts from the GM that was taken off
the Guide board.

Verant doesn't really plan on banning people.   They plan on using this to
intimidate thier customers into not making customer service calls.   Which
they apparently think will cost even less maney than "no support" mode.

They're cutting off thier fingers so they won't have to waste time clipping
thier fingernails anymore.
