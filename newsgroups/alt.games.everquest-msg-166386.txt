Here's a great one.. i'm writing my xmas list to send my parents.. what
graphics card should I put on it?  Top of the line, best out there..

I've checked lots of web sites and read statistics.  I've Come down to the
ATI Radeon 9700 Pro, or the NVidia
GeForce 4 Ti 4600.  Who has them?  Anyone seen them both run?  I may be
wrong altogether, i haven't done as much research about the ATI card as I
have about the NVidia.. honestly, i'm more partial to the GeForce line, as I
have a couple ATI cards and I don't like them very much.. but their old
cards.. Rage TNT2 Ultra's and the like.

I couldn't find any benchmark testing comparing the two of them.

Also, I've read stuff about Nvidia having a new card out, a GeForceFX or
something like that out.  Is it out, or is it just being talked about.
Anyways, let me know :)

I've got a GeForce 3 in my computer now.. when I upgraded to this thing I
was so in love.. but now it's time to replace it (got another computer who
would love the GeForce3, so I'm really upgrading two computers)
