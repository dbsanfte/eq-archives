Even better, it should be character specific. It doesn't seem like it
should be that hard to do, they already have individual character info
stored locally, they would just need a couple lists added (one for
ignore while we're at it). Or, you can try and get every friend into
the same guild, then use /who all GUILD. Some selfish bastards don't
want to drop their groups of friends to join my guild though...
