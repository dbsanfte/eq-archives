A1. I think that rangers can dual weild so you might want to think about 
getting your 1hs up. You will only get a skill up by bashing greens if it 
is a very high green and only at a very slow pace. You'll get more skill 
ups if they are blue though.

A2. Yes just to look pretty and to sell for cash to vendors.

A3. I believe that there is someone in Qeynos that sells sharpening stones 
i just cant remember where because it has been so long :D

A4. No they will disappear.
