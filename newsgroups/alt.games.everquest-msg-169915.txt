Have to agree but, I wonder if it's due to the way you play the pre 50
levels that determines how much you enjoy the post ones?
Say someone grinds their way to 50, it takes what? a month and half, from
(true) Newb up. They have now got to slow down, work on getting factions and
equipment, a  bit of farming, a few quests. They now start to look around a
bit.
Compared to someone who wandered through the zones (and levels) taking in
the sights etc...by the time they get to 50 they are a little bored with it
all and, although still having fun, no longer have the enthusiasm to do the
high level encounters, that undoubtedly take more time and effort.

There's also the fact that the high level game does seem more like just a
game compared to an RPG and the attitude to it does seem to be evidence of
this.
