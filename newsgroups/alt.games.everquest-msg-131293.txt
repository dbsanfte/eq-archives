Make sure you have the latest 4in1 drivers loaded. (4.38 I believe)

Make sure you have DX8.1 loaded

DISABLE FastWrites in the system BIOS, and set your AGP Aperture to
128mb

If you use Texture caching with EQ delete ALL *.TXC files in the EQ
directory.

My system is almost identical and EQ runs perfect for me in Win98 and
WinXP.

Athlon 1.2 (266) not OC'd
Iwill KK266
768mb PC133 SDRAM
eVGA GeForce 4 Ti4200 128mb DDR (NVidia 29.42 drivers)
Philips Acoustic Edge Sound Card
Cable Modem.
Dual Boot Win98SE/WinXP
