I'm using w2k and the latest drivers from nvidia without problems... 

dopropertinting is *awesome*. I upgraded because it didnt work with the 
last set I had which might have been 23.11, but I'm not really sure.

Basically, go find a monk or wood elf or someone in leather with a lot
of skin showing.

If their skin is tinted the colour of their BP so it looks like they have
a high collared shirt on its not working.

If it is *only* tinting certain parts of their clothing, leaving skin and
decoration like studs and straps untinted their normal colour then
dopropertinting is working; congratulations. It looks MUCH prettier.
