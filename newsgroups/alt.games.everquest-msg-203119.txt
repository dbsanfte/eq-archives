Yeah I'm the idiot, cause I have more fun having a stream of mobs to keep
fighting than to kill everything and sit for 7 or 8 minutes waiting for them
to pop.  Guess you've missed my whole point haven't ya?  Ya'll are
complaining about having to sit for so long... something I don't have to do
because I know what I'm doing.. but I'm stupid for having the fun and
cutting down my med times...  but don't do what stupid does... just keep
complaining and sitting...
