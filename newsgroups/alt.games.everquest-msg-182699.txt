>> PS I want the Mage's bet spell.   You here me there Sony??? <<

Why?

Mages need their pets. Let me state that again ... mages NEED their pets.
Mage pets will always be greater than necro pets, and they should be.

You want to see what it's like being a mage? Bring up a pet, send him after
a mob, then use your DD spells ONLY against the mob. No DOTs, no snares, you
can root the mob to simulate the earth pet, but only if the pet is still
alive. If the pet dies, you cannot use FD. Either gate or run. If you get an
add, no fear or mez.

Mage pet > necro pet ... and it should be that way. Because a mage without a
pet is NOTHING.
