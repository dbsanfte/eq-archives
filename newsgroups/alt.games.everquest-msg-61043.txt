Any

Sol B overcamped?  Sheesh.  On my server and on most I hear it is quite
silent :-).

For me personally, I had the same problem as you - DL and OT just too big,
too boring, too full of idiots.  Tried Sol B but just didn't grab me, partly
because I couldn't get a group there (because of lack of people not too many
:-) ) and partly because I had already tried Lguk and it didn't compare.  So
now at 42 I am back in Lguk where I first went at 32.

Lguk = GREAT EXP, GREAT LOOT.  You got lost and died?  What else is new?
What dungeon (and even a lot of outdoor) zones do you not get lost in and
die?  I found that the exp gain in Lguk far outweighed the amount of times I
died, and yes, I died a lot.  There are also often a lot of clerics around
(at least on my server) that will often exp rez you, most times for free
even.  It takes a while to get used to, but once you know the layout of the
place you just bring in the exp and cash.

Having said that, the first drawback of Lguk is that it a long way from a
bind point for melee good races.  The closest bank for good races is also in
NFP, and the closest merchant is in Oasis.  This means you usually end up
just throwing away an awful lot of FS weapons.  The other drawback of course
is you are a Ranger, and not necessarily suited to such a place.  Being a
Paladin, Lguk is my forte.

I could solo the undead frogloks in the hall near the zone once they were
broken at lvl 34.  I could break and solo them myself at lvl 36.  At level
40 I could solo the bedroom.  At lvl 41 soloing the ones in the hall (6 mobs
altogether) I was still making nearly a yellow bubble in an hour and a half,
even though some were light blue.  At level 42 I soloed 5 mobs at once, 3 to
start with then 2 adds that joined from a train, without using LoH.  But
even with these great solo efforts I still preferred to group over all - and
that still gives more exp than solo.

But once again, I am a Paladin, and I don't mind dungeons.  Lguk suits me
really well in that case.  But other than what you have said - OT/DL etc. in
Kunark - GD/EW/CC in Velious - and SolB/Lguk in Antonica I don't think there
are too many other decent places for loot and exp at your level.  Stonebrunt
may offer something perhaps, though I hear it is hard to get a fairly steady
income of both.  City of Mist is perhaps the other suggestion, but once
again this is a dungeon that you will need at least a partner for and is
also undead.
