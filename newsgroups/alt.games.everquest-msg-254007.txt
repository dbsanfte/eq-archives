Just started playing a Shaman, after mainly playing a druid, and pretty much
soloed myself to 16.
About to hit Pal Cav and the obvious groups.
My questions are as follows.

1.After casting any buffs on the MT and others, what is my primary role?

2. Should my first job be to assist the MT, and cast Walking Sleep, followed
by Disempower?

3. Are these the spells the same ones, all be it lesser levels, that I hear
being  something like "/g %T is slowd and tashed"??

4. If not, then what does the term Tashed, refer too?

Any other basic help would also be appeciated.

Thanks in anticipation.
