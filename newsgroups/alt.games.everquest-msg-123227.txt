Sure sounds like how people try to explain Lodizal.  I can tell you when he
spawns to the minute, without using all this "+/- 12 hours" ("I don't
actually know the spawn time") theories.

Because there is not a single other mob in the game that is on a "random"
spawn time.  I don't think Verant would devote the resources to coding that
for a single mob.

You should save this post of yours to a text file on your computer and come
back and chuckle when you find out the actual spawn time.  It's not
impossible for them to have set it up the way you say, after all it's their
game and they could program it to do just about anything, but considering
they don't use it on any other mob in the game, even after they made the
"random" first-appearance timers (which are far from random, go figure), I
doubt that they would devote the resources of programming the ability in for
just this one mob when there's little reason to.

After all, a spawn time of 41:23 sure looks random to people that have to go
to sleep sometimes.

It was to limit the number of cleric epics entering the game, while still
giving the "weaker" clerics the illusion that they actually have the chance
of beating the ubers at something by all ganging up together.  I call them
"weaker" because they don't grasp the concept that if they made that
"ganging up together" official, they would *be* the ubers.  That always
puzzled me that people don't grasp some of the *social* mechanics of the
game any better.

I can assure you, the GMs get just as many if not more petitions with the
current setup.  And ones that require more work to resolve, as it's not just
trying to intrude on a camp that's at issue, it's often an actual violation
of the rules (training, KSing, etc.).

Any guild that has the desire can put a ranger in Skyfire and have their
entire guild in Skyfire within 2 minutes of Ragefire spawning.  Figuring out
the spawn timer isn't actually *that* big of a deal considering *everybody*
can get to the zone in 2 minutes.

Sounds like someone that blamed showeq for losing a Ragefire should instead
try and figure out why they have no ranger or druid friends.  :p
