I remember reading an article about how supposedly male EQ characters
fetch more money than females on auction sites like Ebay (you can find
the article at:

http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,39020369,2136466,00.htm

The guy who did the study mentioned in the article, Edward Castronova,
said that he has played both male and female characters and found that
when he played a female, some players would assume he was less
knowledgeable about the game than when he played a male.  

On the other hand, I don't know if this stereotype holds water or not,
but I've heard of some players deliberately playing females,
especially a cute race like a High Elf or a Wood Elf, because other
players are more likely to give nice gear/plat to newbie females than
they would males.

(I found another article about the difference in the way female and
male EQ characters get treated at:
