Aye - I remember my first such encounter. Coming back on the boat from BB
to FP with 6 stacks of bone chips I had planned to turn in at Kaladim. I
forgot to turn them in. On a lark in OOT I did an /auc WTS bone chips.

As luck would have it, a necro was camping the AC and there were others
waiting in line for the camp...

Long story short, this level 8 (at the time) enchanter, for 6 stacks of
bone chips and a lot of effort (had to go all the way to FP and back again
to get there), cleared over 300p. 200p in straight cash, and a couple of
emerald rings that sold for 80p a shot. That necro -really- didn't want to
leave that camp ;-)
