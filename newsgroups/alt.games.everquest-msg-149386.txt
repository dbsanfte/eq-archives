Hey there.  Just curious if anyone else has had this problem and if so what
did you do to fix it?  I was on the other night and got kicked to desktop,
and since then if I can get in at all it is only a matter of seconds until I
am back to desktop with an error message..Any Ideas? I am about to just wipe
the drive and start over altogether. i did uninstall and reinstall all EQ
disks to no avail =(

Thanks for any tips.
