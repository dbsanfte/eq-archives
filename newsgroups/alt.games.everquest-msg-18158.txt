Sorry, no. Even if it's only pennies per piece, the R&D budgets and
the design budgets and the advertising budgets all come from
*somewhere*, and that somewhere is the price that gets charged for
each produced item.

And in the larger-run operations that you're alluding to, the *wages*
is exactly what we're talking about, regarding the craftsman being
paid in accordance with his skills.

And now you're mis-understanding me. I'm not talking about a company
that makes 100 or 1000 pieces of furniture - those kinds of numbers
don't apply to the example.

I'm talking about single, truly custom, items, made by a craftsman
skilled enough to be called an artist. This is a far better analogy to
the EQ tradeskill master than a factory pumping out assembly line
items is.

This craftsman isn't trying to recover the entire cost of his training
with each piece he makes, but the cost of the items does indeed
reflect his *skill level*. I'm not willing to pay a premium to someone
just because they own a planer and a router, but rather because
they're an expert and I expect to pay for their expertise and the
quality of the product they produce.

For most people who engage in most EQ trade skills, I'd say that's
absolutely *not* true.
