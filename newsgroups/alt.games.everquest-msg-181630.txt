Thats well known and expected though....   im sure they didn't make that
mistake.5

Anyway.. I went to SS and checked the various quest armour npcs.. they all
seemed fine except for the rogue and shaman (the 2 I was there for...)..
neither would give stage 2 of the quest (after the initial hail, that is)

Guessing the item name though, they showed the requested item/gems, and
doing the turnins was successful, at least for rogue pants and BP, and
shaman pants and bracer.  Phew!
