Yeah, actually I think it would be best to have fully random loot but
its too late for that now. Why? Well the answer is simple. If you have
totally random loot you have zero camping, farming and zero bad
behavior for which band-aid fixes like trivial combat code are made.
For example, instead of having the FBSS spawn on this one frog or
whatever in guk as a rare so its camped 24/7, why not have it be very
rare loot on appropriate level/power characters throughout all of the
old everquest? Does it make sense to you that hill giants only drop
at best 65 plat or something and an fs? They are GIANTS!

Random good loot throughout the the world would evenly disperse
players and would also make much more game world sense, why is this
one creature poping up in the same place with the same item over and
over and over again? Powerful creatures who would be successful at
getting treasure should have rare chances to drop such items instead
of them being static. Players would have no reason to que up in a more
random world or come to certain magnet zones and yell "camp check" or
"LFG" in zones with a big wait like Solb or lowerguk.
