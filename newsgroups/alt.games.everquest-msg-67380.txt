I just thought I would post a quick message about my experiences with a
Hercules Prophet 4500 (64MB) card.

This card uses the PowerVR Kyro II chipet.  You can read about it at
www.powervr.com

This card works extremely well for me in EQ with Luclin loaded.  I encounter
very little slow down.

My PC is not an uber-PC by any means:

Celeron 700
Intel 815 chipset
256MB of RAM
Kyro II
Sound Blaster Live! 5.1

Everquest runs very well.

If you're looking for a low cost card, that offers better performance than the
Geforce line of the same price (MX, etc) check this card out.
