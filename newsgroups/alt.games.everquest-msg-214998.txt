Has anyone noticed that since the LDoN Patch, that language skill ups
are coming from tells? I was in Paludal today with my Iksar and received
2 Common Language skill ups from tells. I switched to Lizardman and sent
the other person several messages and he received a skill up on them. I
have now played 4 characters to 18, and saw no language skill ups on
them except for Kjorn. He received his in a group scenario.
