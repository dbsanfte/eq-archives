As the original poster of this question. I Would just like to say thanks to
all of the contributors to the thread. I have managed to form an opinion out
of the dozens of responses. However I have really enjoyed reading as the
respondents have became more agitated, when someone suggests that a
Warrior/Paladin/Monk/Shaman *tank* is better/worse than their
Warrior/Paladin/Monk/Shaman *tank*.

People defending their beliefs with such as passion. I love it !!

I really do believe that EQ is both a reflection of life in many respects
and an alternate reality for many/most of the players.

I'm a 55 year old Englishman and recently retired, and have been playing
computer games for over 20 years, and never in that time has a game sucked
me in as much as EQ has ( bards tale on the Amiga came close)
I *really* regret not buying it when it first came out; because I couldn't
swallow having to pay to play a game I had already bought. What a twat I
was!

What I do know is that whatever characters I play I will enjoy, because EQ
is a great GAME, and its all about having fun; even if there are times when
it does stray into my *real* world....(when I go to do bed, instead of
saying to my son (who obviously plays also) "G'night and God bless"; I
say... " I'm going to bed now don't pull any MOBs".

So keep the messages flowing guys. this IS a great NG.

P.S. I changed my mind, my second character is going to be a Druid <G>
  So if anyone has any
opin........................................................ <g>
