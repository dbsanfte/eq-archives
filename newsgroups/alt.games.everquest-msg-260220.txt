I do have to say, that of all the people who go lfg in guild, rangers are 
not the ones I ever hear complaining about being unable to find groups.

Top of the list is usually Monk, Necro (they just go solo), and, for some 
odd reason, Rogue.  Personally, I take any of them that are handy, and 
only pay attention to specific classes if I know we need some particular 
role filled for where we are going.
