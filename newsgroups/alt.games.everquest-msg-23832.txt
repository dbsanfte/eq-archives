I was playing my lvl 5 human monk in BB and there was this grizzly in
there, very red to me and he was threateningly and glowered at me,
still he did not attack, go figure :)

Black wolfs also has a tendency on attacking higher leveled people
when sitting down, say at the newbie log in nektulos, seen a lvl 45
get attacked for 4 dmg(seems to be standard).
