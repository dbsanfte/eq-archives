What do I do with those different pages and words I keep finding?  Are they
useful for Necros?  Also the other gray rock looking things that have a
strange symbol on them, that also occasionally drop from the orcs in
Highpass orc spawn.  What are they for?  I've got a few of those things
(about 3 gray stone thingies and 9-10 pages) in my bank, and see a few on
vendors as well.  Are they useful for a DE Necro?  Or should I sell them to
someone other than a vendor (for a few gold)?
