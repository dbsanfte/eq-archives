In case you hadn't noticed, we're not really very worried about a Russian
attack at this point.  The Cold War is over and we're more or less friendly
with Russia.  The point of a missile defense system is to stop small missile
attacks from "rogue states".  But everyone seems to think we're paranoid for
thinking someone might do it.  Well, Islamic Extremists carry out suicide
bombings all the fucking time.  Let me put a scenario:  A group like Al
Qaeda gets a nuclear missile.  They know that we don't usually like to
slaughter innocent civilians (they don't give a flying fuck but they know
enough to realize that we do).  They figure, well, if we launch this
missile, they'll retaliate and a lot of us will die, but who cares, it's in
the name of Allah.  They figure we won't send nukes because we'll kill a
hell of a lot of innocents and we'll hurt allies of ours in the region.  So
they nuke Washington, DC and wait for the counterstrike.  Do you think
that's an impossible scenario?  I sure don't.  Not after WTC.  Hell,
wouldn't you have thought it would be extremely stupid for someone to blow
up the *World Trade Center*??  I mean, anyone with any sense would know that
we would rip their balls off for that.  And if someone like that nuked
Washington, DC, don't you think we'd be wishing we'd had the sense to keep
our missile defense system up?  Because the system we have right now could
stop a few missiles.  It couldn't stop a massive strike, but then no rogue
state that we know of really has massive numbers of nukes.  Now, of course,
if we have a system that can stop a nuke, they may not be willing to try it
because they'd realize it probably wouldn't get through.  Which, of course,
is all the more reason we should keep the system active.

How does a missile defense system qualify as shoring it up with dynamite?
Are you suggesting our defense systems will rebel and kill us all like in
Terminator... lol
