You don't need to fight blues to get spell skills to go up.  In fact,
you don't need to fight anything.  For DD spells, you can target a
green mob, a mob's corpse, or a player's corpse, and cast on that.

You can always go back and learn them.  There's nothing that will stop
you at 22, for example, from going out and memming only spells of
level 14 and under and pretending you have 120 less hitpoints than you
really do (you can even nuke yourself down to a level 14's hitpoints
if you want :-)), and then fighting mobs a level 14 would fight, until
you are comfortable with the tactics.

It's melee skills that are the problem with PLing (although that can
be dealt with...many a guild that has needed a specific class, such as
a monk to pull, has PLed from 1 to high 50's in a few days /played,
with high or maxed skills).

I'm not saying I'd recommend this, however, since it appears that you
don't have any other characters much higher than the one that would
get PLed.  PL now and then when you hit a rut.  You get new spells
every 5 levels.  You'll come to points where you've figured out how to
use your spells effectively, and you've figured out the strategies for
the mobs you can fight, and it feels like you are just grinding along
to get to the next spell level...that's when you want a little PLing.
