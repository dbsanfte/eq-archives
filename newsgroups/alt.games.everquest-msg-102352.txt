Verant put a limit on how much you can patch.  When there were no limits,
people who think bandwidth is free (e.g., cable modem users) were abusing the
patcher.  E.g., if they needed to reinstall EQ or install it on a new machine,
they would just install the patcher (about 200k), and then let the patcher
download all the rest.

Bandwidth isn't free...a downloaded EQ install costs Verant around $1-$5,
depending on just how good a deal they got on bandwidth, so Verant put a stop
to this.
