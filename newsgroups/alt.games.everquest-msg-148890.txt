I don't like enchanters that gate when their mez is resisted. >:-(
Especially when I (the ranger) ghetto mez by rooting both mobs
*before* they gate and they gate anyways. Panicky players are
dangerous to everyone around them.

On a related note, I don't like clerics who gate for no apparent
reason whatsoever. It was a very powerful group, was obliterating
upper dogs in Velks with no trouble at all, constant pulls, good exp,
and she gated without a word and /q. No reason. Couldn't have been the
people, no one was saying anything controversial. The group was
powerful enough that we continued wiping them out without any healing
besides a paladin, so it wasn't as if she was in any danger. It must
have been a rl emergency, but if you have time to gate you have time
to at least say 'emergency gotta go sorry'.

Okay so it wasn't as short as originally expected. But still pretty
short.
