A dozen 56+ clerics...
I can't remember the time we had more than 9 clerics at any raid.  And
anything over 6 clerics is far too much healing.  Fuck me, I don't
think we even HAVE 12 clerics on our roster.

Tunare isn't a mob where you need obscene healing power.  Tunare is a
mob where you need obscene damage output.  You can have 50 clerics, if
you can't generate the damage to overwhelm her regen, you ain't
killing her.

Tunare's damage output compared to most mobs of her calibre is
actually low.

In otherwords, I SERIOUSLY doubt they would have killed Tunare even
with the Donal's BP if they can't do it now.

As long as you can control aggro, YOU DON'T NEED DONAL'S BP!!!

What part of this is hard to understand?

What the hell does that have to do with anything?

And a fairly stupid one.
We tried this with Velketor very early in the days of Velious.  You
know what happens?  People LD, people lag, people get tossed by that
gravity flux and is interrupted.

When your healing chain is 12 deep, you have 12 links which can be
broken.  It's a fuckload easier to find 6 people with stable
connection and won't LD at the drop of a hat than it is to find 12
people who won't LD at the first AoE.

We tried it against Velk about three or four times.  Each time, the
chain broke because it was too long.  At the end, we said screw the
donals and halved the healing chain.  Dead giant, all clerics at 40%
mana.
