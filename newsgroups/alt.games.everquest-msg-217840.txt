I got it from Allakhazam, and the writeup was certainly complete enough for 
me to do the quest based on it.

As I recall, kill Dylin (or something like that) in HHP.  He is in the 
hidden area you get to by swimming underwater up into a cave.  You get one 
of the two drops from him.  The other you get by giving 2 gold (?) to 
someone in Qeynos.  I can't access allakhazam from here, so I can't verify 
names and such.
