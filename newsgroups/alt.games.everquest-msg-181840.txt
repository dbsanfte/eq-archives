Unless heavily twinked, both would be a challenge to solo efficiently.
The Monk would suffer the worst (recent nerfing has really hurt the
"tankability" of the class). The SK will be forced to rely on
fear-kiting which will limit hunting to outdoor zones with predictable
pathing.

Mage
Beastlord (Monk/Shaman combo-pet class)
Shaman
Druid

One change may not have heard about is the elimination of a pet taking
most of the exp. As long as you do at least 1pt of damage you get all
of the exp when using a pet.
