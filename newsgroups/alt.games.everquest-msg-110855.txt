Society is a huge thing, you can't just say it's going up or down, and
expect that to be distributed across the whole.

Look at the way the media treats christianity, it's not exactly even-handed.

"Hateful"????  You mean those nasty conservatives who freed the slaves, and
who passed the Civil Rights laws?  You mean like Attorney General Ashcroft,
who was considered to be a champion of civil rights by even the liberals,
until he was nominated to that post?  Please, you slander a good man with
your statements.  Ted Kennedy tried to pin "racism" on him, when that didn't
work, he tried "racial insensitivity" (MLK himself would have a hard time
disproving such a vague term).  And it all comes down to the fact that he
didn't hire a minority who was unqualified for the job.  Sorry, but the
major media outlets pulled a big one with this.

So, being christian automatically disqualifies one for office.  Sounds like
prejudice here.  Some how I don't think that's what you're saying, but it is
what the arguments against Ashcroft boiled down to.

Remember that Christ was also the god of the Old Testament.  There is a time
for New Testament views, and a time for Old Testiment views (Turn, turn,
turn).

Then you probably have very little understanding of conservatism and
christianity.
