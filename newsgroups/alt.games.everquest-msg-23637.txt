I've been using zombie skins because they *stack*. I can get puma skins
and black wolf skins off of the merchants in the Commonlands for less than
3pp per 20, not to mention that they are much easier to obtain (not just
in the Commons, but pretty much every lowbie zone.) When they start
stacking on the player servers, I will most certianly start using them.

My rogue is working to grandmaster pottery. Not only is it cheaper to make
your own vials, but (supposedly) idols are only the beginning of a pottery
renaissance.
