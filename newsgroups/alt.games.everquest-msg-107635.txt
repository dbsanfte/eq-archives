You need to make sure that you have a constant Defense skill level for the
level. If the skill is increasing as you're looking at the test data then
you don't have an accurate look at how AC is affecting the results because
it is rising over time. This is my main problem with your L1 test, you
didn't let Defense get to max before getting data.

Therefore, Celaeno's suggestion of bringing your level up to four with bone
chips is not a good idea because you will still have the variable AC thing
going on. When performing a test, you want to reduce the number of
variables, if you could get to level 4 with 0 defense and keep the defense
at 0, then it would be a good idea. But there is no way to keep defense at 0
if you're testing how often you get hit.

What I would like to see is how often a warrior gets hit compared to a
caster with identical level and AC. Can you try to create and twink a
non-tank so that it has the same AC as the warrior and see how the results
compare?

Other than the issues I've already pointed out and the level range issues
that some others have brought up, this looks pretty good. It seems all you
were going for here was a "proof of concept", therefore you wouldn't need
such a wide range of levels because they would be covered in the later
phases of the study. Just remember to reduce variables, you want everything
to remain constant unless you change it yourself and don't change more than
one thing at a time.
