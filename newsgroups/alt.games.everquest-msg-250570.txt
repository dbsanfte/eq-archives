...is that it is entirely self contained. I just picked up a mobile HDD and
external USB2 enclosure yesterday, copied my entire EQ folder over to the EQ
HDD and was able to plug in successfully at work today playing directly off
the USB HDD to check my vendor.

We aren't allowed to put games on the PC's at work of course, but then I am
not doing that am I?

*cheesy grin*

PS - zoning was a bit slower of course when you consider a 5200rpm HDD
compared to a 7200rpm Raid 0 setup at home, but it was still perfectly
playable.
