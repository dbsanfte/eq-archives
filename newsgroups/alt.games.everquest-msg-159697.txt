I think Ben has the right idea about CB being is similar to a dugeon. With
many dungeons there is only one way out, so the deeper you crawl the more
you risk in trying to get back out.  CB has only one entrance/exit, and
deeper delving does result in a nastier array of mobs an risk.

Running out usually involves a "train to zone... move it or lose it" type
escape route.
