Yet another "if you don't live your life like I do then you're the 
screwup" post.

If EQ allows him and his family to spend time together and enjoy a hobby

together. I imagine quite a few EQ players sit alone in a dark room 
playing by themselves while their parents are totally oblivious to what 
their child is doing all night.
