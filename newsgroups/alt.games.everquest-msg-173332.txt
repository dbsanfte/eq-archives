Make a hotkey for /corpse.  Target yourself.  Run toward the corpse, hitting
your /corpse hotkey rapidly.  As soon as you see that it worked, instead of
telling you that the corpse is too far away to summon, turn and run away,
still hitting the /corpse key rapidly.  You'll drag the corpse away from the
danger spot.  After a few seconds of this, you can stop hitting the /corpse
key and switch to strafe-running to get away from the mobs that are chasing
you.
