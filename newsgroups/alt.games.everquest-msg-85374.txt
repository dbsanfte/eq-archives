My level 30 Vah Shir shaman went through Highpass for the first time
a few days ago. I figured what the hell, I'll take a look up there.
I was shocked to find ol' Dyllin standing under his tent without a soul 
around save his smuggler pals. There were about a dozen players in the 
zone, too. Unfortunately for me, this was the Firiona Vie server, where 
TLC is in force everywhere, and Dyllin conned green.

Just goes to show that you can get lucky. And it can happen on 'normal'
servers too. My wife's shaman found Dyllin standing there on the Tunare
server long ago...dropped him and got the page, at which time a juvenile
dr00d came running out of nowhere and accused her of stealing his camp -- 
apparently he had fallen asleep at the keyboard and the sounds of combat 
woke him up -- unsuccessfully tried to train smugglers on her then ported 
all across Norrath /shouting about how she "KSed" Dyllin from him. 
I wish I could remember that numbnut's name...
