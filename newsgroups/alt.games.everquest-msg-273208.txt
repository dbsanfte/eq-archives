Sorry, I didn't know there were two games.  The CD I have says
"Everquest: Neverwinter Nights".  I therefore assume it is EQ?

This is on the Mac, if that makes any difference.

I have a Paladin. I completed the training portion or the tutorial, then
met with Arabeth (I think that was her name -- the princess in the south
room).  When meeting her, we were attacked by 4 bad guys.  It seemed
that the others in the room did most of the killing, though I got a blow
or two in.

After that intro battle, Arabeth took me aside, gave me a key and said
to free the four creatures in the room at the other end of the palace.
I found them, after a few "weak goblin" encounters and am standing in
front of one of four locked doors, each with an odd looking creature
behind them.  There are no NPCs around -- they were all killed in the
training room where I finished off the goblins (dead before I got
there).

I actually bought this game about a year ago, but am just now getting
around to trying it, after reading so much about how good it is.  I have
the CDs (I have a good filing system for those), but have no idea where
the manual is (scattered among literally hundreds of such manuals).  I
was hoping the tutorial would be sufficient, but maybe I need to buy a
guide book or some such?
