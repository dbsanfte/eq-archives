Almost all my kids are women:

Skila, 54 ranger
Jennaii 44 druid
Linni 29 shaman
Healea 29 cleric
Spookiti 29 beastlord

Then I have Stormfoot, male warrior barbarian - Tribunal.
Level 13.  Twinked, pretty heavily.  I'm going to have to re-roll him, I just
can't do the guy thing well. Besides which, women can be worthy warriors too. 
I date men.  I don't want to BE one :)
