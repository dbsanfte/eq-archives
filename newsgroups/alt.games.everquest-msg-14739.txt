Took me 3 weeks to get my test character to level 10, and so far now 3 1/2
weeks to get this warrior till 26.  Think I am learning the game a bit. ;)
I do plan to play an Iksar Shaman next so I probably won't be able to use
what I've learned to level quickly considering he is KOS in most of the
great spots I have found.

I do not understand all the crazyness over LOIO and Sarnak Fort.  The exp
dries out fast in the mid-20s and the loot is subpar.  I have found spire
groups in SK and the WR room in Highkeep to be far superior hunting spots
for my level.  Why is LOIO so popular (not counting the areas for lower
level players)?  Although, I do see Spire and Highkeep do indeed have
limited room for many players.
