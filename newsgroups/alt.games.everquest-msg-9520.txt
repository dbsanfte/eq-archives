I don't think the point is that higher level chars have no right to hunt
lower level mobs for supplies, loot or just for yuks.  The point is that
a higher level char wiping out a lower level hunting ground so that the
folks who want to hunt there for exp along with their supplies, loot and
yuks are forced out might want to think about being more considerate to
the lower level chars.  There is no rule that says you have to be
considerate of others really, its just sort of the nice thing to do. 
Some folks are pure bastards though, so none of that sort of silliness
applies to them since "because I can" is their mantra.  

So bottom line... tradecraftsmen <> bad, questors <> bad, faction
raisers <> bad, researchers <> bad, bastards = bad.
