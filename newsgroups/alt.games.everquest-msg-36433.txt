Are you trying to max the skill out with sheer practice immediately after
gaining a level or are you raising skill while hunting?

In my experience, its much easier to raise skills while hunting (with a few
notable exeptions, such as evocation for a necromancer, or swimming for
anyone), the time seems to pass faster, and you still get the skill maxed
out before your next level (unless it's a recently acquired (sp?) skill,
such as disarm for warriors at 35 or something similar, where you have a
VERY large gap to cover between current and max skill).

At least you aren't doing trade skills, where not only does it seem to take
forever to raise, but it drains your bank account dry while you're at it. =P
(naah, seriously, trade skills rock!)
