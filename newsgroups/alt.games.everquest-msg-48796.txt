Not quite right. Strength is a factor (a pretty small one) in your success. Only
the higher of WIS or INT determines your chance of skill ups, with a floor of 70.
(ie if your character has 65 WIS and 60 INT, 70 will be used.)

After much obfustication, Verant did announce a few months ago (via unofficial
means, ie by way of VI's chief tradeskills designer talking to the webmistress of
EQTraders) what role strength has for smithing, and also admitted that dex has the
same role for pottery, tailoring and jewelry making. Of course, they could be
lying out their asses; it would not be the first time.

The general rule of thumb used by the Povar-Tarew Artisans on Xev is: when you are
skilling up, you should favor items that increase your WIS/INT, and that if your
base stats for both are the same, go with INT (generally less expensive, easier to
get ahold of and less likely to be class restricted. Can you say, 'Stein of
Mogguk'?) If you are making something that is already trivial for profit, get
every piece you can that offers the secondary stat for your skill. For a warrior
smith, you would want to wear crafted bracers (with +3 INT each) and gold sapphire
earrings (2 STR, 4 INT each) while skilling up and switch to, say, gold fire
emerald bracelets (with 5 STR each) and electrum sapphire earrings (4 STR, 2 INT
each) when making something trivial for profit.
