    Here is your mistake. If you're talking about a necro Darkness-line
snare, which does damage and snares, then with your 50% increase made-up
numbers you'd have:

    Snare with EA lasts 90 seconds, doing 6 damage every 10 seconds.

    Regular snares, like druid snares, do no damage and are unaffected by
both EA and BA.

> Snare with BA lasts 60 seconds, doing 9 damage every 10 seconds.

    So now you see the "nerf". Same damage, but on Darkness I'm more
concerned with duration than damage.
