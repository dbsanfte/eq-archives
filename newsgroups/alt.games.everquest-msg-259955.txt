I don't think you're being quite fair here.

Some people's brains are wired different.  There's an actual physical
difference in the way their brains are designed that make them easily
addicted to things.  Their brains treat these things like we treat
oxygen: They MUST have it.

Saying "just stop" is an oversimplification (and to many people who
suffer from addiction it's offensive).  For many things, willpower is
simply not enough.  They need help, and lots of it.  That help might
come in the form of talk therapy alone, or it might also involve
prescription drugs.  It can be a hard battle.

It's not a black or white thing, either; it's more like shades of
gray.  Some people just plain don't get addicted to things.  Some
people get mildly addicted to things.  Some people get moderately
addicted to things.  Some people get horribly addicted to things.
Many of them are at the mercy of the way their brains are wired.

All right, all right, I'm not a psychiatrist, my aunt is, and this is
the layman's understanding she gave me.

You're ENTIRELY wrong here.  People who KNOW about addiction KNOW how
to build things for maximum addiction (I'm talking psychological
addiction here, not physical).  My aunt, a psychiatrist, has allowed
me to peruse books that discuss exactly what qualities of things like
gambling make it addictive, and I could easily see how EverQuest has
many of those same qualities.

Now, the question is, did they make EverQuest addictive on purpose?
Who knows...

I think I've already adequately shown this is incorrect.

And when you discover WHY you want the expansion bad enough to
pre-order it knowing fully well from SOE's prior history that it
probably won't go well but do it anyway, you'll BEGIN to understand
addiction.

This is something I can't force you to research, though; you'll have
to do it yourself.
