Probably won't but thought I'd at least gather some opinions first.
So, my partner and I explored a bit in Jaggedpine last night, until early
this morning. Found one easy quest (easy, since my buddy can 'port us to
Butcherblock and Surefall) and completed it. while going through our
inventories and seeing what could be sold or destroyed, a couple of very
aggressive mobs (water sirens? potameids??) were trained to the ZI / ZO gem
right next to 'Fortress Jaggedpine'. Lag was already prety bad here, and
having to react quickly wan't an option. My buddy made it three steps to the
gem before he dropped (wimpy druid) and I flat out went LD from the lag.
Came back on to discover someone had TL'd me to bind-point and took my stuff
(/em removes tongue from cheek).

So, is this something I should ask for a CS Ress over (because of laggy
conditions in a new zone, and real small target for zoneout), or should I
just pay for what I can get from a passing cleric/paladin? I really would
like some of that XP back, as we are both in danger of DONG-ing with one
more death.
As an aside, any suggestions for hunting spots for a 52nd Warrior and a 45th
Druid? SW corner of  IC is safe enough, but the XP trickles, and I'm up to
my armpits in Ulthork armor.  We both have all current expansions, but would
prefer someplace not so graphic heavy, since his PC is a 'barely-runner'
(AMD K6/400, 16 Meg 3DfX video, 128 Meg RAM).

Thanks for any and all opinions.
