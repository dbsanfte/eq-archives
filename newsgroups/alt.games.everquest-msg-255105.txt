No it's not, it's exactly the opposite.
When you don't pay you get less FPS on background sessions thus obviously
resulting in less cpu usage. When you do pay you get *more* FPS on
background sessions while *still* using less cpu time.

FPS = render speed. Obviously it has to do with the discussion, just that
you're making a difference between the two when there isn't one.

Oh.. my.. god. You really don't have a clue do you. Setting the background
max FPS to 10 or lower does *exactly* that. The only thing you need to pay
for is having *HIGH* background FPS while still having *LOWER* cpu usage.
Which is only useful for multiboxing, since higher FPS correspond to higher
responsiveness while autofollowing.

It's funny though. I'm sitting here, typing this, while my cpu usage meter
sits around 20%. This is with Everquest running on the background, in
bazaar. It's exactly what Moopy and so many others want, and it's achievable
without paying.
