On Fri, 08 Feb 2002 23:58:01 GMT, rutzroop@hotmail.com (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

This sounds like normal everyday EQ life to me.

They were probably wondering why you didn't just pull from deeper in
if neither of you was emptying the area of spawns. I don't detect any
real attiude there.

I am fanatical about defending what I am camping. An unbroken
campground, though, is fair game unless someone is obviously getting
prepared to break it, and a hiding rogue doesn't qualify.

No, and you are way too nice to be a druid. Do all of us a favor and
help put a stop to the idea that WE are there to port THEM around and
THEIR convenience.

Depending on the language used my response to an unsolicited,
unwelcome port request ranges from "sorry, busy", to "it's two zones
away, walk for god's sake", to just outright ignoring them. If I don't
feel like porting, though... I DON'T.

I don't feel guilty at all about declining people ports. I played a
warrior myself to the endgame, with no jboots or anything. I walked
when I wanted to go somewhere. Got the dreadlands to sebilis route
down pat rather than whine for a druid or wizard to port me to emerald
jungle.

Anyone who would be miffed by being declined a port is not worth
keeping faction with anyways.
