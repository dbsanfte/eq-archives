That is correct, the buff even fades if you are not close enough to the 
grouped player.  It's similar to a bard song.  As long as you are close the 
buff benefits you, when you leave a group or move too far away the buff is 
gone.

The buff range is pretty good though, you won't be loosing buffs while 
fighting mobs, unless you are spread out looking for specific mobs or 
something.
