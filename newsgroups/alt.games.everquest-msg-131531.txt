}No.  Guides cannot check reports.  This guide had absolutely no way of 
}knowing what the other person said.

And actually, This might be a very good time for you to review how report 
works... it sends the last ten lines starting at the bottom of your chat 
window when you send the command.  So you have to scroll to whatever the 
offensive comment is.  I know it says it sent last 10 lines concerning 
xxx, whre xxx is the name you /reported, but that -doesn't- mean it sent 
the last 10 lines that have the string 'xxx' in them or anything vaguely 
useful like that.

The reason for this reminder is that I would rather expect the guide to 
behave like that if he'd already talked to the GM and the GM said "uhhh... 
I don't see anything incriminating in this report..."
