Yes indeed, in many a raid, you'll see all clerics locked into a
CHeal chain on the MA, and relying on druids, shamen, and heck,
even paladins, rangers, necromancers to keep alive anyone else
(including clerics)

While clerics may be the best healers, they are often too busy to
heal people who don't require the best heals.
