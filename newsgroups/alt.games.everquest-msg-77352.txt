I started doing that when I was fighting inside the sarnak fort, but not 
actually IN the fort.  With all the groups there looking for mobs, I 
couldn't let one wandering by get away, now, could I? =)

I make sure my group is comfortable with me doing that, assuming I have the 
mana to handle the mob, keep up my haste / slow duties, etc.  If they 
aren't comfortable with it right off the bat, I slowly get them comfortable 
with it until they expect another mob there waiting when the last one dies.

I do it a lot more in OT now that you have to be relatively close to the 
mob when it dies to get EXP.  Instead of the puller leaving early to get 
the next mob, I will try to have one waiting.
