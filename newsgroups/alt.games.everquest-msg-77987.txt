True.  There's also the fact that they cannot exactly be enforced.  I'd love
to hear the laughter at my ISP when people start demanding that my account
be cancled for top posting.  Somehow, I doubt widomaker would have to worry

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
