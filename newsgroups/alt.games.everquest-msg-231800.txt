I am not disagreeing with you.  The only thing Broadband did for me was help
me zone faster.  My point is that if future games are designed with
Broadband players as the norm then the server-side info could possibly be
modified to take advantage of this faster pipeline.  I am not sure how EQ
does it but when I played DAoC some people hacked their game so that the
DAoC server they played on thought they had a slower connection then they
really had.  This had the effect of super speed travel for the players
because the server is faked into believing you are running behind a slower
connection and makes compensations.  They did this so that a person on
dial-up who was moving along with someone on broadband should travel the
land at nearly the same speed if both have the same buffs or are just
running normal.

It would be interesting to compare the data that is sent between an EQ
server and dialup client; and an EQ server and broadband client.  Both
players would need to be grouped together and doing nearly the same things.
I bet they would be nearly the same as opposed to the broadband player
getting a ton more updates which I believe would cut down on much of the lag
in densely populated areas.  For example, with a Raid of 40 characters, the
client could receive 10 updates a second about each of the players instead
of only 5.

Of course I could be totally wrong.
