    Yup the LFG feature would be top of my list of the good changes - it
makes the lesser used zones more likely to be used IMO.

    BUT the biggest excitement in ykesha for me is that I don't have to buy
it if I don't want it... and ill be buggered if ill pay for that. The bank
and the LFG features are gameplay fixes, almost bugfixes that should've been
provided in any old patch, and the content..... theres a lot of places i
havent seen yet so i dont really need more content... having to pay for the
expansion just to get the spells (Seriously how much work is coding new
spells? Give me a fucking break) is a load of bullshit, but then the new
spells don't justify the outlay, so screw it. :)

Cheers,
James
