I don't know, maybe because each instance of Antonica or Commonlands
has, on average, a few hundred players?  Kind of hard to get in a
single player game, don't you think?  There are a few group-instanced
zones, but most instanced zones in EQ2 are instanced to solve the
problem of overpopulation, not to remove interaction with others.
