I have been spending a lot of time in the Plane of Hate, trying to get the 
Shattered Gem of Corruption for a Ranger in my guild.  After spending about 
40 hours, over three weekends, and about an hour a day during the week, I 
have not seen ONE drop off of the mini-bosses that i have killed, and that 
is quite a few.   I read somewhere that Sony supposedly increased the drop 
rate on that item, but I haven't seen any evidence of that.

Anyone have any ideas on what to do to get this one damned emerald?
