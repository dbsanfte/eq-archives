Okies...maybe silly question, but here goes.

In looking at Class armor (IE: Rangers have the Ivy Etched Armor, Warriors
have Berserker? armor), what is the applicable armor for Druids?

I've been wearing Tizmak and studded for quite some time now, and would like
to upgrade.  I've seen a lot of the druids in full black armor, but haven't
found out what that is yet.

May be a tad vain, but I'm also sick of looking at the armor graphic for my
half-elf druid.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank You,
