It sounds like you are missing something.
The only time that a high level char in a group does not get xp while a
lower lvel one does is if the mob killed is Green to the high level and
not green to the low level char.

I think that you have forgotten that the 5 level limit works both ways
so that you can actually group with someone level 4 (you are 9). 

Regarding PLing. 
Mostly this is done without grouping.
Eg My 60th Druid buffs you lots and then you solo Red to you Mobs, but
we are not grouped.
Or My Cleric heals you constantly. While we are not grouped.

HTH,

Jim
