According to the rumor, anyway. And the rumor tells only one side of
the story. While I guess it's entirely possible someone did get banned
somewhere in a chain of events that included demonstrating a dupe bug
to a GM, I doubt that was all there was to it. I wouldn't be surprised
if that person laid out in detail to as many people as possible how to
work the bug before demonstrating it to the GM... That, or he got
hostile and offensive when the GM didn't give him any/good enough
reward for reporting it. I seriously doubt demonstrating the bug was
what got him banned. Verant aren't *THAT* stupid.
