Yup, that's what he is, a giant tadpole.  This sort of thing is done quite 
often in EQ.  For example, the huge Golems in the Overthere Outpost are 
merely extremely large Mudmen from The Gorge Of King Xorbb.  And check out 
the Fae Drakes in Lesser Fay sometime to see a dragon about an inch long.

I get the impression that Muglwump is designed so that players in their 
teens can have an experience like a dragon raid.  It might be amusing for a 
guild with a bunch of 55+ players to get together, make some lowbie 
characters, and see how low they can be and still bring down Muglwump...
