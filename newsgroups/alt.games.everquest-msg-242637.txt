I would say generally the best advise is to buy your 50+ spells in the
bazaar.  Not everything will be available, but most spells will on sale for
a good price.  The scroll and the turn-in components for the LoY spell are
all probably No Drop, so if you want that one you'll have to keep killing
mobs until you get turn-in drops that you need.
