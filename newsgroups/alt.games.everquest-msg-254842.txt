At lvl 55 after buffing myself the only offensive spells I use are 3 Stuns
and Root (Instill).

Force of Akera
Force
Holy Might

I have a hot key that casts whichever is ready to go.  If it's a non-casting
mob, I use them once every 10 seconds to keep aggro, if it's a casting mob I
use them non-stop.  No beasts gating, or healing themselves when I'm around.
