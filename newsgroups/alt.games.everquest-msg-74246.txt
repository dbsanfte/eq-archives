I don't think they want travel to be *that* easy.  However, it might
be reasonable to do half of that.  Make it so that there are several
more ports out of the Nexus, but don't add any more ways back to the
Nexus.

Players could also make a simple change to play style to make it
easier to find groups.  Right now, the typical way people play is that
when they are getting ready to log out, they leave their group, and go
do any selling and buying they need to do, then either log in a city
or auction area, or travel back to where they expect to start looking
for a group the next time they play.  When they log back in, they are
ready to kill, and immediately head out to the zones they want to
group in to start looking for a group.

A simple change in order would help.  When you finish a play session,
do NOT run to a city or auction zone.  Camp out where you are.  When
you log in for the next play session, *start* by going to the city or
auction zone to deal with disposing the loot from the previous
session.  After you've dealt with that, you can then go look for a
group.

How does this help?  This simple change would change the cities from
places that are full of people who are about to log out to places that
are full of people who are going to go out and adventure as soon as
they finish their business in the city.  Cities and auction zones
would become good places to form groups.
