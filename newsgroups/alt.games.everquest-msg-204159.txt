Really? I've always kept a dedicated main inventory slot (the only one
that doesn't have a pack) and a spot on my (overcrowded) main hotkey
bank for the boots. The fact that I didn't get run3 until I hit 60
might have something to do with it but I consider an inventory useable
insta-click SoW as incredibly useful.
