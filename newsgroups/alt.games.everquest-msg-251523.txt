This is why the solo LDoN adventure is going to take so long to implement.
They've spent the last 2 years trying to hamstring classes so that they need
each other.

It's not impossible.  For eample, place healer NPCs at various points along
the way for the rogue, or give the rogue a mission that plays into their
class specific abilities (lots of hiding and sneaking in a mission that
requires you to steal something and return it for a certain amount of XP in
addition to the points).

But it will take time to develop.
