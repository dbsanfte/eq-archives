I had sent in the idea of safety deposit boxes.  Where you could leave an
item for someone, give them the combination in a tell or leave a note like
you suggested, then let them go open that box and get the item.  Sure beats
dropping stuff on the ground for transfers to yourself.  How cool would it
be if you could mail that item to their hometown post office.  With just one
item, it's not like it would change the world, but it would sure be a great
convenience.  I can get a message to someone in Afghanistan right now if I
pay enough, so why wouldn't it be realistic to say a message or item could
be sent to a DE from a Barbarian if the price wasn't right?

I'm guessing they couldn't think of a way to include bugs in it, so they are
still working on it.  Just kidding VI, all things considered, great job.

Bill
