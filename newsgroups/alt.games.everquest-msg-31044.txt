    OK, so halfling cleric (low STR), less than 500 plat (spells cost), some
hunting suggestions OK. Hey, ho, let's go!

>Ears: Forest Loops (2): +2 AC, +3 AGI, +3 DEX, +3 WIS, Wt.0.1

    Look for Electrum Black Sapphire earrings. At your level they have the
same AC (less the 1 AC from the AGI), more total mana, and a LARGE number of
HPs - 70 for the pair. At today's prices should almost swap even for the
Loops - talk to a jeweler in EC to see if they'd consider the trade.

>Neck: Black Iron Medallion: +3 WIS, +3 INT, Wt. 0.1
>Possibly quest for: Black Alloy Medallion: +6 AC, +5 WIS, +5 INT, Wt. 0.1

    Very solid, could be camped with friends. Could also go after a
Chrysoberyl Talisman, from the Minotaur Patriarch in Lower Guk: AC 5 WIS 3
MANA 20. Again, at your level more total mana, and if you decide to buy it
it'll be cheaper than the Black Alloy Medallion.

>Face: Velium Ruby Veil: +8 STR, +8 WIS, Wt. 0.1
>
>Head: Savant's Cap: +2 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Wt. 0.3

    I'd suggest purchasing a Skull-Shaped Barbute. AC 13 HP 35 Sv. Magic 10.
Usually 100 plat or less, which is exceptional for stats like that. That one
piece makes up for a LOT of WIS gear elsewhere.

>Right ring: Obsidian Ring: +3 AC, +3 DEX, +10 HP, Wt. 0.1
>Possibly have made: Platinum Jasper Ring: +6 WIS, Wt. 0.1

    If you get the SSB above, then do this.

>Wrists: Ivory Bracelets (2): +3 AGI, +20 MANA, Wt. 0.2
>Possibly quest for: Chipped Bone Bracelets (2): +4 AC, +5 WIS, Wt. 2.0

    At your level you MIGHT be able to take out Regis in North Karana for
our quest bracers, AC 9 WIS 5 - but the cost of the platinum bars would wipe
you out. Keep them in mind, but go with your plan for now. Might also want
to look into the cost of Runed Mithril Bracers on your server - they have an
additional 3 STR over the CBBs, but the price is usually kept high by demand
from druids.

>Arms: Platinum Armband: +3 STR, +3 WIS, Wt. 0.3

    I know you need STR, but ditch these and purchase some Ulthork Arms. The
lack of AC here is just wrong. If you're willing to take a mana pool hit,
you might also get a friend or two and go do Najena - Rathyl drops Hollowed
Bone Bracers, an arm item with AC, Sv. Magic and MANA.

>Hands:
>Soloing: Gauntlets of the Ardent: +12 AC, +5 AGI, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 3.8
>Grouping: Split Paw Hide Gloves: +4 AC, +3 DEX, +2 WIS, Wt. 2.0

    Good stuff. For future reference, keep checking on the price of
Gauntlets of the Black: AC 15 STR 4 WIS 3.

>Shoulders: Lizardscale Mantle: +5 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Wt. 2.5

    Buy Adamantine Epolets: AC 9 WIS 7. They'll last you for a VERY long
time, and they're cheap if you can find a pair that hasn't been sold to a
merchant.

>Chest: Bloodstained Tunic: +13 AC, +4 AGI, +4 WIS, Wt. 6.5
>In bank: Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: +12 AC, +8 vs. Fire, Cold, Magic, Wt. 4.5
>
>Back: Small Leather Cloak: +4 AC, Wt. 1.5
>Possibly quest for: Mammoth Hide Cloak: +7 AC, +4 WIS, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 2.5

    Two options here, both purchases. Cloak of the Ice Bear is AC 8 HP 10
Sv. Cold 20, and will cost 100 or less. Kunzar Cloak is AC 7 WIS 2 INT 2 Sv.
Fire 10, and only weighs point one, but is more expensive - look for it in
the 200 range, it also gets sold to merchants quite often. If you're very
brave, run to Karnor's with 100 or 150 plat and /auction WTB Kunzar Cloak
inside. It's Lore and drops fairly often, so I'm willing to bet someone will
take you up on the auction.

>Waist: Straw Spun Belt: +10 AC, Wt. 6.0
>Possibly quest for: Belt of the Cenobite: +5 AC, +7 WIS, +10 vs. Cold, Wt.
>1.5

    Great shorty belt, underpriced for stats. Low on AC, but I HAVE asked
you to improve elsewhere, and it is lightweight compared with the
Straw-Spun.

>Legs: Mammoth Hide Leggings: +6 AC, +3 STA, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 4.0
>Possibly quest for: Gatorscale Leggings: +7 AC, +4 WIS, +15 HP, Wt. 0.4

    You could do our cleric quest leggings quest with ease - those gold
ones, Greaves of the Penitent? One piece is a ground spawn, the other is off
a knockover Necromancer in Kerra Ridge. The limiting factor is the cost of
plat bars. Gator Legs could be camped by you, with fair XP to boot. But the
mob that drops them is a very rare spawn, and the spot is usually camped.

>Feet: Acolyte's Anklet: +3 AC, +3 CHA, +2 WIS, +2 AGI, Wt. 1.2

    If you ever decide you need AC, our quest boots are also very easy. Pick
up two ground spawn items, hand one to a person in Lake Rathetear, and go to
Temple of Sol Ro. Only one plat bar, too.

>Primary Melee: Sceptor of Flame: 1H blunt, Delay 29, Dmg 7, +15 MANA, +5
vs.
>Fire, Magic, Wt. 4.5

    I had one of these when I was your level. ;-) The Velium Etched Stone
Mace another poster mentioned would be better, though. More total mana,
lighter after STR included, better ratio for whacking greens, and you'd get
XP camping it. Something to consider as a possible upgrade.

    Get the Deity - the Totem is expensive, and without a tracker you won't
get it. If you have skills in Baking, you might want to do the Coldain Shawl
quest up until the point where you get a VERY nice ranged slot item.

>Ammo: Nothing
>Have no idea what I can put in here as a Halfling cleric.

    Nothing that has any effect on your stats.

>Inventory: Nothing
>Have no idea what I can put in here that will boost my stats.

    There are some food items. I think Boomba the Big in WFP sells Paladin
Pickles, which boost WIS. Consider camping the Evil Eye in Lower Guk for an
Evil Eye Bag (70% WR, 8 slots). He almost always pops, always loads the bag,
and is in an area where you and a few friends could get some nice XP - close
to the aforementioned Minotaur Patriarch, as a matter of fact. ;-)
