Well, that's the misperception.  Many things are easier in EQ than
WoW.  For example, travel.  Click on a stone in PoK and you're there.
In WoW there are a few mage ports to major cities, but basically you
want to get somewhere, you fly, and it takes time.

The "death is less painful in WoW than in EQ" argument is also a
misperception.  In fact, in EQ, you get a rez (which at the higher
levels you almost always get) and death is free.  In WoW, death
*always* costs you, and if you've got decent gear, it costs you a fair
bit.

Well, every quest that isn't a 5 man quest.  WoW is certainly more
"solo / duo" friendly than EQ, or at least than EQ used to be.

I'm assuming you never got to the upper level raids of the original
WoW content, or the Outlands raids like Kara.  Those raids require
very well coordinated groups that execute strategies to perfection.  I
would be extremely surprised if EQ has more demanding content.  For
example, in the Kara Moroes fight, losing CC on a single add means a
wipe, and since the event is on a timer, a pretty good chance that you
are going to have to clear to the boss.
