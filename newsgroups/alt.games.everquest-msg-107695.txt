Since my reply apparently didn't get propagated/seen, I will
repost it:

I try to avoid these kind of debates; I guess I shouldn't
have posted to this thread at all since there is rarely any
point in replying to rants.

There were 2 points to my post:
1. It is possible to label an action as wrong, yet still
feel empathy for the fellow human being who committed the
wrong. Every villain is the hero of his own story.

2. It is difficult or impossible to fairly judge someone if
you haven't been through similar circumstances, which I
assumed Mechanic Falls hadn't.

If getting KSed on Quillmane at level 30 while playing
EverQuest were the worst evil that ever happens to Mechanic
Falls, I will rest easy tonight and every night.
