At first, it would certainly seem in their interest to allow logged out
traders, since it would save them bandwidth.  On the other hand, it would
mean a lot more people in trader mode, and that might be a problem.

I wonder what the reaction would be if they made a way to do it, but made it
expensive some way, so that you wouldn't have everyone leaving a vendor up
whenever they aren't playing?

For example, in another game I play, you can buy a consignment merchant to
sell your stuff, which is nice, because you can go play while your merchant
handles your wares, and I believe it works while logged out, too.  However,
the catch is that you can only have a consignment merchant on the porch of
your house, so you need to buy a lot, a house, a porch, and the merchant
before you can use this system, and that isn't cheap.  A friend and I are
both playing a class that has almost no expenses, so pretty much all money
we've earned from loot is still in the bank, and we are both level 41 (out of
50), and if we combined our resoures, we could afford it.  There's also
weekly rent/tax on the lot and house.

I wonder if such a system would work in EQ?
