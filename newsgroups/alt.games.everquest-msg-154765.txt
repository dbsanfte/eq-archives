Fixing the AC of all other classes would be pretty catastrophic. Uber
mobs would be even easier than they are now. They have said they want
them to be exercises in skill and tactics rather than endurance. It
seems their approach is to ensure these "end game" mobs are
challenging, even to those who have beaten them before. It only makes
sense from both gameplay and economic perspectives.

Jacking up the warriors' AC as opposed to making a monk more like what
a monk should be would do more to close it off to other classes.

Then be less concerned with those who play the numbers game and who
don't think a mage has a place in their group. If your only purpose in
groups is mod rod creation, then consider re-evaluating your play
tactics. As I recall, mages get some pretty decent nukes and damage
shields. Just because the wizard can nuke better does not mean you
should not nuke at all. Find groups who don't expect you to just sit
and throw rods at them.

...and to the groups more interested in number crunching than having a
good time with friends.
