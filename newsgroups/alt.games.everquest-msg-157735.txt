That's the black and white issue.

The 'grey' issue is where you forego exploring for one day or so. You
won't be the first L65, or the first with any of the discs unless you
have triple comp abilities and can play 18 hours a day. Some people can,
and they'll get there first. Exploration will continue for weeks. I
seriously doubt anything could be found last night, and totally spoiled
by the time you get on today. Sure, you could be the first to zone into
somewhere, but you'll need the GUILD if you're actually planning to kill
anything substantial. 

If you need your guild to push deep into the expansion in the future,
why not think longterm and get several large scale upgrades to
guildmembers in one day, that would be unavilable for 7 days otherwise?

Either way, that's a decision for the leaders of said guild, not for
someone invited to raid and not even a member yet, to rant about in
chat.
