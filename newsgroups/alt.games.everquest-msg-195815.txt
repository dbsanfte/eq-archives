IIRC, Lanys was one of the last of the "clean" servers that were
opened before they went to the movelog/split servers (I think there
might have been one more pair after Lanys and the other that opened
with it).  Transfers were not yet allowed then.  Lanys was a "mature"
server by the time transfers were allowed (Conquest, the guild that
got disbanded for exploiting the warders in Sleepers Tomb, was on
Lanys).  Some of the guilds on Lanys, especially those that went
after high-end content, were formed by veteran players who started
over there specificly for the chance at being the big bully on the
block.  I eventually abandoned my characters there, preferring the
crowding back on Tunare to the incessant dick-waving and whining I
saw on Lanys.

Orc 1 is tougher, I have noticed that.  
Back in the day, as the youngsters like to say, Orc 1 in EC was the
site of the first ever party wipe I experienced.  A bunch of L8s
formed up and decided to try it.  Not knowing much of anything about
agro, but assuming that several of the mobs would probably come at
once, we decided to have me and a Ranger target separate mobs so that
we could split the pull and hopefully not get anyone killed instantly.
Everybody else was supposed to help the Ranger kill his target and
then we would take the rest down one at a time.  Of course, we got 5
on the pull, so without saying anything the Wizard decided to use a
column AE nuke and then run for the nearest guard.  So I couldn't LH
her, had no idea where she and the 2 orcs chasing her went, and the
cleric got snuffed for heal agro, and somebody else died, and the rest
of us ran for the zone (I think we killed one orc) with I died while
running (got lost).  So, of course, the Wizard claimed that it was to
her credit that two us lived.  :)  The CR wasn't complete until after
sunrise (we imagined that attacking at night would be an advantage,
lol).

Actually, looking back on it now, we came close to working out fairly
effective tactics on the spot.  We had an MA (a Ranger's fine at L8)
although we didn't know about /assist (I think it was broken then
anyway).  We had a tank mezzer (me) and a primary healer (a Cleric
even!).  We just didn't understand agro or pulling well at all.  Hell,
if we'd had Meemers there leading "the raid" we would've done it over
and over again until we got it right, and most of us would've learned
solid basic EQ tactics that very night instead of after another month
or two of bumbling.  Martin, where the hell were ya when you were
needed?!

I'd say that's a safe assumption.
