Now YOU are comparing apples to oranges.  Warriors are not a soloing
class, druids and necros and to some extent wizards are.  Try getting
into a group with one of those.  You should be comparing a warrior to a
cleric or possibly enchanter.  With kei my cleric can just barely solo
at 44 it's becoming near impossible even with kei, at about 36 it became
much better to group when possible, my xp jumps up much faster...  Kei
doesn't matter to my enchanter, not to mention i'd go broke really quick
if I bought it every time I died, since I die alot.  Key to an enchanter
is managing fights especially when charm soloing, and while the
increased regen is nice, I'm far far more worried about hit points.  I
quit playing my enchanter as soon as the charm nerf whent in because the
risk is the highest in the game, and while the reward made it barely
worth it, it now isn't.
