You have to be within spell range of your pet to cast on it (if you're 
using pet-only heals (and I admit I have little knowledge of shaman spells 
outside of melee buffs), these may have a much shorter range than your 
normal heals).  You also have to have some proximity to the pet to give it 
commands.  Not sure what's up with the mob proximity-on-pull, but probably 
better to pull with slow anyway, then send in the pet.

To be blunt: don't be such a wuss, you can take some hits.  This is why 
you're wearing chain and not silk or leather.  Best advice I can give to a 
shaman is to be fearless.  Take the hits when you need to and eat a death 
so that the group survives.  You getting a rez and medding back to full 
takes a LOT less time than the cleric, and not slowing an add because you 
might die is a surefire way to wipe the whole group.  Second best advice: 
get used to dying.
