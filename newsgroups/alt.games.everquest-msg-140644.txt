Now that is just a slap in the face.  I run around both Kith and Misty
looking for these dang things as part of the stein of moggok quest,
and it takes forever to find a single bixie.  When I do, they never
drop the quest piece I need.  And you are telling me they won't stop
pestering you?!

/ooc Whare are those muffled sounds of bixie-ladden profanity I hear
coming from the direction of that gnome?
