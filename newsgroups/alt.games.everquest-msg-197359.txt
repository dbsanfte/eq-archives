Hmm.  I always talk about myself in the first person... I don't even know
where you get this "third person" viewpoint, unless you're talking about the
title.  I could have titled it "I get ignored" but that's hardly
distinctive.  I put my character's name in the title so that it is quickly
and easily culled from the other thread names.  People who want to read my
stories can easily find them; people who don't want to can easily skip them
over.  So if you don't ever want to see my threads again, simply put in a
filter for "Monual"; my character's name will always be in the title.

I beg to differ; I've gotten lots of positive feedback on my stories, both
on the newsgroup and in emails.  There are, evidently, people who do enjoy
reading my stories, and I certainly enjoy writing them.

Like I said before, it's easy enough to do; just set a filter for "Monual"
and you'll never see my posts again.
