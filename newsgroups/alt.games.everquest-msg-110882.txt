Not unlike definitions of evil.  :)

The problem is that the media is only interested in bad news. Good
news doesn't make good news, after all. So the only things that get
reported about any group with any regularity is the negative stuff, or
the dramatic.

Of course, a lot of the negative press is richly deserved - people who
believe they are operating from a position of moral superiority, as
the 'political' Christians do, seem to need smacked down a lot. Recent
efforts to promote government endorsement of the Commandments springs
to mind.

There are some Jews who might disagree with that.

So, Christianity is all about peace and love, except when it's not.
