The next ranger skills you would need to train up would be at level 8
(dodge) and level 9 (when you can finally cast spells; you'll need to
put a practice point in each of the magic skills--abjuration,
alteration, channeling, conjuration, divination, evocation; you'll
also want to buy your spells, of course!).

Actually, there may be a couple other options to going to Freeport
right away (I agree that Freeport is a better newbie zone than GF,
though!):  It seems that outside Felwithe (high elf city, still in GF)
doesn't seem to be quite as crowded as outside Kelethin, and if you
stay close to the road you hopefully shouldn't get lost (and if you
do, you can just start tracking a guard and find your way back). 

Also, you could go to Butcherblock (and get a bind from the Soulbinder
in South Kaladim); they have a good newbie zone, plus you can do
several quests there, in particular the bone chip quest in the paladin
guild in North Kaladim, which is really good experience.  Once you
reach level 6 you could then move over to the Crossroads in BB and
stay there for a while, or else go to East Commons or even go back to
GF and fight around orc hill.
