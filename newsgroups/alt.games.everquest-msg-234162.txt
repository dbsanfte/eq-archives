Ouch! Luckily I figured out that the game was ProgressQuest on a stick
(perhaps more so than any MMORPG I've played) during Beta, and never signed
up. Surveying! Gah! Random spawns! Noooo! Vast expanses of boring 3D
landscape! Arrgg! Trying to be a medic! Wronggg!!!! The valley near
Anchorhead filled with random spawns ranging from "a smuggler camp_001" to
"a_smuggler_camp_999", sometimes stacked on top of one another! Grooo!!!
