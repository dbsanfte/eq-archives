Hmmmm....kind of reminds me of the loot system in Darkness Falls (the big
dungeon shared among the realms in DAoC).  I haven't been to DF (taking a
long DAoC break, because a friend did something that basically ruined the
game for me...will go back when I've forgotten about that), but my
understanding is that it works like this:

1. The hard monsters (the kinds that you'd expect to drop good loot) drop
some kind of token.  (Actually, I think they drop several of them, so that
they will split nicely in a group, so everyone is happy to just turn on
autosplit and go kill things).

2. There are several ranks of token, with the harder monsters dropping the
higher ranked tokens.

3. There are merchants in the zone that will trade you high end loot for
tokens.  The better the item, the more tokens it requires, and the higher
rank they need to be.

Sounds like the new Ragefire system is similar, except instead of buying
loot with the drops from mobs, you buy a triggering of Ragefire.

I hope that the necessary Ragefire drops come from a mix of lower level and
higher level mobs, so that any group that can normally hunt in SF will have
a chance of getting some.  I wonder if the drops are tradeable, or NO DROP?
