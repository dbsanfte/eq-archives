no it is more like buying a fishing pole, boat, every conceivable type of
lure, a fish finder, aquaview underwater camera (yes they exist, I have 2)
and then paying the game & fish dept or dept of natural resources, or
<Insert your states wildlife agency here> to stock a lake that you own with
fish of the species you wish to catch.  I PERSONALLY see nothing wrong with
it, and like Modat22 I have never purchased/sold EQ equipment on Ebay (or
any other items game related or not, I just don't trust auctions.) it should
just be a buyer beware type of situation.  Really it's not much different
than buying a console system and then getting a game genie type device to
get all the codes to make yourself virtually invincilbe.  I agree that
buying from Ebay is in direct violation of EULA by verant (ok, selling is in
violation, they (to the best of my knowledge) do not prohibit buying other
accounts, just selling)

Does it take away from the fun of the game, yes.  Does it make you a better
player if you go through the levels by yourself, yes.  Does it make someone
else less of a person for buying from Ebay, no.
