My favorite - enter PC from Hollowshade Moor.  Go down the tunnel with the
underbulk creatures and the mushroom.  Go invis (necro can invis pally) into
the cavern with the Phlargs and take the first tunnel to the right.  In that
tunnel are those Underbulk style creatures (Grimers? Sentiment Delvers?).
Those should be good for a level 20 duo, the problem might be in not getting
mobbed.  That tunnel dead ends at another tunnel.  If you go left, you'll
find a big cavern with Phlargs.  If you go right, you'll find a tunnel with
those mushrooms and insect creatures, generally spaced perfectly for single
pulling.

Marus Seru is probably a good choice for a level 24 duo.  Najena might work
too.  A good static camp would probably be the tunnel leading from Warsliks
Woods to Dalnir dungeon.  In that tunnel are 5 static spawns of Skulking(?)
Brutes (2 in one room and 3 in another room off  a tunnel to the left IIRC).
They can easily be pulled singly - low on excitement, but steady, safe xps
for a level 24 duo.
