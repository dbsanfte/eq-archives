It does help melee skill ups so if you aren't maxed, might be worth
the hassle.

Agi and AC buff help a bit if it gets you over the hump of an ac
breakpoint. Definitely uselss otherwise unless you need to buff agi to
work on defense. Especially these days, not worth the hassle since
you're ac will be far above the max cap, even untwinked if you spend a
bit of time in the bazaar.

I ran a parse once around 50th lvl, Str buff and fury line increased
my average damage by around 8%. Argueably useful to put on a tank
and/or your pet at higher lvls. Totally useless at low lvls.

Only the first one costs a compoent, snake scales iirc. Later ones are
free but even less useful than your cleric ac buffs <g>.

Yup, best newbie heal in the game!

That never changes, there's a couple of hybrids that I think get
better nukes than a shaman at high lvl.

On the upside, you do get mal-x at higher lvls. helps your roots last
longer. But you're a shaman, not a druid. Root is for adds, not for
what you're killing.

Yeah, get used to druid caliber heals. You don't really start pulling
ahead of druids as a healer till 39th lvl when you get Togor's.

Only thing it's really good for at low lvls is to help you channel
spells. You're on the right track though, slowing a mob is usually
only useful if you save a couple of heals in the fight. Often, of no
use at all before you hit 39th lvl.

Y O U   A R E   N O T   A   D R U I D !

Don't forget Flash of light (at 1st lvl), should be your get out of
trouble spell till you can start to channel root dependably around
20th lvl.

I think it's capped pretty low these days as to what lvl mobs you can
charm. Plus, at 34 you get a real pet.

Shaman pets tend to be about equal to enchanter pets hitpoint and DPS
wise. Nice DPS, especially with haste and 2 weapons if you want to
carry em around, don't expect him to tank for you. You do the tanking,
he does the killing. 

>So whats the operational model for the low level shaman?
>Slow/heal/tank, and try to make it to pet level?

Basically, up to around 20th lvl standard for me was to pull with
disease Dot (lasts about 2 minutes), throw in a poison dot when the
mob gets close, then tank it down. If you get in trouble, flash it,
back off and heal. 

Dunno if he's gonna be twinked or not, but an ikky BP and a decent
weapon (GFG for 2hb should be cheap these days or a REIF for a really
nice piercer). Given haste, your melee DPS is respectable (if you're
soloing) up till your 40s. Between haste and a weapons cap of 200 you
can do pretty good damage. Combine that with the puppy, and you loose
a lot of DPS if you just rot the mobs. 

Other than that, get out of the druid mentality. If you want to rot,
druids are much better at it with snare and their lure based dots that
don't break root. Wisdom is nice, ac and hitpoints will keep you
alive. Rotting is for the really tough mobs that you can't take any
other way, not for exp camps. It changes in PoP, once mobs start
hitting for over 500 it's hard to tank em. Now I'm a wannabe druid
again if I wanted to solo in anything past Tier 2. 

No yellow boots, no leather armor, no book in your off hand! ;-) 

A shaman is actually pretty cheap to lvl up to around 50 or so, decent
items with good ac and hitpoints are pretty cheap. Gets expensive
after that if you want a fung and JBB, which you'd need if you wanted
to keep up with the quadders, exp wise. 

If you've got a friend willing to help, try and do your epic up
through the test of might early. Doesn't take long, took me about 3
hours to escort a friends 20th lvl shaman through it recently, and the
intermediate item is well worth it. Instaclick Sow boots that also
work from inventory. Faster Jboots basically that also have decent
stats. You might also look up the cudgel quests, I know they start at
low lvls and a lot of high lvl shaman still carry one in their range
slot.
