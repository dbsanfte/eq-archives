Actually, I don't think rogues had anything to do with it.  Having to
re-hide/sneak after zoning was the price they pay for having a
hide/sneak that doesn't have a random and limited duration.

The short safe time after zoning was to work around the zoning faction
bug, I believe.  The zoning faction bug was that sometimes when you
zone, you enter the world before the player database server has
coughed up your faction information, so the zone server treats it as
if you have your default faction.  So, you port into WL, and Woushi
says "What 1500 giants?  I don't recall you killing 1500 giants for
us!" and rips your face off even though you are an ally.

[About Wizard pets]

They aren't really pets, though.  They are basically an animated buff.
They will follow the wizard from zone to zone, and if the wizard
camps, the familiar will come back when the wizard logs back in.  They
will not fight, and the only command they will obey is "/pet get
lost".  When a wizard has one, the wizard will get some kind of buff,
such as faster mana regen, or larger mana pool, or faster spell
casting.
