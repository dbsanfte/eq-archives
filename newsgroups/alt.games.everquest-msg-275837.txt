>From what I remember, divide the lower person's level by 2 and add it
to their level.  That will tell you the highest level person they can
group with.  For example, a level 40 person can group with a level 60
and still get exp, but a level 42 can group with up to 63.  I remember
this formula was relatively accurate when my girlfriend was levelling
up and she couldn't group with me for experience until she hit 43 since
I was 65...I'm not sure if it's different at higher levels now that
they've been added, but I suspect not.  In addition, this formula
definitely doesn't work at low levels, say below 20.

In LDoN adventures, all the participants must be within 7 levels of
each other (i.e. no more than 7 levels difference between the highest
and lowest level person).  I belive that for the DoN tasks this was
upped to 10 levels, but not sure if that is live yet (based on Dev
posts on the main forum).

Game on,
