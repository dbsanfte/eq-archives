Linksys BEFW11S4 802.11b (wireless) router

When they say "Dynamic" they mean that the router must be able to
automatically accept the IP address provided by your ISP. Many ISPs
have a pool of IP addresses that they "lease" to their clients (in
this case you are the client). These leased addresses expire after a
set amount of time. This function is called DHCP (Dynamic Host Control
Protocol). You need a router that is able to request a new address
automatically when the old one expires. All of the Cable/DSL routers
on the market can do this. Including the wireless LInksys noted above.

The Linksys wireless router is easy to setup, and works great with EQ.
I have the non-wireless model, and it has never given me any trouble.
(3-PCs sharing the same cable connection)
