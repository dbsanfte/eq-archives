From the shadows, the mysterious devilsmalls@juno.com (Ted D.) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

You think you raid for exp?

>Guild Raid - 4 - 5 Deaths in one 4 - 12 hour raid experience, and yes
>I see alot of you high level uber people naked all the time outside of

Aw you lost a tick of exp it takes five minutes to get back?

>LDON - Loot 100 - 600pp per adventure

>(Rashenal the Bard Kitty Cat, fell out with Wijoko (Monk) and there

Ah so that means it must happen to ALL guilds....

Theres suckers everywhere. Just because you can make money selling
them doesn't mean they're better than comparable effort drops
elsewhere.

>LDON - Stress - None ... All Fun!
>Guild Raids - stress - Lots!  People cursing ... people fighting among

Your guild is/was shit.

The only truth here is that you really don't know what you're talking
about.

I notice you failed to answer a single one of my points. Since you
were cackling about that on the other foot earlier, are you now
admitting defeat?
