If taunt was the key, warriors would not have a problem.  Taunt is a nice 
bonus on top of it, but the spells are key to getting aggro, in fact, they 
help taunt work better by making sure that even if you are not at the top 
of the list, you are very high on it, thus making the taunt far more likely 
to succeed.  The more hate you have to overcome, the less likely taunt is 
to work.
