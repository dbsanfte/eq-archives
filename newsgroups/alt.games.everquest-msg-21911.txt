My Human Ranger did this around level 7 or so.  Fed up with another train
ridden morning in Blackburrow I took a wander into the Karanas for the first
time... "Hmm, that looks like a player, I'll just have a quick chat."

Turns out it was 'a farmer' who had some rather hostile Bandit friends.  Live
(or in this case die) and learn.  I was lucky and got far enough away from the
camp that I was able to run back and loot what pitiful stuff I had.
