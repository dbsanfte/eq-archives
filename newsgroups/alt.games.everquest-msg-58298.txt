no way.  a cleric solo's better then an untwinked melee.. one example.
The undead gorillas in BW, my monk got absolutely wasted trying to fight
some of these, even with a cleric with us (there was 3 of us, and the 2 of
us tried to carry on exping while the necro was afk) the cleric would be oom
before the mob was anywhere near dead.

The necro (a r/l friend) solo'd his cleric to 56 before making a necro, they
may not be effective like druids/necros/wizards.. but as casters, they CAN
solo.  At 52 i couldn't solo ancient giants in BW (i didnt have a fungi
then)
