I joined the game just after Luclin came out (little over a week) on
the urging of my real-life GM. I didn't get to experience Velious when
it was released, but I can safely say that it was my favorite
expansion, as well. I found myself wandering around the zones of
Velious more so than the zones of any other expansion. There was a
high amount of lore weaved into almost every zone. It was clear that
when you were wandering around, you were in a -fantasy- game. A single
zone could consist of towering, lumbering giants, thuggish orcs, and
wild animals, all on a very wide range of levels. 

In the last few hours, I've been going through the zones that I missed
throughout the "old world" (base EQ, Kunark, Velious). I found myself
not bored, but actually enjoying myself. Perhaps it was because my
surroundings were that of what I originally expected out of the game;
a fantasy realm. I can honestly say I've never had as much fun
anywhere in Planes of Power, Ykesha, or the Lost Dungeons of Norrath
(good idea, badly implamented), as I have sneaking around Highkeep and
assassinating the guards with my rogue, or taking arms amongst friends
against ogre and goblin hordes.

God, I miss how it used to be. I just wish there was a way of truly
going back to that, but it's not. The lower game has been so
trivialized that nobody even takes the time to enjoy it, they'd rather
go to the bazaar, outfit their alt with uber equipment, and zoom
through till 65 in, at most, 5 different zones.

Didn't mean to rant.
