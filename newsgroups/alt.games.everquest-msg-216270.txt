snare = ranger, druid, bard, shadownkight, necro, again we see bard as being
a great person to have in a LDoN group :p  Then again, if an SK is your tank
then they are going to land that snare to get aggro anyhow :p  Also bards
have limited tracking.  I think you have to keep tracking above snare in the
instance of the assassinate or rescue missions where you may want to bypass
a lot of content.  I agree that track might not be the most important thing
to look for, but if you have high dps (which it seems is required for 3/5 of
the mission types then snare isn't really toooooo important because when the
mob turns to run it should die quickly.  At higher levels though CC is
imperative because those adds can do a lot of damage and take down your
cleric/casters quickly.
