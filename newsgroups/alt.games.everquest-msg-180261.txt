     Really?  Yikes!  I've been playing for about 2 years and
I've never hear those terms used in reference to EQ race till
now.  I guess I lead a sheltered life.

  Hmm... I can see it working the the other way, though.  If I
were in a party and I heard "This group rocks!  Even the nigger
cleric is pulling his weight!", either that person would be out
of the group or I would.  Even if I knew it would be hard to get
into another group.  Nor would I ever group with someone with a
name like "Kikekiller", or whatever.  But then, I tend to be a
bit weird that way.  I won't get my hair cut at a place that
posts different prices for men and women, for example.
