Well, to be fair, druids and shaman have travel buffs and clerics don't.
:)  And the conversation centered around their healing abilities, not
their "other" ones.  But unfortunately there is no concessus yet on which
is the best soloer.  As a templar I've been able to solo just fine.  I
hear both druids are good because of their powerful combo of damage
shields and regens.

Honestly, I think they all CAN solo, so if travel buffs matter to you, go
with shaman or druid.  Then pick the one you want based on preference and
city (ie, no defilers in Qeynos, no mystics in Freeport).
