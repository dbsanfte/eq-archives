Not to mention that with the trivials for creating the spells set where they
are, it is heartbreaking to attempt to make your current research only
spells.  You need to be several levels higher than the required level for
the spell to have a decent chance at making the spell.

I would recommend learning spell research, but I also recommend finding a
high level person of your class to do the combines for you for your spells.
