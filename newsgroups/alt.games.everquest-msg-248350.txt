You have just addressed WHY so many alt groups don't propagate, they
weren't "officially" created so a lot of servers won't pick them up.

Heck with some servers the only thing you'd need to do to create a group
is crosspost a message to it.
Those are the ones that advertise how they carry a few hundred thousand
groups, and that's why they have so many - they automatically add any
group referenced that doesn't already exist.
