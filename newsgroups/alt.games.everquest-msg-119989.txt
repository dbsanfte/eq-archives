    The recipient will get a message and a buff icon. It's not like a
Folger's commercial: "Bob's aggro has secretly been replaced with new,
enhanced Trickster's Augmentation! Let's watch!"

    We don't use it (our main tanks have BoC's, SoD's, Hategivers, and
likely half a dozen other aggro toys I don't know about), but an Asian guild
which we've been watching has been using it. It's amazing what they can do -
this is a guild that just started killing big stuff in Kael, remember that.
They kill Tormax with one warrior. Tormax *never* leaves that warrior, and
they keep him healed. For a small guild, that's one hell of an
accomplishment.

    If it works the way I think it works based on Dan's description, yeah -
it has to be changed. It sounds like it just lowers faction (creating
greater hate) globally. That could be used like Dan described to grief
someone in a town AFK, for example. Hmm - I bet a griefer could answer the
question of whether a buff lands, then the effects of the buff, or the
effects first then the actual "You have been buffed" effect. If they got
attacked after the person they griefed (because they buffed a KOS person),
you'd know the "you have been buffed" part is last. =)

    You forgot the chanter doing a /giggle.
