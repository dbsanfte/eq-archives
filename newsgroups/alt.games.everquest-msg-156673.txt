Usually when kiting, you will want to go get your 4 MoBs, and then drag them
to a safe spot for the kiting. Kiting where there's a chance of adds is not
recommended.
That said, what I usually do is bring in the add in my quad. Sure, I can
still only hit 4 of them, but at least I know where it is. Also, considering
you most likely won't kill all 4 MoBs with the same blow, you will damage
the add a bit before taking it out alone afterwards.
