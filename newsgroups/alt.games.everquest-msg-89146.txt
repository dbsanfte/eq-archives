Hi - I'm a lvl 15 Druid Wood Elf.

I've made a few cheapish purchases (split paw gloves, wooden totem as well
as the standard leather
clothing). My problem is this - I've currently got about 100pp, and after a
trip to the EC auctions, have found
WIS+ equiptment terrifyingly expensive ! Everything I've viewed has been
from 300pp and above - I
can't afford the stuff !

So I was wondering - have I just been unlucky so far ? Also, what is the
best place to make money
(ie at my lvl what is the best loot?). My starting city is Kelethin, and
though the Orc lego's etc drop a little
money and cb pads and belts, so is it better to stay there ? At what lvl can
a Druid start to afford stuff
like the Paw of Oppala (spelling may be a bit off there).

*Or* should I be satisfied with my current setup, and stop being so greedy
?!

Also, a final question - considering my lvl, what sort of equiptment should
I be looking at purchasing ?
I've been to a few websites, but they just list the stuff - didn't find any
level = recommended equip
suggestions. Any help would be appreciated !

TIA.
