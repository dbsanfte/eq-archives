Once again, I apologise on the behalf of Druids everywhere... we're not ALL
idiots ;o)

How can any Druid/Ranger NOT know the usefulness of snare on fleeing mobs??
And wtf is that excuse for "root is mana free"??? She couldn't spare 40 mana
for a snare out of a pool of +2000??? (I'm assuming she's well equipped and
knows about her equip if he got the Tunare Symbol... so she should be close
to 200Wis and some mana adds) Even if she's primary healer, 40 mana for a
snare is way better efficiency than the 500+ you'd waste on healing the SK
after meleeing a rooted mob! :o)
