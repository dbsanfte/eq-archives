On the raid I did last night on Rydda'dar, Ivory Etched Aegis dropped.
It's a shield with a furious bash effect (to raise hate). Not all that
rare, really.

However, when it came time to bid on it, it was won by a *ranger* who
bid most his dkp wad on it.

I've encountered this ranger a few times before and he did not strike
me as very bright, but this certainly was a boggler. He must be
thinking about the stats while using archery, but still.... talk about
a poor use of points.
