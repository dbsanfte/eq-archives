Look, if a kid *were* able to understand this, first thing they would
ask is "how does this happen?"  Whats mommy gonna tell them? - well
son, it happens when you stick your pee-pee in Johnnys little ass.

So OUR kids lies are more valuable then theirs??  ...I see how you are.

Look, if you can't teach an ADULT African not to get AIDS, how the fuck
are you gonna teach an African child ??

Well, for the starters, the gay movement(s) should promote ABSENTANCE
amoung gays like it is being promoted to hetro's.

Mom to teen #1: Son, you like boys or girls ?
Son: Girls, why?
Mom: Ok, then DON'T fuck any of them! - think "absentance".

Mom to teen #2: Son, you like bos or girls?
Son: Boys, why?
Mom: Ok, just make sure to use a rubber when porking Johnny in the ass.

...No double standard *there* now is there ?
