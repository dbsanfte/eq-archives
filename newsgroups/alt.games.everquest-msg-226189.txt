It's not really that large.  Figure max of 65636 quests, so each quest can
be identified by a 2 byte number.  450000 subscribers with each subscriber
doing 1000 different quests among all their characters would take under a
gigabyte to store.  Note that this data is only needed when a quest is
completed, so that the list of quests for that character can be retrieved
and the charm updated.

Yeah, it sounds more like an EQ2 thing.
