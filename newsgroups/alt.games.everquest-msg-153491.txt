Just caught this on Casters Realm.  I'm sure you've all seen it, but
here goes:

MASSIVE EVERQUEST CHANGES COMING

A massive change to EverQuest is coming soon in order to correct
faults that 'have been allowed to grow out of control'.
Here's the summary: 

Manaburn is being changed to only allow one manaburn to be cast on an
NPC per minute (pending tuning). Wizard with Manaburn will have their
AA refunded if they wish tp ourchase different skills. 
Complete Heal is being reduced to a 7500 hitpoint heal. 
Rods of Mystical Transvergence (Mod Rod 2) will no longer be droppable
but made into a targettable summon. They will give 320 mana for 450
hitpoints and only be usable once per minute. 
Monks will have their effective AC lowered in order to make them more
realistic as a light armored offensive class and to restore more
tanking prestige to plate and chain classes. 

OK, so they're addressing the monk issues somewhat, but wow, are the
clerics ever going to scream....
