First Fist of Light stuff is mostly either disowned lore from EQ beta (i.e.
not true) or fanfiction with no basis in Norrathian lore (i.e. not true).
The only stuff they do have that is right is any info from in-game (the
books in PoK, quest text, etc) but it's usually twisted to suit their own
ends.

1FoL are the guild that had a public screaming match with GMs over the
Qeynos/Karana plague final event because it wasn't going the way 1FoL
claimed it would, by the way.
