I've heard it does, although personally I just killed those stupid fucking
sharks. Another way to do it is to levitate above the spot where the
spirits spawn. This is kind of cheesey, and you miss out on some fairly
amusing conversation threads, but it makes you immune to shark attack.
You'll be able to hear the greater spirit casting when he spawns.

Lots of items in the game identify with names different than their "public"
names. Just make sure you get all 6 of them, they all have different
"paper" graphics, and have distinct names. If you have good skill in
speaking lizardman, you can read them for the backstory (which is really
pretty good).

4 should be enough, but you can get fish scales in the pond in the middle
of blackburrow by killing the razorgills. Also there is likely a merchant
in Qeynos who has been sold scales by a budding fisherman.
