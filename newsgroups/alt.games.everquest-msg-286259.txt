The last time I played EQ, this would not have been correct.

1 target = 3 waves
2 targets = 2 waves, hitting both targets
3 targets = 1 wave hitting 3 targets, and 1 wave hitting 1 target
4+ targets = 1 wave hitting at most 4 targets

But they certainly could've changed it since I left.

PC pets used to count as a target for rain spells (although,
obviously, no damage was done to them,) and a change to the
way rain spells worked was propagated so that they no longer
did (maybe 4 years after they learned it was broken.)  When
they made that change, they made it so that NPC pets as well
as PC pets didn't count as targets (NPC pets were still damaged,
however.)  You used to be able to eke a little more efficiency out
of rain spells when NPC pets were present.  I have no idea if that
is still the case, though.
