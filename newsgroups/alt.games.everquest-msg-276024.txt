Lifetaps for 1500 exactly. And reasonably often. This was still true as 
of last week. Chain rune's on the MT is a strategy for dealing with him, 
and mitigating his proc a bit. He is quite resistant.

Yup.

Just to clarify... that's Venril Sathir's Remains, vs Venril Sathir. VSR 
is a comparative pushover.

1) That doesn't really get you the Hand of Glory though which was the 
stated objective, and 

2) the floating trick is PC specific. I can cross by floating without 
trouble everytime. My friends PC can't. Just can't. Something to do with 
levitate drop rate being tied to the CPU or something but even with SoE 
he falls too fast 100% of the time. I've tried it on his machine and 
can't do it, so its not him. I tried logging his char onto mine to get 
him across and that works.

3) And to address the op's comment, I completed my HoG a couple weeks 
ago, and was able to move through all wings by obtaining the various no 
rent keys. (Took a couple days to do it though, and had to keep keys on 
a duel corpse for the interim.)

I've probably done 20 LDoN collects in the last 2 months (all themes), 
the most recent one was last night. Completed every one of them with at 
least 20 minutes to spare (with a 3 man team), and never cleared more 
than half the dungeon. What you are describing seems highly irregular.

/agree
