Assuming no one interferes, you and a similar level healer (or any partner
probably) would have no problem at all.  I soloed the AC in East Karana in
the low 40's as a paladin (with LoH), and the AC in South Ro seems about
the same difficulty the few times I've come across him.

If you all jump the AC at once, then you stand a good chance at winning if
everyone nukes and stabs away, but chances are you'll all be spread out
searching for "Homer", so it's pretty much a crapshoot.  Good luck to you!

> 3. What is the minimum levels and requirements for the AC in OOT?

I've heard he's about as strong as a Seafury cyclops, which is
significantly tougher than the S. Ro version.  That group you mentioned
before might be able to kite the AC and win, but holding the camp could be
very tough for several more levels.  I'd wait for the high 40's to try
that, YMMV.
