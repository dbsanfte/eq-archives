If the mob is already fleeing, I agree 100%.  In other words, if you
forget (or the designated snarer forgets) to snare and the mob starts
running, then use TW.  However it's best, IMO, to snare the mob
properly before he starts fleeing.  Tangling Weeds, unlike Snare or
Ensnare, only lasts 18 seconds and can randomly wear off like root or
camo.  Therefor, the only way to stop a fleeing mob with TW is to cast
it just as it runs.  Trying to stop all fleeing mobs with Tangling
Weeds is insanity.  There is a much thinner margin for error and a
resist can mean a wipe.  Cast a regular snare at 50% or whenever you
find that you can do so without taking much aggro.  Use Tangling Weeds
in an emergency, to get aggro, or if kiting to slow a mob before you
cast a proper snare.

0.5 seconds, but same difference.

Around level 25 or 30 he can quest for these himself...it really
should only take a few hours.  And if he is a glutton for punishment,
he can try to do the swiftclaw sash quest at the same time.  (more
like a few days probably).

Cool.  I had noticed that walling wasnt a problem anymore.  I hadn't
heard about mez breaking being solved.  Strange...since this really
never seemed like a bug to me.  It seemed reasonable that if you
didn't use your bow correctly, you could hit a mezzed mob.

So here's another question.  I have been known, especially when
soloing, to root one mob and shoot at it with another mob between us. 
That way you hit the mob nearest to you, which isn't rooted, and
therefor do double damage to it.  (Much like tanking a dragon or giant
with your bow).  Anyone know if this is "fixed" so that you always hit
what you aim for and nothing else?
