There's a RL husband-wife pair in my guild. They each have several
characters, and only one of each of their characters are in
relationships with each other. Their other characters have romantic RP
with other people's characters.

One reason roleplayers should either only marry roleplayers or marry
someone they can corrupt-err, introduce to roleplaying. ;-) Makes for
far fewer misunderstandings. In-character is in-character, OOC is OOC.
While an IC romance may lead to an OOC friendship, it doesn't mean an
OOC romance.
