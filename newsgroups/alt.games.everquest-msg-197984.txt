Considering sta gear is harder to find then str gear: go with sta. The minor
difference you get with your starting points is negligable in regards to the
gear you wear. As a monk you should have both over 150 by the time you get
around lvl 40. By the time the difference may start to count you'll have
both around 200 or so and it will be maxed with shammie buffs.
By the time you really want to start maxinging hp/damage you can just train
AA's to increase personal flaws and get buffed to the max anyway
