For some classes more is better, others don't stack well.  For
example, enchanters don't stack well in most high-end encounters.  The
slow is handled by shaman, so other than hasting tanks and lowering MR
on the mob, there isn't much for them to do.  One enchanter is
required, two are nice, three are too many.  Druids, shaman, necros,
etc suffer similar fates.  Nukers and tanks stack well, as long as you
have enough healers.
Generally, we're trying to keep the guild small enough to manage
easily and still have a family feel, yet large enough to do the
really, really tough zones.  We don't want to become a  Zergling
guild, anyone can take down a mob with 60 level 56+ characters, we
prefer to actually learn the game mechanics and use strategy and
tactics.
We have published our class targets at
http://www.mom.powerwebpage.com/site/main_9.cfm?content_id=4954
The current numbers are a bit off, haven't added our newest folks, and
it doesn't count high-level alts.  (We've got several high-level tanks
on 2nd accounts, so we're not down to using bards as tanks yet.)
