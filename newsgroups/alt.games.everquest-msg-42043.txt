I personally never run the belt quest since the $$$ was more important than
the exp to me.  But, the EmeraldWarrior faction is the one you are looking
for for selling.  Get enough of that and you will be an ally of the Kelethin
Warrior Guild.  They love my necro in there.

Can't help you with the dwarven faction questions.
