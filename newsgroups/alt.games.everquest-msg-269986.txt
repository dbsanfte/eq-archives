I think the way they should have done the books was the way the original 
ports in velius worked, you had to recover a "tooth" before the port would 
work for you (ie. you had to go there at least once by foot). The only 
difference was the first port in in Iceclad. It could have been the same for 
the books, only the POT and Nexus books would work automatically. Otherwise 
you would have to have traveled UP from a book before you could travel down 
on it, but alas that is not how it worked, so people complain.

EQ2 has the bell, but that is not really the same. WoW has their transport 
system such that you can't use an end point until you have gotten there at 
least one time. EQ2 and WoW both have the map not displaying until you 
uncover parts (at least in the large world in EQ2).

For a true newbie I am begining to think WoW has the easiest to get into 
game. Tradeskills are simple (and cant be done without a harvesting skill) 
and the big one, you can make LOTS of different characters to try out and 
come back to the one you end up liking, EQ1 has this, EQ2 does not really 
have this with the 4 character limit and the skill tree, I pity the person 
that gets 4 characters to 20, realizes they don't really like anyone exactly 
right yet, and has to choose one to delete, later learning more of the game 
play realizing that the deleted one fit thier playstyle more as the game 
grew on them.
