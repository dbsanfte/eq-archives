Nope, I never said that.

If you think I said that, go back and read the thread again so.

I will spell it out for you and if there is anything you don't get out of
it, make a specific challenge.

You can not say EQ/VI is smart or stupid. Based on the market so far, you
can only say they are less stupid then the competition. Sample size is too
small to say more then that.

Visacalc programmers were smart until Lotus 123 came out. Lotus 123
programmers were smart until Excel came out.

When someone that is a known quantity in the game market, Blizzard for
instance, comes out with a persistant on line world to directly compete with
EQ, then you can measure.

In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.

We have yet to see how he does vs people with two eyes. The only conclusion
you can draw from the previous statement is the man is less blind then the
competition, for now.
