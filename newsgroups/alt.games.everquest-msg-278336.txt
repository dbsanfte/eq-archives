Last night and today, I have been busily giving away all of 
my tradable items before my accounts lapse and I came across 
many anomalies. It seems that somewhere along the line, 
almost all of the newbie armor weapons have been F'd up. I 
just happened to notice when I was asked to link one and the 
person started laughing. I went and checked many chars over 
the next hour or so and found almost all were bugged. 1HS 
weps showing as 1HB in stats. Piercing as 1HS. What used to 
be nice books (Froglok Wizard) now show as 1HB. I wonder 
when this mess arose? I did most of these quests when they 
were new to the game, and have not revisited many since 
then. Anyone else notice anything strange on their non 
newbie quest weps?
