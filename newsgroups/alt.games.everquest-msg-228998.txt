Heard it will be UO style. You get a bare character you create based upon 
the usual Strengt, Stamina and Mana. But all skills are enabled so you can 
decide whether it should be a warrior, cleric, mage etc. or hybrid of 
those. Skill cap will make it possible for not being a god that is 
grandmaster in all skills.

Remember something I heard and something that might not be completely true.
