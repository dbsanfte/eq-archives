Ok - ill amend what I said... I should have said no one SHOULD...
better?

Wish my post didnt fragment into two posts - maybe it would have been
more coherent (then again maybe not). The point was that while Adam
was rather abrubt in what he said, there is value in grouping, and
doing so early on. The class the OP chose is not a good solo class.
Its very dependant on the abilities of others (unless of course you
have really nice gear I suppose). The sooner he discovers the benefits
of grouping, the less chance he will become frustrated with that
class. This is not meant as a cop out or a snide remark, but, if the
OP really prefers soloing - he might find more enjoyment out of the
game with a more solo-friendly class.

If someone's idea is fun is to race to being uber, then perhaps you
are pissing on thier fun by saying that *shrugs*

And I agree - that discovery process is the most exciting thing in the
game. When you take down that mob with a group of friends, and
discover how all your skills compliment each other, its exciting to
work together and form a tight team - at least to me it is.
