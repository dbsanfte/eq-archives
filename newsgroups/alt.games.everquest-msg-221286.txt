I run EQ on Linux, everything works just fine but I miss some of the
utilities from the windows world.

One of the things I'd really like to do is run logs through a parser to
keep up on DPS for my beastlord and, more importantly, the pet.  

Is anyone aware of any parsers that either are native to *nix or are Perl
or something similar based?
