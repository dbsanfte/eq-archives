Black Panther looks cool. That's about it.

Reinforced Acrylia is far superior for the reasons you mentioned.
Also, Reinforced is cheaper because its easier to make, the ingredients
for the recipe are easier to get, and every tailor is using acrylia to
skill up on so there is a glut in the market on it.

Black Panther needs a serious upgrade.

BTW monkly business has a nice upgrade thread on their message
board for the most common upgrade path with dropable/tradeable items.

I tend to lean a little to more resists side since when I die its
usually to casters so I am paranoid about it. =)

I once dueled a monk that went for str/dex/agi stats. He was
2 levels higher than me and had better weapons. I beat him.
Not only did I beat him but I beat him by such a large margin
it even surprised me.
