I think the lawsuit is a bunch of shit myself, but in all fairness
it's kind of hard for most people to understand the pain this woman is
*probably* going through right now.  For a parent to lose a child is
pretty fucking devastating.  I understand that she wants to find a
reason for what happened to her child.  And aiming that scrutiny at
yourself when you feel that kind of pain is almost impossible for a
lot of people.  Lashing out is normal, and *to a certain extent*,
healthy.

That said, I think there are probably some lawyers involved with this
that need to be beaten like circus monkeys.
