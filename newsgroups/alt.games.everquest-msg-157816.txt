Actually, having different delays on the weapons should help hold
agro when you're MT.  You're gonna have shorter intervals between
opportunities to regain the mob's attention should it decide some
other attacker looks tastier.

Pretty sure that Wurmslayer (25/40) will outdamage Lamentation or
Defiance (9/19 on both), for instance, until lo- or mid-50s.  The
only real problem would be that it'll be harder to hold agro with
it than with a fast weapon, so ideally he'd have a fast weapon to
swap in if holding agro was an issue.
