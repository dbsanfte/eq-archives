Ok, I'm tired of this stuff, here's a counter example, a *true* counter
example.

A few people buy the game at the same time, because they want to start
playing.  So, they all install it, they live in different places, but they
have chatted a bit before hand, and they start a few characters.  They
figure that if they have a cleric, a paladin and an enchanter they should
be able to get a good start.

So they start a character each, fill in some stats, give them a name,
choose a face, and then enter the world.

Tada, magic.

So, the Erudite Paladin asks the Dwarven Cleric where they are, and the
Human Enchanter explains what they can see.

How the hell do those three friends play the game together, without PoK.
Oh, well they can't choose those races, they have to play other races.  But
they don't want to, they want to load up the game, pick a race that sounds
FUN and start playing and have some FUN.

But they can't, because first of all they have to survive the run to
various different docks, then work out where to meet up, then survive the
buggy boat ride without dying somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and
then perhaps, an hour or two later, they all meet up, and bang, a random
orc pawn kills the cleric and they have to wait another HOUR for them to
get back to the group.

Oh yeh, a boat load of fun that is.

By some MIRACLE they continue playing the game, and make it to level 20.
They're still hanging around in Crushbone because it's ok XP.  Another
friend they've made sends them a tell, got a group going in Highpass Keep,
excellent fun, having a blast, would love you to come and socialise with us
and have fun, room for 3 more.

Sure, be there in an hour.

Oh, an hour?  We'll be gone by then, sorry.

Choice is the key thing here.  NO ONE in the game is stopping you making
the run through Kith to get to HK.  But when my friend sends me a tell, and
says we have a space, and I've got 40 minutes to play, I thank the Gods
that someone decided to add PoK, and the PoK books, because I can get
there, and have FUN doing something with my friends, in under 5 minutes.

All the rose coloured bloody glasses in here are beginning to bug the crap
out of me.  You can argue until you're blue in the face that PoK and quick
transport has ruined the game for you, but until you demonstrate how
helping me have fun with my friends more quickly is BAD while still having
the CHOICE to explore if I want, then I'm going to have to ignore you.

How many counter examples do you need?

It's a game.  It's about having fun.  It's not a religion, nor is it your
own child.

When I've been duoing in Hate for 40 minutes to pass the time with my
warrior and shaman, and a friend logs on and says hey, we're doing a DoN in
about 5 minutes can you come tank for us and HAVE SOME FUN, I don't say 'oh
no sorry, I'll need to find a wizard to get me out of hate', I use the
origin AA, or a gate potion, or a quested gate item, or I bloody run up to
the Hand of Maestro and engage him and take ranger-gate back to the guild
lobby, summon, get rezzed and GO AND HAVE FUN WITH MY FRIENDS.
