You can change the scheme of your room (for a price!).  We have changed some
of the timber on the walls and the roof.
You can also add more furniture/accessories.
I am not sure if the item limit per basic inn room is still 25, there may be
some sort of increase in the big patch coming up in the new year.

You can also have a look around any rooms that have been marked as "visitor"
and see what's there.
Most (if not all)merchants will have their homes set to accept visitors -
you can look at some really nice places that way.

You can relinquish your room before it's due for payment, but make sure you
pickup all of your items before you do or you will lose them.
If you make any changes to the room, then relinquish it and go back in, any
changes you have made will be lost.
