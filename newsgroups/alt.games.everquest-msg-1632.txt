Well, while I certainly agree that my fair-skinned cousins could be a
bit more humble, they are actually wonderful creatures if you take the
time to speak with them.  I myself sometimes find them a little
extravegant in their language, but their tales and legends do more to
relate the entire history of Norrath than anyone else.  They obviously
do have interest beyond their realm, though I sometimes think they
don't really value all histories equally.  Be that as it may I can't
believe that any gnome with your sour disposition would call any other
creature short of an orc rude.

I have also spent a good deal of time exploring Ak'Anon and the
Steamfont mountains as a young Elf, and think I am quite aware of
Gnomish concerns.  I was actually facinated by your tinkering as a
lad, and spent many days sitting in the meadows outside Ak'Anon
running errands for the Gnomes just to watch them tinker.  I have
studied it as much as anyone not born to it could, and am deeply
appreciative of any Gnome who would take the time to explain the
functions of the items.  (Of course there was a time when I really
wished that one would let me attempt to tinker a bit myself, but I now
know that to be impossible.)

As much as I dislike the orcs, I can't advocate the wholesale
slaughter of an entire race.  I have personally spent several seasons
working to end their slavetaking ways, but fear that their alliances
with our wretched dark cousins complicates matters to some large
degree.  Also, the orcs really secured their position while we were
helping to secure a suitable home for our friends, the gnomes.  I
would certainly not blame YOU personally for the infestation of orcs,
but had we been self-centered and concentrated on expelling all the
orcs, I daresay the gnomes would still be attempting to hollow out
tree-trunks and causing great consternation as entire neighborhoods
come crashing down due to what all the histories invariably refer to
'minor miscalculations on the exact forces at work'.

You sir, are becoming boorish.  Should I refer to all gnomes as slugs?
You live under rocks and have a rather sickly pallor?  I think that
even a curmudgeon such as yourself can debate without constantly
resorting to childish namecalling.

How can anyone find fault with love?  Are you sure that you aren't a
clockwork?  Granted their is a time and a place, but as I have my
swords sheathed, and my instruments at the ready, I find almost every
moment ripe for love, or at least seduction.

Bah, ingrates!  The Elves of Kelethin and Felwithe have a long and
successful partnership with the Dwaves of Kaladim.  While we don't
always agree on every detail, we have mutual respect and many common
interests.  I used to think the same of the Gnomes, but the actions of
some of the more obnoxious Ak'Anonians have made me reconsider.  While
there are still a number of Gnomes that I have met throughout my
travels on the known and newly discovered continents with whom I have
exceedingly cordial relationships, I'm finding that more and more seem
to be sullen and selfish little creatures.  I wouldn't be suprised to
find you emulating those inexplicably nasty and murderous halflings
that seem to delight in slaughtering the dwarven guards at their
lonely outposts throughout Butcherblock.  (Of course I'm not referring
to all halflings, or even to all halflings who study the druidic arts,
but rather to that subset who have turned to evil and mayhem.)
Sir, I truly worry for Ak'Anon if you represent the common gnome now.
It is already a place without song or music, and I fear it will soon
become a city without joy.  (Even the Ogres dance, though I not sure
about the Trolls.)
