I have the same problem. I also cannot get to the web site
http://everquest.station.sony.com/  It just keeps coming back with the
cannot find server error. Also if it was on our end, why can we get to the
patch server? I hit the patch server and it runs, when I actually try to log
on, it never establishes comms with the login server. I say definately on
thier end.
