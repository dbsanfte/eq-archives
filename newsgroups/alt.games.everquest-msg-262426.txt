Yes, they do!  If you don't believe it listen to their rhetoric.  Or ignore it,
like you apparently do.

Yes, I do, but if you pay roughly 8% of your income for 50 years, you would
have to live over 150 years of age to recoup what you would have gotten had
your money been in an interest bearing account as opposed to the governments
welfare backup money.

Apparently you do not listen to anything the Dems are saying.  Remember the
phrase "Risky Tax Scheme" repeated like a Buddhist monk during the 2000
election.  Scaring seniors into thinking that they won't have any money if they
privatize Social Security.
