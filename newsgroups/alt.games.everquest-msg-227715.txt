What level are we talking about? I can put out 30-50DPS depending on if I
have melee buffs, if the mob is undead, and depending on frequency of nukes.
But a Clerics primary function is dispensing heals, if the Clerics in danger
of going OOM then damn right he should be sitting down. A Cleric should only
be melee/nuking if he has so much mana he doesnt know what to do with it or
if he knows that he can melee/nuke and stay FM consistantly. In that case
its obvious the Cleric is losing mana and will sooner or later be OOM in
which case he should not be meleeing.
