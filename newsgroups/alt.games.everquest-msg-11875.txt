Rangers have many good aspects. They get good weapons that let them pump
out a lot of damage. Tracking is invaluable. Snare is a lifesaver in a
dungeon. They make for the best pullers in outdoor zones by using harmony.
They can even do mediocre healing. They also have three major drawbacks
that hurts them greatly:

1) Their hp are rather lacking compared to other tank classes
2) They have tissue paper quality armor.
3) The high damage output from the aforementioned good weapons (and the
MASSIVE taunt factor from snare) causes their also previously stated HP/AC
to be tested frequently. Usually with poor results.

Once you hit level 45 or so, it takes a well balanced group to go with a
ranger as the primary tank...

But, I was in a group with a 59 ranger as the only melee, and we conquered
and destroyed D1 and D2 in Sebilis for 5 hours. So it isn't like they are
hopeless.
