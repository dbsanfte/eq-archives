No, I don't. Luckily, people naming their cars isn't a problem in EQ.

True, it's just the way things *are*. It's not the way people in, say,
a Tolkien or Salvatore book would speak with any regularity. I just
think the nicknames that offer nothing in the way of additional
connotation.

"Chanter" is a shortening of "enchanter" to a more wieldy term,
however minor. "Mage" offers the same benefit. "Asslings", though I
don't care for it, at the very least conveys a person's contempt for
the race in-game. "Inkies", as I said above, is not really a good
example of what I'm talking about, since it can be used to also
reflect racial tension.

"Wizzie" is nothing more than an alternative to the established term -
for what? Is it so bad to actually use the most correct, well-known
word for something? "Wizzie" is just an attempt at a fresh spin on
something simply because it's *old*.
