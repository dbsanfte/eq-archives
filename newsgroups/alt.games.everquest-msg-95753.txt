See this isnt so hard after all . Your a damn bard and thus will almost
never die in the 30 seconds it takes for you to poof from the world . You
can just stand there and take it being a plate tank class. Every single
caster can be easily ganked in that 30 seconds where if they where in
control they would have no chance of dying.

I dont give a damn about a new method to protect ld tanks , I care only
about fixxing the absurd problem of a caster losing multiple hours of
playing due to a crappy connection.

Casters only die for real in a few very specific circumstances and almost
never while soloing.

A) they die because they got jumped after they just died before and have no
spells memmed
b) they die becasue they got rooted, stunned , or snared.
c) they die because the mob chasing them is faster than they are.
d) they die because they have several dots stacked on them.

e) they die in a party all the time so lets discount this for now since
going ld in a party is not a catastrophe , other party members can and will
pull mobs off of you.
