Something was entered wrong. It's saying that your current
intelligence after all the modifiers is 39. "Your modified mana at
this level" tells you what your current total is. "Extra mana as a
result of modifiers" tells you what the difference between your mana
"naked" is and what it is fully equipped based on the information you
gave it. Notice the - in front of the 456....
