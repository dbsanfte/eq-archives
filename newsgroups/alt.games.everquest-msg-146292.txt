That is based on personal observation.  That is why I said *guess*.  I think
you are mistaken if you think druids are the only soloers.  High percentages
of necros, mages, beastlords and wizzies solo.  If you spend most of your
time grouping in dungeons, you might not notice the number of soloers in
other zones.
