Tell me, again, what this "sincere complaint" is about?

You said:

"Is [sic] seems to me that Verant's customer service is becoming more
and more useless. They claim that they are trying to be more responsive
and helpful, but in realty, it appears to be quite the reverse. They
come up with all these situations where they won't help a player out.
Why not? Most of the situations where they refuse to help have nothing
to do with game balance which is a concept they always try to hide
behind."

Then, you said:

"The point? I think more people need to start bitching at VI and get
them off their lazy asses and do what WE PAY THEM TO DO."

First of all, I don't think you realize that your $10, excuse me, $20
per month really is not even a dot on the radar when it comes to the
impact it has on SOE's cashflow. Also, try to realize that 9 out of 10
CS reps that you would deal with, online, don't even get paid. The
Guides are all there voluntarily. It's the GM's that actually get paid
by VI, and you will usually never deal with them.

Also, have you ever been a guide, or a CS Rep for any online game? Do
you have even the foggiest idea as to what sort of workload the guides
deal with when they are on? You seem to be saying that your problems are
more important than everyone else's as indicated by your disdain due to
an "untimely" response, or even lack thereof. Unfortuanately, you really
can't say with any certainty that they were, in fact, sitting on their
asses and ignoring you (any more than I can say they were not).

The point that I am trying to make, though, is that you really ought to
check the attitude at the door. Yeah, maybe you got skipped. Shit like
that happens, but it's just a game. Just because you had one bad
experience doesn't mean that the whole company, or system for that
matter, sucks. All it means is that you had a bad situation. You, like
everyone else, are more than welcome to leave if you have a problem with
it. Hell, one or two less people online will make the CS job that much
easier. I don't think you'll really hear them complaining.

Just my 2cp
