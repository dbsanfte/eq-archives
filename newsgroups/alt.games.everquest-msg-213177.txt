   I had the same thing happen.  Got moved, but still couldn't get in,
though the person who helped me(thanks again!) was able to log in as me
fine and get me to the PoK with no trouble at all.

   So, I gave up.  And about two minutes after I did, I found this
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/045561.html in
the Sony forums.  It worked for Lenny and me.  You might want tell your
friend about it and see how it turns out.
