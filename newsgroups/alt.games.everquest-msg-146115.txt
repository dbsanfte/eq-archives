They might have thought this is a bug, but I found it very useful. When in a 
group or partnered I could more effectively heal because I'd see my target's hp 
go above 100%. If I healed someone and their hp went to 135% for an instant then 
I'd know next time to wait until they were a bit lower on health to heal them so 
I'd get the best mana/heal ratio. If their hp went up to just 101% when I healed 
them then I'd know about when to heal them next time so that I could keep them at 
full health while making sure all of my heal spell's potential healing was being 
used.
