Windowed mode is the screen where you have a upper central section of
screen with the game view, and the rest fo the screen has various section
with the blue fill etc where you can see your spell book icon etc.

Hmm, well as well as the empty full screen hitting f10 gives that screen
with semi transparent boxes for text, spell crystals etc.

The extra GUI I've been talking about (ie a see through inventory) is a
Velious expansion feature that has to be enabled.

Go to the view every is calling windowed...click on the options button in
the top left.

Go to video options button. THere is something asking if you want windows
all the same size regardless of resolution (Fixed window size, i think it
says). THen change resolution size.....you should get a change come in.
Hit f10 once or twice and you will cycle through windowed, full screen
with no info and full screen with extra info.....the boxes will all be
smaller that you used to have, several will have become resizeable and if
you hit the inventory key at that point it will show in the screen rather
than in a windowed view qith loads of blue fill flashing about
