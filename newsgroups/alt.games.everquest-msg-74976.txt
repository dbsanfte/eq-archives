You simply have to make sure that you know the loot rules when you first
enter the group.  If it's FFA (free for all) for crap loot it's generally
understood that it also means "don't get greedy."

If you aren't getting your fair share simply point it out without whining
about it.  Something as simple as, "please leave some loot for me" should be
enough to get most people to calm down.  If you have a ninja looter that
didn't get your hint, send him a tell saying the same thing.  If he STILL
doesn't take the hint, get out of his group and say why you're leaving.
