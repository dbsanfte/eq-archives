I disagree. 
YECs can console themselves with the faith that they beleive in no
uncertain terms that God has outright told them he created the earth
not to long ago... and that THAT is what they are supposed to believe.

Perhap old bones are a test to see if we are faithful enough to
beleive the Word of God over our own eyes... 

I hate debates of faith... its inherently so arbitrary. (As the
natural rebuttal to the above would be that I am relying on my own
eyes to discern the Word of God in the first place... if my eyes are
suspect then where does that leave me.

Of course, if I was faithful enough... then I would "know" I'd
understood what God wanted of me...
