I'll second that.  My Wisdom was maxxed out long before my stamina.  
Currently, with no wisdom buff, I can easilly get my wisdom to my current 
cap of 315.  I am still one point shy of maxxing my stamina at 305 self 
buffed.  The number of times that I have run oom is so miniscule as not 
to be worth worrying about, running out of hp is, OTOH, guaranteed fatal 
(well barring DI or some such).  When I created my shaman, I followed the 
suggestions I saw online at the time, and put as much into Wisdom as 
possible, the rest into stamina.  I would have done better to reverse 
that.
