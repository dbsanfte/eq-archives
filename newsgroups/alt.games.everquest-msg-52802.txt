Befallen is currently (last time I checked) different on different
servers. The change was temporary, some haven't changed back yet. All
servers had befallen "advanced"...some just switched back sooner. As
far as I know, most only switched once or twice--newbie to advanced,
then, in the case of the ones which switched back, back to newbie.

In other words, none of the switches were simultaneous.
