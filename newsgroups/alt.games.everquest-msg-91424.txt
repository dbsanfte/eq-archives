Yesterday I was online with my sons 5th level Necro in the Qeynos sewers
trying to get to the other side when he was chased by a Piranah and killed
by guards when he tried to get away.  I calmly told him to get back on the
boat and return and I would drag his body near to the entrance.  On the way
he went LD when the boat zoned and because of the patch was unable to get
back into the game.  Today when he returned to get his body it was gone.

He and I both petitioned the GM (I thought coming from me he would know he
wasn't being scammed by some kid) and was told that there was nothing they
could do.  The best he could do was give him a leg up kit with a few clothes
in it.  I had just given him a good weapon to use and he had been given some
other good items by others.  Those items are now all gone.

I read here that all you have to do to get GM's to help is be polite and
state your circumstances.  Well this did not work.  The last time I
petitioned a GM they did not help either, that situation was marginal, but
this was clearly a case of the servers being taken down causing the problem.
Had they remained up, he would have had plenty of time to get his stuff
back.  The policy is that they do NOT restore any character under 6th level
for ANY reason even their own mistakes.  So the lesson is NEVER give a
lowbie anything worth while.

OH, by the way, the corpse decay times posted here a couple of weeks ago are
wrong.  Level 5 characters still only have 30 min online and 24 hours
offline.  Even though his corpse rotted on the dock for about 3 days about a
week ago.
