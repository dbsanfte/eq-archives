The farmer (forget his name) is still there (and presumably still
deathly ill, heh).  Honeyjum is still used in the Stein of Mogguk
quest (and others?).  But the Temple of Life guy is gone, replaced
by a duplicate Felodius Sworddancer (original hangs out in EK at
bottom of ramp to Highpass) dunno what quest he's for.  Aested (sp?)
was also involved in several other Temple of Life quests, so maybe
they just relocated him (haven't tried searching for him with a
tracker), but I think it's more likely he was removed because one
of his quests was part of some exploit, or somebody fucked up the
database setting up a patch and flagged his spot for the wrong NPC.
