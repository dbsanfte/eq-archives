Which begs the issue... why DO people kill guards? I know, they have good
swords/loot and the exp is great, but there have been many many times when I
ran to the guards as a low level newbie, and not finding them there would be
a point of pain (and not in a good way). Just exp? Boredom? Not high enough
in level to kill them myself, but I also can't *see* myself killing them. I
would be remembering the times I ran to them, not finding them there, and
died. Just wondering.
