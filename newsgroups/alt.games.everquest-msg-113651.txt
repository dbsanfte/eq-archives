I have played on several EQ servers, but Innoruuk is definatley my favorite.
(Which is where I am playing at the moment.)

Longest sitting... A few years ago when I was about 21ish, I went to
college, and had the whole summer off... I would often sit from 10am - 6-7am
playing. So, nearly 24 hours. Needless to say, I was a wreck after that
summer. ;o)
