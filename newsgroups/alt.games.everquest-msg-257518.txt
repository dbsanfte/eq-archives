During an LDoN last night, I mezzed the few mobs on one particular pull 
using an AoE mez. Two resisted, and as I was targetting the first to re-
attempt, the cleric dropped a nice heal on the tank, drawing the other 
particular mob's attention and therefore, a healthy dose of aggro.

The cleric immediately piped up with "Mez this one please."

I responded by following through with the already in-process mez and 
quipped, "Heal that one please," referring of course to the tank.

My point was noted and we both chuckled about it, although me while rolling 
my eyes. ;)
