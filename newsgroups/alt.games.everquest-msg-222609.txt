I disagree. Making non-critical aspects of the interface easier can't 
possibly be a bad thing, provided it's not at the expense of something 
more important.

I'm certain the various undercons in the game are by design. What the 
devs' reasoning might be, who knows, but establishing the level of a mob 
is pretty straightforward, I expect - some algorithm combining 
AC/HP/damage potential. Winding up with an undercon would seem to require 
intent. Maybe they want to avoid a particular mob being camped 
constantly. Maybe they do it for EQ lore purposes.
