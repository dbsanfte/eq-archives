What parts did you leave out then that leave me so ill-informed? I never 
said I had greater information than you, and I claimed equality more to 
make a point, not in actuality.

Never said "easily". Nope. Try again. Any guild *can* get past them if 
they have a) the necessary support network (adequate membership or 
alliances), and b) members with any level of loyalty and commitment 
willing to offer some assistance to guildmates once they get flagged 
themselves.

You just said yourself that my opinions are based partly on what you 
yourself have written (though I've yet to establish that in fact), so how 
is it based on ignorance again?

Read the testimonials of others in this very thread who were able to do 
it in much less than 10 tries (6 and 2 I believe) without such monumental 
circumstances. Read about how other trials are quite viable, yet so many 
people can't seem to look past the popular opinion that this one is the 
easiest to even investigate them.

So, you're saying that the only people whose opinions should count here 
are those who have attempted the trials then? *Very* short-sighted of 
you.

Nope. Didn't say that one guild member should be willing to flag an 
entire guild. Try again. If you can't understand what I'm saying, how can 
you possibly debate against it?

I normally play *with* guild members, so I can say that a good 75% of my 
time is spent with them anyway. Why should I require it all to be a 
positive xp situation for me? I think we're getting closer to the real 
issue here.

Then they have some work cut out for them, don't they? Give me a break. 
If people want the guild to help them, they should be willing to help the 
guild. In this case, that means going to the necessary lengths to better 
themselves so as to become an asset.

Once another tank *is* flagged, they are better able to do just that much 
more quickly and easily.

No one said it should happen overnight. Why do you expect it to be so? 
I'm not suggesting you just pick up any Tom, Dick or Harry, I'm 
suggesting you concentrate on bringing your guild more online with what 
is required for advancement. If I want to kill the AoW, I don't scream 
for them to nerf the mob so I can, I arrange for a larger party with 
which to tackle him.

/boggle No I'm not contradicting myself.(?!) Please quote where I said 
that I "want guildmembers to show up for every single trial event", 
because you are again putting (trying to put) words into my mouth. Your 
repeated attempts at that very tactic as well as your frequent 
misrepresentation of my views and comments is discrediting you.

You said yourself that it's all about DPS. Seems to me a 60+ ranger 
pretty well kicks ass in that department with that same warrior. Need 
more tanks to lessen the burden on that warrior? Well, where are the rest 
of the warriors in your guild? No more? That's a problem, not with the 
game, with your guild.

Why would he even come into *any* conversations regarding the trials yet?

Doesn't care for raiding? Then doesn't care to equip himself in a manner 
necessary for advancement of both themself and the guild.

These are not problems with the game. They are problems with the content 
and attitudes within your guild.

Nope. I'm not. Show me quotes where I have and I'll shut up about these 
so-called contradictions. Otherwise, at this point you're merely a liar.

If by "good" (your word, not mine) guild you mean adequately equipped, of 
sufficient level, loyal and committed to each other with enough members 
to constitute a decent raiding force, then you are correct. That's 
exactly what I meant.

That speaks volumes of you. It is *the* most ridiculous and grandstanding 
thing you've said in this entire discussion. How in the world could you 
possibly substantiate that claim?! *No one* in my guild is of sufficient 
level to even consider preparing for the trials yet. I believe the 
highest is 55. I would be more than willing to help others out. If we 
decided as a guild that our direction should be to rush to the trials, I 
would either agree to do my part or bow out. Right now, I don't see where 
it would be worth it to me to just fly through the next 20 levels just 
for that purpose. Then again, it's not exactly like I'm avoiding 
levelling opportunities as it is. Once I *do* get to 60 and get flagged, 
however, you can bet your ass I will be more than willing to help others 
in the guild do the same.

I just want something more than "you haven't been there, you don't know" 
to go on here that I can't really refute. As it is, I don't see where 
anything more than fixing the current system is necessary.
