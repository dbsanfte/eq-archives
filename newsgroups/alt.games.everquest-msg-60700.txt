You're missing the point. EverQuest removes you from the game if your ping
rate drops, instead of letting you catch up. I'd rather take my chances with
a little packet loss and some missed hits than to be removed completely and
left for dead!

I've played 20 or 30 other online games in the past 10+ years, and this
"link dead" implementation is the first I've seen. EQ implicitly disconnects
you, while other online games only disconnect you if you are disconnected
from your ISP.

On top of that, GM's will not reimburse your lost exp for your troubles!

It's amazing how ignorance allows you guys to put up with this bullsh!t. Go
on, keep paying $10 and let Sony keep *&^%#$ you in your *&^$!
