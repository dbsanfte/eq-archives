    	I'm not trying to start a flamewar, guys.  I'm simply looking at 
which one I want to start playing over Winter Break, because I don't have 
the time (nor money) to devote to both, so I want to pick one and stick 
with it.  That said, the general consensus from reviews is that WoW is a 
better game.  I played EverQuest 1 for awhile, and I eventually got bored 
of it at level 52 and stopped playing.  But at least I know what I'm 
getting with that route.  On the other hand, I've loved all of Blizzard's 
games and I'm confident that they didn't mess it up with this one.  So, now 
I'm turning it over to the players ... which do you think is better, WoW or 
EQ2, and why?
