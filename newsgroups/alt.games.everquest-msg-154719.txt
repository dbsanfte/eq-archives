No, I think its at its worst with any very well geared hybrid/monk

Guildie rogues who can tank uber mobs show its a more generic flaw with AC
than a massive problem with monks

All my class specific gear (or monk/bst, monk/rogue etc)-
gloves (epic)
pants
boots
weapon 1
weapon 2
robe
bracer x 1

My all/all gear -
earring x 2
neck (its about 4 classes on this)
mask
crown
rings x 2
bracer x 1
cloak
range
belt

I see that as our "real" AC level... not as bonus AC for being underweight.
The AC loss for being a few lb's over-weight is HUGE

I don't know, I guess I need a lot of logs to parse to find out

One things for sure though, theres no way in hell I could tank AoW.  Even
with the rotation setup on me, I really don't think Id last 10 seconds.   If
it came down to me being the only melee alive and a bunch of clerics, them
*nuking* would have greater chance of killing AoW than by healing me

How about make an FD thats actually bug free, for the first time in 3+
years?  Or the 100's of other quirks in the game
