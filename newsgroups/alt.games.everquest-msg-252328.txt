Erm the *account* has real and established value since you paid for
the cd key and are paying for it to be maintained, and just because it
was returned doesn't magically make it not stolen in the first
place...

Even if that were not the case, and we accepted your flawed scenario
at face value, you're correct in saying its not theft until its
established the items and plat (not the account) belongs to the player
not to SOE. Of course that's much different than "not being upset",
which means you're asking two different things here.

SOE tells us they can at will delete all characters on an account,
along with everything they have, just for being inactive for three
months. Even though they haven't done it, that tells you right there
who actually owns this shit. Let me know how someone would fare if
they challenged this, hmm?
