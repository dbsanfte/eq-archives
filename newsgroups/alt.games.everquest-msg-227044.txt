When I was still in Jaggedpine Defenders, they had a system of DKP, 
where everybody attending hte raid got a certain number of points, then 
for each hour of a raid you got a certain number more of points. When 
you went to use the points there were 2 ways to do it.

First, you could for 100 points call a raid on a specific target [though 
IIRC not for epic parts, those were handled by the epic coordinater] and 
muadd [raid leader] would schedule it into the raid schedule.

Second way was on rolls. frex, /ran 1 1000 being a default [example 
number, dont remember offhand what the typical rolls were] if you had 0 
- 20 DKP  you didnt modify the roll, 21-50 DKP you /ran 100 1000, 51-75 
DKP /ran 200 1000 and so on [sorry if i dont remember the actual random 
numbers]if you won the roll, you expended a certain number of raid 
points. you could bid raid points if you wanted to roll on something for 
an alt, and when you were out of DKP, you couldnt roll any further. 
though if a no drop popped that you were the only class that could use 
it, you got it and would be pushed into negative DKP and have to attend 
raids again until you were into positive DKP.

As a system, it was fair enough. the more raids you go to the better 
your chance of rolling and winning. Separating the epic content frm 
regular raids made sense, as at any given time there was always somebody 
needing a raid for something, and i remember 2 fairly long raids on 
PoSky, the first fighting all the way to the 7th island and the second 
someone camped a necro out to CotH people in. Was the most annoying and 
funnest set of raids and I would dearly love to go back just to do the 
cleric weapon quest.
