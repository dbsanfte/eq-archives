First of all: in any case people have rights even inside your house - such
as not be aggressed or hurt  (unless in response to a previous aggression,
of course). There are laws that apply even in your house, regardless of your
choices - at least, in the country I live in.

Second - let me make an exemple. I accept a rent from you to use my house.
At this point, I have no right to dictate the rules you must follow (other
than those explicitly given me by the laws, and maybe by our contract, of
course). My accepting payment from you has made it your home, though it's
still my house, and have moved the right to make rules from me to you - so,
paying may be important - in some instances, at least.

Third - another exemple, and more to the point. Let's say I charge tickets
for people to come to my house and hear, say, a conference, - or look at a
movie. In that case, I cannot turn a ticket owner out just because (e.g.) I
don't like his face; I cannot just arbitrarily decide to revoke his right
(of course there are several legitimate reasons for doing so) - and at the
very least I have to refund his ticket. Would you accept to be turned out of
a movie house because the owner doesn't like the language you're using to
comment on the film with your friends, or bacause you wear a pro-Bush (or an
anti-Bush, for that matter) T-shirt? By accepting money, the owner of the
movie house has transformed his place from a private to a public place; ant
the rules that apply have, as a necessary consequence, changed.

I wasn't criticizing Blizzard' decision as such, but the argument that the
mere ownership of a site justifies any decision of the owner. In other
words, I think that Blizzard may have been justified in suspending the OP -
but the mere ownership of the site is not enough to justify it. OTOH,
protecting the rights of other customers may be enough - if it's really true
that many customers feel the need to be protected from mere (and in this
case rather anodyne, IMHO) words.

Hope this clarifies the issue.
