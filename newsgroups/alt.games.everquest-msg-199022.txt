Invis is never 100% reliable, it will always have the chance of dropping at 
some random time after it is cast.  Shaman do not get a better version of 
invis, so get used to it.  Most annoying spot for me so far has been in the 
middle of a mushroom patch in Fungus Grove, at level 58 or so.  They made 
very quick work of me.  Fortunately, at 61, I can take lots of pleasure in 
tanking those same mushrooms.
