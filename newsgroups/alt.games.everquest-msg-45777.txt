Which is what you have outside of city areas.  Think of the commonlands
as sort of suburbs of Freeport but basically commonlands are part of the
freeport area so more built up which isn't unrealistic.  Now look at
Qeynos Hills, One merchant, Rathe mtns, an inn in the countryside and
gypsies.  Oasis one inn, one gypsie camp.  South Karana, two merchants,
only one sells food, and then not to everyone.  My druid had to use wolf
form to deal with Krag (or whatever that damn birds name was) 
Butcherblock merchants right outside the town gates, and then one
outlying merchant who doesn't sell food.  G'fay food merchants in
Kelethin and felwithe only, both in cities.  No food merchants in
Dagnor's Cauldron.
South Ro.  One merchant who charges through the teeth for everything.

Kunark not 100% certain here but you have the mill in LOIO and then
stuff by cabilis.  FV in town only.  OT you have the Evil Outpost and
then one lone merchant who sells to everyone.    

Food only seems to be on every street corner within the cities.  Not
sure what zones your going to that food seems so abundant in, but I
don't see it personally.
