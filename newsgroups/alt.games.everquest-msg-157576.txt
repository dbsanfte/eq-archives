She was L56, it damn well had better have been the 56 hammer.

Here are the times of her procs from our break-in and early fighting
at chef in sebilis, during that time she was jumping into pretty much
every fight we had, starting 3 seconds after her first Yaulp:
[19:38:58] [19:39:07] [19:39:10] [19:39:12]
brief break from fighting at 39:15, melee resumes and 25 seconds later:
[19:39:57] [19:40:01] [19:40:04] [19:40:07] [19:40:09]
[19:40:21] [19:40:25]
brief respite, melee resumes at 41:06 as we charge into the room
[19:41:20] [19:41:26] [19:41:28] [19:41:30]
she heals somebody during this time ("wounds fade" message)
[19:41:46]
another brief respite, cleric reenters melee at 42:10
[19:42:44] [19:42:52] [19:42:56] [19:42:59] [19:43:07]
[19:43:51]
starts casting CHeal at 43:58, brief respite, resumes fighting at 44:43
[19:44:54]
shortly after this she went into med/heal mode for a while as the
warriors were getting chewed up pretty bad by the DSs until we got
everything cleared and then pulled as they popped to prevent them
from buffing.  So, over that span, as best I can tell from my log,
the intervals betwen procs (counting only time spent actively in
melee) were:
3,9,3,2
28,4,3,3,2
12,4
14,6,2,2
16
34,8,4,3,8
44
18

23 procs in 233 seconds of melee, 12 of the 23 were 2-4 seconds apart.
I deducted nothing for casting Yaulp, which does delay Cleric melee
attacks, since that's what BattleClerics do.  There were some heals
in there, and I can't be 100% certain of the moment she engaged or
disengaged targets, but that's pretty close.  So, although my initial
claim was a bit off (there are a number of gaps longer than 11 seconds)
that's still pretty damned good.  Divide the proc dd damage by 10 and
you have a rough estimate of it's DPS, for that L56 Cleric on that
night anyway.
