As somone else has said, if you buy Planes of Power you will get with it the
original EQ and the thing will run right out of the box.

The best deal going, however, is to buy the EverQuest Gold bundle that
includes the original EQ, plus every expansion since, including Kunark,
Velious, Luclin and Planes of Power. It also includes 3 cloth maps, a pewter
figurine and a special edition of the Player's Guide. All in a nice gold tin
box. Great package.
