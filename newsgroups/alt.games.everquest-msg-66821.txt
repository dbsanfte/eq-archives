First, understand that I'm no hardware expert. That said, I've built
quite a few machines, including two just recently.

And to my considerable delight, it's actually a lot easier than it
used to be.

You'll be installing XP from a CD-ROM. Assuming a relatively new
motherboard and CD drive, the motherboard will actually be able to see
the CD drive as a bootable device (you may have to set this up in
BIOS), and the WinXP CD as a bootable disk.

So, build your machine, set the BIOS to read the CD drive as a booting
device, put in your CD, and boot up. Win2000 was a breeze to install
from that point, and I assume WinXP will be as well - just follow the
screen prompts.

Oh, and it never hurts to have a bottle of wine nearby. Just in case.
