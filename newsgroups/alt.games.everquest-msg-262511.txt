Not sure why this would have been bad. I'd trust the UN to count ballots 
a lot more than anyone in the US political structure in such a hotly 
contested race.

Should the US be:
A) A world leader
B) A world bully

A) entails acting responsibly, sharing, providing direction and 
assistance, and leading the world to prosperity, and prospering itself 
as a result.

B) entails pushing other countries around, demanding everyone give into 
whatever you want, beating small defenseless countries up for 
disagreeing with you, being petty to 'get back' at countries you can't 
actually get away with beating up, and of course it entails a great deal 
of sulking.

Unfortunately far too many American's arrogantly chose:

C) *The* World's Leader

Except that C) is not actually a choice. You can't decide to be *the* 
leader. It doesn't work. And the end result is that either the US can 
acquiesce and gracefully fit into the world in a leadership role and go 
with A)... or it can lash out and sulk and go with B).

"Lash out and sulk" seems to be carrying the day.
