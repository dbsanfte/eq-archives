From what I've seen, goods and newts share a lot of areas, and goods
seem to be smaller in number and power. Evils have their owns areas
essentially to themselves
(nek/ls/ec/wc/kith/sro/innothule/feerot/rm/lake rathe/all of kunark).

I play a newt and I kill anyone I can, however. And they sure do bitch
like they do on RZ when they get pk'd :p
