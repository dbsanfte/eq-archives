Last time I went to Chardok, I was grouped with two Paladins, and Enchanter,
a Druid, a 51 Wizard, and me at 55.  The 51 Wizard was the lowest level
person there.  When the wizard was medding, we never got xp, when the wizard
was nuking, we always got xp.  We got 50 to 75% of the xp.  I love wizards,
when they are grouped with me.
