Ummm...  The idea is that I would *prefer* to just pop than do ANYTHING.

As for /q screw that...  send a packet to the server on a /q.

As for anything else about it..  When their servers have problems or the net
is having problems or what have you and you go LD 2 or 3 times in an hour,
unlike your cable TV company, where you can call and shout at the company
and they will 'credit your account', you get nothing from VI for problems
they have with their systems or delivery.

I'm not asking for perfection but I am asking that they simply dump the
penalty for unstable connections...  Whether it is from their end or my end.
It would *add* to the game experience for me instead of my spending hours
regaining ground that I lost from going LD.

I'm not asking them to fix the connections just dump penalties for it.

And, yes, I would prefer that they allow for the guy who wants to 'cheat' by
pulling the phone jack/network cable, etc...  to go LD.  It takes between 15
and 30 seconds of no traffic for you to drop out and be LD so, if you can't
make it that 15 to 30 seconds, you are toast at full penalty.

comming back from LD, the game can tell I died that way.  The 'player
selection screen' shows me with shield and weapon but NO equipment.  i know
before even going into the game fully after a LD incident whether I survived
or not.

Sanity is optional...  You don't have to exercise your options.
