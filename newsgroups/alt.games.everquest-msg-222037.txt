Urm, Maybe I was atypical... I xp'd in iceclad, in kael, in skyshrine,
cobalt scar, wakening lands while doing the icy shackle quest (ok ,thats
stretching I know ;) ) and crystal caverns. It didnt seem lacking on that
front to me.

Ssra. Most fun ever. Beats the *pants* off other things... Much preferred to
TOV wing grinds (not ntov). VT... well, I actually liked VT, but I do accept
Im in a minority there. And I really didnt like the key. Shei, Rumblecrush,
Doomshade, Ripening burrowey worm thing in acrylia, Itraer... These were nice
easy to get to plentiful raid targets. Lots of racing, but that didnt make
it worse than before...

I hate ldon ;) I'm not saying thats typical, but... God, I hate ldon ;) on
the other hand I'm kind of enjoying the sense of space in some of the other
zones now. Which is nice ;)
