That's not the case.  I don't recall the original poster claiming to do a
/report.
I imagine the claim was granted because the claimant was nice, the GM/Guide
was in a good mood, and the corpse was either not very far from the known
bug spot, or quite a few others also died that day there, or there were lots
of petitions and this was simply the easiest/fastest way to get to their
next one.  Dunno, guides/gms do funny things every day.
