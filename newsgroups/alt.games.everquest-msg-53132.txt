1. Because the thread was started for the sole purpose of saying, "you suck"
Drake.
2. I was responding to Drake, whom I assumed would "get my point."
3. Also note that this is the first time I've ever responded to you Cam.
4. Also note my very simple outline format.
5. The excerpt had nothing to do with me.
6. The excerpt points out that there are truly insane people posting to
Usenet.
7. Children thinking they are "being funny or cool" by taking on "enemies"
and posting "you suck" posts and "taunts" and all the while, not having a
single clue about the "target" of their rant.
8. The original poster is incredibly naï¿½ve and believes he's anonymous.
9. The original poster is not anonymous.
10. The original poster doesn't have a clue as to how mentally stabile Drake
is.
11. This puts the original poster in jeopardy to one degree or another.
12. For all the original poster knows he could be inviting an axe murderer
to come on over and chop him in to little pieces.
13. That would be a bad thing.
