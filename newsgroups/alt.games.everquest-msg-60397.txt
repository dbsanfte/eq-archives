Hello-

I am a 39ranger.
I have been thinking about increasing my 1hs.  (very very low.)
My piercing is maxed and 2hs is at near max.

Question:

1.  Should I dual wield  1hs and get clobberd for awhile or should I use a
combo of 1hs and piercing?
2.  If a combo is recomended, which should I equip in which hand?

    The more I think about it,  the more scenarios come to mind and the more
I am confused.......

3. I realize that Fighting blues and up is required but do light blues help
skill level increase also?

I am sure I can solo to get a respectable level of 1hs skill, I just want to
make sure I am doing it in the most prolific manner I can..

As always I thank everyone for taking time for your advise.

    -kris.
