That's what the green spellgem means... anyway, it's like Christmas isn't
it. Look at the wonderful present we have. I think the Pallies should be the
happiest... they just became a pulling class.

A word of warning... when you get the resist-but-no agro with the Lull line,
apparently you still get a looks less aggressive message, or I did last
night with pacify (pacified 5 mobs, pulled the 6th, got two, nothing dazzle
couldn't handle.)

Here's you a neat trick:the cleric ghetto crowd control. Yes you can be just
as effective CC as myself, the wonderenchanter versus unmezzables.
root giant
pacify giant
atone giant
works till level 55 mobs. WoT doesn't work so well though, because its agro
radius is somewhat larger. What's really nice is when the Necro dots the mob
after it's locked down, it turns him into tomato paste, leaves you alone,
and if noone healed him, stops and begins behaving again (yes this happened
last kael raid I was on)
