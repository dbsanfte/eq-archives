Well untill you get lev 59 heal spells PoP is hell. The lev 51 Remedy is a
joke in the pop zones, but  you work with what you have So if you want to
cast on the chanter you may find yourself chain healing with Remedy, its a
real fast cast 3 secs but only 475 worth of heal. When you get lev 59
Ethreal remedy 975 of heal you will say notice it's not too hard at all to
keep a caster standing and with the Celestial Elixir  time heal you will say
Awww  the PoP zones are cake, no big deal. As far as CH healing gos, you
have to cast at 50 to 55 % heal to keep the tank standing a lot of the time.
The 2nd CH will have slow on it and its not bad. If you have a tank 2 or 3
not backing out and they are getting aggro too, then you have your hands
full. And remember if you have a puller that will not wait for mana, Always
Always let the son of a bi tch die if you can.
