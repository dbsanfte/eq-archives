I meant Veksar,its a one-way-route,not confusing like a real old
world dungeon like SolB,A,or Guk,if you have a closer look it is
very linear,with mobs getting consecutive harder and harder.
Get a group and try to reach the Highborn/Nobles area,then
you will see what I mean,its hard to explain.Its like the Everfrost
adventure,which is only a long corridor,with no branches.
