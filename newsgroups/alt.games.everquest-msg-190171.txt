Just copying the EQ folders over is not going to do a bloody thing, because
none of the registry keys or the files that get installed by EQ into the
Windows foler/subfolders (if there are any with EQ but there are registry
keys definitely) will be installed this way. Just install the files and use
your existing account id and password if you are going to simply use the
same account.
