listen up you people

my char is a level 8 ikky monk

i had to run through cabilis (was never there before, all my "/shout could
someone gimme loc of X"s went ignored)

from cab through LOIO - found a woodie druid, asked 1x ("could i bum a sow,
mate?") to which he replied, "for a leezard? NFW"

through FM -  no sow, no invis, just MY OWN FUCKING SELF

through DL - see above


and i get to the moon, and some idiot happens to lose some stuff (he never
asked for it back, hailed me, or responded to the very obvious "PC on these
items here which i've never heard of . . " which would give away i didn't
know jack about the stuff)



and you think there's some ethic here? i should be overly-nice to people who
haved screwed me? that's not ethics, that's christianity . .. or worse

explain how the "ethics" you're talking about makes your game better - do
you know people who help you? you DO? hey, do you help them? SAME HERE
jackass

do you know people who screw you? corpse camp you? rip you off, KS you,
train you . . oh you DO? do you go out of your way to give them 12k in
stuff? you DON'T do ya, jackass


ethics = all relative, so go suck me off
