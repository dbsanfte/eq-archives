Neeeh, never mind all that. What about the days when spells didnt have "worn
off" messages? Was real fun using root for runner control in dungeons in
THOSE days....
And no autofollow...
And breaking planes in Crafted and Yaks.....
Griffs spawning at the 'proper' rate in EC /chuckle
None of this new-fangled Root stacking with Snare/SoW (running to zone from
an Unrest Ghoul Train will never be the same)
I also remember when people used to get to the 40's by going to DUNGEONS and
learning the skills they will NEED on raids. Rather than just going
newbiezone->Oasis->LOIO->OT then wondering why they SUCK when they hit
Karnors for their first ever grouping/dungeon experience......
I could go on :)
