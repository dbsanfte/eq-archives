It used to be that the pet got the same aggro you would. So it
wasn't a matter of "can the pet kill the mobs before they kill
you", it was a matter of "can the pet solo these mobs
indefinitely". You could park the pet in the middle of the camp
and then go somewhere nearby, out of aggro range. As long as
your pet didn't die, and nothing else wandered by, you were
safe.

Mages with epic pets and muzzle of mardu used to be able to do
this with lt. blue mobs. Not a whole lot of XP, but you didn't
have to actually be there to do it. This is the REAL reason pets
no longer aggro.
