Okay, can't find the original post, so I'm piggy backing off yours,
Celaeno. ("shavenwookie.com"?!?)

On a related note, Busker, my bard is also half-DE. He's a
psychological mess. He was conceived during an invasion on a small
human village...through rape, of course. His mother was a follower of
Tunare, and raised him as such, but could only find shelter in
Freeport. Daddy eventually came back and murdered his mother and
half-sister, and hounds him in an attempt to "purify" the bard's mind.
He was captured, and subjected to a blood-purifying ritual that
removed the human traits ( I beleive there's precedence in AD&D
fiction somewhere ) and brainwashed into turning on his lover and his
guild.

Now, after coming to his senses, he's on a self-imposed exile. Of
course, now that he cannot hide his DE features, he faces hostility
everywhere he turns.

Anyway, off-topic for the thread, but related...since you mentioned
half-DE. ;-)
