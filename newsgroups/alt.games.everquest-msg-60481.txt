    Assuming your "ledge" is what we call "upper spiders", or "US" (the
place where the Frenzied spawns): from SH, go up the icy ramp to the right
(be careful!) When you get to the top, stay right until you're at the base
of an icy ramp and against the outside wall of Velk's. That is usually where
the US camp will set up. You passed the spawn point for one of the nameds
(Frenzied Velium Broodlin - they truncated the "g") on your way there. The
other two nameds (Crystal Eyes, Frenzied Velium Stalker) spawn on the level
at the top of that second icy ramp. FVS drops the Ring and the Axe, FVB
drops the Wraps and the Bracer, CE drops the Fang and the Shield (IIRC - I
may have the Bracer and Shield reversed). In addition, there's the usual
Crystalline Hunter random rare drops - last night I got Crystal Chitin Arms
from one.

    It's a bug, it's a known bug, but whether you get a res depends on the
GM.
