Please no... I don't want a vacuum cleaner attached to my computer (you
heard one of those FX's? sheesh).

Are not EQ2 and SWG using the same engine base? The rumor mill is they are
recommending Radeons for SWG.. the DirectX 9 compatible ones...

Btw is sucks that their package deal doesn't include SWG... I might get it
then.. as it is EQ is going in the can I'm afraid. Not that there's anything
wrong with EQ, I am just a Starwars geek at heart.

And no, you can't have my stuff.. I already know who I am giving it too
(what little isn't nodrop).
