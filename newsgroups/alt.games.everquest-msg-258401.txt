The data didn't support this, but personally I like to drive slightly 
faster than the average; this puts most threats in front of me, where I 
can easily see them and can easily deal with them by slowing down if 
need be, instead of by speeding up.

75 was, however, -more- dangerous than 70, and in fact no safer than 65 
despite the fact that the guy driving 65 had 2/3rds the people on the 
road approaching him from behind.

No, I don't claim this is support for the idea that driving slower is 
more dangerous; its just as you said, driving at a different speed than 
people around you is whats' dangerous.  If it was just a question of 
slower, than the data would have shown 70 as more dangerous than 80, 
when the reverse was true; 80 was significantly more dangerous.  But 
likewise going slower wasn't safer, going 60 was just as bad as going 80.

I also don't know that the same curve would hold true in other driving 
circumstances; the I10 corridor across the top of FL is perhaps an 
extreme example, and places with curves or higher traffic volumes or 
different driving experiences... or even just the new speed limits which 
supplanted the universal cap of 55... might show different results.

I do think its very funny to imagine what it would have looked like if 
someone had done a similar study but limiting their data to say 40 to 
70... that looks like a good wide range of speeds distributed around the 
limit eh?  Only the faster you go the safer you get!

Oh, I also have to reiterate that even though I say "dangerous" above, 
pretty much because you did and I wanted to continue with your thought, 
what I really mean is "risking accident"; the injuries distributed just 
as you would expect, the faster you were going in an accident the worse 
you tended to be injured... an accident occuring -at- a higher speed was 
more dangerous than one occuring -at- a lower speed; which means that if 
you were going 70 and -did- end up in a wreck you were probably worse 
off than the guy going 55 who did the same.
