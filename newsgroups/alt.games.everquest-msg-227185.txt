I have lots of hotkeys but in groups I dont use any of them even for CH. Its
much faster to just hit a keyboard button. On raids I use the buttons
because people have a tendency to blame the clerics for not healing if
something bad happens. If I dont use the buttons people tend to say stuff
like "well I heard this cleric doing stuff and this cleric doing stuff but
what were you doing" and that pisses me off.
