You have no idea how much it scares me when people *like* the ones I
made for a laugh... I believe I saw a vote for one of the pinks, too!

There's a chance I might go with that one. I'll probably give it
another couple of weeks to see if Feshlak will give me my boots and
then get a greyblue that matches those. Maybe. It's so much easier to
think of ways to dye my alts...
