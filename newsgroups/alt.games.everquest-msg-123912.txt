yeah its very good but it will also
have to have a powerful power supply
for the athlon geforce configuration otherwise
it will crash/lockup. Likely it does but the problem is 
that on burn in I don't know if very many companies use
an intensive 3D benchmark program, which is where you'll 
see the problems (or an unoptimized game like EQ)

You don't want to run the game in full view distance anyway. You see
just as far for the most part with no view distance outside, its only
3d object/Luclin interior stuff that it brings in for the most part.
To have your view distance at full in places like shadow haven is just
shooting yourself in the foot by using resources you don't need to use
while denying much of the advantage of Umbra (not rendering what you
don't see)

You'll still probably lag on 35 person raids some ;)

What is nice is you'll be ready for the much more optimized and up to
date Star Wars Galaxies, EQ2 and all that other stuff when they come
out. Compared to EQ/Luclin with all models and bells and whistles, SWG
should fly on a system like yours.
