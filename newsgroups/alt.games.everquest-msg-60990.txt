Trick for you on running:  Use the Ctrl-Left and Right keys while running
forward.  You run forward diagonally.  If the thing chasing you is slower
than Spirit of Wolf running, with out it, you can out run them.  I did it
with my barbarian.  Never got killed by a Vengful after figuring out that
trick.  Same with Orc Pawns with level 1 chars at the newbie area in GFay.

What you can't outrun are like the Orc Shaman in Everfrost (they have SOW)
and others of that ilk.  They just flat outrun you and can keep up.  Jumping
uses up stamina WAY to fast so don't use it if you can avoid doing so.

Best of luck,
