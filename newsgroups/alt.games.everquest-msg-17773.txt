I've never been sure how they managed without pulling their hair out.
As a mage I have my pet in there dishing it out.  I try to exercise some
mana discipline, I tend to hang between 50% and 80% mana (gotta
save that half bar to burn something down quick) and rely on my pet
to carry my share of the damage on easy kills - Wizards don't have
that luxury.
