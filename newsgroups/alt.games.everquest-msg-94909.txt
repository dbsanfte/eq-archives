Something consider in the future...   Setup a hotkey with /assist on
it (you'll want attack on assist turned off in your .ini file for this
to be effective).  If in doubt about a mob, hit the hotkey, that will
switch it to whomever the mob is mad at - if anyone.  If you get a
player, hit the key again and see if he has that same mob targetted.
If so, they've 'met' at some point and best to ask the player.  If
not, the player may have accidentally aggro'd the mob and is running
with his skirts in the air for a zone.

When pulling, I frequently use the /assist hotkey before engaging a
mob.  Seems like you can see mobs from a long ways away, but don't
always see players that are right next to it!
