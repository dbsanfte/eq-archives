   It was nerfed, then got un-nerfed, maybe on accident.

   Personally, it would be fine with me it they did nerf it again.  People on FV
are putting a +4 vs Cold aug an item they want to sell, then jacking the price
up 2k because it's augged!   And the constant spam of people wanting to sell or
buy points in /market is annoying as well.  If/when they do re-nerf it, there is
going to massive amounts of teeth gnashing.  As well as a few giggles.
