A further follow up on this - the previous poster
didn't post enough of the relevant patch message

"Zone Experience

The first and perhaps easiest to explain change that we are making to the
experience system is the modification of what we call the "Zone Experience
Multiplier", or 'ZEM'. Currently, every creature in game of a given level
yields a fixed amount of "Base Experience" (experience before it is
allocated to group members). That base experience is then multiplied by the
ZEM which is set to a value in correlation with the risk in a particular
zone compared with the reward; at least, that is the goal.

....

In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several
underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is, increase the
amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone.

As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in
the following zones:

Droga increased by 12%
Nurga increased by 12%
Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13%
Najena increased by 13%
Befallen increased by 13%
Paw increased by 13%
Permafrost increased by 13%
Kaesora increased by 18%
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20%
Runnyeye increased by 20%
Kerra Ridge increased by 20%
The Hole increased by 25%"

Note that these were INCREASES to existing ZEMs
