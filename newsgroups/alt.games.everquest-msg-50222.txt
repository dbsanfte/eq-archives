I don't play off-hours...I'm usually sent tells from strangers asking me if
I'm looking for a group.  I'm not a high elf snob, so I rarely go /role and
I'm glad to get group requests, even though most of the time I do my best to
avoid pick-up groups.  I usually get 2 or 3 tells in a three hour period.
If I'm actually looking for a group I do /whos for guilds that my guild is
friendly with to see if they'd like C2.  It's odd, but most of the time they
say "hell yes!" <g>
