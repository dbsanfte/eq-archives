What "problem"? As new items become more readily available and the
novelty wears off, they become cheaper. As they become cheaper, they
become more accessable to those who have less money. yes, those who
sell the items are getting less money off of them, but other items are
coming down in cost as well. Where's the loss?

NOTHING is going to make, say, the Velium Round Shield return to
300+pp value now that it is so easily available and commonly seen.

Again...where's the "problem"?
