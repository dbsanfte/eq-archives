I used to have the same opinion of them.
I've never bought money/items for eq, or diablo2 which I played for quite
some time. ive *always* been interested in selling plat though but stayed
limited to friends who at an off the wall moment decided they wanted ornate
(or in one case.. a  selos drogmor)


Well, alas. I have a hard drive that has been acting up for some time now
and decided to give mysupersales.com a go. sold them 180k last night for
122.40 and ordered my new hard drive about 30 minutes later. expecting it to
arrive next tuesday or wednesday.



So now my attitude towards them is.. when I needed the money they were there
for me.   the game economy? yeah.. its fucked. but there doesnt appear to
anything to be done about that, so may as well take advantage of it. shrug.
