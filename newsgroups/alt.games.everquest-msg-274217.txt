ooo...at least I didn't have a racist term in mine ;)



So you have been playing WoW?
How have you found it so far?
Most questions that are asked about it here are met with flames....I was
wondering how it played compared to EQ.

I have enjoyed playing EQ2, in a nice guild and playing with plenty of
people in my time zone which is a treat.
We also use teamspeak which has been heaps of fun, and much easier to yell
than type RUNNNN =)

I was put off playing by the normal version where you are an orc.....is it
pretty much different character race selections like EQ?

=)
