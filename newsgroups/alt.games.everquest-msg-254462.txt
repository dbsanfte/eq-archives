About 4-5 days ago, I was on one of my characters in PoK just hanging
around doing nothing, when I get a /tell from some total stranger
saying something like "I need some extra cash so I can buy armor and
spells.  Can you help a sister out?"  I do a /who all and it turns out
to be a level 3 human druid (who I will call "Beggar01").  

Instead of my usual response to beggars of "all I can give you is
advice--don't beg", I decide to share some of my (admittedly limited)
knowledge of the game and tell Beggar01 about certain mobs in certain
newbie zones that drop items that sell for 1-4 pp each, and how one
can get several hundred platinum saved up from killing such mobs (I
didn't even get started on the other usual moneymaking items like
spider silks, etc.).  Anyway, Beggar01 thanked me a lot for this
information, and I was pleased that I was able to help a newbie player
on the path to a productive and profitable "career".  

Then last night, I was on a different character, again in PoK, and
then *that* character gets a tell--"I need some cash for some armor
and spells, can you help a sister out?"  Yep, it was Beggar01 again!
(who was still level 3, by the way!)  I just rolled my eyes and
/replied "sorry, I'm pretty broke myself" or something like that.
