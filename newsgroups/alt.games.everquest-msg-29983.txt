Long as you don't get down to your last bone chips I have never really found
it to be a problem. I thought dread corpses dropped them too<?>, but there
are so many spawn points with decayed skeletons, skeletons, putrid
skeletons, and the spawn rates are so high you have little free time between
[click undead, /pet kill, loot]^n. I'd have to check, I think I have about 8
stacks of bone chips in my inv and bank right now.
