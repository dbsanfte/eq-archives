Ah, but in no FPS can you enjoy any kind of AI close to comparable to

It is a game set in a fantasy world. Those who so nonchalantly
disregard this by putting a superficial spin on various aspects of it
detract from it.

The fact that some people insisted on doing so on day one changes
nothing.

I do like the people and I have no problem with the majority of things
they say. As a matter of fact, the only reason this thread has reached
this length is the fact that some feel the need to convince me I have
no right to this opinion. I don't shun anyone who uses the term
"wizzie". I never said anything of the sort. Do I consider that in
forming an opinion of them? Sure, but to a very minor degree. That
could never be the determining factor one way or the other. Everyone
has their own pet peeves. This is one of mine. I certainly don't lose
sleep over it though.

You yourself state that they are used to convey something. What is
"wizzie" meant to convey? Nothing.

The average person using the term "wizzie" is meaning to convey
nothing. It is just the term they have come to use for wizard.

No I'm not. It may be subtle, but for many I believe that explains it
very well.

You see, that's where you couldn't be more wrong. You assume that
everyone else just naturally strives to be cool as you do. I have no
interest in that at all. I don't really care what others think about
my level of popular acceptance. Why should I?

Sorry. It's the only explanation I can think of for a person doing it.
Anyway, by "either" I was referring to the "posing and clowning" many
feel the need for as I mentioned above. I didn't mean to imply a
reference to you. If you insist on taking it that way, I would just
say that if the shoe fits, wear it. Otherwise, please take it as it
was given.

Nope. We are just being shown more of it. The world is still meant to

Of course I don't expect that any more than I expect world peace. That
doesn't keep me from wanting it that way.

There *was* a reason. I was trying to convey a sense of juvenile
superficiality. Seriously, you're taking pot shots now.

Or, better yet, I will continue to enjoy my favorite game immensely
even though some of the otherwise quite engaging people might use
terms for which I merely don't see a need and would like to see
avoided. It is really not that big a deal in the first place, but it
*is* something of which I'm not particularly fond.
