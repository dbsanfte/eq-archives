They dont' pop up at random, and they actually run slower than players, so
they're not that dangerous.  Yeah, they hit for around 200 and proc a
dispel/dd, but if you don't get hit more than once or twice, it's not a big
deal.

More dangerous IMO is the velium hounds, they hit for around 150, but they
run faster than jboots, I can barely outpace an unsnared hound at 60 with
Spirit of Eagle.

If you're non-kos to CoV,then the only things in zone you need to watch out
for (none of which see invis) are the velium hounds, and the named velium
hound Icehackle, Tsiraka (named wyvern on GoV/NToV faction, kos to all),
Esorpa of the Ring (on kunark RoS dragon faction, possibly kos, possibly
not), Guardian Kozzalym (kos to all, level 55 elemental, CoV are social w/
him), and the giants that spawn when someone triggers the scout Charisa /
benevolence quest, well, and of course the ice burrowers.
