My necro is only around level 10...never been able to gather enough interest
to get him further, so I'm not going to try to sound like an expert here,
but I'm PRETTY danged sure that if you're just going to 'tap a critter for
health regen after you've dark pact'd yourself for mana regen it's about as
mana efficient (maybe less so) than a mod rod.
