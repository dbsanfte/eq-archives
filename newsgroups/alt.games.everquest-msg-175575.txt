Ok,
 I did a search on the web.... (Google of course) and all I came up
with is:

Zone                          Mod        Level
 
 Droga                        12%  	35 - 45
 Nurga                        12%  	30 - 45
 Guk (guktop)             12%  	  4 - 25 +
 Solusek's Eye          13%  	35 - 50 +
 Najena                      13%  	12 - 30
 Befallen                    13%  	  7 - 25 +
 Paw                           13%  	26 +
 Permafrost                13%  	15 - 60
 Kaesora                    18%  	30 - 45
 Qeynos Catacombs 20%  	  1 - 15, 33 - 38
 Runnyeye                 20%  	11 - 30 +
 Kerra Ridge              20%  	15 - 35
 The Hole                   25%  	40 - 60

Now... this list seems like its incomplete.
I've recently hunted in the Solusek's B and the exp there seems much
better than in various other zones.  We all also know about the
awesome exp in Pauldner Caverns.

So, what other zones do you feel should be added to this list, and
what level range would they cover.  (level of the monsters, like
eqatlas lists em)
