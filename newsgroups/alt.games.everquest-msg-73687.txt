Yes, another one of *those* threads.
<sigh>
Good friend of mine recently joined our guild. She feels she's been a
little slack in keeping up with her kit as she's advanced in levels. (40
Human Wizard) And I'd like to give her a hand if possible. Problem is,
not sure what to reccomend or help her to obtain to improve. Here's her
current kit.

Primary Melee: Glowing Black Stone 
Secondary Melee: Stein of Moggok 
Ranged Weapon: Frozen Orb 
Ear: Batskull Earring 
Ear: Batskull Earring 
Neck: Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet 
Face: Sheer Bone Mask 
Head: Nightshade Wreath 
Shoulder: Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl 
Finger: Rose Velium Engagement Ring 
Finger: Rose Platinum Engagement Ring 
Wrist: Drake Scale Bracelet 
Wrist: Polished Bone Bracelet 
Arm: Gatorscale Sleeves 
Chest: Crystalline Robes 
Back: Mystic Cloak 
Feet: Kobold Hide Boots 
Legs: Mammoth Hide Leggings 
Waist: Braided Cinch Cord 
Hands: Imp Skin Gloves 

Any thoughts of stuff that she could either camp with the help of a full
group of low fifties, or could be purchased in a reasonable (less than a
couple KP) range?
Thanks.
