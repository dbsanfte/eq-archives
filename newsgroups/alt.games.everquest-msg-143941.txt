Critical hits were originally a warrior only trait.  At any level past 12 or
so, a warrior had a chance to land a critical hit for double(ish) damage.
Or if they were beserk, a crippling blow for triple(ish) damage.

At some point, paladins become able to land critical hits on undead, I
think.  I'm not sure since I retired my paladin some 2 years ago, before
this was added. (if it was).

All melee classes, including paladins, can learn the Alternate Advancement
skill "Combat Fury" which gives up to a 10 percent chance of landing a
critical hit (on anything.)  Prerequisites for it are level 55, and 6 points
spent in the "General" ability section.
