Ayep this is true.
However, the times when this actually happens is relatively rare.  In
most cases, you'll be grouped.  When grouped with a shaman, you have
STA buffs.  When grouped with enchanters, you have Augmentation line
(which means you don't lose sta).

Again, at lower levels, this isn't as big of a concern since in most
cases you won't be swinging very heavy weapons very often.

No, that stacking I'm aware of.  You're talking about a lower level
version of Focus.  Combined with Mortal Deftness it's 110.  Combined
with Avatar, it's 150.

It's a fair chunk of mana for what is a precieved benefit.

You missed my point.
First off, the items which are available with right click effects are
extremely limited.  Those which do make an impact are either nerfed to
hell and back (donal's bp, heal stick from VP, nuke stick from VP,
etc...) or have other equally brain-damage restrictions (usually
stupid bottlenecks to obtain said item).  

Usually, when some item is discovered and the effect is known, most
experienced players can tell you when something is gonna be nerfed to
hell and back.  When the Velious quest BP was first discovered for the
clerics (I believe it was Celetial Elxir), pretty much everyone in my
guild knew it was gonna be nerfed.  You don't put a mana free healing
on an item without SEVERE restrictions.

Second, in order to raise your DEX "high enough", you end up trading
critical stats like hps, haste, +ATK, AC or maybe even resists.  The
latter set of stats ARE significant.  It has a direct and noticeable
effect on the combat mechanics.

The only stat you can't easily raise with items is STA.  At later
levels, you can obtain items which give +hps/STA but that's not until
you get to 50+ range for the most part.  At least for warriors, for
hybrids it appears to be slightly different.

That has very little to do with Dex benefit.  It's more to do with
VI's brain-damage of letting a weapon from a level 63+ mob proc from a
level 1 character (that's probably a bug but more than likely won't be
fixed).  Probably the reason it hasn't been nerfed is because the
weapon in question isn't that great once you hit the higher levels.

Fine, use those spells and check the logs.

Keep in mind something:  VI won't allow a spell to radically raise
"significant" stats.  There's very limited amount of AC, hps, and ATK
you can raise through spells.  Avatar is the single biggest +ATK buff
in the game and it's expensive as hell.  And there's a reason for
this.  Allowing people to raise these stats significantly through
spells will make encounters easier (damn near trivial actually).
Remember, when it was possible to stack all druid skin lines and all
cleric resolution lines on a single player?  It was possible to raise
a level 60 warrior's hps to over 7200hps and near 1700AC.  Once that
stacking exploit was made widely known, it was nerfed with the next
patch.

Why?  Because that extra little bit of AC and hps (two stats which
DOES make a difference) made encounters like Tormax significantly
easier.  

There are some +ATK buffs, but most are self-only spells for just a
handful of classes.

That +ATK is why many rogues even ones with primal and vyemm's fangs
will still opt to use their Freebringer instead.  The +40 ATK is hard
to beat from an item effect.  This is also why every rogue with a RB
wants it equippable in the range slot (give the +ATK but you can use
better ratioed weapons as your poker).
