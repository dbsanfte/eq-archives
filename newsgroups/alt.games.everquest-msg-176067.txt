Very possible I think. I may be the archangel Gabriel, the scholarly one who
is 2nd in command of everything, but not responsible for anything.

You can tell an angel from a normal person based on how animals, children
and same-age members of the opposite sex react to them. Which is to say that
all animals will love them, children will recognize them as one of their
own, and if you are a male then women who do not recognize God will reject
and in some instances try to destroy you as only they can.

Anyway, this could mean something that I have long suspected, that Jesus is
probably on Earth right now in human form, and I think I know who it is but
I will not reveal that to you as we will find out in the end anyway.

All I will reveal to you now is that the old Jesus came as a lamb to be
slain, this one will appear as a lion emerging from a wall of blazing white
fire, with only one purpose, utter annhilation of Satan's kingdom which will
be cemented in place in 3.5 years and destroyed 3.5 years later.
