If I don't have to be on a server where this occurs, it might be ok.
However, what's to stop someone transferring to such a server, buying
godhood, then transferring back?

Also he says there is a "200 million dollar  market worldwide". This sounds
incredible, and may be total fluff. Ok, let's assume $200 million dollars.
No police. No laws to stop you.

 I'm not a criminal, I don't know how to exploit this, I don't want to
exploit this. However, many people are not as nice as I am and for $200
million, they would eat their own children. So far as I know, there's been
one killing over money in a MMOG I know of. IF the market is really $200
million (a big if, but I'm using plain text, so please add a few font sizes
mentally) AND law enforcement doesn't get involved THEN people are going to
die.

People get whacked over a few grand, and it would be so easy to launder
money etc this way. I've heard stories of mexican eq sweatshops, with people
grinding out the same mobs over and over for plat... I wonder if this will
become reality if it isn't already? And would they like to join a union?
