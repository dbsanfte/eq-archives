itll put a number up next to the channel you joined. For instance if you
were to make a chat channel named: noobz , you would type /join noobz . It
would then pop up with the message : You have entered noobz (1).
If you want to talk to people in Noobz all you have to do is type /1 then
your message. If later you decide to jump into the global auction channel,
but still talk to the guys and gals in Noobz. Type /join auction. A new
message will pop up saying "You have joined Auction(2). To talk in acution
type /2 and to talk to the Noobz type /1 etc.
Hope this helps.
Also you can find more about chat commands in EQ by typing /help chat
