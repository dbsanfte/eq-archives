Greetings all.  I went looking around on various Nvidia sites and newsgroups
and can't seem to find an answer there, so I wanted to see if anyone here
was having the same problem I am.

I recently installed an MSI G4MX440, 64MB card in my system.  The Geoforce
4MX 440 doesn't seem to like EQ very much.  I can log my monk in, and the
game will be instantly frozen.  Same result at varying times with my other
characters, but they all lock up within a few minutes of logging in.

I'm debating swapping the card out for a G4 TI or a G3 TI at this point.
Don't want to spend the extra money, but I'm running out of options if I
want to play EQ again apparently.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

DBB
