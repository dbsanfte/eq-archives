Bad idea - you can in fact put multiple songs on a hotkey
but you're locked into those songs until the hotkey plays
out (bad if you need to switch to charming an add), also
it doesn't take missed notes into account.

What you want is a social for each song slot of the form

/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast #

The pauses need to be adjusted for your lag conditions,
and the # is 1-8 for your songs.

This reduces twisting to 1 keypress per song, and you've
got the timing to turn it off and have the songs refresh
built in.
