Perhaps if you are just talking in terms of "usefulness to others" for
raids, groups, etc. but as far as enjoying the character and exporing
new options, I'd have to disagree. Level 29, and even more so, 34, are
*huge* milestones for wizards, and seem to change the whole game for the
player. (And it's a change for the better, I might add.)

Yes, I dinged 32 yesterday and hope to be 34 early this week. (Circle of
Force and a bunch o' new ports/gates) Just call me a quad kiting fool.
(Ok... actually you can call me a "usually dead or running for his
freaking life from a quad gone bad" fool.)
