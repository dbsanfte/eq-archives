There are several things going on here.

If you have 6 groups in Crushbone killing things normally, then they 
aren't killing each others's mobs, and they might as well be in seperate 
zones except for where they start stepping on each other's toes.

If you have 6 groups in Crushbone with a chat channel, sharing buffs and 
helping each other out a bit, then its sort of a raid, but its still 
more a mass group activity, sort of a guild fun day.

If you have the 6 groups working together, so that you get 36 people 
killing the same mob, then those mobs die much faster... but only one 
group gets the exp each time (frequently the same group, the DPS group). 
  This is how raids used to work, shared effort, single groups getting 
exp... but since the principle point was to get the loot to drop off 
really hard mobs, the exp was considered beside the point.

With POP, we got a "raid" mode, where the 36 people can link up into a 
single extended group, and all the exp is shared, sort of.  Trouble is, 
the exp that is shared out doesn't get any grouping bonus, and tends to 
suck desperately, you'll be lucky in most raids to get enough exp to 
make up for one 96% rezed death.

We usually use the word "raid" these days to mean going into raid mode 
and killing with the massed power of a large number of people, in order 
to get high powered loot.  Probably we should invent other words for 
getting large clusters of people together in a single zone but in 
seperate groups for exp purposes, since the mechanics and results are so 
different.

Grage, 39 berzerk, raid free since birth... oh no wait, there was that 
damn raid on Acrylia Caverns
