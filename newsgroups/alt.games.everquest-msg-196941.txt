I've given up on Stromm (for the moment).  Too crowded for my taste.
It'll be worth another look in a few months, I think.

However, I think I have to delete my 12 mage on Stromm.  A long
slave caves session in CB devastated my factions.  The slaves kept
aggroing our group for some reason.  We never did identify the
exact reason.  The faction hits were worse than we imagined and
several don't look easy to fix.

I wonder what's going on with those slaves.  We were very careful
to never touch them, and they aggroed anyway.
