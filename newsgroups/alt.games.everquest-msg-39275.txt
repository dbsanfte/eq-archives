I am pretty sure (not 100% without checking) the blackened alloy is 1ac
better than banded, at least in the slots I have pieces for on my new
rogue. It's a pretty nice 20's replacement for banded, IMO, especially
since you can take a group there at the appropriate level and hunt for
it while getting exp.

I prefer the mega +sta on the darkforge for my DE SK, plus most of the
pieces have higher ac (not sure about all without checking, but the
breastplate for sure). Strength has little value, as I am not close to
being encumbered, and it's effect in battle is negligble. I also value
the Darkforge higher since I quested for it, and I think it looks great,
I like the full plate look. Sorta puts the 'knight' Shadowknight. I
admit, for bracers I went with Scavenging and Hero. I had a Ry'gorr
bracer for awhile, but I didn't like the look of the bright colored
chain bracer clashing with the rest of my elegant darkforge. Now I just
look like a Christmas elf with my green plate forearm and red
helm/gauntlets/boots =).
