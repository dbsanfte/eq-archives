No.  Almost certainly they'll do the same thing they did removing the other
hell levels, and you will log in at the exact same place bubble / level
wise.   If you were 20 percent done with 56 before, you'll be 20 percent
done with the new 56 now.

Some people will get free exp (those just about to enter a hell level), some
will lose a little exp (those just done with a hell level, or in the middle
of it), but it will prevent some unpleasantness.  Imagine if they didn't,
and one orange into 59 on the old curve came up halfway done with 58 on the
new curve.  (Since 55 - 58 will be longer to make up for a shorter 59)....
the cries from those that un-dinged would be deafening.
