My necro is only level 25, and at this point I don't have the
knowledge to speak as an expert on the class.  However I do know that
when soloing or duoing on red cons, (the only way to go), I have to
recast my snare at least once, and sometimes twice.  (Unfair
comparison at early levels though since Druids have to wait to get
ensare as well)  I also know that if I had my choice, I would take a
14 minute, or even 3 or 4 minute snare that costs less mana and does
no damage over the darkness line.

Druids have a huge advantage when it comes to charming, for example. 
A druid can snare something, then charm it.  If charm breaks, so what?
 Every few fights, the druid just has to cast invis, resnare, then
recharm.

Also, as someone else just pointed out, Necros can mez.  But the Necro
snare just messes that all up.
