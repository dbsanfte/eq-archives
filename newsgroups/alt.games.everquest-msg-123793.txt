This happens to me a lot too.  Especially Shadowhaven, sometimes Great 
Divide.  I'm frequently dual boxing, and have both my characters in one of 
the same chat channels.  If I turn /announce on on PC #2 and zone into SH 
on PC #1, about 50% of the time, after about 2 minutes, PC #2 will show a 
message that the character on PC #1 has left the chat channel and I'm now 
moderator.

Then it'll hang there forever.  And, no matter how long I wait before 
resetting PC #1, I will -still- be 1018ed for about 5 minutes when I get 
back.  Humbug.
