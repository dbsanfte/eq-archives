Another, albeit old and tired (LOL), thing to do upon hitting 34 are Ulthorks
in EW.

There is a spot on the NE area of the map (IIRC) where you can find Thorks and
Walrus at any time day or night.  Quad those, the weapons and armor are Vendor
Trash but sell for a few plat each.  The tusks are the real treasure.  For
every 4 you collect and turn in to the otter king in CS you get some random gem
or jewelry item that sells for several hundred plat.

So the money is fairly decent and the xp is very nice until around...  39?  I
think it was 39 that I noticed a real drop off in xp there...

Good luck in your druiding!  =P
