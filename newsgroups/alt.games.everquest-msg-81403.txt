Get thee to Crystal Caverns Brother Monk!!!

I cleared 1.6K in loot there between 43 and 46, and I was only
grinding exp. It is Monk heaven! Vendors with food and bandages (you
must sneak to buy/sell), and a bank right there in the zone. Mobs drop
up to 2-5pp per kill with lots of gold and silve. There are also some
very nice equipment drops (Crystal Covered Shroud 12AC Robe with some
+stats, Foreman's Cap 8AC Head piece with +stats) for Monks. Get in a
small group and camp Geonids for gem drops. Focus Gems can drop gems
that sell to vendors for up to 160pp. You can stretch the zone to 48
if you don't get bored hunting there :)

At your leve you could easily farm SolA for finesteel and pp, but not
much exp.

Go to www.monkly-business.com and read up on the zone guides and
message board.
