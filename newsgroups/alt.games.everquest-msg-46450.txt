Good post...

I haven't given in but I will not pretend threats are not out there. I will
do as I feel is needed for my family. The whole purpose of my point was
awareness. Not only of what you can do (limited) but what we as a nation
need to do, and what we should be expecting from our government. I will fly,
drive, continue my daily routine regardless. But I will expect defense to be
augmented. On a higher level as well as providing options for the individual
family. If you think the terrorists have beaten me, I have news for you. I
am simply adapting for my family. And that is to be expected. I would be a
poor parent not to pursue that...
