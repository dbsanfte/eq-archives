Not only for tradeskills... all skill increases get harder as you 
approach 250. It used to be that it would take me around a minute to max 
out Meditate whenever I levelled, with a wisdom of around 150. Now, with 
a wisdom of 215, it can take me one or two play sessions to max meditate, 
or even my most used casting skills, like Alteration.
