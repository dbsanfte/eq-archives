    He's trying to define a global MQing etiquette that both minimizes risk
to any one party and spreads risk to both parties. Over time, using Dan's
method minimizes the damage from flakes and fakes.

    Backs. He was on my server, sigh.

    You begin to wonder if he really got off on inflicting pain on folks. He
was running this scam about the same time another scam against rangers was
running on my server: people in EC were doing the "You trade me yours now, I
trade you mine later" scam, but specifically offering a Tolan's BP for a
PSC. A fair number of rangers I know got offered a Tolan's for a PSC.

    The best possible thing to do with illicit EQ goods is "wash" them as
quickly and as often as possible: trade/sell them in EC, then trade/sell
what you get a few times, all on a mule. Keeping them on a mule for
re-distribution "when things cool off" or to EBay (direct sale for cash
outside the game) is quite risky. The easiest thing for the GMs to do is
look for the item you got scammed out of, and if it's on someone else then
they have to go through long, tedious logs to figure out what happened to
it. By the time they've traced it back, you have had enough time to EBay
stuff or slide along a slice of the profits to friends/your main account
during the numerous trades and make it look legit.

    Conversely, if you are the scammed get the GMs involved ASAP. Tell every
friend you know to put the scammer on their friends list and check
religiously for him online, and if they come online send whatever GM you can
find a direct tell. If you don't catch them before they recycle what they
stole from you the likelihood of recovering what you lost diminishes
rapidly.
