No reason it wouldn't - they don't have to be equipped to use
the reclaim effect.

If you do this - go after the stein/shovel/torch/broom set first,
as they are the slowest item to get, and which you get first will
determine which you go after.

Check out http://www.magecompendium.com for the full quest details.

Of course, reclaim energy is based on the HP of the pet - 
mana returned = HP/10 to be exact - so your hammer is only going
to get you 10 mana back Lance ;)
