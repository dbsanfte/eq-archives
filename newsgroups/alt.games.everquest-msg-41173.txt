Well, Im on the swing shift at my command and headed in to work.  I am
nowhere close to what has happened but let me give you a snapshot of how my
little world has been affected:

Base Stores: Shut down
Schools in the area:  Closed, i had to go pick my kids up and was stopped at
the door where they radioed in to get my kids to come out front...where they
had to visually ID me as "Dad" before they could go.

15 min drive to work much longer due to increased threat condition....

Noone outside, recommended to stay in doors.

While i am glad for the increased security, it is still disturbing that my
life can be uprooted DIRECTLY by something like this...Something i accept
due to being military.  Keep in mind that increased terrorist attacks like
this may lead to more measures like these for the general public.

Putting my uniform on, ON MY OWN SOIL, should never feel like painting a big
bulls eye on me.

Try to make the best of your day all....my thoughts are withh all of you who
have been touched by this tragedy.

Steve
