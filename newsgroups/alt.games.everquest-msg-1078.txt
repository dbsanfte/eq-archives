18 Bard?  Go to Kunark.  Travel to Firiona from Butcherblock, get 
bound in FV, then go north to Lake of Ill Omen.  If you wish to 
group, do it here.  I personally did my 18-20 grouping at the 
goblin mines in the northwest corner.  Do that until you get your 
invis song, that will make the next part a lot easier.

If you wish to solo, go through the goblin mines into Warsliks - 
with speed (and particularly invis) you should be able to run 
right through.  Just enter the eastern entrance (which is just a 
hole in the side of a hill, not the main western entrance) and 
take every right turn.  In Warsliks go northwest to The 
Overthere.  Get a bind in the Overthere, and hunt the 
northeastern corner, particularly around the waterhole.  You will 
find nice white and yellow catci, rhinos, tigers and sarnaks 
wandering around.  The ONLY thing that will aggro on you are the 
Sarnaks, and there isn't too many of them.  Overthere is a 
kiter's dream come true.  There's even a beta-neutral merchant 
standing next to the lake so you can sell off your heavy loot at 
indifferent prices.  Don't go too far south, though - there's red 
stuff there.  This will take you through 22.

Experience comes very quickly and easily in The Overthere.  It's 
so easy there it's almost cheating; my 21 necro was getting 
nearly a full bluebub of exp from each "dangerous" blue mob!

Those blues tap out at 22, so go back to Lake of Ill Omen and 
group at the Sarnak Fortress.

By the way - by the time you read this, you will no longer have 
an experience penalty for your class, so you will not only be 
getting much more experience, your groupmates will not be losing 
any to you.  You should have NO trouble getting into groups now.
