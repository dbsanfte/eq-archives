Yes... after you punched 47 holes in it with your laser rifle you think 
you should just put it on? How uber. :)

What else would a monster have? Giant iguanas with lightsabres and flak 
jackets??

IMO the best loot system would involve no-drop items from top end 
content that were repaired/processed and augmented with tradeskills. 
With lesser items being directly tradeskilled. (Note that I do not 
beleive the owner of the pistol needs to be a tradeskiller.. I'd provide 
a mechanism for people to have their no-drop item 'tradeskilled' by 
someone else, and i'd make the final combines with the tradeskilled 
augments no-fail)

I.e. the *best* pistol in the game is an end-game no-drop item, repaired 
& then enchanced and augmented with consumable tradeskill 
items/accessories/etc.

You don't want regular tradeskilled items to directly be the best item 
in the game because then there is no point to fighting end game 
content... a newbie with enough cash can be uber-equipped. Boring.

You don't want the best items to be pure loots... because then there is 
no point to tradeskills. Why spend months collecting ingrediants and 
practicing... if something you can just camp is better and renders your 
entire tradeskill obsolete. Even more boring.
