I'm just about to hit level 10 and I will no longer respawn with all
my gear when I die. What happens if I die and I am unable to get back
because of ISP problems, power blackouts ect ?

Is there anyway faster way to travel between cities besides running ?
I got a newbies mail delivery quest to deliver mail to highpass from
qeynos, it took me about 90 minutes to run there.

I had been using a kitchkin sword (or something like that) that I
bought for about 3pp. Yesterday a guy gave me a fine steel longsword
which I see sell for like 65pp. But it doesn't do anymore damage than
my old sword that is worth about 20 times less. What's going on with
this ?

I managed to buy all the 1st level ranger spells except tangling
weeds, where can I buy this spell ?
