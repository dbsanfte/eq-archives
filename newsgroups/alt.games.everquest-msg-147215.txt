There used to be a lot of hawkers and conmen trying to push their gambling
scams in EC Tunnel a couple of years back on Prexus... for some reason, it
tailed off for a while. I'd be sorry to see it make a comeback.

My guess at the reason for its comeback?
Folks have, by now, sold all the junk that's accumulated over the years and
Bazaar bargains are getting harder to find. There's no margin in
'speculation trading' where you buy something cheap that's being auctioned
in GFay and try to sell it at a mark-up in EC.  There are fewer people
selling cheap that just don't know the value of what they have when they can
use the bazaar to pricecheck. And also, with the /Trader function, people
are parking mules and going AFK, so there's very little chance for
part-exchanging items if you're looking to upgrade.

Put all those together, and I guess you get a few people who really need
cold, hard, cash to continue buying anything... and they'll try anything to
get it... except for the obvious kill-loot-sell :o/
