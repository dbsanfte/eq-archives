If I understand your paragraph there, you misconstrue my point.

No, you changed the question.

I said they should spend some time in jail to cool off. Then you
asked if I was in charge would I send them to jail. Not the same
question, nor the same thing. They are two different instances.

Kinda like saying I game in Freeport all the time, then asking me
what its like in Kelethin.

That paragraph is completely off the subject, way out in left field
far away from what I said.

All I have really implied/said is Sony needs to work on its customer
interaction skills. Probably the only way to get them to notice
their custimner interaciton skills need work is a time out. Sice
they are probably too old, past age 18, to make them standi n the
corner, overnight in jail will work just fine. And part of customer
interactions is fixing bugs in a program before shipping more
product. They are making the same dumb mistakes as Microsoft.
