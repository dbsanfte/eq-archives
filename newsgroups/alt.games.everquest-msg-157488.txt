I have a 50 druid and a 51 iksar monk, and was hoping to find another good
spot to fight. The area next to grim forest/ten mountains was great for a
long time, but it's greening out, and my monk is not doing so great in the
dreadlands as he was a level ago (prenerf) and I'm still struggling to
scrape up the cash to bring his ac in line with monks who are doing ok. I
found the plague skellies in dl are fine, but it's really boring killing the
same mob ad infinitum, with basically no loot, and i was greatly hoping
someone knows of another two-box place?

I've looked at eq atlas but it doesn't seem to have anything for that level.

I don't realy want to kill guards (unless they were evil, i suppose) as i
sort of roleplay my characters (would do more of this but eq roleplaying is
pretty bizarre).

On another note, i learned that wolfform is not a good idea in dreadlands.
Gore ate both my characters. (500 points/hit) I don't know why wolf form
seems so hated in many zones.
