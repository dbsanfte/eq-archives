I've never tried the following, but it's worth an attempt, especially
on the long camps.

When you settle in, do a /who (to get a count of people in the zone),
and immediately after type /report <your guild name>aaaa.

Every hour thereafter, /who for the count, and /report <your guild
name>aaab, aaac, aaad.....

As far as I know, /report doesn't care if a name is actually that of a
character; it just wants a name to associate with the text.  Guides (I
believe) are able to look at the /report file.  So you have, in their
own logs, a nice, orderly set of markers showing how long you've been
there, how many people were in zone, and the names of a few of the
people.
