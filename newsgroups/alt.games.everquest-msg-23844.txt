I was on eqtraders.com today and didn't notice anywhere to buy fruit,
berries, or vegetables. Is there anywhere to buy these items?  I know
these are foraged items, but there is one place in Rivervale to buy
veggies.  I'm an aspiring brewer with a skill of 62 and now have no
way to increase without foraged items.  I've made friends with a
ranger, but he apparently doesn't have a great skill and thus I still
haven't gotten a full stack of any of these things.

Also, if anyone has cheap ideas on how I can get my brewing skill
above 100 without these (or kiola nuts, i've died three times trying
to get these, so I've given up on them) I'm all ears.

Thank you,

Gwinaxath, Tier' dal Shadow Knight
