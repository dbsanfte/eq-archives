Well, I got past the bizarre downloading error and, proverbially, I 
find myself tossed from the frying pan into the fire. The patcher 
loads, the splash screens come up, the server selection screen comes 
up, then the world begins to load... but then it all goes horribly 
pear-shaped, as the game crashes to desktop, always at the same point 
in the load progress bar (and, speaking of bars, in the same bar of the 
Everquest theme music).

Is anybody else also experiencing these or similar crashes? I'm going 
to pore over the crash log, if there's one, to see if I can find out 
more. Then again, maybe I should take this as a "go to bed" message 
from beyond.
