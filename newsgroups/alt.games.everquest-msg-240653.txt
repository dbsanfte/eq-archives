This happened to me  quite recently, I found I was getting kicked back
to server select when I zoned into certain zones. It was due to
certain ports being blocked (Each zone on a server is given a certain
port number which changes following a server re-set by SOE)
I did solve the issue after finding it WAS NOT due to re-patching zone
files, checking my ISP wasn't blocking any ports, checking my
anti-virus, firewall and adsl router were set correctly.
The problem was that I did a driver update from MS for my network card
and for some reason the network authentication option had become set
(this apparently effects ports with network access). Unsetting this
stopped the problem
