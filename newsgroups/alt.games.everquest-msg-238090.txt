My experience with LDoN adventures in the 50s (from 50 to 57) is that
normal risk ones are trivial unless your group are morons, and I'm
always doing pickup groups so it's not like I play with people whose
playing style I'm intimately familiar with. And it's not always
"optimal" groups - druid healer and no slower except me (bard) isn't
much if any harder.

I guess if you have a group with poor healing and poor dps, it might
be hard, but just about any full group should be able to deal with at
least the mid-50s adventures, unless of course people are complete
morons.

I suppose they may be harder than level 65 normals (it's uncommon that
I finish an adventure in less than 45 minutes, and it seems level 65
people often do), but they're not hard.

I have yet to manage to convince a group to do a high risk 50s
adventure, people are afraid of them.
