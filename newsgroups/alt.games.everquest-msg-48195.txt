hmmm  don't think that would be considered bannable. You pay for a
service, gates, rezzes, etc.  This too is a service. Or in this case,
you pay for the privledge to be eligable for a prize.  I would say as
long as it is official and don't screw anyone it would be allowable.

However I would document EVERYTHING. And ideally have a web page set
up for it, showing winning numbers, who was in, who won and all that
crap.  Do the rolls in public.

Now charging real life money is completly out of the question.

Maybe try a "pick two" type of thing. Just roll 0 to 99, let them box
and all that stuff. And everyone would at most have a 1 in 100 chance
of winning. And if boxed would be 1 in 30 or so.
