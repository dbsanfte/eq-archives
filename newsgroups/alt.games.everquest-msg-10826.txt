You just agreed with him and explained why. He was saying that warriors a
belittled as easy characters to play, not that they were not useful to a
group.
It is really the druid and necro that suffer from not being required in
groups as much, almost everything a druid can do can be done by someone
else, better and Necro's have the least group friendly spells although,
saying this, providing each is played well they are still a bonus to any
group. I've had Necros take over as healers and although the Druid maybe
jack of all trades, master of none, to a group, it means they can support
almost any role needed.
Warriors suck because they cannot solo like other classes, that is their
downfall, it is done to balance the game, if a 35+ warrior was able to stand
toe 2 toe with an equal level mob then you would only need to Warriors and
Clerics (to reduce down time) as it is now,  you must group and all classes
will help that group.
