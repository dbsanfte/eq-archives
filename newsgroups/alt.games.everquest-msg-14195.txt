No debate here.. feign dead power levelling works just fine. :-) I did it 
quite a bit in FoB, and also in the giant fort in WW. The 'trick' is that 
the 
other person can't hit or cast on the mob before you FD. And, he/she needs 
to 
wait a second to make sure that the FD was successful, and to make sure the 
server knows that I've feigned. There were a few times where my wizard 
friend 
started casting too soon, and I got the exp even though the mob died after I 
was feigned. There might also be an issue with the mob not running away from 
low hp when you feign. So, it's a little complicated, but if you pick the 
right location and the right mobs, it works really well.

Now, I'm not sure about mobs over level 32. Since they don't always forget 
you 
when you feign, you may not be able to PL that way.
