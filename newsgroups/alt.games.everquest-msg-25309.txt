My necromancer grouped at orc 1 in the commonlands the other night. There was
six of us, two tanks and four casters. So the tank pulls a load and we dispatch
them pretty easily. Next pull and about 3 pop and join the fray while we're
fighting. My pet bites the bullet and the next thing i know an orc centurion
and a leggionnaire are aggro on me, beating me around like a rag doll. I dont
want to train the two on another caster so i just flap around waiting for one
of our tanks to get them off. my health is going down seriously and the tank is
busy finishing off 1 other centurion, im not sure where the other tank got to,
he didnt die. All but one of the casters are standing around doing jack, the
one is throwing heals my way while im taking a beat down which is prolonging my
life by about, oh 10 seconds. I die and am not happy.
IMO, the role of a tank is to dish out damage, take damage and protect the
casters. I had half mana while the orc was killing me but i didnt have the time
to get a fart off let alone a spell. The tank had over half health and should
have aggro from all the mobs, thats his role isnt it? I was unlucky to be
attacked but the tank should have jumped in and got the orcs off me, i know he
saw what was happening because i circled the group about 3 times waiting for
assistance. And if not the tanks then why not another caster? they could have
occupied the mobs until the tank finished whatever the fuck he was doing, sure
they would have lost health but it would have prevented a party member death.
As a caster i need protection in a group otherwise im just a punch bag and as
far as im concerned i was thinking of the group by not training the orcs on
anybody but they werent thinking about me. The other casters threw no damage
spells, ok they may have been oom but i thought a good caster rarely utters
those words.
Now, thats my opnion but i dont have alot of experience in groups so am i just
being a whining baby over this or was this a bad group? I solo alot but i do
enjoy being in groups but as a caster i rely heavily on the tanks and when this
happens it puts me off the idea.
