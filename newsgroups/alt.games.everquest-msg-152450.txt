Well, it seemed to me that my question/suggestion had about as much
relevance to the world-as-it-is as yours did.  I'll admit that it's
hardly my most clever attempt at sarcasm, but it reads a lot better
when you don't snip the text I replied to (no doubt that was your
intent).  I respond in a more serious vein elsewhere in the thread.

Your post read as a complaint (aka "a bitch" in the vernacular) to me.

A fine thing to do, just don't be surprised at how other folks
respond in a public forum.
