Actually, a BST can solo all the way to 65 with "average" or even
mediocre equipment...

Anyway, race doesn't really matter all that much in the end except for
aesthetics. Might be slight perks from the Trolls or Iksar because of
the regen bonus (and slight AC boost for the Iksar).

If you want to be "common as dirt", go with Vah'shir. :p I feel silly
for not expecting it, but had I known they'd be such a stupidly common
race choice for BSTs, I would have picked another race.
