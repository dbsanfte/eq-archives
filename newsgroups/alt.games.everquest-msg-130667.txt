My only contention is that the Palestinian Terrorists specifically
target civilians and non-combatants...

Example, the Palestinian gunmen who entered a private residence and
gunned down a mother and her three children, ages from 5-12.

Note, the security officer killed was NOT a terrorism killing, as he
was a combatant..
