Possibly because they're frequently used when things are *not* hectic -
basically from pure laziness.

I've spent a lifetime reading English text, and as with most native
readers of English I read a word at a glance rather than letter-by-letter.
Use of odd abbreviations bypasses that and adds an extra step required
before comprehension. It's quicker for the writer, slower for the reader.

Common abbreviations gradually drop into the word-at-a-glance category,
but simply assuming that the reader will have acclimatised to that extent
is unwarranted. The word "you" has one meaning. "u" can have several,
depending on context.

The "common abbreviations" I don't class as d00dsp34k, but their use does
say, in a milder way, that "my time is more important than your time".
Speaking for myself, I can usually live with them. But they are irritating,
and I avoid them myself except when things are *really* hectic. I recognise
that this puts me in a minority, but I'd rather be in a minority that cares
about such things than the majority that doesn't.

It *is* a fairly minor issue, I'll agree, and it's not something I
complain about in-game. It's just irritating. Whereas full-on-use of
d00dsp34k is waving a flag saying "IDIOT HERE! AVOID!"
