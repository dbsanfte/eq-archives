*Top post fixed* (In the future, please bottom post for easy thread
reading, if you would.)

Quad kiting is the same as normal kiting (not fear kiting... see above)
except that you do it to four mobs at a time keeping them in a tight
group while they chase you so you can hit them with Area of Effect nukes
that will damage four creatures at once.

Oh, I shouldn't say ".. except that *YOU* do it..." because "you" won't
be doing it with your necro. Only wizards and druids quad kite. You
don't get the area of effect nukes required to use this technique.
