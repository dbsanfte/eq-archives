Yes, but farming that is shitloads easier than farming leather padding.

Edited for Clarity:
blessed sickle blade = sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence,

(trivial 183)

blessed sickle pommel  = sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence,

blessed sickle hilt  = sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence, ruby,
blessed dust of tunare, mistletoe temper, hilt mold   (triv180)

Mistletoe cutting sickle = blessed sickle blade, blessed sickle hilt,
blessed sickle pommel, smithy hammer (Stats are 1HS, 8/22, WIS 5, mana 20,
sv magic 5, wt 5.4, DRU/ALL, recommended level  20) (triv 250)

Brewed: mistletoe temper = elven wine, celestial essence, mistletoe 136

Make poison skill, in a mortar and pestle, but no fail: celestial essence =
celestial solvent, high end research component (and I recommend buying Scent
of Marr because it is available in unlimited quantities)

Pottery skill, in a kiln: Blessed Dust of Tunare = imbued emerald, celestial
essence, jar of acid (triv 103)

Yes, you can keep making the one part over and over until you get your magic
number. Looks like the blade is the cheapest one, even if it's two emeralds.

As for paying someone else to do the little combines for you, that's up to
you on how much it's worth. If mistletoe is like other alchemy ingredients,
they are probably roughly 3pp each.

Hope that's clearer.
