Lance is right. (Assuming hes saying the opposite of what you just said..
the above is wrong)

If the mob is blinded, and in agro range of nobody, it wanders around
aimlessly (I think its actually a set path.. the same way for fear, but
thats a different story)

If the mob is blinded, and stumbles into a group of kos players, it will
automatically attack them.

Example, when I need to split the first 2 mobs on Tormax ramp, I will chain
cast blind on one of the giants.  A lot are resisted, but 1 will stick soon
enough.   Of course both will agro, but once they have left their "spawn"
spot and i FD, 1 will return home. The blinded will walk down the ramp way
(and walk into the group)

If you blind a mob on its spawn spot and instantly FD tho, he won't move at
all.
