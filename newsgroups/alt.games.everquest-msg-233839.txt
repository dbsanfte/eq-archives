As a druid quadding wyverns I can make 2k per hour from wyvern hides and 
gems, although one does have to sell the hides in Bazaar.  Downside is 
it is a bit like Rather Mountains  - too many people after too few mobs, 
although the kill stealing of Rathe Mountains is rare.  Oh and the XP 
was good right up to L56.
