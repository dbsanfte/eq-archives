I don't think it's any secret that EQ is two very distinct games. End 
game and everything else. Personally, I'm not thrilled with some of the 
differences, but I can certainly see the reasoning behind them.

Would I like to see better gear available for the non-raiding players? 
You bet. Should it be as good as that which is attainable through large 
raid-size encounters? Certainly not. That said, I do agree that the 
difference between the caliber of each is a bit too substantial at this 
point.
