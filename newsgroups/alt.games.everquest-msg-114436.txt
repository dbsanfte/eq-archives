After you have reached lvl 60 what else is there to do? Besides
1. getting extra gear and money for a "twink"
2. beating your chest 
with all of the lvl 55+ it looks like verant could do something to
make reaching 55-60 more exciting. What if verant made it so.
1. You could pvp any other 55-60 player that isn't in your race.
2. make a NEW server just for high level players :)
I think a new server would be good, you could have your choice either
to put him (her) on a pvp server or a regular server.
