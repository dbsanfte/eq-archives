That's always been kind of touch and go... about half the quest mobs will
take a stack of a maximum of 4
a few I've seen will take all 20
the rest (more than 30-40 percent) only take one at a time.
Also if they want 4 of something , you have to give them separated. But I
did the wine quest to offset a little naughtiness I got up to that got me
down from ally with the neriak merchants a week or so ago.
