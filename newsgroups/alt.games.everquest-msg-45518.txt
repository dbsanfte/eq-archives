Been a while since I have done the quest but I have seen lord Grimrot within
the past 2 weeks. I seem to remember the Ph ( Standing Putrid Skeleton north
side beneath the covering) being on a 3.5 hours spwan. I you kill PH in the
AM say around 7 the next will be a night spwan or Undead version. To get
Live version kill PH in the evening. It took me just over a week to get both
logging on  at the camp every 3 hours as best I could. Sometimes he was
camped but I could at least see when he or the PH was killed so I knew the
time of the next spwan. BTW I was very crouchy that week.
