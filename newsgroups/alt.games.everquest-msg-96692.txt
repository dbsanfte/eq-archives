Yeah, that sounds right.  Was running visable last night from Charkdok to 
Seb*, had a fair number of mobs try and snare me, all were resisted, 
though I think level pretty much explains that.  I really can't remember 
ever being snared, but it must have happened some time.  I know it's 
happened on my twinks...though I suspect my target selection was MUCH more 
conservative as an un-twinked, pre-kunark bard.  :)

* Silly cleric didn't know the way so I had to lead, 150 second 
Selos much better than Song of Travel in that case.
