*shrug* It's very rare that I feel in an RP mood when I'm in EQ. I'll
RP when others are around me, but I don't usually initiate it.

I generally ignore people I don't get along with, because they annoy
me. I play on FV, and I don't see much RP. But I saw a guy the other
day with the name 'Aelian Invaader'.

Well, MUSHing is like a book. EQ is like a movie. Books/MUSHes leave
much of the visual details to the imagination, whereas movies/EQ show
everything. For me at least, a literary experience is more satisfying
than a visual one.

I don't have problems with LARPs, but then again, I've never been in
one. Not really my thing.

Plus there's the fact that the MUSHes I've play on all have an
approval process for characters. You have to apply for characters,
rather than just having them automatically. Really cuts down on the
amount of dickheads, which there seems to be a lot of in EQ. Plus
certain aspects of EQ are counter-productive to roleplaying. By the
time I got done typing 'Is that the Lord of Fear appearing over yon
hilltop with all his retinue?' the raid would be wiped out :)

It's really kind of interesting... the term for
dickheads/powergamers/munchkins/bad roleplayers in the MU* community
is 'twink'. Calling someone a twink is probably the worst insult you
can give without swearing.
