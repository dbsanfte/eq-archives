I do fully agree variety of toughness is great it was just that as a solo 
player I spent three days finishing attempting tidying up many quest and 
generally got about zero xp despite some  tough mobs.

Personally I think greys with up arrows should still give a small bit of xp 
if one or two lvls out of green.

There seems a small lvl change between  some tough commonland battles eg 
rhinos^^ elephant and tamer^ orc mason^^ tower maiden and then they all 
becoming greys.

One moment good battle next moment the game is telling u no move on (perhaps 
a good thing) but it is also saying this may be a tough battle and use up 
all your power and an add or two may kill you but do not bother as you are 
getting no xp - hunt around perhaps for ages to find something not too hard 
but not too easy.
