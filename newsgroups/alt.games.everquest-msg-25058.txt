    So what you're saying is for most people it DOES take time then, yes?
Since most people do NOT have the decent understanding of game mechanics -
they either need the gear, or more time, or more time spent reading all the
sites telling them the things they need to know to be more efficient.

    That's pretty good - I don't know many folks who were still at less days
/played then levels at level 55. Heck, most were at 55 days before Kunark
came out - are you estimating time spent levelling, or using actual /played
raw data? Also, note the standard you use - days /played, not actual RL days
it takes to get the levels. For most people I'd guesstimate there's a factor
of six to convert between the two (amongst players who play a character to
55 or more).

    That's a highly misleading comment. I'll take my own armour set,
Ethereal Mist, as an example. Before Kunark, Helm, BP, Legs, Arms, Gloves,
Boots were all strong, bracers were OK until Bracers of the Reverent were
upgraded and crud afterwards. That's six of the seven possible pieces. After
Kunark, the only commonly available replacement for any of those items is
Donal's Arms - and those get swapped out in raid situations for EM and the
magic resist. (Some low STR clerics use them as well, but I'm going to
ignore that.) So now FIVE of SEVEN pieces are still strong. After Velious,
the only replacement available at the same levels, with the same time
investment as doing planes raids, are Gauntlets of the Black - so four of
the seven drops are STILL STRONG.

    I did a quick scan through some of the other class armour from
Fear/Hate, and found the same thing - every set had one "dog" piece from
pre-Kunark, and lost at most another two post-Kunark to cheaply available
Kunark class armour (INT casters excluded from survey). So over half the
armour dropping tended to be either an improvement (like Woven Shadow
Bracers adding ten points of resists and some STR), or a marked improvement.

    That's a neat idea. Was it to cut down on /gu spam during raid periods,
or just to clearly delineate who would and would not be able to attend the
"top level" raids?

    And I doubt they have ANY gear passed down from their mains.... ;-)

    I found Kael farming to be tremendously slow in terms of drop rate,
especially when paired with the gem requirements before you could actually
obtain any armour. Do you folks do anything to mitigate that factor for the
junior team, or do they farm/purchase all their gems themselves, too?

    How much actual time in front of the computer is that, though? And what
about folks who DON'T have a guild of 58+ levels essentially PLing their
faction? Now, compare that with the time required to get Fear/Hate drops.
What I'm saying is this, Sang: I'm a level 46 warrior in full crafted with
Fine Steel in appropriate slots, and the one Kunark armour piece I can
afford to purchase as well (for a WAR, likely Gauntlets). I think I should
go to Hate to get some Indi BEFORE doing Velious or higher-level Kunark
camps like Sebilis. Are you saying I should go to Kael Arena instead?
