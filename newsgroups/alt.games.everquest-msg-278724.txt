I agree with the thought but I'd have to say I certainly don't consider
25ish (by then they're pretty well unique) "fairly late in the game."
But I'd certainly agree going up to around 15 mind-numbing and
I've no idea why they decided not to just differentiate the classes
at level 1.   About the only thing it does is force awareness that a
fighter is a fighter, even when they're something else in 15 levels.
It's just a *tedious* education.

Of course they supposedly have plans to increae the EQ2 level
cap to around 200 eventually.   In that light playing to 20 isn't
that big a burden...
