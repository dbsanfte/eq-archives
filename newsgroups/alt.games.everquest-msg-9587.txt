What a terrible shock it would be to a suspicious wife.

"All this time I though you were looking at pornography sites, and now it
turns out you're a... a....bizbee baiter."

Or applying for a job;

"You know we don't allow bizbee-baiters in here, son. We think it's damn
Un-American, so if you have done anything like that, best speak up now"

If anyone does look at it 5 years from now, they will still be able to tell
that you are a silly old fart
