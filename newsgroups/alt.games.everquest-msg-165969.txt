I've had the same email address since 1995... I doubt there are any spam 
lists that don't have it by now. At this point I don't particularly care 
anymore, since I'm better served by using Bayesian filters (like in the 
Apple mail app, or in the latest version of Mozilla), that catch spam 
with an uncanny accuracy, than I would be by trying to disguise it.
