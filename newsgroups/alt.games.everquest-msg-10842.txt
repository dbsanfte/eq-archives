I seem to recall reading that these mobs are on Bertolluxus faction.  So
if you find or start a character who worships Bertox you might be able
to walk right into camp to drag the corpse.

A friend got hit by these and (I think) used invis to drag the corpse
out.  You can get someone to cast it or buy invis potions from vendors
in most cities, though they aren't cheap.  Or just start a level 1 rogue
in some nearby city and use hide/sneak to walk there (it'll take a
while).  /consent the rogue and drag your corpse out.  

>      So what do you do in this circumstance?

Log on another character that has the necessary skills, /shout Paying
for help with corpse recovery, or ask friends or my guild.  I've also
used the drag-and-die method once with a mob that was red, SoW speed,
and able to see invis.
