Guess what, we're back to chain killing low blues again.  You might also try
actually reading the discussion leading up to a statement, wherein this was
all in regards to the warrior going LD and the ranger finishing the fight. 
In that case, particularly if my advice about which heal when was heeded, a
CH is a CH, whether it heals 2k or 7k.

Great, so you thought that 10 minutes out of every year was worth a whole
side discussion?

"If the normal mana fluxuation is even less than 10M we could go up to 90M"
because god knows that if we pull one mob and spend less than 10M we
*really* need to be ready for the puller to go pull nine times that many at
any time...

Not surprisingly, I'm not arguing that that's not safer.  I'm saying that
preparing for the puller to go pull 9 mobs when there isn't a single place
in the dungeon that will bring more than 5 mobs for even the worst puller is
attempting to be far too safe.

By the way, I lost two adventures over this past weekend.  The first was a
collection mission that was barely lost, in spite of the pace I set.  I
don't think anybody from that group wanted me to go slower.  The second was
a pickup group where I would swear the paladin group leader read this thread
and was determined to prove me wrong.  Much to the paladin's chagrin, we saw
firsthand why "slow and steady" does not win this particular race.
