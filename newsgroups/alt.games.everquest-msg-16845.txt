I agree with the other posters that her actions were deplorable and that its
not exactly "common" to find one so self absorbed.

As to gating to avoid loss, I'll gate when its obvious the situation is
lost.  As the cleric I can quickly tell if there are too many mobs.  I'll
exhaust the majority (90% or so) of my mana casting Celestial Heal and such
(low agro heal over time) while telling folks to run.  But when I'm at 10%
and there are still 4-5 mobs, and the tanks are starting to drop, I'm not
going to sit there and go down with the ship.  I gate out, and run back to
start the CRs.
