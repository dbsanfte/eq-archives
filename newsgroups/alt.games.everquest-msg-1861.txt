This is probably one of those often asked questions, but I can't find an
answer to it...

Has anyone noticed that if you type in "everquest" in IE's url box, that it
starts the game?  I've yet to see another program that starts up by typing
its name in the browser. Strange. It does this on two seperate machines that
I've tried it on. Usually typing in a word in IE will go to IE's default
search engine.

BTW:  Been playing the game about 2 months now, and I've gotta say that I'm
just sorry I didn't try it out a couple of years ago :)
