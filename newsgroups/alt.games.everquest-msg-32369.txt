OK, since you're obviously an idiot, let me explain this one more time.

I'll even outline it for you:

1.  My university does not offer access to Usenet.
2.  I created my Google account long ago (using my hotmail account to avoid
spam) so I could continue to read Usenet (or at least part of it) from
work/school.
3.  When I posted from work the other day, I used Google.  Obviously, it
wasn't caught by his KF.

I assure you that it was not done on purpose.  Not that I really care,
because you're basically worthless to me, but you're beginning to annoy me
so I thought I would make another attempt at getting my point across.
