You petitioned yourself the last time you were fighting a mob and you
resisted a nuke and it tried to nuke you again, right?  It obviously
shouldn't behave that way, and your taking advantage of it makes you a
cheater.  It also will make you a dumbass when you respond to this and try
to claim otherwise.  :P

I defy you to find documentation on *exactly* how *anything* in this game
works.  I take it as I find it, and assume it's "working as intended"
whether that works for me or against me.  It far more often works against
me.
