	It's bullshit.  You can use this kind of warped logic to justify anything
a player wants for his character.  Bottom line, the primary purpose of a
priest class in a society is ministering to their parishoners, and as a result
they should not have "mundane" skills like Tracking.  "Sense Animals" is as
close as they should get -- there's your "in tune with nature" bit.

	Irrelevant to the point.

	Don't be inane.  After about level 40, the only use for Tracking in
routine play is checking to see what's spawned, and Druids and Bards do that
just as well as Rangers.  Druids are actually more likely to spot rare spawns
in a typical group because they spend less time fighting and have more time to
check the list.
