I've seen a GM summon an Ogre (or Troll I forget) away from the bank door
in Kelethin as this person had somehow thought it worthwhile fixing faction
with the Elves to the extent they became non KoS simply so they could stand
in the bank doorway and then pretend to go AFK denying access to anyone
else.

Pulling beta neutral merchants out of position so they get stuck and won't
work is another method of disruption frowned upon, you'd have to be about
12 years old (or be on SZ) to enjoy this I'd have thought though.  Killing
bugged merchants to force respawn on the correct spot is often quicker than
waiting on a guide to fix so if you see someone doing this don't assume
foul deeds are afoot.

Guards however are fair game no matter what, most newbies cheer guard
killers on if they are allowed to loot the odd piece of Fine Steel or
Ringmail.
