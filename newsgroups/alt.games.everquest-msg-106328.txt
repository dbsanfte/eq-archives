IMO, both.

As others have pointed out, the recharge time of a few hours on Manaburn
compares rather favorably with the one week spawn time on most Kunark level
ubermobs.  That one ability has made every Kunark level encounter a complete
joke.

And nothing about Manaburn is impossible to obtain.  All it takes is time.
It is already common enough to be used regularly by single guilds on various
servers, and that will only get worse as more and more wizards get up to it.
In a few months it will be damn near standard.

I'm not saying wizards aren't screwed over in lower levels and / or normal
experience grouping.   I'm saying the way of "fixing" them should not be to
trivialize a good quarter of the game content, including just about every epic
quest mob.  And are they really fixed if, as you imply, the only thing they
really have going for them is a "near impossible to obtain AA skill that can
only be used once every few HOURS."   Whee, they're useful once every couple
hours, the rest of the time tell them to "go port someone."

Wizards were already highly desired for raid situations before manaburn came
in.   With it, they have the option of becoming the only class that matters
for all Kunark stuff.

Dragons should not be killable by four people.
