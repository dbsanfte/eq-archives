One of the really nice points about EQ is that it has a functioning
currency. Most games at high levels, you end up getting so much money and
nowhere to spend it, so money is completely worthless (see diablo 2).
Getting rid of money would be a backward step imo. We could use some higher
denomination coins tho... or notes. Mithral coins, or 1000pp bank notes.
