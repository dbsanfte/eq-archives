My computer has been doing this for awhile now, hanging sometimes
after I select a character and try to go into the game.  The music
plays... silence.. the song starts over... eventually I get a message
I've been disconnected then bounced back to the login screen.  If I
relogin and get into the game, the lagmeter is ALWAYS at 90% and gets
to 100% in a few short moments and, of course, I'm disconnected again.

I have to reboot the PC always and keep trying.  It's not my ISP, as
I've done traceroutes.... any ideas?    I have an AMD 1.8, 64 MB video
card, 512meg memory, running Win98, etc..
