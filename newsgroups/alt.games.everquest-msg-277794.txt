Agreed. That's a good idea, but how would one qualify as meeting the 
criteria for inclusion in any sort of search results? Merely highest 
character level on the account? That in itself would be an ineffective 
filter, once secondary accounts and guild-twinked new players are 
concerned.

Possibly something to simply draw that demographic to a central 
location. The various newbie areas may be a bit too wide-spread. Perhaps 
some more centralized content on each continent?

Yup. People just starting out in EQ (yes, I'm certain they do exist) 
don't need to be rushed through content the way the typical alt will be. 
They just need people of similar level and abilities to group with and 
keep it interesting.
