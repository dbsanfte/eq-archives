    My last post on this subject was pretty pissy in tone, and I'd like to
apologize if you thought it was too much of a personal attack. After firing
it off, I thought a bit and realized there was something in what you said
that triggered a rant I've had building inside for a while: being a "gimp"
if you don't do things the way Verant intended them to be done.

    What really set that off was the recent killing of the Lord Inquisitor
Seru in melee combat. When he was first put in, VI forgot to give the boss
mob of Sanctus Seru the ability to summon folks, AND put a hole in the roof
of his "inpenetrable-except-through-the-quest" fortress. So people would
Grav Flux casters to the top of the fort and chain-nuke Seru down. Seru was
given the ability to summon, and in the interim was given "junk loot" so
nobody could profit from exploiting him. I thought the AC -99, minus 99 to
all stats "Curiass of Sad Exploitation" was a nice touch. :-)

    Then, a guild Grav Fluxed up an entire raid party and engaged Seru the
normal way. Seru cannot be harmed by melee damage - the guild had to come up
with an entire array of weaponry with damaging procs/that special bonus
damage in SoL to have tanks be able to harm him. After what was apparently a
45 minute fight, they managed to kill him. And he dropped.... the
exploitation loot. When the guild asked the GMs why he still dropped the
crud loot, they were told that since the quest to get to Seru wasn't in game
yet they had to have exploited to get to him.

    Now, this is the part that gets me. When the guild in question reported
all this to the EQ community, they were shouted down as a bunch of gimps and
exploiters who "should have known better" by the community-leading guilds.
Excuse me? The quest to kill the boss mob of one of the two major faction
groups in SoL *isn't put in the game* and you think the biggest fault lies
with the guild that killed him?!? These folks did everything else exactly
"as intended" - they fought him in his chambers, they thought up ways to
hurt him with the weaponry available to folks, they put in every effort
you'd expect of a guild trying to kill a boss - and you want to call them
gimps for trying to circumvent Verant's release of an INCOMPLETE PRODUCT?

    So that's where my rage at calling someone "lame" for killing for the
drop as opposed to completing the quest comes from. Whether someone wants to
put time into completing the quest, or put time into levelling up to kill
Brother Z, it shouldn't matter to others. EQ is not some competition where
people say "I put in 100 hours to achieve my lofty goals, if you devoted
less of your life you are an exploiter and teh suck" - or at least I hope it
isn't becoming one. (Be sure to say the quoted lines in the voice of the
Comic Store Guy from The Simpsons to get the intended effect!)
