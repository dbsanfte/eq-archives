Depends on what KIND of disconect you get...

If it's the flood-disco, where the data rate spams you off your ISP (the
right hand number on the lag-meter jumps to 3500+) then it's an error in EQs
code (I used to get the same thing when I foraged something).
Your character has performed something and your PC sends a query to the
server, the reply comes back incomplete and causes what is in effect a
Denial of Service attack on your modem... there's not a lot you can do about
these, just /bug it and hope it clears up
