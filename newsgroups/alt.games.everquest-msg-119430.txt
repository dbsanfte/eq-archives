Again, odd. My monk had mobs keep swinging after a "successful" FD
many times in the past, stood back up and started attacking until FD
recycled, the FD'd again and had it work. Only difference between the
two attempts was the mob hit me on the way down the first time.

Now, I admit it's been nearly a year and a half since I played a monk
and things may have changed since then...
