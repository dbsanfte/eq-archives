"...as long as the selection criteria isn't biased."

His selection criteria is based on the assumption that the
majority of players frequent web sites, web boards, etc.
That's not necessarily true, of course, and - IMO - definitely
not true once you further define the criteria to people who
respond to surveys.

Even the logic he uses to justify that criteria:  "sample playing
time and sample gender surveys match other surveys" isn't in
and of itself relevant, either, since they're both based on the
same assumption:  people who go to web sites (even EQ's web
site) and respond to surveys are the norm.   All that assumption
does is reinforce the bias in both surveys.

At any rate, *scientific* sampling is proven to be accurate, as
long as the selection criteria isn't in and of itself biased.  And
this survey is, IMO, fundamentally flawed since it's not a true
random sample of the player base.

GIGO, as they say.
