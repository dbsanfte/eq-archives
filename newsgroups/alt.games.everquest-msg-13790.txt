It's rather difficult to offer citations for something that doesn't
happen. Or didn't that little logical problem with your request occur
to you?

Again you invent things - I didn't claim that at all. I've stated that
it isn't happening with the sort of alarming regularity that you would
have us believe. If it was, once in awhile we'd probably hear about
it.

That was not offered as proof - that was an anecdote. The indicator
that would alert most people that it was an anecdote was the word
"Anecdote" that preceded it.

Sorry that you missed it.
