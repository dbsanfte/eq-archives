You mean to tell me that after 55 levels, 141 days played and all those
skills that high and in all the research you MUST have done you never
knew that you could only get one trade skill over 200? /boggle

Hell I stopped fishing for a while 'just in case' it was made
a real trade skill by Verant.

BTW you pay 10 a month, to play a game. How you play
the game is irrelevant.

BTW why should you have to delete this character?
