Not a great example.

The real question is WHY is it conflicting with this widget?? Two 
widgets should be able to co-exist just fine.

Either YOU failed to code properly, to account for the possibility of 
desktop widgets [e.g. like the unprofessional hackers who don't properly 
query menu bar heights, widths, fonts, colours etc from the OS and 
instad just hardcode whatever 'there' machine is set to]

Or...

The desktop widget is at fault.

If the fault is the widget. Tell your users to remove it and bitch to 
the widget maker.

If the fault is your own, suck it up, fix it, and learn from your mistake.

A better example is a some wierd failure on an obscure video or sound 
card where something not working is truly not within the reasonable 
scope of your testing, and which can't be resolved by simply saying the 
other vendor is an idiot, and remove their software.

But again: The majority of the bugs are not related to hardware/software 
on hte client machine. If that's all we ever ran up against I'd be a lot 
more sympathetic to them.
