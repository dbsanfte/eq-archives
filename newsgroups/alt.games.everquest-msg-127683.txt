My ISP decided to switch the networks they use from (what I believe was
Worldcom) to BT (/spit)
This has brought about some moments of some rather nasty packet loss but for
the most part is still playable. On top of this I have had trouble actually
connecting to the server (taking a few attempts) and when zoning (especially
porting) have been getting dumped back to server screen, normally disconnect
would have put me back to character screen. I put all these problems down to
my ISP.

Sunday I find I can't connect to Bristlebane, again. I try a couple of
others and get on fine. I go to chat to find that General Chat is now
moderated and you cannot speak in the channel....ooookay, head in the sand
time from the CS then. I go to General Chat 1 (prolly set up by players, no
CS reps there) where all the players are bitching about what ever and
indeed, there is a problem with BB...a glimmer of hope, maybe it's the
server and not my ISP. :ï¿½)
I, finally, get into Bristlebane and start doing some housekeeping, get a
Disconnect on 4th zone /sigh. Broadcast is sent that BB will be reset in
15mins (good) this won't really effect me as I'm only on for about 5 more
mins but the server seems to be in need of it.

Next day, log in, no problems getting onto Bristlebane but still my
connection is suffereing from intermittent packet loss (up in to the low
30's then clearing to the normal 0 - 3%) and I get dumped to server screen
on a test port, I swap to a pay dial up (one I use for Quake) and that
clears the Packet Loss but again, on porting I get dumped to server screen.

Not sure where to go with this now, my ISP is certainly not satisfactory but
that isn't the only problem, it would seem. Has anyone had any problems,
with ports and zoning, similar to this?
I feel that the problem my still be my end with the disconnects but not sure
where to go from here.
