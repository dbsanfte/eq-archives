Ahh the clent packages!!! Of course thats why they do things this way.
You would have to maintain one copy of each affected client package
for each server version. No fun. Thus the long time debate of keeping
dynamic files on the server vs the client. Course you could DL the
files after selecting the server instead of before. Anyway hope that
damn thing comes up soon.
