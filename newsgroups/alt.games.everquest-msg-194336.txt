can you elaborate? i thought it was unbalanced for them to add a cheal
for druids and not add any meaningful nukes for wizards pre 60th. ive
always thought it unbalanced that druids had nukes, aoe nukes AND
really good dots thrown in with heals, buffs and ports. what is it
that wizards do that druids dont? translocate? ill admit i dont see
druids doing critical hits but those are so rare as to not affect
gameplay much. if you make a comparison please dont use examples from
high end raid situations or over 60th spells because a majority of
everquest players will never see those, only the hardcore players do
so discussions should have a normal game and end game variable to it.
