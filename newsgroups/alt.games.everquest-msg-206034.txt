Doing CC with a Druid in a dungeon environment is miserable.  There
is, of course, a tremendous feeling of relief if/when you bring the
chaos under control.  But just as often I end up playing "Hey, let's
pretend this is a raid and I'm the Ranger".  I think if I ended up
having to do dungeon CC routinely with my Druid I'd just give up and
make a Paladin and twink/PL him.  Once in a while, as part of my
"Hey, I'm a Druid, I can do most anything" shtick, is fine.  But only
once in a while.
