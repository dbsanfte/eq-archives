I grasp it fine. It's incorrect. That no *players* were bothered by
the numbers doesn't mean the numbers should remain. Verant/SOE has
done this as a *business* driven decision.

who is aware of my posting history knows that I don't fall into that
neat little package.

think that "past" is the exact same as "future".
