Unfortunately, no.  This is something that I picked up from watching
shows on TV.  It was a show regarding biodiversity in the rain forest
canopy, as I recall; the one where they put an entire lab on "rafts"
in the canopy.

As to the evolution of a species, assume tree lifespan of 100 years,
and generations (remember we're talking of insects and such) of 3 per
year.  300 generations can provide differentiation such that
biologists (and nobody else) will consider them separate species.
Frankly, a 1/10 millimetre difference in spur length on a cockroach's
leg wouldn't impress me all that much.  Certainly not enough to want
my name put to it.
