Just do this get your STA to 100, otherwise nothing else is going to matter.
You will be grouped, with bufs your stats will be fine, by the 50's with
shaman bufs my rogue has all melee stats 255+ and not wearing any truely
amazing gear.
Restart if you like, but it won't really matter in the long run even if your
STA is less than 100 without gear.
