Well, at level 24, most people would be happy with the first level of focus
effects.  Level I focus items are not hard to come by, and not expensive.
By the 50's, when you need Level III for most spells you use in combat,
items are a lot harder to come by.

A 54 Mage can give my Wizard level III of mana preservation and increased
damage on my DD spells.  I don't know why more people aren't asking higher
level Mages for these things.  Level III focus items are expensive, and
often hard to get even if you have money.  Level IV is even worse.
