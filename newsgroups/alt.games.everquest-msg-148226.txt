Why yes, feelings of inferiority and impotence often lead to
a compensating hatred.

  Mark Steyn- Message from America: we're independent
  The Sunday Telegraph (U.K.) ^ | 07/07/2002 | Mark Steyn

  On Thursday, to celebrate America's Independence 
  Day, I celebrated America's independence - not just 
  from George III but from the rest of what passes for the
  civilised world. You only have to glance at the front pages
  of any European newspaper to realise that America is the
  western world's odd man out, and has been increasingly
  since September 11.

  Personally, I couldn't be happier about it. I'm delighted
  the United States is "out of step" with, say, Belgium.
  Not because I'm Belgophobic. If the Belgians want to
  support the International Criminal Court, keep Saddam
  in office until his nuke arsenal is ready to fly, and
  continue subsidising Yasser Arafat's pay-offs to the
  relicts of suicide bombers, go ahead, you're an
  independent nation.

  Unfortunately, on the European side, it's the
  very concept of independence that's at issue.
  The Rest Of The West disputes not America's
  positions so much as its right to have positions.
  To do so is "unilateralist" - which is, when you
  think about it, just another word for "independent".
  When your positions are as independent of the
  global consensus as those of Mr Bush then you must
  be - all together now - "arrogant". Or so we are
  assured by such famously modest types as John Simpson,
  the liberator of Kabul, and his anonymous interviewee
  in last week's Telegraph, the "leading British civil
  servant" who complained about the President's
  "arrogance" while describing him as "a bear of very
  little brain".

  One sympathises with Sir Hugh Sless-Auld-ffarquahar,
  GCMG or whoever it was. Obviously, the Presidency of
  the United States has never attracted the same
  calibre of talent as the Deputy Permanent Under-Secretaryship
  of the Ministry of Car Parks. But I wonder if this
  is quite the way to ensure Britain's voice is heard
  in Washington. Smug-ffarquahar's complaint is that Mr
  Bush presumes to "announce to the Palestinians who should
  and shouldn't be their leader". Actually, that's not what
  the President said and, in fact, it's the Euro-elite
  who tell people who they can vote for. In February,
  Louis Michel, the Belgian Foreign Minister, speaking
  on behalf of the EU, threatened sanctions against Italy
  if they voted for Umberto Bossi's Northern League.
  Nothing "arrogant" about that, apparently.

  In other words, the Michels and Pattens and
  Smug-Pratts are indulging in what the psychologists
  call displacement. Mr Bush is a polite, modest
  fellow. He speaks softly because he carries the
  world's biggest stick. Conversely, the Europeans
  speak ever more shrilly because their twig is even
  tinier than Osama bin Laden's notoriously small
  penis. If they wanted to, they could make the twig
  bigger, by spending more on defence. But they've
  made a conscious decision decided not to: as Paavo
  Lipponen, the Finnish Prime Minister, said in a recent
  speech in London, "the EU must not develop into a
  military superpower but must become a great power
  that will not take up arms at any occasion in order
  to defend its own interests". Perhaps it lost something
  in translation, but, if he means what he says, the
  EU has embarked on a unique scheme for world domination
  dependent on hectoring the rest of the planet into
  submission. If Mr Bush is allowed to go his own way,
  this strategy of noisy impotence - all mouth and no
  trousers - will be exposed as a sham.

  But America is also a historical anomaly: the first
  non-imperial superpower. It has no colonies and no
  desire for any. For almost 60 years, it's paid for
  the defence of the West virtually single-handed while
  creating and supporting structures - the UN, Nato,
  G8 - that exist only to allow its "allies" to pretend
  they're on an equal footing. For "allies", read
  dependencies: it's because the US provides generous
  charity defence guarantees that the European governments
  have been free to fritter away their revenues on
  socialised health care and lavish welfare. The non-arrogance
  of Washington is unparalleled in human history: it's
  American muscle that tames Bosnia but it's the ludicrous
  Paddy Ashdown who gets to swank about the joint playing
  EU viceroy.

  In Washington, meanwhile, cooler assessments are
  being made. America knows now what multilateralism
  boils down to: after September 11, Nato invoked
  its famous Article Five - an attack on one member
  is an attack on all - and, even as the declaration
  was rolling off the photocopier, a big chunk of
  America's nominal allies were insisting it didn't
  mean anything. There's no point pooling resources
  with people who have no resources to pool. There's
  no point getting together and forming a whole
  that's less than the sum of your individual part.

  If that sounds "arrogant" to Europe, well, do
  something about it. You don't want Bush to topple
  Saddam? Fine. Sign a mutual defence pact with him.
  You like Yasser that much? Send your mythical Rapid
  Reaction Force to guard Ramallah. That's what real
  powers do. But sneering civil servants being
  patronising about colonials isn't going to cut it.
  That argument was settled in 1776.
