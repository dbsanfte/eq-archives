hmmm I think I got hit by that same train last night.  Well, that's life in
BB.  I was sitting up top when I see TRAIN.  Hardly time to stand up and I
am in the middle of 12-15 pissed off gnolls.  Needless to say it did not go
well.

I guess I made out better than you though.  At least I didn't get accused of
KSing (shudder).  What a moron.  If he could have handled them all in the
first place there wouldn't have been a train.
