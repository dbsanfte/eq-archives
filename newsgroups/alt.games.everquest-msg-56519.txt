I want to wait and comment on that after the servers come up. Easy
enough to test. I can bind in the tunnel, send pet in to Orc 1. Gate to
tunnel and see if they come. I'm sure I have some friends that can
handle them if they arrive. I have outrun mobs hate lists in OT, and for
some reason I thought you could do it in WK in the old world. EC is a
damn small zone, and the distance from Orc 1 to the tunnel is going
across the short angle of it, but I'd like to test it first.
