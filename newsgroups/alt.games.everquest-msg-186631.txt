From the shadows, the mysterious "Sebet" <no@mail.for.me> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

You'd be mistaken. Considering the very first post was asking for info
on what you were doing, and you replied with a snide, bitter remark,
it's also pretty indefensible too.

Actually you became grating and bitter before I even responded. You
were giving the "woe is me!" act right from the get go.

Evidence? Have I boasted in this thread? Have I given any indication
of satisfaction? Or are you blowing out your ass because people are
starting to call you on your whining?

If you take every offer of help as someone being pompous, it's even
less of a wonder now than before why you can't get anywhere.

Woe is me....
