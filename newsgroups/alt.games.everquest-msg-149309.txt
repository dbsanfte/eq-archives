Black panther armor generally got better stats than reinforced acrylia 
armor, and are lighter, but got lower AC, and cost a LOT more. (at least 
on my server, im a 222 tailor, not even bothering to sell acrylia armor 
any more, just using my materials to do skillups now).
A lot of people want Black Panther armor for the looks, and true, it 
look good, but living monk < good looks any day.
Reason that the BP armor cost more than acylia is that the materials are 
harder to get, and have a higher material cost to make, and a LOT higher 
failure rate. At 188 you can make reinforced acrylia with 50%+ success 
rate, but at 222 (thats 232 modified) i get maybe 25% success rate on 
velius armor (which Black Panther armor is a part of).

Personally i have a 52 monk, and although i can make the black panter

armor myself i wouldnt even consider using it, prefer the high AC on

acrylia armor. 


So for your monk, get some acrylia armor and start killing. Depending on 
your servers price (my servers acrylia market dead now, people selling 
tunics for 500pp) you should get that, or if thats too costly, get some 
Wu armor, greats startup gear, and a lot of tailors will be happy to 
sell it for next to nothing instead of vendor dumping it while skilling up.
