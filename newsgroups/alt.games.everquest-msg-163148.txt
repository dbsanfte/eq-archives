Blew,

I was amusing only after it was fixed.  The error was "error loading
eqmain.dll", paraphasing it, and occurred after the patcher, but
before the license screen.  It displayed on a black screen, and I had
to Alt-Tab to get out of it.  

I discovered the work-around when I was looking up the error on the EQ
site and started up the program to reproduce the error.  Much to my
surprise I got this screen I had never seen: the license screen.  I
was then able to log onto EQ.  Later, I discovered I did not have to
have the technical support pages open, that even the EQ homepage would
suffice.

When PoP came out, I got a ba-zillion updates and accidentally started
the game without the EQ homepage open and...  IT WORKED!

Julie
