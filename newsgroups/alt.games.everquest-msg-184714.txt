   Doesn't make sense to me, individual toons in the bazaar use sweet FA
bandwidth (it's actually a relatively low activity zone in that respect) and
the cost saved in bandwidth would be utterly crushed by comparison with the
tech support costs this bug must be incurring them (seems to be really
common).

    Upgrade your video drivers, directx, and /bugreport it a lot. Not a lot
else you can do.
