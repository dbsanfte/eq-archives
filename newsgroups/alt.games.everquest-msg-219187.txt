BLs don't get any slow until level 50, when they get 30%, then 50% at 60, 
and 65% at 65.  You can avoid the cannidance issues by getting the shaman 
a mount, then you don't have to time the canning.  You still have to 
cann, but, it does make it a lot easier.  No question the BL is better 
DPS, much more so when the BL is contributing significantly though.  Once 
the BL gets to level 49, they do start to get some decent healing spells.
