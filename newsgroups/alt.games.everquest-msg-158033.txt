Trust me, I won't. It's not about the amount of exp.

It's about fairness. Whether everyone gets two blues or two ticks
will matter not to me. The pre-PoP multi-group raid situation where 
one group gets far more exp than everyone else in a collaborative
effort is flawed. Plain and simple. The model was broken. That is
not how raids should work. It creates competition between groups.
People nuke instead of heal/buff/slow/whatever to see if they
can "get the kill". I don't join raids to be part of some twisted
competition between groups.

Have I ever been in the KS group? Yes. Did that make me feel better?
Hell no, because it meant the folks in the other groups did not
get *their* just rewards, however small they may be.

Now put that in your pipe of experience and smoke it.
