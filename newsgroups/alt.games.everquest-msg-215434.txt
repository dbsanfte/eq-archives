Both procs WILL go off however there's fierce debate at the moment
whether two non-imbue procs on one weapon compete with each other for
the chance to proc.  It's also very difficult to prove either way,
simply rolling up on Test some augmented proc weapons and running some
minimal parses won't help as procs were so flaky to begin with thanks
to the RNG.

Example:

AHBS from Emp in Ssra has a lifetap proc and you can add another
lifetap proc to it (Vampire's Kiss say) from LDoN however from early
parses that I've seen whereas before you'd get for example five procs
per minute of the innate lifetap you were now getting three from
innate and two from augment or any combination of the same.  This is
bad as the LDoN augment 'taps for less and is much more likely to be
resisted.

>Could both theoretically go off on the same swing?

Difficult to say without knowing for sure how the code works.  It's
quite a complex situation now with LDoN you could have someone dual
wielding DOUBLE proccing weapons PLUS an imbue (Cry of Thunder,
Night's Dark Terror and the like.)

I'd recommend NOT putting a proc on a weapon that already has one if
you have an option to add it to a proc-free weapon instead until
things become clearer.

>Also, do focus effects combine with procs as well?

If you are talking about - for example - Improved Damage IV etc then
only if it is a spell your class would normally cast.
