Yes, that's a twink, a normal 9th level wizard would not have such
equipment. You should be ashamed of yourself and barred from the game, in
fact I am going to email Verant now and tell them to cancel your account, or
at least suspend until you have learnt you lesson.
You should have give this equipment to some more deserving players, there
are plenty in and around Nth Qeynos who are working hard to get such fine
things, giving tells to every high level character in the zone asking for
spare equipment or platinum, it is these industrious souls that deserve such
fineries ;ï¿½)

Yeah you twinked, it's not a crime and even if you gave you Wiz an SMR I'd
not give a shit and neither would most people. You have not cheated anyone,
not really even cheated yourself and you'll laugh when you think back on
this question as you are passed by a 3rd level character with 20k worth of
equipment.

Be safe and remember the power of /ignore
