Same difference I think. Using the skill, or hunting and then spending 
xp on the skill really doesn't change things.

PS AC1 is not a skill tree system. There are 30-40 skills. You select a 
bunch at the start, and you can add more over time, each one taking 
orders of magnitude longer than previous ones. So which 10 or so you 
start with and maybe the next 2 or 3 you pickup in the first 50 levels 
amount to a template.

Abilities are raised by allocating the xp you earn. xp is earned by 
killing things, doing quests, and performing actions. The xp earned 
performing an action (E.g. swinging a sword) is automatically allocated 
to that action (1 hand slash), while the rest of the xp earned can be 
spent as you see fit. Allocate enough XP to something and you get a 
skill up.

  and skill caps are level-dependent.

Technically even AC has level based skill caps as a result of the fact 
that the amount of xp expendituture required to raise a skill to X will 
inevitably require you have earned at least Y xp and that implies being 
at least level Z.

Sure. I still think the restrictions are still just an extension of stat 
gear, a big extension even, but its not entirely novel. Diablo 2 in 
particular comes to mind... my Necromancers & Soreresses had multiple 
equipment profiles, depending on whether I wanted to summon, or do 
maximum damage with Bone Spirits... I had enough +skills on items that I 
could get my skills to 35+ on either but not at the same time...

Same with my Sorcs, I had my chaff setup, which let me blast off 40 
point Frozen Orbs and Chain Lightning continuously... and I had a boss 
set up for those bosses with reflective damage, immunity to cold, etc 
that I would exterminate myself on in a heartbeat if I went guns 
blazing, so I had a massive +health, +regen, and single hit attack spell 
to wear it down in relative safety (which was crucial in 'hardcore' 
nightmare/hell)

I'd be impressed if you could devise a system where characters could 
develop along their own path, as they saw fit, without gaining the 
ability to solo effectively along the way.

Consider the EQ warrior, who is a terrible soloer, but who can, if need 
arises solo by using 50 percent of his hp, and a lot of bandages.

Imagine if same warrior could even simply strip down to silk between 
fights, cast CHeal, and get dressed ready to go... he would be vastly 
more viable as a soloer, particularly if while in silk he can also lull 
a few nearby critters, get dressed and single pull the target he's 
interested in. (Hmmm...and that's assuming he had to get undressed... EQ 
clerics can wear plate too...)

At any rate, you'd have no pure warriors... a warrior+cleric multiclass 
is simply better... 1+1 make 3.
