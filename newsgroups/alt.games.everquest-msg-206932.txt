Like Kosh said, you may have seen the fail message (" Soandso falls to
the ground"). ANd yes - mobs after level 35 may remember you when you
get back up, its dicey. This can spell disaster if you are not
careful. Ive been pulling in PoD with my SK, and sometimes it appears
the mob forgets me (ie continues to wander off) but still remembers
me. Ive had mobs suddenly run halfway across the zone to come smack me
at a later time - with friends. Quite often what Ill do is once theres
enough space between me and the mobs that I had aggro on, Ill /q while
FD'd and come back to clear the aggro just to be sure (you DONT want
to take unecessary risks in a plane lol - unless you enjoy CR's).
Splitting stationary mobs is easier since they dont wander all over
the zone (thinking evil thoughts about you and talking to thier
buddies).

For the casting FDers (necro, SK) it takes more practice because of
the casting delay. If the mob is in mid swing and the FD goes off, the
blow will still land on you and the mob wont be fooled, even if the
spell was successful. Same goes with casters - if they are in mid cast
when you FD, when the spell lands - it blows your cover.

Fortunately - you dont have to worry about that fly that landed on
your nose while you are FD with a hungry mob standing over you ;p
