Basically, yes and yes.  Also, in groups, if you have an XP penalty,
that is no longer shared with the group.

The class XP penalties were effectively eliminated by a simple trick.
Whenever you do anything that gains or loses XP, the amount gained or
lost is multiplied by your class XP penalty.  So, a Wizard still needs
10% more XP than a Cleric for a given level, but the Wizard is getting
an extra 10% XP on each kill, and losing an extra 10% on each death, so
the effect is as if there were no class XP penalty.

The other big XP change is how XP is divided in groups.  It used to be
that your share of the XP was proportional to your current XP.  Say a
level 10 and level 15 were grouped, same race and class.  Say the level
10 has 1000000 total XP and the level 15 has 3375000 total XP.  The
split would be 1000000/(1000000+3375000) for the level 10, and
3375000/(1000000+3375000) for the level 15.  That's about 23% for the
level 10 and 77% for the level 15.

Now, the split is based on level, not XP.  The split would be 10/(10+15)
and 15/(10+15).  That's 40% for the level 10 and 60% for the level 15.

The net effect of this is that you don't have to worry about group XP
any more.  If the group members are close enough in level that everyone
gets XP, then the group is fine, as far as XP goes.  You don't care
anymore whether there are hybrids in the group or whether someone has a
racial penalty.  All that matters is that they are contributing to the
group and are getting XP.  If both of those conditions are met, it is an
acceptable group.
