Idiot usually. Hypocrite if I'm in a foul mood.

Idiots come in all flavours. Their are just as many idiots carrying 
christianty badges are there are carrying badges of atheiss, muslim, 
wiccan, and any other faith, religion, or cult. 

Idiots claiming to be Christian just tend to be higher profile... Bush 
being a larger than life example.

Seriously though. Yeah there are a lot of people out there that carry a 
religious tag and have no idea what its really about. C'est la vie. That 
goes for political tags too. Its shocking how many people have no clue 
what a 'liberal' really is, or are clueless about the separation between 
government ideology and fiscal ideology... you *can* have a communist 
democracy ... or a capitalist monarchy..... but i digress.
