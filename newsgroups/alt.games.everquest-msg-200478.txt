There's still a huge bonus for fighting mobs close to your lvl, that
won't magically go away. There just aren't many old world zones where
you can get endless lvl 60+ mobs. Parts of CT maybe, can you name
another? And unless they flat out lied in that patch message, there's
not gonna be a huge difference even for a soloist. If they'd kept the
PoP ZM the same, full groups there would be getting almost double the
exp that they currently are, which is overkill imo. Even with the
changes, if their patch message is to be believed then a full group
will still get exp 1 1/2 times as fast in PoP.
