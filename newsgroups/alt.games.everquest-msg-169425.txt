The items on the list are lore but not NODROP, so you could run through the
quest with a friend without these problems and have him either get one,
come back and give it to you and get another, or else just not optimise -
visit FV/Grobb last, hit Combine, then get another one for you.

It's not entirely obvious from the description but there's also a net
profit of around 30-35 plat from the run. It was earning me about 1 blue
and 30+ plat per 25 minutes, for a cleric without SoW. Having just
entered the peridot levels cash is getting more important. :-)
