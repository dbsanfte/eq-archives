hey all

i LOVE playing a ranger ! !

and not that i want to kill the other post about agi vs sta for rangers, but
after some supa-shammy buffs, it seems agi really is more important for
rangers.......we'll check again when the ranger is higher (i was wrong when
i told him sta, oh well, shoot me)

anyway, for my own ranger, i want some TOYS ~

i have been cleaning out my old junk and i should have around 20-30k

i was thinking of a few things, but i wanted people's opinions on what toys
are most fun...this isn't the kind of search i can plug into alla's, so i
figured i'd ask ya'll, hope you don't mind.....

there's the tolan's bracer, which gives endless arrows...but doesn't work
until 45 .. i think it's like 10k on my server, something like that

there's on of those nifty 15 agi/dex bracers, but i dont think even a big
fat boost to stats is going to be as much fun as something i can literally
'play' with, hehehe

and there's a fungi, that's nice, assuming i could get one cheap
enough......i've played around with them, they're okay...i'd rather archery
kite

so what are the toys that are so much fun that you folks have enjoyed?

curious, life's savings burning a hole in my pocket,

~chrismonster~
