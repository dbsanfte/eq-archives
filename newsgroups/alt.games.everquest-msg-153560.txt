Spent about 10 hours in Crystal Caverns today and I have to say I LOVE this
zone.  In 10 hours got from 37 to 39 (and complete heal baby!!!!---aside
from current nerf, ironic I read that only an hour after getting the spell)
and made 1165pp on the gems.

Had a question about the gems though.  The chipped gems all have stats on
them.  I know on their own they have no effect on your stats but I'm
wondering about something.  If enchanted jewelry is made with them will it
make the stats on said jewelry even higher?  I noticed that the gems tended
to have the stats I'm used to seeing on the jewelry made with those gems so
wondering if there is a tie in.  I guess the flip side of that would be if
you made jewelry with the gems without enchanting the metal, would the
jewelry have stats?
