I don't know if it's still the case, but a few years back when I hosted an
MTV chat room on AOL it was made very clear to me by the kids from the start
that ANYONE can say "niggah" as long as it wasn't derogatory.  Me?  No way
in hell would I use it, but I'm not a kid...but I stopped sending account
warnings very quickly.  Now, regarding "nigger," you either have to be black
to use it or VERY good friends with the black person it's aimed at.
