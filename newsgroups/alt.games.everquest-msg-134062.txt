I can agree with this as well... I should have been more accurate and
clarified that the SOCIAL aspects are more complex then the medical
aspects.

If SS wanted to address the strictly MEDICAL aspects of HIV/AIDs, then
I wouldn't be so uptight about it.  I don't think it's possible that a
3-5 yr old can comprehend the medical aspects, but I am willing to
concede that I could be wrong about that.  My experience with that age
group is 15 years or so out of date.

However, by their own admission, SS *wants* to address the "SOCIAL"
aspects of HIV and AIDs... 

My queation HAS to be...  When do you stop? You can't just give the
child partial information and leave the rest up to his/her
imagination..

Do you explain HOW one can get HIV and AIDs? If you do, do you explain
the context of those actions..

If you do, then we are getting into sex education for toddlers.. 

And THAT is where I have the problem..

That is why I believe that this is an ill-advised idea by introducing
this subject to such a yound age...  If you can't go all the way and
explain it fully (which you can't), then why open the box??

I submit that it would be MORE damaging to go part of the way and then
leave the kid to imagine his/her own horrors, then it would be just to
wait and introduce the subject, in it's entirety later.

Of course, the "you" in this post does not apply to you, personally.  
If you are caught and/or killed with this post, the Secretary will
disavow all knowledge of posting it.

This post will self-destruct in 5 seconds.

How soo true...

You are correct. I haven't seen a Godwin crop up yet and we can't
borrow from other threads and THEIR RL threat...

And so it goes and so it goes...  :^)
