I've benn looking for an RPG and I decided on this. Bought the trilogy and
kinda got ripped off. It was supposed to have a 90 day game card which
wasn't there. The tutorial isn't there either. But what the hell. Took a
half-elf bard for no particular reason. Couldn't figure out how to get down
from the trees so I jumped (that worked like a charm). I got killed a LOT
early on, which didn't seem to be much of a drawback (other than running
across your own corpse a lot). I've made it to fourth level in a couple of
sessions, so I guess it;s time to try to play a little smarter. It's going
to take a lot of time to figure out the jargon, but that's okay. I'll never
be able to type fast enough to really communicate. But there are a couple of
things really bugging me.

- Any place i can find out what the bard songs actually do. I know one
increases my strength and dex. Another helps me locate corpses (is this
useful?). I'm not sure about the other two.

- The guildmaster sent me out to get spider silk. When I gave it to her, she
asked if I had the other things she was looking for. What other things? She
didn't mention anything else.

- Does the instrument in my inventory box represent anything or does it just
signify I'm a Bard? Gow important is it to upgrade my instrument?

- I met up with someone this morning that wanted to fight with me. We pretty
much lost each other immediately and never fought together. Do you have to
group in order to really do that? Are small groups effective at low levels?

- There were a couple of times when other players cast healing spells on me
while I was in a fight. What's the protocol for this? Sometimes they didn't
even stick around for me to say thanks. Should I just be glad someone was
willing to help a newbie out or should I have tried to pay them?

- How useful is it to learn a trade? Which trades are profitable monetarily
and personally (I'm wondering if it's cheaper to produce, say, your own
armor)?

It's a fun game and I'm sure much of this will become clearer as time goes
on. I know that's a lot of questions, but they don't seem to be the type
that seem to have been answered repeatedly here.

This is the Dude of Life
Peace out
