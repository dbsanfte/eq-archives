When I engage a mob I cast the following....

Ensnare/Snare (depending on the Druids level)
Grasping Roots/Engulfing Roots (depending on the Druids level)
DoT/DoTs
Sit Med

Do NOT nuke. Any spell that does DD has a chance of breaking Root

With root it is the luck of the draw. Some MOBs are very good at
breaking it. (Griffs of any type seem to be some of the worst for me)
More often than not though it holds at least as long as the DoT/DoTs
applied and usually long enough to refresh the DoT/DoTs. Mobs that are
animal based seem to be the easiest to land spells on. (Bears, Wolves,
Cats, Elephants, etc) In addition you can fear and charm animal based
mobs which gives you more options in combat.

You can start doing this at level 14 when you get your first DoT
Stinging Swarm. As long as you are not fighting mobs with tons of HPs.
My strategy at the lower levels is to Snare/Root/Dot/Med until the mob
is down to about 1/2 health then Melee with a Damage Shield On. This
seems to be the most time/mana efficient way of soloing as well as
keeping up basic combat skills (Offense,Defense,1HS,1HB,etc)

Cheers
