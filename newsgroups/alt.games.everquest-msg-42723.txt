You could partner up with your cleric friend and hunt ice giants outside
Permafrost for cash and experience, and keep an eye out for Martar or
Kargicebear, who will path near there, people will also shout his
location at times, and camp the cloak of the ice bear. It is dirt cheap
however, usually 100pp or so on Erollisi Marr.
