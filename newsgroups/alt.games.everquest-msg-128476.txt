I can consistantly handle 4 additional mobs without any help.  Bards
can solo, but the best bards are all very, very group/raid friendly.
I can take a group of low 50s all the way to the royals in Chardok
with no chanter/shaman, and can take 58+ melees to royals without any
other support.  Hell, I was duoing with a ranger and got to Nib and
back.  (If you know Chardok, you know exactly why that's so tough.)
I generally let my enchanters do CC, but on some raids, especially if
it's important to move quickly, I'll do CC and let the chanters worry
about slowing and aggro buffs.  For exp groups I generally prefer to
go without a chanter, the idea being that once you have a spot broken,
the additional damage output of a bard is much more useful than the
ability to mez 6 adds that don't exist.  Of course when I'm in an AE
group, I'm all about having an enchanter.  :)
