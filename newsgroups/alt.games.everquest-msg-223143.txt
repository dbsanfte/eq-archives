Been playing for almost 3 years now. Some of my input wil be based on opinion.

While i agree the pets delay doesn't change no matter which weapon you give him,
The amount of damage per weapon does. Personally. I say avoid dagger weapons on a pet at all costs.
As with the one guys comment. i've watched my pets damages over time and noticed a dagger 
seems to lower the overall damage output. More 5-10 hits than normally. (Daggers being 4 damage) Lower levels wise
I found the rusty longsword to be a ok weapon. (5 damage) Velium weapons are my general choice. (8-9 damage pending)
Currently (level 55) my pet's average hit is around 30-50 with a backstab of 161. The weapon adds more 40-50 hits for him.
ie. I hunt CC for cash. one strike the pet went it and hit


Backstab 161 (on the draw no less.)
Slash 50
Pet's Proc (whatever never figured that one out)
Slash 57
Slash 53
Proc Velium (11?)
Proc Velium
Slash 50
Pet's Proc
Kick 33

The backstab was a big suprise to me but since it was attacking from behind so be it.
So not counting the pet procs but safe to say at least 20s. the pet on the word attack 
did in excess of 450 damage befor the mob even turned around to say "arg. defilers."

At 35 (i think) the pets begin to proc. somewhere near 45-50 you get the backstab pet.
Nice to see a 161 damage. and he can do it very often also. Use your pet enhancing 
spell does more damage in general. (long run)

2. Outpost faction in OT is one of the main ones. Once you scre it up. your screwed. the fuktards in verant
made it like the faction in halas. impossible or near enough to get. hunting in KC kills outpost faction. (i found out the hard way.)
And just like being an iksar in qeynos. You have to do hundreds of turn-ins to get any real use of the fix.

    Killing brother Trillin (sp?) in WK screws up your faction with the necro guild in qeynos. likewise does
Turning in the red bandit sash to the pally guild. ( i did it for the bronze weapons then found out i goofed.)
same deal. takes hundreds of a slow turnin to fix. and one fix has a negative effect to the fation during the cycle 
of events so knowing the boneheads that made this game you get a .3% good faction hit and a -.6% negative hit for doing the quest.

   With the new POP it pretty much doesn't matter anymore since the library is neutral ground and the GMs up there are the same.

3. /pet backoff (or is it back off not sure anymore. made the key and forgot about it.) the new pet box that pops up has it automatically made.
when/if the mob turns to run use that and the pet stops attacking.

    also consider useing the life dot effect spell. (can't remember the name for the lower level one.) it should keep you near 
full health even when healing your pet with your own life.
