Yes, IF they added an AC bonus for low weight. Beastlords don't have
that now. If they simply added an ac minus for being overweight basing
it on a beastlords current AC they'd suck even more than they do now.

I also would like to see where this info came from. It would really
make sense in a way because I can't really see another reason why even
beastlord kunark equipment sucks ass so incredibly bad with such low
AC. When a semi hybrid class has lower ac than a DRUID'S equipment,
something is just wrong.
