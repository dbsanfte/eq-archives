From the looks of Best Buy's Video Card dept. it was certainly
working.  I went in there on the 5th or 6th and it looked like a bomb
went off.  Between and endcap and roughly 10' of shelving 3 layers
high they had about 20 cards, 1 of which was a VisionTek Extasy 64m
GF2, the rest were either ATI Radeon 7000 32m AGP or the Radeon 8500.

I asked the gal about it and she said it was crazy, none of the stores
can seem to keep them in stock mainly cuz the distribution center is
having problems getting them fast enough.  She said that RAM and Video
cards are going like water =)
