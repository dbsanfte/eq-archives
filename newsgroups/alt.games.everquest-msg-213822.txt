Agreed about the blind part. But not so much with the rest. Rather than 
avoid human races give them hints on dealing with blindness.

1) keep your newbie candle/torch until you have better. And use it when 
you can't see. Many (all??) light sources work if they are in an 
unbagged inventory slot. A good newbie lightsource is firebeetle eyes. 
Kill a firebeetle, and keep its eye, you can do this around 2nd level.

2) Get a lightstone as soon as possible. Kill a wisp, they can be found 
near most human settlements, you need a magic weapon to hit. (or if your 
a caster ... you are all set).

Hmmm. I think Warriors and Rogues don't solo well at all at low levels. 
Shaman & Bards do very very well on their own.

But in any case don't let that be your deciding factor, pick what you 
think you want to play. Even if it is 'efficient' you won't enjoy it if 
you don't want to be a Frog Wizard (although they are quite workable).

Then again maybe not. Grouping early will help you learn many of those 
issues without the bucket load of deaths.

BUT stay away from Power-Leveling twinks; you will level so fast and so 
effortlessly that when it comes time to actually pull your weight you 
won't know how to play, you won't know what your skills do, you won't 
have a clue what you can actually fight and survive, you won't know any 
tactics, and odds are few if any of your skills will be maxed. This is a 
bad thing.

Also, while getting healed or buffed by hi-level chars is nice, don't 
come to rely on it, otherwise its the same boat as above. When your 
damage shield out damages the monsters, and your regneration outheals 
their damage you aren't learning anything... and eventually you won't be 
able to play; and you'll just frustrate your peers as they find they 
have to teach you very basic things you simply should already know.

It is a newbie freindly class. But "I wouldn't play one if I didn't want 
one."
