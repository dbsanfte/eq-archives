Hmm I think I need to get a magelo link for you then.

I have a guildie cleric whos a HP nut like you (e.g he said today, "am i the
only cleric that when they get summoned, actually stands and takes a few
blows, and hits the mob back?")

Hes at (or extremely close to) 6khp, and you guys have killed mobs we
haven't, so I wonder whats different :)
Btw did you mean Focus of Soul?

What makes me laugh,  that cleric is actually in competition with a ranger
in the guild for the most HP! :)
