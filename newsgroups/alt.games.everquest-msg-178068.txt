Anyone heard anything on whether they will add another bazaar zone 
(hopefully with less lag) or up the limit?  I think CT has hit 750 
traders before so it seems likely that with a limit of 500 you'd have a 
lot of people that couldn't sell.  Perhaps one bazaar zone for newbie 
stuff, another for armor and weapons, and another for everything else.

While we're at it, can we have a PoK with less lag?
