The enchanter is a much higher priority.  If the MT dies, but the chanter
lives, then you either replace the MT with  the SA, or you go to
root/rot, or you keep everything mezed, rez the MT, buff him up, and
start again.

If the chanter dies, mezes start fading, and shortly thereafter everyone
dies, cleric first (cause he's way up on the list of everything for healing
the MT)

The chanter needs buffed more than the MT, because adding a thousand
HP to someone with 900HP to start with makes a lot more difference
than adding 1000HP to someone who started with 4000. For optimal
efficiency, you want the MT buffed up too, of course, its silly to be
CHealing for 1000hp less than you could have (and for him to take
damage 5% faster than he would have with AC buffs, if he's below cap)
but if I had to choose for some reason (only one peridot left, perhaps?)
I'd buff the chanter.

Cel heal is for people who don't have aggro, Remedy is for those who
do... or you should check out the new Ethereal Remedy.  Divine Light
is now in my "never mem this, back of the book" section.

AC isn't AC unless its up in the "Sweet spot" range for the mob you are
facing.  HP is always HP, but AC doesn't care if you are at 200 or 300 AC
if the AC range for the mob is at the 800 to 1000 area.  I rarely put AC
on any pure caster, shaman, or druid, they almost never have enough
base AC for what I can add to make any difference at all.  Oddly, I probably
shouldn't bother putting it on most paladins, SK, or warriors, either, since
much of the time they are up Past the cap where more AC would make any
difference.  Rangers, Rogues, Monks, Clerics, Bards and maybe Beastlords
(frankly I've never grouped with a post 50 beastlord) are the classes who
tend to benefit most from AC buffs, but they really shouldn't be tanking for any

sustained length of time... well maybe the monks.

A good chanter will haste the cleric and the pets!
