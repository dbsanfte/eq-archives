Ah, but the difference is obvious!  You CAN turn off other buffs at
any time, just as you can turn off tribute buffs.  And in both cases
there is a cost to turning the buffs back on.  For spell buffs, it's
the need to have the caster present and with the mana to spare, and
there's time involved for both the casting and (usually) switching
spell gems.  But for tribute buffs, you have to go back to a unique
NPC, who's often in an awkward location.  (I'll wager many characters
rarely if ever go back to their starting cities, especially if you
don't count those lucky classes who get faithstones/spiritstones to
let them use those cities as additional gate destinations.)

If you're willing to settle for all or most of your buffs coming from
people in your group, you can all pause to buff up just before going
into an LDoN or whatever and get full "value" for the resources used.
But even if you're paying for a KEI in PoK before setting out, and so
in some sense you're "wasting" some plat when the KEI runs while you're
FOM, that's a lot better than having to go to your home city to get a
buff and then having to pay for it while you travel to PoK to get more
buffs and THEN go wherever you're really headed.

Hm, I wonder if clerics/shaman make more use of tribute, just because
they DO have the easy transport home.
