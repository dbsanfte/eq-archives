I am running an Athlon 1600+/Geforce3/56k modem. This line seemed to help
lag in some zones for me - most notably Rivervale. My zone times never
seemed to be a problem with either setting.

The most notable thing for me was the dramatic loss of visual quality with
UseUmbra=FALSE in heavily shadowed areas. Shadows were no longer transparent
at all, just an inky black clip plane a short distance from the player. I am
back on UseUmbra=TRUE.
