This may be a bit of a stretch, but i saw the dual monitor wall papers that
you can download, so does that mean the game will support dual monitors? I
did a google search but didn't come accross anything.

Is there anyone playing that has dual monitors? I'm going to try this
tonight, so i'll post my results.
