As in not a single line of code ever existed. 

However, it did have a framework, concepts, race ideas, feature ideas 
etc etc... as much as any mmorpg would be during a requirements 
gathering / specification stage. 

More importantly it had a bigger more devoted community of potential 
players than some real games... that makes it more real than many of the 
vapourware over the years... and in some sense makes it more real than 
some of the games that were actually (partly?) coded but died without 
publication. :)

Which is why i like the karmic (feedback) system I postulated in another 
thread. Let people do what they want, and let everyone know what these 
people do, and let justice take care of itself.

Trouble is games have historically rewarded assholes. Its tough to get 
busted for killstealing in EQ... you have to really be a moron for it to 
happen. Leapfrogging isn't even an offense. On rallos zek the players 
were much easier to kill than the mobs, and tended to drop --far-- more 
cash, and they spent much of their time sitting down at low health, low 
mana... ripe for the griefer...

No game has ever had any reasonable consequences for being an ass. Sure 
you can lament that freedom being limited is lame. But -anything- is 
better than what we have now: Asshats run rampant because they can -and- 
there is nothing anyone can do about it.

I'd rather more of #2 too, but I'll take #1 over the existing setup.
