There's also a tinkered item (Anizok's Gauze Press) that has 20 charges of
summon bandage, and is rechargeable with a class one mana battery.  Each
charge summons a stack of 20 bandages.  The cost is about half that of
store-bought bandages.

You can summon 8000 bandages with one stack of batteries.  

The advantage over the skinning knife is that you can summon the bandages at
will.
