Exactly.  Your medidate skill will never improve (there is a way, but it's 
useless), and is only there to make it faster to mem songs.
A recent patch completely change bard song mem times, so I'm not even sure 
if you need meditate at all now.  (I can now mem all 8 songs in the time 
it previously took to mem any single level 60 song.)
