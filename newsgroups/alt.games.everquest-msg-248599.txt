Its a good suggestion... still has a couple holes in it...

If the group doesn't 'de-group' until every mob has reset then 
inadvertantly pulling a mob-from-home not knowing he's part of a 50 mob 
train of which some mob hasn't gotten home yet... is possible... and 
lethal == worse than trains as is.

If the mobs do de-group the moment they get home then its still possible 
to pull a train, lose it, and then single pull the first guy home -- 
back through the rest of the returning train without risk == exploit.

Personally...if those are the options I'd rather just keep the trains as 
is. I hear the death penalty is much less in EQ2 and all the important 
stuff will be instanced... so really who really cares if you get munched 
by the odd train???

fwiw I'm not *trying to nitpick*... I'm genuinely interested in devising 
an actual algorithm thats reasonable to implement that isn't 
exploitable/stupid.
