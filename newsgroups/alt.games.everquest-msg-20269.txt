LOL! He,bizbee, and their ilk (read Lokari) confuse the sudden silence after
their rampages, with dishing out some slapdown to some 'one hit wonder',
when really it's the sound of their spewage silently wafting off into a
killfile, never to be seen or considered by more reasonable minds.

Heh.  Poetic actually.  I can imagine bizbee is foaming at the jowls after
the stuff I said about 'him/her' earlier, but alas I'll never have to see
it.  Such fun!

Oh yeah, what were your account details again?
