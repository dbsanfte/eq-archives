But thats backwards!  Handing in the GLS the same way yields far more
exp, and a book that sells for 8 to 9pp, which is in the neighborhood
of what the GLS tend to sell for... if its more, then its really backwards,
while if its less, you have to think what the exp is worth to you... to me
its worth a few PP loss.  Doing the LS quest, on the other hand, yields
a book thats worth what, half a pp?  Selling to LS to a vendor would
yield more if I recall correctly, but you can probably get 1pp to 2pp
selling it to people trying to get fast quest exp for their low levels.

Obligatory note: you need a magic weapon to melee wisps.
