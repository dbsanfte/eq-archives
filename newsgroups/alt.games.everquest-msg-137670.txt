No you can't, silly.

You are saying that because I can't cast
fireballs, I therefore own the items in game?

I could use the same argument and ask, are you
able to drive your car through Freeport?

Of course, it has no bearing on the argument, but
what can I say... you started it.

So you say. That does not make it so.

I either have ownership or I do not. They belong
to me, or they belong to someone else.

This is what they say;
"We and our suppliers shall retain ownership of
all intellectual property rights relating to or
residing in the Software, documentation and the
Games. The Software is a "commercial item."

They may give you some sort of control, but you
own nothing. Try and understand that. You don't
seem to have a problem with it when people are
trying to sell their accounts.

What you are claiming is ownership is not, in
fact, ownership, it is a pale imitation.

No, he doesn't. Verant owns them, that's why I
cannot sell them for cash.

I have control of them, but I do not own them.

You can stick the fireballs up your ass, while
your grovelling.
