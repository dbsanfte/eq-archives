Yes, bring a chanter.

I also suggest that you consider having a cleric DA pull (you can't
levitate in PoAir, but the island you pull from will drop you a few
hundred feet down to the previous island).  The island where these
things spawn is KOS.  if you bring up your group or groups, there is a
good chance of getting more on you as you are fighting.
