OK, this helps somewhat.  What I'm hearing on this thread now is faction
is not directly related to hate.  Is that true?  So that orc pawn is
ready to attack but doesn't because his hate is low?  I mean, I can
stand toe-to-toe and he doesn't attack.  If I sit, on the otherhand,
that must be a big hate booster so he does attack? 

I always rationalized that green skeletons would attack simply because
either a) they're stupid or b) they had no fear of death (since they
were undead). 

Lets start a list on what determines if you're aggro'd:

You have : 
1) Faction 
2) Hate 
3) Religion
4) Race

What other variables does SOE use?  Class? Level?
