        I started playing a warrior about 2 years ago. To me it seems 
that back then a warrior was a good class  to play,  but now, well  who 
  needs a warrior. A druid can go to BW and pull 3 giants  and  kill 
them with no help. A ranger can take care of a few  no problem. 
Necromancers also   have  no  problems. any clas with a pet  can rule 
the day.  seems that Eq has become a casters game. Now i have a few 
caster clases, but it ssems that in the early days  everyone needed 
everyone to have a good time.
