Sure, Im a level 55 druid who doesnt know what spells to mem. So far for FM
ive been using the following spells (while farming the rare cycle)

1)Form of the howler. (sow and mana regen)
2)Skin like nature (hp+ac+regen)
3)Resist magic (I hate root)
4)Breath of ro (damage mob)
5)Winged death (damage mob some more)
6)Sow (You do want druids to sow you for donations/free right?), or maybe
your not soloing and have a partner.
7)Ring of butcher (banking, selling)
8)Gate/circle of combine (to get back from bank)
9)Ensnare (Absolutely always memmed spell)
10)Engulfing roots (We need this for our dots)
11)Levitate. Darn named mobs always seem to spawn on the top of mountains.
12)Scoraie. Ineficient way of killing things, but necessary for some caster
mobs.

I guess I must be a real newbie, cos I cant work out how to get by with 8.
Or maybe im just inept. sigh. This game is just so hard to work out things
like that. Plzz tell me what 8 spells I should be using.

I wont even start on my necro.... or wondering about shamans in parties.
