I started playing EQ a few months back and am finding myself becomming
more discouraged.  On E'Ci I leveled a Necro to 40, a Druid to 35, and
a Bard to 28.  During this whole time, I've never been in a dungeon.
All guilds at this level do nothing.  There are no dungeon groups and
and it's getting boring soloing or sitting in one place with a bunch
of high level players' uber twinked alts leveling.  Almost every
pre-PoP zone is nearly deserted except the obvious ones.  I know that
when I get to PoP level I'll never get invited to raids since I don't
have any dungeon experience.  What's a newbie to do these days?
