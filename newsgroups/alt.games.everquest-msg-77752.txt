I went the Fungus teleporter route to Katta a couple days ago for the first
time.  Towards the far end of the Fungus zone is a mound that stretches a
finger of stone to the tunnel that has the portal.  You have to look up to
see it...I passed right under it a couple times before I found it.

Everything in Fungus was deep red to my lvl39 mage but nothing saw thru
invis.  The only other players were lvl60's if that gives you a clue <g>.  I
just prayed it would hold up because you have to brush past some to get to
the tunnel.  I don't know if they would aggro or not...I wasn't about to
find out.

Once you reach the portal, you have to click on it to activate it.

You end up at the top of a tower in Twilight.  There is an NPC who stands
right next to the portal but I didn't con her.  Everyone else I saw in the
tower (including guards) con'd dubious to me except the mage spell vendor
(indiff).  I don't know why.  My mage is gnome-brell.

I didn't have a map so I just wandered along the shoreline it I found Katta.
I actually found the entrance to the Scarlet Desert first.

Katta is beautiful and HUGE (and unfortunately empty).  This zone would be
the perfect place to act as the hub of a world as it could never get crowded
here.  But since no races start here and it is not real easy to get to, I'm
afraid it will remain empty.  I found both indiff and dubious con NPCs here.
