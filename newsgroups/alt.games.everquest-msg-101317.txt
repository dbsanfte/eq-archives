So?  I *do* go through that "hassle" when I need to inspect someone.
It takes about 3 seconds to type /inspect on, or /inspect off.

Yup.  For some odd reason, I like to know which people are polite and
which are not.

Why don't they just use /who to see what class I am?  The answer "you
might have /anon on" is worthless; they won't know unless they do it,
will they?  And I *know* they don't bother using /who because I'm
never anonymous.  (It's a roleplaying thing; I consider any Paladin
who's anonymous to be an idiot.)

No.  It makes no sense *to you* to think of it as rude.  You have to
remember, I'm one of those weird sorts who hold the doors for ladies,
who assist the elderly in slippery parking lots, open holes in traffic
for semis and other such oddities.

Just out of curiosity, how does my having inspection notification
turned on cause grief for others?
