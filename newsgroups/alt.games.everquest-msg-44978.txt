You guys have always given me such good advice in the past so I was
thinking... I am finally starting to make some pp, not a huge amount, but
now that I'm grouping a lot in CB I have about 80 pp in the bank (I realize
to most of you that amount is nothing but it's the most I've ever had). I
want to buy some decent armor, right now have a mix of mostly armor that was
given to me and a few pretty good pieces that I've saved for. I have tizmark
leggings (given to me) and a tortoise shell helm (paid 25 pp for all I had
at the time) but most of what I have is rawhide or leather. Can you give me
some suggestions or is what I have good enough (Have banded cloak and chain
tunic too, also given to me) Thanks!
