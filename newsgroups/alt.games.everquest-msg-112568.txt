  Yeah, that's the argument that I made almost word for word when I was new
to the server.  Everything you say is true, but that aside, 99% of the time
there's little justification for these characters which are, according to EQ
lore, supposed to be enemies by virtue of their religious beliefs or the
inherant nature of their being.

  And despite the alignment grouping restrictions, characters of opposing
limits CAN still fight together against a common foe, it's just that they
can't share exp for kills and they can't cast beneficial magic on one
another (without the use of exploits).  In literature, you may read about
two enemies banding together to fight a common foe, but usually is an
extrodinary circumstance... they don't just come together to improve their
combat skills, or for moderate material gain, which are the two reasons the
majority of groups form in EQ.  In the extraordinary circumstance that a
dark elf and a high elven cleric might have some reason to join forces, they
can still do so, they just can't split experience, which, if the scenario is
being roleplayed for the sake of roleplay, is unimportant.

  That's why I say the alignment grouping restrictions keep people honest
with their roleplay.  I don't think that necromancers of Bertoxxulous and
clerics of Rodcet Nife should be grouping as a matter of routine, and I'm
glad there's a game mechanic in place to prevent that sort of thing from
happening (or at least to make people think twice before they do it).  I do
think that the alignments should be a bit better defined... based more on
deity and less on race.  I think agnostics of any race should be able to
group with anybody, but I think that worshippers of Tunare should perhaps
not be allowed to group with followers of Innoruuk.
