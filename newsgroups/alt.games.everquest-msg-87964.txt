Just go to www.nvidia.com

Get the newest drivers for your OS, win 9x, xp ME, whatever.
They are 23.11.

All it says on EQ casters realm is:

"This problem has been seen with the 21.83 video drivers."

HAS BEEN SEEN WITH, so get the newer ones and you should be fine.
The 23.11 work great on my tnt 16 meg agp card.
