First off, go to eqtraders.com, and check out the "learn a skill" area. You
can find some "walkthroughs" that will show you how to get your skill to
master status in a short amount of time, and for little $$$. Even with these
"shortcuts", you will still have to level up quite a bit, in order to afford
the items you need for tradeskills. Frankly, the only tradeskill that MIGHT
make you plat, is jewelrycraft. Of course, it is also the most expensive to
learn. Tailoring will enable you to make some newbie armour though.

Good luck.
