Now, that, I can certainly agree with...  I love playing my druid...  But
for some reason, I cannot -stand- most other druids...  There is the
occasional one (very few of them halflings.. LOL) that I get along with...
But when I go to Cobalt Scar for the hopes of hunting a wyvern or two,
mainly to whittle the time away, and -hope- for an arctic wyvern hide..
Heh...  the pain of working up tailoring... LOL..

    But I zone in, only to find 3 Druids and/or Wizards (usually druids,
though), monopolizing all 12 spawns...  /sigh...  head to sky shrine and
(forage / auction for my spells that are supposed to drop off certain mobs,
but never seem to do so...).  LOL.. :)
