No, I think you're wrong there.  Most of these crossposters are posting
something they, in their great wisdom, think everyone needs to read (be it
an ad, religious drivel, political toadying, whatever), and so they pick a
number of newsgroups and cross-post it.  I don't know if you've noticed but
usually when someone cross-posts they never, ever reply to the post.  In
other words, they post, leave their drivel for us to read, and go find
something else they can cross-post.  So no, I don't think replying to their
posts is encouraging them.  On the other hand it can be quite amusing :)

Take End Times Prophet for example.  He posts telling us that we'sa all
goin'ta HEY-el!  Well, he knows that any of the people he's talking to
aren't going to agree that they're going to hell (or at least going to be
judged when Jesus comes back, whenever he plans to get around to it -- hey,
man, really, I thought General MacArthur was bad about that kind of thing
but I think 2000 years has got to be hitting some kind of record!).  Not
only so but people like that (at least the ones I've met) are so eminently
secure in their beliefs that they consider it unnecessary to engage in
arguments about them -- they're right so obviously everyone else is wrong,
arguments are just plain pointless, doncha know.

Spammers don't read the replies to their ads for obvious reasons -- they're
not posting to actually discuss anything, just to tell us they have
something we want and to hope someone will actually be dumb enough to
believe them and give them their money.

Etc., etc.  So, no, I don't think replying to those messages encourages them
(as I said before).  On the other hand, I do more or less understand the
complaint that replying to them shoves them in the face of people who
already deleted the thread because they don't want to read it.  I don't have
that problem because I can block an entire thread if I want to, so I never
see the replies.  But taking that into account, I may be more judicious
about responding to people like that -- of course, there will always be
times when I just *can't* resist blasting an idiot :)
