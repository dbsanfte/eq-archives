Hard to say whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. For a large 
number of players knowing that they aren't looking at 30 days /played to 
get anywhere is a good thing. Not everyone has 1000s of hours to throw 
at a single video game... in WoW the people that do finish quickly, but 
at least the people who don't can also see a good chunk of the game.

Pretty arrogant for you to decide how other people have fun.

Interacting can take more than one form, making little "adventure 
groups" is not the only way to "interact" in an online game, especially 
one that is trying to be an 'open ended virtual world'.

Ok... on that we agree. :)
