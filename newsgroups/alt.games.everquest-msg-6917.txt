I was wondering why you went to the Warrior from the monk and now that they are
about the same level, how you compare them.  I played an Iksar monk to 14 and
liked him, but I hate the way they look so I started a new human one yesterday
and have him at level 5.  Never really tried a Warrior though and wondered how
they compare to someopne who has exp with both.. thanks!
