The halloween events of last year were an elegant solution to the problem of
not having enough GMs to do special events on all the servers.

Instead of special events as you may be used to, what they did was
essentially the same as when they revamped Cazik Thule or Split Paw; used
the same maps but changed the content.  They did this as a patch, across all
servers at the same time.  Then they left the altered zones up for a week,
and took them back to original content with the next patch.

Most of the loot that dropped was tagged "no drop" which means that if you
missed it, you missed it, those items never dropped anywhere else.  Until
very recently I still wore a pixie rib earring that dropped there, as much
for the sentiment as for not being able to replace it with something
better.  I also have a belt and neck piece that I still keep for resist
gear... or realistically just to remind me of what fun that week was.

As with my comments on how silly it is for people to concentrate on same old
same old raid targets when PoP has just been released, this was never before
seen content that was downright fun to explore; bring in your level
appropriate alts and do this or that with them, bring in your main and go
after the big guns... heck, we set up a carnival ride using a mob in EK that
had a phenomenal knockback, keeping him rooted and having people go in,
aggro him, and get shot off into space trying to make it to the river from
the hill over the farm.

Fun.

Look into it.
