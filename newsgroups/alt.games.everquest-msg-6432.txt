Based one the story you've told, the bard was definitely in the wrong.
Kiting isn't a problem per se, but repeatedly pulling what he's kiting
through populated areas and over other groups is a big problem. You

watch a scene while invisible, and no doubt would have smacked him
down hard for what you describe.
