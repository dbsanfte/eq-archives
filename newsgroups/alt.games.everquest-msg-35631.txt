Greater Wolf Form tops out at about 5% higher speed than regular wolf
form. Not much, but every little bit...

Fury of Air, just like Dizzying Wind, etc, is an "all or nothing"
spell. It either hits for full damage or is *completely* resisted. Up
to you whether you want to play the crapshoot or not.

As for Careless Lightning vs Combust... Look at mana efficience.
Careless tops out at 1.32 damage per mana. Combust tops out at 1.65
damage per mana. Choosing Careless over Combust is like choosing a
3/15 weapon over a 7/25 because the 3/15 swings faster. 3/15's good
for practice, but I'll take the 7/25 in a real fight any day given a
choice between the two.
