 I don't think they ever came all the way up...I'm a little frustrated, I
just HAVE to be having account problems for the first time ever...my credit
card expires at the end of the month, just got the new one on Saturday, go
to update my billing..and whammo...can't access anything. Wait until it's
9am PST this morning to start trying to figure out what I need to
do....everything is all screwy 'cause of the PoP release and I'm hoping my
character and all my items are okay...arrggg.
 Sorry, venting.
