Not having it announced meant not having 400 people camped
right outside the zone (it was well-known where the zone would
be located) waiting for the servers to come back up, of course.
Combine that with the guilds scrambling to get mobs that
spawn right after the servers come back up and Stonebrunt
got a little "breathing room."
