No, totally wrong, chests drop in solo encounters.  Soloing 
Orange/Yellow/White mobs in Thundering Steppes at level 20, I was getting 
about 2% xp for 3 or so mobs killed, in addition, I was getting another 
5% or so boost each time I completed the quest I got to kill those 
specific mob types, usually around 12 of them.  So, that was about 13% xp 
for killing 12 mobs.  In that time I did get 3 chests.  In all my soloing 
I have gotten numerous chests with anything from junk items to just sell 
to spells and tradeskill books.

In EQ1, when I was level 20, back before the days of the super xp zones, 
that would be about the same rate of progress.  Today, with paludal 
Caverns for that level, EQ1 is far faster using dark blue mobs to level.

I still manage to solo green double up arrow group encounters that 
consist of a single mob.

And, oddly enough, solo encounter will give you chests too.  At something 
on the order of 1/6th or so of the drop rate of group encounter, where, 
you have to share the chests with up to 5 other people...

Already mentioned above, but I'll reiterate, chests do drop from solo 
encounters.  On Saturday afternoon, soloing about 40 bears and wolves, I 
got 4 chests to drop for me.  On Sunday, soloing snakes, antelopes, and 
beetles in Thundering Steppes, I got 2 chests to drop for me. Between the 
bears and wolves, and the TS mobs, and the associated quests I was doing 
that required me to kill them, I got 90% of level 20 done, and dinged 21, 
as I already had made some progress into the level prior to that.

That is true, but they do drop plenty of sellable loot, much of which 
stacks.
