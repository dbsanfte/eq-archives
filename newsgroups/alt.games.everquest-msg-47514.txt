This is actually a "known bug" in which resurrections are possible.
However, should this happen again, in order to get a "CS Resurrection" you
must do a /report <your_character_name>  in essence reporting the last 10
lines concerning you, yourself.  I have a macro made to report myself, since
at times I may be caught off guard when things such as this happens.
Remember, anything concering you (/tells, /auction, /damage taken, etc) is
sent into text on the servers whenever you do a /report  on yourself.  So
you should be quick and do this before you are actually dead.  Just in case.

So, turn on damage taken messages on if not already (I doubt they aren't)
and if it happens again, be sure to press that macro which reports yourself.
Then once you are done zoning (or going back to bind point) do a /petition,
then hope the queue isnt too entirely long.. else you may have a wait ahead
of you. :(
