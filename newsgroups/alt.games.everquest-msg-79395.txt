Swearing in game is reportable/actionable.  Killing an NPC
simply isn't.

If you're evil, and want to make some cash, those little masked
rodents at the wall in Misty drop a 10pp spear and 1pp shield
everytime, and they are only 25 and 30.  Pretty good reason to
kill them.

You should wean yourself from running to guards at some point
anyway - in many zones they don't exist, and at higher levels
they can't handle your mess anyway.
