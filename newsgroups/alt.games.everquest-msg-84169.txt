I certainly agree that there are different feels to each of the 
expansions, but I kind of like that.  I don't really have a problem with 
the CoH restrictions, because I know how CoH is used to get around 
content, and I don't really like it.  This week we had a guild raid to 
Akheva.  We fought in to a nice spot in the middle, then GM wanted to do 
the mobs in the extreme NE corner of the zone.  A mage took a death, necro 
dragged his corpse to where we wanted to be fighting, feign-flopping past 
the see-invis mobs, and then rezzed the mage who CoH'd the rest of the 
raid.  We did fight our way out, but only the last 18 or so who stayed 
late.  I expect we will do the same wherever we can.  I don't always like 
it, and I would prefer to fight in and out, but it certainly makes it 
faster to do guild raids.
Maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems that the tactics have 
evolved well beyond what Verant intended.  How can you enable CoH and not 
have it be abused?  I would love to have it so you could add latecomers to 
a raid, but it is used to bypass content.
