Hard missions at level 65 feature much harder mobs than anywhere short
of the Elemental planes and in much tighter spots than most Elemental
xp groups fight in.  The one and only hard 65 pickup group I did on
hard had six deaths inside the first ten minutes before giving up.
From memory and my perspective it went a little like this.  Group was
Ranger, Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, LD person I don't remember and
Wizard.

Zone in buffed, one person has gone LD during zone in and never comes
back.  Warrior tags nearest mob, gets three 900 hitters.  Shaman
attempts to slow with Tigirs, I snare one and park it halfway up a
wall.  Entrap sticks first cast, root sticks first cast.  Good.

I turn around just in time to see the Shaman root park another one
opposite me so I Entrap it to make ghetto CC a bit easier.  Shaman
heals himself, I heal myself.  Shaman has slowed the Warriors current
target but it mitigates so damage is horrible, Cleric screws up the
third CH and/or mob gets lucky with the RNG and Warrior goes splat.

Deaths: 1

We all go maximum DPS as the mob was nearly dead and it flops over.
Much hurried discussion along the lines of "WTF they were hitting for
900?!" ensues and it's quickly decided to rot/nuke/archery the other
two rather than rez the Warrior right away.

Takes us about 2-3 minutes to kite/move/root the other two along the
wall so I can hit them with archery but out of melee range us but it's
all going *fairly* well until the Wizard gets stunned trying to get
away after a big nuke, gets in melee range of both mobs and pretty
much gets one rounded.

Deaths: 2

One mob dies and we rez the Warrior (if only to make him feel better
having done nothing for the last while other than sit nekkid in PoK.)
The Shaman and I eventually kill the other mob while the Cleric meds.

Mob dies, Cleric rezzes the Wizard and rebuffs them both.

Next pull is a single and by this time we're treating them with 1000%
more respect.  The mob comes solo and again is slowed partially, the
Warrior piles in and the Cleric begins the CH at 50%... which is too
late and only Shaman patch heals keep him up but this draws aggro to
the Shaman who stands his ground, casts Quiescence on himself and
begins to cast root so he can back off but dies before he's finished
casting!

The mob shifts immediately to the Cleric (presumably it didn't care
for that last CH on the Warrior) and gets him down to one bub so he
hits DA.  I tell the Warrior to back the hell off so I can root park
the mob but he's not listening, hasn't noticed the Cleric's DA message
and flops over in very short order.  I root the mob just as the Wizard
wakes up and nukes like a fiend breaking root and drawing the mob to
himself like a fly to a cowpat.  Instead of running this time he tries
to root and... uh... gets one-rounded again for his trouble.

Deaths: 4

Shaman is not happy.  Warrior is not happy.  Against my better
judgement I'm persuaded to carry on.  The Warrior insists we do not
root mobs he's trying to get aggro on.  I locate my gate potion and
move it to a main inventory slot just in case.

Next pull is again a single but slow is resisted twice before taking
causing the mob to stick to the Shaman like glue, the Cleric and I
both massively overheal the Shaman to keep him standing while the
Warrior tries to get aggro back.  For once the Wizard can nuke
unmolested and he does.  Somehow we win and nobody dies so the Warrior
gets all gung-ho and sticks his head around a corner aggroing two mobs
before we're ready.  The Shaman slows, I root park the add and this
time the Warrior hits some disc rather than dying straight off the bat
so we do ok for a little while however once we get to the second mob
it becomes clear the the Cleric has been going almost OOM every fight
without saying anything and he announces 'enough for one more CH' out
of the blue.  So he sits down to med.  Naturally this causes the mob
to run straight over and kill him before he can even stand back up.
Meanwhile the Shaman is doing his best to keep the Warrior upright but
eventually the good old RNG gets the better of him and the mob gets a
streak of max hits in and the Warrior dies again.  Between us we kill
the last remaining mob somehow and decide to call it a day.

Deaths: 6

Admittedly this was Day One of LDoN and no one knew that the mobs hit
for 900, mitigated slow and all the other good stuff but the confined
space and super high DPS mobs were an utterly lethal combination. 

(The fact that we had no proper CC and only five people didn't help
much I grant you.)
