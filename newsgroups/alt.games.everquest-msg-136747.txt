I wasn't thinking that he was lying until you
mentioned it, but there's something odd about the
story. 

I was thinking that whoever put it there wasn't
intending to pick it up with another character. It
was fairly expensive gear, so its not likely that
a newbie dropped it. 

I wouldn't hide a $50 note at the entrance to a
shopping mall.
