I'm considering the following item:

Chetari Wardstaff
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
Damage: 22
Delay: 40
Ratio: 1.818 Amazing
AC: +5 Str: +2 Sta: +3 Agi: +2 Dex: +6 Wis: +1 Int: +14 Cha: +8 Magic
Resist: +7 Fire Resist: +3 Cold Resist: +12 Poison Resist: +11 Disease
Resist: +8 HP: +15 Mana: +10
Weight: 8.5
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Blunt
Effect:  Knockback

I like this staff because of the ac, the int obviously, the cha and the
various resists.

It does however take up two slots that are currently occupied by:

Book of Obulus
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
Wis: +8 Int: +8 Magic Resist: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Mana: +45
Weight: 5.0
Inventory Slot: Secondary Melee
Effect: Improved Healing II
Type: Permanent
Charges: Unlimited
Level for Effect: 1

I like this item for the int, the resist and the mana, and also for the
effect. I thought it would make me heal better with bandages, or make me
regenerate faster. As it turns out, it might only make my renew elements
more effective, and that is debatable.

In my other hand is:
History of the Di'zok
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
AC: +15 Wis: +2 Int: +2 Cha: +2 HP: +35 Mana: +35
Weight: 3.0
Inventory Slot: Either Melee

I like this item for the ac, the hp and the mana.

So, what do you recommend, stick with the books or swap to the staff?? I'm
most concerned about a good 70hp and a bunch of mana I'd miss out on,
combined with the loss of improved healing (although it might well be
useless to a mage).
I'm considering this switch because I should really be carrying a staff. I
am a mighty mage afterall, not a librarian. I like that I can contribute to
a fight myself, even if it's an abismally small amount, the effect should
help the group efford though, I hope.

Any advice? I might be completely off the mark here, so if you have any
better combinations, feel free to contribute. Money is no object, provided
it's not over 10k :)
