Lol, so untrue its funny.  This from the guy who "forgot more about EQ than
I'll ever know"?

I remember a PoF raid, 3 60 mages went to the side, to make themselves a
little exp (2 epic pets) I was pulling to the raid and some pathed through
them, so I went and started hittin on mobs, makin sure the mages didn't die.

3 mobs, I got exp on 2.

You have such a hardon about primal, really, I don't know why.   Primal
isn't even in the game anymore (ok ok so it got replaced with a pretty much
identical item, its not oldschool primal!), it drops like candy now, and
infact the first real challenge (North Tov) is guarded by a mob, for which
primal is USELESS.

You are unlikely to encounter anything as difficult as Aary by choice in
ntov (2 dragons come to mind) and every other mob is a joke in comparison...
primal equals jack shit in passing the real entry test of NToV.  You will
see yourself, when you step up from WToV/EToV sometime...

I dunno about you, but I've tanked everything post-nerf that I could
pre-nerf.  Nothing really exotic, but since the "nerf" I've happily tanked
CT, THO, Arch-Lich guards etc.
