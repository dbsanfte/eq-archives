My monk and SK have audio triggers for both the "<myname> has fallen
to the ground" and "You are no longer feigning death" messages.  I find
the audio a lot easier to notice than spotting the chat message.

I recently bought the first level of Stonewall AA, and added a trigger
that reassures me when I manage to maintain a feign through a spell.

I do sometimes wonder how SK FD computes the failure chance.  On a monk,
it's presumably linked to the FD skill level.  Does the spell just have
a fixed failure rate, or is it more complex than that?  Anyone know?
