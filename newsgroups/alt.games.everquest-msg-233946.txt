I play a bard and do a lot of pulling in ldon.  Lately people have begun
shrinking me as soon as we enter the dungeon without even asking if I want
it.  First off, I don't want to be shrunk.  It interferes with my targetting
and line of sight during the pull.  Second, why would anyone want to be
shrunk?  I could see 1 shrink if youre a large race would be helpful so you
dont get stuck in the few doors where there is a problem.  But maximum
shrink?  Why?  Is this a ranger thing?
