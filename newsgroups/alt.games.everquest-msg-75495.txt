It depends on how far you de-level. I think the current cap is 2
levels above your current when de-leveling. In other words if a level
13 with maxed skills de-leveled to 10 he would have level 12 skills.

This change was made because some people on Player Vs Player servers
would level up to 30+ then de-level to 10 for example. They would then
proceed to slaughter lower level characters with there much higher
skill levels.
