"u" and "r" will never be accepted English.
The message to cell phone limitation is the only real one and will
change rather than accepting "u" and "r". As cell phones and things
improve you will no longer have 130 character limits for messages.

Any paper those kids are doing that on should get an "F." Then 
the teacher should write, "I can do 3r33t "shorthand" too, "F" Is
short for FAIL!"
