	No, I can't. I can't fault Verant much, except for when they special
case rules.

	What I can fault them for is for taking actions against players
when it's their code that's broken and the players aren't ruining anyone's
fun. How would Conquest, if they actually managed to kill Ventani (which
they weren't even close to), have ruined the game for everyone else?

	That's the biggest point I want Verant to get. Do not punish players
because they thought of stuff you didn't. Instead fix the stuff they did. Only
punish people if they're causing grief.

	It's what Turbine does in Asheron's Call, and it makes a lot of sense.

	I can argue with it because Verant has a history of saying,
"it's supposed to be this way," and being wrong. A long history. Cloth
caps on warders seems inherently wrong, and their pap answers of "this
is intentional" strike that old chord of, "we have no idea what we're
talking about."

	They knew shortly after we took down Hraashna. Afterlife has
a Verant employee in their guild, and they heard how we did it from one
of our guildmates.

	When Narris found out that Conquest used these tactics to take
out Hraashna and get that far on Ventani, he expressed surprise, because
he thought they were fixed. This happend shortly after the whole incident
in FOH's IRC channel.

	It's not inside information, I just happened to be privvy to it
as it happened.

	It's occured to us, and we have from time to time. But we get
different answers from different guides and GMs, and depending on what
time we're doing stuff, it really doesn't make a lot of sense to petition
before we do anything, because it would severly limit how quickly we
can do things.

	GMs just aren't available that much. When they are, their answers
are contradictory.
