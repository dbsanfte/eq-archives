Either the lizard race or humans.  That is your choice.  I still wonder why
the new "Cat Race" cannot become monks.  Oh well.

Lizards are hard to play if you are not familar with how the world is set
up.  You will be KOS in most locations and without prior experience of
exploring the world with another character this may prove to be frustrating.

If you choose Human you have two cities you can start from.  One is Freeport
and one is Qeynos.  The major difference in these two is that if you start a
human monk from Freeport you cannot choose to be agnostic.  If you start
from Qeynos you can choose agnostic.  Choosing agnostic may help you be less
KOS in some circumstances than if you choose one of the available religions
monks can follow.  (If I am wrong about this then someone correct me.  I
tried making my Human monk agnostic and starting him from Freeport but the
game would not let me.  When I choose agnostic it always started me in
Qeynos eventhough I had selected Freeport.)

Best race with natural abilities that complement Monk is Lizard race.  Best
monk to play where KOS will not be an issue is Human Agnostic Monk from
Qeynos.  Put all the points you can into STA.  I made a human monk awhile
back and put it all into agility.  This was a mistake when I found out that
there are more than enough pieces of monk armor out there to add to you
agility.
