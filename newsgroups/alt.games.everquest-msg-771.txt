Spell book has every spell up to and including all 49 spells,
with the single exception of the 39 drop only SOV spell
Turning of the unnatural.  The 44 SOV drop only spell
-is- in the book, and has virtually replaced all other heals
in practical use, although CHeal is also a potent tool

This includes the spell Ressurection; 90% exp loss recovery
spell that puts this character in demand in a wide variety of
raids.


Character has a 185 blackmithing skill, has repeatedly
made FS plate and HIE Cultural smithing weapons

Character is in good faction with all good cities with
the exception of Bards... and work another day in
MM should erase that unfortunate episode.

Character is at Warmly in Thurgadin and Kindly to
Claws of Veeshan, including Wuoshi; has the tooth
for Great Divide and Wakening Lands.
==================================
I did not do an equipment list for the bard, but its
a minor twink, wearing full BI visibles for the look,
only exceptional piece of equipment is a MM Battledrum
for the increase to Selo's running speed.  All song
skills capped at level, 1hs capped at level, good
defense and offense skills; not a PL hollow shell, but
a nice functional secondary character I played
up for a couple weeks when I stalled out in the mid
30's on the cleric.  All songs up to level in book, and
several levels more in the bank awaiting leveling.
