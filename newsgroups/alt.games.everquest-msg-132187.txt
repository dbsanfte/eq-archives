Velious, IIRC.

As a trading post between Qeynos and Freeport, and to keep an eye on the
Tier'dal.

Ok, spill.

Hmm, Al'kabor seems to think they were there before even the Combine Empire.
At least, I seem to recall that.  Hey, that's an idea, why don't we see if
we can thread together the official EQ history (taking into account ret-cons
and things no longer available).

I know they were both slaves of the Shissar, but I don't think they were
created by them.  Granted, it gets a bit fuzzy before the green.

Well, the Acrylia mines were formerly held by the Vah Shirr, but the Grimms
have taken over it.  I imagine Shar Val is disputed land.

Well, the Drachs are part Tier'dal, so it sort of makes sense.  Although
there is a possible connection through Ring of Scale (since it's a bit odd
that hunting in Mistmoore raises a faction on Kunark).

Hmm, haven't found official reference to her yet.

Alas, the story really isn't as prominent as it should be.  I'm sort of
hoping PoP fixes that.

Poor quest scripting.  There should be more historical knowledge for uber
quests.  Even if someone did hit a spoiler site, they would certainly glean
something.
