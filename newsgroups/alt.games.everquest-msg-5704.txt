Maybe charisma doesn't affect enchanter's spells as much as it does a bards
songs (after all songs are manafree), but I can guarantee from personal
experience playing a bard that every point of charisma makes a difference in
resists AND from what I've noticed, duration of charms/mez/fear.
YES, charisma affects the fear song...  I can get resisted everytime with my
base charisma of 100, and with my charisma gear on to get it to 180 I might
get resisted once while fear kiting (which takes a long time since bards dmg
is horrendous doing melee - but hey it works)

Dex doesn't affect fizzle rate, true, but it does affect how fast your
instrument skills raise (along with intelligence) so high dex will make them
fizzle less due to faster skill increase.

STR is solely for how much you want to be able to carry.  In a full suit of
plate armor you can be restricted, but honestly the charisma or dex are more
important than strength.  Bards using their faction song and illusion masks
(once you get them) can bank in almost any city.  I'm level 35 and can
currently bank everywhere except Cabilis just using the dark elf illusion
mask and the faction song.  And once I hand in some bonechips I'll be able
to bank in Cabilis without using the invisibility song.  So, by being able
to bank, buy/sell in every city, and being able to run there faster than sow
using that handy drum of yours, weight is no longer an issue because you can
get rid of it sooner than other classes.

Don't worry about stamina either...we're not tanks, and aren't made to take
damage anyway.  Even if you solo, the extra 25 hitpoints you might have from
the extra STA by level 30 won't help much.

Good luck!
