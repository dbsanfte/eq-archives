For 1hs the answer is definitely yes...many excelllent ranger 1hs weapons
are about and the epics are 1hs.

Nope - at least I have never seen any skill ups on a green except in those
weird bits at very low level where you ca pull xp of the mob.

The unenchanted ones, yes its looknig pretty, at low level its often
because they right clicked while looting a body. That would drop it into
the ear slot rather than the inventory bags, If the item is enchanted then
it will have useful stats.

You do the sharpening at a forge. This is smithing trade skill and the
best place for any answers is to browse www.eqtraders.com for the recipes
for anything (in this case one rusty weapon and one stone in a forge and
combine). It will give list of supplies and where to find them

They disappear, and pretty quickly to...Im not 100% sure but I think its a
matter of minutes.
