A bard with Hymn can do this up to mid teens. Find a very low non-bashing blue, turn on
Hymn, equip a fast but low damage weapon, and work the blue near the zone
edge somewhere. A blue that flees when near dead is good, since it will heal
a little then return for a couple of more whacks. Just be aware that occasionally
when the mob returns it will attack to your rear. It's not unattended, but you can
leave the keyboard for minutes at a time. This is arguably an exploit but it is
not risk free so it's arguably not an exploit.

You could get the same effect with regen (or regen equipment) perhaps. The key is that once
the mob flees, by the time it returns you're healed and it's not.

Also, if you can arrange that an NPC mob heals your blue, you can make the blue last much
longer, indefinitely with care.

Int equipment might help with skill-ups.
