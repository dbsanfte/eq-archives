Well, in the case of most spells, both should add agro.  Landing one 
CHeal demonstrates that you have the ability to do that, and should cause 
the mob to get quite irate if he sees you casting again.  Same would 
apply to DD spells and DoTs.  Not so much for a single time cast spell 
like slow.  I mean, once you have slowed the mob, it's not like he has to 
worry about you doing it again, unless he has a way to remove the slow, 
or unless he is going to live longer than 6.5 minutes (for Turgur's 
anyway).
