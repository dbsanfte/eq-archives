Ports are typically blocked for a 'reason'. Sometimes its not a 'good 
reason', but unless its a very small ISP getting anything like this 
'fixed' by them is a royal pain in the ass due to the bureacracy, and 
the almost impentrable walls they hide the system administrators behind.

The customer support team is there to assist users who've screwed up 
their own computers mostly, and occasionally relay that they're aware of 
an issue at their end, they literally run through printed 
troubleshooting scripts, and they frequently have a limited ability to 
understand and relay what you are asking them to do... couple that with 
a policy to not let joe-customr talk with the engineering/administration 
team and their is simply rarely any clear way to get the message to the 
system administrators, someone who can make the policy decision to 
unblock the port.

Plus with a larger ISP its a big task for them too...isp-grade Cisco 
routers are harder to setup than typical soho/home linksys/dlink/smc 
ones...they aren't likely to initiate an ISP wide configuration change 
simply because some user wants to play a video game...

Its probably easier by far to get a different ISP. :)
