It appears to me the community on the Safehouse doesn't seem to answer
all the questions I think it should able playing a rogue. I field two
or three questions a day about playing rogues, what to practice, and
what poisons are worthwhile.

It also sems rather monolithic, there are different ways the play the
class, and some there don't seem to "cotton" to other ways of doing
things.

Do you think that the user base can support a second Rogue web
presence?
