Possibly... but then OoW will likely end up at the same price point at 
those stores.

But we aren't arguing the specific price point per se, but rather my 
comments were: -- despite the theory that expansions are getting 
'smaller and more frequent' we are still being charged the same amount 
for each. DT contradicted that, arguing that in fact the price had 
dropped lately... from specifically 30 to 20 for the recent expansions.

Your observation, which may well be true, still doesn't validate his 
assertion that the price has in fact *dropped*...even if one sets aside 
the specific numbers and just looks at the trends.
