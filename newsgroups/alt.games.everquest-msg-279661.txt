That's precisely the point. We can "un-fuck it up" where our own little 
corner of Norrath is concerned. Personally, I feel that if we can get 
enough people together who aren't so concerned with power-levelling and 
getting all the cool gear asap, we can eliminate the majority of what 
detracts from the game.

Come on, James. Give it a shot. The worst that can happen is you just 
decide it's not for you. As I mentioned, this would be conducted, at 
least initially, as a guild for alts and new players, so infrequent 
playtime wouldn't be a problem. If the new players decide they want to 
level faster, that will be ok. If they decide they want to level faster 
and buy better gear, that will be ok too. We will wish them luck and 
send them off to find a guild more suited to their preferences.

Email me if interested (remove the "spamsux" from the address, of 
course).

Oh, and for the record, I also plan to give Vanguard a serious look when 
it is released, but that's still going to be a while yet.
