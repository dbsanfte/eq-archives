Recent group in LoIO, Left Patio:

Main Tank:  Shadow Knight
Healer:  Druid
Mezzer/slower:  My cute little bard
add in a rogue and a wizard, and a ranger for pulling.

The ranger liked to pull when the mob was down to two bubbles.  Usually,
this worked out, but every once in a while, it didn't.  Mr. Ranger found two
angery lizzies at enterence, and both decided to follow him home.  Well,
that meant that he got back a bit before we intended, and our current mob
was still haning around.  Or druid was on the lowish side for mana, and we
weren't at our peak (we had been stringing the fights as much as possible,
several of us were close to dinging, and I really wanted to start using
Consonant Chain, since that meant the druid could med more, and I could
"snare").  Well, I quickly jump into cha gear and pick up my lute and mez
the first one.  Well, our main tank is still finishing off the mob in front
of him, and out paper tank is heading south quickly.

That's where Mr. Wizard comes in (anyone remember him?  Bah Bill Nye has
nothing on Mr. Wizard's World).  He stands up, and shouts "I am the Black
Mage, I cast the spells that make people fall down!"  Actually, he didn't
but it would have been cool.  Still, the ability to end the SK's fight NOW
turned a potentially difficult situation into a "ok, it's time to take a med
break, that was a bit too close."
