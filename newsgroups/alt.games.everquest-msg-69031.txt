Just out of curiousity, why #5?  I have played the same 2 races, and,
to be quite honest, prefered the barbarian version (partially comfort
level - my 5th barb toon - know Everfrost like the back of my hand)
and a big strike against the Vah Shir was not the race itself, but the
players in EQ itself... first time I logged that char in, there were
201 players in zone, 1/3rd of which were level 55 or better... can you
say extreme twink action?  I knew you could... zone lag was so bad you
couldn't move regardless of class.

If anything, the quests were probably easier to do as a barbarian (a
plus or minus, depending on how you look at it) then they were for the
Vah Shir... again, it may just be that Everfrost comfort zone that
made it easier....
