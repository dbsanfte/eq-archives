Thanks  man.  I've was in a bad mood when I arrived at work today but 
reading this really brightened my day.  These alleged facts of yours are 
not something you might like to keep around I understand, as well as my 
response.  The fact that I had to search for the context of your post 
speaks volumes.  Of course what you included in your response also says 
a lot about you.  In conclusion let me  just say that I will post as 
pleases  me,  not  you.
