Rofl, hey! This is Liveye by the way. :p Was surprized to see someone
I knew post here. The 50 buck crack was just a guess though, I've had
computer repair stores try to sell me these old junky ass 14 inch
monitors that were from like the 1980's that were blurry as crap for
like $20-30 dollars, one even had a green tint. Come to think of it
mine may be 15'', I've never really measured since it came with my HP
system, but it never screws up on any resolution I set it to which is
nice. Hope it doesn't crap out on me, I seem to have bad luck when
searching for a regular monitor for a low price...
