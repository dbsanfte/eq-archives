    ...and impossible to do anything about it.

    You can't question the choice of when to award DKPs, because there's
always a justification. "We want to increase participation in some of the
less rewarding events. Tell you beforehand? Why? You should show up to EVERY
event, no?" You can't question the tiny adding errors, because they can
either be written off as accidents or can't be proven. The points page of
one of the guilds involved doesn't go back to point zero, and they overwrite
the totals every time they update. So how do you prove an error? And if you
just come out and say "the officers and GL are cheating", how many people
will just shut up and ignore it so they can stay a part of the gravy train,
leaving you strung out to dry?

    The OP was talking about officer reward, which is a far cry from
"random". If you take the time and examine the rewards in an OR system, you
can usually pick up on the patterns quickly. You might not like what you
see, but there is usually a method to it.
