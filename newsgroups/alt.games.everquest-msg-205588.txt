Hello, my name is Dan, and I'm...uh...I'm a 2-boxer.
(Hello Dan!)

I have yet to meet a 2-boxer who can play 2 important classes well in
anything but easy situations with one exception:  MT & main healer...and
that's ONLY if that group has a second healer to keep everyone ELSE alive.

Yes, I two-box.  I sometimes 3-box but here's what I do:

Two-boxing:  enchanter & mage.  Enchanter and wizard.  Druid & mage.   In
each of these cases there's at least one character that doesn't take a brain
surgeon to play adequately (notice I didn't say "expertly"...just "good
enough").  I do it to fill a group and to add DPS.

Three-boxing:  ambulance service after a wipe.   Or PLing.  Or transporting.

Dual-boxing is no longer stressful to me but I don't enjoy doing it a lot.
Tri-boxing is ALWAYS stressful to me unless I'm simply PLing, and even then
it's not a lot of fun.
