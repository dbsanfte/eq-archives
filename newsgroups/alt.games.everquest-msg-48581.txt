I am using Blueyonders Surf unlimited, pretty good service so far.   At the
start they were terrible, but of late there has been Zero lag, and a
connection every time... for the last six months actually!  (touches some
wood real quick!)
They have no nasty two hour cut off and redial etc either, unlike some of
the other ISP's...
