I don't know why this question has come up again. It's a commonly known
fact that part of "The Vision" (TM) is that EQ is a group oriented game.
Everything in the game is designed with grouping in mind. It's been, in
my experience, equally common knowledge which I was told from my
earliest newbie days, that around level 16 the conning begins to change.
By then, you should be grouping. A mob that cons even to you at 20
indicates that a *full group* of 20th level characters should have no
trouble taking it down. And they don't if played well. If it's blue,
that full group should take it down with ease, and they do.

Same at the high end. Last thing our group was fighting was seafury
cyclops. They con blue to a 51 warrior. We only had three people in our
group and were handling them with ease. I have no doubt that they would
be trivial to a full group of six of us.

The conning system is working as intended.
