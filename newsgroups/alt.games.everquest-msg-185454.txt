After weeks in Dulak and 3 days straight killing Vurag, I finally got the
Tooth instead of his lame belt.  Since then many on my server (Bertox) have
been argueing over the haste on this item.  I really have no idea, although
it is noticably faster then SCHW.  I saw one sell about a week ago for 90k
(!) and last night for 70k, and there is one in bazaar for 75k now.  I was
just hoping someone could tell me what haste is on the thing so i have
something to tell potential buyers and what a good price is for it.  Any
help would be great, I wanna sell it fast while it is still new and rare.
Thanks,
Blant
