Good for you.  You are not stopping your grandkids from doing drugs, 
scamming people, or swearing.  You are also not really stopping them 
from being exposed to those things.  But you are sending a message 
that you don't approve of those things.  Also by insisting on 
supervising, you are there to explain things to the kids and re-
enforce your beliefs.  This is how kids learn.  

Other people may not see anything wrong with swearing, scamming, etc 
etc.  The point really is, if you see something that you think is 
wrong and you don't TELL your kids you think its wrong, you are 
telling them you think its right.

Whether you personal values are "right" or "wrong" the fact that you 
care enough to try and teach them is wonderful.  So many folks just 
don't give a BLEEP anymore. :-(

Av, if you feel comfortable letting your child play EQ, there is 
nothing wrong with that.  You know your kid (I hope) and you know the 
game.  Therefore you know if there are things in the game that your 
kid isn't ready for, or if he's at a point where he can hold his own.  
Every kid is different.  Every adult has a different idea of what they 
want to teach their kids.  At least you play the game and know what 
your child is doing, which is more than most parents. <shrug>
