I go to the bookstore because a friend tells me "A Ripping Yarn" by Raphe
Plumden is good.  When I get there, I see a huge display for his 
just-released sequel "Another Ripping Yarn".

"Hmm," I think to myself, "His second book is newer, therefore I'll never 
need to know the background in the first book in order to follow the 
action without being confused..."

Personally, even with computer games,I tend to ask myself which th first 
in the series was, and get that one first.  Even if Zork II or Doom II 
would have made just as much sense without the first ones.  I doubt I'm 
the only one that does this.  If you're lucky, I will have asked a friend 
or read a review, and that may infulence my purchase in one direction or 
the other.
