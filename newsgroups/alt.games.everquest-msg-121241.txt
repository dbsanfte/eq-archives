I was in FM a while back.  I can't remember but I think it was a
goblin bonecharmer that crossed my path while I was kiting some
giants.  I had SOW and once it saw me I was sure it was casting while
running because it never stopped.  I knew that add with the giants was
more than I could handle so I made a dash for the OT Zone.  It kept up
with me casting all the time.  That was the only time I had that
happen but it sure seemd to be casting on the run.
