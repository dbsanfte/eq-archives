As long as you don't make  public what you wan't to
do you should be ok. Oops scratch that too late :).

Anyway as long as both bills are paid and EVERYTHING you
do in game is by the book meaning you aren't the types
to draw the attention of GM's by bitching or being bitched
about you'll be ok. Just one tip though. Don't bother
getting in touch with customer service if the person you
share your account with empties your bank box or lets your
main char rot at the bottom of the hole ect.
