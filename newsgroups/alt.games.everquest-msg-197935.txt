I was just looking at the changes made to gravity flux on Lucy:

http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=73&source=Live

It looks like they nerfed it to, perhaps, keep people from using it as
an exploit to get over a wall or obstacle.

It went from pushback 1, push up 10, to pushback 2, push up 1.

Anyone tried it since the patch?
