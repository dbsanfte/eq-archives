I've not seen a single kobold that raises the faction of the kitties,
they are all just erud and paineel.

My dark elf is glower dubious and gets dissed so has no way to 
get higher. Maybe using the cheap one use halfing quest form thing
would help but that is pretty goofy, plus I think its probably more
due to innoruuk being her god. My wood elf druid was indiff by default
and has killed virtually everything that has walked or crawled so I
don't know why the kitties diss my dark elf and say she has slayed
spirits or something.
