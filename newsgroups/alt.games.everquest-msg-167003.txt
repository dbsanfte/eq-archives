You surprise me. I didn't think anyone would still
be hanging around after all this.

I disagree.

Everything I wanted to say about the subject was
in the exchange with David Navarro. 

He seemed to recognise it for the pompous rant it
was, (as did Kaev), and gave it what it deserved.

(DN: Well... I'd venture that ninety percent of
the people who stick their nose up at emoticons
aren't good enough writers not to need them. :-P

TB: You are right, I accept the criticism.)

The exchanges with BS, are not an attempt at
serious argument, I've tried that before with him,
its fruitless.

Thats because you are a dense piece of shit barely
capable of understanding the written word :-P ;-)
8-)..etc,etc..

Ok.. I'm with you. We'll call it Year One

Yes, I did. 

No matter how many times you tell him that, he
still asks.

You ain't seen nothing yet.

Both?

I wouldn't want to paint it, though.
