Well, I heard that there were some people who actually liked Voyager,
and I did not want to risk condeming Ben to a pleasant experience.
"Voyage to the Bottom of the Ratings" was so bad that even the Flying
Mini-Subs couldn't save it.  It was so bad that "Battlestar Galactica"
and "Space: 1999" appear almost redeemable in contrast to it.  Not to
say that "ST: Voyager" wasn't pretty awful, it used to come on late at
night when I'd be sitting around BSing with some friends, and we'd mute
the sound to shouts of "Let the lamination begin!" ("extremely lame"
having been transformed to "laminated" in our addled brains).  Really,
the only show I've seen as bad as "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"
would be "Cleopatra: 2525", and if Ben is a heterosexual male under the
age of 95 he'd probably have no trouble at all ignoring the sound and
enjoying the visuals (at 95+ it's easier, just lose the hearing aid),
so it had to be eliminated immediately as a candidate.
