Hmm, as I understood it, each haste item has a specific haste percentage.  
The haste effect is level affected, but, the level of the haste effect is 
set on the item, it is not based on the level of the player.  RBG for 
instance is fixed at a haste of 27% (set to a level of 26 for the effect, 
and haste is equal to level+1).  Your Soulscream Belt is fixed at 31% 
haste (level 30 effect).
