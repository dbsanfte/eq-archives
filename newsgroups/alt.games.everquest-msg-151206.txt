I've started on the Coldain Prayer shawls quests.  Only to be started if 
you have money enough to
sink into tradeskills.
Figured out I can sole the Giants in GD if I root and DoT (much easier 
with KEI tho).  Up to needing the eggs for that dang souffle for last 
step of the 3rd shawl.  Hubby's ranger is on same part :-(  Oh well, 
I'll get it done eventually.

Check eqdruids.com, there may be a quest or 2 you can do that's listed 
there.
Good luck
