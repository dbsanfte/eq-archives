Go to any FPS gaming NG and they'll tell you the best ISDN card to use for
the cash is the Asuscom internal TA. There is an external TA that
outperforms this (can't remember the name of the manufacturer off hand, not
a well known one to me) but that costs close to ukï¿½200.
Modem means Modulate-Demodulate. A Modem has to convert a digital signal to
analogue to send data and vice versa to receive it. The actual bandwidth on
a 56k modem (good connection is around 52k) isn't much less than a single
ISDN channel (64k) it's just the work it needs to do that slows it down.

In theory that should be faster than ISDN (althou not by much) the extra D/L
speed will help and upload is the same as a single ISDN channel (That's a
bit stingy tho' Even in the UK our ADSL is 512/256 or 512/128 at worst) When
we were on our 256k leased line at work I could get pings of only about the
same as my pings at home, in the 50 range. This would be maintained when 2
of us were playing on the network, so the extra bandwidth there did not make
that much difference.

Many of the Quake crowd in the UK now look upon ISDN in the same light as
they used to look upon modems. With their Cable and ADSL they can get pings
in the high 20's and low 30's compared to the 50 ish of a good ISDN
connection. Personally I prefer the dial up options of ISDN, if one ISP
sucks I can use another. My ISDN line itself has never failed unlike NTL,
Telewest and BTO.
In EQ terms..pings of around 200 and less but ping isn't so important (if
it's green it's good) providing the Packet loss stays below 10% (it's
normally 0 for me...normally) the game is more than playable.
