What belt is that?  I looked up Thistlecoat and it didn't list an item
with that effect, so maybe it was a higher level DS spell, which would
get more interesting. :-)

And most items I've found with actual DS have it as a modifier, which
I found meant they work only if you have some other DS for them to add
to.  I got some DoN-merchant augments that have that, for instance.

You could have the bard add the DS and such during the fight but drop
out of the group just before each kill.  Depends on how much effort you're
willing to put into PLing.

Yes, you get a ring that casts a DS (does not stack with the potions),
five charges and rechargeable free at entrance to Chardok as long as you
have ally faction.

My monk had to kill a rare spawn in Chardok for my 1.0, which is why I
have some experience with the spottiness of FD to avoid faction hits.
But I still managed to be "warmly" or thereabouts by the time I finished
with that camp, and a couple visits to the goblin mines was enough to
boost me back up.

Forcing people to do occasional raids is fine as long as there are
ways to regain faction if you want to.  I gather POG is bad that way,
no way to undo the damage?  Haven't hunted there myself; as you say,
people would rather not, now that the gear and quests are outdated.
PoSky is apparently even worse, if you accidentally get "implicated"
in a kill on the lunatic there, you're forever KoS to the quest NPCs
and such, which makes certain epics impossible.
