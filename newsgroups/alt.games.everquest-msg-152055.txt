<Snip of uninformed and juvenile post....>

No ones forcing you to pay for a service you dont want Ace. Based on your
post Im assuming that the whole concept of "Free Enterprise" is lost on you.

Verant provides a service, namely access to the EQ game server. People pay
for that service if they feel it is worth their while.

Seems pretty simple to me.
