This may win an award for the funniest thing ever posted here. This
group rode through an "invasion" of the FA fanboys led by Duh-Venger
with nary more than a ripple above the normal signal to noise ratio.  I
doubt the most clueless posters here (except the first time ones coming
here to complain that their TRS-80 won't run Luclin) would think that an
ex-employee of VI could significantly do anything for them, since he
can't walk into his office and figure out why you lost your rusty mace
on the trade following the South Ro orc camp raid last night. You should
be relatively safe.
