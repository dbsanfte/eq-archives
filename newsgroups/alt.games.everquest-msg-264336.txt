It's a way for the game company to pass on the costs of beta to
someone else - at 4GB a pop per person, that's a lot of bandwidth.

This way they get 4500 beta testers for free, and since it's
subscribers only, they're a lot more like to actually want to play and
test, as opposed to people who'll sign up for any beta as long as it's
free.

And it'll never go purely FP only, as it'll alienate their targeted
user base - why PAY to test a game when you're doing the company a
favour ?  Maybe if they offered a free month to all FP subscribers,
but that'll never happen.

And it beats WoW's bittorrent method of delivery.
