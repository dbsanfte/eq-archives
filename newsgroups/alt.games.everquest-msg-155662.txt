Necro pet + charm-casting mobs = bad.  Gorge of King Xorbb taught me
that one tonight.  Owie.

One question I've got though - I cast screaming terror on an evil eye
once tonight and of course it's pet was still quite happy to keep
slapping me around - tried to sick my pet on the pet and it kept
telling me it couldn't wake an evil eye.  I made darn sure I had the
pet targeted and not the eye, too.  Would that be a bug or "working as
intended"?

(has been running into quite a few charm-casting mobs lately, dangit)
