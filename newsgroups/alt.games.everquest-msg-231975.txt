Contrary to my experience, but maybe I've just been lucky.

The one race that always makes me wary is Frogloks. I can trace this 
feeling back to the first Froglok I ever met, an overtwinked 
overprivileged idiotic richkid shaman ... grrrr. Most other Frogloks 
that I've met are okay if not great (hi, Insanebob), so maybe this 
racial hatred will pass in time.

Going back to the original poster's question: anyone announcing a 
casino gets an instant /ignore from me -- which doesn't really help, as 
they're usually alts and mules anyway, but at least I don't have to 
listen to them anymore. Those who invite me into their group without 
asking me first gets a stern lecture and then, if they don't clue in, 
an ignore. Those who beg for buffs in ooc, shouts, or tells gets 
*immediately* ignored (save for SoW or KEI). Same for those who beg for 
armour and/or weapons.

Pity that when you /ignore someone, you don't stop seeing them. It 
would be very satisfying to have someone simply blink out of existence 
(to you, to the universe at large; take your pick) as soon as you hit 
the enter key on that particular command. And if you group with someone 
on your ignore list, you can still see them in group chat -- I'm not 
sure if that's a bug or a feature, though.

What's interesting is that some offensive spells can be cast on other 
players, and some can not. Every spell can be cast on yourself, 
detrimental or not, at least in my experience. And any spell you can 
cast on yourself, you can (usually) cast on group members, if not 
random passerby. Wouldn't it be *horrible* if these "runners" found 
themselves adhered to the ground? I ask purely for the academic 
enlightenment of it all, as I would _never_ do such a thing. I can't. 
I'm a beastlord. Snares aren't in my spellbook.
