Of course, but the question was not about the people who _are_
able to appreciate their own life, no matter how troubled it might
be at the moment, or are not psychotic and have a modicum of 
ability to think rationally. The question was whether or not to feel 
compassion towards the mentally ill not in possession of all their 
faculties who do successfully terminate their own lives.

I would like to hear justification for not feeling compassion towards
those people.
