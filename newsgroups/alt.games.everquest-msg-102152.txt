Since you may not speak Goblin, you may have misinterpreted the
Goblin's apparently rude behavior toward you.

What he was irate about was that you stole his spawn.  He got his spawn
back, and proceded to chew you out after having dispensed it.

Perhaps next time you'll be a little more circumspect before attacking
a mob.

Misunderstandings are common with those we have bad faction and little
understanding.
