Can't answer about the video problems.  From everything I have seen, your
are SOL with the SB Live card.  You can turn off all acceleration using
dxdiag, which is far from an ideal solution, but seems to take care of most
people's sound problems, at the expense of the 3d sound.  I am using Win2k
with a cheesy SB compatible sound card, and the sound sucks, there are some
potential motherboard issues, there is a thread somewhere here that
discusses the possible fixes, they may apply to you as well.  The best
solution I am aware of for your sound issues, is to replace your sound card,
can't recommend one in particular though.
