I tried the new server a couple of days ago.  I knew it was bad when
Neriak inner area had 30 people in it.  I went out to the Forest and
there were 125.  Lifespan of garter snake was maybe 3 seconds.

Way too many people for me.

I did see a level 29 Beastlord killing guards.  But the vast majority
were under 5th level.
