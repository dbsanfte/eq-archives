Sounds to me like someone who's never been to Uqua ;)

One person in your raid dies - any person - and it spawns a ghost. If
that ghost, possibly now untanked, kills another person, it spawns
a second ghost. And so on.

You're also hit by an AE that gives about neg 250 to all stats. The
mobs force fast heals so your healers need huge mana pools and mana
regen... but the AE has just destroyed that. You can collect items to
block the AE... but if you die, or zone, or breath funny, the items
vanish.

Essentially, you cant fuck up. And every single person matters, as
you're limited to a 54 person raid that has to split into 2 parts
and fight two nameds simultaneously at one point, not to mention
the numerous traps that bring 5-6 mobs at once down on you, all udner
the threat of a single death causing cascade ghost-popping.

Its a great deal of fun, and challenging... but to suggest that
gear doesnt matter to raids is really to state 'I havent raided
content that challenges my raid party'. AFK-zombie-bot-raider syndrome
sets in once raid content is deep in farm status, but unless you're
waiting for the next expansion and have 'won' EQ, the gear and
attention thresholds of your guildies are very very important
indeed.

Well, if you can progress and theres things to do whats to complain
about? Lack of glamour? Lack of interest? I still have fun levelling
my alts up and such, are you just feeling you're stuck with 'no more
progression routes' or something?

My main has about 450-500AA at the moment and pretty decent gear. Raiders
run out of content to progress too... Thats the nature of the game , we
eat it faster than they can make it. *shrug* If you dont want to repeat
content play city of heroes till OOW is out, its what I do sometimes ;)

What makes it (un) interesting? Repetition? Lack of OMGZWOW factor
when showing off to others? For what its worth, Im still wearing
a kunark and a velious quest item and Im mostly geared in time/EP
stuff. I'm saving my DKP for some nice contested things, but its not
like 100hp items suck hideously, or that the quests for them were
appallingly tedious torture I inflicted upon myself for leet status...

While that can be true of an individual raider it cant be true
of the majority of your raid force if you're in a genuinely top
end raiding guild - the content punishes mistakes until the next
expansion level cap and spells give a sufficient safety margin.
