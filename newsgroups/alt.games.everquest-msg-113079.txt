Ok, I keep running into this. I'll be in a group where the mobs are
plentiful, we have no problem pulling as much as we can handle. Maybe we're
already full and someone has to go, or maybe there are just 4-5 or us there.

Now personally, if my group has an opening and you are LFG, I think it's
just common courtesy to let you join in the fun even if we don't HAVE to
have you. But that isn't what I'm describing, I'm talking about places where
we CANNOT keep all the mobs cleared from our area, Places where we sit to
med and heal and watch as the mobs walk by.

I see someone else LFG whose class and level would fit in our group and ask
the group if its ok to add this person. Alot of the time the reply I get is
"no, we're doing ok, we don't need a 6th person".

I try to explain to them that there is a slight XP bonus so you get more XP
for every person you add, that having more people means we'll be able to
kill MORE mobs which gives us MORE XP, having another person means that we
wont have to go looking for another if someone has to leave, I even say
Having a 6th means we'll be safer, less chance we will wipe out.

Still, most of the time, these people say, no, we're fine, adding another
just means we'd get less XP.

What do you think?
