 Lot of people have tried a lot of things. As far as I'm concerned the
'master key' of HS is a myth until I see it posted and do it myself. 

 Oh, and the rusty/rotbone items don't fit in the container.

 Also there are more than 4 keys that I can recall:

North key entrance - ravener mobs
North end zone - Ground spawn
West key entrance - North end boss
West end zone - Ground spawn
South key entrance - West end boss
South key end - Ground spawn

 And that's it since East isn't locked. My guess would be that it would
involve the two keys from the wing bosses along with two other items.
The good thing now is you can experiment all you want since the change
where your items wouldn't get eaten if they don't combine.
