I always sell them to merchants.  They're technically a nice
weapon, but they're so overshadowed by other easy-to-get Kunark
weapons that no one would bother to use one.

The best place to get answers to questions like these is www.eqprices.com

And it's well worth paying the small fee to subscribe, because the
user discussions attached to most items (as well as the
subscriber-only page of price detail information) really help you
to understand how likely you are to get the "average" price listed
on the first (free, no-subscription-necessary) page of info.

Eqprices.com says 130p (on average) for the Giant Foreman's Tunic,
and 30p for the Lumberjack's Cap.

The Lumberjack's Cap is actually quite nice as a mid-level "helmet".
The only reason it goes for only 30p (or so) is because they drop
so often that they're the proverbial dime-a-dozen -- most people
who could use one already have one.
