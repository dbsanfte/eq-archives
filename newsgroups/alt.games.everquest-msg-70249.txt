I would caution Jazz against blanket saying wizards suck, cause I can
tell you with a fact that post 50 Wizards rock.  0-49 is hard but its
worth it in the end, trust me.

I used to give the same advice as Jazz...  Playing a wizard is not for
everyone, it is easily THE most one dimensional character out there,
even beating Warriors for that title.

On the other hand, the class HAS gotten a lot of fixes lately.  I dont
know that I can necessarily say that starting a wiz these days is as
fun as starting a mage or necro, but its better than when I did it.

Anyone considering starting a wiz would be well advised to check
www.graffe.com and see the kinds of issues that wizzies are facing.
