That faint swooshing sound was my point passing high over your
head.  I'm not sure why I care, but I'll explain:
Hyperbole is sometimes useful.  Argument by analogy, which you
attempted, is not the same thing and is usually fruitless.
Lokari's reply to you was an excellent example of the one
consistent exception I've seen to that:  a well chosen counter-
analogy does an excellent job of debunking an attempt to argue
by analogy.

You are only half right.  You've figured out the "there's not really
too much to debate" part.  The second assertion you make is false.
VI makes the rules by which we play, and your position is counter
to VI's, and thus false.  When you deliberately drop stuff you have
discarded it, regardless of your intent.  The OP stole nothing.  If
you want to transfer gear with little or no risk you can either get
a second account or get help from a trusted friend.  If you drop
transfer the risk is yours, nobody is obliged to aid you in any way.
And, if you do something so stupid as to try to drop transfer in a
high traffic area, the person who inevitably picks up the items that
you discarded has done you and everybody else a favor by providing
you with a powerful lesson that we can hope will motivate you to be
less stupid in the future.
