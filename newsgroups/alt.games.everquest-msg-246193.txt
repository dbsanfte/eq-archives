Granted the regen/Bind Wound changes don't affect me what so ever in
the high end raiding guild level of the game...  It's hardly dumbing
down.  Newer players or players who generally don't pay attention to
patching news or other EQ Information will have to ask around or take
close notice to the regen changes.  I can see it in some point in the
future... "Come on guys, let's get a healer!  We can't sit around and
regen super slow all day!" from one person, and the other players will
be like "Just sit down, you'll regen faster.  And didn't you practice
your bind wound skill?".  Dumbing down is something like making it so
you don't need to practice Sense Heading to have it at max skill, or
starting the game with everything eqiupped plus a bag, your spells
memmed, etc, as opposed to starting out cluelessly, no maps, no NPC
guides, nothing equipped, having to start from one end of a city on
creation to figure out your way to the guild master to hand in your
note...
