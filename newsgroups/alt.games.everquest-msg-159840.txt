Same reason people use mad instead of angry.  Mad actually means crazy for
those that don't know, the Mad Hatter wasn't an angry little guy, he was
crazier than a 2-legged cat running through a greyhound track.  Kid is
actually a young goat, not a human offspring.  And my personal favorite,
faggot means a bundle of sticks used to light/start a fire.  Of course we
can't forget the word niggardly (best damn word in the English dictionary
and no one can use the damn thing because too many people don't realize what
it means) but I'll leave that definition for the reader to find.

I am a grammar conservative.  I use all ready, not already or allready, I
use comma's all the way through the series, and I like to use words with
their initial meaning.  Unfortunately, Americans more so than others,
bastardize the English language to a point where most generations below X,
have no clue as to what a word actually means and instead feel that slang or
lingo is an acceptable use in writing and speaking.
