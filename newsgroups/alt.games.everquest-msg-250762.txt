Another thought I keep having is, if a normal old school game's cycle is 
  "make x year one, make .5X year two, make .01x year three" then 
doesn't it make a lot more sense to hang onto a game which is still 
making x every year, even if it once made 4x?

Release a new Old School game and you are looking at revenues of 1.6x, 
over the next three years.  Support EQ for the same amount of effort and 
  in the same 3 years you expect 3x.  Flat looks better than the old 
school plan, which pretty much guaranteed declining revenue.

But thats just me.
