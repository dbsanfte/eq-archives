Just out of curiosity, what do you think is the hardest class to play?
Hmm let's be specific, hardest class/race combo to play.
Can be due to character complexity issues (just so hard to do all the things
I gotta do) or less tangible reasons (nobody likes my character)
Is it the Ogre Shadowknight, with his massive racial penalties?
The Human Ranger, with his mediocre stats?
Any races bard, with all the instrument, weapon, and song swapping?
The Iksar Necro, with his horrible faction penalties?
hold on a second
(sounds of hilarity)
ok I'm back now.

So what class/race? I'm trying to decide what my choice would be... but I
want to see some others opinions.
