Two examples of me pulling a mob that was already damaged (had wiped a group
or beat down a kiter or something).

[Sat Sep 18 16:26:17 2004] a girplan stonecrafter says 'You will not evade
me Faned!'

me Faned!'
[Sat Sep 18 22:41:41 2004] a discordling enchainer says 'You will not evade
me Faned!'

Both of these were me running it back to my group to kill, with nothing to
distract it between summons.  So, must be tick based to have that sort of
variance in time between summons.

Looking at other summons in my logs, six seconds appears to be the minimum
time between summons.  Maximum is harder to discern, but probably about 12
seconds (in other words, getting lucky on the tick).
