It wrong and incorrect to compare the Kamakazi to terrorists. 

The Kamakazi were attempting to sheild their friends and families, not
strike fear into a nation. The Kamakazi attacked military targets NOT
civilians. It was an act carried out durring the course of a declared
War.

The Japanese resorted to Kamakazi attacks as a last resort in an
attempt to hold back the American carrier fleets from the home
islands. The act itself was offensive, but the motivation was purely
defensive. Japan expected a full scale amphibious invasion. US
estimates of American casualties were in the hundreds of thousands.
Estimated Japanese deaths were in the millions.

I am not taking Japans side in the war. I am merely pointing out that
from their point of view, they had very little choice.

If you want to draw comparisons to terrorists and the combatants in
WWII, turn your attention to the terror-bombing of London and Berlin
that was directed specifically at the civilian population.
