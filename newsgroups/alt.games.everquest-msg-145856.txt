I just tried Necro/Druid combo that worked pretty good.

I hotkeyed the Druid and fear kited with the Necro. I started the
other way around and ended up with a dead Necro twice.

Druid sow Necro 
Necro Darkness pull
Send Pet
Druid Dot
Necro Fear (continue as needed)
Necro Nuke at 50

If mob resisted fear it would aggro Druid which gave me time to recast
fear without mob on me. I didn't have any deaths and downtime wasnt
bad. I'll play around with it a little more and see if I can improve
downtime and time it takes to drop mob.
