Crypt of Betrayal is not exactly a hotspot for grouping.  Mind you, 
second time I went there I got an AQ4 group, and we knocked that out, 
then proceded to crawl through CoB and had a great time.  TS is one place 
I never have any trouble getting a group, not always able to find one for 
any one specific quest, but, I try to keep multiple quests going for the 
area I am in, so that killing most anything there will advance at least 
one quest.  Aside from that, I also do a lot of writs there, all soloable 
stuff, including the group encounter gnolls.  In fact, I soloed almost 
all of AQ5 now, just have the swarm beetles to go, and they just are too 
large a group for me to solo.  Generally, if I put LFG up, I get an 
invite within 5 minutes maximum.  I don't always accept blindly, but, 
finding a group is really not a problem, if you go to a popular zone.  If  
you insist on going to a zone where almost noone goes, then, finding a 
group will indeed be difficult.
