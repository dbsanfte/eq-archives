I just read the emails on Lum, and what irks me is that the official
reaction was scaled up so dramatically. People use geography at Naggy
and Vox and virtually never get their fingers slapped (on that matter,
it seems stupid to have dragons in a cave, with tunnels they can't get
to, and NOT be allowed to use that to prevent the dragon from getting
to you (not that I've ever seen a dragon lair)) they used stacking
spells on other uberdragons before with no reaction other than seeing
the spell stacking altered a couple of days later, they know other
guilds do the same thing, they use these tactics on an even bigger mob
and are losing - and instead of the stacking effect being removed the
next day,  being warned about the terrain exploit or told to leave the
zone, boom! Suspensions, 2 players banned, and no more guild.
Disbanding the guild seems especially wrong to me.

Quoth Brad: "And it remains our opinion that exploiting these types of
encounters severely cheapens the game experience for others. So we
came down pretty hard on you all."

Punishing Conquest like this has cheapened the game experience for me
much more than even a successful exploiting fight against the 4th
warder ever could have done, whether or not I'll actually ever see the
inside of a place like ST.
