Right, sorry, i forgot to mention this :(
I always had some teleport guy in the group, so getting out has never
been a problem. But if you have some teleport guy with you, check it
out. I don't think that DP or some other similar zone would reach the
experience of this dungeon. With a few levels more and also a gater you
could also try the Droga or Nurga. The experience there is also great
and there are also some named mobs in with some nice items.
Good hunting!
