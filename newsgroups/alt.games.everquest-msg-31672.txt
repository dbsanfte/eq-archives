It displays a lack of respect for the environment the creators
established and for his fellow players' desire to play in that
environment.

If they think it goes on any less with a law prohibiting it, they are
sadly naive. If they are not forced bear witness, they have no
business concerning themselves with it, anyway.

Lessening enjoyment of the game.

It's a totally invalid one and you're desperately digging for an angle
that makes it valid.

No comment here, I see...

Not that it makes it right... THEY are not to blame for childish
attitudes. The "resentment" only "begins to grow" in those childish
enough to not understand the difference between "player" and "GM"...

Yes, I mentioned naming policy. In regards to the names. I never
mentioned anything related to the EULA in regards to you criticizing.

Insanely, patheticly desperate, Dan. It was such an absurd strech, you
should be emberassed to show yourself here...

They consider me one because I hold an opinion of the policies that
they disagree with? Rather petty, don't you think? There's a massive
difference between "not disagreeing with their policies" and "kissing
their ass".
