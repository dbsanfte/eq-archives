For comparisson,  a "fighting" 60 shaman (as opposed to the
buffing/debuffing/healing shaman) can put out about 60 dps in Dots, +
25 dps with buffed 55 pet (haven't seen the data of the new 61 pet).
This is sustained DPS with using the runtime of the dots to recover
mana via canni. To that he can add about 100 DPS in nuke mode.
