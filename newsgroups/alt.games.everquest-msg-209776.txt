At what lvl does a Nec have the ability to use the Bind Affinity spell (if
he can at all).

I am getting really tired of having to run 3,4,5 zones to find my body, that
some Zombie Trooper smashed in to the ground.

and is there a place where I can print off all the Acronyms that are used, i
know some but not all, and i would hate asking over and over, i'm sure that
would piss off more that just one person.

Raverex
lvl-10.5 ( as if the .5 make any dif)

"experience is the one thing you never have, until just after you need it"
(i.e. like that Zombie Trooper smashing me in to the ground)
