New UI?  Did you change the bitsperpixel (something like that) from 16 to 32
in eqclient.ini like they recommended?

Does the problem go away when you turn off the new UI (you may have to edit
eqclient.ini to turn it off)?

www.everquestlive.com  Take a look at the tech support forum, chances are
your problem is touched on there.  Please report back to say what fixed it.
