I've run into Graven Image a few times .. There are some kewlio names. There
are some idiots. There are some nice, normal people too.

I'd look for a guild that supports your play style. If you play on strange
times (ie, you're from Europe or whatever) then La Horde may be the one for
you. If you're into roleplaying, look for a roleplaying guild.

I'll try to say hi if i see you in Tribunal. =)
