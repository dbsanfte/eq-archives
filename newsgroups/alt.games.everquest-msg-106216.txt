Well, I was getting a tad old on the spirocs so for my long saturday session
I decied to dust off some of the stripped "small change" characters that
were also on the Gimps account. I found there was a stripped 43 warrior who
only had 1hs as a worked on weapons skill so quickly discarded that. There
was also a stripped 21wood elf Bardette though, and that definately drew my
attention. I have always found bards fun to play, albiet poorly as I have
<really> bad motor skills.

So onto the Bard I threw all of that heavy clunky Etched Iron plate I had
been collecting for just such a purpose, with a couple of Orc Fang earrings,
Jagged Bands and a Blackened Alloy Coif topping up the strength to make all
that hardware wearable. Weapons were a SSOY and an Ebon Razor I borrowed
from my baby ranger.

First thing that struck me was how crippled these obviously powerleveled
characters were, first the useless 43 warrior then finding out the Bard with
110 offense skill only had 35 defense. I guess the lazy twinks come to rely
solely on whatever uber gear they throw at their characters and forget about
skills. Anyway, swapping the Jagged Bands for my prize possession pair of
Velium Fire Wedding rings and back into the Paludal I went hoping to get
bashed around like hell.

I had been soloing the Mushies for a while and working up the defense when
in pops a Level 15 monk ooc'ing that they were LFG...in english mind you -
correctly spelled and all. Knowing they were too young for the Paludal, and
unable to get through the Paludal to easier grounds I decided to take them
under my meagre (22 by this stage) wing.

So - I taught them how to get by the first bandit camp, stressing exactly
why they do not want to go *through* it and showed them the two Mushy
spawns. I pulled out the mandolin and just healed them as they fought the
blues to yellows, disbanding before the killing stroke so they got full XP
from each. After an earlier accident (hey - I was a Bard, not a Cleric) I
shouldered the Mandolin and swatted the red (to her) mushies myself, sharing
the XP.

Turns out she was a nice person - her husband plays the game as a 50+ ranger
and he dropped by occassionally to give her some extra buffs and make sure
all was fine...I think he was understandably concerned in leaving her in the
hands of a Bard of all classes : ) She was hardly a "leet" player - she
paniced when things got busy and did some of the funniest things, but then
again so do I - all the time actually....(normally resulting in spectacular
exaples of self culling in my case). After a few hours I managed to get her
a safety margin into level 17 where she could get her feign death and have a
fighting chance. I also upgraded some of her stingier gear - a polished
steel for her heavy steel ulak and some of the dark muslin I had been
picking up from Runneyeye. Plus a Worn Cloth Mantle (think thats the name,
6ac, 5 str and 9 agi, really light anyway) I had found cheap on a vendor one
day.

When I bid her farewell - a 24 warrior was ooc'ing he was hopelessly lost in
the Paludal and without the health to move any further. Since I was pretty
tanked (beerwise) by this stage I decided to break my anti social mold and
go rescue him. I got his loc, equipped a flute, invis'ed and eventually
stumbled onto him,  leading him to safety and healing him up.

He teamed up with a 25 monk that was there and together they took the now 17
monk under their wings for some more serious carnage. I hung around out of
the group at the first mushy, providing a casual downtime healing service
for them. I ended up giving my second polished steel ulak to the 25 monk as
he had no h2h weapons at all, and was falling behind in that skill. Every
now and again we were trained in our healing huddle, so I ended up getting a
little XP and learning how to twist 2 songs, heal and haste (without
swapping instruments tho). Somewhere along the way I dinged 23 before
everyone got tired as it was after 5 am in the USA where they were.

So, that's where I find myself now. Thinking back over the day and realising
I enjoyed myself immensly. No dragons were slain. No uber gear was obtained.
No warring with drOOds. Just a very clumsy ebayed baby bard on a full tank
of beer and an empty tank of skill, but somehow actually doing a bit of good
and having fun to boot : )

Oh - I had to have my daily evil grin at somebodies expense today - so i
chose her 50+ Ranger husband as the victim. I got her to memorise the
following line:

    "If you love me you will buy me a Fungal Tunic"

*grins evilly*
