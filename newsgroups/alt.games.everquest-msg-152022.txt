Bards would rarely die if they stuck to what they can do best.  Everyone
says bards=group...BAH!  Bards can group and have a lot of fun, but bards
own at kiting.  The majority of your songs don't require mana and as such
you can keep singing them over and over again.  This works exceptionally
well when you get to higher levels you can do swarm kiting or when you get
your long duration run song you can chant kite things to death with ease.
Play a bard if you like to be completely immersed in what you are doing, not
because they can do this or that.  Bards require pretty much your full
attention in order to twist, run, fight, and entertain :p
