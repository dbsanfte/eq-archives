Still down at 7:25 am EST, which would be 4:25 am Pacific, or 8 hours 25 
minutes past their estimated completion time.

Login lists it as Down, while there's another server listed as Locked, 
I'm not sure what the difference is or why we'd care which is which.

I blame myself for the outage, of course, since I went and bought GOD, 
naturally they've shut down the server I play on.  Wandered in there 
with my bard just to peek about, but I'm in no shape to play a bard at 
all well at the moment, having left him alone for most of a year, it 
will take a while to redevelop the instincts and skills needed to do 
even a half decent job of it.

I guess I'll go start a berserker somewhere, just to get a look at the 
class.

Splendid, 65 arch convoker gnome, down on FV
Llyric, 57 bard who can't play more than one song at a time
