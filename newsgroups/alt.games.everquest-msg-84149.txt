Does anyone have a price on a Enchanted Fine Steel Morning Star?  Stats are
+2 Str +5 Wis 7 Dmg 30 Dly.  On my server EC seems the place to sell while
on other I'm told G'Fay is better.  I'd just like a round about price I've
been told from 200pp - 500pp sure alot of it depends on the server, as well
as supply and demand.  Though I posted this question earlier, but it never
got picked up any help as always is appreciated.

Fred
