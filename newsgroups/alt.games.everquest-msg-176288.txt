Nope - I did pre-order as of the 16th.  I had assumed a phased go-live
because they were going to release files via the patcher piecemeal rather
than on one day which would clog up the login system for several days.

After turning on my brain I see the go live is deep into Feb.  Thanks all
for the clarification
