I did some research, as I havent run across RedSheriff yet. It seems that it
is a sneaky bugger, which is why it gets past ZA by default. Because its
just a java applet that runs in your browser, and it uses port 80, anything
it sends looks like its coming from an approved application - iexplore.exe
or whatever. The only way to block it using your firewall is not allow your
computer to connect to specific IPs, which takes some work. TPW does let you
do this, I assume ZA does too but I dont know...

You cant find specific RedSheriff IP address info here (sorry about the
wrapping):

This also contains a link to a list of spyware IPs, which is
http://www.geocities.com/yosponge/blockips.txt . This even seems to have
instructions for adding them to TPW, but it calls it "Kerio Personal
Firewall". I dunno, but the intructuions match...
