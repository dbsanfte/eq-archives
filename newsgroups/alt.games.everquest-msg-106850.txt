Well I haven't yet - this level of PC was fairly new to me despite having
worked in the industry for 25+ years :P - and EQ is to blame! I will be
getting some round cables next time I order something. I am guessing that
the Summer heat will tell me if I still have a problem!

Incidentally, something else for people to check is proximity of heat
sources and clearance round the machine - having the monitor too close,
tucking it in a cupboard, neither will help. The thing that finally
convinced me that heat was my problem was when I went down to my Brother's
for a weekend and took the PCs. Where we set up, the machine was quite close
to a radiator, and the shutdowns happened far more frequently. Moving it
just 18 inches away brought it back down to normal levels.
