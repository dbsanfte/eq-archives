Well, the giants have better quest armour, but the coldain have the
ring and shawl.  Killing giants will also give you faction increases
with both Coldain and the dragons, so you get two nice factions while
ruining only one (assuming you're planning on killing for faction and
not just buying quest drops).

Thurgadin is also closer to a PoK book, and the Coldain have a nifty
gate potion for those who don't have a gate spell already.

Most Velious dragons are on Claws of Veeshan faction[1], which you
increase by slaughtering Kromzek and Kromrif.  There is also Yelinak
faction[2], which you increase by killing King Tormax and some other
named giants in his area.  Some of the dragons in Temple of Veeshan
(the ones in the north wing) are on Guardians of Veeshan faction[3],
but you can't raise that faction so they will always hate you.
