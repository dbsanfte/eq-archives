Mostly something with wis or mana on it I think so you can nuke the critter
for the last couple of hp's.

I've not played a druid beyond lvl 15, but by then I was lucky to have
gotten a War Claw Somethingoranother of 8/22 or so. Maxed 1hs within the
first 5 minutes of dinging :)

Also might want to auction for a Smoldering Brand. 9/22 1hb which is a
common drop in The Hole (common as in 2 hole raids in 2 days and we had to
let 3 brands rot because everyone, 18 peeps, had one) (well we didn't let
them rot, Jabober looked like a lantarn). I usually give any I have on me to
nearby newbies, but it's a great weapon to get 1hb up in no time. Last time
I saw one in EC (month or so ago) it went for 50pp.

Anyway, just let your mana do the work. dot-rot works well, or you might try
to more unconventional tactic of charming mobs.

And after level 29 I think you can switch to quadkiting and never worry
about melee again.
