As a Warrior, Druids and Wizards are always asking to port me and the
other casters are always wanting to bind me. For bind, I absolutely
refuse donations for letting the caster bind me. For 'ports, I
ususally don't accept donations, but sometimes the 'porter is
insistant and I allow them to donate up to 25pp for letting them port
me.
