Hi,

I just got my first PDA that is based on the PocketPC
OS (WinCE 3.0 I belive) and I'm looking for some EQ
related software for it.

I had a couple of databases on my old Palm OS machine,
but I'm having a very hard time locating EQ stuff for
the PocketPC.  Mostly, all I'm finding is the official
"Pocket EQ" that was released by Sony and is an actual
game.  I'd like to have item databases, character tools,
and anything else to keep me entertained while I am stuck
in boring meetings at work ;^)

Any pointers would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike
