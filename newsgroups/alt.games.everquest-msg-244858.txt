His problem seems to be that he defines family guilds as those unable to
raid X content.    Either that or he's just plain wrong in making his
generalization.

The guild I considered joining with my rogue was one such.   They would do
"Tuesday night" joint raids with another small guild, and between the two of
them had a pretty impresive list of things that they could kill, even
several months ago.  (Thier website is down or moved since I last checked
it, so at the moment so I can't see how far they've gone since then.)

They were done with NToV and Kael, including AoW.    In Luclin they would
kill Shei, Burrower and every mob in Ssra up to Emporer.   (Not because they
couldn't, more lack of keys. In the months since then, I wouldn't be
suprised to learn they had killed Emp, VT and Seru, but as I said, I can't
check at the moment.)   PoP kills that I know of include TT, MB, TZ, VZ, AD,
HoH trials (less RD), Saryn, Agnarr and the Bertoxx event.    I wouldn't be
suprised to hear they had killed RD and MM since then.    I'm not sure they
had the pure numbers to take out RZ themselves, but hearing they attempted
it would not suprise me.  (Hearing they killed it would suprise, but not
shock me :)  )

The smaller family guild that they partnered with would do Sol Ro tower
bosses pretty regularly, but I'd imagine they're beyond that now. (by small,
I mean 8 - 12 active members, at most.) .  The small guild was about 90%
Elemental flagged.   The larger family guild (the one that invited me) was
more like 25 - 30% Elemental flagged, from going on public raids.   (And I'd
be suprised if those numbers aren't higher by now.)

This was before GoD came out, so I dont' know what they do or have attempted
there.

For them, being a "family guild" was clearly a choice.  They did not kill
less due to lack of skills or even lack of gear (And _certainly_ not lack of
AA's.  Heh.), they killed less because as a guild they didn't want to go out
raiding that often.
