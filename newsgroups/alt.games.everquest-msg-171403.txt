Well, you can get hardcore min/maxish and use that formula to calculate
for each piece you have. But a general rule of thumb seems to be that
you will get more bang for your buck by using +MANA gear up until around
your mid twenties, and then start switching your focus to +INT items.

Remember that how much mana you get for each point of INT changes once
your INT goes over 200, so in some slots you will still want to look at
the option of getting big +MANA items there.  The ideal choice, of
course, is any item that you can lay your  hands on that has both. I'm
trying to recall what my wizard epic has for those stats... but anyway
it's a bunch of both and it's pretty nice.

Spend some time in the bazaar, and don't jump on and buy the first thing
you see (unless it's some insanely good bargain). It will be worth it.
Just open the bazaar window and fill in all the filters for your class,
race, max price you are willing to spend, and specify +MANA in the Type
field.

Keep refreshing it and get an idea for the prices per point of INT or
Mana on items, and you'll find some deals eventually. You may initially
want to filter it down to just the slots that you still have cloth in
until you get those beefed up a bit.

If you've got the time to spend and a good connection, nothing wrong
with that.
/shrug

Can be a dangerous game, though, if you get stuck with a big ticket item
that you thought was a good idea and suddenl the price on them plummets.
