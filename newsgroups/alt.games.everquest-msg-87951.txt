It's really up to your style of game play. Yes, it's possible level up
without camping anything. You can perform quests to get XP. You can solo
travel, fight the passing MOB, explore new places in areas where it's at
least relatively safe to be alone. Or, you can group for an evening with
some people to travel or gang-up on a larger spawn. I *never* sit down with
the intent of camping to catch a particular spawn. Hell, I don't usually
play more than about 2-3 hours at a time. During that time I want to see
scenery! I've read of people who sit and camp 18 or 24 hours for a spawn.
I'd lose my job (and probably my wife) if I did that. It simply means I
level-up probably slower than "average" but it's up to each person to figure
out what "average" means to them.
