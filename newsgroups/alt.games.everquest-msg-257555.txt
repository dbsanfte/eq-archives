Thanks Lance!  I suspected you would be the first to chime in. :)

I was geting hit for a round or three before the tank grabbed aggro back.  Not
terribly long.

I'm ashamed to say that I wasn't really watching.  I don't remember ever
getting desperately low, but I was paying more attention to dishing out damage
as fast as possible.  Rather than just assume that the healer has my back
covered, I should probably try to avoid coming on his radar at all, it seems.

This nixes my idea then.  If taunt isn't the primary way of getting aggro, then
this strategy is only useful for, perhaps, switching tanks in mid-battle
(passing off a bucket of long-time built up aggro).  I can't see this being
useful outside of a raid setting, or perhaps at much higher levels, if the mobs
take much longer to die.  Upon reflection, it now seems unwise for a DPS melee
(e.g. me) to race the tank up the hate list.  It's better off if everyone else
just shows restraint.
