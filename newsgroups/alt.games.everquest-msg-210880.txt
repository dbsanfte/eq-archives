I did most of my Shammy epic solo, but I see no way you can solo the
Hole portion of it, unless you did the faction trick.  When I say
solo, I mean nobody helped in any way, no cheats such as jumping in
the hole /q, etc...
I just don't see that, but most skip The Hole these days.

Fear is a tough one on my server, not so much for the fight, but for
the guilds who kill the golems as soon as they pop so they can
multi-quest the tear for $$$$ or keep on other characters for future
use. As for Rak, I wouldn't be too sure about just a mage and a
cleric.  I've heard about the fire pet trick, but always with a few
mages and some backup.  Maybe with levels now at 65 and AAs that's
changed.  And you still need a rogue with 200 lock pick to get to him,
no?
