well... lets see.  Tenebrous Mountains appears to have a Texture
swap...  The large boulders in zone are wearing the Palm Tree Frond
texture from the trees in the zone.  And the Palm Tree tops are
wearing the Bolder Textures.  Oh, and in any zone I go to, if someone
is in Wolf form they are wearing a mish mosh of textures.   The head
is of a wolf, the body looks to be striped like a Tiger,   very weird
indeed.
I verified it with others in zone and they were seen the graphics
issues as well. 

Anyone else having similar issues.?
