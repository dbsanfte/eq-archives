Between the testruns, very fast. 20mins maybe? We knew what we wanted to
test, and pre-arranged that my death would signal the camp call. No
discs were used, and few expendables.

On the full scale runs, it was 72 minutes between attempts. The recycle
time of Trueshot. We were ready to go well before then, but waited for
the extra damage.

About 7 hours total from first kill to Sleeper awake

10th or more I believe

I doubt the Naggy model is available in the Permafrost zone files. The
only dragon I actually heard spouting was Woushi warning people to get
the hell outta Skyshrine, shortly before Kerafym arrived. Others I heard
over /gu, through tells, from screenshots, or the like

One other guild killed the first 2 warders a few months ago, but they
fell apart, with a lot lost to DAoC. No warders have been killed by
anyone else for over a month. Firstbroods have been almost untouched
throughout that time. If anyone had put in a similar effort we did to
getting keys, they would've been killing warders regularly

We knew we'd always get flak, not least from the L23 part-timers who
would never have gone there anyway, and had nothing to gain from the
zone. Some people hate successful guilds unfortunately.

To some degree, I can understand future ST raider's annoyance. The
trouble is, there will ALWAYS be a 'next person'. For us, Luclin was the
motivating factor. When the expansion hits, attention will no doubt be
moved from Velious to the new moon's challenges. Just as TRak adn VS
were dumped like yesterday's newspapers when Veilous came. This was
something we've been 'umming' and 'ahhing' for months now. About a month
ago we had the final debate about pros and cons, and finally fixed a
date a couple of weeks ago.

Killing the 4th warder is buggy if you leave other warders up. You can
still set off a half cocked script. It was an option, but one we
investigated and decided against. Some people are bleating about how
they would've left other warders up 'for the good of the server' for
others to 'experience' ST. The zone is still there. ALL the mobs are
still there, apart from 5 dragons for now which using almost identical
models to WW trash. Kerafym was seem by a LOT more people by releasing
him, than if he was sat, static, in his bubble, accessible to only the
most elite. Hell, I tanked the warders all night, and STILL never got to
see Kerafym awake LOL. 

Primals still drop, albeit more rarely, but from zone trash rather than
just the last 4 warders. People can still get the 'ST Experience', all
they are losing are a couple of ST warder specific drops like SoD, Gnome
Mask, Staff of NooneWants, Writ of ECommons, etc. They wanted to farm
the warders for primal, just as we did, so the 'higher moral ground'
argument is moot. Instead of those drops, you now have the rare scale
drop, which give a range of 'essence' rewards from a quest in WW

Damned with a static world, damned with a dynamic world, I guess

The key problem is people want to do the biggest and the best, but
usually aren't willing to do the groundwork to get there. Months in the
planes pre-Kunark. Months of Trak/VS and Epics pre-Velious. Months of
first broods pre-Sleepers. Months of ToV pre-waking the sleeper. Just
because you've got a lot of L60, if you haven't done the prep work to
equip them, expect to always play second fiddle. I fully suspect that
once SoL is released, even on servers where the Sleeper is still
snoring, interest in ST will fall off rapidly as new stuff is
discovered. Look at Seb Juggs for spell gathering. Look at places like
Veeshan's Peak. The biggest guilds are always pilloried for monopolising
the best spawns, but when they move on, there's rarely anyone stepping
up to kill them with any regularity.

Hammer = Primal 1hb. Same stats as other primals. See Alla's or any
other loot list.

Rock = Green Resistance Stone. +35 poison +5 other resists range stone.
Each resistance has a specific stone, green only comes from 4th warder.

Shroud = Uber monkey tunic with fungal regrowth and amazing stats. The
real jewel in the ST crown. I'll see if I can dig out the stats

I agree. They should find a way to recage him. It was a mistake IMO to
make negative changes, without giving the dragon factioned a chance to
undo them if they so wish, but if no-one freed Kerafym, they'd have no
reason to re-cage him. Maybe as more servers let him loose, it'll become
more important to extend the storyline. If they're afraid of the same
guild cycling the sleeper up and down every weekend, just add an
unraisable faction you go KoS to if you kill warders. Would certainly
make sense for those on dragon faction to have a way of resurrecting
Yelinak to start the quest. Find an empty room in Skyshrine, fill it
with L70 dragons on that faction, along with a L70 Mystic. Start the
quest to summon a mob only killable if 50 PCs AND those L70 dragons join
forces. If you're KoS from killing warders, the dragons attack you
rather than the summoned mob, making it impossible for ST raiders to
recapture the Sleeper themselves

I'm sure there are problems with that idea, but I've just come up with
it off the top of my head ):oP
