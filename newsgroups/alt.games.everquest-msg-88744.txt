While that may be Verant's thinking, I think it's assinine.  They punish the
players who follow the rules for the sins of the exploiters.  Is the ability
to do that really worth the much more common case of LD deaths?  If that's
the philosophy for Verant's fixes, then I'd rather they stop fixing things.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
