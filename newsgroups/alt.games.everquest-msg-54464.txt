God, I hope we haven't come to the point in this newsgroup where one can
accuse Verant of total an utter bullshit such as Gestapo tactics (something
that has NEVER been their style, conspiracy theorists and paranoids aside)
and get AWAY with it.   I mean, Verant ain't perfect by a LONG shot but just
assuming the worst of them off the top of one's head is going overboard.
Verant is filled with as many professionals and nice people as most every
company (and as many idiots of course), including Mystic.

Ah, that's what gets me...I see anti-Verant posts..."Verant doesn't give a
shit about its customers," or "Verant doesn't listen."  Both are obviously
idiotic statements and seen a lot on the DAOC newsgroup (well, and here of
course).  If Verant didn't care then they would have Mythic's reputation for
putting out games and forgetting about them.
