How many quests have you done?  There are some REAL stomach turners in
Freeport.  Including some that involve killing completely innocent
people just because they've become a nuisance to the Freeport Militia.
 (One in particular happens out in the common lands and and starts
with a guard complaining about a woman who claims she hears ghosts.

She really does, shes NOT nuts, she just wants to be a left alone but
he doesn't care, he wants her dead and he'll pay you to cut her open.

Both cities have lots of rather "neutral" quests.  Run this from here
to there with some city flavor added in. IE a troll asking you to get
something for them is probably asking you to fetch something pretty
dang icky.  (Sometimes the things that are alluded too, well lets just
say I did NOT need that mental image!)  But once you get past those
delivery quests and especially if you READ all the dialog and story
provided some of the quests are DEFINATELY evil.

Perhaps the evil is a smaller, more personal, scale then you're
envisioning but they are quite simply EVIL.  (If you want to raze a
city to the ground you should probably play a war game, MMOs just
don't do that sort of scale for individuals, its just not practical.) 
The key is to really pay attention to the flavor text going on around
you, the dialog accompanying the quests, etc.  Its easy to gloss over
what's going on and say all the quests are "deliver x to y", "take
message a to npc b", "kill random npc x for npc m".  There is usually
a whole lot more too it.

For example.  There are quests that if you just click madly through
the conversation and run the errand seem like yet another "deliver a
message to npc x."  However if you pay attention to what is going on
you realize that there are multiple factions in FP, all back stabbing,
betraying, double crossing each other.  They'll gladly turn in a
member of an opposing faction to the Overlord for "seditous behavior".
 Often the charges are trumped up.  Sometimes its the NPCs "best
friend" or spouse who turns them in.

A couple times I've felt the betrayed deserved what he was getting and
gleefully delivered the damning report.  Other times I did it with a
twinge of regret to be turning in someone I'd done quests for and had
always been ok to me, or I felt DIDN'T deserve what they were getting.
 At least once I stood there with my mouth hanging open when I
realized an NPC I'd been helpign (because I thought he was part of a
faction I like who wants to ditch FP and retake Neriak) was actually a
MOLE for the Militia.  I wanted to STRANGLE him.

Evil is often more suble and inward turning than pillaging villages
and making war on the goodies.  (After all if you kill all your
villagers and burn their houses how the heck do they feed you and do
all the dirty work?)
