No you just need Gates of Discord, because that's the destination.

You do not need LDoN. Its sort of sad that few people even know how to 
get to Nedaria's landing without the ldon magi. Hint: its part of the 
oldworld continent of antonica. You don't need a boat to get there. You 
don't need a magus to get there.

You -do- need a magus to cross to abysmal or natimbi because there are 
no boats anymore... but nedarias landing is on "our" side of the ocean.

cheers
