Software companies *hate* selling stuff through physical stores, as opposed
to selling online, for either shipment of a box or download.  The way the
stores work is basically they rent shelf space to the software vendors.  The
stores do NOT buy the software and resell it.  If a box does not sell, it
gets sent back, and the store loses nothing.  The placement, display, and
promotion of items in the stores is paid for by the vendor--if the vendor
pays more, they get one of those fancy end displays, or top shelf.  If the
vendor pays less, they are on the bottom shelf out of sight.

When a customer does buy a box from a store, there is a chain of middle-men
between the customer's money and the vendor.  It takes a long time for the
money to reach the vendor, and there isn't much left after everyone on the
chain takes their cut.

So it was a real mystery why Sony would do something that would *encourage*
people to buy from stores rather than download.  I can think of two
explanations:

1. Expansions on the store shelves make EQ look more attractive to the
potential new player browsing in the stores, so might increase sales of the
basic game.  Also, some people can't download and don't like to order
online, so they need some in the store anyway.  Might as well do something
to ensure that they will actually sell--a sale, even with the long delay in
getting the money and the large amount taken by the middle men, is still
better than a return.

2. It let them test giving characters items that are obtained through an
out-of-game process, as a test in preparation for someday getting into the
item selling business.

I suspect it was a mix of these two, and so will not be surprised at all if
they actually do start selling items.
