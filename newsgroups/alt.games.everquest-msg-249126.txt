I remember the first time I saw a gnome. I was born in Surefall. It
was a *really big deal*. Everyone was like 'Woah, WTF are *you*?!'
and she was happily running around preening at being unique and
something we'd never seen. Now this was, of course, years ago,
pre-kunark when the Gorge and Highpass were genuine blockades to
world travel but you're right; the inconvienience of those
blockades made things exciting, novel, and the crossing of them
a real achievement.
