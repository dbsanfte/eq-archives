Ok I can accept that, but you still Stole the Wizards camp no matter how you
twist it. You have no honor and if I found out someone in our guild had done
something as despicable as that I would remove them from the guild without a

associated with, wither he was there for 1 min before you or 4 hours.
As I stated earlier your Class fits your personality a thief with no honor
