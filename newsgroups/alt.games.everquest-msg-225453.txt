I generally do not like bringing up actual names in complaints in public
like this, but I gotta say, this guy...  I can't tell if Davbow is just not
very good at telling what's pulled/agro'd already, or if he just feels like
he's got emminent domain over the giants or what.

I've crossed him at least once or twice as well, and I've seen him get into
it with folks at least twice in the past few weeks.  The guy needs to either
back off or buy a few clues, including /assisting the mobs.

And last I checked with /guildstat, he had no guild tag.

Dangit, Biz, I gotta find you one of these days.
