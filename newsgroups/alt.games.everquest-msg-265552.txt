    Heading from the pool towards the Bazaar zone, you pass an open 
courtyard once you get past the dome that leads to the DRU/SHM trainers. 
Just behind you is a choke point where the tinkering vendor is located. In 
the courtyard is a tent with a gnome vendor, a door leading to the fletching 
vendors, and another door. That "other door" is the way to the casino. 
Behind the door is an Innkeeper IIRC, and literally behind the door when you 
open it is a waitress/server/somethingorother. She sells the gold tokens 
(100 pp each) you hand to the gambling NPCs to play. Nearby is a set of 
stairs leading down. Go down them to reach the gambling NPCs.
