That's not what I meant to say. besides, Complete Heal etc have a
lower taunt factor that Greater Heal and such (from what I heard). It
depends on the spell. I just wanted to demonstrate how easy it can
be to aggro things with spells.

Nitpicky. Of course not, but you know what I mean. I've seen postings
comparing an Ogre warrior with uber equipment to a lower level DE
warrior with normal stuff. I'ts that what I mean ... don't deconstruct
every sentence into soemthing, engage thinking.

Er, he doesn't want to in this situation.

Yes. As much as I met a lot of groups, who didn't know a Shaman can heal with
the exact same spells at about the same levels as a druid. Knowledge of non
trivial classes ( A warrior hits, A cleric heals) is not very widespread.
