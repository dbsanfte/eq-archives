I can't get Magelo to display at work or at home, dunno why and
haven't felt it important enough to try and figure it out.
(using Netscrape 6.x both places)

You might have to give up a couple AC to lower weight I suppose, but
if you can gain enough HP (130 from the pair of rings) it ought to
be well worth it.  My warrior twink (who's on a tight budget since
he's rarely played, so I know he's not really comparable to your
main) wears no gear that's extraordinarily heavy (no granite
spaulders, for instance) and wears a couple pieces of Spider Fur
(I think name is right, 0.0 weight 10 ac neck and back with a little
bit of of stats/saves on them) which helps a ton in keeping his
weight under control.  I might finally upgrade the "monk" pieces
now that I'm using the stat food+drink tho, gives me more margin.  :)

Another option, depending on how much stuff you like to carry around,

would be to replace one or two of your handmade backpacks with tailored
bags (wt 0.8, 6 large slots, 10% weight reduction) or tailored belt
pouches (wt 0.6, 6 medium slots, 10% weight reduction).  I've used those
on all my characters for quite some time.  Of course, the characters
who're using stat food/drink replaced their feedbags with handmade
backpacks now because they need a few more slots and they've got
more strength.


I should also mention Thunder Etched Gauntlets (wt 0.0, 20ac, +1 all
resists).  I realize you probably don't want to give up 5ac (Cobalt
Gaunts are ac25, right?), but if the Velium Fire Rings (6ac 65hp)
give more ac than the rings you're wearing this could be a net upgrade
(and you can bank your Cobalt until you get STR increase or weight
reduction from another source that lets you go back to them).

Good Luck, I hope this helps
