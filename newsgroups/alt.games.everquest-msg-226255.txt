How?  Are you entitled to the Making of X2 bonus disc?  If they never
release it, would you be upset?  Dunno, if I bought the X2 Movie (which I
couldn't care less about), I would have done so under the understanding that
what's promised on the cover is what I'm buying.  Maybe it's just me, but as
long as they're delivering what they promise, I can't call it abuse.
