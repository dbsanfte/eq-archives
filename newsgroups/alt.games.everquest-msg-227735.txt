HoH is definitely great, but Jazz is still 61.  PoS frogs would be ideal I
should think, since there is actually room to kite there, but it is of
course somewhat contested.  Not wretchedly so, but it's not a camp you can
rely on always being there for you.  (Ok, my guildies are gonna kill me
now, since frogs are their favorite duo spot.)

I should think that Veksar would be *very* viable for a Necro...if you
google, you should be able to find a discussing on a.g.e regarding necros
soloing well in this zone.  Don't see why they couldn't add a wizard
without much fuss.  Just a shame that golems aren't undead, because the
named golem drops a pretty nice ID3 wrist.  That's one of my favorite
camps in Veksar, lots of chain-pulling fun, so I'd go there with you
two...but I won't be around much till January. :(

Though your wife might also like the camp where the "cast summon companion
from inventory" waist drops...I never did that, but my understanding is
that it is all undead, single pulls, and there's a little
wiggle-space.  I'd have to ask a friend more about that one.
