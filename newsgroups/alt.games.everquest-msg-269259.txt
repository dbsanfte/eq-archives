I have the gnome one, I started that one first (being a gnome and
all). Which was the spot? Was that the one down in the depths of one
of the commonlands dungeons behind a locked door?

IIRC I managed to get to part 3 of the dwarf one, and it is sending me
to Feerrott. I'm not sure anyone on the server has even done that
access quest, let alone me.

I wonder what the rewards are like.
