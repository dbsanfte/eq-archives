Lacking Harmony, root, SOW (outside of a bottle) and the ability to 
snare multiple incomings, plus having a throw range of only 150, I'm not 
too sure I agree with you about rangers, at least not outdoors

But since you didn't mean ranger, I'll have to think.

Lets see, I don't have hide and sneak, so its hard for me to tell whats 
in that room I'm about to pull, and I can't throw and then hide so only 
the mob that I hit "see's" me, to single pull.  I'm not sure thats how 
that trick is done or if it really works, but it does seem like a pull plan.

Paladins, with Lull and archery range and the very low aggro Cancel 
Magic available to pull with certainly beat berserk pull.  Not to 
mention they too have root so as to serve as their own CC if needed.

SK, with the FD you mention plus invis and snare, can take a look first, 
and can pull and decide that the pull they got was a bad one or can pull 
to near the group and get a tag.

Clerics have lull and root and cancel magic and DA to guarantee they get 
back to the group if the pull is a dangerous one (caster, lets say)

Monks these days have lull as well, and a 50 range pull disc they never 
run dry on, I'm still thinking that despite this and FD they aren't as 
good at pulling, on paper, as the above classes.  Reality tends to be 
different, as the people most interested in and skilled at the job tend 
to play this class.

I'd say a Berserk is a worse pulling class than any of the above, the 
only worse melee would be a warrior, with no real tools at all (well the 
throw stones thing or a bow for better range)... but even they could be 
better pullers simply because they are built to accept the MT position 
which is pretty hard for a Berserk to lose if he's pulled.

Grage, 44 Berserk, Luclin
