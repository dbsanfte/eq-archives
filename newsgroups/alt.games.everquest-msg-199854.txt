There's a page with lists of the races at:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/races.html

If you click on the links for each race name there will be a picture
of a character for that race.

Some other info, which you might already know:  

Barbarians, Ogres and Trolls are considered large races (though
Barbarians can also wear medium sized armor), Dwarves, Gnomes and
Halflings are considered small races, the other races are medium.  One
advantage for large race warriors (as well as shadow knights) is that
they don't need a shield to bash as they have the slam ability.

Also, Humans, Erudites and Barbarians are night-blind (though this
isn't as big of a problem as it used to be but still a disadvantage in
certain areas); Frogloks and Dark Elves have Ultravision (the best
vision); the other races have Infravision (in between).

Some other racial abilities/traits which are innate to some races
(although some classes eventually can train in some abilities, such as
sneak and forage):  

Dwarves start out with a sense heading skill of 50.  Halflings, Wood
Elves and Dark Elves have the hide skill; Halflings also start out
with the sneak skill.  Wood Elves and Iksar have the forage skill.
Frogloks and Iksar start out with 100 swimming skill; Frogloks also
can breathe underwater for longer periods than other races.  Vah Shir
have natural Safe Fall ability, but also consume food and drink faster
than other races.  Trolls and Iksar have regeneration, so they can
regain their HP faster than other races, but they also have a 20%
experience penalty.  Ogres can't be stunned from the front in melee
(though still can be stunned from behind and from magic).
