Disclaimer: I've never encountered this mob, so I'm entirely speaking
out of my hat on this one.  Tony's "brute force" suggestion is
probably the most foolproof, and perhaps what the designers
intended.

Aggro with a pet to eat the DT?  Perhaps also using one of the "ignore
the next X hits" spells?  (Is there a spell like this for players?)
Substitute a nearby charmed mob for the pet above?
Keep him mezzed long enough to get the loot?
Can Pacify work well enough as a ghetto-mez?
Synchronized uber-nuking to one-shot him before he can hit back? :)
Fear as ghetto-mez?
Is there anything similar to Weaponshield that would temporarily blunt
the DT?
Keep the mob stunned so it can't cast?
Bind nearby, suicide run, run back while group kites him around?
Use the 2nd veteran reward to max your resists?

Probably half of these won't work, but perhaps they will get the ball
rolling. :)
