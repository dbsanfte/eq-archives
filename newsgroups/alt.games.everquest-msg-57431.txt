Some people take "group leader" way too seriously. The fact that your
name is at the top of the list is one of game mechanics, not genuine
leadership.

If these things happen, it's fine to say, "Thank you for the clarity,
but I don't use mana." or "Thank you for the SoW, but Accelerando is
faster."

If people insist on doing things wrong (or, even, not to your taste)
get out of the group. If you're not having fun, it's time to go.
