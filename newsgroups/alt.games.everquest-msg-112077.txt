Well, I didn't think of that restriction.. heh, that cuts out Cabilis East
and Grobb. (Wolf form makes Oggok friendly).  I died in Neriak 3rd gate a
few weeks ago doing a dead drop to my DE cleric twink (need more Validus
Custodus pieces, heh).

You should be able to solo up the Seb key and the Jade prod for Charasis,
but you should take a melee friend with you for the Xalgoz camp in Kaesora,
both to chew through the hordes of light blue/greens and to loot the second
fang. (Xalgoz always drops 2 fangs, and rarely something else, half hour
spawn timer with PH's, either clear the church or just pull the one guy that
spawns in the pulpit inside.

Um... post-50 I find it better to just not pay attention to the bar...

I'm nearly 1 yellow into 52, about 1 blue from quadding wyverns (2 or 3
quads, I left CS because it was overcamped by $*#%ing monks soloing light
blues for AA), 1.5 blue from grouping in Chardok (3 hours worth) and the
rest from my newly discovered charm soloing in Mons Letalis, I've discovered
the Leech caves and it rocks.
