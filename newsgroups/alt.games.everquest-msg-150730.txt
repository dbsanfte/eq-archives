I use google to post, so I only see updates to this group every 4 or 5
hours.  So I suspect you've got several replies already.

My addition would be a small gripe about the druid AE snare vs
ensnare.  Why is it that ensnare cannot be overwritten by bonds of
tunare?  BoT only lasts a couple of minutes, while ensnare can last 9+
minutes.  Somewhat annoying.

I quad mostly with my wiz, but this past week have experienced what it
is like to quad as a druid.  Druid quads are very easy but slow and
somewhat boring; wizard quads are fast paced and exciting.  Druids can
self sow and heal any mistakes.  And with the extensive length on
ensnare, druids have the option to med kite.  Wizards don't get that
option, as you barely acquire more mana med bouncing than you spend
keeping the mobs snared.

If I had to do it all over again, and choose among those two classes
for quadding... I'd choose the wizard without hesitation.
