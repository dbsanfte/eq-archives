Thanks for the information.  You are probably right.  I will have to rethink
how
to loot my corpse.  If my son's char is not KOS he can drag it away from the
guards for me.  He's a 13 Barbarian.  Do you know if barbarians can travel
there?

I appreciate your clarification above, even if it is a bummer.  Thanks.
