Well that's a good question. Every time I've gotten tired of EQ enough to be
seriously debating dropping it (and one time I actually did cancel for a
couple months), they have rolled out a significant adjustment that addressed
my issues and hence brought me back to the game's many strengths. There are
aspects of EQ that I still consider seriously flawed, and many others feel
the same, but they can simply fix those as they have fixed so many other
things. Or add whole new flavors to EQ that don't supplant any existing
element (e.g. the LDoN concept), which I think is a very impressive thing to
pull off.

Anyway, assuming they ever finish and launch EQ2, who exactly is the _new_
set of customers that will be interested in it enough to make Sony's effort
worthwhile? That really isn't clear to me at all.

It is clear that they have gutted their support of the EQ players (I won't
bother adding my recent tech support horror story to all the others around
here), GMs are a rumor now. I assume that is simply a side effect of the
effort going into creating EQ2, and it seems quite foolish. They risk
alienating enough EQ players with poor support to make that product wither
or at least cease growing, while meanwhile rolling out a huge expensive new
product that is a sales dud because it isn't fundamentally any better than
the existing one.

Were I a Sony director or officer, I'd be having some serious concerns about
the strategic leadership decisions at the SOE division.
