Quite enlightening.  I snagged a couple of dirt cheap items in the bazaar to
add to my resists, and picked up the gems and metals for a friendly
enchanter to whip up a few items.  So, I think I will actually be going in
with resists of 100+ after all, with little work or time involved.  Now, I
have plenty of time to spend on xp instead.  I have tested fire resist vs
lava, and I know it is quite effective there, so, I had assumed it would be
equally effective on mobs AoEs.
