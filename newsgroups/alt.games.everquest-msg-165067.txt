The SRo AC is effectively random.  There are some interesting things going
on in that zone--there is definitely a cycle of rare mobs, and the AC *may*
be on that cycle, so it may help to track down whichever mob from the rare
cycle is up and kill it, and the next one, and so on.  However, the rares
seem to all wander, and get killed on their own, so if the AC is on that
rare cycle, the effect is the same as if he was just a random spawn.

Furthermore, he can spawn pretty much anywhere in the desert.

Put these two together, and what it basically means is that getting the AC
in SRo is simply a matter of doing two things:

(1) Putting in time.

(2) Not getting KS'ed.

If you only have two hours a day instead of 10, that is not a problem.  It
will just take you 5 times as many calendar days to get your AC, on average.

Try the OOT AC.  That one doesn't require a raid, but it is significantly
harder than the SRo AC.  It's a regular spawn: there is a fixed spawn point,
with a few things on the spawn table, and something spawns there 6 minutes
after you kill the current spawn.

If you think it is very little reward, don't do it.
