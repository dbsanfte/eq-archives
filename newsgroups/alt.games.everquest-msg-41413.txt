True,this line was intended to be a bit humorous.

> A level 7 blue is a puny low end warrior. 

Ok so more often lower level mobs are melee types while higher level are
casters, but I remember being a "puny low end warrior" on orc hill.
There are level 7 casters there that did not seem puny at the time. Of
course 10 levels later they are snack food.

And at level 29 you PC will be able to probably cast (more casting
classes then non), bash (well some PCs) and Dual hit (those that get
it).

I agree that killing blues at level 29 IS harder than at level 7, but
not *that* much harder.

> And let's not even get  started at high levels, 

I did put some big caveats in about high levels

An under con at any point is a nightmare. There are level 1 mobs with xK
hps. There are probably undercons at every level of the game. Some are
situational, e.g. griffin-kind are horrible hand to hand, but not *that*
bad root dotted or kited.

>if you're not paying attention. 

If you are not paying attention then *any* mob can kill you.
I was through out talking best case senario.
Being afk is not best case.

> Mobs get much harder with levels, see.

So do players. I agree that Mobs get more power-ups than players, but I
recon that I will still be soloing into my 40's and possibly beyond.
