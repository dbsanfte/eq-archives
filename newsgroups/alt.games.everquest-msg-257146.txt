Hm, damn this is a really good question.
Okay, I try to articulate my point of view. When I see a ranger I just
think of this class as a hunter. Since I really don't see a point in
hunting your prey down to slash it with knives or swords bows seem quite
natural for me. That does not imply that they can't use melee weapons
but they should prefer the ranged attack.

Do you mean Drizzt Do'Urden (sorry if I mispelled the name!)? I only
know this guy from the Baldur's Gate games. I'm not that much into
fantasy. Besides I'm pretty sure I miss your point. Is this Drizzt
supposed to be a ranger? I mean he is a dark elf after all.
