Because if it were done any other way, SOE would fuck it up just like
they did in EQ? 

Just talking single group encounters here but... 
Think of all the encounters in EQ where you needed a cleric for
healing. How many can you name where you needed a shaman or druid for
healing instead?  When you did have some where a shaman could keep the
group alive better than a cleric, they nerfed slow so it wouldn't
happen again. 

Think of all the encounters in EQ where you needed a warrior to tank,
basically any mob that required defensive. Can you name any encounters
that required a SK or paladin to tank? 

The same goes for enchanters and charm. The problem with EQ was that
when you needed a certain class to finish a (single group) enounter,
it was always the same classes.
