If others were selling them for 10pp each, why not sell them for 5pp
or so? You can do people a favor *and* make a nice profit. People
won't sell them for more than the market will bear, so at 7gp5sp each,
you were only cheating yourself. When all yours are gone, the others
will still sell theirs for much more profit.

I just can't understand some people's aversion to making money. It's
not cheating anyone if they are perfectly willing to pay your price as
opposed to making/farming the items themselves. You're fooling
yourself if you think most of those people didn't just buy you out and
mark the stuff way up for resale.

Drop me a line if you ever come across a bunch of GEBs or Centi
Longswords while in such a charitable mood. I would be thrilled to
blow your typical margin out of the water with an offer of, say, 250pp
each? After all, they're free drops, aren't they?
