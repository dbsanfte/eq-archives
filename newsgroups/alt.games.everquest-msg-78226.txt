I would try to mezz first, since it seems to me that tash is a bigger aggro
than a failed mezz. If you get aggroed use stun then backoff and rootpark
the mob or tash stun them mezz again if you can. Granted it has been awhile
since I did crowd control at that level so my advice might be kinda useless
to ya....
