My warrior companion is now nearing the ripe old age 49 seasons and has 
started to suggest that she may like some new clothes.  So I thought I'd 
see if anyone had any suggestions or thoughts ?

This is I believe how she is currently equiped

ears   - Cougar Claw Earing x 2 (Ac 4 Str 3 Dex 2)

Face   - Sarnak Hide mask (Ac 6 5 str)

Head   - Rygor Chain coif (Ac 13 Str 3 MR 3 15 mana)

Neck   - Chipped Velium Amulet (Ac 4 Str 4 30hp)

Arms   - Crafted

Wrist  - Crafted

Wrist  - Hero Bracer (Ac 9 10 str )

Finger - Plat Fire Wedding Ring (Ac 5 55hp)

Finger - Jagged Band (Ac 5 Str 3)

Hands  - Crafted

Chest  - Rubicite (Ac 19 4hp tick regen & a lovely red color)

Waist  - Fbss (I don't think theres a problem with this, although if
anyone can suggest a different slot haste item, I'm sure she'd happy to 
use the Thick banded belt she has in the bank :))

Legs   - Dark Scale Greaves (ac 14 10 str 2mr pr dr fr cr)

Feet   - Kylong Boots/Dwarven Work Boots ( Dependent on whether a 
component magic requirement)

Range  - Frost Covered Tome (3 Str 3 sta FR 15 30hp)

Primary  - Wurmslayer (Nice but a BIG stamina Drain)

Off hand - Cane Of Tranquility

I think that the main idea would be up her AC, which is around 850 ish, 
probably swapping out the rubicite, crafted and getting a decent pair of 
boots.  A new primary weapon that wasn't such a stamina drain would also 
  be fairly high on the list.


Any input would be gratefully received
