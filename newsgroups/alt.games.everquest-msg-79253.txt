Actually not so much a troll as an experiment.

This event actually occured, I however only heard the story from the person
holding the point of view as written. Trying argue against this absurd
position while in stunned amazement proved completely futile, so I decided
to put it to the test.

So far, the general consensus - the unanimous consensus in fact, seems to
support that even Druids should get a fair share of the loot in groups. This
is a good thing indeed. I cannot wait to present my findings to my roguish,
and slightly Druid envious, RL friend who will no doubt wish to refine his
position.
