No, that SUCKS!  I set up my new Athlon 1400/Geforce 2 Pro system last
night, and was planning on letting it patch up to current last night.
Of course, with the new patcher, this was not possible because even
the patch server was unavailable.

So now tonight when I get home I'll have to run the LONG patch on a
new install when I could have been playing right away.
