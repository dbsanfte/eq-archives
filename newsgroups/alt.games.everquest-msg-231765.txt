Thats not necessarily a problem....I used to play a multiplayer Virtual
Reality fantasy game in 92/93 with co,puter games at the time it wasnt
bards tale or Ultima but it was FPS dungeoneering.

Voice was there with headset mikes and they took note of your sex and
modulated the voice based on sex and species. A male voice playing a
female was ptched up a little, and vice versa. Elf voices were pitched up
and dwarf voices pitched down. You could do some silly things if you
wanted but it did fundamentally work reasonably well. THe weirdness there
was you could sometimes hear someone shout in the pod next to you and
getting that overlaying with the modulated voice did weird stuff and I
guess in EQ or MMORPGs then main/alt differences would be strange.
