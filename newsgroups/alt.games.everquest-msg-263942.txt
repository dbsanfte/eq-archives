    I think that's a shortcutted way of thinking about it. The fact is that
if you were in a pickup group with a shadowknight, you would be unable to
cope with content as tough as if you had an equally geared paladin or
warrior. And while that in itself isn't bad, the differerence is closer to
30% than 5%. A paladin and I mitigate exactly the same with identical gear,
except that he alternates between stunning the mob and healing himself,
while I er, just get the shit kicked out of me.

    So while you may not actually prefer a pally to a shadowknight, you ARE
more likely to say "ok this group sucks I'm logging" if your group's MT is
an SK.
