Yes warders are no longer 'working correctly' nor are warders, warrior class
anymore, Ie, VI removed Dbl Attk, parry, & riptose & bash. Warders now = BL
& get block. A 39th lvl pet according to VI's pet designer posts, off
another site, IIRC stated the BL warder should be about 2 x more powerful
then it is ATM, & be doing quad 40ish damage.
