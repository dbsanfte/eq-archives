Absolutely and totally untrue. I switched from my last card (GF2 Ultra 64
MB) to my Radeon(plain old 7200 64 VIVO)about a year ago, and I've never
been more pleased with any video card. I've changed drivers once in 12
months, and have not come across anything that doesn't run well, in Open GL
or D3D. My Ultra was a constant struggle- one driver for this game, another
for that, and a 3rd for general 2D use- th eOmega drivers for my Radeon do
it all, and it performs slightly better than that NVidia card did.
Take a look at the Hall of Fame over at Mad Onion, in the 3DMark 2001
section- and, if ATI cards are so bad, explain why 9 of the top 10
performers are running Radeon 8500s. Not to mention that the image quality
on the ATI boards (2D and 3D) is much better, at least IMO.
