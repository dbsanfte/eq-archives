Everquest has a sort of balance. If it gives good loot, it has bad exp and
vica versa.

Very clear example: the mushrooms in Runnyeye are better exp then the
goblins, although they're lower level. The goblins on the other hand drop
good armor and weapons for their level.


It usually is a good idea to switch between exp-hunting and loot-gathering
whenever you feel like it.
I made the mistake of going full-force levels in the beginning, which made
my mage still wear cloth at lvl 40 (feet, back and shoulders).
Considering it was a hell-level I simply left the exp-grounds, did some
quests, did some trading, farmed greenies for pp and gear I could use. After
I felt comfortable I went back to the exp-zones and got a few levels again.
