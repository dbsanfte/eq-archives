Well, yes, but if you have any desire to do end-game encounters,
levels are much, much more important.  Level affects aggro, resists,
mana pool, hps, ac, attack.  Level is the most important single stat
in the end game.

OK, while this isn't incorrect, it sure as heck is an odd way of
looking at it.  When you die, you still lose exp, and when you give
yourself that level 49 res, you only gain 90% of it back.  You do this
a couple times, and you lose your level.  Then you have to spend more
time leveling just to get back to where you were before.  Level is the
most important single stat in the end game.
You can only do general AA stuff until level 55 anyway, and other than
run speed, there is really nothing that gives any real advantage to a
cleric.  (I would go far as to say that a cleric would benefit the
least of any class with additional run speed.  Clerics don't pull,
clerics can gate, clerics are almost alwasy bound right outside any
tough dungeon, clerics have DA, etc.)  After 55 you get your archetype
skills, and if you put enough points into general and archetype, you
can finally get your class specific skills at level 59.

While this is technically correct, it's doesn't work that way in real
gameplay.  At level 51 you can hunt mobs up to 13 levels below you and
get full exp, at level 60 you can hunt mobs up to 15 levels below you.
Of course at 51 you can hunt all those mobs that con white/yellow/red,
but a cleric won't be doing that solo, and really won't be doing much
of that even in groups.  In addition, relatively, a level 60 is much
more overpowering to a level 45 mob than a level 51 is to a level 38
mob.  Finally, it take the same amount of exp to get an AA point at
level 51 as it does at level 60, but you get a LOT more exp from a
level 50 mob than you do from a level 40 mob, so it is MUCH easier to
get AA point at 60 than at 51.

None of this is any reason to not put all your points into AA, but it
is much, much easier to get your AA points once you make level 60.
