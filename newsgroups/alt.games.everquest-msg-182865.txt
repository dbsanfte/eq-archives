It took me about 2 days to figure out how to do stuff in xnews.  There's 
still some things i like a little better about OE (like the simplicity of 
its thread watching system), there's some things I like better about xnews 
(like automatically watching replies to posts I make).

About the only other thing I like better about OE is that it highlights 
unread messages that make 'em easier for me to find than with xnews.  But I 
may just be missing something about xnews.
