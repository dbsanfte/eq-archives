You've stated some design facts which are obviously true. What you
haven't done is point out how three zone morons are *not* responsible
for multiple trains in places like Karnors. In my experience, you just
find better players in Seb, with more dungeon time and better tactics.
And if your group is going south on a pull in Seb, they know to camp out
a cleric, not try to make an impossible run for the heavily guarded zone
out. Plus, it takes a *bit* (not much, but a bit) of work to get a key
and get in there, and organization with a porter to get out. KC is
unlocked and easily accissible to any moron with two friends. There are
lots of good places to pull in KC, but you still see the same ones at
entry, ledges, RCY, LCY. And if they fuck up, they'll still run
screaming for the zone every time, barreling over everyone eslse there.

No, James. I think I'm still of my original opinion. You *do* get a much
higher density of idiots in KC (and Velks, for that matter) than you
will in Sebilis or Howling Stones.
