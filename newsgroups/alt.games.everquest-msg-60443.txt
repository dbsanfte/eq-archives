I suspect that all of this is a hang over from AD&D where HP were not
calculated "live". So if you had Constitution (STA) 18 when you leveled
you got a +4 (?) bonus to your HP roll for that level (e.g. 1d8 + 6) but
if you had constitution 11 you got no bonus. If your Constitution
changed at a later point you did not loose the extra HP, so a "roll
play" party could share a +Con item to ensure that they all had as many
HP as possible. Of course and good GM would disalow this blatant
rule-mungering.

In EQ the HP gains by level are hard coded (there is no dice roll) and
the affect of STA is calculated "live", i.e. if your STA changed you HP
are recalculated. So basically this is all bogus nonsense.

HTH,

Jim
