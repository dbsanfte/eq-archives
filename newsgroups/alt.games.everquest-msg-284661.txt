well, in a group specifically designed to exploit pb-aoe spells, you 
wouldn't die before anyone else in your party =)

typical makeup is 1 cleric, 2 enchanters, 2 wizards (or less desirable but 
functional - mage/druid), 1 puller ... where the chantys chain cast their 
pb-aoe stuns and everyone else casts any pb-aoe damage ... and the crux of 
making it profitable is to have at least 15 mobs in a pull

with a talented group, there's no reason you can't have 30-40+ mobs per pull

the cleric is there to heal, obviously, because it's inevitable someone is 
going to get hit eventually, *but* the cleric's "word of <whatever>" spell 
line can contribute damage on a very efficient level
