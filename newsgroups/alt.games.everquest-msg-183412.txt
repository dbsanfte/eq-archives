Fear Kiting works in POJ (or used to) not only with the exploit but in other
circumstances as well.  I was only in one group that ever used the exploit
and it didn't work out very well because you have to stand right in the
middle of the hall to do it and you get tons of adds.  So it's not really
much of an exploit.  There is not much difference in a feared MOB that gets
stuck in the wall an one that runs back and forth in a 2ft area.
