By the time it comes out you'll probably be able to lower your level
using the mentoring system.  It wouldn't be a huge problem if you have
out-levelled the content as you have friends in the correct level
range.

If I was level 25 with my Warrior/Guardian then I wouldn't have
cancelled my pre-order.  He is level 19 and ordering it 10 levels early
is a bit much - he may not ever get there or when he does there may be
a more interesting adventure pack out.  (I know its only =A33.50 but it
would still be throwing it away if I never used it and I could always
order it later)
