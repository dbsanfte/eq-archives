Yes, it *does* still apply. If you want EverQuest to be as reliable as 
your car, then let Sony tell you what computer to buy and what software 
to put on it. Have you never seen a stop light quit working correctly? 
Have you never had a drippy faucet? Have you never had a power outage? 
Ask those unfortunate folks out east about how reliable their power and 
phone service was during the ice storms last winter. Medicine is a lot 
different in that there are lives at stake. If you want the monthly fee 
for EQ to be raised drastically, I'm sure they can make your risk of a 
bad experience similar to that of an adverse reaction to a new 
medication. Medication is not expensive because the components with which 
they are made are expensive. It is to pay for the R&D, safety testing and 
marketing that are behind them.

It's not a jaded concept at all. It is fact. People continue to complain 
- quite vehemently, in many cases - about the downtime and other 
"inconveniences" without any knowledge of what caused it in the first 
place. Don't expect them to come out and explain that Bug A was caused by 
.DLL B version 5.7.12.105 conflicting with the garbage collection methods 
implemented by operating system kernel version 2.4.32 which went 
unforseen due to the fact that...blah, blah, blah. That wouldn't satisfy 
you any moreso, and would likely do more harm than good, what with all 
the armchair programmers second-guessing them constantly.

A friend of mine, who has no real interest in computers as an instrument 
of communication, education or utility, once purchased a computer from 
Dell. Why? Because he wanted to play the many games available for the PC. 
He sold it six months later, disgusted by the small amount of effort and 
ability to follow instructions required to purchase, install and play the 
typical computer game. I suggested he stick to console games and he was 
more than happy to comply. The moral of this story? If you want a 
guarantee of the quality of your gaming experience, buy a console game. 
X-box is a nice one as well as PS2 (not a huge fan of the Gamecube, but 
is has its merits). With the complexity of the computer gaming platform 
comes some disadvantages. You have to take the bad with the good.
