I dinged to 20 in EK, and then I got to 24 on Gargoyle island in OOT. But
that was before Kunark, so there are probably better options now...

And its not just low levels that its easy to solo. Its going to take me
forever, but I should be able to hit 60 solo. Its almost necesary - the few
times I actually find a group, the xp is slower than soloing.
