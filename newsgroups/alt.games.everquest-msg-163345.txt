No.  The higher your INT/WIS/STR is (whichever is highest, the others
don't count), the faster you make skillups.

And having the highest possible chance of a skillup on each
combine is an *enormous* help, in the long run you'll save
thousands and thousands of pp on raw materials, and untold 
hours/days/weeks of gathering mob-dropped components.

In fact, except for the very lowest-levels of a tradeskill,
where components are cheap as dirt and available in unlimited
quantities on merchants, I'd say not to even bother practicing
any tradeskill until you can cap your preferred tradeskill
stat (e.g. INT/WIS/XXX: XXX = STR for Smithing, DEX for
Fletching IIRC, and some tradeskills don't have any alt stat).

I recently did some major tradeskilling (including taking
Jewelcraft from 0 to 192 in a day) with my current best-buffed
WIS of 260, and it made such a difference that I kicked myself
for wasting time/materials way back when doing tradeskills
with a WIS of a mere 150-200.

Any money you spend on gathering a "tradeskill suit" which
maximizes your tradeskill stat will be recouped in savings
on tradeskill materials and farming time.

Also, don't forget to pick up a Geerlok device for any/all
tradeskills you do.  These give you an effective skill of
+5% to the appropriate tradeskill, which can significantly
increase your success/failure ratio.  However, since you're
probably giving up a handheld item which gives you
+tradeskill stat, it's a trade-off:  Are you best off
saving money via faster skillups (which lowers the number
of raw materials you need to buy), or via more successes
(which brings in more cash on the sell-off)?  The answer
will vary depending on the component-to-sellback ratio
of whatever you're working on currently.

Head on over to eqtraders.com, and check out their
message boards.  *Tons* of useful advice and info
for every type of tradeskill.

It won't be profitable until around 200.  And it'll take
many thousand pp to get there.

Getting to 188 isn't too bad, the sell-back cost is almost
equal to the component cost, if you farm the mob-drop components
yourself.  But it gets ugly from 188-200.  For example, some
people do the Mistletoe Cutting Sickles for practice in
that range, and the component cost is roughly 300pp *per attempt*.
And while you can sell the results if you succeed, you'll
only succeed about 1 time in 20 at that skill level.  And
it'll take *dozens* of attempts on average per single-point
skillup.

Be afraid.  Be very afraid.
