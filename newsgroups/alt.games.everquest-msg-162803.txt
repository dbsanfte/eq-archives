Well, this is a problem because the spectral droprate in HoH is higher
than the ethereal drop rate anywhere else.  You dont find that stranged?
Of course you dont, since you have access to the gravy.

Whatever, I can tell right here that you and I will never see eye to eye
on this.  I am not asking for VT gear.  Just a reasonable chance to get
63/64 spells.  I should have to be in the top 2 guilds on my server to
do that?

I was talking about the drop rates of spectrals, girdles and windblades.
You know they are ridiculously common.  The spectrals are needed by 12
of 15 classes and available nowhere else at anywhere near the frequency
they drop in HoH.  The girdles are pretty badass for a common drop, and
the windblades are better than the pally sk and 2h war epic.  You cant
really think thats the way its supposed to be, can you?
