This isn't a function of a larger group, its a function of incompetant
players.  No matter how large the group, only one tank should be
bearing the brunt of the damage... some incedental damage due
to ripostes or AE spells, perhaps, but nothing that requires healing.

MT should be the person who takes the least mana to heal over the
run of the fight.  Sub 50s, this means whoever takes the least damage,
over that, due to the efficiency of CHeal, this means whoever's HP
bar drops more slowly.

Assuming good aggro control, more people means mobs dying faster
or the capablity to kill larger mobs.  With the new post 50 changes
in exp, killing larger mobs becomes an interesting alternative to
sticking with the easy fast kills.
