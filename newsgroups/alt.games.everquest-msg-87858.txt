    Since you get the weapon back if you fail, and since sharpening stones
are very cheap, I'd recommend sharpening, then spending points to "cap"
Smithing at 20... but you might be facing one issue. Tarnished versions of
the Iksar weapons also drop, and I remember at one point that Rusty iksar
weapons couldn't be sharpened. If you have regular weapons, you're golden.
If you have things like rusty shan'toks or rusty fer'eshes, though, you may
want to take one of them and just test to see if you CAN sharpen them. One
thing I will say: if you're low on cash, don't raise skill from 1 to 20 by
making metal bits. Each failure hurts. (For someone with cash this is the
method I recommend, as you need the Bits later anyways. Oh boy, do you need
the bits later....)
