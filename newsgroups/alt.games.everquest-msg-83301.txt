Because they are 1hs, primary only and backstab only works off your primary
hand, thus you can't BS with them.
Backstab is what puts Rogues at the top of the premiership when it comes to
melee damage output and that is why people want them in groups, to drop mobs
faster.
Rogue behind a mob = The kind of DoT Necro's can only dream about.

The only down side is if you can't effectively tank, not easy to BS when you
have aggro as well.
