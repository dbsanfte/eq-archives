But this story is classic CNN.

Compare CNN's coverage of any international news story with that of Reuter's
newswire.  I saw enough selective storytelling by CNN and the AP during the
wars in the former Yugoslavia to make a person sick.  As one major example,
how they apparently didn't notice the decimation of the Krajina Serbs in
Croatia by the majority Croats there, all the while publishing story after
story about the Bosnian Serbs doing the exact same thing to the muslims in
Bosnia.

Don't get me wrong, I am no apologist for the monsters who were and will yet
be punished for the terrible things done in Bosnia.  It's just that, thanks
in large part to major news organizations like CNN, many other monsters of
the Balkans will never be punished.  Franjo Tudjman and Illia Izetbegovitch
among them.  Of course, Franjo is dead and Illia is about 700 years old, so
justice will never come to them in this world.  It just wasn't part of those
news outlets' agendas.

Sorry for the OT rant, folks.  I hate CNN with a passion for the harm
they've done with their own special brand of journalism.
