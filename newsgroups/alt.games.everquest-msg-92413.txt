Our calls seem to be one of three things:
1) Idiots that call for *every* little thing ie. the show that is
suppose to be on, isn't; Cartoon Network blinked off (all other
channels are fine [CN is having broadcast issues at night it seems])
or the cable went off, for 5 seconds and they are screaming for a days
worth of credit.

2) Bill issues, to pay it, bitch about it, or scream cause they were
disconnected for non-payment and how dare we turn them off just
because they owe us 4 months of past due services.

3)Equipment issues: Can't hear the show, can't see the show, can't
program the remote (even though they have the same instructions I've
got), or don't like the color scheme on the set and want me to help
fix it.

Yep. Or preferably, when it comes to cable, just take the damn box
away from them.
