Hm... I'm about the biggest name nazi around, and I don't have too much
of a problem with meaningful names, as long as the meaning is in keeping
with the fantasy environment. What the naming convention seems to ask
for, though, is a meaningless name followed by a meaningful *surname*.
If it depended on me, I would have made the use of the name generator
mandatory, and have people at least work for twenty levels to put some
meaning into their surnames. This would probably cut back quite a bit
the frivolity.

Having said that, I get less worked up over bad names than I used to,
simply out of utter exhaustion, not because I've come to like them. I
can't remember the last time I reported somebody.
