Unfortunately, potion drinking does not rely on channeling... I found
it just as impossible to imbibe a SOW with my 200 channeling
HIE Cleric as with my dumb as a box of rox ogre warrior.  I could
successfully cast gate with its ludicrously long cast time even with
3 frost giants pounding quad hits into me at once... but take a sip
of sow?  Not if my life depended on it (and it did)

I wish it relied on alcohol tolerance, actually, they could change
the skill name to Drinking, have it work the same as channeling;
now that would be nice!
