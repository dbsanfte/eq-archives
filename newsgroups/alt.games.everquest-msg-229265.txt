I don't want to give you guys a long story to read, so I'll get to the
point.  Someone in my normal LDoN group suggested that resists on my DD
spells was tied to my charisma (I'm a magician).  I figured it was probably
more tied to the fact that I wasn't malising (sorry, just hate to do it and
will avoid it like the plague if possible).  It was not the first time this
guy has suggested that resists on *all* spells, not just ones like charms
and lulls, are tied to charisma.  All chatter in the group immediately
ceased and there was an uncomfortable silence.  I wanted to type, "WhyTF do
you keep saying that?"  Fortunately, the Pally showed up with the next mob
in short order to give us something else to focus on.  Has anyone
heard/tested/acknowledged any correlation between charisma and resists on
something like nukes or malisement?  This I know there are some people out
there who have been around the block a lot more than me, and, honestly, on
the off chance that charisma does have an effect on resists on all spells
I'm better off equipping an Opal Encrusted Stein in my secondary slot than
whatever I've got now.
