Big loss that.  A "challenge" requiring low-grade twitch play to
mitigate part of the game's anti-melee bias.  I miss it terribly.
Almost as much as I miss the idiocy of having to beg some caster
to please come to a city and bind your melee toon for a few pp so
that your CR's would be merely onerous rather than outright
punitive in comparison to said caster.

I didn't see much point in bothering with your complaint about the
bazaar, player gear farming/trading and twinking were very well
established long before Kunark, you haven't yet noticed the real
evil the bazaar did to the game.  As for your particular example
of the SSoM, mudflation had obsoleted that quest within a few
months of its introduction, the Rangers who would see the weapon
as an upgrade were much too low a level to kill the mob.  Your
general complaint about mudflation is years late, and does it
really matter what the name of the "cool stuff you can aspire to
as an untwinked lowbie" is?  For that matter, there were quite a
few items with small stats on them floating around in the old
days, it was hardly such a big deal as you make out to get a
Spiked Collar or an Errolisi Bracer or any of a number of other
items.
