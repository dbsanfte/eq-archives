With my lvl 18 Human Monk, I use the Concordance books I got from the Gypse
when I turned-in Greater Lightstones.  They have no weight, have 6 Large,
(maybe giant), slots, and if I ever go broke, I can sell these books for
9pp.
No weight reduction, so I have to watch what I loot.  If I am headed back to
sell, I will loot everything and not worry about the weight.
