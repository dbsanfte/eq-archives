I started playing a new bard a few months back, leveled him to 7, and left
him for dead.  Last week, I picked him up again and got him to 20 for the
first manasong.  I then had a friend kill me and rezz me so I could see the
song effect. I didn't notice any increase in my mana regen but I figured it
was due to it being such a low level song.  So I played some more, and hit
32 and got my second manasong.  I had a friend again kill and rezz me, and I
started playing my song.  Again, no noticeable mana increase, however, my
Paladin friend said he noticed his mana increasing at a much faster rate.
That's when I came to the horrible realization, Manasong has no effect on
the caster!!!  Not normally a problem for bards, but lately, I've come to
love charm kiting mobs and that's rough on the manapool.  Such a cursed gift
it is.
