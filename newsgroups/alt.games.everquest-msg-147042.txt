Hi everyone,

Me and my friends chat about EQ sometimes in RL and I think it is funny how
each person forms their own way of pronouncing the various names of things,
or how they refer to things in EQ.

One friend insists on refering to wepons by delay then damage, so a lammy to
him is 19 / 9 ! I asked him why would you care about delay-per-damage? What
does that measure? He insists on measuring it that way despite the
usefullness of damage-per-delay.

Names like mana take a real beating....is it "Man-uh" or "Mon-uh"?
"Free-own-uh Vee" or "Free-own-uh V-eye"?

PC names suffer too, it's funny to pronounce a player's own char name
different then they do!

Too funny.
