Agree /ignore the person how you decide to send your money and help other
people out is your business. However to clear something up about the
vendors, there are a few that do sell unlimited amounts of certain
compnents. I found this out by looking at eqtraders.com. When I was working
on my baking and needed batwing it listed a merchant who sold them, I went
to her and bought 5 bags of them, 800 batwings, and she still had more to
sell. Only thing i haven;t found being sold in unlimied quantities are bone
chips.
