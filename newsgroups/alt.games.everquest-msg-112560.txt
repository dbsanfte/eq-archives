We dressed up our MA first of all when we hit ToV, since improving him
would be most beneficial to all of us. 
(Giving preference to our main tanks and pullers worked perfectly till
the two loot handlers decided by themselves that one of them, a
cleric, also needed a full suit more than all the other plate wearers
in the guild, and chained armor to her behind everyone's back. 
They are not in our guild anymore.)
