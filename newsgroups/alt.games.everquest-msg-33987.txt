I was in a group low-mid 40's group

Shaman
Shaman
Magi
Druid
Cleric
Wizard

Continuous blue - low red single pulling (thanks to harmony).  And
twice a high level duo trained 3-4 blues-low reds on us and we still
took them all down. Even a high red named spawn they trained on
us--the druid kited it and managed to keep at the top of the hate list
while the magi's pet slowly beat it to death.
