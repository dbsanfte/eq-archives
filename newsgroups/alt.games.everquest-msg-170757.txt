You're basic experience is accurate, though not entirely so.

Up to about 15, the old world is really the best place to hunt for anyone
other than a Va Shir IMHO. 15-25 is Paludal in Luclin - no doubt about it
(this has killed the Oasis BTW). The xp so kicks tail that you level up, and
then worry about things when you get to 25. From there, a lot of folks stay
on the moon with Marus Seru or Netherbain, followed by DSP. The basement in
High Keep is still VERY MUCH camped though in that 25-33ish range, and the
xp is great. The faction hits are also worthwhile. You are almost certain to
find a group in HHK around 25 or so, but you need to be prepared to be on a
waiting list. Paludal is often the same way, BTW, though it has more camps
and is therefore not as bad.

In the 30's, you'll find people camping around Paw and Rath Mountains in the
old world plus SolB in the later 30's. Other popular places are OOT/FM in
Kunark and Dawnshroud on Luclin. Once you're in the 40's SolB is about the
only old world place I still see groups forming, and they are few and far
between (odd since that is still a GREAT xp and loot zone).
