Or another spooky idea, learning how to control aggro while you're still 
at a level where a mistake doesn't end up with you getting quad-hit for 
700 points of damage (ahhh, I love ya, Vindi).

At level 32, that means waiting a few seconds for the tank to build 
aggro before attacking, don't snare the mob immediately when it runs 
into camp, don't cast DOTs and nukes early in the fight.

I used fast weapons all through the 30s, 40s and 50s, settling on a 
Defiance and a Centi LS until I got my epics, and never had aggro issues 
*unless* the tank was horribly incompetent or poorly equipped, in which 
case I usually told the group I'd tank instead.  Up until the mid-40s 
you're really not slowing the group down by having a ranger tank, and we 
hold aggro better than any class, save perhaps a shadowknight.

Hope that helps.
