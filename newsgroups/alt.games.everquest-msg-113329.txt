Hehe, we already got one thats a little like it:

Glowing Black Sword
Dmg 9
Dly 20
Dex 20
Proc: Neutralize magic
Proc at level 45


This little gem are a GREAT beginner sword, nice dmg/delay (ok, at least 
it was when my troll was a baby running around in SRo), but after level 
45 its only good for soloing bards, or in VERY special situations.
The proc remove YOUR buffs, so can probably be good if youre soloing 
some caster, and need to remove some dots, but if youre grouped its 
worthless.
