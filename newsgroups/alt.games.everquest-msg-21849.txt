I've seen Gorenaire up close a few times.  In fact, she's almost stepped on
me twice as she charged back and forth incinerating Druids in Wolf form
near Karnor's Castle.  Fortunately, she's indifferent to me.  On the plus
side, the fact that she didn't kill me went a long way towards helping me
find a group that night.  (Magicians aren't well liked in Dreadlands on my
server.  Apparently one or two have insisted on having pets at all costs. 
Gorenaire hates elementals.  And Skeletons.  And wolves.  And just about
any other pet or illusion, actually.)  For the record, she appears to be on
Ring of Scale faction, which you can improve by hunting in Mistmoore. 
However, each kill in Mistmoore only appears to add one or two points of
faction, so even with a strong enough group to lay waste to the castle
repeatedly, you will have to hunt there for weeks to see any real change in
your Kunark dragon faction.  And of course, the Wurms in Skyfire are
servants of the Ring of Scale, so if you hunt them you'll lose a lot more
faction than you've gained.

I've also gotten Raptors as pets, playing with Summon Monster I in
Timmorous Deep.  Of course, as pets they show up about two feet tall.  I'm
told the real thing is much, much larger.
