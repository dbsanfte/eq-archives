I think you've missed the point here.
This doesn't need a week. Clearly the game as it is now is going to seem 
more fun after a week. It needs 5 years. And to last 5 years the game 
needs to feel much more like a real world with all that implies, and 
less like unreal online where you gather in a chat room (PoK), and then 
select which dungeon you want to go to (ports) and then at the end look 
at your score (loot & xp), with no lasting consequences of the adventure 
(XP free deaths, no corpse recovery).

Of course in a week long trial it's going to be more fun, but it the 
fact that you are in a big world that makes the game fun to come back to 
for 5 years.
