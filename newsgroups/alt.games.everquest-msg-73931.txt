Heh, IIRC, DAoC still doesn't have horses.

Given the weeping and gnashing of teeth when Verant does a patch, I really
doubt they want to deal with the troubleshooting of doing a complete
re-write at this time.  Then we would have to deal with the "growing pains"
of the post-beta release and all the downtime and odd bugs that occur.
Verant has spent alot of time smoothing the current engine and environment,
if they did a re-write, it would make the hiccup of SOL look like a smooth
transition.  Nope, I'll be happy with the current engine and actually being
able to play.

What, the greed of wanting to keep their customers?  Or the greed of not
wanting EQ servers to be down for extended patching and troubleshooting?
You have an odd business model.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
