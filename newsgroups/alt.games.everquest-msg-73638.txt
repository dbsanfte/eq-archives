I think you are missing a primary fact here bizz, you seem to have your
head up your ass today.  Look at what you just said.  You can be forced
to play a game, one you don't want to play because you don't like it. 
Maybe in the reality you exist in this makes sense, but this is a world
we all share, not bizworld.

So in bizworld we are all gonna play the games as you want them to be,
all of them, even the ones you aren't playing, just in case you might
want to play?  Anyone thinking of creating a game needs to clear it with
you first to see that you approve, on the chance that you might want to
play it some day?  I can only assume from the stupidity in your posting
today that you starting drinking early or are still at it from last
night.  Your series of posts on telling people to be open minded and
think just like you had me wondering but this post confirms the fact
that you are spewing big time today.  In conclusion let me just say,
bite me.
