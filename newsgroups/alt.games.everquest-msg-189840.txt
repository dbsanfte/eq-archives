Giving Taunt a 100% success rate may be overpowered... but it's very close
to what Paladins & SKs can already do with spells.

Being the "best tank" requires three things: the ability to absorb damage
(HP); the ability to mitigate or avoid damage; and the ability to take aggro
and hold it. The first two control how much damage the warrior can absorb
themselves, the third controls the ability to stop other people from taking
damage.

If a tank can't hold aggro, they're not a tank. They can have twenty
thousand hitpoints and it won't matter because the "meat shield" isn't
shielding. Which is why Paladins and SKs are these days preferred for the
typical PoP exp group.

You don't need a defensive discipline. You can root or snare the MOB then
back off. The warrior can't. The only thing keeping him/her alive
is his/her HP and damage mitigation/avoidance capabilities. Given the
average POP or Luclin MOB, a warrior *cannot* solo it. A shadowknight
*may* be able to solo it by fear kiting; a paladin can at least heal
themselves somewhat, and can stun, blind or root to run away if needed.

Paladins and SKs need to be viable as tanks, but so do warriors. They
gave up everything else to be the best tank, and that is *all* they're
good at, and they are no longer the best at it.
