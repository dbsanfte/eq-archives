Frankly, I'd prefer to leave the twisting of your views entirely up
to you.  :-p  But I am willing to agree with you that much of the
disagreement was revolving around misunderstanding, as I was trying
to show in a left-handed fashion.

That is close enough to truth to prevent me from identifying with
any of the political parties on the left.  It is pronounced enough
that conservatives have taken to emphasizing the libertarian aspects
of their beliefs and agendas as a distinguishing characteristic.
Doesn't make me a conservative though, I find too many of their
leaders despicable.  So I wander through the political landscape
searching (often fruitlessly, I'll admit) for liberal leaders who
are worth a damn.

Political flip-flops never seem to be exact.  But I can see your point
and can't bring myself to try and argue against it.  I just hope that
the "left" doesn't have to take too many more on the chin before they
notice that they're being incredibly clueless on some very important
topics, quite a few of their alleged leaders already seem to be punch
drunk.
