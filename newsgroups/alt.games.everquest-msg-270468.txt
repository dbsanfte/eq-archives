Odd...I've never seen development and QA within IT.  The IT departments in
all the places I've seen have basically run the servers, managed the
network, managed the phones, configured desktop machines, and stuff like
that.  

All the places I've seen, though, have been computer companies, either
making software or hardware (or both).  I could see at a non-computer
company having IT handle any internal application development that is
needed.
