That's exactly the point though. The loot coming off these mobs WASN'T
the best gear. The post-first-nerf BP off Seru was INFERIOR to the
current 'best warrior BP in the game' which was off the comparatively
super-gimp Vindi in Kael. Even in it's current state, it's not a
reasonable drop from a mob that requires the effort that Seru does -
give it back the +dodge mod and you have a BP to be proud of, worthy of
the encounter. The multi-class boots from Seru were originally a slight
upgrade for monk alone, assuming they hadn't picked up the rare boots
from exping in CT, and were inferior to KT boots to those who could wear
them. A lot of the Ssra ubers only had 1 or 2 loots on their table that
made them worth killing for and praying you got something that didn't
rot.

In fact, a lot of the 'best in slot' items come from single group
timesink camps in the new CT. I've got 7k+ buffed HPs and am wearing CT
single-group-camp items in FOUR slots - ear, ear, belt, legs. There's
are several belts I could get off ubers for 15hps more. The earrings are
better than Vulak, and to get 35/25 more hps means Seru, or an insanely
rare drop from a raid that usually drops twink junk 9/10 times. Legs are
best hps I've seen (maybe Cursed has better now), and sell for 15k on
Zeb as they're farmed so much. I really should be surpassing what I can
attain with 60 skilled people, with what I can get in a single group.

Folks 'want' the best gear, but the 'toughest mobs' don't always drop
the 'best stuff'. Take Ring of Valor's recent massive achievement of
completing the inner Acrylia ring war sequences. The key quest alone is
an obscene timesink. Then they had to fight through a series of ring
wars to down the final boss for the first time (by a long way) on any
server. And what did they get for all this work? Insultingly crappy loot
that wouldn't be worn by ANYONE present.

The result of this is, that unless the loot is massively upgraded, no-
one else will push their guild to complete this, because it doesn't
progress them 'as a guild' in any way. An area containing LOTS of
content remains totally wasted. RoV complain about the loot, loot gets
uopgraded to a more reasonable level, and suddenly, other people think
it's worthwhile, so the content gets used. 

If you look beyond the surface 'arrogance' or perceived immaturity or
FoH and other elite guilds, and look at the underlying reasons behind
their complaints, you'll often find yourself agreeing with them.
