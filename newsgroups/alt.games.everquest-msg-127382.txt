Aye, I didn't really notice it until I started dual boxing.  My characters 
are frequently invisible after either the character seeing or being seen 
has zoned or logged in, until they actually move.  And sometimes lag makes 
it happen too.  It can be a good sign you're about to go LD, and I have 
this wacky idea that if I see that and run into a zone really quick, it 
stops me from LDing sometimes.  But sometimes I just LD in the zone, or 
turn out to have LDed right where I first disappeared, or who knows. :)
