We'd killed the majority of the dungeon and at least 2 out of 4 nameds by
the time we lost.  It took us another 10-15 minutes to make our lesser
adventure because the drops were very poor.  I seriously doubt my not
letting him pull cost us anything, especially when I'm pretty adept at
pulling 1-2 at a time myself, even without lull.  If anything cost it, it
was going after the nameds, which was a group decision that he was all for.

Anyone who's so pissy about a win that they're going to have that big a fit
should say up front they're in it for the win.  They didn't; we agreed up
front we were in it for XP *first,* then nameds and the win.  We did very
well in that regard.  If a win was that important to him, he should've
spoken up or noted that the nameds weren't going anywhere until the dungeon
closed.  There was certainly ample time and opportunity.
