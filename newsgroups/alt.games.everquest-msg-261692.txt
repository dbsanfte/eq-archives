I see what you are saying; I don't think that applies in general; but 
yeah, I agree there is a class of casual players that plateau for very 
long periods of time, especially if they are blocked from advancing by 
raid flags/raiding.

All I can say is that if the item is your level or lower, and you looted 
it, I would prefer to design a system that essentially allowed you keep 
it in perpetuity for minimal effort.

Someone suggested making it degrade each time you passed it on. Perhaps, 
a better solution would be for it to be no-decay for the person who 
loots it, but that flag is removed if he trades it.

If its your item, it lasts as long as you need it; but once you hand it 
down it starts falling apart...

thoughts?
