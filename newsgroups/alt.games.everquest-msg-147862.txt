DA is not invis.  It doesn't kill aggro or prevent aggro.  It Does ditch aggro,
putting you down to the bottom of the list.. but still on the list.

DA is particularly useful for eating HTs, in fact, I've many times put DA on
(well DB really) and deliberately trained the UP zone line in ME, since that
way I can strip all the HTs off the mobs there, so we can deal with them
as regular mobs for a while.

Its possible that DA somehow doesn't aggro when you have it on
when you zone in, I can't think of a time when I've tried that... but
I doubt it.
