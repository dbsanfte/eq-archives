Hello,
I just purchased the game and am totally lost.  I have never been a game
player and the tutorial I downloaded seems useless.  I am disappointed in
the Tech support from EverQuest.
I need help, I mean basic help just to get started and be able to move
around for more than 10 seconds without getting killed.
It would be great if someone from the West Palm Beach, Florida area was able
to come over or someone might want to fly in from somewhere. lol to help me
get started correctly.
Thanks to all who can help
