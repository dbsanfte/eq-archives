Thanks to everyone for their suggestions. I went the necro route and
even got a rezz for my troubles at EW zone.
I was not currently in a guild, simply because the last 3
I was in all disbanded, and I was soured on the whole idea.

This time in Kael I had a guide, who took me through to WL , helped me
get my tooth and took me to the tower to get my spells.

I may put a lvl 1 warrior Rallos Zek worshiper there anyway, just
simply to learn the zone so i dont get lost anymore. :P

Cheers everyone.

lvl 39 druid <not so lost anymore>
