These strike me as the most damning lines... However.  I must admit it is 
possible to read them in light of exploiting a feature, as opposed to a 
bug.  "Hmm.  They're changing this feature, I hear.  I dunno why they're 
changing it, but this is my last chance to use it."  I just wish I'd had 
advance warning that they were going to change the recent large sewing kit 
feature!  

It seems to me that they possibly should have realized that the fact 
Verant was changing it meant it was a bug, in this case.  But I can also 
see where they might not have made that connection.  Further, they may not 
have been absolutely certain that the rumor they heard was accurate, but 
were going to act on the basis that it might be.

Yes.  But this guy, reportedly, didn't even go on the raid and was not, 
therefore, suspended or banned.  Nice to be able to make jokes that doom 
others from relative safety, isn't it?
