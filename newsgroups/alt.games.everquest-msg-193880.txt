Well, since you're nit-picking...
The explicit portion of your assertion is 100% correct.  OTOH,
the contradiction of my statement you imply by starting out with
"Actually, ..." is 100% incorrect.  When you open a PC vendor in
the Bazaar you examine the stats on his/her items via alt+left or
right+hold, just as you do with NPC vendors and your inventory.

While we're on the topic of examining item stats, it has been
remarked that when you right-click an item in the bazaar search
window it always shows max charges.  I'm curious as to whether
you get the correct charge count when you alt+left or right+hold
on items in a vendor's list (PC or NPC) (I know you get the
correct count in the trade window).
