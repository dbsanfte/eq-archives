It just occurred to me that it seems like buying/selling platinum is an
excellent way to launder money. Whilst I have no evidence that Yantis has
mob connections, I'm sure sooner or later they'll figure out how to use
MMORGS for that purpose and if he's not involved, then he'll either be made
to be, or else.

After all, when there's money involved, and the police are unable to adapt
(computer criminals run rings around cops most of the time), then how long
will it be till organised crime gets wind of it and someone, as happened
with the nigerian scams, is murdered?
