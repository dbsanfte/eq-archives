Quite simply, 3 warriors, with a selection of the best taunt weapons
around (Mana whips, Jaelens, SoDs, Epic) were consistently unable to get
the mobs hitting them. These aren't noob warriors, but warriors who are
routinely relied upon by large raids on the toughest mobs in the game. 

Halfway through a fight, a druid casts a single target regen, and gets
raped for example. Sitting for any mana-user is an instant death
sentence. No discernible prox agro, no discernible proc agro, no
discernible taunt agro. Best MT seemed to be a ranger, licking and
snaring like a mofo. Best MT in that zone would prolly be an SK, but we
all know they're pretty much extinct at high levels these days
