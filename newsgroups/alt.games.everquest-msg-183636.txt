Ok Ive got two very similar machines.  Well, one is the wifes, sooo...
We have two very similar machines.  On my machine anyone who has
tinted their armor has thier skin tinted as well. All the way up to
the neck line.  But on my wifes machine, the same people have very
Awesome looking tint. Example is the Wood Elf Druid with a leather
chest piece...  Tinte Purple.  On my screen the Pretty little lady
looks like a big grape with a normal head sticking out.    On my
wifes, the armor is tinted.. and you can still see the lovely skin (oh
yes and breasts).  

My machine
Win 2k
P3- 550
640mb RAM
Ninvida Geforce 2
pci 128 sound card.

Wife's machine
Win 2k
P3- 550
512mb RAM
Ninvida Geforce 2 (exact same video card)
SB 16 sound card.

Ok, Both machines have the same version of video drivers downloaded
from Nvidia,(the most recent ... 4.1 something?),  Both are running
direct X 9.  Both have ALL expansions enabled and working.
Both have Luclin models on.

I used the /dopropertinting on and off command.(of course zoning
between commands)
I have done a Full patch file check.
I have attempted to delete my eqclient ini file to see if that would
clear it up.  No go.

at present I am compairing my eqclient.ini file with hers, but am not
seeing where the diffrence is.

Please, please please.... if you have any suggestions thow em this
way.

Your time and response are appreciated.
