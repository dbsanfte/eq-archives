lol, I know...I didn't really take it seriously.  Mine was in jest as well.
I had checked EQDruids.com already, but was looking for new ideas.

 It just cracks me up because I see people use that response alot when
someone asks for advice, they get the standard "look it up yourself you lazy
so and so".

Well, yes, a person could google it until they're blue in the face.  But I
know that I for one would give more credit to a suggestion from a member of
a newsgroup that I've read for several years than I would give to some
random poster to a website or other forum.
