Poing Blank Area of Effect.

Spell line (and song line) that damage all mobs within a (usually quite 
small) radius of the caster.

Normal AE spells hit a target and all mobs within a radius of that 
target... only the "all" part is limited to 3 (total four including the 
target himself) or in rare cases 4( total 5) mobs.

PB AE spells, on the other hand, will literally hit -every- mob in that 
radius, I've personally hit over 60 mobs, and have heard people doing 80 
although its hard to imagine being able to pack them in that closely, 
perhaps they were doing goblins or something small.

Bards have a PBAE DOT, which you get at level 2 or so; apparantly its 
possible to run a swarm of mobs into a circle and make passes close 
enough to them to hit them with the DOT while not letting them hit you, 
and so kill large number of mobs without taking any damage.

A more usual approach is to get one or more enchanters, who have a PB AE 
stun line, bring lots of mobs to them while they keep all stunned, then 
use PB AE spells to mow them all down while they stand around doing nothing.

In either case, the key elements are: 1) don't let the mobs touch you. 
Nobody can stand 70 mobs beating on them all at once, not even green 
mobs, not even for a single round.  2) PB AE spells let you hit ALL the 
mobs.  So while you may find it a waste of mana to kill 4 mobs with this 
approach (the spells are usually not all that mana efficient on any 
given mob), its well worth it to spend twice the mana you would killing 
one mob in order to kill 70 mobs (thats a 35 to 1 ratio!)

For a bard, the advantage is again that you are killing lots more mobs 
than you could doing them one at a time via chanting or swarm kiting, 
even though any single mob would die much more quickly via one of those 
methods.  You do have to balance that against frequent deaths though. 
Normal PB AE groups usually include a cleric, both for spot heals when 
one or two mobs manage to resist stuns and get a few licks in, but also 
to rez the group when it wipes, a not infrequent occurance.  Might be 
worth it as a bard, especially when learning, to bring a cleric along to 
soak up half your exp but rez you from the inevitable deaths while learning!
