Wow. My friend is quitting EQ, and he is a member of our resident 
uberguild. 

He has offered me the sweet hand-me-down lovin'.

Him: "Well how about I give you the money I've got in the bank?"
Me: "Cool! How much do you have?" (insert my expectation of 15k or so)
Him: "Last I checked I think it was around 600k."
Me: (THUD.)

Upgrades galore, here I come!

'You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it 
kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
