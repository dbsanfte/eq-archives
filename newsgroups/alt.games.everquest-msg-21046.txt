    The one thing the X Summoned line have going for them is the ability to
chain-cast them. With Retribution, you have to wait for the refresh. I
imagine you STILL do more damage over time chain-casting Retribution vs. X
Summoned, but it is a consideration. It's obscene how much damage a cleric
can output with nukes vs. undead at higher levels, though (X Undead also has
no refresh time beyond base). As for fighting a lot of summoned mobs, try
the mad XP of The Hole.
