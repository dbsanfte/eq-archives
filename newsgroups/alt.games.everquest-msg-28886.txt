I don't personally use the program, but was wondering how exactly the people
at Verant would actually know a player was using a program that displays
extra information on the screen?  Would the extra app use more bandwidth
than normal?  Or do Verant's servers actually scan for that sort of program?
Or do they work primarily on an honour-system, where the player is morally
bound to uphold their end of the agreement despite there being no way for
Verant to monitor it?
