My lvl 12 Druid was killed in Innithule Swamp. I was so surprised when A
brawny kobold jumped me and did me in so fast I wasn't able to do a /loc.
My characters corpse is under water and I don't know where.  I had just
upgraded her equipment too.  What is the proper ettiquette for asking for
assistance from a bard or necro to find my corpse?  Is it best to ask in
Plane of Knowledge as people ther will be able to port with me to
Grobb/Innithule?
