As long as you plan to use the computer for EITHER home OR business but NOT
both you should be ok purchasing a DELL.  About two years ago I needed to
buy a new system and I called them to find out if one of the systems
advertised had a USB port.  Because I was using the computer for both
business and home use each department told me they could not help me.  Yes,
thats right, they would not even answer a question about the system until I
could decide if it was going to be for home or business use.  The fact that
I was using it for both purposes was just WAY to confusing to the poor sales
reps.  I finally told someone "Look it doesn't really matter, it's the
system advertised right here, does it have a USB port??" and they hung up on
me.

Hmmmmm I wonder what would happen if I had a really tough question.
