  Woops, I accidentally replied as an email instead of to the group.

  Is the quest gone because the Karanas have been cleansed?  I'm not
really clear on exactly what that means (something to do with those
tainted/corrupted mobs that appeared a while back?) but I play on
Firiona Vie where basically none of the "historic" events have
happened yet.  Is there a chance therefore that I might be able to do
this quest afterall?
