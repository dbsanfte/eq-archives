Root refers to several lines of movement "de-buffs" I know its not a
debuff, but it basically locks the mob down.  Each line has slightly
different effects, which vary from spell to spell.  Cleric/Wiz/Pal root
doesn't have a damage component, don't know about shaman/SK,
Druid/Ranger root has a DD component, that in the past had a tendancy to
break it before it took.
