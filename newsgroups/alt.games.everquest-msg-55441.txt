That's odd...  What were you fighting at the time?

I have heard that poisons can be resisted, but after several levels of using
various poisons in the NRo and Oasis zones I've never seen it happen.

Some of those low level poisons do substantial damage, as well.  Do a nice
backstab, hit with asp poison (80dd!), and follow with your first round of
dual wield/double attack and you've got a decent opening move.  I've had
some tough opponents down to 50% before they took their second swing.
