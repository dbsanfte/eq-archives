Off hand isn't dictated solely by delay, but delay is still
important.

Your dual weild skill does have an effect, but that doesn't
change based on delay.

Lets say you have a dual weild skill that works 50% of the time.

If you have a weapon that potentially swings every 3 seconds, it
will swing exactly that fast in your primary hand, but only an
average of every 6 seconds in your off hand (half the time it
won't swing when it could, the other half it will)

Now take a weapon that swings every 2 seconds instead.  In your
primary hand it swings every 2 seconds, in your off hand, an
average of every 4 seconds (half the time it doesn't swing when
it could)

Improving the speed from 3 to 2 means a jump to 2/3rds the speed
in primary hand, but also 6 to 4 is the same 2/3rds proportion in
your off hand.

What you have to consider about off hand weapons, though, is that
you don't get your damage bonus with them.  This means that the
damage to delay ratio is much more important on them, not less
important; in your primary hand delay alone may be the most
important factor, because the damage bonus at your level is so
high that swinging a 5/20 weapon may be a lot more damage per
minute than a 10/30 weapon.  In off hand, the 10/30 weapon will
be more damage because there's no bonus to take into account.

Another consideration is proc; if you have a weapon you want to
see procs from, its better to put it in the primary hand, because
it will swing more often there; you won't have to worry about the
dual weild checks.

But at your level you should be passing most dual weild checks
anyway, that 50% figure I suggested probably isn't accurate at
all.
