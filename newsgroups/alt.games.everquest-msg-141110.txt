If I worked for Verant...

Link a compass to the new sense heading compass.  that way you could have the
compass in your inventory and not have to click/hold down the button to see
which direction to go.

Make people chage their stupid names.  Lately I've seen tons of names that make
me just want to /em smack a person (yes I  know it bugs me and i should get
over it but still...if i research names for half an hour other people should
too lol)

And the big one that'll probablly get my flamed...lol...
Let a spell caster of any level scribe spells of any level.  Example: Let's say
by luck (or twinking heh) a level 5 caster gets a level 40 (or whatever) spell.
said person has to keep the spell in his inventory till said level. (taking up
a full slot)  now if he could scribe it, it would free up that slot.  Have the
spell harder to scribe obviously ( since it's a harder spell to use it takes
longer to write it like a level 1 person scribing a level 60 spell then it
takes the person 60 times longer to scribe it).  And obviously the person can't
use the spell in any way shape or form.
So...what do you think...
