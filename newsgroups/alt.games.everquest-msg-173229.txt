I think that's one of many differences.  Why in hell does everybody
insist that there must be a single reason (or in David's case an
utterly dominant reason, boils down to the same damned illogic with
a prettier face) for this sort of stupid shit to happen.

He didn't try to equate them.  He compared them to one another, in
a fairly limited way, just as you did.  You both raise relevant
issues: economics is a big deal, international politics is a big
deal, not only that but all the details of both impact aspects of
the other.  Saddam's diplomatic weakness makes him an easier target.
North Korea's history of intransigence actually makes them a more
attractive target for diplomatic solutions, they don't have the
history of "accomodating" diplomacy by covering up "bad behavior"
with lies and other deceptions (not that they haven't done it, but
unlike Iraq it has not been a staple of their foreign policy).
