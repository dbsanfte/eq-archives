You purchased and continue to subscribe to a service where the primary
testing is done by volunteer end users. If you are complaining that
there are not enough volunteers and you are not one of them, you need
to shut the fuck up.

Simple rule of any organization that uses unpaid volunteers: never
criticize the volunteers for not doing enough.
