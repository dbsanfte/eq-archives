Actually, on Sunday, I mostly ignored the chat, I was having a total blast.
Our resident human blacksmith has made it his personal epic quest to get to
250.  He is currently at 215.  In our effort to support him, we had to kill
many many Seafury Cyclops who drop Mugs of Seafoam.  I got to be the puller.
It was probably the most fun I've had in quite some time.  I was there for 3
to 4 hours, pulling those puppies nonstop.  In all, we managed about 13
hours of camping them, and netted 230 or so Mugs of Seafoam, between our
kills, and purchasing anyone elses drops.  He will be needing many more mugs
though, so I suspect repeat visits are upcoming.  They were all light blue
to me, and I still managed to get about 3 blues out of it, not to mention
400 or so pp for my split.
