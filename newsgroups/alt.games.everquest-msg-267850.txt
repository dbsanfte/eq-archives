I've yet to make apristine backpack - I've come very, very close,
though...

I've been given some recipe book by my guildmates that allow me to
make Waxed LEather backpacks - unfortunately, I need the book that
tells me how to make Waxed Hide plate first.  Soon, I hope, as I'm
dying to try it out.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
