   This for those of you who might want to get in on a beta test and take a
quick break from EQ, up to though... =)



Everyone,

  The time has come: The beta test will start this Saturday, 7-28-2001 at
3:00PM EST. We've programmed in a little surprise contest just for the
beta. Details about this contest, the background story for the beta, and
technical information can be found on our web site at
http://www.ataleinthedesert.com/beta.html.
  You'll receive another email on Saturday, a few hours before the test,
giving a URL to the client software.
  We're doing a final alpha test tonight, 7-26-2001, beginning now, 11:00PM
EST, and ending at 12:30. Download the alpha client from
http://www.pair.com/egenesis/atitd.exe.
  This letter is going out to around 600 people. Given that not everyone
will log in at once, we can still take a few more for the beta. If there
are game sites that you frequent, feel free to send them a copy of this
email, with permission to post a notice in their news section inviting
their visitors to join.

On the banks of the Nile,
Teppy
