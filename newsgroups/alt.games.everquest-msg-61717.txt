>>>Is that including NO DROP<<<

according to the transfer rules, if you switch servers, you show up NEKKID.
Nothing on you, nothing in the bank, nothing period.

The only things you have are your skills, and your scribed spells if you are
a caster.

If you stay on the same server, and just switch accounts (which I believe is
what the original poster wants to do), you keep all your stuff.

This rule was made so you couldn't load up rare items from an older server,
then move to a newer server and make an extreme profit.
