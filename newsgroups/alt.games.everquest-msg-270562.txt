I was reading an EQ2 forum, and someone had an interesting complaint.  
The server that they have all four of the characters on was one of the 
last ones to come back up, so they decided to make a new character on 
one of the other servers.  However, they could not delete a character to 
make room, because you cannot delete a character on a server that is not 
up.  Oops!
