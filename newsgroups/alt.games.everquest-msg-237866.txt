That was my game plan, yes.  I was teased and flirted with, and I responded.
I flirted and teased her and she responded.  And over the course of several
months, it was all quite innocent.  But yes, it was my fault I allowed it to
become anything more than innocent, but it was also her fault for not
cutting it off on her end.  When it became apparent to us that there was a
developing attraction which was getting out of hand given the strange nature
of the relationship and the cirumstances surrounding it, and that I should
get away due to my feelings, she mailed me this, "...I dont know what to
make of this whole thing, and I'm trying real hard not to form an attachment
to you but you are sticky.   So rinse yourself off and don't leave me inside
that game alone :-)"

So, stupidly, I didn't abandon her, though I know I should have.  I have no
idea why I didn't just forget about her.  Was that a gentleman?  It's all
grey to me.  Things always used to be black and white to me, but this
experience has left much grey.

In real life, I would never get involved with a woman I knew was married.
Online, anonymous and separated by distance, I had no problem with it, until
much later when I began to feel guilt and disgust after I got to know her
husband through grouping and casual chat.  The guy was actually decent, and
I wasn't any longer.
