I try to purchase LDON using the Digital Download and when I click the Buy 
button I get a screen saying it's not available for Ubisoft customers.  Then 
it gives me several email addresses to send messages to and they are all in 
Europe.  I am in the US and my credit card company is in the US.  Any ideas 
how to fix this error?  Trying to reach Sony is impossible.
