   I took Firiona to work, stuck velcro on her feet, then stuck her to
the top of my monitor at work.  It's a flat screen, and there isn't
anything else on it, so she really stands out.  One of my friends was
looking at her, so I told her that I play a high elf too, except that my
hair was gray.  She nodded knowingly, and asked if I dress like her when
I play.  I said yes, of course I did.  Then I offered to show her my
metal panties.  I think a couple of my coworkers are now thinking that I
might be bi.
