Your machine is fine.  My wife plays with a 450 on a Voodoo2 with Luclin
installed and while it's not the best, she plays just fine with it.

Sounds more like you have line noise.  Modems will correct for line noise,
but it takes time for them to do it.  The noiser your line is, the more your
modem with have to correct bad data and the slower your connection will
seem.

Get your lines tested.  Your telco should be happy to come out and test your
lines.  Just tell them you are dialing up to the internet and you've changed
modems several times and you still can't get a clean connection.  Tell them
you think it may be line noise and would like them to test the lines.

They may want you to have your house lines tested first, so you may have to
pay someone to come and check out all your house lines.  Even with repair,
that's likely to be a pretty cheap visit.  Usually the line noise is at the
terminals.  Water on the exposed lines, loose or corroded wires, or exposed
wires usually happen out by the terminal box where it's easy to fix.  Wires
running through the walls (much more expensive fix) tend to stay healthy a
long time and it's not likely where the problem is.

If that doesn't clean things up, you have to get your telco to come and
check the lines outside your house/property.  It's very common for those
lines to be many decades old and exposed to the elements or buried in moist
ground with the shielding corroded away.  No one but the telco can come and
fix that up.
