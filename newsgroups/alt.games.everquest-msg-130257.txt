Best all-around PvP class is SK, especially true when they get the 55
HT disc. Bards are pretty hard to kill, but they also take a while to
kill anyone.

Still, I'd give the same advice to you as to someone on a blue server:
pick the class you like. All classes can contribute in PvP, so if
you're working as a team, work as a team.
