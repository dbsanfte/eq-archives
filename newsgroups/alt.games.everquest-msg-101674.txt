Well, this is going back to when removing hair there wasn't the socially 
acceptable thing to do.

Merkin was originally a term for the female genitals, it seems to have 
evolved into a term for a pubic wig around the time wig wearing became 
prevalent amongst the well-to-do (when you would shave your hair to avoid 
lice, and wear wigs instead), and more recently has come to mean a complete 
artificial vagina (dodgy sex-shop toys etc) rather than just the hair. The 
pubic wig is making a comeback as a fashion accessory these days though - 
you can get them in all sorts of bizarre colours and styles now.


The author of http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_232.html got these 
responses regarding the use of merkins:

    * They used to shave off all the pubic hair as a cure for syphillis, so 
the well-to-do used wigs.

    * Before penicillin was around to ease the lives of the promiscuous, 
these were used to cover up any sores prostitutes may have obtained in the 
line of duty.

    * They used to treat the syphilitic with mercury, which caused 
baldness.

    * The merkin is for women with no pubic hair. Some people just don't 
develop hair down there, and this can be embarrassing.

    * In days of old a common problem was lice. One of the ways people 
dealt with this was to shave all the hair off their bodies, including arms, 
legs, and pubes. Wigs became very popular. Pubic wigs caught on slowly, 
starting among the kinkier set, but eventually became halfway respectable.

    * A merkin is a crotch wig for both men and women and is usually worn 
on the outside. Have you ever seen a Scot in full regalia? That little fur 
"purse" in front is a merkin.
(note: this one is bollocks quite frankly - that's a sporran, not a merkin)

    * In a country of mainly dark haired people, a prostitute may wear a 
blond merkin to be unusual and therefore more desirable. (Got this from a 
dictionary of sex.)

    * One of the more recent uses is to allow exotic dancers to comply with 
local laws prohibiting full nudity. They wear what amounts to a flesh-
colored panty with hair on the front, appearing to the patrons of the 
establishment to disrobe completely without actually doing so.

    * In a sci fi story by John Varley called something like "The Barbie 
Murders," a group of women gives up individuality (and sex) and undergoes 
surgery to become perfect nonsexual beings resembling Barbie dolls. This 
involves losing genitals, pubic hair, etc. One Barbie goes back to being a 
woman for a night, painting on nipples and using a merkin.
