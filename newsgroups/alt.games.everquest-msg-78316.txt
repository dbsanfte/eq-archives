Ouch.  Though I really don't notice much difference between 140 and 200,
*97* CHA is just plain too low.  Are you working to get OTHER stats up
instead of this very important one?  Work to get it to at least 120 after
buff, ASAP.

Crude Stein (15)
Oppaline Earrings (5x2)
Drakehide leggings (5)

These are all lower-end CHA items but at level 55 I still have it with me at
all times (don't always use it but I keep it).  Back when Oggok was a place
high levels went to get xp killing guards (inner guards, not newbie) they
used to be plentiful but Oggok doesn't seem camped much anymore.  If you
have higher level friends (40+) get a group together to kill a few guards.
I don't know retail.

The earrings...guessing about 30p each
The leggings...guessing about 75p
