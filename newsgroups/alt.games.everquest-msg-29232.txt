It's just like anything in life, there will always be people who go too far.

That's there own fault though isn't it, so who cares. I am yet to have
someone put a gun to my head, and make me play EQ until I can stay awake no
longer, ....it's a conscious decision, and when or if I do that, there is
only me to blame.

Someone who lets EQ spoil there life, cause divorce, loss of job
etc.....Well if it wasn't EQ, it would be something else, it's just an
addictive personality thing.
