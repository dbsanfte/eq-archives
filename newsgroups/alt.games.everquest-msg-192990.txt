Not that I condone it, but I can pretty much tell from your comment that 
you have probably never been in a guild on the cutting edge that had to 
learn all about a new zone without any guides or strategies, etc.

When a high level spends TONS of plat, time, effort, experience and deaths 
to determine a method to defeat a particular zone/encounter they rightly 
feel cheated when the waves of people follow them with almost no effort by 
simply gimping off of their hard work.

If you want the rewards, be prepared to take all the risks.
