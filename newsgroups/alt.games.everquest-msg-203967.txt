ok, so maybe they are few and far between, but there are those who the
game   *is* role-playing.....  Just because most people don't doesn't
mean we don't exist. 

Role play if you want to and let others do their thing..... I've found
that if I role play then people either respond to me that way or they
don't and they leave me alone...... kind of like real life.
