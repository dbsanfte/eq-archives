Nope, tribunal was one of the first severs after the orginals in fact
I believe it came after the first 2 race war servers even. I think it
was roughly 6 months after the orginal servers like Solusek ro,
karana, etc were up. The creation date of my druid I play is four
hours after tribunal was up and I think april of that year while the
first servers were in october or november? So yeah, I think it puts it
at 5 or 6 months.

The Najena_alt rubicte was a revolving 4 day event on about every
server with an altered najena (even said Najena_alt upon zoning in)
The rubicite in it though was somewhat nerfed though with about the
same stats as fine steel I think, like the original bracer was 10 ac
and I think the najena alt rubicite bracer is 9 ac. I will have to
check since a char of mine has the bracer. Even if the BP dropped
there (can't remember) it was no longer a regen BP.

Basically I think it was an event to get some colored armor out there
right before fine steel and dying it was put in, sort of a reminder of
what colored armor was like. 2 resin sarchopyga dye is the same color
as rubicte and in fact people use it to fill up a set.
