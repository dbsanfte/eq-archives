My enchanter's pet just attacked the Druid once again (has happened 3
times now).  Druid was in wolf form at the time (not sure if that
makes a difference).   I'm sure this must be happening to other
people.  If you stand next to an enc pet.. watch out!    Lucky, I was
able to gate the Druid before the pet killed him.  I tried to
following your advice, but I'm not sure how the /bug command works.
It brings up a widow, but I can't type anything in the window.
