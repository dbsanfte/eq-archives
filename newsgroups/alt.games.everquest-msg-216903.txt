Others have already discussed that vendors sell different durations of 
meals, but a couple other notes:

1) Vendors DO sell stat foods.  Check the female vendor upstairs in the 
bazaar, she has some +1 WIS food or something.

2) Force feeding stuff makes it only last half as long, so forcing muffins 
and milk means they only last about 7.5 mins each.
