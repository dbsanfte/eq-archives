: A mage's pet is like its tanking partner.  A necro's pet is just something
: extra for them.  Mage is like a wizard without the root spell.  Which
means
: can't kite.   While a necro doesnt' really need a pet because it can fear
: kite with or without its pet, with one it just makes killing mobs alot
: faster.

One major downer with having a mage is that the pet dies when you zone (or
go invis). It is really important that you are safe when you enter a zone,
because you don't have the pet as shield. I prefer being invis when I zone -
just in case something ugly is standing on the other side.
