As an enchanter of 55 levels I must say on the subject of druids in
dungeons...

Come on in, the water's fine.

Honestly, you lose very little in dungeons. Wolfform. Sow. Harmony. An AE or
two iirc.

But what you bring to the table: Damage Shields, Snare (As a charmer and
mezzer I love snare. I do not particularly like your root, which breaks mez,
but learn how to work with me with it and we'll get along spendid. Ranger
Tanks take note, damage roots make good mez breaks, generate good agro.),
good dots that can be cast on a rooted target, good healing and buffing, the
get out of dungeon free card (ports/evacs), and nukes.
