Kocho warned us more than a month ago that the site's days were numbered.
Keep looking at the forums, there are a couple other sites out there coming
up. Kocho will probably change the main page to be links to the others

Basically, no tiff. Kocho largely hasn't played in close to two years. It
was just time for her to move on.
