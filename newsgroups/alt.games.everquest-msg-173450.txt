And if you go to SK, might like to pop into splitpaw. The usual camps if you
dont want to go in deep are close to the zone out. Better loot and xp as is
usually the case with dungeons.

Bit of a run to a bank though. think there is a merchant in SK so can sell
up and swap your coppers/silver to pp, you lose money like this but just
means you can carrz on hunting and for longer.
