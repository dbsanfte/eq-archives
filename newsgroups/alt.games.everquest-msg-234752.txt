First, I assert that plat isn't IP. 

Everquest is. If someone uses everquest to profit that isn't
inherently a violation of the ip holders rights.

A copyright is specifically limited to rights with respect to
copying/broadcasting/transmitting/exhibiting etc. They do not grant
rights over all aspects of its use.

If the ip holder wishes additional rights he can have his licensee
sign an a license agreement. (the EULA). Enforcing the EULA has
nothing to do with copyright.

I  dispute that "plat" is intellectual property in the first place.
And thus copyright has no bearing on the issue.
