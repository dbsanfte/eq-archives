Ok in the order asked:  It means someone is looking at the items you are
wearing.  They often do this by accident if they are using Mouselook (EQ
can be set to use the Right mouse button to look around.  Clicking on
something with the right button will also examine it.  For NPCs, you just
get the normal Consider message, merchants will open their inventory so you
can buy things, and on Player Characters, you can take a look at the armor
and weapons they carry.)  If you are wearing something obvious like a robe
or a weapon, they may do it because it's something they've never seen
before.  Many people will ask first though, since a few people feel that
examining someone without permission is equivalent to accosting a stranger
and going through all his pockets to see what he has.  Other than the
annoyance factor, it can't do any harm and they can't steal anything.  (Of
course, on Rallos Zek they may see something worth killing you for.) 
Mostly it's an accident, sometimes it's just someone checking you out to
see if you have anything interesting.  Sometimes bored high level
characters will examine newbies, and reward the one with the most pathetic
gear for their level by giving them a treat.  (Don't count on it though.) 
And sometimes greedy low level characters will examine people and then
ask/demand to be given anything and everything on that character, because
they deserve it.  (Of course they deserve it.  Didn't you know that they
are the center of the known universe?  You didn't?  You must be stupid
then, because it's certainly obvious to them.  :)
