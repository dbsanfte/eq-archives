Oh the white folks hate the black folks,
And the black folks hate the white folks.
To hate all but the right folks
Is an old established rule.

Like almost all fantasy games, the environment in EQ is midieval.  In
the Middle Ages, you *did* fear / hate the strangers from far away.
Most people nowadays really don't understand the vast world of
difference between a midieval society and ours.  A society where a
farmer can only create enough food in a year for 4 to 5 people, and
half of that food may be destroyed by vermin.  A society which is just
a *very* short distance away from starvation, and that distance is
kept there by hard, continuous, unremitting work.  Strangers who show
up want food, and food is something you never have in great supply.
You need enough for you to live on, you need enough to pay your lord,
and you need enough for planting in the spring.

What's worse, some of those "people" (trolls and ogres) view me as
*food*!  How am I supposed to make friends with someone who's likely
sizing me up for a sandwich?  Others (dark elves) view torture and
murder as art forms, and keep on looking at me like I'm a candidate
for an art exhibit.  And you expect me to be friends with them?
You're nuts.

I believe it was Isaac Asimov who once pointed out that the emotion
that has most helped us achieve dominance over most other species on
this planet is hate.  Not love, not friendship, not anything nice;
hate's the one that put us where we are.

The deer doesn't hate the wolf.  The wolf comes along and tries to eat
the fawn; the deer fights as long as there's a chance, but when the
fawn's dead, the deer runs away and forgets about it; there'll be
another fawn next spring.

The wolf kills a human child, and we don't go out into the woods
looking for that specific wolf, and ignoring all the other wolves; no,
we kill every wolf we come across until we feel a bit better (or at
least tired and want to go home).  It wasn't the deer that wiped out
every wolf and bear in Europe; it was humans.  And we did it by hating
the wolves and bears that hunted us.



Oh the Protestants hate the Catholics,
And the Catholics hate the Protestants.
The Hindus hate the Muslims,
And everybody hates the Jews.

My God is right.  Obviously he's right, else I wouldn't be following
him.  You don't follow my God, so you must be wrong.  And people who
are wrong are dangerous to have around.  They might have queer ideas,
they might have unhealthy practices, and if they piss off my God (just
by being here, for example), then I might get caught in the gears when
my God punishes them for not following him.

In EQ we live in a world where the Gods are real, they walk the world,
and they can personally lay a whuppin' on anybody who disagrees with
them.  The Gods don't all get along; I can't imagine Rodcet Nife and
Bertoxxulous sitting down to tea together, can you?  I follow Rodcet,
you follow Bertoxx.  If I help you, then I might give Rodcet the idea
that maybe I don't believe in his teachings as ardently as maybe I
should.  It's a lot safer, all things considered, if I were to hammer
on you a bit, and thereby show that I'm 4-square for Rodcet, instead
of maybe suddenly finding myself catching a lightning bolt or three.



I play on a non-RP server.  I follow a lot of personal rules that slow
my advance to a crawl as it is (Level 39 after 2 1/2 years of play,
totally unable to get my own class armour, and until a recent quest
was added, impossible to get my own Epic weapon).  If I were to also
refuse to group with Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, Iksar, Necros, Shadow
Knights, Bertoxx followers..., I'd never be able to find a group
again, and I might as well give up the idea of ever seeing Level 45.

There are NO in-game benefits to playing one's class correctly, but
MAN are there penalties for doing so.
