Got mine that way a few months ago.  Woke up early one morning,
feeling pretty sick.  Decided to log on and 'distract' myself.  

Drat. 

Servers were locked.  

Oh Wait!  5 minutes later servers are up.  Yay me.

Log on and see a RL friend (and Guild Leader) is just popping on as
well.  He says, "Let's go get that Testament for you."  I say
(cleverly enough), "huh?"   
He explains what it is and we race over there.  Beat the other guys
there be at least 30 seconds.  I rooted and wrathed and attempted to
hit the little bugger until he finall died.  Then spent a LOT of money
in Qeynos before I got the right cards...   One happy young cleric
that day.

The morale of the story:  Get up early on patch days.
:-)
