    The ring is AC 0 AGI 9 HP 80 and has Spell Haste II on it. People who
don't usually tank, like monks, rogues, and rangers, like it for the extra
HPs over Velium Fire. And what'll really get them excited is the XP down
there. The respawn on the imps is something like half that of the rest of
Sol B, around 15 minutes. You'll never want for pulls.

    The camp has a lot of stuff. There's a named on the level just below the
camp. If that area is uncamped, and it frequently is because of a lack of
things to pull, the named there drops the mask I mentioned and Crystal
Chitin Gauntlets. The nameds in the US camp drop SCHW, Silver Chitin
Wristband, Crystalline Spider Fang, Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood, the
ring I mentioned, and the Crystal Chitin Shield. All seethrough-model
spiders can drop small pieces, small bricks, large bricks, and blocks of
velium, and Crushed gems for the Velious armour quests. The crystal-model
Hunters have random rare drops, including Crystal Chitin Boots and Arms.

    Tiara is live side, I believe in the fort. Might be a bit of a jog.

    Then congrats on your new ring! ;-)
