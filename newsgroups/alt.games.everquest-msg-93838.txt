Velk's Village is one of the few spots where I enjoy pickup groups.  I 
know enough people that I can usually fashion a pretty good group, and if 
I'm leading the group, I generally do my best to build what I consider a 
power-group.  Basically, tank, cleric, me, melee damagex3.   About 1/3 the 
time I'm the tank though, which means I'm tanking, hasting, slowing, 
pulling, manaing, and doing crowd-control, so we're a bit less than 
perfectly balanced.

Well, I have yet to figure out how to split them, my damn feign death song 
is broken.  With a guild group, and a real tank, I can mez the 3 extras, 
and we can do them pretty easily.  Hell, with a monk/sk/necro we can pull 
them one or two at a time, and then they're easy.  If I'm in a pickup 
group with no feign-puller, I just leave 'em up.  From the comments I get 
when I pull the first 2, the average pick-up group doesn't even know they 
exist.  
Hell, my little 4-man guild group was waiting 6 minutes for the repop, but 
with shaman healer I didn't want to risk the bad pull.

Yeah, the same guild is crowing about clearing VP last night.  Ummm, 
sorry, killing Phara Dar two days after we killed the other 5 isn't 
clearing it.  Gimps.
