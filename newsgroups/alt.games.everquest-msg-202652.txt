A few *dozen* letters?  ROFL. I'll bet the CEO of Sony gets more than a few
dozen pieces of JUNK MAIL a day. A few dozen letters will cause them to
reverse the change.  ROFLMAO!!

Thank you for the laugh.  I needed that today.

ps, if you think that a few dozen letters and a handfull of whining brats
quitting because of a change to a spell that was NEVER INTENDED to work like
it did on lowbies, then you sir need to pull your head from your ass.  And
just because you "work in the business world" doesn't mean you know jack
shit about business.  you could be a mail room clerk in a bank for all we
know.

the change is a welcome one.
