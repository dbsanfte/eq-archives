Damn! I keep forgetting about that, but Slappy is correct. That's a
*great* way to do transfers if you park both characters in front of the
loom, forge, or whatever you pick.  There are any number of them in out
of the way places, particularly in some of the less used starter cities,
not near banks or the zone-in, where there's hardly ever a soul to be
found.
