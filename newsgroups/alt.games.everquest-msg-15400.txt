*shrug* I know enough about you to paraphrase what you JUST SAID.

"Hey, Verant is too stupid to code, so WHY ISN'T IT OK if I cheat?  I mean,
it's not like cheating is a BAD thing, asshole.  I mean, asshole, that if
they didn't want cheaters they would write code where cheaters couldn't
cheat, asshole, so that GIVES ME THE RIGHT to cheat, right asshole?  And
hey, just because I SAY it's ok to cheat, asshole, doesn't mean I'm, like,
actually cheating, asshole, right?  Of course, if I CAN find a way to cheat,
asshole, I'm going to DO it, but that's ok, because it's VERANT'S fault that
I don't think cheating is a bad thing, right asshole?  Oh yeah, asshole,
you're sooooooooo immature because I can swear and you can't, asshole."

That about right?

But yeah, ok, continue to blame others for your moral and ethical
shortcomings.  It's ok, it's the American Way.  It's ok to cheat, just as
long as you can blame someone else for it, right?
