Ok, I read this last night, and all of the responses. *If* this story
went down precisely as told, then I feel bad for ya, what with Phinny
being such a PITA to get the robe and all.  But glad you got some
satisfaction.

But why to I say "If"? The second paragraph above. Lots of people have
asked to see log files, and obviously it's your business whether you
want to or not. But something(s) here just don't sit right. Perhaps you
(or anyone in this august forum) can clear up more of my many
misconceptions and set me straight.

First, as others have mentioned, the speed that you got a GM to not only
respond, but arrive, for one of a million KS or Train complaints a day
is simply amazing. But...... that *can* happen if the petition queue is
empty, GM just logging in, etc. so, ok.

Second, the terms of the punishment for the offenders. Now, correct me
if I'm wrong, but I've always heard of punishments being warnings for
minor shit, and then suspensions for major stuff. And the suspensions
always tended to be three days or one week. I have *never* fucking heard
of a three month ban. For something that aggregious they would just
cancel the account instead, I would think.

Last, the fact that the GM actually *TOLD* you these specifics strikes
me as completely wrong. Obviously you had to be dealing with an actual
GM immediately, because a guide can't suspend or cancel accounts, only
bump it up. And the policy among GM's, as handed down from VI, is that
they do *NOT* comment on the details of punishments, investigations,
etc.  They simply say that "the matter is being/has been dealt with." 
And possibly that "you shouldn't have any more problems now" but nothing
more specific than that. (Anyone wondering about that policy can refer
back to the infamous <Conquest> incident and Brad's comments online
afterwards about VI commenting on the results of investigations,
punishments, etc.)

You've always struck me as a pretty up front, straight up, ok guy, Mark.
But if it were somebody else/new with less cred in this n.g. I'd be
calling "bullshit" on this story. It just smells wrong from a variety of
angles. 

Do you, in fact, still have the log? (I see several folks have asked
now.) I mean, even if you wanted to delete the peoples' names and the
guild name (for whatever reason I can't guess, because who would want to
protect the identity of players like that?) it would be interesting to
see the text of the chat with the GM, and particularly the GM's in-game
name.
