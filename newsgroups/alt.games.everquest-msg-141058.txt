    Ooh, targetless ranting! *grabs popcorn*

    Here's how our Ragefire list differs from yours. One of the
responsibilities of the clerics on the list that are within two of the
active cleric is to help camp and kill Ragefire. So when Ragefire pops on
our server, there aren't guilds watching and waiting to gank if some time
limit passes. Rather, there's a ton of people in Skyfire within seconds
taking down Ragefire for whoever is the active cleric. This was put to the
test recently, as a complete ass of a cleric that could not have got his
heart any other way was active cleric - but people still came to his aid.
(To give you an idea of how much of an ass this guy is, he used to loot
people's corpses after they gave him consent back in the old days as payment
for ressing them. Without telling them he was doing this.)

    Judgement call. If the cleric had six manaburn-capable friends port in
within a minute, he's fully recovered. Does he have such friends? I don't
know. I don't think you'd know, either. First key to avoiding bad
situations: never have part of your reasoning be "they could NOT have done
X", because it's a statement you cannot prove.

    This is correct. If Ragefire's dragon form goes for a certain time
without aggro, it depops. It is another reason our list is structured the
way it is - a Ragefire depop doesn't help clear the tremendous backlog of
clerics after the epic.
