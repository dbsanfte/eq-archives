This post is not meant to stir up a flame war regarding the new xp changes
with grouping, but merely something I was thinking about recently.  I will
say that I enjoy grouping a great deal, but have to solo a lot of times due
to time constraints and also because with my BL, is the first time I've
really had a class I enjoy soloing with.  Anyway, on to my point.

SOE has said many times that they encourage grouping to the point of saying
that this is in fact a MMORPG, implying the idea that it seems odd to play
such a game and solo.  I've had this thought about the game myself most of
the time, but the second part of that acronym got me thinking.

If this is indeed an RPG (and yes I know, few people playing actually role
play) what if the role you choose to play is a person who goes off to fight
alone and then return to town where everyone is to relax, get supplies and
socialize?  The wandering wayfarer who sets off alone to face the world,
etc.

Just seems that SOE is so focused on the massive multiplayer aspect of the
game that they forget the role playing aspect.

Again, not meant to start an argument, just merely an observation.

I now return you to your regularly scheduled posting, news, rumors, trolls,
flamewars, and information seeking.
