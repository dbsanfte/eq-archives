That's rather fucked up. If you got the zone files, (which obviously you
did) then soemthing else critical is missing if you're seeing giants and
such as naked bald humans. Hrmmm... did you run the thorough file check
afterward?  I ask because I just finished reloading EQ myself after
reformatting my hard drive on Friday/Saturday. Fortunately I have all
the CD's, but I still ran the thorough file check after the initial
patch from hell.

Failing all that I suppose you could e-mail some kind soul on this
newsgroup and ask them to mail you the CD to install. ;-)

But it doesn't sound like it should come to that.
