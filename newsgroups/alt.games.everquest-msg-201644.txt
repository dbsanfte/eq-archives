I checked on EqTraders about charisma. The cutoffs are lower than I
remembered. Here is the main paragraph (There is more good information about
vendor pricing there; it's well worth reading):

As far as vendor prices are concerned, factions can be broken up into three
categories. Dubious or worse, apprehensive, and indifferent or better. If
your faction with the merchant is dubious or worse, of course, the merchant
simply won't sell to you (I have something here that %Rs use..let me
see...it's the EXIT, now get LOST!), or will even try to kill you on sight.
If you're at apprehensive, the merchant will sell to you, but is going to
charge you an arm and a leg unless you can get your charisma WAY up there.
Lastly, any faction indifferent or better will get exactly the same prices
for the same charisma. Doesn't matter if you're ally or sneaking so as
indifferent as can be, it's all the same to the merchants.
There are several crucial charisma numbers to shoot for. Key to this is
that, whether your faction is apprehensive or indifferent or better, there's
a stretch from 61 or 62 to 76 or 77 (I haven't been able to get a gear
combination that gives any of my characters either 61 or 76 charisma yet,
unfortunately) that gives exactly the same prices. So, if you can get your
charisma up to 62, don't bother getting any more charisma boosters until you
can get enough to get you to 76. However, when you do get to 76, the prices
will suddenly drop by about 6%, instead of the 0.5% you get for most
individual points of charisma.
Better known is the "magic number" of charisma, 104. This is the point at
which indifferent or better merchants will give you the best price they're
ever going to give you. This price seems to be based on 1.05 times a "actual
value" that you will never see used, but is only directly known by the
server. For instance, many gem and metal prices are clearly based on this. A
nd, if you notice the prices at which the vendor will buy such things back
from you, although it looks like a very irregular number, for instance 95pp
2gp 3sp 8cp for a bar of platinum or a sapphire, that just happens to be
100pp divided by 1.05.
The last and highest number to shoot for is 132. This is the charisma at
which you can normally get the cheapest prices even with apprehensive
faction.
