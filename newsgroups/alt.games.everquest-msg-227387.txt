In this case, the target of my complaint is on that class of 'career 
players' who sold duped plat for cash. No amount of 'retribution' to 
their account will affect their bank accounts beyond requiring them to 
pickup a new account and spend a few days getting back to a level where 
they can earn enough plat for sell it again. These people don't give a 
crap about 'guilds' reputation, items, quests, freinds, etc... so 
banning their account is minimal punishment.

To address the rest of your question though:

In general I *do* object to game-external transactions. It fundamentally 
violates the 'rules of the game' and is cheating by any reasonable 
definition. Imagine a game of Scrabble where for $5.00 you could buy 
whatever letters you wanted instead of working within the pool, a game 
of monopoly where boardwalk could be bought for $10.00 even if you don't 
land on it, or a game of chess where losing your knight can be rectified 
for $2.00, or a game of D&D where a difficult encounter can be smoothed 
over by slipping the GM a couple fivers to grant the party 2 levels on 
the spot.

While I acknowledge that there is a certain level of 'ownership' to game 
assets, and that their is definately a market for them. No game except 
for Poker or Magic the Gathering and the like is intended to be 
manipulated with real world cash (and even MtG has numerous tournement 
types where your cash flow is virtually irrelevant)

Part of the precept for nearly every game is true equality, that 
everyone starts out as a flat broke level 1. The fact that you have a 
Ferrari in your garage shouldn't affect your Chess Ranking, your 
Scrabble score, or your EQ character.
