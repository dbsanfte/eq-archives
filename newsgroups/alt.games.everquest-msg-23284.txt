You have to take into account general ignorance. To many, sadly most,
people the "internet" is a single entity, and if you can access the
"internet" then it should all work equally well, all being the single
entity. So, If you can log in and get your homepage, by that sad
logic, then any other problems are the fault of it's owner. In this
case, EQ MUST be broken because he can get on the internet fine. 

Trust me, I deal with such people day in and day out. Want an eye
opener to the depth of human stupidity, work tech support. Ignorance
can be tolerated, but supposed knowledge based on conclusions drawn in
that ignorance is stupidity. 
The urban legend of the college student that wanted the IT department
to put the internet on a floppy so she could work from home is very
likely to have a basis in truth....
