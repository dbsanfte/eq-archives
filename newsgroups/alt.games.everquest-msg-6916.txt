There are many proposed solutions to the various PvP problems.  The one I
used to advocate would be to create a PvP server and just do away with
looting.... period.  You can't loot another player after you kill him...
period.

When I would post such a suggestion I would usually get responses like "no
way  u suck dude."  or "why have pk with no phat lewt"

These are exactly the kind of people that a no loot PvP server would get rid
of.  What would be the point of PvP with no loot?  Indeed, the very thing
that attracted me to PvP in the first place.  Role playing.  It's not
something that should happen often.  But if yon Paladin offends your
agnostic sensibilities with his religious rhetoric, by all means, smite him.

Another idea would be to allow a person to loot only what he is willing to
risk.  In other words if you allow others to loot your coin on your loss,
then you can loot the coin of others, worn items, bagged items, two items,
three items, everything.  It could all be up to you.  When two players
engage and one kills the other, the least leanient looting rules opted by
the two players applies.  So if I set my loot options to coin only, and you
set yours to coin and bagged items, and you kill me then you can loot my
coin since it is the thing that we both had at risk.  It could also be
possible to make a player only able to loot as much coin as he had on him.
So if we both have coin loot on and I kill you, I have 30 plat on me, but
you have 400 plat on you, I could only loot 30 of it since that is all I had
at risk.

Best Regards
