    They might have eliminated silly little things, like time to re-assist
and delay to break a mez. You also free up more mana for ENC nukes, and DoTs
can run full duration. That might not be significant, but it'll be
something.

    It's surprisingly bad considering the stats on it. That mana pres is
only on buffs, not including HoTs. For clerics, that's not a lot of spells
cast over the course of a raid, what with MGB. It also locks you out of
other necks, since you can't really just toss aside VT loot yet. I can think
of at least two Mana Preservation IV necks that Monual's guild could get,
and that would be much, MUCH better for him. Not counting other dream necks
like Aten. So it may look awesome, and it does have awesome stats, but it
hurts your focus development as a cleric. I'd much rather see that thing go
to a SHM.

    It's a balancing act, as you well know. Were I a loot officer I'd cringe
at giving Aten's neck to a pure melee class, as losing the 8 mana regen is
terrible, no matter what your merit. Other people looking at it would say
that you have the right to determine what is best for you, and we should
only look at merit to figure out how to award stuff. And for the record: I
regard the Aten neck as a hybrid neck, SK first if all other factors are
equal. Yeah, SK loot - who knew?
