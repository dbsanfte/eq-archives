Ummm, that's an unusual make up since with the 1200hps lifetap, I'm
not sure you're gonna generate enough damage output with just four
warriors, 1 rogue, 1 wizard and 1 ranger.

Usually, the group make up tends to be wizard and enchanter heavy with
just a couple of tanks to hold VS's aggro while all the wizards burn
him down.  The enchanters are generally busy chain casting Rune on the
tanks.

Are you sure you're not thinking of VS Remain instead?  They are very
different mobs.
