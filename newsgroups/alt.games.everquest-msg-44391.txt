Actually the CEO of Sony Online Entertainment (actually the quoted name is
wrong, it is Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc, at least now, according to
www.sony.com) and the CEO of Sony Corporation (the parent of Sony America inc.
which is in turn the parent of the gaming company) are two entirely different
people who live and work in to completely different countries which are
practically on the opposite ends of the planet.
