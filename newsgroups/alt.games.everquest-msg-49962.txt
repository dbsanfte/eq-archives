One thing you can do fairly easily to get money at your level is to
kill lots of bears and hope you can find some high quality bear skins.
Depending on your server you can usually sell those for about 30-50pp
each.  Also, kill LOTS of skeletons and sell the bone chips to higher
level necros who will pay 2-5 pp per stack.

Eventually you will get high enough in level to move into areas where
you can get better loot.  In your upper 20s consider getting into a
group to kill treants in South Karana.  They drop lots of plat and
some staffs you can sell to merchants for decent money.  However, I
have heard the SK treants have been changed since I was in my 20's so
they might be harder now.

Keep your eyes open for someone selling a Flowing Black Robe.  They
are fairly cheap and look decent on a necro.
