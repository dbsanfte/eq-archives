This suggestion went over like a lead balloon.

He said "I just think  this is the best server".

Hmm, the ONLY server with the dreaded Trivial Loot Code.  The
only server (except perhaps one of the zeks?) without a common
language.  Whats there to like?  He doesn't even know Teapray,
which is the principle reason I'm there!  And then there's the 
roleplay friendly environment, which I enjoy in small doses...
but apparantly is anathema to this particular barbie!

Oh, and there's the fact that there's very little by way of "no
drop" stuff.  So perhaps he's the beneficiary of some
outrageously good twinking that nobody on any other server could
hope for... probably by virtue of buying pp on EBay.  Thats the
only benefit I can think of for such a player.

For me, a great benefit is the fact that people like him tend to
avoid the FV server... how he slipped by the filters I don't
know.

Splendid One, 38 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
Plus its named after that hot milk elf in bondage herself
