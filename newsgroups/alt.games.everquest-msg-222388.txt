I have a level 61 warrior and was thinking of what I should use in my 
off hand. In my main I have a wind-worn longsword ( 12/18 if I remember 
correctly ). Now if I am correct in my thinking, which my wife will 
gladly tell you I usually am not, off hand isn't dictated by the weapons 
delay but by skill level. If this is true then I would think I would 
want a high damage weapon in off hand...any suggestions. I have a 
defenders lightblade ( 22 damage weapon ) in off hand now , or should I 
just buy a fast weapon...If my thinking is wrong.

Thanks !
