As  magician I used the pet tactic to locate him, stand at the ramp and tell
your pet to guard here, it will point to the nearest enemy, the at considers
the spawn point to be a npc, he will be your pointer to the location, go in the
direction he faces a couple steps, tell it to follow, the guard again, repeat
until you get a spawn.  Have sow or scale of the wolf and if you get the
message that you have been ambushed run immediately to the kael zone.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the
mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
