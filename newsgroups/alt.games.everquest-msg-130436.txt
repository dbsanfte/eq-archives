What, that I find the existance of such groups to be offensive?  Or that I
would go to the company and ask them to remove them?  Gee, sorry that I feel
it's my right to petition a company for the redress of grievances.  If they
choose, they can remove the groups, if they choose not to, I can choose to
remove myself.  Those are the rights I am given.  It's not a matter of
"freedom of speech."  It's a matter of the fact that I have no desire to be
a part of a group that would include such racism.  The fact that you think
that's so wrong is what is truely sad.
