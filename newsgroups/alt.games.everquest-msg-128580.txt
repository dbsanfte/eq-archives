People often ask for around 2k for these, stating that it "No longer drops"
don't buy into it. It does no longer drop but as said above it IS only 6%
and the FBSS is more than 3 times that at only double the cost, or less.

If you want a cheap haste item, sporalli gloves have 9% haste (from Mold
Master in Runny Eye)
Lesser Guard of haste also has 6% + AC7 +3str/dex/agil (bit of a bitch to
get but sells for 2k and less)
Greater Variant of the above is 11% ac10 and +5 to stats but give how hard
it can be to get Aero to pop in the first place I'd not bother looking for
one, sell for 5k.
