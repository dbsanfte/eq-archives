Being a cleric, I was able to use mine last night and was playing as a
65 Gargoyle. That monsters class is Berserker, however, he comes with
no weapon and you cant equip one either.... He is, on the up side,
maxed out in hand to hand. He was like a monk more then a zerker. 

He did have an interesting bug though. He has an AA skill that is
levitate. When I click on it, it wont cast but tells me that I dont
have enough mana LOL. Since zerkers dont have mana, I think this is
going to be a useless skill.

Oh, to the OP, I got mine in EB Games yesterday. There were about 5
left on the shelf.
