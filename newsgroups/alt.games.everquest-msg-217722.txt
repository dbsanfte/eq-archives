You can certainly make that trip, I've made it quite a number of times
with several characters.  But invis is highly recommended.  If you don't
have invis you're better off going through the Frontier Mountains.  In
fact, given that you're already hanging out in OT, I'd recommend the FM
route.  With SoW it isn't too hard to avoid the mobs going thru FM, and
the FM giants see through invis anyway.  Levitate makes the trip even
easier.  I've done it with none of the three (SoW/Invis/Lev), but it
takes a fair bit longer as you have to move a lot more cautiously.
