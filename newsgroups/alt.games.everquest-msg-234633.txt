Yup.  That's what makes it difficult--SOE doesn't object to giving plat or
items if you do it for the "right" reasons.  Right reasons include:

    1. You are friends with the other person.

    2. You have no connection with the other person, but are being generous.

    3. You are role-playing, and it is something your character would do.

    4. The other person does something for you in-game, such as gives you
    in-game items or currency.

    5. You think the other person is a girl in RL, and hope she will go out
    with you in RL if you twink her character.

However, this is a wrong reason:

    1. The person gives you money in RL.

I suspect they are happy to just ban people they catch, and not have to
argue this thing in court.  So far, as far as I know, there has only been
one case (when some currency/item sellers sued Mythic for banning them from
DAoC), which came out on the side of the MMORPG companies.  That's all they
need, so why sue someone and risk having a decision go the other way?
