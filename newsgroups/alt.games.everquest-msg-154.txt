I am a level 14 wizard and have been playing with groups that I could shout
up pretty effectively.  My characters name is Yibumuen and i have been
playing for a bit off and on.

I have been grouped with bad players, and good players.  On the whole, 80%
of the people that I have randomly grouped with know what they are doing.
the other 20% are just totally clueless.  I think my favorite was a cleric
that we grouped with.  He kept pulling MOBs to us, even when we were down on
health and several of us were posting OOMs to the group.  When asked why he
pulled, he simply explained "I don't know".  Then, when we asked him to
start healing, he promptly started healing himself...  He was kicked shortly
after that.  The really funny part was he asked us why we kicked him.  I did
explain it to him in hopes that he would become a better "group" player.  I
have to assume that he was a young player and just didn't get it.  The other
possibility is that he was just plain out to Mess with people.

Anyway, I digress.  Up until this point I have been very happy effectively
"solo'ing" guildless.

What are the benefits of a guild?  What guilds are actively friendly and
encourage Growth?  The last guild I joined for several short hours was
actively interested in bossing me around and having me run all across the
Karana's trying to grow the guild like a virus.  I am interested in actively
participating in leveling and getting quest items to increase my
intelligence and mana.  I don't mind taking orders, but I do mind wasting my
time running around doing errands.  I want to group and actively seek
experience, or even go out with some higher level members to "Power Level".
I of course can contribute my wizard skills, and eventually my Gating
abilities to the higher planes.

If you are a member of such a guild on Mithinal Marr, and are in the
Freeport area, I'd like to hear from you and possibly consider joining up
with your guild.  I think it is time.

Sincerely,

Kevin Hill
