The top dogs in our guild take great joy in telling me how I will "look
back fondly on how fast 54 went by."

*sigh*
One month in 54. (Of course I raid a lot and die a fair share as MT/SA)
Last night the Hole was camed and we went to OoT to pull Seafuries for a
while, just to grind. They are about 2/3 full blue with some light blues
thrown in. Same mob range as the Hole, though without the sweet xp
bonus. Three hours of that and I got a *shade* over two blue.

*sigh*  Four blue to go. Maybe today. Maybe tomorrow.
