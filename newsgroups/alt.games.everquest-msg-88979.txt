BTW new to group and yes i've experienced this exact problem in CB, once.

Rule of thumb is to be polite and try to work out an arrangement, in my case
i was just waiting for my long time friend to log in to port out. I was
offering buffs and sow for free at the zoneline when i had a lvl 18 warrior
get the "tough guy" mentality and do exactly the same thing.

Funny thing about lvl 50 ranger's, we don't die that easily i guess....he
camped pretty quickly after i sent him a private tell and removed /anon.

Bottomline is I will respect any wedding/funeral in game, but i won't be
bullied out of the zone, or to be quiet. I don't tend to yell or ooc enough
to be a bother. But i will offer advise if someone is asking in ooc/shout.
