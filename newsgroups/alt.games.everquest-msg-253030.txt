Very ZZZ.....temp needs a level limit for sure, +800hp at level 1 is stupid
(yes you can twink 800hp, but they stack so that argument is invalid).

Yes, I have used temp, never asked for it in an ldon with my lowbies though,
only to PL characters ('ruining' my own gameplay not boring others to
tears).

I reckon a few of the under 44 buffs need looking at (cleric mainly (temp),
then shaman (HoS etc).

A limit of 34 on 44 spells would be a good number I think.
