    You'll see. You'll see. "Oops, mistimed my joust due to lag. I'm dead. I
hope I died close enough to the main tank that the mob didn't pursue me
because of low health aggro, or I may very well have killed half the casters
on the raid. But hey, I did an extra 500 damage because I tried that!"

    Those "incredibly gimp tactics" got my guild one of the first serverwide
kills on Cursed. And those "incredibly gimp tactics" also work wonders on
Emmerick Skyfury, Solusek Ro, Fennin Ro....

    Mob does 3 K AoE, timed, no real chance of resisting. Mistime your
joust, you're close to 50% health with healers ignoring you to help keep the
MT up. Mistime a second joust, you're a stain and you may have just messed
up the positioning on the mob. All so you could do crummy damage anyways,
worse than if you just second boxed a caster. Those fights aren't fun, but
they're there.

> Walls, positioning, hiding

    Bwahahaha! Wall? WTF are walls? There's no walls in PoP! If you're
talking more in general about AoEs, then yes - having every melee avoid
every AoE in all of EQ is silly. Many can be resisted, many can be healed
against by a reasonable raid force. But what Hughes said is correct (eeeew,
did I just say that?) There are many mobs, especially in PoP, where you
won't allow melees into the AoE until very close to the end of the fight
because the risk of losing control is significant if someone lags.

    Some of those things work in some cases. RC is never a long-term
solution to keeping more than a few groups in a fight. Not all guilds can
support having one effective AoE healer in every group. The DPS of some AoEs
simply overwhelm any AoE Wood/Elixir/Paragon ideas you might want to
implement. Trust me.

    Being unable to do some damage at range is very limiting. You're a monk,
you should know all about that! ;-)
