You will need to have a 2nd video card installed.  A cheap way to do this
would be to get a video card and a cheap a/b box.  That way you could run
patch cables from the vid cards to the a/b box, then from the box to the
monitor and merely flip a switch to choose between video cards.  Of course
you will only be able to view one at a time, so make sure your character is
parked in a fairly safe spot while meddin/healing up, etc.  But this is a
much less expensive way to go and you don't have 2 big monitors cluttering
up your desk.

Good luck,
SEAN...
