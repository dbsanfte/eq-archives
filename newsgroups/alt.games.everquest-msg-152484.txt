I've logged into bazaar a few times recently and within a few seconds of
entering the game on a couple of occasions, I notice I've had a full stack
of 20 summoned food or water on my cursor.  It's not food left over from my
previous game session because it's happened when I've not been on for a
couple of days. Does anyone know why that would be happening?
