If it impacts the players ability to perform their duties as an
officer, then you should do something about it. Otherwise, I've been
in a guild before where my alts are far too low to do anything with
the guild, and as such having them join a more level appropriate guild
would have been the proper thing to do. As an officer though, it
probably wouldn't be feasible. But having one character to raid with
your main guild when a raid is called, and then leveling alts in
another guild, seems to be reasonable as long as there is no rule
against it, and it does not impact the responsibilities to the other
guild.
