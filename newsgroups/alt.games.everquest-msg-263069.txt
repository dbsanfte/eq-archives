It is highly likely that Warrior A makes certain to hit the mob with
a missile prior to using his Provoke-line combat ability, which I
have read shares the bad behavior (bug) of the SK pure hate spells.
Apparently, if you haven't damaged the mob at all most of the hate
from the pure hate abilities does not take effect.  If Warrior B is,
for instance, using his Provoke-line ability to pull, he's not going
to get anywhere near the fast +hate he can out of it.  I'm sure
there're other ways to have such a large and obvious difference in
initial aggro, but I'd be willing to bet (a small bet :-p) that that
is the key difference.
