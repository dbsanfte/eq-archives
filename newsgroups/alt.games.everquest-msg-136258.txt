EQ won't kick you out for lack of activity, no matter how long
you stay online.  Your ISP might object and cut your link, but
Verant won't care.  You could make a bazaar mule on a separate
account and leave him there 24x7.  I imagine some guilds are
already doing just that.  But there will be occasional LDs,
just the same as when you're playing; and in periods following
a major patch they seem to be more frequent.
