I play on Brell now, and I used to play on E'Ci.   find the players on Brell to
be much more layed back.  But there is A LOT of twinking on Brell.  However, I
started a necro and said I was'nt going to twink him.  At level 2 I had another
high level necro come up to me and offer me a bunch of things he was crafting,
some of the things were  couple hundred plat a piece, hence he is now twinked.

Sullon I find agressive, with a lot less morons, (If I could only convince my
frineds to play PvP).

I also found Bristelbane to be very power hungry, but I may have been with the
wrong people.
