    Breathe in, hold it, breathe out. Pause. Breathe in, hold it, breathe
out. Good.

    He just *might* want to know if others have used it so he can judge if
the people selling items are trustworthy. $175 is a fair chunk of cash to
just lose outright on a scammer.

    I wish I could. I just don't have the time to level up the twinks. Damn
job!

    Perhaps because he wants a Fungi tunic?

    It's a game. If you rant about people buying "virtual" items in a game
you are a pathetic loser with more time than sense. But that's just my
opinion. It's your time, spend it ranting however you like.

> Its really true a fool and his money are soon parted.

    A fool and his opinions, however, are inseparable.

    I'm really surprised at the amount of vitriol people get who ask about
things like Playerauctions. Is it so hard to state "the rules forbid the
selling and buying of items outside the game, be aware some of these items
are sold by scam artists, and the average 'fully-geared' character that goes
up for sale on Playerauctions is BACK for sale within two weeks"? Why the
outpouring of hate (and it wasn't just the original poster) for someone who
has decided "hey, maybe I don't want to spend a week of time camping an
item"? Educate, don't berate!
