If your sense heading is in your number 1 ability slot, then put this in a
social, and hotkey it if you want.

/pause 55,/doability 1
/pause 55,/doability 1
/pause 55,/doability 1
/doability 1

Might need to adjust the pause time, don't remember the recycle time on
sense heading off hand.  The units are tenths of a second.  This will do
sense heading 4 times.
