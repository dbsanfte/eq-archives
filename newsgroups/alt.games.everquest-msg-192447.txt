Actually...*squint*...there is a city in my homestate called Freeport.  I
don't believe names are copyright under US/international law
(http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ34.html).  But yes, by and large, you
are right.  Fortunately this isn't a question of Artist vs. Sony...it's
Artist vs. Nasty-Bad Guildthing.  While we're busy debating whether
whether Amulett or Sony has copyright to her artwork...we can all agree
that Nasty-Bad Guildthing does _not_ have rights to the artwork, yes?  
(Sorry, my ElfQuest influence is showing through.)

*grin* And y'know...at least 50% of everquest art seems to feature druids
with said blower.  That, or high elf clerics with water sprinklers.   Some
character art I've seen is pretty ambiguous, though, especially when folks
adapt clothing and appearance for aesthetics.

More or less, yes.  Though how that translates in legal code, I don't
know. 

Here's something to ponder then....

Back to my own fan fiction story.  I submitted it to the producer of the
original creation (ElfQuest in this case) for possible consideration.  The
story includes very-much trademarked characters, so there is no question
that it's "his turf".  Since he owns the copyright, what prevents him from
publishing a story I wrote without giving me credit or possibly paying
me?  It's his copyright, after all.

Just so, couldn't SOE take Amulett's art and put it on the cover of their
game boxes, without giving her credit or payment? It's their copyright,
yes?

(This is stuff I REALLY should know better if I want to be published
someday.)

> Spike = The Man. 

/agree!  

And that's one of my favorite quotes of his.  Though it's hard to pick a
favorite...whoever scripted his earlier episodes was f*cking gifted.
