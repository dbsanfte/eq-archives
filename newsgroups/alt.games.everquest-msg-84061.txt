I'd never known that,and I've been playing rogue since April
of 99.  That is incredible.

And I do believe you...just seems like the sorta thing that
could happen..kind of like trying to hide on a moving boat...
sometimes it works, sometimes you get the "can't hide when
moving' message.

I'd always just gotten the message and stopped...can't
wait until the next Kedge raid.  Screenshots of Phinny and
me having lunch, anyone? :-)
