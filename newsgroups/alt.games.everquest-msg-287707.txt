I know this patch is still for a =93test=94, there are so many changes
these days.
Survivability is something we're discussing a lot right now. We've
heard from many players that burst damage feels really high and that
healing might not even be that useful at the moment. We're seeing lots
of Arena teams with all dps at all. That is an interesting option and
we don't want to make it impossible to play that style, but we wonder
if the pendulum has swung too far in that direction. If it has, and
it's too soon to know, we first want to address that on the damage
side of things rather than individually buffing every class to provide
more survivability.
New glyphs:
Yup. We want it to be exciting when a new glyph for a big ability is
finally available. We also didn't make many glyphs for new abilities
because we thought the glyphs wouldn't feel interesting -- when you
get a new ability and immediately glpyh it, then it feels like that's
just the way the ability works all the time.
Eventually, we expect there will be many glyphs and multiples for some
of the same abilities and you'll have to put some thought into which
ones you want.

patch.
