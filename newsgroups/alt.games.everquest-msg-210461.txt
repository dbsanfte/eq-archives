I disagree.  I have been in groups where we had Two Shamans, Cleric , Two
Warriors and an additional melee type.  Our DPS was sweet.  I know many
think two shamans in a group is overkill but for the last week, our guild
has been fighting in Veksar.  Last night we were taking out Highborns with a
60 Shaman, 57 Shaman, 59 Druid, 56 Warrior, 56 Paladin and 57 Monk.  We
owned these mobs and the occasional named 62-63 level mobs.  At these levels
and against these types of mobs, Shaman's slow spells are resisted a lot.
It is a great combo to have one shaman crippling and slowing the mobs while
the other buffs the tanks and other melees.

As far as rangers go, they own when it comes to ranged attack.  They can
also pull pretty good using their snare spell.  And tracking is also a great
feature.  But they are definitely not a tank calss melee.  If you are
content staying at a distance  and shooting missles at a mob while the other
melees are beating mobs up then the Ranger is a good class.
