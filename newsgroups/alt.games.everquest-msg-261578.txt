I believe that a druid friend and myself duoed in Noble's Causeway to get
the blood and scroll drops, and got the crystal drops in Dranik's. Done in a
couple of short sessions. The bloods appear to drop infrequently off trash
on Noble's as do the scrolls iirc although I'm sure there's other places to
get em. Ukuns, Ferans etc although I never saw anything drop from the
murkgliders for the ports. Hope this is of some help anyway.
