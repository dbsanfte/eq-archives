All he had to do to check if they were 10 dose potions was right-click for
about a second.  You CAN'T possibly charge someone for something they don't
get in this game (unless you promise to give them the plat with another
character and then don't come back, but that is a different situation
entirely and does not apply in this case).  There was no scam if they both
clicked "trade."  The mistake was made by the buyer, for not checking what
he bought BEFORE he clicked "trade."
