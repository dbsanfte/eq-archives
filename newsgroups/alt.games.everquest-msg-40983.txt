Been watching extra news broadcasts all afternoon here, starting from
when they announced that a single plane had crashed. This is just
nuts... how the fuck can someone be evil and insane enough to pull
this kind of shit?? Whoever they are, they are perfect specimens of
the excrement of the human race, and so are anyone who thinks this is
a good thing (just heard on the news that some palestinian people were
cheering the terrorist attacks, are they out of their minds??)

My condolences to all Americans.

(Kudos to CNN.com for minimizing their website to the point where it
became possible to connect to it)
