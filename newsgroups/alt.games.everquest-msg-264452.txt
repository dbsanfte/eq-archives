Your analysation is all fine but you don't include the way some people
like to play their chanter. Like me. ;)
I don't care for the safest single pull strategy. If we get a train then
so be it. Half the fun is dealing with the unexpected. That is what the
enchanter class is made for imho.

And the discussion of the weak nukes is moot. If you want your enchanter
going dps then let her/him charm something. This will far outdamage
everything the chanter could throw in a fight. If you only fight single
pulls then this is the way to go. Otherwise your chanter might get bored
to death. ;)

Besides the lvl64 nuke (can't remember the english name offhand) does
have a quite good dmg/mana ratio. 1100 damage for only 300 mana looks
quite promising. The only downside is the rather long recast time.
