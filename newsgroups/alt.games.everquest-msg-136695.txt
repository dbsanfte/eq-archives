    Well, I chose Wood Elf for my original bard and am thinking about making
a new one that is Vah Shir. Stats wise, it's basically a toss-up between
Wood Elf and Human. Humans might have a small advantage if I remember
correctly, but Wood Elves can see in the dark. :)
    If you really wanted to do Vah Shir, there are usually a couple of
people who can port who are in Shar Vahl or Shadeweavers Thicket. Just ask
them to port you closer to your friends.
