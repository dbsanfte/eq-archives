#2 gets to pick what they want from the remaining items, not the '2nd' 
item. They can choose an upgrade if they like and one is available or 
they can pick the biggest cash drop.

"Those who can use roll" is essentially an NBG system, which is subject 
abuse and thus not popular for pickup groups. If you want to run an NBG 
group, then this system is only applicable for 'big cash drops' like 
droppable tradeskill items etc after the nbg stuff is rolled out.

Somebody is still going to go home empty handed. Might as well get it 
over with quickly, especially since the odds don't change by dragging it 
out.
