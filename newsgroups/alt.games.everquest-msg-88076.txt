As a tech lead I had assumed a programmer would know that
computers know diddly-squat (sorry for the technical term for
all you non-techies) about hours or even minutes.   I'd suggest
the obvious course is to convert to the base unit (seconds) and
look at the number in a format the computer can recognize
(hexadecimal).  If I'd have to say de word (heh-heh), I'd say you
made a bizarre assumption for a programmer to make.  ;)

(If I was on their engineering team, I'd have a bit somewhere that
tells the server when to remove the corpse.  Running a timer and
then setting that bit would be all that would have been required
before they made the information public.   With a bit flag set, a
corpse removal routine could run only at certain ticks, reducing
the load on the server.   The "bad" message would be an artifact
of just such a system.)
