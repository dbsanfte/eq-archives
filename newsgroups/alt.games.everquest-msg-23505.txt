Sur la boite il y est des instructions tres clair - "vous avez besoin d'etre
sur le net (Internet Connection Required)"  et "30 jours gratis!  Carte de
credit requis.. (30 days free play.  Valid credit card required)"

Qu'est-ce que t'as pense?  What did you think that meant?
Je sais bien que vous avez des boites *en francais* en France - j'etais la.
I know that you have the boxes in French in France (part of the import
laws).

Ce ne sert rien.  That'll do no good.
T'auras besoin d'un accompte quand meme.  You'd still need a valid account
to play.

Ah yes, I'd forgotten how french kids just *love* to use every english swear
word.  They used to like to say "fuck" when I was doing ESL classes over
there and the teachers would just roll their eyes and chuckle.  No
discipline.
