Haven't had much trouble with most of these missions, but there was
one in Rujark where the boss was exceedingly tough at level 65.  Fight
lasted perhaps 5 minutes, during which the tank was rezzed twice while
we tried to hold off the mob.

A nice touch, and one that could increase demand, would be to actually
have the named DROP items.  Any assassinate I've done, the mob never
dropped a thing.  It seems logical that a named should be capable of
dropping, or have a chance of dropping an item.  Other nameds do in
LDON.
