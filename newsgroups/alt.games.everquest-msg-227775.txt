Heh, I'm guessing this is why our [only] bona fide uberguild is
shedding players like a two week old Xmas tree sheds needles.  How
many pieces of Time loot do you NEED before the tedium of tearing
through it all again kills your enthusiasm to carry on forever?

"Hmm, we had a Paladin tank Quarm last time, perhaps we can try a Bard
today...."

Anyway, if the 7800 point Warrior had more points than the 8700
Warrior then he'd have been able to buy the upgrade, next time it
drops he'll probably get it so I don't really see the problem.  It's
like a Bard buying an Ifir - fairly stupid in the min/max way of
thinking but if some low points newb Rogue wants it then he can get in
line behind the 500 raid vet Bard (IMO).

What ruined DKP for me (and raiding in general actually, I might try
again in a while having too much fun right now though) was corruption
from the very top allowing the 'in crowd' to 2-3-4 box each other at
every raid making it almost impossible for anyone outside the clique
to compete on a level playing field.  Raids turning to shit due to the
hordes of AFK bots being tagged along on shitty laptops were a huge
chunk of no fun as you can well imagine.  Nothing quite like the
indignant FURY of a hardcore multiboxer when confronted by the facts
either.
