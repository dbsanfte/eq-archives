I feared as much... The thing is that I have an absolutely stupid amount
of peripherals hanging off the back of my computer, and the idea of
installing drivers for all of them after a system wipe fills me with
existential angst. Besides, I know MS is going to start undermining
people using W9* OSs to force them to upgrade, so I'd rather be ahead of
the curve than behind it.

If I could afford it, what I would do is downgrade to W98 in my PC, and
leave it exclusively for EQ and a few other games, and buy a Mac for all
real work/hobbies/messing about. 

Anyway, I think I'll go and get XP, and hope for the best. Bah.
