Unfortunately, explanations on your part are totally worthless at this
point. Your little "crusade" has made shown you as a fool.

It's bad enough you act an idiot, now you are trying to justify doing so.
Pick a path and follow it for crying out loud.  The further you go with
this, the more pathetic you are becoming.

If you are trying to scrape up whatever respect you feel you need from
people here, you might as well give up. No quantity of  ass-kissing will
change the impression you've already made of yourself.

Looks like you've bottomed out, pal.
