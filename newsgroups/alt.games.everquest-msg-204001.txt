I only saw the new Erudite male with the bottom of his robes sticking out
like a tent, but if they were all as bad as it this could have been the
worst change of all time.  Apparently a lot of folks didn't like these since
they're now being redone; I hope they can do better next time.  No one was
complaining about the old running and walking animations anyway, it was the
weapon animations (specifically 2hb, or lack thereof) that people were
concerned about.
