<<snip discussion of Fansy the Famous Bard>>

Did anyone else notice how many of the people who really hated Fansy
were blatently violating the naming conventions?  I noticed the
following, which are questionable at least:

Flowerpowa 
Puffpuf 
Griefing 
Showmee 
Watchyah 
Shortdawg 
Lendalzepperlin 
Pignut 
Tobaccoman 
Sowaholic 
Jomoma 
Cypriss (bet money his surname is hyll or something similar)
Gankin 
Ihatefansy 
Muddah 
Idontlikefansy 
Cheetoer 

GO GO GOOD TEAM!
