:D  In that case, I'll have a Red Bull.

And if anyone can tell me what in that stuff makes me so HAPPY (I know it
isn't the caffeine) I'd sure appreciate it.  I'm starting to get just a
LITTLE worried about how much I crave that drink.  It's getting to the
point where I have a hard time sitting at my monitor to draw if I can't
sip on some, and I've even berated myself that I didn't make a CoH
character named Red Bull in appropriate gear.

This must be compensation for all those years of not liking alcohol and
feeling jealous of all the other kiddies who have a drink that they'll not
only go to absurd lengths to acquire, but which they can have long,
emotional conversations about.
