Mistake one - you're modified int should be 173

You lost mana do to the wrong number above -
hence the negative extra mana

24 * (173/5 + 2) = 24 * (34.6 +2) = 24*(36.6) = 878.4

878.4 + 20 (from items) = 898.4

so 1 bubble is 180mana.  The other 20 mana for the
spell is only 1/9th of a bubble and can easily be
masked by the coarseness of the display on the mana
bar.  Also - depending on your specialization - you 
could be saving a small (10ish) mana on the pet.  So,
~900 mana sounds pretty close to right.
