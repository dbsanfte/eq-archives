    Balance means equivalency not cloning. I'm not surprised Sony can't tell
the difference, but you're smart enough to spot it, surely.

    I rolled a class I enjoyed. Some years later I was still enjoying that
class, and even had the incredible honour of being Raid MT for the odd
luclin or PoP target. But watching my guild wipe against previously trivial
content because our lesser comparitive geared/AA'd warrior MT quit, or
standing next to my comparible Paladin buddy in group content and having him
confirm a clear advantage... these were Not Cool.

    The kicker, though, was starting an Enchanter alt and realising how
incredibly quick it was to get groups or gain levels soloing when I didn't
feel like grouping. Grouping with people 5-10 levels above me because my
skillset is that in demand and that flexible. Hitting the early 50's and
buying better gear HP-for-HP than my 70 SK had with a fraction of the time
and plat outlay...

    ...gear the enchanter didn't need...

    bah, I don't know why I'm ranting away.

    Thanks for those words of wisdom, and may I express my gratitude along
with my sincerest congratulations that you have played such a difficult
race/class combination as {$soloable_caster_x} to such a high level as
{$level}.
