There's another way to describe 'attacking an argument'.  It's called 
'constructing a counter-argument'.  Cleverness may not impress you, but 
then, I consider cleverness a virtue.  Lack of cleverness is almost sinful 
in its ability to bore me, and therefore impinge upon my personal 
happiness (reference the earlier definition of evil...)

Note, also, that 'sophistry' is subjective.  What you here label 
sophistry, in an attempt to dismiss it, appears to me to be a well thought 
out, carefully constructed, admittedly clever (however unvirtuous that may 
be) counter argument.  Now, calling someone else's argument 'sophistry', 
attempting to dismiss it with a somewhat loaded term, particularly when 
it's unwarranted... how evil can you get?
