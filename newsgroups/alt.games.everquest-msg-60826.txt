When I got this far I thought "yeah, it doesn't sound like he's gonna like
this game."   Hell, that's how I'm feeling in DAOC...I'm playing it only
because a couple friends are.  If they're not on, I don't play 'cause it's
drudgery.

Then I got further into your post and I think I know the problem, and Lokari
did answer it, I'm just backing her up....

Sounds like you need to try a different race/class combo.  It COULD very
well be that being a PALADIN is not for you.  Hell, I started with a dark
elf SK or a human warrior (I forget my very first).  I didn't have much fun
until my dwarf cleric and that got boring around 14 so I started a gnome
enchanter, wood elf bard, and gnome mage.  I had a LOT of fun playing the
bard & mage.

I DID NOT want to play a druid...EVERYONE was a druid, sounded boring.  A
friend nagged me and showed me how much fun she was having, so I tried a
wood elf druid and fell in love with it.  Got up to about 46 and bored
(still playing all those previous fun classes) so played my enchanter.  Got
HIM up to 55, and my druid up to 52 (two accounts, 2 computers :) ).

It is EXTREMELY important to find a race/class that fits you, otherwise the
game just won't be much fun.  You wear your character the same way you wear
shoes...how long can you go wearing your wife's high heels?  Ok, don't
answer that. :)

I'm not pushing any race/class combo.  I can't read your mind, I have no
idea what you'd like.  I might RECOMMEND you try a pure caster though (a
class that gets spells at level 1) and if that doesn't float your boat,
maybe a pure melee (non-caster).  You probably have 8 character slots (if
you're on FV server that can't help the situation :p ).
