 Uh.. yeah.. the shift+cursor editting commands have been in the game 
for a long time. Also shift+end and shift+home will send the cursor to
the end and beginning of your line of text. Shift+up cursor and Shift+down
cursor will cycle through past chat/tells/commands sent.
 
 There are quite a few other very powerful key combos. Try reading the 
eqmanual_supplement.doc and/or everquest_manual.doc located in your 
EQ folder. I think you'll find many, many neato things in there you 
are also completely unaware of.
