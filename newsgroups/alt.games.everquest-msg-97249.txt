They are negatives because to those who oppose them, they cheapen the
game.  You don't have to agree with that, but not admitting that
others might just see it that way makes further discussion rather
pointless.
The basic argument is this:  For one reason or another, Everquest is
much more difficult to play than most games.  EQ has slightly
different demographics than other games.  A significant number of the
people playing LIKE the fact that it's hard, and that it discourages
grief players and children.  The latest round of announced changes are
so shocking (based on numerous past statements by Verant staff) that
people are afraid that the design team will go too far, and make the
game as easy as the average single-player game.  For many of us, that
is a bad thing.  You may hate the spellbook, CR, and low levels enough
that you think this is a reasonable tradeoff.  Others hate those
features a lot less than they hate an invasion of griefers and idiots.
I found none of those things to negatively impact my play, though I
have only a single low-level twink that has ever dealt with the
spellbook.  On the other hand I'm sure I've died as much as anyone in
the game.
