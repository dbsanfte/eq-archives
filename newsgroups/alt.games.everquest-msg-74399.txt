I'd vote for an alternate set of spell slots. In order to keep class
balance, perhaps the alternate slots could be for buffs only. That way
a buffer can do buffs, then still heal or fight with spell swapping so
much. But this way, it wouldn't increase the number of damage spells
they could have up. Just a thought.
