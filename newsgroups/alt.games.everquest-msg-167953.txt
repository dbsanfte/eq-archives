I think you have your terms confused.  Twinking is generally "hooking up"
one of your characters with gear they normally couldn't obtain by themselves
for that level.  What I think your refering to is "2 boxing".  This requires
2 seperate accounts, and usually 2 seperate computers but that isn't always
the case.  I've heard of people running up to 3 accounts on the same
computer by using EQ Windows.
