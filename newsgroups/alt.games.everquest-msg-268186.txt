*shrug*  Look at all the things in the EQ "vision" which
went bye-bye.   What developers now say isn't the
way they'll necessarily end up.

The other problem is "what do groups do when they
hit 50?"  (Or any other level limit.)   In EQ there's
raid content -- and AAXP for groups.   Maybe
there will be a TON of upper-level quests done at
the group level -- but I'd say building 'raid content'
is a lot easier.   At any rate, EQ2 won't survive unless
it has *something* for high-level players -- and the
easiest, most cost-effective way to do that is 'raid
content.'

Huh?  Concentration slots only affect the caster -- and
only then with the buffs that require them.   A mid-teens
druid easily has 6 up *solo* -- and that's using only two
concentration slots...
