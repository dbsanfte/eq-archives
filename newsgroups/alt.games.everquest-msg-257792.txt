  Many developments these past couple of weeks, starting with, of
course, Aerin'Dar.

  I waited over a month for an open AD raid in my time slot, after
midnight EDT. I finally got one...in a week when my karma was going
down, meaning a likely failure. Things actually seemed to go smoothly
enough at first: get to PoV, get invited, get coth'd, group-disband to
allow the next invite. When everyone was in the prep room, all left
the raid for a more organized reinvite. Buff up, med up, touch the orb
to get into the containment chamber, more waiting, buffs rotting, have to
recast...but finally AD gets pulled.
  Inc dragon. Do not attack until assist is called! Stay in range of bard
resist songs! But the resist songs aren't helping with the AE DD...I watch
my health go down in steps until, finally, at 11%, assist is called.
Needless
to say, I don't get anything done before I'm dead.
  I get back to the guardhouse and wait for the wipe. But we don't wipe:
the dragon goes down! Hurray! Now for the rezzing...there ARE some
rezzers still alive, aren't there? Well, yes, but it seems they are all
pallies,
and they lose their heads, rezzing melees to deal with the minions still
being
kited rather than the clicky-clerics we need.... Eventually, the minions are
down, rezzing begins in earnest, but wait! There's no PP! Frantic scrolling
up to see who hailed it. No one...just one of those things. It is later
found that
checking AD's loot starts a 10-minute timer on the PP. It took a good deal
longer than that to get everyone rezzed and deal with the minions. Ahh,
well,
now we know.

  The very next DAY, there is another AD raid. This time with TWO coth
anchors! Things go faster. We get into the chamber, pull AD, and this time I
stay
on the other side of the chamber, waiting for him to get down to a
respectable
80% or so before charging in. But it takes a while to get him there...too
many
people are dying...70%, I'm still not sure...60%...In the end, I don't move,
and
we only get him to 42% before wiping. I don't have Egress up, and trying to
mem it leads to aggro and death. Another failure.
  Both times, it seemed to me we had more healing power than we needed to
keep the MT alive, but the extra healers were focussed on him and not
pumping
HP to other people in the raid, so our DPS fell off sharply. Hopefully I
will
eventually get a raid that works properly and get the flag. For now, another
long wait.

  After these raids I decide my karma won't let me get anything nice done
for a
while, so I go for AA's and money. And some work on Rabotev's epic; after
getting the Corrupted Mammoth and Hill Giant peices, it seemed not so much a
bother to collect ahead. Eventually I collected everything except Faydedar,
Ulump,
and VSR pieces, and the Jade Reaver. I broke down and got a Jade Reaver in
the
Bazaar, got up to the Softly Glowing Stone, turned it in to Foloal...and she
ate it.
Only THEN do I hail her and try dialogue. Looks like I'll have to do a lot
of
stuff over again...

  I managed to meed Jenaii, playing Healea Sternstar, during an LDoN
mission.
Worked out rather well. /wave

  Bored last Sunday, checked Groups LFP...found one advertising an open
Fear raid. Led by Vraa, fellow uber-wizzie who does Fear about as often as
my friend Kam. I arrive to find the western half of the zone already dead;
the
raid has been going on for some time. I provide substantial help clearing
out more
stuff. We have trouble with the dracoliche - Vraa insists on getting it out
of the way
to make the mid-zone more manageable. Finally getting it down, we are ready
to do
the Broken Golem. There are only three wizards in raid...Vraa, me, and a
level 57
who apparently left his sprocket back in the bank. I had brought mine just
on the
off chance BG might be open roll...but now I was the only one who needed it,
in a position to immediately do it. Grats Ada! Now she only needs VS, whom,
Kam
informs me, has been nerfed recenly, to the point of being one-groupable.
Now
we have to be able to get together when VS is up.

  May have a lot to do this weekend...
