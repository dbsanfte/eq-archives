*chuckle* Ironically, you just twinked one of the few non-twinked rogues 
out there.  NOT that I'm complaining.

Ah yes.  I dunno why more people don't play rogues.  "You have just 
smacked a goblin for 161 points, and he's HITTING SOMEONE ELSE!" "You 
have just smacked a goblin and he noticed, but by pressing that little 
button over there, he goes back to ... HITTING SOMEONE ELSE!"  And leave 
us not forget sneak/hide.  Actually, the guild leader I mentioned just 
started a rogue alt the other day.  I met her to hand her some of my old 
gear (Twinking my guild leader who is 20+ levels above me.  Must not be 
smug. Must not be smug. Must not be......) and as she hung around in HHK 
waiting for me I suddenly get a tell of "I can buy from vendors by 
standing behind them!!!!!!"  Awww, how cute *g*

Hm yeah I tried RPing a few times.  I've decided I'm not cut out for it 
as a constant.  Therefore I'll just do it every so often.  Usually when 
I start playing in enclosed spaces with large races.  /em scowls at an 
ogre, ready to attack.

I really can't say anything except "me too" :D

> Hope it's helping!

Oh it is, it IS!  I can get *hit* now!  I don't fall down!  And I won't 
even mention how pretty my damage looks just flying by, even with my 
misses and the mobs misses and everybody else's hits/misses turned off.

I do, however, have a few guildies and friends looking at my gear lately 
and twitching. *g*  Thank god this isn't a little more real, or I think 
you'd find my stripped body shoved in a hole somewhere in the Freeport 
sewers.
