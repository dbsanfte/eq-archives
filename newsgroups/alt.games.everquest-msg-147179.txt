Emm, can you ungroup your Ranger and solo (badly) during the down time ?

Or can you root all 4 instead of the last DD then camp / relog the druid
while the ranger finishes them ? (It will be during the downtime anyhow)

Or can you get your ranger a group somewhere nice, and use the druid
(non grouped) to heal / buff etc. to reduce the wole group's downtime ?

HTH
