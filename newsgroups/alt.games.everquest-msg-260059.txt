Ive been playing on the Rathe server for quite some time now. Is there a
dedicated open raid night? Do they happen very often? Just curious, my guild
isn't very large and seems to get smaller day by day. This seems like the
only way I would be able to get tagged for some of the PoP zones. Any help
would be appreciated.
