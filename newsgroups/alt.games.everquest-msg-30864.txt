    Why would you waste so much time trying to talk him out of it?
    Express your concerns... he insists.
    Get paid, port him, and be done with it.

    If I needed a port, and the would be porter tried to talk me out of
it... I'd say "have a nice day" and continue looking for a port.
    Now, that being said, I have talked guys out of ports that were truely
stupid...
    i.e. the BRAND NEW level one human warrior in Qeynos who wants a port to
Freeport because his friends are there... "Why not just make another brand
new level 1 human warrior with Freeport as your starting city?"
    Or the level 8 half elven ranger who wants a port to Cazic Thule because
it's close to Feerrott where his ogre friend is (and no druids are around).
Though if he'd argued with me, and said he wanted it... then I'd have
collected my fee, and sent him in... and collected again when I sent him for
his corpse... and again for that one... until he either ran out of money, or
realized that this was not a smart course of action and considers that
equipment lost.
