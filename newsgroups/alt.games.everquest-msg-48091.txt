Can't see how they'd ban it, or under what grounds. OK, so they can ban
you for wearing an orange t-shirt while paying EQ if they want, it's
their game, but EQW doesn't seem to be breaking any existing rules. From
what I've read, it's a launcher of sorts. Doesn't modify any EQ files,
doesn't change gameplay any more than having 2 physical PCs would (which
isn't illegal). Sure it *could* be used to run background macros, memory
editers, etc. and goes against EQ's wishes to not multitask, but without
spelling out 'Thou shalt not multi-task' it doesn't seem to break any
existing rules. The fact that WinXP also negates the multitask
restrictions, makes this point even more mute
