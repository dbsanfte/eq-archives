Apparently there are 2 kinds of collection quests.

If you are asked to get less than 25 objects, there are only 30 in the
zone.

If you are asked to get more than 25, then there are a lot more in the
zone.


I heard this from someone and when thinking back, the only collection
quests that I've had a lot of trouble with have been the 23's.  So, I
can't comfirm, but my evidence suggests that the person who told me
about this was correct.
