It's not the regen rate, can't you see that?  No wait ... you obviously
can't.  It's what you do with the obese mana pool you have.  Once you're
medding, you're not in anyone's hair.

It's the "I paid 50 plat for this buff, I'm going to get the most out of it
I can.  And damn anyone else who gets in my way" attitude people get when
they have one, even out of normally nice players.  You ever know anyone who
was a great guy most of the time, but get him drunk and he becomes an
asshole?  That's the way some people get once they've paid 50 plat for a
buff.

But it no longer matters, does it?  They can't get it now.
