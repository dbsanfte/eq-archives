<snip explanation of mana regen method>

No horse, no KEI, strictly using Cann IV + torpor, for mana regen.  82 
mana/tick - 200 mana every 15ish ticks, and skip 2 ticks.  So, 60.5 mana 
per tick when going strictly mana regen.  Toss in a horse for 20, KEI for 
14, that's 94.5 mana per tick, with no AAs or focus gear.  Cann V is 2.5 
second cast for 1066 mana, minus 200 for Torpor or Quiescence to regain 
the health lost.  Not sure on refresh time off hand on Cann V, lucy says 
recast is 69 seconds.  That nets 866 mana over about 2 ticks, every 69 
seconds or so.  Subtract 121 not gained from Cann IV while doing that, so 
745 mana.  That adds 64.8 mana per tick to the equation.

So, not counting horse or KEI, or standing mana regen, a shaman with 
Cannibalization and Torpor and Cann IV, going full mana regen, should be 
able to hit about 125 mana per tick.  Cut the Cann IV part in half to 
allow for casting other spells, reduce the Cann V by a bit for the same 
reason, not going to hit it optimally all the time, still leaves a shaman 
at 90ish mana per tick, with no buffs, horse, or focus gear.

Going full out mana regen, say, after a death, I regen mana at 145 mana 
per tick, including my horse, that is with Cann V, Quiescence, Cann IV.  
Actually, I regen it a touch faster, as I have SCM2, and SCRM to reduce 
the cost or Quiescence, and increase it's duration.  I do not have any 
other focus items to help with the equation.  Oh, add 14 to that for MC3 
and FT11.

Hmm, did I miss something?  I'm sure if I did, it will be pointed out 
here.

What is the actual max a self buffed only mage can regen mana at?
