Since the latest patch, my game has been crashing at exactly the same point every time.
I start the game, I log in, I select my server and hit connect.

Instead of "loading, please wait", the screen goes black for 20-30 seconds, and then I
get an illegal operation error about eqgfx_dx8.dll.  I deleted that file and
redownloaded it, same error.  I uninstalled the whole game (even deleted the folder) and
reinstalled it, *still* no good.

Anyone have any ideas what's going on?
