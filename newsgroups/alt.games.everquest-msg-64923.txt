There seems to be hope.

---snippet from post---
Hello Folks,
We are starting testing on the Intel graphics boards and will be advising on fixes and issues as soon as we can.

Unfortunately I don't have an ETA on when any information will be available.

In order to clean up these boards I will be deleting the posts on this issue; this does not mean that we are ignoring you or this
issue.

In the meantime, if you have not done so already go to [url]www.intel.com[url] and look for the latest DX8.1 compliant drivers, and
if you find drivers that work for you please let us know.

Thank you in advance for your patience.
