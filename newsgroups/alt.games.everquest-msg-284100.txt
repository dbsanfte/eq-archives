My attitude reflects the rude welcome I have received. The whole point of 
being here is to learn and get other views. But to be told clerics are not 
needed and useless is garbage. Most people seek out clerics. While other 
classes can heal, they certainly are not the best. Clerics are the best of 
the healers and rezzers. I'm sure someone will dispute that, but even the 
makers of the game classify us as the best in the business. :)
