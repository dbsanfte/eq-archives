I have a macro set up to do a "/loc" and a "/doability 1" (which is "sense
heading" for me) and "/time".  I recently was looking at my macros, and when
I opened this one, I was surprised to see a "/duel" in there.  (Which did
clear up the mystery of how the hell I challenged someone to a duel a few
weeks ago, at least, when I was just going about my business).

I have no idea how this got there.  I certainly didn't put it there.  The
only account sharing I've done with this account was about a year ago.  I
changed the password, gave it to a RL friend so he could use my Wizard to
port one of my characters from my other account, and then changed the
password back afterward, so it is unlikely that he did it.

I suppose that macros are stored locally, so someone could have made the
change on my computer, but that seems unlikely.  My Windows machine is only
turned on when I'm playing EQ or NWN or Quake 3.  It's off the rest of the
time.  Furthermore, I've got a firewall between my LAN and my IDSL modem,
which is configured pretty tightly (only ssh and a couple of custom ports
for applications I do for work are open, and those are set up to forward to
my Linux box, not my Windows box).

My LAN has no wireless access points, either.

My friend whom had brief access to my account a year ago *does* have my
spare apartment key...but it is hard to believe that he would come over,
sneak in, boot my Windows machine, and hack my macros.  It's even more
farfetched to think that a stranger broke in to do it.  (No, there is
nothing missing from my apartment that I've noticed, nor any sign of
anything disturbed).

So, anyone have any theories as to how this got there?  Anyone else ever
seen a strange command show up in a macro?

My first thought was to blame it on something to do with the new interface,
but the incident a few weeks ago where I found myself challenging someone to
a duel and couldn't understand how I did so was before the new interface
came out.
