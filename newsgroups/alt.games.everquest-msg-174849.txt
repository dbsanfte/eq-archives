Stand back and observe them for a minute or two. If they're casters
they'll likely cast buffs of some sort on themselves and nearby allies.
If you catch them right when they spawn, casters will almost always
immediately start buffing.

Not only are there druids among the Karana bandits, there are wizards
too. Very nasty.
