The folks who see a warning and protect themselves do not make a lot of
noise about it.  This does not mean they don't exist.  Don't assume that
just because a single idiot gets killed because he was too stupid to
move that no one benefits from a warning.  If you are able to warn, do
so, if you are unable to warn, well then you are unable so that assumes
you have no choice.  I add that last part because we all know situations
where trying to send a shout or even finding a train macro may be enough
to get us killed.  In those situations I'm all for letting the chips
fall where they may, but if its possible to warn then its only polite. 
Even if you do hate everyone around you enough to not care if they live
or die.
