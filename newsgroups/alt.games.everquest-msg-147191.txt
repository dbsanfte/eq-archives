Because in order for it to be actually noticeable exp, they'll probably
have to put a modifier on the group exp.

That said, there are only certain areas where the exp is actually worth
worrying about. If you're doing a Vox or Naggy raid, there's little or
no exp for anyone, as you're only killing one mob. Ditto for most Kunark
content. In velious most first broods require little or no clearing.
There's a little bit on Dain, little more on Tormax, and quite a lot in
nToV and ST if you clear down.

When you get to Luclin however, there's usually a LOT of clearing before
you get to the kill. Most of Ssra, Greigs, Akheva, Deep etc. all require
a large number of exp giving mobs to be killed as you fight to the boss.
Once you reach VT, that clearing is 99% of the killing for 10+ hours.
With the new experience changes, and most of these clearance mobs being
high blue at least, and often red, this equates to one or two groups
getting huge amounts of exp. Fancy a couple of free AA points? Invite a
few rogues and wizards into your group and soak it up. While the MTs and
pullers lose exp, the KS groups effectively chain pull red con mobs and
kill faster than light blues with zero downtime.

This causes a LOT of problems, partly because of actual custom made KS
groups, but more importantly, because of the perception that if you
aren't getting the exp, someone else is. The pullers are frequently out
of camp. The MTs have healers, as do the debuffers. This means the
people losing the most exp on a raid, are also the least likely to see
exp, because half their group is taken up with non-high-damage classes
before they even start.

I couldn't really see them putting raid exp into all zones, simply
because of the abuse of everyone in DL joining the same raid, to
multiply the exp each person gets, as well as some people not pulling
their weight. Then you have 3 or 4 guild exp groups in FG joining a
'raid' to multiply their exp. 

If they're putting in a multiplier it would have to be restricted to
non-expable zones: ToV, VT, maybe Ssra/Deep (though many people can exp
there), maybe the planes, etc.

If there's no multiplier, it's pitiful exp for everyone, but at least
you know one group isn't benefitting from your work (dog in the manger)
plus groups will be set up more with survival in mind, rather than
maximising exp gain while increasing the risk of death.

The most sensible way of doing it would be to have the multiplier bonus
directly related to the number of people in the 'raid', on a bell curve
so that maximum exp per player for a given kill is attained around 50-70
people. 2-3 groups wouldn't see much difference, and adding a dozen
'mules' at the zoneline would add little but lag. They should also put a
'distance from kill' restriction in, though I think that already exists,
to stop zoneline mules.

Great idea, fingers crossed it's implemented well.
