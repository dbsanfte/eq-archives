Do you remember how long it takes to memorize spells at that level?  I think
that Verant should let you just keep your spells memorized until level 10 or
11, that way the casters aren't inconvienced, and are put on a par with the
noncasters.  I was feeling seriously traumatized by this, I mean we are
talking about having to sit on my butt for a minute or more, fending off
wolves and skeletons whilst attempting to memorize my spells that I can
barely use because my skills are so low.  It was terrible, I was on my
fourth spell, when I got attacked yet again by a wolf, whom I dispatched,
(Ding! level 4), and had to sit down and memorize the rest of my spells.
And there were these warriors and rogues that just ran right back out and
killed things.
