Disclaimer:  I know that lots of people were very excited about the news of
a spiffy new UI, but somehow all this went over my head...I never knew we
were going to get a new interface, just that they were working on fixing the
current one to dump the windowed view.

Anyway, SINCE SoL came out and I learned about the interface I kinda got the
impression that "*hugely* more configurable" may be an accurate description.
Emphasis on the word "may" since I have zero insider knowledge and I may be
totally off base. :)

Enough disclaimers?
