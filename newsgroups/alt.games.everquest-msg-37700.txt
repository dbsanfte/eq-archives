|    Honestly, I think it's the brand new "feature". Question: how can you
|make a quest take every player that wants to do it a long time, making it
|"epic" in some way? Answer: force them to complete it over the course of
|several levels. The Crystallized Shadow Weapon quest in Stonebrunt is a
|great example of this - you have to kill the spiritlings at low level before
|they green, and you're nowhere near ready to go to ToFS at that point. So
|you HAVE to delay completion of the quest.

	Do they seriously expect people to keep stuff in the bank for thirty
levels?  So they can get, what, pocket change and faction in a zone they can't
hunt in any more?

|    But yeah, last night in SB was frustrating for a lot of people. They
|came to the zone hoping to at least do the quests, and were locked out. The
|shouts of frustration were rampant last night. Then add in how poor the
|hunting will likely be, and I imagine they just made a zone where the
|Snowbeast will be camped, and not much else.

	I expect that once the blossom is off the rose, Stonebrunt will be home
only to a handful of Druids and Necros, with a population way under what a
zone of that size could support.

|    To elaborate on the hunting: to get there, one must get through the King
|room in The Warrens, and out the back of the dungeon. Many classes will be
|unable to do this solo, period. And once the classes that CAN do it solo get
|into SB, they'll find a zone where half the hunting near zone was in camps
|that cannot be soloed, and the other half is the usual mixed bag of mobs
|with mobs blue to a level 42 wandering in the same spots as rabbits and
|spiritlings. No hunting unless you bring a group - which excludes most of
|the people in the damn game.

	Not putting a BIND POINT in Stonebrunt was the death blow for this zone.
A fighter who dies in Stonebrunt can't get back to his corpse alone, and
getting even a Revive will be difficult with the zone's level restrictions.

|    And farmers will love Snowbeast....

	Oh yeah.

|    Other tidbits from the zone: I completed one quest and heard the results
|of a second last night. The one I completed was Miranda's lost bag of dice,
|which drops in The Warrens off a level 18 mob (Lore, No Drop). The result
|was an all/all, zero weight, No Drop Ball of Yarn with 4 charges of snare,
|casting time 5 seconds or so.

	Cool, an item suitable for exactly no one.  If you have five seconds to
cast Snare, you didn't need a Snare....

|    The other quest done was the "kill the named kobold" quest. Apparently
|after killing a level 37 kobold the reward is a 6/24 one hander with 5 HPs
|and AC 2. Blech.

	Does not compare well to the Ranger's Short Sword of Morin, at least for
the Rangers.

|    Oh, and I haven't mentioned the broken scripting yet! Talk to Miranda, a
|little kitty, and she mentions how one of the elders gave her Chocolate
|Covered Cherries and Pixie Powder Cinnesticks. Well, even though Cinnamon
|Sticks have been unforagable since the patch that put Morning Dew on the
|forage table in GFay, I figured I'd still like to know the new recipes. So I
|asked the named elder about those two items. Both prompted her to tell me
|the sad tale of her people, just like her normal [bracket-encased text] did.
|BAH!

	Oh, I figured that was like the baked goods in Cabilis, they just TALK
about them with no new recipes.
