The article is talking about two separate games at once.  The Matrix Online is
out already. (1)  The as yet unnamed "DC Comics based" MMO is due Q4 2007 at
earliest.


(1) - And is apparently doing extremely poorly.  A CNN story noted The Matrix
Online has only sold 43,100 copies since its launch in late March.  About half
the sales of The Sims Online, which was considered a complete flop.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
