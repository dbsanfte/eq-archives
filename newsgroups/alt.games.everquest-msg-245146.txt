My Zerker is now 54 and wielding a War Marshall's Bladed Staff .. can I
suggest that a Weighty Polearm may be the best for you atm.  It is a
good damage ratio and is pretty cheap in bazaar ( well on my server ..
Bristlebane) anyway.  Give it a go.

I would also suggest that a lot of your Berserker questions may be
answered on this site:
http://www.goberserker.com/

Have fun .. this class is just begging to be finished.
