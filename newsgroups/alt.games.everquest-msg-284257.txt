Took me less than 2 weeks to get everything but the drop from emp ssra. 
Getting the drop from emperor ssra took over 4 months, a failed guild and a 
change of server, because another guild with a 6 hour time advantage decided

Nice to see that SOE have woken up to themselves and made personal flagging 
less of an issue. Good luck to them getting people to come back.
