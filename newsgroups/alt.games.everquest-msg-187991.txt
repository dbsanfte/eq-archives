    It's our hopeless moderate position. We aren't with the hawks in the
desert (although we do have ships there which will stay, and we do have a
small group of people doing surveillance which will stay), we aren't with
the doves in the UN (we have people there, we will go if the UN supports
it). We've always been like this, right in the middle. This is just one of
the first times that the hawks have been so hawkish, and the doves have been
so dovish, that we couldn't drag the two sides to somewhere in our middle
ground.

    He's Quebecois. If you'd ever heard how someone from France talks about
folks from Quebec, you'd know they aren't "French". Think about the way
people from the northern US talk about "white trash" from the South to get
an idea. Although some of them did try to skip out on World War II!

    So how's Blair? Has he started having hallucinations from lack of sleep
yet? ;-)
