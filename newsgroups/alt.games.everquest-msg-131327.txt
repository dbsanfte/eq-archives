I would seriously look at the eventviewer in administrative tools.  I was
getting strange disconnects/reboots and found two problems...the first was
autoenrollment a MS feature that I could care less about and the second was
EAPOL which is a wireless protocol that XP loads by default.  I disabled
both and am now no longer getting disconnected.  I play literally for hours
(which is another problem all together if you ask my wife).
