So with this partial information, I can at least compare:

Amplification lasts 8 tics.  So look at a 9 tic cycle

Cantana and leave it running  5 per or 45 mana
Cassindra's and leave it running 12 per or 108 mana
Amplified Cassindra's 18 per times 8/9ths or 144 mana

cantana chorus chorus repeat (5+17+17)*3= 117 mana
amp cantana chorus chorus cantana chorus chorus cantana chorus
0+5+23+23+5+23+23+5+23=130 first cycle, 135 subsequent cycles
It should be noted, however, that each of these cycles will
also produce between 36 and 144 hp (no idea what the
HP output of cantana is for my level)

I never use cantana as a rule.  Amped Hymn will produce
between 54 and 270 hp over a 9 tic cycle

Hmm, Amp hymn chorus chorus hymn chorus chorus hymn chorus
would produce 90 mana and keep HP output between 54
and 270.

Amp hymn cantana chorus chorus hymn cantana chorus hymn cantana
would produce

Hmm one other thing a relatively inattentive bard will often
do nine tics of chorus instead of 8, for a 10 tic cycle.

Over 90 tics, an optimally amped cycle will yield 1440 mana
while the 10 tic cycle will yeild... (144+12)*9=1404 mana
thats 97.5% efficiency and really quite a bit simpler, as the
bard amps, runs chorus till amp icon dissapears, and reamps,
instead of counting chorus tics so as to keep amp up
constantly.

For those keeping score at home, thats 1404 mana per 10 tic
cycle compared to the 1400 mana per 10 tic cycle of C3...
only it stacks, so you could have 2804 mana with both,
or

5 bards, C3, BAOR = 9000 mana per 90 tic cycle or
an average of 100 mana per tic.  Hmm, a bard could also
be stationed outside your group to add another 12 mana
per tic with his AOE song, and you could get those 5
bards to play -right- instead of sloppily for 10400 mana,
average 115 mana per tic.  Is there a class out there
capable of eating this much mana (on top of their meditation)
without drawing so much aggro they die?
 More than likely an optimal mix runs fewer bards and more casters.

4 bards C3 BAOR/POTG = 7416 on two casters, 14832 mana
3 bards same = 6012 on three casters 18036 mana
2 bards same = 4068 on 4 casters, 18432 mana
1 bard same = 2804 on 5 casters, 14020 mana

Interesting, this means the optimal mana group actually consists
of a pair of bards spreading mana over 4 casters.  And further,
those bards can be as low as level 32.  You can boost that by
another 1200  per caster by stationing a AOE bard outside the group

5 bards 10200
4 bards 17232
3 bards 21636
2 bards 23232
1 bard  20020
all in total mana per 90 tics

So the results, although even more amazing, are the same, best
total mana output comes from a 2 bard 4 caster group, in this
case with a 3rd bard (the only one who needs to be high level)
stationed  within AOE ranges.  Of course you can have several
similar bard caster clusters operating off that single AOE bard,
who might be best placed in the Melee group where his other
two songs per 3 tic cycle will be best used.
