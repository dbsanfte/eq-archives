Ok. First, let me say that I thoroughly belive people should use
discretion when begging for ports. That is to say FREE ports. I was
killed in Kithicor the other night (right at the WC zone - dang it
all). Luckily, I was bount in FP, but it was late and I really didn't
feel like making the trip back through the 2 zones to get there.
Therefore, before I set out I thought I'd take a chance. I /shouted
for a port for a CR - payment to be rendered upon CR. What the heck. I
was tired and had plenty of pp on my corpse. What's wrong with paying
for a service?

I could not believe the flaming I got. Well, I guess I CAN believe it.
Under slightly different circumstances, I would be among them flaming
a lazy beggar. However, I was not begging. I was willing to pay a good
price for the port and if I didn't get it, so what. I was going to
hoof it.

It's nobody's business if I'd rather pay for a port than walk
ANYWHERE. Usually I WOULD walk for that matter.  Some people need to
grow up and be a little less critical of others and a bit less quick
to jump up and cry foul.
