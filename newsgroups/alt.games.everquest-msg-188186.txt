I find myself swinging weapons when I'm grouped.  The songs I usually
twist during battle in a group are Amplification, Katta's, Haste song
(not the level 42 one) and Psalm of Warmth for a damage shield.  I'm a
level 43 bard.  On downtime I always twist the mana song with
amplication.  I'm pretty sure the haste and psalm are singing based
skills so that's why I primarily use my weapons when grouped.  Even
though it's only a little bit of damage (avg between 20-35 a hit) it
adds up.
 
I never melee when I'm soloing.  It's just not xp efficient.
I do so much more damage with my chants, selo's and Nostrolo's
tambourine than I ever could swinging weapons.  If I'm not chant
kiting I'm charm kiting.  I've never really cared for fear kiting all
that much.

> Bards 40> , what percentage of the time do you just play instruments?

All the time unless I'm grouped.  I'm probably grouped 30% of the
time.
