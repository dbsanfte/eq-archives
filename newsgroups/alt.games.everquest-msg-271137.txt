That is not true on every server. It isn't true on Stromm. Although I 
don't know this where I have no toons there, I would guess it isn't true 
on Morden Rasp. I hope FV is doing well as I want to make a toon there 
sometime but I don't know about that.

Your point is well taken though and it is distressing that I've been 
reading similar complaints from people playing on the older servers and 
yet I am not hearing SOE announce any plans to allow free transfers and 
consolidate the servers to eliminate this problem for their players.
