   This is an excellent suggestion.  It should be done.  The problem is,
I'm not willing to sink the time into doing it.

   *Gasp* You're willing?  It's yours!  Sounds like you have some good
ideas, and I'd like to see what you do with it.  You can use any of the the
HTML coding I've written, and I will help you in any way you like.

    Ya, I was nervous when I took it over too.  It's a pretty big project. 
Luckily, there are plenty of people who will help you with it.  I certainly
had to research/ask questions about much that is in there.  As for you only
playing 10 months, well, I happen to thing that is vastly preferable to
someone who isn't playing at all.  Sure, I did play for four years, but EQ
is now just a memory for me, and the reality of what is was versus the
reality of what it is evolving to changes more with each patch.  I can
sorta keep up to date by reading patch posts here, but that really isn't
nearly as good as actually playing the game, I think.  Plus, I am growing
more and more apathetic about investing chunks of time into EQ related
projects.  It would be an improvement were the FAQ reworked, and I know how
to and could do these changes, but I simply am not willing to do so.

   Before I took up the FAQ, it had lain abandoned for a long time.  It
mentioned Kunark and Velious, though in reality there were 7 expansions at
that time.  I thought, and still think, that this newsgroup does need an up
to date FAQ, and thus didn't just abandon it when I quit EQ.  But I think
it would be much, much better if an active, interested player were doing to
updating.

   So... enjoy, and let me know if I can do anything to help!
