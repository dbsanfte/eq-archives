As always, the most reliable way to loot those uncooperative mobs is to set
up a hotkey that does the following:

Line 1:  /tar a
Line 2: pause 3, /loot

That will generally work for just about any mob whose name starts with "a"
(as in "a vile stonemite"). You can also just type it manually, which is
what I usually do. Handy for things like those impossible to target
whirlwind things in LDoN.

Another trick is to keep in mind that your pet will retain the target of the
most recent thing he was fighting, and so if you had a pet attacking, simply
/assist him and then /loot.

I've had all sorts of other targeting problems. I can stand right in front
of the portal stone into KT and click it till my fingers are numb and not
get in. For some reason, every so often I will randomly get a click to land
and then I'm on my way. But it's very unreliable and makes you think twice
about treating any portal zoning device as a safety hatch in the event that
you've got train aggro.

Fortunately, the patch message suggests that this may have been addressed in
the current update. We'll see.
