I wanted to reach out to this group and see if any members would be
interested in this casting notice for MTV's "True Life."

True Life: I Live Another Life on the Web
We are currently producing a documentary for MTV about people who live
"other lives" online.

Do you sometimes feel as if you're living a double life? Are you
pretending to be someone you're not? Do you have one identity in your
everyday life, but a different one when you're alone and on-line? Does
your virtual avatar make you feel confident behind your computer
screen? Are you famous online but feel like you're invisible in real
life?

Do you have trouble approaching someone for a date in person, but when
you're behind the comfort of your computer, do the words just flow?
Would you be afraid to be yourself if you were ever to come face-to-
face with your online friends or companions? Do you get so caught up
in the person you pretend to be on the web that you maintain that
persona in person?

If you appear to be between the ages of 16 and 28, and live another
life on the web, email us at: brosen@leftright.tv with your story.

Please be sure to include your name, location, phone number and a
photo, if possible.

Thanks!
