No shit, Sherlock.   I never said I did.  In fact, I don't speak for
anyone but myself.

Yes, I also know many people, Canadian and otherwise, who feel that
way.  That does not mean I do not also know many Canadians who take
insult at being called "American".  I even know some who hold both
opinions, with are not mutually exclusive.

The word has two definitions,
(1) the USA, and
(2) the continents of North and South America combined.

I maintain that common usage is to follow definition 1, at least in
Canada and the US.  I don't personally care what you use, you may damn
any usage you want, just like you can choose to be belligerent about
this issue and pointlessly lengthen the thread.
