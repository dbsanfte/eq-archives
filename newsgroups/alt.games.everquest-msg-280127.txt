Nice idea. I wish someone had come up with this before I died a
bored-with-EQ permadeath. I canceled my accounts months ago; bit it's
this kind of thing that has the potential to bring me back. I'm
currently looking into Guild Wars (haven't purchased it yet, but I'm
hearing good reviews and there's no monthly fee). In EQ, I was a guild
officer who had a 65 Paladin with 150 AAs (couldn't bear the thought of
leveling him to 70 once that level came out), a 50 monk, a 50 druid, a
50 Ench, and a host of lower-level chars.

I will send you an email just to keep infomed about this, but I can't
yet commit to it. However, I do have some thoughts.

(1) For all those who want the conveniences of PoK, Bazaar, etc., I
think the point is to get back to the roots. What did we do before PoK
and Bazaar (I realize some of you might not be aware there was a time
before these things)? We relied on the gear we get from the mobs we
could hunt. That's pure. That's what made it so fun. Now the game's
been reduced to how few hours it takes a PL-er and Twinker to get to
level 70. To me, there's no point; but the pressure is high in the game
to conform or be left behind. I like the idea of tossing the "new
world" stuff.

(2) To prevent as much twinking as possible, I recommend the Firiona
Vie Roleplaying server. It allows only one character at a time per
account. Obviously you could have two accounts and therefore two chars
(and thereby have the opportunity to twink), but a server like FV
minimizes violations.

(3) Speaking of roleplaying, I rather like the idea of returning to a
roleplaying format, and I think this idea weds nicely with that.
There's just something about recognizing good vs evil (that's what the
game is based on, after all--talk about returning to roots!), and
aligning your character accordingly. This may go too far for many who
are on board for the first idea, but I think it's something to
consider. In any case, the core idea (apart from RPing) is a step in
the right direction.
