I'd look into what spells and what weapons each were using.  Ranger being 
my main, I know it's very easy for us to grab aggro, especially against a 
warrior with non-proccing weapons (we have a line of spells that adds a 
proc to our weapons) and really especially if we're snaring.  Likewise if 
the SK is casting darkness.

Warriors are the kings of damage mitigation, they are nowhere near being 
the kings of hate production without some serious weaponry.  What this 
means is that all the other members of the party need to be on good 
behaviour when a warrior is tanking (compared to, say, a paladin, where it 
takes a good chain proccing of call of fire for me to peel the mob off 
him).

If you have some cash lying around, you might want to look into getting 
some more damaging weapons, especially weapons that proc frequently.
