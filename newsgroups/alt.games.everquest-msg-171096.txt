As long as it was completely voluntary, I would love to see such a thing.
Not everyone would have to pray at each or any service, but they would have
to shut up and be respectful if they don't chose to participate.  It would
be a great way to foster understanding between the religions and break down
some of the prejudices.  Again, though, participation would have to be
strictly vountary.  I wonder if it would be considered a Social Studie's
credit.  Now, the only thing making it an issue is that seminary classes
aren't allowed on campus.  It's that whole freedom-from-religion thing.

Your entire rant falls apart for two reasons.  One, you're a jackass, plain
and simple.  Two, I have no problem with the free expression of religion,
even if it's not my own.
