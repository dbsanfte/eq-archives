For my money Beastlords are the best soloers bar none.  Admittedly Ive not
taken a necro up to a high level, but speaking as a 55 Druid, I can safely
say that my beasty has had a far easier time soloing than my druid at the
same level. Better yet, Beastlords are very welcome in groups, a benefit
that my Druid most definitely does NOT enjoy :)
