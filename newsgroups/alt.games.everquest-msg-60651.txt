I think both of these ideas are really interesting.  I guess it's a
testament to the complexity of the world we play in that it's hard to
predict the impact this sort of option would have over the long term.  But
if the choice were mine to make, I'd definitely give something like this a
try.

It's a lot easier to justify from an in-game perspective than Trivial Loot
Code.  I.e.  That monster was too easy for you to kill; it therefore didn't
actually have the magic sword you just saw it swinging at you.  In fact,
experience (and maybe buffs for small cash donations) seem like what a god
really might give someone for showing the strength of their devotion by
making these donations.  Same for the faction hit with NPCs.  I mean, if the
world is to be as realistic as possible, how could it *not* help your
standing with the Freeport Militia if you gave a guard at the gates
something better than he already had with which to defend the city?

I guess, like anything else, Verant would have to make a number of
adjustments to prevent abuse before they got it just about right, but I
think the rewards would be well worth the effort.
