And I predict that this will start to change.
Why!

Because it is hard for newbies to the game to group. At best it is
patchy getting a group, except in a few locations and these is just as
likely to be known for rudeness, kill stealing, camp crashing, etc (High
Keep Hold and Plaudal Cavers (sp?) for examples).

Yes folks, the game has changed from what it was four years ago. Best
example, all those guides that talk about how easy it is to loot quest
items way below the levels need to kill the mob, because the zone is
always crowded. Unfortunately, many of them aren't these days.

And why will SOE change it?
Because by making it easier to solo, they can keep more players.
