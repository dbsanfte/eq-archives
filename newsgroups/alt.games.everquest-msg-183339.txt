As Sparkup said, left click, hold, and when the desired button is on the
pointer, drag it to the desired hotkey.  You can move them between hotkeys
the same way.  Remember though, right clicking on a spell button makes it go
away.  That's a bad thing to have happen to your primary nuke in the middle
of combat.  DAMHIKT

Just curious, and no offense intended.  How do you get to level 39 and not
know this?  It's in the manual.  I'm always looking at the manual for some
little thing that can make the interface easier to use.

Now what would really help is if I could go to 1600 x 1200, but increase the
font size so I could still read the print on my 21" monitor.  The print is
too small at 1600 x 1200, so I use 1280 x 1024.  I know how to change
colors, but some of the blue text is always blue (such as /con blue), and
you can't read it against the grey/black background.  Nothing I do seems to
alter the background of the text boxes.

Cheers,
Eric
