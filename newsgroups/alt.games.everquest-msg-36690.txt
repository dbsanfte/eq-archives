This is odd to me. I have *never* had music in everquest, ever. I get
ordinary noises (casting, melee hitting etc), but no music/"jingles"
ever.

I used to think it was because of my old soundcard (awe64), but now I
have a SB live, and still no music. Although, apparently I'm not missing
much according to most people.
