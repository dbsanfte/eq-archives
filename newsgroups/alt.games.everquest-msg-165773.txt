    Back when we did Tunare, we lost more people to Ail than we did Tunare.
Consistently. Once you have her locked on one person (and with her being
perma-rooted, building one person to massive aggro isn't hard), she'll
actually summon that person back after a knockback. That nullifies the
knockback completely, and makes the fight pretty trivial to heal against.
She also doesn't move around, messing up positioning, like other mobs (Ail)
do. If you ever want a fight where the mob spins all over the place, pull
one of those 1 million HP brownie guys!
