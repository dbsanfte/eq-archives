Grouped fighting the gnolls/skellies in northern Lake Rathe (long time ago).

There's this monk that is not being all that useful, and keeps looting out
of turn. Finally, after I Lay the warnings on pretty thick, he loots the
next sell drop, and I punt him from the group.

He then proceeds to start threatening me with retribution from his high
level guild leader (What kind of retribution can you have on a non-pvp
server?), then warns me that I better let him in or he will use his monkish
powers to make my life miserable (that was the part I /report ed and
/petition ed).

He then proceeds to start doing the pull/feign at our feet thing. Poor sod.
He'd pull 5 mobs, I'd AE mez 4 of them. I kept thanking him for pulling for
us. He died twice (Mem breeze, wait for him to run in, cast breeze, he
feigns, breeze lands, breaks feign because he was standing when I started
casting).
He finally gets me and the group killed. I get three spammy tells from him
cheering my death, and when I reply he's not on. I begin my long run from
Qeynos (I did not know you could bind in Arena at the time, and this was
before you could bind in the Gypsy camp). So-and-so want's to rez you dialog
box pops up, I click ok.

I didn't notice the name or type of rez, really wasn't paying attention. I'd
have taken a 'get you back to your body' rez.

It was the server GM. He'd just punted the guy for training (suspended him a
week), and was nice enough to rez us back in as he hadn't arrived in time to
stop it, he had just seen it.

Lots of griefers in this game.
It's just the price you pay. At least it's not Shadowbane, where griefing is
called 'strategy'.
