Wow...  Nice.  See Linda, usually the way it works is...  Someone posts a
problem, like you did about not being able to log in...

The rest of us share our experiences such as "Yup, me too... can't get past Log
In Screen" or some such.  

Then, eventually someone over at Sony's end will post something explaining why,
yet again, we are unable to get into the game.  Someone here will eventually
find that message.  

That someone will then either post a link to that message or they will
copy/paste that message here so that everyone with this similar problem has
some understanding as to what is going on.  

Common courtesy.  To call someone an *asshole* because *you* acted in a
discourteous (incourteous?  LOL) manner is bad form. 

Andrew is not the only one who was put off by your whole 'nevermind I found it'
reply.  He just beat the rest of us to the keyboard.
