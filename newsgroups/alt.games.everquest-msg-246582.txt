New DX9 capable card I am afraid and unless you have super big bucks
for the new Nvidia card you are really looking at a Radeon.  You can
get a 9800 Pro very cheaply at the moment.

I suggest you do a Google search with the title "Nvidia DX9 problems"
have a look at the Inquirer article and others on the subject.  You
could shell out for the latest Nvidia card which does support DX9
properley at a cost of $US499.

Good luck.
