Which is still true, despite your flailing arguments to the

Go on, keep flailing.  It's amusing!  :)

I attempted to translate the comment into something more easily

you haven't the intellect to comprehend.

You're implying I don't think there's a difference between those

There's that "bitter ex-EQer" remark again, which I responded to
in my previous post, but you've conveniently snipped.  Don't you
have *anything* better than ad hominems and poor logic?

: wants to put in their mouths

I didn't put words into anyone's mouth.  You can keep saying I did,
but again: just because you keep saying it doesn't make it true.

The only bullshit around here is spewing from your mouth, Kaev.
Calling me a "bitter ex-EQer" when I've made it perfectly clear
I enjoyed playing EverQuest and left for a variety of reasons,
and certainly don't feel bitter.

Shame on you, you little troll.

: simply makes something obvious, that you are a
: bitter ex-EQer trolling this newsgroup, blindingly obvious.

And you're a wife beater.  Admit it, Kaev.  You're a wife beater.
It's blindingly obvious.  Surely you can't get all these angry,
abusive, aggressive feelings out through Usenet alone.

How long have you been beating your wife, anyway?

: Really?  You sure fooled me, what with this bitter and pathetic

: quitting.  You're oh-for-three here Ed.  You've struck out.

Again, you get the facts wrong.

I never announced I was quitting.  I announced that I *did* quit.
I attempted to inject humor into my announcement, and certainly
didn't complain about EverQuest or bash EverQuest in any way,
shape, or form in my "I quit" announcement.

I've repeatedly told you I enjoyed playing EverQuest, and offered
to give you a detailed reason why I left.  Of course, you didn't
take me up on that offer.  You prefer to continually declare I'm
a "bitter ex-EQer" without any facts.  Facts would turn your little
world upside down.

You see, Kaev, this is part of what makes you a dick.  Quit telling
people what they are and what they feel and what they mean, you wife
beater you.

-Ed
