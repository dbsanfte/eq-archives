The facts also say that using terrain is allowed.  E.g., put on levitate,
and run a mob over hilly terrain.  You'll pull ahead, because the mob has to
follow the terrain.

That's not an exploit: that is using terrain, and is a perfectly legal way
to kite if you are a levitating class without SOW.

Didn't Verant un-ban the people who were banned over the ST incident,
because Verant decided that it wasn't a clear exploit?  Verant then declared
that that particular use of that particular terrain was an exploit, so if
someone went in and used it now, they would be exploiting, but the original
guild that used it wasn't exploiting, because it was a logical use of the
terrain.
