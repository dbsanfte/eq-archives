So how are they dealing with name conflicts?

In DAoC, they've taken an interesting approach to this problem.  They 
are "clustering" servers.  They take two or three servers, and make it 
so that these servers share their frontiers, but they remain separate 
outside the frontiers.  There are NPCs that can port you between the 
non-frontier areas of the servers in the cluster, so you can visit the 
other servers in the cluster.  You cannot join a guild on another 
server, and I don't think you can buy housing in the housing zones from 
the other servers.

For name conflicts, people from other servers have "of Server" after 
their name, so if, say, Pellinor and Merlin were two servers in a 
cluster, and you are Soandso on Pellinor, and were standing next to 
Soandso from Merlin, people from Pellinor would see you as "Soandso" and 
see him as "Soandso of Merlin".  People from Merlin would see you as 
"Soandso of Pellinor" and their Soandso as just "Soandso".
