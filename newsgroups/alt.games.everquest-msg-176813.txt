Hmmm.  Technically I could marry a character on my other account, but
I'd have to create one on Test first, get _her_ to 20, then announce
that the Vah Shir custom is for husband's to take the wife's name,
etc.  Presumably the marriage would require the presence of a GM, so I
may as well just petition for it.  :)
