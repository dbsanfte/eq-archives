Yes, you are evil! (lol)

Actually, I believe only the first transfer was actually a true =
transgression of the EULA. As far as your daughter, I don't think she's =
even supposed to be playing at 9 yrs. old. Had she tried to sign up on =
her own and entered her birthdate, she would not have been granted an =
account because she is under 13 (?). I believe that transferring an =
account to a minor in your family does not violate the EULA.

Now, purists would say that you did in fact break the end-user agreement =
by giving the account to your girlfriend. Other may suggest that she =
should have set up the account with her personal and billing information =
and then let you level up her character. But then the purists would have =
pointed out that that would mean sharing the log-in name and password, =
which also breaks the EULA.

Finally, there are some here who will say that what you did doesn't =
amount to anything, but the fact that you posted this possibly =
controverial topic here was only done so to start (yet another) flame =
war. By "yet again", I do not mean that you personally have started =
other flaming threads, but that there have been an abundance of them =
lately.

Anyway, my thoughts on how you may have or may not have violated the =
EULA are mine, and mine alone. If I have interpreted the EULA =
incorrectly, please forgive me. In either case, I hope the three of you =
enjoy your new accounts.
