Which was it?  The one who sells spells has never given me a faction hit and
IIRC she's the only one who cons blue to me

As a monk, im notoriously bad for hitting random npc's that I shouldn't,
just "cuz they are there"
On Sunday, was in dawnshroud waiting to port to GD for the 10th ring war and
i was getting impatient (which happens after 5 seconds or so)   I'd conned
the guards when I first zoned in and they were blue, so I decide to attack
one.. of course it was an even con level 60 guard smacking the crap out of
me :)
