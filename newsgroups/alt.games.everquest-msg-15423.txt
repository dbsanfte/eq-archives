Up until recently, bards held a crippling xp penalty that made them
difficult to level.

Bards are EXCEEDINGLY difficult to play well, and played well, they are
murder on your finger joints.

Because bards are rare, there aren't many for people to see playing them
well, so people don't have a good idea of what bards can do. So they aren't
inclined to add a bard, and so bards are more likely to give up because
they can never find a group. Vicious circle.

However, bards have godlike power, especially if their computer/link allows
them to do effective twisting. I was grouped with a bard who somehow
managed to twist 4 1/2 songs, and it was incredible how much easier every
single fight was.
