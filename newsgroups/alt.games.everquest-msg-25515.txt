Im in the attemp of changing my first name as well thru a GM..but in the
mean time i need some help.  My first name right now is Casanoid.  Im a
Troll Shaman, and want a first and last name that will go with the idea that
i am the walking plague.  That i can disease and sicken the greatest.  At
least that is my mind set as i play in the game (roleplaying and all that)

Any help with a frist name, last name, or a combo of both together would be
great!

(by the way, i choose the troll male with green eyes, because of sickness
and all that stuff =p  )
