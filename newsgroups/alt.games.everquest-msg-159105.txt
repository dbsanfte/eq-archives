Not sure what your saying here...

I agro a mob, drag it to a kos-to-him mob... and then I FD?

If I dont FD, the mob is going to concentrate on me only until im off his
agro list.  If i do FD, I (theoretically) am now off the agro list.  He will
fight the kos mob.. and yes he will sumon the kos mob

Well yeah, but outside of GD I cant think of too many zones where you will
find kos/nonkos mobs to you, that also hate each other, and are of a level
range that your "friend" will die, and give you the easy kill of the baddie
