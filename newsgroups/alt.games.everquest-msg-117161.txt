My Druid moved to South Karana before the changes
in LoIO, so it didn't make much difference to him.

Lvl 16 warrior is having a hard time, even moving
around in Oasis, so I have to get her out of
there. 

Where do you think would be the best place to go,
bearing in mind I only play around 2-3 hrs a week,
although sometimes at the weekend, I may be on for
a reasonable time. I have got Luclin installed
now.
