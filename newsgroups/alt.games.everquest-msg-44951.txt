ok so pretty well everyone knows about that weird emote text spam that we
all had to put up with. i was grouping in OT last night and it seemed alot
worse in that zone for some reason. i just ignored it. but i noticed that
twice the gibberish had normal words in it. below is a copy of what i saw.
now those are names of people on TP i know about 5 or 6 of those names from
grouping with them and a couple are friends. some of those people where
online when it showed up, some of those people where offline. odd that the
game would start spitting out seemingly random player names
