   The "But what if?" part is what I am looking at here.  I don't think
that allergies to any sort of hot pepper are common.  Really.  I've never
heard or read of anyone that had one, and I just googled to see if I
could.  Yes, I'm sure it could happen.  But I am also reasonably sure that
the odds are extremely tiny that my food thief is deathly allergic to hot
peppers.  It is a chance I am willing to take.

    Also, I think the reason some think a food thief who takes steals food
when they have a severe allergic reaction  to some things is a candidate
for a Darwin Award is this.  Since they are taking food, they are taking
their chances that they will one day run across someone like me.  Someone
that has an intense dislike for being turned into a victim in any way or
form, no matter how trivial.  Someone who try to do something to dissuade
them from continuing this practice.  You can die from eating something that
the vast majority of people can survive eating?  Then you are taking your
own chances too.

  But how much does it cost for the tattoo on the forehead that reads
"Doormat"?
