Save 'em for a while.  You're going to need to research some of your
higher level spells, and the training points help get it up quickly.

Also, when you get your first familiar your conjuration skill will blow
chunks, and it might be nice to have a bunch of training points available.

For the most part, skills that you can train in that you need will go
up on their own.

On a regular server /role hides your level, class and race, but not your
guild, /anon hides everything including your guild.

As for roleplaying - well, that varies by person.  Mainly, be your wizard,
not Ray - don't talk about out of game stuff, maybe make up a quirk or two
and play them.  My mage had a long standing dislike of gnomes (they always
came off as superior) and was delighted to meet my beastlord who has never
met a gnome he didn't like - for dinner that is.
