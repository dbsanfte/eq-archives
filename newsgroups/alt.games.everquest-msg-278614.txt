The problem I had with WoW wasn't with the gameplay, in all honesty.
It was the community and the devs with heads up their asses. Watching
Caydiem busting her ass trying to squeeze a shred of info out of the
devs to give the players and not getting anywhere was just depressing.
Especially since most of the forum goers blamed HER for the devs'
incompetence. The general player base was pretty much what you expect
to see on Battle.net. There were some good players, but they were far
overshadowed by the morons.

Lack of RP even on the RP servers was another big killer for me, but
that's just me. For me, I have to be able to find a good RP group in
an MMO to keep playing for long. The best I could find on Cenarian
Circle was an "RP-lite" guild for whom RP was mostly some semi-IC
chatter during raids and over the channels. Character/storyline based
RP was rare at best.
