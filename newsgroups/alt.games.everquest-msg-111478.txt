No, they're selling access to the servers which are property of
Verant/Sony. Yes, this is done via knowledge of the login info, but I
can't go around selling passcodes to the doors at work and get off by
saying "I'm just selling my knowledge of these numbers".

Your use of the vehicle is on your own resources, not the dealer's.
You pay for gas and maintaining the vehicle. In the case of EQ
accounts, Sony pays for the electricity running the servers and for
upkeep on them. 

A more accurate comparison would be renting a house and then leasing
out rooms without clearing it with the landlord first. YOu better
beleive the landlord can kick your sappy ass out on the streets for it
even if the lease doesn't expressly forbid it.
