That's it I've had it with SOE, always patching on my days off, or worse
always changing the good parts and destroying something we get used to,

I cannot believe this new casino, it's so hard to win anything good, on top
of that after three days of play I've discovered it's rigged to win a gold
tickets.

At almost the exact same time three days running one or more people won a
gold ticket, it happens what would appear to be three times a day maybe
four, between 6 - 7 AM EST for sure is one time, also around 3 PM EST & I
believe 8 PM.

I've asked others who won their tickets the times and including one win of
mine this seems to be fact, which also leads me to believe it's not random
at those times but a GM or Guide are issuing the Gold Tickets, that's not
gambling but playing god,  weekends seem to be total random times if at all.

I've dropped over 800k and only have a DE Illusion Mask to show for it,
everything else like the stat food and and fireworks and small prizes like
poison bolt gloves that don't cast any more damage than if I was to run up
and kick something in the butt.

Ultimately I was trying to win a Glowing Drum which cannot be dropped or
bought anywhere, this just stinks to think for 800k I could have bought
seven of the finest drogs  or horses for all my alts which could use them,
but I cannot even get one special one for one alt.

Anyway I'm selling off everything I have that's not no drop from all my alts
and gambling it away, win or lose a glowing drog I will then be rid of EQ
forever because I intend to delete all my characters across three accounts
and say good riddens to their corrupt gaming society.

I then intend to start playing anything and everything but MMORPG's and
nothing with Sony on it because SOE has left a bad taste in my mouth for
life.

That's my rant so like it or not screw SOE and I hope they all choke on
their dinner tonight.

the end
