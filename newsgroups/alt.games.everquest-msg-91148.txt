If the haste is a proc, you could wait till it procs then swap to
weapon(s) with a superior ratio.  (E.g. proc an Exe Axe than switch to
a couple of fast one-handers).

If it's a permanent effect, it's less obvious, but in the case of the
Mith 2H at least, you get the damage bonus of a delay 40 weapon, but
swinging noticeably faster.  Makes the Mith 2H one of the few old-world
weapons which still has some worth (at lower levels, anyway).

None that I can think of :)  Other than the FBSS, two obtainable belts
which spring to mind (but you'll need a mid 50's group for each) are
the Sash of the Dragonborn from HS and the Silvery Belt of Contention
from Kael.
