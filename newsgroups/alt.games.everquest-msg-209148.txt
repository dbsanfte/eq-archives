from what I understand and from personal experience you can use the key that
comes with the game and add it to your account and it will unlock the
expansions. So it can be used as a new game or a back patch. I know people
who still to this day do not have Kunark but have Velious and POP and SOL so
they could use this to get Kunark and LOY.
