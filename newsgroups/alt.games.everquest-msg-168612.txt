Chanters solo extremely well in some situations. There raid utility is very
low since a single chanter can do ALL of the chanter stuff needed in a 48
man raid most places.

Chanters can easily fill in the slowing role . 70% vs 75% makes a diffrence
but it is livable. A good bard can easily fill the crowd control role.

Monks where slightly underpowered pre nerf. Now they are useless. Reduced
dependence on gear is laughable. Feign pulling is an art but one that is
very infrequently actually needed. There are also several other classes that
can do it (and why the hell did they give bards feign?)

I know several rogues that wonder why you think they cannot solo. One of
them soloed to 60.
There group dammage is really obscene and there are MANY places that
absolutely require a rogue to get to or survive at.

The paladin spell line is drastically underpowered.  Paladins should have
80% of the combat ability of a warrior (with the same offense defense type).
They should also have 60% of the full spell line of a cleric. A 65 paladin
should certainly have cheal ( a 39 spell) to just name one . They should
also have a similiar range of cleric fears, nukes, and roots.
