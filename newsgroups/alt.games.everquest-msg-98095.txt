Well said! I wonder how many poor, lifeless souls actually grasp the
realms of Norrath as a more or less real life, and when the servers
are down are forced to retreat to the game of eat sleep and work (last

Personally, I enjoy incredible moments with EQ; and sometimes despise
those that inhabit the fantasy as creatures of demerit...

BUT, tis only a game, with the upmost of simple escape mechanisms :
the /camp desktop hotkey. Wish I had something to that effect for the
highly stressed RL events that occur! hehe
