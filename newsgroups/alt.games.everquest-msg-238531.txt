zlandicar's heart, on my necro twink - I took this thing for granted, until
I sold it, and realized what a huge difference it made in hp and the mana
used to heal myself!!!!

when stonebrunt and warrens came out, I rushed in to get some authentic
Japanese weapons - Bronze Wakizashis looked uber dual wielded!!!!  Too bad
Wak of frozen skies graphic sucked.

the first piece of high elf cultural plate that I made!!  Several guildmates
helped support my smithing career, with pp and farming, and I eventually
outfitted all our elven int casters and druids with the imbued caster chain,
and our high elf clerics and pallys with imbued plate!

Obsidian shard - my first ever weapon with a PROC!!! a sucky one, but it
PROCCED!!!!!!
