This statement took me back to my military days.... Each division of the
armed forces think they are the best...
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, etc....
    While I was in the Army, my personal stance was not that we were any
better, but that we were a very important part of the machine. Just like
each division of the military...
    This is the same with EQ..   there are various skills of the classes and
many overlay others... Bards, Druid, Chanters  (I think all can charm and
mez(I did say think))  But most have their speialty.
    I agree with you, many dont get it......

Agreed, if he left me down there... I would defintly return the favor by
passing the info to guildies and any other passerbys....
