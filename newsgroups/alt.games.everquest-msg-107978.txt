The GeForce 4 ti4400 has performed flawlessly for me so far.  The true 
GeForce 4 cards (ti4200, ti440, ti4600) perform very, very well on the 
benchmarks, and are giving very good performance in game.  They are pricy, 
but if you're looking for a high-end card, they are a very strong choice.

Don't be confused by the GeForce4 MX series though.  They are basically 
just upgraded GeForce2 MX chips, and the cards are less powerful than 
GeForce 3 cards.
/rude nVidia for confusing product nomenclature
