Bizbee didn't claim that he was still playing EQ, but that EQ still has 
a grip on him. This is undeniable, if he's still visiting the newsgroup.

Having said that, the same is true of me. I haven't logged in in weeks, 
but I still read this NG religiously. That arguing about the game is 
more entertaining than playing it is something that has been true for me 
  pretty much since day one.
