Don't believe me?  Make a SK or Paladin.  Dwarf, Ogre, Troll and jack
up stamina.  Then make a dark elf warrior and do not add anything to
stamina.  The SK or Pal starts with about 30% more hp's than a
warrior!!  And hp's are gained at each level using formula starting
level hp's - 5 per level.   Does this make any sense?  The developers
of EQ say warriors have the most hp's but they do not.  Say it is the
stamina?  Make any small race warrior and this time put all 25 bonus
points into STA the warrior still has less hp's than a starting
Ogre/Troll/Dwarf Knight.  Say it isn't so.... but it is.
