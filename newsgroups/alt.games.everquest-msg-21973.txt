I was one of the group that was there petitioning the GM to set us up. It is a
guild that only permits evil races and was quite a sight to see a dozen Dark
Elves standing around EC. It gets created and im invited..great! its a guild
for low level characters and the moto speaks of the superitoy of the evil races
and hatred of everybody else. But, im not sure how credible this moto is as i
was out hunting bears with the leader and a couple of other guild mates and we
looted a HQ pelt. the leader shouts if theres a buyer and ends up selling the
thing to a High Elf! Am i just splitting hairs over this? because to me it
seems a bit wrong to be trading and bowing with what should be our enemies? Im
not big into roleplay but i think a little would definately improve the game
and would rather find a fellow evil doer to trade with and tell the pinkie to
get stuffed. In the spirit of my neriakian i challenged an elven warrior, way
higher than me to a duel because he waltzed into neriak and started killing the
guards, sure i would have been killed but i cant just walk past Elf scum that
are invading my home city. Im thinking of quitting the guild but wonder whether
im overreacting a bit and shouldnt sweat the little things? Do any guilds pay
more attention to their moto's?
