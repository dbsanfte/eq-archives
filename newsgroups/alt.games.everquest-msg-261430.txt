But there is no point to experiencing it. Its not that you need uber 
stuff to go there. Its that you already have uber stuff when you get 
there (at least relative to what you are going to get from the zone)... 
and if you did go there the xp is slower and virtually no chance of 
anything dropping worth having... so you don't go at all.

And then there is no point to the content even existing because nobody 
uses it.

I agree. Its probably too late to revitalize the mid level game and mid 
level zones in EQ. The PLing/grinding and twink/shop itemization at that 
level range really can't be fixed without major overhauls to how 
advancement in the game works. Its not going to happen.

And that is why I'm watching WoW, EQ2, Vangaurd... I'll leave EQ as soon 
as a 'better' title rolls along. (OK... I'll wait for the first 
expansion/or 6-8 months after that, I have no desire to play a game on 
release with its lag, bugs, overcrowded newbie areas, and minimal 
content.)
