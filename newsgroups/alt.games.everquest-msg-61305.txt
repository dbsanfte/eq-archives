I didn't get too far...got bored, actually. :)

If you're saying that tradeskills are a time and money waster so they need
to be changed, well, ok.  Although I agree that they're time & money wasters
(you do them to have fun, that's all) and it'd be NICE if they were changed
so that they were actually USEFUL (money makers), I don't see it happening
so feel free to bitch if you want, but don't hold your breath. :)
