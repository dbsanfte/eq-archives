  Took me about 2 hours to patch everything and get SoL up and running.
  When you encounter hung files, ctrl-alt-delete out and kill both the
  patching process and the everquest process.  Relaunch until you get
  the file(s) to download, ctrl-alt-deleting and killing each time the
  download hangs.  You'll obviously be doing this quite a bit, but 2 hours
  of this isn't so bad when you read what others are going through.

  BTW: I'm running off a cable modem.  If you have dial-up just keep the
  No-Doze handy ;-)
