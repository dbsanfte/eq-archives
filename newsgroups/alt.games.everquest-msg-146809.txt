> Halfling with SOW potions wondering if its worth it to buy a horse?

There's no way for us to answer that question for you.  We aren't mind
readers, we don't know what you value as most and least important.

The main advantage is that you med at all times when you're on a horse, even
if you're running.

The main disadvantage, if you're not rich, is the cost.
The main disadvantage, if you ARE rich, is that you can't summon a horse
indoors.  Like the bard happy-feet song, once you zone into a dungeon you
can no longer run fast, unlike SoW which at may stay with you for as much as
36 minutes after you enter an indoor zone.
