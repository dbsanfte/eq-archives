Say, as an experiment, VI put high level fighters in loads of zones.
They wouldn't follow you around because you couldn't get exp with them,
but if you got into trouble, you could run to them and have them tank
for you. They'd kill the mobs real quick, and you would be less likely
to die. They could put them somewhere convenient, say outside towns, and
make them fight for FREE!

Maybe they could call them 'Guards' or something?

Nah, would never fly. Me and my crazy ideas...
