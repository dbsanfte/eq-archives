I once encountered an idiot in Oasis who claimed all the Spectres
on the island.  That might have been acceptable if he had been keeping
it all clear and attacking each new Spectre as it spawned, but in
fact he was sitting on the lake shore with his group, pulling one
every once in a while, leaving 5 or so Spectres always spawned.

I pulled and fear-kited a few (Paladin-style), and he purposely
came running over to KS them from me (Enchanter, no way I could
prevent it).  I asked him WTF he thought he was doing, and he
said that he was pissed because I was pulling "his" Spectres.
I pointed out there were plenty left on the island, but he
didn't find that relevant.

So next pull I grabbed two Spectres, ran them over to him while
he was fighting one himself, and asked, "if they're all yours,
do you want these too?"  The funny thing was that if he had
just ignored me, my two Spectres would have just kept beating
on me and left him alone, but as I expected the guy was stupid
enough to panic and start flinging spells on them.  Now they
really *were* his Spectres...

He managed to survive with the help of his group, just barely.

He then started screeching to the zone about how I had
"trained" him, but after I explained that it wouldn't have
happened if he hadn't tried to take *all* the Spectres in
sight, it was amazing how he left me and my pulls alone
after that.
