Only have the driver date sorry: 01/08/2001 (dd/mm/yyyy) as believe it or
not it worked straight out of the box with the drivers off the driver CD,
and I am a bit of a "if it ain't broke don't fix it" person.

Of note that also contrary to correct practice I did not reinstall the
Audigy drivers after installing DirectX 8.1 which is meant to be the correct
thing to do. (Did it with the Graphics card though of course).

EAX works fine outside of EQ, I have fun with all the affects and settings
on occasion, whether it works inside of EQ it's hard to tell, the sound is
pretty basic in EQ. I get no glitches whatsoever apart from playing around
with those directx commands within EQ to play external CD's and MP3's.
Whenever I moved and caused graphical load the music would skip.

Music within EQ? EQ has music? Hmmn - it's normally the first thing I turn
off in any game - not sure of that one.

What may or may not be of note is I am using purely digital speakers - no
analogue aspect to them at all. They are a 4 satellite and a sub setup,
listed as a 4 speaker setup within the Audigy control panel. The speakers
are Boston Acoustic BA7500G so the 5th channel for Bass is virtual, not o/p
from the card.

The only problem I encountered speakerwise was the digital o/p from the
Audigy was by default  twice the frequency that the speakers could handle
and had to be halved (easy enough settings wise but took a lot of trial and
error finding) or else all I got was massive speaker overdrive or nothing,
which was great for scaring the cat BTW : )
