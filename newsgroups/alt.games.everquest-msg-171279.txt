62+ mages can summon a Talisman of Return (if they have the spell) which is
a right-click gate, but they're not very good. To cast the gate requires a
alchemy made component, that costs about 100pp. The gate takes a long time
to cast, so you wouldnt be able to use it to get out of any emergencies. The
chances of finding a mage to summon you the item, and a shaman to make you
the component, is much less than the chance of finding a wizard to TL you...
