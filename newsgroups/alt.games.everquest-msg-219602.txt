    You might just be being sarcastic here, but I will take this at face value.

    If animals are not neutered, they produce more animals.  There is an
oversupply of cats and dogs in this country right now.  The extras are  killed
at animals shelters if they lucky, otherwise abandoned and left to die of
starvation, disease, attacks by other animals or sadists with bb guns rifles, or
exposure if not.  I suppose some might survive happily in a feral state, but
that is not how it often appears to go.  Only a very small faction of these
extra pets get adopted and given the status of pet.  Most are just hanging on,
barely, or dying.

   There were feral cats on this property we bought when we moved in.  If anyone
wants, I can post the story I wrote about Gem, feral cat we adopted and the
adventures we had with the cats (I posted it in a couple of different venues,
but not here, since I felt it was pretty far off topic).

   In one part of the post I describe the conditions Gem was in when we caught
her.  She was about 8 weeks old, and weighed less than a pound.  You could feel
every bone, each vertebrae and rib standing out in painful relief.  She had a
deep hole in her snout that the vet says was probably from some sort of
infection.  She has a herpes infection in her chest that settled in so hard she
will most likely have it for the rest of her life.  The vet says it is unlikely
that she would have lasted more than a day or two longer if we had not caught
her and intervened.  We couldn't catch the other two kittens that we know were a
part of her litter.  We never saw them after we saved Gem.  The vet is pretty
confident that they must have died.

   So please explain to me how allowing a surplus of animals to be produces,
most of whom will die painful death, more responsible than heading off the
problem by neutering one's pets.
