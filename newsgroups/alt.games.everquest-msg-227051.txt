What's the easiest way to build mele skills?  I took my 7 Ogre Warrior
to Unrest last night and grouped with a 10 bard.  A high level druid
came by and kept casting thorns on us while healing... The bard would
basically train the whole zone while swarms of mobs killed themselves
on the DS and he played an AOE so we'd get exp... needless to say, I
got to 15 in about an hour and a half but now find that my mele skills
suck and I can hardly hit mobs at my level.   So, could I just use a
sucky weapon and just beat on mobs forever?  Any other suggestions?

Thanks
