You're quite right of course - at least some of the GMs may start to
spot the Tolkien names after Christmas, when the film come out...

(hey, this is the nation for whom they changed the name of 'The Madness

the first two...)

Maybe Gnasher Furgutt's creator was a Beano fan, though?

/ooc Starting guild 'The Bash Street Kids', first 10 people to join can
