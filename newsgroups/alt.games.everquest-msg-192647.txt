Dakthin 38 Cleric.... I also started playing in January. Difference being
at about day 3, when I realised I didnt know what the hell I was doing, I
went and used google and I read and I read and I read and I read.......

Next time you dont know something go research it on the web first....
chances are thats all the person answering your question has done.
