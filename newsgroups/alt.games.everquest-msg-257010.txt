yes, Graeme's list shows them all at 119

Oddly his list shows these all at 75, although the list I'm using shows 
Fear at 100... disagree's with the list I have.

Thanks, that filled in all the blanks, can't tell which if either list 
is accurate but the two seem to agree in almost every spot.

The Hot Spot zones are supposed to have higher ZEM's at the moment and 
be subject to change, I think all the LOY zones are hot spots

Of course ZEM isn't the final arbitrar of which zones are the best exp 
per hour, because the exp per mob part of the equation is based on mob 
level, not on mob difficulty, so if killing a level 50 mob takes you 2 
minutes in a zone with a 75 ZEM and 4 minutes in a zone with a 150 ZEM 
the two zones end up the same in terms of exp per hour.

Still, its interesting to be able to compare ZEMs
