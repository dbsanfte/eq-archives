My 45 druid will play cleric, but keep in mind that she can't rez.  Having your
main tank bound 2 zones away from where you are playing, (if you're lucky)
running naked through Lesser Fay to Mistmoore without a sow is ... inefficient,
deadly, embarassing.... 
(You could bind melees in GF but no one ever seems interested in doing that).
