Coincidently, I was playing with this last night. It would not work for me.
The command when entered correctly gave no results. When entered incorrectly
it returned a help message. I'm in 800x600 full screen mode running a
GeForce2 graphics card and do not have the Velious expansion, only Kunark.

Any ideas?

Editing the eqclient.ini file directly did work.
