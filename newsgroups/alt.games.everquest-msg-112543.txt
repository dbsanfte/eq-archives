On Veeshan it would have to be Fires of Heaven (www.fohguild.org).  They
have strick requirements last time I was looking such as you must raid 5 out
of 7 days a week, must be level 60 and almost all classes had to have like
12 points into AA for consideration.  Most most other guilds can acomplish
with lets say 4 groups, they can do with 2.

These are some serious addicts here =P
