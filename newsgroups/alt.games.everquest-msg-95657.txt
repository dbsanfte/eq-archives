Hi all,

   I've been playing for over a year, and have several characters, one
at 52.  I think I understand faction.  Last night, things got very
weird for my 13 human warrior alt in BB.

   To explain, this guy has never left the vicinity of Freeport
before; having gotten to 13 killing the usual suspects in EC, WC, and
N Ro.  He's a simpleminded, swordswinging Human warrior.  Night before
last, he took
a crazy desire to go to the moon, on some vague rumor that hunting was
good in Paludal Caverns.  After an arduous journey, he found
everything there red as can be, did not kill anything, zoned twice to
avoid death, so decided to return to his familar hunting grounds. Took
the port back down to Gfay, ran to the BB docks, past the guards
without incident, and found the boat not there; so practiced some
swimming.  Did not attack or fight with anything. About 15 minutes
into the wait, while he was running up the dock for another dive:

[Mon Mar 11 21:25:56 2002] Balen Kalgunn says 'Guards!! Guards!! '
[Mon Mar 11 21:25:56 2002] Balen Kalgunn says 'Guards!! Guards!! '
[Mon Mar 11 21:25:58 2002] Balen Kalgunn slashes YOU for 81 points of
damage.
           [Ugly nasty things snipped]
[Mon Mar 11 21:25:58 2002] You have been slain by Balen Kalgunn!
[Mon Mar 11 21:26:00 2002] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

What the hell?  So, I contact a dwarf cleric friend who kindly gives
me a rez, and as I start to loot the body:

[Mon Mar 11 22:43:09 2002] Balen Kalgunn says 'Guards!! Guards!! '
           [Ugly nasty things snipped]
[Mon Mar 11 22:43:16 2002] You have been slain by Balen Kalgunn!
[Mon Mar 11 22:43:18 2002] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

...My friend kills Balen, and rezzes me again.  Since she's loaded
with cash, we decide to run back to the ring to port back to WC; and
as I pass the guards:

[Mon Mar 11 22:48:56 2002] Guard Clendin says 'For the glory of
Kaladim, have at thee!! '
[Mon Mar 11 22:48:56 2002] Guard Dunil says 'For the glory of Kaladim,
have at thee!! '
              [Truly ugly, vicious killing snipped]
[Mon Mar 11 22:49:02 2002] You have been slain by Guard Dunil!
[Mon Mar 11 22:49:04 2002] Returning to home point, please wait...
[Mon Mar 11 22:49:04 2002] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
 
...After a 3rd rez, safely back at the rings, I go to the crossroads
and con the guards -- they now Glower Threateningly.

...What has happened?  I keep a log file.  I scanned it for faction
hits to Storm Guards, Guardians of the Vale, and Storm Keepers -- the
only faction hits in the entire thing are Guardians of the Vale
getting better every time I killed an orc in EC.

   I ran around and hacked down about 20 goblins, and went back and
conned again -- still KOS!!

   Are humans now KOS to the guards by default???  What could have
happened to my faction?  I ran past the guards to get to the docks and
they didn't attack me, nor did that Kalun fellow the first 10 times I
ran past him swimming while waiting for the boat.  I didn't fight or
even touch anything in the meantime.  Anyone have any ideas??  Could
any equipment that you wear make you KOS??

   Thanks for any input.
