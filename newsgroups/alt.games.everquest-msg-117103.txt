Re suicide etc.

A quick check shows global suicide rates at 16/100000/year
http://www.befrienders.org/info/statistics.htm

The samaritens in the UK shows a lower figure (10 - 12)
But does note that 75% of suicides are male.
http://www.samaritans.org.uk/know/statistics_suicide.html

There are what 400k subscribers to EQ. (?)
And eq has been going about 3 year (?)

This means that you would expect between 120 and 192 suicides from EQ
players during the time it has been running.
If you take into account the fact that more EQ players are male than
female the expected number could be higher.

I have only heard of 2 cases of EQ involved sucicide.
While this does not prove that there have not been 200+  I find it
surprising that there are not more publicised cases.

I would (totatl guess) estimate that EQ actually decreases the risk of
suicide.
