If the FAQ leaves you with more questions, ask them; maybe they'll
go into the FAQ!

The section on pulling does say it involves going out and finding
things for the group to kill.  I guess it should explicitly say that
you bring them back (i.e., pull them to the group), instead of leading
the group to the mob.  I'll see about adding a few words before posting
the FAQ this month.

The FAQ does also mention various of the tools that some classes have
for pulling, especially feign death and pacify.

But what you went on to describe is, as Graeme noted, more kiting than
pulling.  Or rather, you began with a pull, which was tagging one mob
so it would follow you.  Then you stayed out of its reach while throwing
more ranged attacks at it.  That part is kiting.  The "pull" part is
that you pulled it away from where it was, so that other nearby mobs
didn't get involved in the fight.

Oh, and the "walking backwards" part you mentioned is mostly not part
of pulling.  If you're really pulling, you're trying to get the mob to
a place where it's safe to fight it (in a group, that means bringing it
to the rest of the group), and you want to move quickly to get there
ahead of the mob, so you just run and expect the mob to show up.  (Of
course, I speak from the standpoint of someone who can't "snare", so I
can't run backward fast enough to stay well ahead.  Instead, I have
hotkeys set up to switch quickly among different camera views so I can
glance behind me without giving up speed.)  You DO want to look and see
what's following you, because you need to know if any extra mobs are
coming with the one you wanted.
