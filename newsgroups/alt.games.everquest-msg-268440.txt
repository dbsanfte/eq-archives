    I'm pushing for the below 40% part to be axed. We're on officer 
decision, there's no reason to tie the officers' hands as to who they can 
and cannot award loot. If they like, they can decide amongst themselves that 
they won't award to anyone below 40% except in special circumstances, but 
there's no need for a formal rule that puts a big "PROBATION" stamp on guild 
members. The 20%, though, I support. You can't babysit people through 
content above their gear level forever, and you can't give the people who 
show up the least the most loot per time spent playing without pissing off 
the people who really support the guild. It's easier to axe people who are 
below 20% for three consecutive months (our full policy) than hope they get 
back to full time and keep them up to speed in the meanwhile.

    James
