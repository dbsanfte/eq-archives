You seem to have an axe to grind about powerleveling.  Who cares if he's
being powerleveled?  And he's not really being powerleveled as firstly he
needs to be of the appropriate level to be there, secondly he is high enough
level to be grouped with them and get xp while all other group members are
still receiving xp (Verant defined this range of levels, not him), and
thirdly he is contributing to the group in some fashion.  That's not being
powerleveled.  Recently I (54th mage) was grouped with a guildmate (61st
level druid) in the plane of Nightmare, the druid would charm a blood raven
(damn thing quads for 250).  My pet basically did damage but not really a
whole lot and there wasn't a whole lot that I was contributing.  By your
definition I was being powerleveled.  Sorry, but that's just not the case.
I wasn't contributing a lot, but I was contributing "something".  There were
times when I saved our collective butts too, when his pet became uncharmed
and using my pet and DD's I was able to finish off what we were fighting.
