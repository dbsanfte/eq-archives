For grins, one group of us tried him out, knowing nothing about him 
except that he hit me for 1550 max at the time, and he had not AoEed me, 
and he did banish me to the center of the lava lake.  So. we decided what 
the heck.  Cleric actually made it out alive, rest of us died fairly 
quickly.  His hp regen is pretty high, and we did find out about the 1500 
AoE.  The MA got ported to at least 3 different spots in the lava lake.  
We never got him even close to 75%.
