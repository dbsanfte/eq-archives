Actually, there have been plenty of weapons with broken procs, zero charges,
or charged versions of what should be a proc, etc, that have required handing
in to a GM for a new version. 

I dont know if anyone archives the patch messages but I am sure a dejanews
search on this group would enlighten you.

Of course, there have also been retroactive stats changes, such as the
buffing of certain 2h weapons.

I suspect where the issue is to do with a spell linkage their database isnt
sufficiently flexible to allow a retroactive change, or somesuch problem.
