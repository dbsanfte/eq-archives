Standard Wolf Form gives infravision... If Greater gave Ultravision,
that would be something. :)

Too many assumptions there... I don't even keep SoW memorized. My
line-up is:

Careless Lightning
Ensnare
Ensnaring Roots (or whatever the current root is)
Creeping Crud
Immolate
Greater Healing
Gate
Spirit of Cheetah

Although considering the number of times SoC has saved my life since I
got it (all of one, I think), I'm considering replacing it with another
one, maybe a second nuke.
