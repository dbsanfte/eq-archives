The "game" is the one where you keep digging at any little mistake
anyone makes. Popping up in threads out of nowhere to take a jab at it
whenever the opportunity arises. An obsessive drive to work at that
flaw trying to break the person down.

It's sad that you obviously think so little of yourself that you gotta
try to break others down so you can feel better about who you are.

Deny it all you want. Doesn't change a thing.

As for the matter at hand, I've never seen anything in the information
guides are given to indicate that the GMs can insert themselves into
guilds. Nor have I seen any evidence from those that insist they can
other than "I saw it happen once". Tell me, now, Biz, how is their
lack of evidence any less a problem for you than mine? Because their
side happens to concur with yours?

Really, life's too short for these obsessive crusades of yours. Find
something better to do...
