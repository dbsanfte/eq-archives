Not correct, im running a 9700 pro which is dx9 capable and i have the fog 
issue, my nephew has a x800xt which he just got 1 week ago, and he also has 
the fog issue, and my friend who plays has a 5900 (he also tried his 4200) 
........also with the fog problem.  Its related to the patch they did on the 
8/11 and it should be resolved at a later date.

Is this only since the new patch? i had used 4xAA in the past with my 9700 
pro and everything was fine, but i havent tried it with the new patch as i 
got sick of changing the AA between EQ and other directx games.
