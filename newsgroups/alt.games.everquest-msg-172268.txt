i am sure Everquest's Euro servers are about as steady as any other, and
that is pretty stable.

How about the game play?  Very excellent, never ending content. a little
hard for the casual gamer, but not too bad untill 45+


Are the controls easy to master?  Yes.

Can you use the mouse to control the direction you
> move?  Yes.

 Are players tolerant of new players to the realm? Yes, we love newbies, for
the most part as long as they dont go round begging  for money and/or items.

special Servers for PvP, and there are also arena's within most  cities in
which one can PvP.

How does it

on the pvp servers they tend to be kind of loose, but will crack down if
someone is ruining peoples gameplay by repeatedly killing them, camping
their corpses etc. but i could be wrong i never got too high on a PvP
server.
