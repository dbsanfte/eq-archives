Yes, I was very happy with my inexpensive labtec headset with
NCAT.  My buddy's GF was worried about us being able to hear her
if she came in, but we can't even hear him if he moves the mic
away from the corner of his mouth for a bong hit.

I run the client on a separate machine than EQ, so a Mono headset
is perfect - I can hear both of my EQ machines easily and still
hear everyone as clear as a bell.  Also, the voice quality is very
nice.  Not bad for $7 a piece with free shipping :)  Got some
for my buddies too.
