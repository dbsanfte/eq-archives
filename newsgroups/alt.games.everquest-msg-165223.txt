Do you?

How exactly do the Opium Wars figure in the point
you are trying to make?

This is from www.columbia.edu

"The trade took an ugly turn in the early 1800's.
British merchants began carrying opium to China,
and many Americans followed suit. Opium, a drug,
created its own demand by making addicts of its
users. U.S. merchants found they could buy a pound
of opium in Turkey for $2.50 and sell it in Canton
for $10.00."

This is from a more biased site;

The "Treaty of Wanghia" was the first unequal
treaty signed as a result of U.S. aggression
against China. The United States, taking advantage
of China's defeat in the Opium War, compelled the
Ching Dynasty to sign this treaty, also called the
"Sino-American Treaty on the Opening of Five Ports
for Trade", in Wanghia Village near Macao in July
1844. Its thirty-four articles stipulated that
whatever rights and privileges, including consular
jurisdiction, were gained by Britain through the
Treaty of Nanking and its annexes would also
accrue to the United States"

Doesn't seem to me that there are any good guys
here, between Brits and Yanks.

> or the "Boxer
>Rebellion" were?

This would be the rebellion where America sent a
contingent of 2,500 sailors and marines to protect
their interests?

Where John Barrett, once the United States
Minister to Siam, wrote of the conflict;

"We are a moral as well as a material force. We
are a civilizing as well as an exploiting agency.
This is a supreme test in the competition of
nations, in a struggle where the principle of the
survival of the fittest has its stern and cruel
application. Possibly now, as in China and the
allied nations of the world are in deadly struggle
in North China, whether with riotous hordes, or
government forces, our Anglo-Saxon race, our
Anglo-Saxon religions, our Anglo-Saxon systems of
society and government are at stake. We cannot
therefore, quail before our responsibility. There
is no question of imperialism or expansion
involved other than that of the salvation of our
race and our institutions"


Not exactly disapproving bystanders were they?
