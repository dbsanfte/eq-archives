I was a 2h'er ranger and would have taken Vanazir if I'd kept playing,
but certainly many of my peers were keen on things like timespinner and
the edge of eternity. Its not entirely clearcut - my thing about 2h'ers
was more I liked the look than anything, and *especially* Vanazirs
'oooh pretty bubbles!' feel ;)

I'm not sure a non raiding ranger can do much better than a greatstaff
of the four winds nowadays though.. maybe with LDON augments? Any
ideas?
