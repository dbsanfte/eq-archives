Well, I'm not sure if they're commercially available, but I did some 
testing of satellite gear that had about a 280-300ms latency.  Not great, 
but also not much more than latency of a modem.  The projected customer 
base were ISPs in developing nations, get a T1 even where the local telco 
can't provide high-speed circuits.  The price was reasonable enough that I 
could see home users buying it, though the ISP charges wouldn't be 
trivial.

The technology to make satellite a workable IP transport medium exists.  
It could conceivably be cheaper than land-line overall.  I just don't see 
anyone investing much money into satellite until the tech market as a 
whole rebounds.
