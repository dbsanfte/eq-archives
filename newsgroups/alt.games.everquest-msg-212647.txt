Well, you know -- *EVERYTHING*! True things, false things, hypothetical
things, incomprehensible and meaningless things, contradictory and paradoxical
things, the works. He knows what color shoes you're wearing. He knows 3=4.
He knows what color invisible pink unicorns really are. He knows
grrrflaflflaflflaflmmmmmmgaa. He knows how free will and omniscience work
hand in hand. He knows the truth of "I will call you tomorrow" for unbounded
values of "I", "you", and time. He's so omniscient, He not only knows
riddles so convoluted they actually stump Himself, but He knows the answers
too!

Can't leave anything out of "everything", otherwise it wouldn't be
real omniscience.
