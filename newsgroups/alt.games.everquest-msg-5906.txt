Most monk disciplines aren't worth the trouble to hit a button to use them. 
The resistant discipline is, however, one of the ones I consider useful.  I
didn't consider it useful at lower levels though.  Only 45+ did it actually
become useful, as before that the resistance granted wasn't good enough and
the casters I was fighting weren't good enough for it to make much
difference.

The most useful, and at the same time lamest, discipline is the stonestance
one (51 I think).  With an _extremely_ short duration, combined with a
really long recycle time, it's really only good for _very_ limited uses.  It
could be a great discipline, but the way it is right now it's just mediocre.
