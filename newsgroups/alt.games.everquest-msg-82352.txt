When you buy, say the Everquest Trilogy, it comes with an account key.  You
install the software, and when you create a new account it asks you for that
account key.  You now have an account with original+velious+kunark.  You can
then install that software on however many computers and log onto that
account.  Now if you want another account, you must buy another copy of the
software.  Fire up EQ and create another new account with the account key
from the new software.  You can then log onto EITHER of those accounts from
whatever computers you are playing on.  So, yes, you can have as many
account on a computer as you want.  You just install the software once and
make new accounts as you want with those new account keys you bought,
logging into whichever account you want to when you fire up EQ.
