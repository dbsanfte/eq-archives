Realistic does not equal a fun game. Besides, there are many forms of
meditation practiced in the world, including Sufi Dancing, which don't
involve being oblivious to the world. Only seeing the text in fights all
the way to L50 sucked ass, and it was only Brad's obstinacy that
inflicted it on the playerbase as long as it was. Because they couldn't
program his idea of having the book slowly fade away, he chose to do
nothing rather than just get rid of the damn thing.
