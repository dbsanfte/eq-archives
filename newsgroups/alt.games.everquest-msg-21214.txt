Okay, here is my vent.. Healers please heal me so I can go get another mob!
I've had a run of bad groups lately, where I kept wondering if half the
people were AFK during fights. Including the healer!  Several times I'd be
below two bubbles of health at the end of the fight, and had to stand around
waiting to get a heal before I could go get another mob (and last night the
cleric was at more than 80mana every time I asked, so it wasn't a mana
issue). In Dreadlands the only way you get decent experience in a full group
is to pull constantly, preferably chain pulling. I think I'm going to start
booting people from my group who aren't paying attention to what's going on.
I just don't have the patience for it.

And, in your example do NOT run after the puller to heal. I wouldn't expect
the healer in my group to do that. I usually don't go out to pull at less
than 4/5, but if I see a nearby mob, I might go grab it. Being a monk I
don't have big problems with overpulls and if SoW wears off I'd probably FD
if I was getting beat on. Next time the puller runs off, tell him/her that
you won't be chasing after them to heal them, and if they want a heal, stay
near the group.

Simple enough! Let 'em die if they don't listen! (can you tell I haven't had
my morning caffeine?)
