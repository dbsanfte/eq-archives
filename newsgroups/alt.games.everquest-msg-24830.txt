Blacksmithing has been nerfed badly in Cabilis. My skill is at 201 and am
trying to get it to 202 making Cabilis Scale Armor.
My Cha is 105 and after buying all the stuff and making it and selling it
back to merchant I used to only lose about 1pp per item.
Also when making scales I used to get about 1 failure per 40 trys.

Now after the patch they have dropped the price on the items by 15pp so now
I am losing 16pp per item which is really annoying
as anyone that does blacksmithing knows how expensive it is. But what is
worse is that I now fail about 8 times out of 40 as well.

I reported it as a but as there was no mention of it in the patch message, I
hope they get it fixed soon.

Cheers
