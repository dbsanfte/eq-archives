I never wanted a paw of opolla just on principle, and I probably
should have contacted you a couple months ago when I had a howling
harpoon (it found another buyer before I saw you around again).

Anyway, I was in city of mist last night, and the black reavers
repeated their habit of never dropping anything around me. However,
thanks to my new bestest friend, Tzirathk the sarnak ghost, they no
longer have to :)
