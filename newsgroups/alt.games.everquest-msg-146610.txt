Some people should REALLY not be allowed to play EQ.

We were going to Fear this friday, the plane is uncamped, so we gather 
at the portal and prepare to go in. A guy show up with 1 group (we later 
found out from people who he been in guild with before getting kicked, 
that he play the whole 8 person group himself), and tell us that hes on 
a CR, wont KS any of our mobs. We of course let him in, and get ready to 
go in ourselves. We go in, and run to wall. The guy fighting there too, 
and appeareantly his CR were over, because now he tell us to leave, and 
that he wanna till Draco, which is up at the time.
Since we were gathering first, and letting him in for a CR, we dont 
exactly feel like cancelling our raid because 1 group get there first 
because he lie to us about why he go there, so we move a little away 
from him, and start killing mobs ourselves too.
A little time passes, and suddently Draco decide to roam over near the 
hill, without being pulled. Neither him or us were in any way ready to 
kill, so both his group and our raid get wiped.
He log a cleric in and rez his group, we get there again and get rezzed.
We fight a little, and see him pulling Draco. Well, cant do much when he 
pulled first, so we move away to avoid getting aggro. He fail to slow 
it, and get wiped, and Draco aggro us. Were still not ready, half the 
raid get killed, all clerics camp out, and just after that, someone 
manage to land slow, and our monks and rogues actually manage to kill 
the darn think without any clerics, since they had to log on alts to see 
if it were safe to log back in. We get in again, rez the guy to be 
friendly to him, although he dont really deserve it.
He then start to /ooo about how we steamrolled him and stole his mob. 
Dont wanna answer on if we should just have let 30 people die to let him 
try again, but continue in ooc. No big deal, since only him and us in 
zone, so we just ignore him, no need to start a flame fest over a moron 
like him. To his credit we can say that he at least didnt try to ninja 
the loot, although we did keep the corpse blocked at all time to prevent it.

Then today were fighting in ToV, only ones there, and guess who show up, 
mr. 1 man group. We noticed right away (someone did a /who), but only 
his 60 cleric there, and us. Then suddently in OOC, he say "opening HoT 
door, and then 10 sec after hes gated out and is now in WW, appearantly 
trying to kill us, if we had been at HoT door. Luckily we were deeper 
inside HoT, so no harm done, and therefor no way to petition him over it 
(could have petitioned him if he had managed to kill use, but a pathetic 
try which dont work cant be proved as a try to kill our raid). He then 
move his 8 person group inside HoT and try to steal our mobs. Luckily we 
been cleaning for a while, so got the mobs timed, so able to pull every 
time one pop, both to make sure he cant KS us, and to aviod him training 
us. After around 1 hour he finally go away and move to another place in HoT.

I almost hope he manage to kill us by some petitionable way someday, so 
we can get rid of the moron from our server. No wonder all his chars are 
guildless, by asking around we found out hes been kicked by 4 guilds so far.
