On my server, there are high-level characters named "Terrist"
and "Panam".  The names weren't picked to "mean" anything, they
just sounded good.

But around the time of the recent trial of the guys who bombed the
plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, these players decided that current
events, and their coincidental player names, called for a black 
humor duel.  So throughout EC, the message was broadcast, 
"Terrist has defeated Panam in a duel to the death!"
