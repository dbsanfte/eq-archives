I have a 24 cleric and  I am only concerned about loot since symbols cost
money and when you have 1 person in a group looting every corpse and NOT
sharing it annoys me since i am usually sitting on my arse medding.  All i
ask is for them to share the loot Usually the money to pay for my spell
components.
