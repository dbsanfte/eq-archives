When something important happens IRL, I tell my close family and friends,
but not the whole world.

When I "ding" in the game, I'm eager to tell my guild and my RL relatives
whom I play the game with.... and even the party of strangers I might
currently be grouped with....

But not the whole zone.

Maybe I've played the Zeks a bit too often :-)
