Lol, that sounds almost identical to my expieriences if I split them 
between my shaman and my dwarven paladin.

The paladin drowned under the docks in Freeport, then I learned how to 
swim, and retrieved the corpse, after riding the boat back over from BBM.  
My shaman is the one that made his own banded armor, and sold a few sets 
as well.
