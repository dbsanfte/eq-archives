I have read and tried most of the posts that have been posted previous
to mine. I have run anti-virus, disk cleanup, disk defrag, updated
from microsoft, Direct X, my vid card, have disabled the built in
sound card, un-installed EQ then re-installed EQ to no avail.
I am very desperate here. I am talking to EQ tech and they seem to be
wanting to do thing I have already done, which I do again. There seems
to be no actual rhyme or reason for this to be happening.
Any and all help would be great!!!
Thanks

Sean
