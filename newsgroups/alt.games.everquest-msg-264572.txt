Actually, I didn't describe the Heroic Action (HO) system at all, thanks for 
that important addition. The HO system is complex and I think very few 
people understand how it works (I hear more questions on this than even 
"Where is Vhalen tower"). But you're right, it's clearly one of the areas 
that could distinguish skilled players from not-so-skilled. I really should 
have covered it as part of the description on combat, and certainly in the 
discussion with Ben about skill.

HO's have had an interesting evolution. At first they were regarded with 
some skepticism, mostly I think because they're so bizarre and complex that 
most players couldn't figure them out. Then a kind of hierarchy developed 
where those groups who knew how to execute successfully on the HO were the 
elite, and those who couldn't got razed as noobs. I remember group leaders 
having fits at players who broke starting chains or or failed to complete 
HOs, and a long, slow learning curve where eventually it got to the point of 
most players at least understanding how to execute on the wheel, if not the 
starting chain. HOs were cool and esoteric.

Then there was stage two of the evolution where many players came to the 
conclusion that the HO was mostly not worth the effort. Sure, there was some 
benefit to the group from successful execution, but in the battles of the 
teens, this added benefit went unused on fast fights that didn't provide 
enough opportunity to execute a whole starter chain and subsequent HO. There 
were also some dangerous side effects, since one of the "beneficial" effects 
of a successful HO execution could be an AE spell and I remember the 
arguments over "Who did the AE and got the friggin aggro?!?!", when in fact 
it was because the group successfully executed on an HO that they were 
punished. And then of course the bug that caused HOs to be completely taken 
out of the system for weeks while they worked out a solution. HOs were in 
pretty low regard at that time and I frankly wasn't sure they were ever 
coming back.

I think HO's have reached a state of acceptance now where soloers definitely 
count on them, most groups are still baffled by them, and the elite power 
players who have now started to get into the 20's, 30's and a few 40's are 
understanding that in the big, close battles with mobs of insane power, 
every last bit of advantage needs to be eked out and milked for full value, 
and HO's are a part of that equation.

I can't provide a link to the dev post that describes HO's because it's 
still not accessible to the public, but here's a copy and paste. Hope the 
formatting works out ok. From a post by Tom Wells, designer of the system:

================================
Opportunity breakdown

Hey everyone,
A detailed explanation of heroic opportunities below:

Opportunity Icons

Opportunity icons are the building blocks of heroic opportunities. Each 
spell or combat art used by players has an opportunity icon associated with 
it, which can trigger or advance a heroic opportunity. The icons are divided 
into four groups, one for each archetype.

Fighter (blue)
Sword
Shield
Horn
Fist
Boot
Flexed arm

Priest (gold)
Chalice
Holy Symbol
Hammer
Eye
Moon
Druidic Stones

Scout (green)
Dagger
Bow
Mask
Lock
Cloak
Coin

Mage (red)
Wand
Lightning
Tome
Staff
Fire
Star

Starter chains are a sequence of icons that can trigger a heroic 
opportunity. When completed, heroic opportunities cast a spell effect that 
benefits the party.

1.) Open a starter chain

A starter chain appears when you use a spell or combat art that happens to 
be the first link in a starter chain. When the chain is initiated, the icon 
of the spell or combart art that began it appears in the center of a circle 
with possible link icons around it that are blinking.

2.) Continue the chain

Use a spell or combat art that has one of the link icons associated with it. 
This responsibility is shared by the entire party. If anyone in the group 
uses a spell or combat art other than one with a matching icon, then the 
starter chain is lost and a new one must be started from scratch.

3.) Completing a Starter Chain

Repeat step two until a starter chain is complete. If completed, the starter 
chain initiates a heroic opportunity from its opportunity list. Currently 
each starter chain can choose one of three opportunities: common, uncommon, 
or rare.

4a.) Heroic Opportunity Completion

The party can complete a heroic opportunity by using spells and abilities 
with icons that match those in he opportunity wheel. Sometimes an 
opportunity wheel requires the opportunities to be completed in a certain 
order; other times it does not. If one of your abilities can advance the 
opportunity wheel, the icon for that spell or combat art will blink.
Using a spell or combat art that doesn't match the next icon in the wheel 
does not cancel the opportunity; however, it will not advance the 
opportunity wheel. Each opportunity has a time limit of 30 seconds; if it 
isn't completed in that time, the opportunity fails.

4b.) Heroic Opportunity Shift

Each opportunity has a special shift icon associated with it: the coin. 
Scouts may use combat arts with that symbol to shift to another heroic 
opportunity. They may do this only once and must use the ability before any 
others have been used to advance the opportunity wheel.

Starter Chains
Currently 15 different starter chains exist, one for each combination of 
archetype professions. The single profession starter chains are as follows:

Fighter: boot � sword � taunt
Scout: cloak � dagger
Priest: druidic stone � hammer
Mage: star - lightning

Feel free to ask questions if you are confused by my explanation. Also, I 
realize some of these may be out of whack balance wise. If you see any that 
you believe are either too weak or too powerful  please, let me know.

-Tom

Forgot this part:

Heroic Opportunity effects use the level of the encounter engaged to 
determine their power. So, if used to fight greys the effects will be much 
lower than against NPCs equal level or higher.

Edit: Fixed formatting. Added explanation on encounters determining relative 
power of an opportunity.
