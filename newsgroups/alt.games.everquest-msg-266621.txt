...and wanting telephone tech support to setup email program.

Now - I am all for looking after people with disabilities but there comes a 
point where things just aren't going to work, like trying to dog sled with 2 
simese cats and chiuaha. And the clincher? Well, after 40 minutes spent 
repeating myself till my brain started oozing out of my nose and not even 
finding out what email program he used he said, and I quote:

"maybe I should get my hearing aid and glasses"

Ahh - my head - it hurts. Please make the stupid people stoppppp!
