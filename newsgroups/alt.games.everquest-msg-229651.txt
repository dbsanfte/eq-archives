The couple of times I've ventured there, I've gotten at least some 
helpful advice if not specific information pertaining to my problem. 
Sure, I had to repeat my question several times on each occasion until a 
guide or GM noticed me in all the sophomoric crap going on, but its 
purpose was served.

Sorry you haven't had any luck there, but I've gotten something out of it 
every time I've tried it.

Really, no offense, but that's just silly. The purpose of a thing is the 
use for which it was intended. A screwdriver's purpose isn't to be used 
as a crowbar or chisel, even though so many put it to those very uses all 
the time.
