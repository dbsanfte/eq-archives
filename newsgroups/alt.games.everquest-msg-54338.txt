I would have to say I'm a little curious as to whats comming up.  Today's
patch files seem to preclude a new plane, but what about next weeks patch?
Verant has stated on the dev boards that these patches are not for Luclin
and this has me thinking that maybe something new is coming next week.
Could it be the new plane or some other new surprise content?  Todays patch
may be preliminary data and/or zone portals?  I suspect that today and
tonight, some of these GM events will give some great hints.  We will see.
Having a large patch of new zone files occure a week after a big event night
would be a good idea too.

I wonder what the inside thinking at Verant was about the rumors of a new
plane the occured many months ago when the karanas plague hit.  Many players
where all geared up for it back then.  Do you think they felt some pressure
to make a new plane? I always wondered...

Orlun, erternal Rake of the 51st plane
