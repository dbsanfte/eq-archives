Yeah, a friend pointed out that I could make more by selling to the gypsies
than I do selling to the Innkeeper :( Problem is that I'd have to run to NK
(didn't know about the Oasis or SRo gypsies) Although, maybe it's worth it
for the trouble! I guess I'd have to stick everything in the bank (just so
I'd have room!) and make a run every hour or so. Those damn things just
don't seem to drop as fast as I can kill wisps ;)

Hmmm... this quest is open to all, or is it simply a class quest? I'd
appreciate hearing about it, if you're willing to impart the knowledge :)
All I heard from my friend was that the the gypsies would buy them for more
pp. Maybe it's time for me to go read up on the quests again!

Huh... I don't think I've ever seen anyone selling a LS in E or WCommons...
but then, I'm a failure at keeping track of those auction messages :)

Wow... sounds like a very worthwhile endeavor, cakewalk or not :) Is the
quest listed on Allakazzam? If not, I'd appreciate a heads-up on it!

thanks,
Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
