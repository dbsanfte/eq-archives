After I upgraded to DX8, I switched my in-game driver to Direct3D.
Actually, with my Voodoo3, I get faster frame rates, and the detail is
better.
However, there are rare artifacting problems, and jaggies in some zones.
For the boost in framerates, I'll deal with it.

If you can't switch to Primary Display Driver, make sure that your
desktop color depth is set to 16-bit, not 32-bit.
