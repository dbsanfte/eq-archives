Oh sure, you will...HOW OFTEN you do will be very interesting to see.  I
have high level characters of the top two classes for cheap buffs, druid
(sow) and enchanter (clarity), and often have access to a high level cleric
(resurrections with experience).

Neither my druid nor my enchanter ever go /role unless I start getting tells
from multiple newbie buff beggars.  And even then, I usually don't go into
hiding...I simply totally ignore the person requesting it, and I don't feel
any guilt whatsoever.

It's harder to ignore people begging for resurrections (Reviviscence),
especially if they're in a Hell Level (30,35,40,45) or high level (51+) so
him I usually stick on /roleplay.  It's frightfully easy to ignore rez
requests from anyone under 51 not in a hell level, though.
