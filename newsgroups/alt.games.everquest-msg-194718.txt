Speaking of, does anyone know the exact formula for defense/lvl for
the int casters. At the early lvls it _seemed_ to follow (lvl+1)*4 but
since hitting the low teens it appears to be less than that. I'm
currently sitting at 63 defense on my 16th lvl wizard and was just
wondering whether that's max or not. I'd also like to know what max is
for any given lvl so I know when to stop tanking. 

Rgds, Frank
