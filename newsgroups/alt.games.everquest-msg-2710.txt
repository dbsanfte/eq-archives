PLAYER-TAG CHANGES

As part of a continued development by Verant in improving gameplay
and communication between players some significant changes are
apparently about to go on the Test Server to enable players to more
easily find each other.  Here is the summary:

The player tags for /anonymous and /roleplay are gone.  It will no longer
be possible to hide your class or guild from a /who.  This has
apparently been done to help Clerics, Druids and Wizards be more
easily accessible to players.
New tags of /help and /nohelp have been introduced.  These will
display above your character as a + or - symbol to reflect if you are
currently acting as a player who will assist in general or are preferring
not to do so.  They will not however show up in a /who.
It is hoped that these changes will help make the community of players
on the servers tighter and more group-friendly to one another.

Ummm excuse me? Did Verant ever wonder why people go anonymous? Hello?

Don't get me wrong I teleport, sow and rez and cast buffs whenever I can
but If I didn't have my classes hidden in a who list I would get way too many tells.
This is just stupid.

Plus they don't say if your level is still hidden, so if its not that means high level
people are going to get tons of "can you spare some plat and items plz" tells
from beggars.
