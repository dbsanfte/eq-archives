Which, of course, at the time it was made, it was the only 15 damage 
piercer in game.  (well, actually there was another, but it was so 
extremely limited that it's not worht talking about).

Even today, the daggers you'd replace it with are not easy to come by.  
Not just because of the base damage but the stats and effect.
