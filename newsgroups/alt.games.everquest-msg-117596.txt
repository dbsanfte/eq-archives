The bars of metal do not drop anywhere as far as I know; they must be 
purchased. The gems *do* drop: jasper off low level mobs (bandits in 
various zones, various mobs in the loio, evil eyes in the gorge), rubies 
off high level mobs.  I have seen rubies drop rarely off geonids in cc 
and wakening lands and mobs in hate and fear, and I looted a sapphire 
off a wurm in skyfire the other day, so I assume rubies might drop there 
as well, although I haven't actually seen one yet. All in all, though, 
it's going to be *much* easier for you to just buy them.
