You can literally skip the first two shawl quests if you haven't
done them already.  THe cooking part starts independantly
of it and yields the seal; to get your third shawl you hand
in the seal and the second and you get the seal and the third
back...but the seal has all the stats even before you hand
it in!

Auto split is a total ripoff.  Get a master looter, or take turns
looting..
or even (shudder) go FFA loot and make a point of grabbing your
fair share.

Here's why auto is bad:

Loot 5pp 6gp 7cp 8sp

split 2 ways:
looter 3pp 3gp 4cp 4sp
you 2pp 3gp 3cp 4sp

split three ways
Looter 3pp 2gp 3cp 4sp
you 1pp 2gp 2cp 2sp

Split four ways
Looter 2pp 3gp 4sp 2cp
you 1pp 1gp 1cp 2cp

split five ways
Looter 1pp 2gp 3sp 4cp
you 1pp 1gp 1sp 1cp

split six ways
looter 5pp 1gp 2sp 3cp
you 0pp 1gp 1sp 1cp

unless there are large amounts of change, the looter ends up
with an average of three times what anyone else does... at
the low end he'll end up with dozens of times more cash
value than the rest of you... whenever there isn't enough
plat dropped to go all the way around once, as you can
see by that last example... he looted 5123 coppers while
everyone else got 111cp worth of loot: 46 times as much!
