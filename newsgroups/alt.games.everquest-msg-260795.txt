As a cleric, I dont think [to the best of my memory] that I have 
ever had rune cast on me....in general the only chanter luv I get 
is mind candy for my mana-fu. Granted, I actually have at least 1 
stack of dots on all my alts because you can never tell when you 
are going to need some sort of buff, and dots are a reasonable 
donation for just about anything as a plat equivalent - hand over 
however many = the normal plat doantion and not have to worry 
about having coins onhand=) and since all my alts have at least 1 
100% WR bag, the weight is negligable=) [ok, hubbys monk has 
*all* 100% wr bags, but he sort of needs it or he cant loot stuff 
at all...]
