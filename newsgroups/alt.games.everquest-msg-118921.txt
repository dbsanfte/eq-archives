Since my first ever character was a dwarf, it's Butcherblock I feel
most at home in, that's where I discovered Norrath for the first time
and I barely left BB for the first couple weeks. Yes, it really does
feel like home there even now more than three years later.

I got to know some other zones exceedingly well after a while too of
course. But they don't quite have the 'home' feeling BB gives. Even
zones I have spent very high amounts of time in, like LG and SolB
preKunark (South Karana comes close to a second home), Sebilis and the
idiot cycle after Kunark came out, WL and GD in Velious (and ToV), and
nowadays in Paludal, Dawnshroud, and Umbral... they just don't elicit
the same feelings as BB even though if I had logs right from the
beginning they would have probably as much time spent in them.
