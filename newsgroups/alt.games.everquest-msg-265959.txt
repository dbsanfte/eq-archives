Depends. Are you done claiming that "churn rate" is anything other
than bullshit?

The fact that someone thinks *any* computer game, online or not, will
be able to hold onto the *majority* of its players over *five years*
is just plain laughable. This "expert" could not appear any more
clueless. Not even the most successful games of all time such as
Diablo 2 did that. He tries to measure it against low population and
free MUDS and similar from different eras. Simply absurd.

I predict "churn rate" becomes the next code words for people who want
to appear like they know what they are talking about with mmorpgs but
really don't.

Because you make idiotic judgements based on "churn rate", mostly.
Also because you seem to assume since you don't like EQ it must mean
no one else does either.


>    As for your second tactic of "Look folks, his opinion is worthless
>because other people like it."  Poor trolling form.

The fact other people like it directly contradicts your assessment of
the devs competency. Trying to pass that off as a "troll" merely
establishes you are trying to evade that fact and reinforces the
perception you think because you don't like something everyone else
must not either.

So you don't like EQ. You've established that, yes. What you've failed
to do is give any evidence for your arguments that it is "failing"
because of "churn rate". Or failing at all. Or that its a bad game at
all. Hell all you seem to know how to do is quote statistics from
someone who's opinion is already proven to be both highly biased and
based on extremely poor statistical manipulation. Obviously he was
desperate to come up with some way to dilute the effect of EQ's big
numbers and after scrabbling around came up with the absurd "churn
rate"....

Hehe. He's getting a bit ornery now, folks. :-) And since when is
tearing your argument to shreds "weakass debating tactics"? I would
suggest evading the arguments presented (that's you) would be far more
of a crime....

And I think the irony of you switching to ad hominem while accusing me
of "weakass debating tactics" is quite defeaning.

Finally I throw your own question back at you. How come you started
crying and screaming when it was pointed out to you that EQ's numbers
were in fact quite strong, stronger than any other NA mmorpg? Does the
poor little baby cry so loud because someone else DARES to have an
opinion differeing from poor little baby?

*snicker*

Still stuck in ad hominem. You're really starting to crack up, I think
I'm going to LIKE toying with you. 'Bawling infant' from the guy
whining like a pitiful little child! LOL!

The information has already proven to be worthless. There is nothing
to this magical "churn rate".

I am pointing out the inherent flaws in "churn rate" and the inherent
bias against EQ from the original author. And making you look like a
complete fool in the process, btw. :-D

So they have. Good for CoH. It doesn't change the fact EQ is still the
most successful NA mmorpg of all time and that your opinion is just
that, an opinion, and one rather lacking in any substantial evidence
to support it.

EQ has already earned its stripes and has nothing it has to prove to
haters such as yourself. And GOD does that bug you, doesn't it? All
that time hating EQ and it still managed to become successful despite
all your hate!

It *galls* you... eats away at you from the inside.... why oh why
couldn't your preferred game be the one that was most successful?
After all, EQ is suckfest defined! How could anyone like it! Obviously
since you hate it everyone else should too! Woe is you, woe is you....
Must find ways to dilute EQ's popularity... oh look, some crazed EQ
hating UO fan has come up with a twisted statistical interpretation
that allows him to call EQ a failure! Let's use that! Huzzah! Huzzah!

I really wanted to laugh at his "analysis" at this point. Oh noes, a
nerf! A nerf! Obviously Verant hates the players and want to burn
their puppies! Oh noes! Ebay auctions were banned! Verant must be
stopped for the good of freedom and kittens
everywhere!!!11!1!eleven11!1

I can only draw on what you present. If you present a braindead
argument, then I blame your lack of either experience or intelligence.
Start showing some sign that you have any clue of how the industry
works and I'll start taking you more seriously, noob.

He has already been caught doing dubious statistical manipulation and
his bias has been exposed.

You're one of those people who believe because someone prints it and
it contains numbers it must be God's Own Truth, aren't you?

This is just more evidence that both you and he are galled by EQ's
otherwise undeniable success. Most successful NA mmorpg! *observes the
froth coming to George's mouth*

Yep. He's cracking up. Haven't run into a hater this zealous in a
*long* time, most of them ran and hid when EQ turned out to be
successful *and* durable.....

Pathing is better in subsequent zones, there is plenty of content
(even yucky instanced content), and when the engine upgraded lighting
became better as well though it became unnecessary when nighttime was
nerfed anyways.

So... I guess the answer is: yes?

Ah I see how that makes you qualified to judge it five and a half
years later, all of which were spent brooding over how you hate
Verant/Sony and can't understand why anyone would play such a POS....

Wait, no it doesn't... it just makes you look like a crazed hater!

I'm glad for both you and CoH. But it doesn't change EQ's success. I
do realize that you are posting this from the CoH newsgroup and that
means cultures have been crossed, but you still should have known
better than to go all zealot when the post was going to a newsgroup
you knew you would get roasted in. All you've done is establish no
opinion of yours on EQ should be taken seriously....

You were much more intelligent then. Not a raving hater at least. What
happened to you? Bad coconuts?
