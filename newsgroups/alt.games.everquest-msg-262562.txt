That's another viewpoint I consider ludicrous.  When there is a draft, feel
free to complain about people being unjustly sent off to war.  You'll hear
me saying it right next to you.  But in a 100% voluntary army, quit yer
bitchin.  If they didn't want to have the possibility of being sent off to
get shot at, they shouldn't have joined, voluntarily, the army.
