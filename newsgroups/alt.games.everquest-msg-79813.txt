Yep, I got one before the nerf, not to sell though but to do the
TWINK! My troll sk 36th level wields it now. Its really better than a
noct blade I guess when the magic damage works (29 spd 21 dam then)
AND is 15 ac, which is darn nice. I'm enjoying it quite a lot with a
20 percent or so haste belt. I think I've seen melee hits as high as
84 when soloing with it.. whee.

The two hand hammer is NOT nerfed and is about 150 percent easier than
the ethereal longsword was to get the pieces for. In fact, all of the
mobs are always up when I go to quest it (pharm) The only one thats
kind of a wait sometimes is waiting for a smuggler recuso in the
northwest corner of marus seru to actually have the hammer you need
(pharmer La~) I got one and gave it to a friend's twink druid, got
another gave it to my own kitty shaman, got another and sold it for 1
k plat (pharmer!) I don't feel bad about doing the quest since it
raises a lot of katta factions and no one else is ever camping any of
the drop npcs when I go to get them. I have another one to get now
also.. just need that hammer from recuso smugglers.

38 spd 18 dam, 2 hand blunt, 5 magic dam, 10 ac, 12 Wis !!!

Even with the nerf though, if you have the longsword of ethreal energy
that along with the scimitar make for a pretty good warrior combo
until you have something better, specially on a twink. The 29 spd and
16 dam (if the 5 magic dam works) on the scim along with its what.. 5
ac? is pretty nice with the ethreal long sword in main hand. Its kind
of fun that no one is camping the lady now in paludral for the scim
quest. ehehe. Its the last piece i need to get the scim and I killed
her twice the other day but no drop = /
