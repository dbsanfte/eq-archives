Never said I didnt think it was true now did I DT? But since you didnt
catch the obvious that pretty much makes your responce fair game. 

OK my take on why SoE is stealing:
We purchase the software from SoE, while this does not allow us to
claim ownership of the software it does give us ownership of the
media. If I would like to later resell said disks I am within my
rights however SoE by not giving me a method to free up the key, thus
prevents me from exercising those rights. This is based purely on
greed, there is no other logical answer. So my point is that SoE has
stolen from us much the same way software pirates steal from Microsoft
buy running off copys in some hole-in-the-wall country with no
copywrite laws. While it may be legal it is in no way ethical.
