Two things:

1) Since your leader is very experienced, do *exactly* what he tells
   you, no questions, no exceptions.  If you're not sure what you're
   supposed to be doing, talk to him, but if he's good at this, he'll
   explain all you need to know before you break in.

2) Don't expect any drops as a cleric.  A cleric belt drops in Fear, as
   does EM armour from phoboplasms, but both are rare.  Don't expect
   them and you won't be disappointed.
