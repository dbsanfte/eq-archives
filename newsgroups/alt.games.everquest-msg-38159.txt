Once you get to the levels where you can hunt the mobs that drop nicer
amounts of plat (eg giants) and go into zones that have mobs that drop the
sought after loot, your ability to fatten your bank account increases quite
dramatically. Once you win a roll or two on that FBSS or similar, you will
start to rake in the plat. As Jakugg mentioned, post level 30 it gets
easier, but past 40 it gets very easy to increase your bank balance...
