I am not keen on this really, don't want to do more of EQ with better FX.

Given the choice between Eq2 and SWG, I would take eq2.  God, haven't we had
enough shitty starwars games come out?  Now we can have a persistent 24/7
shitty game... wonderful :)

I agree w/you on WoW too, seems to much like a cartoon, not something that
would interest me.  In fact, I don't think I have much interest in any of
these new games coming out.  Just Halflife 2 -- it will r0xX0rz j00 4ll
