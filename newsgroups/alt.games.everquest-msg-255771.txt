Except Extended Range, and having ER on Cheal can be a big help, healing 
from further away reduces aggro and gives tanks longer to reaquire it 
should it happen.  Cheal being level 39 spell, even a ER II item will 
work for this, and continue to work even when you are level 65 (actually 
I think my cleric still has his ERIII item from hands in Karnor, but 
same principle)

Sadly the druid and shaman incomplete heals are high 50s so they can't 
get away with ERII but will have to spring for at least ERIII.  And I 
can't verify that ER works for them at all, just surmise it does since 
it works for Cheal.
