Here's a fun way to deal with the problem.  Slowly and calmly explain to the
manager that by claiming to have a product on order, taking money for that
product, not having the product available at the stated time and refusing to
return the money is fraud.  Explain the criminal law overrules corporate
policy every time.  Depending on your jurisdiction, you gently place your
hand on his shoulder, in front of witnesses, and say you are making a
citizen's arrest.  Then explain that you are going to the nearest police
station and swear out a criminal fraud complaint.  After that you will call
the local media so that they can come and video the event.

Or if you have a cell phone, call 911 and ask them what is the best way to
make a criminal complaint, right in front of the manager and witnesses.
Most business people will take a calm legal threat more seriously than an
anger loud one and the corporate suits really don't like seeing police
involved in business transactions in front of customers or media.

Threatening to go to the BBB is really pointless as they have no power to do
anything.  Most people never check the BBB before buying anything and many
businesses will leave a BBB sticker on their doors even after being told to
remove it.


Have fun and Merry Christmas,
