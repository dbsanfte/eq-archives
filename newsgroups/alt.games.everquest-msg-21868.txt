Bah.  I didn't see this as anything that "needed" a rule change,
or that "ruined the experience" for anyone.

It also proved that the "evil" players are a bunch of crybabies. :-)
From a RP sense, can you really see the armies of darkness, who
outnumber the forces of good by about 2-to-1, crying to the
authorities about how it's "not fair" that one lowly Good person
was convincing the local Giants to stomp the armies of darkness?
Waahhh!, they whine.

It might be different if the "evils" were already on the ropes,
but the fact is they own most of the zones on SZ, while the "goods"
are crowded into just a very few zones.  And then the evils
bitch and moan when they have to dodge Sand Giants?  Lol.

If I were on the evil team, I'd just get some of the level 30+ evils
(surely there *are* some now...) to simply hunt the Sand Giants
for exp and loot.  No Sand Giants, no level 5 Bards training them.
Problem solved.

Either that, or just learn to dodge.  Back when I was hunting
Oasis myself, I quickly learned how to see Sand Giants coming
from a mile away and get the heck out of their way.
