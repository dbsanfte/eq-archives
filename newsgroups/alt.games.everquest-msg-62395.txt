Those are my sentiments exactly ( well, almost, I don't like the NIC 
onboard, unless it is Intel or 3-Com and SCSI unless it is based on an 
Adaptec ).  IDE, serial and parallel are so much part of the norm now that 
I just consider them part of the mobo and not "integrated peripherals", 
although they technically are.  I don't even have my serial and parallel 
ports active on my machines, except the parallel on my wife's, because I 
have no use for them.  No reason to waste those IRQs!

It seems kind of silly that we were -so- hesitant about using those first 
boards that had IDE / Ser / Par on-board at the Uni back then, but anything 
new is scary.  I prefer to let others try out the new technologies.
