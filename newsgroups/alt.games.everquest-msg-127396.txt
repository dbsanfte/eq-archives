Now that you mention it I have seen it several times the last few days.  The
first time someone was asking me for manasong.  I told him I had been
playing it all along and he must not be close enough to me.  He told me he
was right next to me but I couldn't see him and he was not invisible.  So I
think it is not just a lag thing.  I think it is a server side bug.  Else it
would not have affected the song.
