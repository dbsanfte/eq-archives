}Up to you, but I would have made absolutely sure that he knew what he was

}quest or what-not. It sort of seems like you cheated him--IE, you knew it
}wasn't worth that much and didn't tell him. It's up to you, though, of course.

Eh, I don't think it's a cheat.  If the guy sent me a tell saying 'Hey! I 
just found out it's not worth that much to me!' within about half an hour, 
I'd probably give a refund on it.  I'd much rather have a good rep than 
have someone feel ripped off.  But it's also possible, that for whatever 
reason, it was really worth that much to him.  Perhaps he _really_ likes 
the look of that axe, and _really_ didn't want to auction for it more than 
30 seconds, and has money falling out his butt.


The closest parallel I can think of is the day Befallen changed to DEs the 
first time.  I got a koada'dal ribcage in the basement.  It's a shield 
with moderate stats, not as good as CGS, but not bad for a lowbie shaman.  
I took it over to EC and tried to get a pricecheck, nobody knew, of 
course, because it was a new item.  I chatted with my guild, we decided it 
was probably worth about 200.  Then I got a /tell "are you selling one?"  
I said yah, and the guy offered 650...  I hurried over to the tunnel to 
meet him, of course. :)  The trade went flawlessly, but then it turned out 
that the reason he'd offered so much was that he thought it was a 
chestpiece... d'oh!  So of course I gave a refund.  The terms of the sale 
weren't clear.  

But this other guy's buying a velium battleaxe.  Can he not know the 
stats?  Did he not get to inspect the merchandise before hitting trade?  


I dunno, if you really feel guilty about it, ask him.  Maybe there's a 
reason he gave you such a good deal.
