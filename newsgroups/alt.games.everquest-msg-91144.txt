Dunno. I brought about every character I have (including erudites,
woodelves etc) to Kunark, simply because I liked the newbie areas most
(had to carry a load of spells though). This also meant frequent run
backs to Antonica for training skills etc. I have run countless times
through OR, WW, FV, LOIO, FM, DL etc, avoiding nearly everything fine.
All you need is a good link with no lag and common sense. Just don't
round hilltops, with no idea what's behind etc, walk in a way you
always see what is in front of you, use zone walls and so on and it
works. All you need is time. Lots of time. Those boat trips and huge
zones in kunark will use up hours :) Or you could ask a druid/wizard
in LOIO for a port :P
