I really don't think this is gonna happen much unless it's between VERY good
friends. Are you going to PL them first and hope they keep their end of the
bargain? Or ask them to let you loot the item (assuming it's a NODROP) on a
promise of future PLing? This scenario is so unlikely it's impossible to
make a point with it imho.

A NODROP LORE tag will decrease Farming but increase Camping, as everyone
who wants the item will have no choice but to camp it. TCC _will_ reduce
farming simply because it's a lot harder to farm with a group of
level-appropriate characters than it is with a single high level who can mow
down the entire zone without breaking a sweat.

It isn't and never has been to restrict items to low level characters. It's
entirely in order to keep high level bottom feeders from ruining the
enjoyment of low level characters new level-appropriate zones.

Yes, and imho it's a record that has improved markedly in the 2+ years the
game has been live. I'm sure there will be a few anomolies though :)

YOU don't see a need for them yet VI does. I think you're gonna have to deal
here.
In every mid-level zone in the game right now that drops any kind of
reasonable loot that will sell for a few 100pp (Idols, Impskin Gloves, even
FBRs) you will find at least one high level player farming the place. Off
the top of my head recently Ive seen SolA's Efreeti, High Shaman and Kindle
camped by mid-50s, RunnyEye with nobody under 45 apart from my group, ToFS
loot droppers camped with spectre pets. My own appropriate level groups,
throughout my EQ career, have been denied opportunities to hunt Kaesora,
Permafrost, Najena, sections of GukB, all because high level farmers looking
to fill their second backpack with the drops from the mobs there. Not for
themselves: for their twinks or to sell.
Now there are 2 more points I want to make but they don't really follow from
your post. Here they are anyway:
1) The Warrens. I've seen it mentioned many times but the reason the warrens
is empty has NOTHING to do with the TCC. The Warrens is empty because the
drops there are RUBBISH, even for players of the appropriate level. That and
the fact that it's too far off the beaten track for pickup groups.
2) Obviously if you can't camp the object yourself it is easy to buy it at
auction (blah blah why should I buy it when i could just go camp it - yeah
yeah shadap and drop a couple of 100pp on the newbs it'll be good for your
soul). If it's nodrop lore, well we all ready have an example in game of
this being dealt with don't we? The Mask of the Deceiver, LORE, NODROP, and
often looted by players of an inappropriate level. Pretty simple, huh?
Oh yeah, there's a third:
3) Stop bringing up the AC as an example of how the TCC will suck. I haven't
seen any plans to move the AC to Luclin so it's another non-issue.

Many, many times. But then the players usually ask for unreasonable things.

 yet this is the first real time

IMHO TCC is a good thing and anybody throwing their toys out of the pram
over it should just quit the game and do the rest of us a favour.

But either way, I don't post here any more so don't read all this ;p
