'bout friggin' time they started kicking out laws that are put in the
books for absolutely no reason other than the fact they enforce
Christian values...

When you speak of "Christian values" in that way the clear implication
is that these (unspecified!) "values" are universal to all Christians.

/quote

Please give a cite to back that particular assumption, as long as
we're on the topic of you making assumptions.
