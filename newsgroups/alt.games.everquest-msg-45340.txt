Better, add another item with Levitate on it, so that we all lose interest
in that silly impossible Quillmane camp.

Here's a thought, have it clickable levitate but require bat wing
components!  That way its not as good as the Quillmane, but
still quite decent; people who -did- do the quillmane camp will
still lord it over us like Jboot wearers look down on TBoot
buyers...

Or one of the horses in Luclin could be a pegasus; fly and SOW
all in one package.  25Kpp?
