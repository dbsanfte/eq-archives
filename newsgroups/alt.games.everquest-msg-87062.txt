Get the guild's Druids and anyother healers to follow you and keep you alive
at all costs, go to zones with exp bonuses at your level Kerra Island off of
Tox. get a decent 1hb faster the better. Start beating on the Mobs solo with
a DS on . When exp gets thin move to SOL A, next Dalnir, Burning Woods
(Hornets nest). BTW Exp rezes don't come till level 34. Class PL101
concluded.
