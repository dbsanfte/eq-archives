I believe all eggs can be used in baking, and make wildly different
amounts of dough, snake eggs, for example, yield one dough
per combine, while substituting in griffin eggs (not snow griffin,
don't panic) yeilds a partial stack of 6 or 8

If (as seems likely) the non-drake eggs you are finding are good
for nothing more specific, they at least ought to be good for
a half stack of dough per combine
