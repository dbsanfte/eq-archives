First, that's a totally bullshit response.  SOE puts up 14 classes
for you to choose from, and nowhere do they say "don't play class
Xyz because it's a worthless piece of shit that no knowledgeable
player will group with unless you have saved their only child from
certain death IRL".  And yet, that is only a tiny (and I do mean
tiny) exageration of the situation during Kunark, especially early
in the Kunark era.

Second, the spells aren't unimportant.  They just don't have anywhere
near the value imagined by Warriors afflicted with severe penis envy,
with the shining exception of our stuns.

Third, and probably most important, Warriors are the most gawdawful
boring class there is to play in EQ, bar none (somebody shush those
Clerics).

So, I'm glad they're giving the pure melees something fun to do, and
I hope they somehow manage to give Warriors just enough of an aggro
upgrade to put them on a level playing field with the Knights for XP
grouping.  And I wish the Paladins whining "no fair, we want magic
star power-ups too, how come only pure melees get them" would STFU.
We have spells (and our near-worthless disciplines) already in place,
if we need upgrades at some future date the mechanisms are there.
Let the pure melees have their new toys without bitching about it and
and hope that somehow, against all odds, SOE manages to fix Warriors
(and Monks) without the usual flaming halberd sideways up the south
entry for some random bystander or other.
