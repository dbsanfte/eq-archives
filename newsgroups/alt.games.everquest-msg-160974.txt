I disagree too.  I've been cleric for a busy wastelands group as well as my
own "soloing" efforts, and notice no difference.  The problem is of course,
with mobs hitting so hard, you have to heal much much sooner.

In velks I could pull 5 spiders at the same time, and Id cast a cheal at
1.5k HP, when we were doing the guards in PoV castle (65 warrior, 8.6khp)
cheal had to be started at 60%hp
