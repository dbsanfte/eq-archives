Hmm, did you also notice that The Station is NOT just Everquest.  In other 
words, there was quite a bit more than EQ that was not reachable (though 
all Sony related).

OK, now you are an idiot.  There are well over a 1000 servers just for 
Everquest.  Let's take a nice, round number, like 300Watts each (because 
it's the rating of most low-end PCs, I know it's low).  Now that's over 
300,000W, which is over 2700 Amps.  Sure, why don't you just go take your 
little diagonal cutting pliers down to San Diego, climb the pole, and snip 
it.  Hell, I'll even buy the pliers for you.
Of course, if they're in any professional grade datacenter that I've been 
involved with, they have two separate power feeds coming into two 
different sides of the facility.  Also, cutting the power != hacking.  
Hell, what you're thinking of != hacking.

When you make absolutely moronic statement (even when they exhibit 
ignorance rather than stupidity), expect to be flamed.  Oh no!  My friend 
isn't picking up the phone, he must have been kidnapped by Taliban and 
forced to be a suicide bomber.
