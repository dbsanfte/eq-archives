My druid/enchanter combo (2 computers) was silly enough to decide that the
blue corrupted furbie in OOT shouldn't be that hard.  After wasting the vast
majority of my mana I finally had the sense to snare the bugger and just
swim for it.

Then, at about 5% mana I get the bright idea that I could, ya know, GATE out
of there.  My enchanter gates out with little trouble.  My druid is
currently swimming and doesn't have Gate memmed, and clarity had worn off.
Sooooo, still in the water he sits down, mems Gate, casts is and..."your
gate is unstable and collapses."  ARGH!!!  Now I'm at 0% mana, and have no
clarity and this big cyclops is chasing me and, since I wasn't paying
attention I almost drowned.

Bowing to the inevitable I climb to a beach and sit myself down to make
corpse recovery easier.  Luckily the giant was farther away than I thought
and I was able to gate out (talk about anti-climatic!  But I'm not
complaining).
