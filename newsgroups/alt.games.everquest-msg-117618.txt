Hmm, sounds like you're spending lots of time doing stuff that isn't
fun for you, when there's probably lot's of stuff that *is*.

Get a group together for Befallen or Runnyeye.  Go marvel at the big
city of Freeport, maybe take the boat to Faydwer.

If you really want the shiny pants, go back to the quest after you've
done a few things that you enjoy.
