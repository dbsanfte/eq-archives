45 takes 15.1 million XP to get through.  44 took 6.6 million.  My
Wizard was, if I recall correctly, averaging about 15 KXP/minute
soloing at that level, so it took about 16 hours playtime to get
through.

Can you solo a Spectre and be back to full health and mana in under 5
minutes?  If so, go take a look at the single Spectre outside the Fear
cave.  Level range is 33-37, so you will get on average (assuming
uniform distribution) 92025 XP/Spectre (no, not 91875, for those
checking my math...you averaged the levels, when you want to average
the XP...averaging the levels first only works if XP is a linear
function of level).  They pop a little over 5 minutes apart, so just
camping there slaughtering that same stupid Spectre over and over will
get you through 45 in about 15 hours.
