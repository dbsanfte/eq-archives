Imagine  you are a low level (pre 10th)

Okay  Imagine your  an insignificant  pimple at 10th lvl,

And you are a Vah Shir  Rogue  who is doing thier rogue quest on Luclin

You have spent many hours  hunting  young rock hoppers for thier eggs
which drop it seems  1 in 50  ;-)
and using your poulrty baking skill you manage to make your four pickled
eggs to complete a stage in your quest,(after failing 30 odd times to make a
pickled egg of course)

You  set off for hollowshade moor  to hand your eggs over to the guard in
question
BUT when you get there,  your eggs have vanished  gone are no more

after a few hours of  checking my last known locations  and the bank  and
everywhere else
your geting pretty wound up ,  and that annoying message thats been there
for the past doy or so
'You are hungry'  you are out of food ,  is now starting to really bug you ,

When it dawns on you ,  youve been so busy collecting your eggs , youve
forgotten to stock up
on the essentials  like food ,  and  you have eaten your quest items  ;(

Cry   ????  Yes I did

Of course  me firends  pee'd themselves with laughter  when they heard my
tail of woe  ;-)
