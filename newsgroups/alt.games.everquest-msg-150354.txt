Welcome to Norrath!
Hope you have fun.
Some websites to look at:
eq.castersrealm.com  even if you aren't a caster this is a good site, 
good tips for every class
everquest.allakhazam.com
most of the classes have a site dedicated to them and most of the 
servers, at least the older ones, do too.
google searching will come up with alot of sites too, just ignore the 
sponsored links on that page, they don't look like any good sites.
Good luck and if you have any questions ingame type this in /join 
serverwide.age:age
that will get you in the newsgroup chat.  Some people leave thier mules 
in that so if you don't get a response right away just wait a little bit.
