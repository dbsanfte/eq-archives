True .. I went there soloing at 30 and could solo about 4-5 mobs before I
had to sit down again. That brought me to 31 in no time (lol .. I forgot
that these hell levels are nothing after you had a main somewhere in the
50ies). Now most are light blue with a few blues in between, no longer
an option. While waiting in FM once near LOIO zone line, I was able to
solo a few yellow burynai digmasters even without any SK fearkiting.
They seem to have pretty low health and took my hits nicely. But there's
mot too many spawns, so the spot is not ideal.

: it might be ok for just 2 people. You could also camp outside paw... thats

Hm .. I normally avoid Antonica .. pretty everything there (censored) me
off pretty fast. I'm used to lazy Field of Bone hunting .. sitting safely
at some spot and pulling singles from a dense web of a variety of mobs in front
of me .. very lazy :) I don't know dung about Antonica though (just got very
upset once while trying to level a newbie ... NRo? How can you stand this
POS area .. no visibility, too many peeps, constant running around to
find something and those idiotic desert madmen .. nah .. I don't have
the patience for that).

: pretty deserted these days. Frontier mountains would be ok too. You could

An option I considered, but never tried, as giants usually go for 'hit strong
and have too many HP for their level'. Must try, though.

: wanderers. If you could get the spawn broken, you could camp the shadowmen

Hm, that might fit my Burynai Digger idea I mentioned... must try this as well.

: in WC/LS/innothule/SK. I wouldnt recomment camping them in LF. Clopses and

Never did that .. Antonica issue. Hear the Shadowmen ar notorious for attacking
in packs, though.

: giant skellies would be another possibility in RM.

Overcamped ... the idea of our Duoing is really to avoid palces like Sanrak Fort in
Loio, RM etc. That's why I went to more or less unusual places like FM Loiozoneline
etc. When I was in CC, it was pretty deserted as well (apart from the Queen camp
etc).
