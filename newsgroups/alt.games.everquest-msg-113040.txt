The difficulty I've found with the new "faster" leveling to 10 is that your
skills DON'T go up at a rate consistent with your accelerated leveling.  If you
twink your character this problem is magnified.  Example being a high damage
weapon kills a creature in one or two swings vs. four, five or more with the
newbie weapon.  I got to level 10 with my Ogre SK having gained only 15 points in
all my weapon skills combined.  I had to dump all my points from leveling into
training up at the guild to get my weapon skills close to par with what they
should be for the level.

Granted an Ogre isn't a fast learner, but I've also tried this with a gnome and
dwarf character with similar results.  In my opinion, the money issue is less
cumbersome than the inability to keep skills up at the accelerated rate.
