They've purposefully set the number of people allowed per server much lower
than it could be, to get people to spread out among the servers.  They want
to avoid the situation we see in EQ2, where less than a week after launch,
they are offering transfers to get people to switch servers.

It's an interesting move...but also annoying for people who are trying to
get on the same server as their friends, if that server fills up before they
get there.

Probably the best approach for now is what a friend of mine did.  He just
created characters with the names he wants, not caring what servers they are
on (or what race and class they are, for that matter), just to hold the
names, and also bought the new "Seinfeld" DVD set.  He's watching that.
He'll go back to WoW after things settle down, and recreate his characters.

EQ1 has a login queue.
