I used to shout train a lot.  Then I learned to strafe run from mobs.
This techinique saved my lowbie butt a hundred times... but the
problem is, its -barely- faster than the mobs, and you can't type
while holding down the strafe keys at all.  In fact strafe plus
escape has a similar effect to hitting /q!

Given that I'm often using it for runs of sizable distance, I tend to
get groupmates asking what is going on, if I'm ok, so on and
so forth... and I"m silent as a church mouse.  Why?  Because
if I let go long enough to type "fine, just strafe running, can't
talk" the mob catches up with me and slips in enough extra
damage to slow my strafing efforts down to his speed, or
stuns me and lets his buddies catch up, or otherwise ruins
my day.

I don't have space on my hotkey bar for /shout training %t to zone,
and shouting by actually typing it in is right out.

IF I happen to have SOW or Tboots up and don't need the
speed boost of strafe on top of that (which I still do oft as
not since I'm generally wounded enough to slow SOW down
to still lunchmeat velocity) I'll shout train as a courtesy.
But the simple fact is I'm training to the nearest zone by the
most direct route and anyone in the flight path should
be aware that they are on train tracks and keep their
eyes peeled and their bowstrings dry.

You would not believe, at level 51, how often I'm called
on to res people near the SS zone in CS, who are busy
complaining about being trained.  Level 12, level 50,
they just don't seem to have learned.

One exception would be zones like Karnors and
City of Mist, which have dual zone lines.  If everyone
would always turn to the right when approaching
the pairs, you'd have a relatively safe area to zone in
to and med at, going in each direction.  When I'm
in DL or KC or EJ or COM, I make a point of
slapping this message on a social and mashing it
periodically as seems appropriate.  Makes an
improvement, but gosh, I still have to res people
who get trained for sitting on the wrong side or by
someone who went the wrong way.  Probably
bloody euros!
