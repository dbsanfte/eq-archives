Heh - update on this.  In the course of the "discussion" (it has
stayed fairly civil) there was some dispute over this, so the following
was demonstrated in game.  A level 1 rogue with *1* point in UMD
can cast level 5 spells.  In 3e a level 1 rogue with maxed UMD has
a 5 percent chance of casting a level 1 spell and a 50% chance
of misfire.

BioWare is on record as being opposed to serious consequences to failure.
Add to that they allow the player to "Take 20" instead of actually rolling
removes all risks.

Some folks have suggested tieing the way UMD works to the difficulty 
slider.  Easy - works the way it does now all the way up to having
it work exactly like it does in 3e.  

In much the same way that someone created the HCR to make play in
their modules approach PnP more accurately, some folks are trying
to implement a hak pak to dramatically increase the cost of spell
scrolls.  Since a wizard only needs 1, this doesn't hurt them as
much as the folks abusing UMD.

Like you, I simply ignore UMD.  I also use the Stone of recall
very infrequently while I'm plaing the OC.
