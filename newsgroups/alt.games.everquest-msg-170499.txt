I'm a guild leader of an Ideal Guild.  Ideal or not (I think it's a poor
choice of phrase when many raid guilders would consider THEIR guild "ideal")
it's hard work to keep going smoothly.  And even though it's going pretty
smoothly there's still the Same Old Issues that EVERY guild leader can
relate to.

That is, "I can't find a guild group."  "I'm want my epic."  "I think we
should use another system to divvy up loot...ours is unfair!"

(answers are, respectively, "make one," "Cool, schedule raids," and "tough
shit, we are NOT going to go /random and we are NOT going to DKP.")

What I think sucks is that Raid Guilds don't thank us for training their new
folks. :p  (loot or cash will do :) )
