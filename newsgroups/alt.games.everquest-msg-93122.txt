First off, I'll admit this much...  When I first started my main character,
I made a huge mistake... LOL... Got a Half-Elf Druid...  I chose him simply
because I wanted to start out in Qeynos, where a friend (who, by the way, no
longer plays the game... LOL) was, so we can hunt together...  Humans are
blind at night, so the only other choice was Half-Elf... I was new to the
game (so was he), so didn't want to make a huge trip...

Anyway, that said, I still like my character.  In spite of his handicaps,
I've done rather well with him, and don't really want to start over with
him... 39 levels is a long way... LOL...

But, here's my quandry...  I want to do some form of tradeskill with him,
but, being a Half-elf, much is closed to him.  Verant has decreed that
Half-elves have no culture of their own, and can't create anything
cultural...  Either something unique to their race, or of elven or human
cultural items.  This is a major bummer...  So, pretty much, tailoring and
smithing is right out.  I can -wear- 'em, just can't make 'em...

Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for what tradeskill to work up?
I've been thinking of Pottery, but I don't know if there's much advantage in
that... although it is nice of Verant to finally make firing sheets
stackable... :)
