Why is "shit" considered more inappropriate than "poop" or "crap"? Why
is "fuck" considered worse than "screw"? Most people won't look twice
if you're in trouble and say "I'm screwed" with kids present. But just
listen to them scream if you replace "screwed" with "fucked". They
mean the exact same thing... Why is one less appropriate than the
other?

It seems to me an arbitrary labelling of certain words as "vile" and
"evil". I see no logic behind it aside from giving certain people an
excuse to shun those who use the words and play all high and mighty
holier-than-thou.
