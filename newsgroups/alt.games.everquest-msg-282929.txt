FYI, going the Dark Elf route is the expensive way. One of the relatively
common fishing results in in Abysmal Sea is Kutin's Key, which you can
turn in for a LORE NO DROP potion of troll form. That's how my iksar monk
got his OT hammer, and he's still very KOS in iksar form...

If you're a bard or rogue, you're probably going to have a Mask of the
Deceiver for clicky Dark Elf form.
