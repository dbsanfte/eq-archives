Oh we may still be discussing his original topic, but I think he was
just tossing off an observation and has probably moved on by now, or is
wondering why we are still going on about it.  Thats how I read his post
actually, sort of a George Carlin/Andy Rooney type thing where you say
"ever notice....", nothing more.  I thought he captured it well too, I
didn't see it as preachy, but maybe thats because I am not one to spend
my time complaining about whats wrong with the game.  Of course thats
cause in my opinion, its the players not VI that are to blame for 90% of
the problems I  have with EQ and a fair percentage of that 90% I can
solve by getting away from folks who are no fun to be around.

I appreciate you not taking what I said as an attack on you, since it
wasn't.  I was just commenting on that whole "you are a VAK" crowd and
how silly I found it, not relating my remarks to you since I've seen you
on both sides depending on the issue and take you to be a moderate in
looking at VI.  I try to be the same, but I have a very long history
with the games development going back to before there was any real
game(pre alpha days) and pretty high regard for what they have
accomplished.  That is tempered by my disappointment with Brad for still
not releasing the game he used to talk about, but maybe someday he'll
get around to that <EG>.
