I disagree. I rather like the fact that the players themselves can do
something that makes a lasting difference. If some people miss out on
some PhAt L3WtZ, well, too bad.

I would really like to see a few more "one-off" quests like this one,
even if I never get to participate. I understand that having a fully
dynamic world is either impossible, or non-conducive to fun, but a few
things here and there that give the semblance of change are very
welcome.
