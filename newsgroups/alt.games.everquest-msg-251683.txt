This sounds like the guy my husband's Rogue and my Paladin were grouped with
in Kurn's the other day on TT.

A cleric who didn't have all his spells and no undead spells he was level 13
when we started grouping with him that means he didn't have ward undead
(level 5)

He was tanking and didn't want to want to do his heal cause it only did 10
hps.  I pulled two mobs (on purpose) and he yells train.  He had ok gear but
goes on to tell us he has 20 k in bank and his highest character is 30ish.
I asked how he did it knowing the answer already, just by the style of play.

Thankfully he logged after about 30mins, we continued on and got in a good
group.  He came back about an hour later and was shouting out in zone out
characters names, and sending me tells.  He was very frustrating.  Wouldn't
take no for an answer.

We ended up logging to other characters to get away from him because he
added us to friends list, and I've found ignore doesn't work for the smart
player cause they'll just keep logging on other characters and message you
from them.

I wish there was a way if you have a problem with someone harassing you from
multiable characters (I've had it happen before a guy stalked me in game,
but thats another story).  I wish you could /ignore playername (all
characters) or something like that without taking up 8 slots of ignore.
