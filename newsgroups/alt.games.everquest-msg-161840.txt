    That's not all. I spotted the expansions thing when I was crashed out of
the zone, but logging cleared that problem.

    What logging did NOT clear was the regular XP bar, which had been
previously not full, which was now at full XP. Trying to gain XP to ding was
fruitless. Since the game thinks I can't possibly be level 64, it shows the
XP bar of a level 60 character - and with the amount of XP I have, that bar
is at full. Seeing the bar full like that is what convinced me that if I
died, I would drop down to a level I didn't want to drop to. And sure
enough, when the GM /kill'ed me I went to 60.

    I got VERY lucky that I didn't die that night, lose the levels, and have
no way to prove to a GM what level I'd been. Right as I was figuring out
"hey, I'm bugged", people pulling corpses to zone brought a small train. My
heal on a party member brought aggro, I was knocked down to half life fairly
fast, and people in my group told me to "zone it, Del". So I run to the
zone-out (a rock in the corner of the room) and click on it.

    And get moved back to the center of the room, which is the zone-in
point. The server still didn't think I had PoP, and wouldn't zone me out to
a PoP zone (PoTranq). Oh, since I didn't zone aggro wasn't cleared, either.

    So, for the next five minutes until stuff was controlled, I would run
one circuit of the room, click on the rock, get moved to the middle of the
room, run one circuit of the room, etc, stopping every so often to drop a
Supernal Remedy (1.8 sec casting time) on one of the combattants so they
didn't all die and leave me to die. Glad my bind point is The Nexus, so I
was able to Gate out of there in the end.

    I'm doing far too much kiting in PoP. Trains from others, adds that
can't be rooted, and on one raid over the weekend the four main adds (each
doubled for 900+) around and around a big arena while a demi-god was being
killed. Supernal Remedy is the best taunt I've ever seen! My dwarf cleric is
doing so much kiting that she's started saying "DOO-DAD" on raids (5 points
for naming the reference).
