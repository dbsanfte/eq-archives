Anyone know what faction the Coldain dwarves are in
the Crystal Caverns?

I have killed giants and I am now amiable to the Coldain
in Thurgadin and the ones in ES and the Great Divide but
the ones in Crystal Caverns are still dubious to me.

Anyone know what the name of the faction is or how to raise it?

BTW the crystal caverns is a beautiful looking dungeon and
the music in the dwarf town down there is cool. Give it a look
if you haven't already.
