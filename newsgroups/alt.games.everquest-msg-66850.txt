And let's not forget the unforgivable sin of not making it compatible with
my old 8088.  I mean, heck, plop in my 5.25 disk, connect to Verant with my
300 baud modem, and prepare for all that EGA creamy goodness.  If it was
good enough for King's Quest II, it's surely good enough for Ever Quest (not
even a II after it, so it can't be as intensive).
