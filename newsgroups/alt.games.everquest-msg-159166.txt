That was a seriously nice thing for him to do.  I remember waaaay back when
I was a young cleric in Oasis and I had not a plat to my name.  One guy just
up and gives me a Serrated Bone Dagger - no strings attached.  I sold for
300pp and bought a Screaming Mace and a bunch of banded armor and it made a
big difference in my gameplay.  It's moments like that that will make you
feel good about how nice people can be.

That's very nice of you.  ^_^  Well done you.  I should do more of that.
Alas that these days a lot of my stuff is no-drop.

My new shield replaced a Prelate's Lantern... I should see about doing
something similar with it.  My real problem has always been distinguishing
the true newbies from the twinks.  I'd hate to give the lantern to someone
who would just give it to his main to sell.

What I do every once in a while is run to the Field of Bone and spend a
couple of hours buffing and healing Iksar newbies.  Monual spent 8-15 in FoB
and I still have fond memories of the place.  This got much easier to do
with PoP because the Cabilis portal in PoK deposits you right in the FoB,
not far from the newbie ramp.

Thanks for the story; it's good to see people talking about nice things that
have happened to them and nice things they've done in return rather than the
usual kvetching about kill-stealing and training.
