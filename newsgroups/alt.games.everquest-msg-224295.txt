  I told this to Lenny several times lately.  And being a good lad, he does as
he is told.  But it doesn't seem to faze whatever is beating on him at the
time.  He's tried it against both living and undead mobs, and against casters
and melee, but it just doesn't seem to matter.  He falls, he continues to get
beat on until I say "Hey stupid, it didn't work.  Stand up!"

   I know that I've heard that feign doesn't work if the mob is mid cast on the
target, but that hasn't been the issue.  Does it not work if the mob is mid
melee swing?  I seem to remember that my necro could feign things off of her
reliably pretty much all the time, while Lenny has never had it work.

   So has there been a nerf, or are me missing something obvious?
