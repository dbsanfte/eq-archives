Of course, maybe some people just like Macs. They're not forcing you to
use one if you don't want to...

Actually, something that hasn't come up in this thread: At the moment,
the Mac port of EQ looks to be Mac-only. As in, yes, they get their own
("ghetto") server. Or possibly a couple of servers, if the demand is
there (who knows). So they will have plenty of room. :)

Additionally, they'll be in Shadowbane too - SB has for a very long time
been announced for Mac as well, as an in-house development as far as I
know. SWG hasn't been announced for Mac yet, but they're looking at it.

Cheers,
Jock
