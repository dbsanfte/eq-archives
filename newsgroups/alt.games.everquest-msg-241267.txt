The expansions are:

Ruins of Kunark - introduces Iksar, increases level cap to 60, lots of
                  nice zones for levels 1-60

Scars of Velious - no new features, but a lot of nice zones for levels
                   about 25-65

Shadow of Luclin - Introduces Vah Shir, beastlords and alternate
                   advancement, has some of the most popular
                   low-to-mid level experience zones and adds the
                   Nexus for easier travel, has the Bazaar where
                   players sell things to other players

Planes of Power - Adds the Plane of Knowledge, for quick travel (much
                  faster than the Nexus), increases level cap to 65,
                  adds more alternate advancement.  All zones except
                  PoK are for level 46+, but once you get to that
                  level they start being by far the fastest places to
                  level up.

Legacy of Ykesha - Introduces Frogloks as a playable race, has zones
                   for about level 35-60

Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Adds "instanced dungeons", where groups get
                           their own private version of a dungeon and
                           a mission to perform therein.  For levels
                           20-65.  Has the best gear that you can get
                           without raiding.

Gates of Discord - Introduces the Berserker class. Adds zones mostly
                   for level 60+, though Abysmal Sea is useful for any
                   level and you can fight in Natimbi from the high
                   40s, I think.

All but the last two are included in Everquest Evolution.  All but LoY
and GoD are pretty much must haves for anyone, I'd say, though Velious
isn't much use until you get to level 30 or 35 or so, and all PoP
offers before 46 is fast travel, but in practice that travel is very
important.

I'm sure someone will correct me if I forgot anything.


> and also what is everquest 2?

Everquest 2 is a new game in development from Sony that has very
little to do with Everquest except for being set in Norrath.


> is that the one for the PS2 thats coming out soon?

No, that is Everquest Online Adventures and whatever the expansion is
called.


> is it worth buying more expansions or do you think that alot of

Everquest 2 is not designed to take players from Everquest, and though
it will certainly take some people away, I expect World of Warcraft
will have a bigger impact.  And if you're going to play EQ, you really
want most expansions (see above).
