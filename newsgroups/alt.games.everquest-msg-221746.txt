    Well, I'm definitely a mudflation victim, in fact being that I started
Kul in sep last year, a heavily mudflated economy was the state of affairs
from day one.

    Of course I didn't get luclin until level 33 and didnt enter the bazaar
until my 40's (had no money), so I was wearing stuff that had dropped in
groups until then.

    In fact, I had several pieces of darkforge armour on that I had fought a
terrible personal battle to gain - I could almost never get other people to
do the lizards in feerott with me so I ended up soloing them for several
pieces, in my 30's. The lay of the land there makes fear kiting kind of
difficult, and I didn't even know fear kiting existed then, so I was
straight-up toe-to-toe soloing mobs that hit harder than I did and had more
hitpoints than me, were a few levels below me and had many friends.

    Needless to say, when I finally got into the bazaar and realised I could
buy *Better* gear with *less* time invested, let alone the fact that the
very gear I was so desperately questing was available for sale for (some
pieces) 50pp per slot... I was a little dissillusioned. In fact, I have
point blank refused to do quests (generally) ever since. Now on rare
occasions where I do one, I read every little step of the way first, looking
at the final reward in cold mathematical value terms and making a decision
based on hard data.

    The other thing that really screwed the game sideways for me at that
point was twinking. Between mudflated and twinked characters all around me,
I was perpetually the worst equipped person in any group you could name,
even though I'd probably spent more time getting my gear than the other 5
members combined. None of that would've mattered, except SK's are the (equal
top) most gear dependant class in the game. An SK with mediocre gear does a
mediocre job regardless of how well he plays, and every slot has to be good
as he is both a DPS and a tank class.

    None of this was fatal though, Kuloth's background as a knight of the
dismal rage suited him perfectly at that point, and he returned to high keep
and murdered what had to be around 1,000 guards, sold their fine steel
weapons on the black market and happily ruined his faction with every place
that he had ever held dear. The money from that let him buy a few items that
let him fear kite giants, and from there he began to play catchup on a grand
scale. I'm finished being a sole bazaar twink now though, I now have 6 slots
I personally farmed in a group or duo and at least three more I actually
quested or tradeskiller quested (gathered the ingredients). The stuff I'm
wearing now isn't nodrop but much of it is rarely seen in the bazaar because
the people farming it, wear it.

    What has kept me going for the last 15 levels is the next few hundred
hitpoints, the next few points of stamina and the next few AC points. Every
little tanking increase I get lets my friends see more content and opens our
options to us. I'm now at the point of the game where:

    1) AA's mean enough that twinks don't cut it anymore because gear alone
doesn't make you a good tank. You also see fewer 65 twinks around than lower
levels, they seem to vanish around the high 50's.
    2) The gear I can farm or quest myself *is* comparible with the gear I
can afford in the bazaar. In fact I'm *Selling* extra drops to buy
comparible gear/spells.

    What makes the game cool to me right now is the shaman/SK team. We
always have other people with us now, but being able to form the core of a
successful group every time me and Kremitt are both online makes the game.
That and being part of a powerful team - feeling on top of my game instead
of behind the curve.

    Oh and on the dark side, the words "sorry we're full" to the level 55
twinks from uberguilds or semi uberguilds that would never have grouped with
me ten levels ago, when they come and ask for a slot in our PoV groups at a
level I spent *wishing* I could get into a PoD group. The answer is *no*
boys and girls.

    Where to from here? Well the new guild I'm with looks like doing a fair
bit of serious raiding (by my standards) in the coming months, which is a
new and exciting experience for me, and I've got my eye on some LDoN gear,
although it will take a vast number of missions to get it. (30 successes per
slot!).

    In conclusion, although EQ is obviously a very cool part of my life, I
think some key mistakes have been made, that will, sadly, probably be
repeated. The value of old content, and particularly *quest* gear should
somehow be protected. It wouldn't have taken much for that darkforge amour
to have been good enough until my late 40's, just level restricting or
no-dropping the post 50 drops from the get-go would have done it.

    But the plus side of my journey is that I got to use cloth, leather,
banded, chain, bronze and sol-ro quest gear before EQ turned to boiling mud
for me. The worst part about mudflation is that the guys who start with
access to the bazaar and 1k from their friend who got them into EQ *miss*
all of that. I got to play Kuloth from a weedy little guy who had to
scrounge plague rat tails to buy leather armour from a vendor, to a guy
whose idea of crowd control is "fuck it, I'll just tank 3"

Cheers,
James
