Well what was being referred to in the thread you quoted was rangers
using endless quiver and probably during raid situations.

So for advice for a young ranger - put your bow away for a long long
time. You can't do acceptable damage with it in a group until you are
at least L59 with enough aa to have archery mastery 2 (some say 1, but
you'd have to have weak melee weapons to outdamage your melee with
archery at AM1). Break out those fancy swords or axes or whatever you
have for melee weapons and use those.
