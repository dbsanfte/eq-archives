Well, explain to me how the changes implemented mean that you won't learn 
those things now? As far as I know, the only thing the new, easier 1-10 
levels won't teach you is corpse recovery. Everything else, basic 
mechanics, interaction, etc. will still have to be learned early.

The important thing is that now, you will use those levels to *learn* the 
basics, and come off them ready to play your class as intended, rather 
than spending a few days worth of playing sessions as, say, a 
robe-wearing tank.
