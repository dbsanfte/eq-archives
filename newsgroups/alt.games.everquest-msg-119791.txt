Did you actually click "combine" on the bag? It changes the bag
from, for example, "a bat wing collectors sack" to "a bag full
of bat wings" - while in the real world this would still be the
same item the NPC only wants it back once combine has been
clicked. The bag becomes a new object and stops being a bag,
essentially.
