You need those classes for for 'locate' corpse.. he asked about
TRACKING  a corpse!

Yes.. a ranger can 'track' corpses under those circumstances.
My ranger has done it PLENTY of times!!
The dead group member's 'corpse' will show up on tracking list, if
they zone back in it will disappear and I would be only able to track
them not their corpse.
You also have to been in the zone they died in without leaving it.
If you leave zone and come back even though the person that died
didn't come back to zone yet then you won't be able to track their
corspe.

Keep in mind that doesn't always work though.
Some zones it works better in then others.
My ranger once tracked a corpse clear across to the other side of
Western Karana once.. range isn't a problem ;-)
