I really hope they dont move the entrance, and its really great that it is
never crowded. The place is psychadelic, and i wish to keep it that way. I
don't want "uber n00b_01" running around shouting everywhere "train to here"
and "train to there" etc. This zone is for the few who have the power to get
there, and it should stay that way. I love this zone the way it is..... i
really hope they don't change it much. This zone is kinda like "a game
within a game" itself. I'll give the designers 100 points on a scoreboard
rating from 1 to 10 for this zone and its current content. It's awesome and
original... WTG!

PS: Save us from the n00bs plz! Say NO to relocating to entrance!
