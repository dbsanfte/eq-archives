That's, um, quite bizarre to my (admittedly somewhat drunk atm) thinking.
Guess I'll have to conduct an experiment next time I'm bored.

I can well relate to the hot-key whacking though - slow graphics card, PB
AE, whack the hell out of the keyboard whilst screaming 'refresh, dammit,
refresh'. :)

How I miss the aggro on Staff of Temp Flux before it was nerfed (*cough* I
mean balanced) - snare the mob, SoTf like crazy, kite it around until the
tanks finally manage to beat it to death.  Now, that was a useful
contribution to the group. And fun...

Stuns and interrupt nukes (like Thunder Strike) do seem to have a pretty
large aggro value though compared to normal nukes - 2 draughts = np, stun +
draught = hope concussion sticks. I guess mobs really don't like being
interrupted :).

Well, yes, you are a caster, but sub-20 I'd say melee was still an option
for even a pure caster if you can't do anything else useful. Much after
that, you'd be lucky to land a hit at all, and when the mobs get riposte
it's a severely bad idea...
