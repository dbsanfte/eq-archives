Yes. Yes. Except the Erudites. What the bloody hell is with those
heads? They're not even cone-shaped, they're more peanut-shaped.

I am disappointed with STILL being unable to change beard colors on
most races. Some of the hair colors could use some work - the red is
just TOO pure red. Tone it down with a little brown.

I'm also disappointed with the lack of Velious armor textures,
although I understand that would increas memory requirements beyond
