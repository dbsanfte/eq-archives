You can't. You need the keys :)

If you don't like running to the store you are going to have to have a
credit card anyways right? Since you don't want to run and get a playing
card..... And since you HAVE a credit card you can order the whole game (go
for the EQ Gold pack) online from any good game site.

You don't have to leave the house.... and since the full game is 2 Gbyte+ it
might get there sooner if you opt for next day delivery :)
