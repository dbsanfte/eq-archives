Access to a guild chat populated by friends, message boards,  help on
quests, easy grouping and what have you.    All of the benefits of being in
the guild, save raid loot drops.

And in some guilds, allowance to attend at said raids. (The raids could be
limited to members and prospective members only.)  Most likely preferential
treatment if a drop is going to rot.  One would assume they would give it to
the member not meeting the 60% before having a non member guest loot it.

Correct.    I think it's a much harsher policy, and I would be much less
interested in joining a guild that had an expulsion policy rather than a "no
loot" policy for poor attendance, but it is still a valid policy.

Glad to hear it.

No, the thing that is stupid, self-serving, unfair and hypocritical as well,
would be the people who agree with and agree to an attendance policy during
the period they are attending all the raids, then cry unfair when they get
"other interests" sufficient that they no longer want to attend lots of
raids.   Suddenly they believe everything should be open roll with
attendance granting no advantages.

(If you're still arguing that it's just your friend that fell below, then
you can drop the self-serving, and stick with stupid, unfair and
hypocritical.)

And before you ask, the people it would be unfair to would be everyone that
made extra effort to attend raids and remain above 60%, just to have the
rules changed and removed because your friend decided he no longer wanted to
make the effort to remain qualified.

If this guy is such a good friend of yours, why tell him to beat it and get
lost, he's not good enough to hang around with your guild?

And instead fucked over all of your other friends in the guild?

Both of which are valid options.  It would be unfair to change the policy,
but if the people effected are fine with it, that ceases to be an issue.
And you always have the option of leaving the guild over your friend's
situation.   Maybe you can even convince him to come with you.

Fair to whom?


(Meaning, "fair" just to your friend, or fair to the guild as a whole?)

They can actively look for another guild to join whether they have left or
not.    Even among the most uber guilds, I have not yet heard of secret
police who will break your kneecaps if you even think about leaving.
Especially if there is a valid, identifiable reason for the possible
departure.

Aye.   If your friends aren't going to play at that level, they should be
smart enough to choose to quit.   Unless of course they believe that the
other benefits of remaining a member outweigh it.
