What is a good Christmas present for an Everquest addict?

Maybe theres a mouse or something that makes playing the game easier? I
remember there used to be an "RPG" controller for Super Nintendo that
was designed for easy one handed play. I realize EQ is much more
complex, but maybe there is something similar? I saw a "Z-board"
keyboard insert, but it didn't look very useful.

Any other ideas for some sort of accessory for someone who plays EQ a
ton? I'd rather not buy them anything that is in-game (such as weapons
or virtual cash).

Thanks!
