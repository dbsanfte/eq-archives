I'd like to challenge the consensus with a question and an observation
based on a recent experience.  Let me know where my assumptions are
wrong.

During a recent Vox raid, we were told to take run off as well as any
movement buffs, so that when (not "if") we were feared, we wouldn't
travel as far.   Having then spent a good  chunk of the next 10 min
running away (note to self: increase MR), I can appreciate the advice.

The same held true for the slippery slopes going up to Frenzy in
Velk's.  If I was running I'd be hosed.

So wouldn't Run3 interfere with this strategy?  I thought a lot of
higher end mobs do have AE fears, or similar, and I was wondering if
it may be more advantageous to skip the Run3, and buy a Horse or
something.

Now, I have no idea what else to spend them on, (hmmm...MR?), but I
was thinking of skipping it.
