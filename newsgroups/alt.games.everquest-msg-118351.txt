Other people can do things differently. For example - right now, I am
replying to you, but the intended audience is whoever cares enough to read,
which by this stage I imagine to very few indeed ; )

Part of the frustrating thing about using a public forum is that not
everyone does things the same way - or the correct way even if we assume
there is one correct way. There are even some people like me who aren't
overly concerned about doing stupid things, which, given the frequency they
occur, is proberly a very good thing indeed.
