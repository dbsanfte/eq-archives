Yep, that's the question.  And the answer is "Yes."  Throw in
the "it's (perhaps) not the smartest thing in the world to try"
if you want, but the *answer* is "Yes" (along with "No, it
doesn't only work on buffs.  It works on any magic-based effect.")
The OP didn't mention getting beat on, for one thing.  I've fought
*plenty* of things with my cleric (solo) without EVER getting beat
on.  And you can bet that I'd want to dispell a root so I can
keep moving backwards when "root-kiting" a mob...

But look at a example: you fight a ghoul by trying the root/nuke
routine.  He returns the favor by rooting you.  Can/should you
dispell the root, if you've had the foreknowledge to make sure
it's in the first slot on you?   Maybe your mana would be better
off spent trying to nuke him to death (and hoping your root
doesn't break before his does.)  But maybe he's rooted you while
you were pulling him to a safe area and you don't want to stay
there.  It - like most things - is situational and, yes, it's
a valid tactic to make sure things like that land in the first
slot so you can dispell it if you need/want to.
