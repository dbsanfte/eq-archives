...or before it rots.  Items left on the ground evaporate after
five minutes.

Another approach is to place the items in a "tradeskill container", like
an oven, forge, pottery wheel, kiln, or loom.  Items left in
such containers will remain there indefinitely, which means that
you won't be screwed if you have thirty minutes worth of
connection problems while trying to switch characters (unlike
the "leave it on the ground" method).

The only problem is to make sure you use a container that
a passing player won't just happen to want to use while you're
switching characters.  If you scout around, you can find
out-of-the-way tradeskill device that will be unlikely to
be used by anyone.

If you want an almost-certain-to-be-unused drop spot,
I'd like to recommend the underwater chest in the lake
in Oasis.  Not only will no one be wanting to use it
for tradeskills (it's not a tradeskill device), but
very few people have even seen or heard about it in the
first place.  It's just underwater on the edge of the
Spectre island (another reason most people have never
run across it), under the canoe that's parked at
the bottom of the ramp.  Don't worry, it's out of aggro
range of the Spectres.  Just open it, place your stuff in
there, then have your other character come pull the items
out.  Plus you'll feel like a pirate.  Arrrr....
The only catch is your characters have to be not so
low level that they'll die making the trip to and across
Oasis.

WARNING:  You *can* place No Drop items into tradeskill
containers (and the Oasis chest), BUT they will poof
the moment you close the container, so don't try it.


>I'd really recommend asking a friend to hold it though.

I agree.  Only use the above methods if you really
haven't found anyone you can trust.

Also, the above methods can not be used for transferring
cash to another character, to do that you *have* to
hand it from player to player.  (The alternative is to
buy gems with the cash and transfer the gems to the
other character (who then sells it back to the vendor
for cash), but you always lose a certain percentage
in such transactions).
