Heh, yeah, it sure is. What's sad is that I've *wanted* to be bitten by 
that bug but all the other MMORPGs are just so...blah..that it never 
happened. It is a sad state when you want to spend good money on a 
MMORPG but can't find one and you have to go back to one that has been 
around for 5 years. Hopefully the publishers will see that the same 
tired old formulas but with prettier graphics aren't going to cut it 
anymore.
