I somehow seriously doubt those were the guide's exact words. More
likely, he said it was because he _COULD HAVE_ voluntarily logged out
of the game... Which is true, there is no way they can prove you did
not. Awarding rezzes for everyone who claims to have gone LD through
no fault of their own would have swarms of people pulling the plug in
a bad fight then begging for rezzes...
