Epic is usually not used in grp cause of the long casting time and its a 3
plus min dot which is a waste - if ya have a cleric in grp give over the
heals to him/her and be sure to debuff each mob - in certain places snare is
required - if no chanter root parking is good if ya tell the grp to move
away from it but remember it will come straight for you when it breaks.

Druid 9 plus kazad is better than virtue for almost all classes - every raid
ive been on in my guild does mass 9 plus symbol - then goes back and virtue
the few who need it. If you have a cleric in grp tell him/her to symbol and
you cabbage if thats all ya got.

Druid dots in a fast grp is a waste of mana IMO, and can get you uneeded
agro if you attempt to sit to med ( indoors, invest the 10k for a horse for
outdoors ).

See druids grove or eqdruids for lots of druid tips
