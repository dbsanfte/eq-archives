Just remember your job is to heal. Dont melee or cast damage, unless you
have the mana to spare. DONT melee or cast damage, then expect the party to
wait around while u med up. Dont worry about combat skills, except defense.
Defense is free ac, so you may as well have it. Also dont heal people up to
full, then announce oom. A lot of clerics seem to have trouble with the
concept of natural regeneration.

As for reducing agro, best to heal at the ends of fights that near the
beginning. Sitting further from the monster helps a bit.
