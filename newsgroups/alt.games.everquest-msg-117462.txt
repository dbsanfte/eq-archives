I am a Druid of 41 Summers with a Tracking Skill of 125 (Max).  Once I saw a
corpse on my Tracking Screen but I don't remember the circumstances.  This
time, I was standing next to the group members corpse and could not see it!
I cast a Lessor Succor and this corpse of course was left behind.  Would
that constitute leaving the zone and prevent me from seeing the coupse?
