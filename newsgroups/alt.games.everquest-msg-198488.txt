Well, I guess it's my turn to be locked out.  Since the last patch
yesterday (Friday May/16/03) I can't log on to either production or
testside.  The first few times I tried I crashed to desktop at the
character selection screen, now when I log on my cursor is stuck in
the upper lefthand corner at the EULA screen.  I can't window out of
it.  I end up having to cut power on my computer to get anywhere.

   So, anyone have any advise for me?  I'm in a hotel for the next two
weeks at least, and was really looking forward to getting back in the
game.  Thanks in advance for any ideas anyone might have.

Annie
