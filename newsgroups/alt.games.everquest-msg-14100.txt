Your choices:

1)  Save up as many belts as you can hold in the bank, then run to see
Canloe Nusback in the Kaladim warrior guild.  You can give him 4 at a time
for experience, faction, a little change and an item usually worth about a
gold.  Even at level 16 belts may be worth it if you get them fast enough
(probably buy).

2) Sell them to other players for cash.   Attempt to sell them for 1p each
and hope that the buyer doesn't know about the recent change.  If you can't
find anyone ignorant of it, sell them for 5g each (perhaps less now).

I have always picked choice #1, but I'm also constantly broke (my level 52
enchanter has 300p...my 50 druid has 4000p) so if you're interested in, or
need cash, #2 might be best for you.
