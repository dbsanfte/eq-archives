This should change when you hit the higher teens and some of the missions
require more in the way of tactics. I know that there have been several
missions I've encountered in the last couple of days that we could not
complete with groups ranging from 2-8, after trying many different tactical
variations. Last night we gave up on one, deciding (after significant debt
incurred) to come back and try after a few more levels (fortunately, the
missions retain their difficulty setting based in part on the level of the
Hero when acquiring it, so you can come back later and it will be easier).
And then there were those that we finally figured out after a couple of
tries. I have to admit, I've been pleasantly surprised and impressed at each
level with how much deeper the game gets even as I wonder (as you do) how
long it can keep my interest.

LOL this will definitely change.

Yeah, that was a nice suprise, eh? Don't have to stop, turn and cast. It's
saved my ass countless times.

By the way, it is disappointing to learn that an Empathy healer cannot heal
himself directly isn't it? Fortunately, there is almost no heal aggro that I
can see and so I've been able to stand in the middle of raging battles and
rely entirely on my 100hp Healing Aura. This only gets to be a problem when
I'm using Absorb Pain in a pinch and have to wait for the reset time to be
able to heal myself. But in practice, I don't think I've died once yet due
to Absorb Pain, and Healing Aura has taken good care of me. Hope that
continues.
