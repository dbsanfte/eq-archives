I don't think that will do you any good, Mark. :(  You still have to a valid 
Sony Station account that has been approved for beta in order to play. 
Doesn't matter if you have the software, at some point you're required to 
log in to your Sony Station account to play and only those accounts which 
have been approved for beta get past the login screen.

If in fact there is going to be an open beta, then it's probably going to 
start *very* soon, so hang in there and keep checking back.
