Sorry about that.  It should be updated soon.

The book is about the history of the game and its genre, the community 
around it, and the controversy that has been caused.  It's very much an 
examination of EverQuest in microcosm.

(And, by the way, if "Just Me" or "Tarre Soulskin" happen to be reading 
this, please, GET IN TOUCH.  You are entitled to a free book...)

Best to all,

Robert Marks
