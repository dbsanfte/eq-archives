If he's taken ANY character (any class and any race) from 7 to 30+ in one
week we all want to know how he is doing it (other than an IV pumping food
and liquid directly into his blood, catheter, and a few IVs pumping 100%
pure caffeine directly into his heart, or maybe he's an
robot/machine/computer of some kind, or non earth life form).  I can
understand how leveling from 7 to 30+ (even 39) is possible in a week, after
168 hours playing time it might be possible.
