Lol. You carry 'death items' so that going back to your corpse is
unneccesary. And you shouldn't bother blowing all your cash on big
expensive items you will lose shortly anyways. Items in AC1 are easy
to replace at lowbie levels.

In the lowbie years you only drop one or two items with your
corpse...and for the most part you can afford to lose them.

To succeed in Darktide as a lowbie all you had to do was learn to stay
the hell away from town, portals, and other nexus points, and make
your trips into them short and fast. Learn where nearby level
resitricted portals were, stay on top of where the pk guilds were
focussing... make friends, join a guild, and live long and prosper. It
wasn't nearly as bad as you made out.

I found it exhilerating in a way that Rallos Zek never was.
