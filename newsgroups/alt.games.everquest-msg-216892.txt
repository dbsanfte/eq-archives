    Unless you're being overly cautious, and defining every pull near a door
as a potential problem, I agree with the other poster. I don't see how you
can look at a new room and know that there's mobs behind the wall, where you
can't see them. Well, you could own holgresh beads, but that's not exactly
an option for most pullers.

    Hello. I've played the game since 2000, have multiple characters, am in
Time, and am the lead cleric for said Time level guild. You don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, like most monks that think they know best
when it comes to healing. The cleric is the only one that knows how much
mana he has. He may have told you 20m, but that doesn't mean he has 20m. As
the other poster indicated, what that 20m is capable of doing, especially if
there's a single random flaw in the game plan (resisted mez/slow,
tank/slowers lags, etc.), is something that cleric knows because it's their
job to know how many heals, how much mana regen they can expect, and what
sort of DPS they're going to be taking. All YOU know is "well, other clerics
handled pulls of X mobs, and they called the same mana, and I think they had
the same gear, so bombs away!"

    The cleric in the bit he just quoted has just cast a heal - "sitting
down right after a heal". The cleric in the quote also plans to lose between
10 and 20 mana by not sitting down. "Sitting down... is for emergency use"
implies he won't sit.

    Pardon?

    LEVEL 44: Temperance - 800 HPs and 48 AC for 550 mana, duration 1 hour
40 minutes.
    The 3 buffs (Symbol, AoF, Reso) - 638 HPs and 40 AC for 565 mana, first
component drops in 54 minutes, all components down in 1 hour 3 minutes.

    Even when you get to top level effects (the three buffs increase as you
level, Temp is fixed) the three buffs combined don't add up stats-wise to
what Temperance gives. The only time your statement holds true is if you
were going to skip AoF, so you'll have 550 mana versus 425 mana. And in that
case the "paying for duration" is a pretty good deal, considering you get
nearly twice the duration (and half the reagents during that duration) for
25% more mana.

> So, in a rough

    Um, of course it is. But Heroism is a level 52 spell, Temperance is
level 44. The cleric he mentioned was level 50. Which of those two spells
can he cast?

    If you're talking about LDoN adventures, Temperance is the only way to
go. Cast it and med to full before going in, it lasts the entire adventure
and is most efficient over time. Use Symbol, and it drops during the
adventure if you don't finish fast (remember to figure in med time outside
the dungeon before entering). Not smart play.

> Secondly, this adventure is gonna be over soon anyway

    Usually isn't for the low-level groups unless they bring along a lot of
severely twinked people. While an elemental-geared player can laugh at what
is thrown at him during the level 65 adventure, the lower level players
aren't as imbalanced versus their adventure.

    One of my guild's twink necromancers was doing a mid-50's adventure in
Mistmoore, and charmed a mob that was doubling for 160's (I believe 166 was
the exact number quoted). Back when I was grinding out those levels in the
"good old days" in Sebilis, nothing doubled 160 that was part of an XP pull.
This isn't slumming for them.

    There's twinks, and there's twinks. You and I both know the difference
between someone's cheap twink that levelled on no plat mobs (warrior with
Lammy/Razor Edged Shan'Tok), and a serious "OMFG how much is that worth?!?"
twink (Sword of the Bloodsworn/Copper Hammer of Striking/SBoZ/BoC). I think
only the latter will be having a relatively easy time of LDoN.
