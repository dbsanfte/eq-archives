Here's the original point and a restatement of my reply:

start reinstatement --

The "removed" they hybrid penalty, IIRC, by simply
multiplying the amount of XP given in order to make
up for the increased amount of XP required.  A penalty
of 40% more XP required can be balanced simply by
giving 40% more XP for each kill.

They can't do that for hell levels:  the new multiplier
applies to the following levels as well.  So they'd have
to multiply all the XP earned by the amount the
multiplier had jumped, which would drastically reduce
the kills required to level from 30 to 60.

The "logical" way to do that is to fit the levels from 30
to 51 (and probably 26 to 29 as well) into a new curve
that is more of a "curve" than a "staircase."  Here's one
way of doing that [snip]

That's probably a single field for each character, at
least from the explanations I've seen.  Even with
millions of records, computers are VERY fast when
doing math, even floating point, quickly.   We're not
talking hours;   we're talking minutes per server, at
most.

The same thing that happens to any other database
that's being updated when the host crashes.  You use
the rollback procedure and start again if doing batch
work.

As for the "corrupted database," how many times a day
do you guess the average active character earns XP
and updates that field?  ;)

Extract data from file;  run through filter; add to
database.  That's not a nightmare;  that's a simple,
automated task, for any data pulled off tapes prior
to the change.   And, one would hope, they don't
have to do that very often anyway.   And one would
think they'd have full backups, checked for integrity,
prior to beginning any database manipulations.  It's
certainly a potential problem area, of course, but
database moves/restores aren't something they do
lightly anyway.

Well, we're actually in agreement, except you miss the
"where am I now" part of the problem.   With some
made up numbers:

Old curve
29  19,756,800 to 21,950,100, or 2,193,300 total
30  21,950,100 to 26,730,000, or 4,779,900 total
31  26,730,000 to 29,493,090, or 2,763,090 total

New curve
29  20,000,000 to 23,000,000 or 3,000,000 total
30  23,000,000 to 26,300,000 or 3,300,000 total
31  26,300,000 to 29,900,000 or 3,600,000 total

That's just to show the current curve with the "bump"
of a "hell level" and a new, "smooth" curve without it.
But take the character that has 26,500,000, or just
short of leveling into 31 when he logs off before the
servers go down.  When he signs back on, he's now
suddenly 31.  Or the one that signs off at 29,500,000
(just into 32) who signs on and is back in 31.   They've
said that's not going to happen.

IMO, they HAVE to equate current XP to a new curve
and change the database entry for it.
