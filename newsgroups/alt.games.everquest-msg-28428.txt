*shrug* i don't know why it cost me more, I didn't stop
either, though i didn't start on wisdom dieties yet.  I keep
meaning to, but never seem to get around to it.  Been
playing my druid mostly lately, and my rogue is just sort of
chilling out in Halas/everfrost.  Have tried to help a
guildie get a mammoth hide cloak with him lately, so haven't
been adventuring much.
