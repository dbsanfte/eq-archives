My level 24 shaman and level 25 ranger are basically new to groups.  My
boyfriend and I usually play as a team.  He has a wizard to play with my ranger
and a bard to play with either one.  And a shaman to buff my ranger when she's
soloing :). And since we are sitting in the same room there's no need for alot
of keyboard chatter... we simply TELL each other whats going on.  And we
usually do fine :).
We've tried grouping with other people a total of 3 times.
Once at HHP - we were doing just fine as a duo pulling gnolls to the zone and
killing them.  Couple of guys asked to join us... was really stupid.  No REAL
tank in the group - miserable failure.
Once in field of bone -  lower level guy begged us to help him complete a quest
- proceeded to run in a bunch of REDS that we couldn't POSSIBLY kill - another
mistake.
Last time was someone "starting" a group... we sat around for 20 minutes
waiting for other members to join us that were either on their way or hadn't
logged on yet at all... 
Now my BF and I BOTH want to know, how do you find a GOOD group.  (Well, as I 
have read the entire 43 posts on "pulling" what I really want to know is how to
find a good LEADER?)
As a shaman, do i buff or fight?  And if I'm the buffer shouldnt the tanks TELL
me which buffs they want?   Shouldn't the leader DIRECT me as to my part?
As a ranger, I know it will be harder to find a group and I don't want to be a
"mana hog".  I assume if I am agroed I just quit hitting until the monster goes
after the REAL tanks?  And if I'm the puller ... well... again... shoudln't the
leader DIRECT me as to when to pull?  
Now I don't mean FOREVER.  I mean til I get the dynamics of the group down...  
My shaman gets invited to groups alot - my ranger rarely.... and my shaman
NEEDS a group far more than my ranger... when I'm playing alone.  (duh!).
So I guess I am more focused on shaman advice than ranger...
And, lastly, do I tell the Leader that I am new to grouping and need advice,
(seems ridiculous at level 24 plus) or do I just jump in there and possibly do
stupid things?
