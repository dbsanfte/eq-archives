Bard track skill caps at 100, not 75.  Druid track skill caps at 125, not really much more than bard track.  Ranger track skill caps
at 200, which is indeed a big jump over -either- bard or druid track skill range.  I have jokingly claimed in the past that line of
sight is better than bard track range... the truth isn't far from that, but track is 360 degrees and sees thru all obstructions, and
its a lot longer range than the range at which names of mobs are visible; all in all its far far easier to spot mobs with bard track
than with the old mark one eyeball my cleric, shaman, enchanter, and mage all are forced to rely on.  My druid had noticably better
track than my bard, but not markedly better.  Since the person I was responding to was talking up "ranger and druid" track, I
maintain that bard track is worth mentioning in that discussion.
