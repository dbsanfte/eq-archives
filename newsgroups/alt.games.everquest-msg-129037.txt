No, I say that Israelis have killed civilians accidentially.
Collateral damage.  It's a sad fact of war. 

Tragic?? 

Yes..

Terrorism??

Definetly not.

Israel does not specifically target innocent women and children, as
the PA Terrorists do.

A soldier will attack military targets.

A terrorist will attack innocent civilians and non-combatants.

In the former, innocents can, and do, get killed and that is a
tragedy.

In the latter, the POINT of the attack is to kill innocents....
