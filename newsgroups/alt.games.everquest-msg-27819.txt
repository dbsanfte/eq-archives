The WK portal is virtually useless. It's spitting distance from the NK portal.
You'll save almost exactly how long it takes you to zone into WK in terms of
getting to Qeynos.  This is why, to this day, Qeynos is an underutilized,
backwater burg. They either need to move it to the other end of the phucking
zone, or just get it over with and put one in the middle of Qeynos Hills.  It's
one aspect of the game design that still befuddles me to this day. Why make it
such a PITA to get to Qeynos from anywhere else?
