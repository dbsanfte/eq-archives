    Given what happened between one of my fellow guild members and Nullo at
the last Fan Faire I'll concur in the case of FoH. But....

    No, you need people who are unoccupied at all times of the day. They
don't have to be the same people. In our case, our "day crew" includes more
than a few housewives, a Coast Patrol member that can play from work while
waiting for a call, and some college students. By evening most of them have
logged, and the people returning from work log on. www.lotuscult.com - as
you can see, we seem to be doing OK.

    And as a side note, someone from Ben's guild contacted us recently -
apparently they like our web design and want to adapt parts of it
themselves. ;-)
