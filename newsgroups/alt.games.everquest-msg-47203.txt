In any event they are one of the most needed classes for certain
higher level mobs, thereby solidifying their need in high level
guilds.

One that I can think of right off the bat that is not even in an uber
area but which wizards are pretty indispensable for is the dragon
Gorenaire in Dreadlands. I know that my guild does not even try it
unless we have the wizards on,  who can usually do 12k damage to it
total all at once.

The fact that they are also the only class to get you to hate or sky
makes them a bit needed also ;)

I certainly hope to hell that my druid never gets TL, that would just
be one other CS spell I'd have other players begging for. If I was a
wizard I'd never even buy the TL's.
