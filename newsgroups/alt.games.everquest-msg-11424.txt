just for a bit of clarity on the /loc (/l works too)
1st number is N/S, + is north of some arbitrary grid point (0, 0, 0), - is
south
2nd number is E/W, + is east of said arbitrary grid point, - is west
3rd is altitude, + is above said arbitrary 'ground level', - is below it,
not much use usually in outdoor zones, but real usefull in multi-level,
same-zone dungeons
