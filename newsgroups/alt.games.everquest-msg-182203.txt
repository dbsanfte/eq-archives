As mentioned a GM wont acknowledge a "camp" so it's really up to the
players.  Usually the first one there gets it, until they leave or they work
something out with the other group.  Usually there are many other "camps"
available and other group will "camp" that until the first group leaves.
There are times where all this is completely not applicable.  Not everyone
cares about your camp so don't be shocked when ppl squat all over camp.

"First to force" gets the mob.  When servers reset (or patch), all the big
spawn come back so whoever can get the ppl there first gets the mob. Like
many others, Lodizal (for example) lasts about 2 mins on any given sever
before he dies.

No set protocol, but most ppl play nice and share, but when there is a good
drop, reward, etc. up for grabs sometimes it's no hold barred.

Good Luck.
