Not sure how it holds up in the uber raid level, but the addition of cease
and desist (mainly cease, though, since desist usualy doesn't cast in time)
has helped Paladins greatly.  Add to that, Instrument of Nife, and Paladins
got a real boost with Luclin (and let's not forget the new rez line).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
