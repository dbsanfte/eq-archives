Not sure if this is common with beastlord or if I just have a dumb
pet.  Once in a while when I'm fighting with a group, my pet would run
off unexpectedly and fight another.  On a few occasions it has trained
in several mobs.

I was doing an LDoN run with 2 other beastlords, dwarf warrior, monk,
and a cleric.  While we were dealing with 2 mobs, my pet just ran off
and then came back a few minutes later with 8 on his tail.

I died there.  The warrior died.  The 4 other were able to get out.
Ouch...

Is there such thing as a pet leash in EQ world?  or a better way of
controlling the pet?  I have tried theats, tried the sit command (it
doesn't fight even if I'm under fire but once it moves, it forgets the
sit command), guard (it still often run off if I'm pulling even if
it's not supposed to)

But I don't want to give it up.  It's indispensible, almost like a
disposable tank if I really need to get away.
