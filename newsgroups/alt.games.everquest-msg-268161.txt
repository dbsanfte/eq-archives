The effect will be, since they didn't go through the 'correct channels' 
to create the group, there's about 100 self appointed netcops that will 
start issueing repeated 'kill group' commands in the control groups as 
soon as they see it pop up.

So it will be almost impossible to get it created and propagated.

At least that's what happened to a friend of mine.

Technically it's also 'without charter' but how many people read a 
charter anyway?
