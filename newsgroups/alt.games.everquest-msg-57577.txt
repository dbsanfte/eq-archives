Playing a bard as my primary, I still have to agree with ya...  Now,
granted, a Bard, with the -right- equipment (and know-how) can be a -decent-
melee, and an excellent puller... However, Bards are -not- tanks...  Never
were meant to be.  In this case, I'd still stick with the monk, as any monk
worth his salt can single-pull very well, and dish out quite a bit of
damage.
