  I'm going to wait and see what other people think of it.

  My worry is that for a Star Wars game to really be a Star Wars game, it
has to incorporate a lot of different facets of the Star Wars universe
successfully... lightsaber duels, blaster firefights, aerial combat, space
combat, multiple colorful means of travel (speeders, fighters, capital
ships, mounts), conveying the impression of freedom in a huge galaxy, a
convincing manifestation of the Force and Jedi's that is simultaneously
powerful and balanced, ect.  Though all of this has been done with varying
degrees of success in other games, never has it been done in a MMORPG, and
that adds a huge layer of complexity on top of it all.  Verant does have a
lot of experience with developing and running an MMORPG, but a lot of that
knowledge probably can't be directly applied to a project like SWG (in the
same way that it might be able to be applied to, say, EQ2.)

  So I fear that SWG will either completely omit some of the features
mentioned above, or implement them so poorly that the game on the whole
suffers for it.  Also, Verant knows that they can count on a huge number of
players solely on the basis of the game's name, and who knows how much
they'll be counting on that to draw in players and keep them, as opposed to
offering balanced, immersive, and above all, FUN gameplay?

  If they get it right though, SWG could be the ultimate MMORPG.  I'm taking
a wait and see approach.  I'm not going to wet myself over such an ambitious
project before I get some reliable feedback about how the game actually
plays... because there's a good chance it will suck hard in many respects.
I hope it works though, and if it does, SWG will probably be my new game.
