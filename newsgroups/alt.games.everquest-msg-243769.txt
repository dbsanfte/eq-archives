I'd take it a step further and say that malo(s) isn't worth the mana
on normal LDoN. My standard spell lineup for LDoN replaces Malos with
Tigir's. Heck, given a decent tank slow argueably isn't worth the mana
on a single pull. I'll try to slow once on incoming but if it doesn't
stick I'll switch over to DPS.
