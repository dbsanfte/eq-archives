Can anyone who's gotten one of these bags clue me in on how difficult it is?
I mean, to get to where the vendor is located without getting killed by
whatever baddies roam around Sol A? I've never been there. Plus I guess I
might be a "tad" overweight carry the 5250pp to make the purchase. Ugh. Do
people ever sell tink bags in EC?  I'm wondering how much the markup would
be..

Hmmm...

Of course, I need to sell the IBC first.. and that requires a loooong boat
trip.

Maybe I should start working on Freeport faction as well. Something I never
thought I'd want to bother with. Silly me!
