Crystal Caverns located at the Rygorr fort in Great Divide is good exp and
has some decent drops (not great, but decent)  and should be able to provide
exp for both of you, at least for the druid.  Just make sure you bring some
bat wings to levitate to the bottom of the pit and don't forget to invis
before you head in until you get to the coldain city (at least until you are
familiar with zone).  Only downside...can't bind in zone, but there are 2
exits from there.
