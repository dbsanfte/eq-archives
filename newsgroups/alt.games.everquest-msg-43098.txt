Well, i did the quest around a month ago, and 2 other druid friends have done it
since then. So at least on Veeshan the quest is not broken.
But you look for the courier the wrong place, he do NOT pop near MM zone, he pop
near GFay zone. If you dont have any helpers to intercept him, bind yourself
just outside the zone to Steamfont, and gate there as SOON as you have looted
the necro. Since you have probably already got the necros loot, beat his pet,
then him, then gate as soon as hes dead. Then track the courier, and try to
intercept him before he reaches the DE camp, he have SOW speed, and can be damn
hard to find, i didnt get him before the DE camp cause he kept warping around
(due to lag, hard to find a sow'ed mob that often dissapear for 15 sec then show
up again). If you can intercept him its easy, just beat him. He was blue to me
at 35, but hes a caster, can be rather damaging.
If he get to the DE camp, things get a little trickier. Start by thanking Tunare
that youre a druid and have Harmony, good place start. Then harmony the camp,
and pull the Courier away from the camp, and kil him.

I have another trick, but NO guarantee, worked for me when i got him, got both
me and my friend killed when we tried to get the necklace for her:
The DE Elites have a bigger aggro range than the casters. I sat down to mez
harmony and all 4 DE elites charged me, but the casters stayed behind at the
camp. If that happens, run north to the Wood elf camp, and run around the
buildings a few times, then the guards charge the DEs and beat them up. Dont
wait around, head back to the DE camp and harmony the 2 casters, and pull the
courier.
But if the casters charge along with the Elites, they remove your wolf form, and
youll become geography.

Oh, and most important, remember to use wolf form to aviod the brownies. And if
Equestrielle is up, be careful, shes a nasty corrupted unicorn, and shell kill
you on sight.


If you already have the 4 Ghast hearts youre almost done, just need a little
running, and a raiding party on Mistmoore. You can NOT get the Causis Sustance
alone, believe me, have tried. But just hang around MM and see if you cant join
a raid or a group that will go inside the castle.

And good luck on the necklace, its an invaluable item, at level 36 i have been
able to solo SGs that con yellow, and a Elder Shardwurm that conned blue.
