No, MUSHes are the ones that are big on RP. There's a whole family of
MU*s, which all have a different focus. MUSHes are for RP. MUXes are
also for RP, but use a different coding system. MUCKs are for building
game worlds and ojbects, and socializing. MUDs are basically text
versions of Everquest (EQ is based off a specific MUD, so I've heard).
MUDs don't generally go out for any but the most basic RP elements, if
any. IMHO, a text based game is much more conductive to RP than EQ,
just because the graphics in EQ just get in the way. If I pose
(/emote) '<my name> scratches her nose', of course in EQ the grapics
can't do that. But on a text game, that's not a problem because all
the grapics are in your head. It can be like reading a good book, if
you get a few great RPers in a scene.
