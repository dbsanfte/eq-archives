Buy her a copy of the game. =)

A guildie said this about his wife. "My wife isn't anti-EQ, she's
anti-me leveling faster than her."

She was a little upset becasue she previously had 2 levels up on him
(being a BST she could solo better than his ROG) until I gave him a
little PL while doing my WAR, and now he has 2 levels up on her. =)
