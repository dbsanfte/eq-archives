The better graphics don't make up for the lack of innovation, nor do 
they compensate for the "dumbing down" of the gameplay. If I wanted a 
console, I'd have one.

We have had this discussion here a few times already, so I'm probably 
beginning to sound like a broken record, but if I continue to get bored 
with a game in under ten hours (or two, in many cases), then I'll 
discontinue shelling out money for them. Now, that's just one person and 
doesn't really make a huge difference in the larger picture, but I think 
(hope?) that more people will eventually tire of putting fifty dollars 
on the table and not getting back anything that justifies this price. 
For fifty dollars, I can get at least five paperback books. As it 
stands, I get a lot more entertainment from five books than from most of 
the games released in the past eighteen months.
