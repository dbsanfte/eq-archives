Try first, re-installing all sound and video driver, and THEN re-install
DirectX.

Then In the dxdiag program, reduce the sound card excelleration to 0.

If this fails, create a file (blank) named "nosound.txt" in the EQ
directory. and see it this (disable sound) helps the video play, if so the
sound card is the problem.
