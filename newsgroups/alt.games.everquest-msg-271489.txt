Legends server has some additional zones and/or tweaked zones.  It is 
somewhat different from the other live servers.

If you (the OP) ever do get OOW, then you will already have it 
downloaded, so you won't have to install it and then patch it, just 
register it, and you will be ready to go with it.  As Hagen pointed out 
though, it is intended for higher level players than you will likely be 
for a while.
