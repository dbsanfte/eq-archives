The more of a resist you have, the more likely you are to resist spells cast
of that type, but resists aren't the entire picture, respective level also
plays a big part in it, for example a level 60 with 60 poison resist might
resist Sev's fear AoE 100% of the time, whereas a level 4 with 255 resist
would never resist it.

And ultimately the random number generator can throw wrenches into even the
best of resists.
