    If you've seen the trains, you know "risk free" is a laugh (although
overall XP gain over time is much higher than elsewhere). It's pretty hard
to convince people that mobs that triple for 543, proc a 200+ DD/stun, and
are randomly immune to movement changes (no ghetto CC) can be called "risk
free". See Invis free? The golems in PoV see through invis.

    Of course, you might know this if you could figure out a way to
three-box yourself through a trial. ;-)
