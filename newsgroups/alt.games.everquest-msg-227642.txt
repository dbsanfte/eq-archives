Can't answer for all classes, but, as a shaman, I see plenty of items I 
want in all the LDoN camps.  I think the lowest point total is maybe 800 
in one of them, 1150 in most, and 1492 in at least one if not two of 
them.  I go on any LDoN adventure, regardless of camp, knowing that I 
will need both the points and the limits at some point.
