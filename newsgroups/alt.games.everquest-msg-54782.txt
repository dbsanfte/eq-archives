They can't be! That is the point. I rarely find any enchanters in LOIO. If
you do then I have never seen one selling viscous mana. It is very dangerous
for enchanters to get the viscous mana spell at the level they get to use
it. I had to help my son's enchanter get his after he dead twice trying to
buy from the brownies. My druid went in wolf form. Not all enchanters have a
mid level druid in their pocket. If they do get it the pearls are a little
expensive at that level and the mana cost means they can not do it at the
lake but will have to have premade the viscous mana. To many strikes against
finding it there so most Iksar monks or Iksars tailors have to make the trip
off continent to get the supplies. That is where most non-Iksar monks get
WU's also.
