Had a cleric in one of my latest adventures,who told me not
to use heals over time on him,when he was going to pull at
70% health,and if I dont know that Cheal is more effective.
And this was in EF with these nice chanter like Holgreshs.

See my other post about the lack of haste classes.

I tested hard Ldons with my regular group,the
xp is really not worth it,maybe for drops,got a +6 Wis
aug when I was 54 from a hard.
Last hard I did,I got 32 points with a full 55+ group,for
a normal I get usual between 19 and 22!?
The adventure stone updates are the same,if you do
hard or normal doesnt count.
So not much arguments for a hard Ldon even with 
the best possible class combination.

Note I am talking about the 55 to 60 game,with my 65 Ranger
I would always prefere a hard Ldon,even if I know
before that there is little chance to succeed.

If I have a Shaman,Bard or Enchanter in my group every other
class works fine,even a second cleric.  =)
(That said, I remember a fun adventure with a very non-optimal
combination,it was Cle,Cle,Bst,Bst,War,with the War more linkdead
than ingame,never was there the danger that we could  loose it. )

I dont like raids much,they give me the feeling of being "dead
weight",only number of players is important,so making friends
for future raids is of no concern for me.I enjoy Ldon a lot,the fun
lies in the always changing combination of classes and players,
since I started to play the cleric I discovered it is even fun to
build a group out of lfgs.
