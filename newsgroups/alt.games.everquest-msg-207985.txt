So for uber guilders who for some reason want to be grandmaster
tailors or smiths who aren't already.  And they need only one type of
imbue, which can normally be cast by probably the highest number of
players among all the priest classes.  If they required topazes or
black sapphires or something I'd be more inclined to think something
was up.  But this... heh.

I'm not convinced it was a conspiracy.  Not to suggest you were
claiming it was, James.
