Its a complex question.

Exp to get an AA point is fixed, say at 100,000 xp points.

Killing to get 100,000 xp points at 51, and at 60, is of different difficulty.

Say you kill even con mobs, at 51 you get (lets say) 5000 xp per, thats 20
kills.

Now say you kill even con mobs at 60, getting 20,000 xp per.  Thats only 5
kills.

But killing an even con mob at 60 is harder than killing an even con mob at 51.

Kill a level 51 mob at 51, you get 5000 xp.  Kill a 51 mob at 60, you get
perhaps 2500 xp.  So it would take 20 level 51 mobs at 51, but 40 51 mobs at 60,
twice as many.  But killing level 51 mobs at 60 is much easier than killing them
at 51.

Kill 40 level 40 mobs at 51, at 2500 exp each, and you'd get that AA.  Kill 40
level 40 mobs at 60 and you'd get nothing at all because they are
greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen.

What happens at 61, the reason many people suggest stopping at 60, is that a
great many previously dark blue mobs rather suddenly become green, from 61 to
65, the greening out process is astonishingly brutal.

This matters more to soloers than to groupers, if you normally group up then you
just keep killing mobs fairly close to your level and the exp keeps rolling in.
But if you are used to soloing mobs that are just a step up from cyan, in
massive quantity with comparative ease, well that sort of mob gets much tougher
and much harder to find, post 60.
