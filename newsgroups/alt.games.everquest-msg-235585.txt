   alt.tasteless.  Not as fun a newsgroup as this one, but it does have its
moments.

   My favorite part is on the contact page.  There he has a place for the
applicant to describe where she was if she was handed by him a card inviting her
to visit his website.  I can just picture him at the local mall in front of the
Hickory Farms, smiling politely at slim women of childbearing years and asking
if they would take his card.  They probably all thought he was some kind of
religious nut until they actually visited the web site...
