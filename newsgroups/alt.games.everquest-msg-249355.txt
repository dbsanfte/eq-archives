Well.  Assuming that's what happened.  There's purportedly a few 
inconsistencies.  Personally, I haven't seen the video, and don't really 
want to.  But much has been made of how Mr. Berg screams.  Some have 
pointed out that it's bloody hard to scream like that, while having your 
windpipe sawn through.  Others have pointed out that when you saw through 
a living jugular vein, blood goes everywhere.  Not a little ketchupy 
spurt.  *Everywhere*.  Still more has been made of some funny jump in the 
video's timestamp.

Of course, sawing a previously dead man's head off isn't all that much 
less barbaric.  But one's gotta wonder what's up with that.
