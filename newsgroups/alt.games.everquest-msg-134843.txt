I would think EC tunnel would become a ghost town,
other than lowbies selling to other lowbies from the
area who can't manage a trip all the way to NK or
GFay in order to get to the moon.

I"m sure the economy is in for a shake down.  Personally,
I expect I'll be getting a lot more cash for my items
than I have previously... because I will no longer be
selling them for half fair market value in the hopes of
getting rid of them in under ten minutes, or giving up
and selling them to vendors.

Now I expect  I'll collude with my druid friend at the
end of play each night to juggle alts around so our
loot is on vendor alts and cash back in our pockets,
and leave the machine on.  Look for your best
shopping midnight to 6am, I figure, assuming most
people have only one account and thats the time
span when they are least likely to need the machine
for something else.

I'd think (no experience here) that if you go in and find
most people selling an item for 200pp, and one is selling
at 100pp, that that person would soon -not- be selling the
item anymore, and thus all the rest of the people coming
in that night will only see the 200pp vendors.  Unless
vendors set their prices based on the lowball guy, or
unless shoppers are willing to hang out in Bazarr night after
night trolling for the low price, the occaisional lowball
shouldn't affect overall pricing much.
