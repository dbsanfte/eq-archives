We did it once with like 4 groups, and it was just TOO many people.  i
firmly believe we lost more because of the extra people/lag/confusion than
because we weren't good enough or something.

Another example.. RoS.  Its trivial. we can clear it with 20 people easy -
we had 35+ people the other day for it, and had the worst wipe and C.R
possible!  After 2 hours of being dead I logged to get some sleep, and c.r'd
myself in the morning.

Id say 40% of the Prexus community can kill Draco

Why not?   Granted theres not much room, but id say its easily soloable for
a wizard.  It would be a guaranteed solo pull for a high 50's wizard.. use
some imagination to get him single and away you go.

40k on Prexus.   Maybe 10 pairs for sale on the boards and in the bazaar.

And before you think Prexus is uber cheap... CoF is still over 80k!

I'll use Vindi as my example.. I hang around kael more than I do PoF.. and
IMO they are very similar fights

KtF, Unity, Nameless Order, Stasis, Infinite Vision, Fallen Alliance,
Talionis, EA (recently dissapeared though), Twisted Fate, Southern Armada,
Sword of Fate, Enchanted Tomb, Domus?, Shining Alliance?.. maybe others I've
forgotten

Theres another handful of guilds who (via alliances) can band together and
also kill Vindi.
