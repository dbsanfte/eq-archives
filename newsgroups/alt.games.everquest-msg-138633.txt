Ok i have some answers for ya=)
ALL bricks of acrylia can be broken down into smaller bricks or even peices
of acrylia.. all the person needs is a chisel... I do it all the time.

and for the leather padding question.. well that is the same as spider
silks..each person is gonna pay what they want to pay.. i see all different
prices for it.  but i think you could have made a bit more pp for the
stuff.. but now ya know=)
