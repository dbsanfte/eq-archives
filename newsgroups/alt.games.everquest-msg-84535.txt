Words are dropped off like level mobs usually.  You might try auctioning for
them in zones around the spell level that you are trying to make.  Or you
can just get really lucky like I did and have someone send you a tell asking
you if you want to buy 6 backpacks full of word stacks and all the
researchable spells.

What server are you on?  I seem to have an abundance of words piled up in
the bank.  If you are on Tarew Marr I would be happy to give you the words
you need or just make the spell for you at no cost.
