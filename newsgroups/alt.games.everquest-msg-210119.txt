I havent played since before December 2002...

I'm looking for some advice on the most profitable place to solo... keep in
mind I am looking for PP more then XP, and I dual box a 62 druid and a 62
enc both with 45+ AA's , enc dire charm, instant evac, ch, etc etc. My old
favorite spot was soloing  Kael Arena with a DC'd giant... it was a cool
place to solo and selling the rare BP's and legs was really nice cash...
twin 100k horses thanks to Kael... anyways my point is I was able to solo
stuff that weak groups of 6 failed with...

So... I have just bought the PoP and the LoV expansions (thats how long ive
been away) and plan to return to the game this week.... My question: are
there any new pop or lov spots a 2 man -wrecking crew- can profit at?  (Enc
must be able to DC something)
