Probably noticed, just didn't want to heckle a DE necro.

There's a male barb shaman on my server named Janet, and I've seen another
guy running around with the name Melanie. (Both 65)  I don't think many
people razz them.

But then, there might be some other explanation.  Make a medium sized race
male and name him Sophie Cuddlemuffin, and see how that goes.
