My opinion is that the whole game is getting worse, not just because of the
inflated prices but because of the amount of kids playing the game, but that
is another issue. The problem of increased prices is too hyped up.

Equipment (or lack of it) at lower levels isn't such a problem now that LDoN
is out, because adventures are easy to complete and are amazing experience.
You can also buy some nice things with adventures points and you can play
adventures from 20ish to the mid 50's with good experience and loot. By the
time you are in need of a major upgrade you can either camp some places that
drop sellable items (e.g. Lower Guk) or farm HGs for money. Since a great
number of people stick with adventures, items that used to be farmed to
death are often rare in the bazaar and you could easy make money on haste
items and the like. I played my Pally main without much help from anyone
else and I now have her nicely equiped with some twinked up alts and that is
within the last year.

The trouble seems to be people don't want to wait for anything or earn it.
If you want something you have to work for it, but the bazaar has spoilt
some people and now that farming isn't so widespread it is harder to get a
good price.

I don't think plat buyers are the main reason for this change in economy,
they are just part of the problem along with a number of other aspects e.g.
a greater number of higher level characters (the game is matured now), LDoN
and the upcoming 'enhancements' GoD (I know players that used to regularly
farm items but are now working on getting some AAs in reserve and saving adv
points for some of the top end armour)
