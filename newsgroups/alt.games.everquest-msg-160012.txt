200degrees would melt the solder

1) Maybe the temperature sensor beneath the chip is faulty and giving and
incorrect reading

2) The processor fan is not moving or is incorrect rating. I would suspect
it is not blowing on the heatsink at all else the temp wouldnt be that high.

3) The core voltage for the chip is set incorrectly.

If mine was running at 70c I would be concerned and look to make remedy,
mine runs around 50c.
