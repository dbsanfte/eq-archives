You need like a good group or 2.. really 2 of melee heavy people. 
I think when my guild helped me get it we had me, 2 other druids (all
about 54 plus), 2 level 55 plus warriors, a level 58 or so warrior, a
58 or so necro, maybe a ranger or two and maybe one cleric or so...
I'm certain we had at least one.  We still got messed up and killed
all the reavers and got.. ONE JADE REAVER!!!! Really you pretty much
only have a chance of getting probably one after killing them all. It
was mostly easy for us but in one area we had like 3 at once or more. 

These were pretty uber people in good equip too. I don't even think we
had a monk to FD pull so the heavy 58 or so warrior did and died once
or twice too.. ahaha. Those guys are nasty.
