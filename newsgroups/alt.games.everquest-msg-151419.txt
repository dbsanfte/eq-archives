Hello, all. I plan on getting EQ in a few weeks and just decided to ask here
for any useful tips, links, the like. I've played EQ before and I'm not a
complete newbie. I have a 13 Iksar Warrior on Tallon on my friend's account,
but I still consider myself new to this. Sometimes when I listen to my
friends talk, I still have no idea what they're saying. :p

I have a few questions, too.

What's a "mob"?

What's "XP grinding"? (Seen that mentioned on here a few times)

Can I have free stuff? ;)

Anyways, thank you in advance for all your help and I look forward to
becoming a part of this community when I get EQ.
