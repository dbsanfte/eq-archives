Not just debuffs though, that's a general term.  Those 30 slots covered any
detrimental or beneficial effects.  Lets say a mob already has a 2 self
buffs on it.  A raid engages and it is slowed, crippled, tashed, malosed.
Necro 1 stacks 5 dots on it, as well as necros 2 and 3.  Some of the melees
have dot procs on their weapons, say 3 more slots.  The beastlords cast 2
dots.  A druid casts 1 dot.  The shamen cast 3 dots.  The next time anyone
casts a a spell on the mob that takes up a slot, lets say a necro trying to
cast Saryrn's Kiss (lifetap over time), he will get the message "Your spell
did not take hold" because all slots are occupied.

50 slots will give us alot more leeway... necros especially since we have
the most detrimental effects stacked on a raid mob on an individual basis.
