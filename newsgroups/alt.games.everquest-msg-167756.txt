I think that obvious trolling like this doesn't do much to convince me
that PvP players are any better than I've heard about them.

Nor do strawman arguments. *I* don't want to play on a PvP server
because I think about what a shithole my server would be if the
griefers and idiots we have now were allowed to PK. It only takes one
player in 100 griefing to make some aspects of blue server life really
unpleasant.

Even if PvP servers are only three or four idiots per hundred, that's
way too many.
