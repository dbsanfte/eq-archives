At the risk of sounding "old fashioned" ,with a set-up like that (i have
similar 1.6xp,GF3,512mb DDR) the problem isn't a video/cpu/internet
bandwidth problem, more-so it MAY be your harddrive!!!

I recently installed a new hardrive ,and used the upgrade as an excuse to
re-install xp, voila! no more "half second pauses" as i walk though "busier"
area (lelethin/freeport etc)

what sort of HDD have you got??? newer 40/60+ models CAN be consiberably
faster!!

This of course won't stop the "loading textures from the harddisk" issue
,(if your setup hasn't elliminated that NOTHING will!!) but i may make them
less noticable

try looking at sites like www.tomshardware.com

or http://www.anandtech.com

like this performance graph

www.anandtech.com/storage/showdoc.html?i=1287&p=13

new drives are substantially faster still!!!

you might also try upgrading your "bus master" drivers

for via m/boards try www.viatech.com

just my tuppence worth

PS try turning off texture caching (also made a difference for me!!!)

PPS sorry about the spelling/grammer (just woke up)!!!!

good luck
