I've given up trying to get this across in various newsgroups. The EULA
is for the most part not worth the electrons it's printed with. You will be 
flooded with responses saying they can do what they want, it's _their_ 
game, you agreed to it blah, blah.  There are so many who are intimidated 
by the agreement and the perceived power of the game companies--but of
course, that's the whole function of the agreement in the first place. :-)
