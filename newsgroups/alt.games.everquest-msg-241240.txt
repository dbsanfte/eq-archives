Went to scan my log for some text I got yesterday and I couldn't
find it.  Took me a few minutes to realize that the time I played
yesterday wasn't logged.  In fact, the last log date was Monday.

Looks like Tuesday's patch killed auto-logging.
I'm hoping the one today fixed it, I never remember to turn on
logging when I'm in the game.

ps. I did check my eqclient.ini file and it was in there correct:
Log=TRUE
