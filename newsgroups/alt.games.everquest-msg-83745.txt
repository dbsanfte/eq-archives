This was the early version of the Karana bread run or the Kelethin
shark meat for druids and wizards. Mages are supposed to get the coin
and hand it in for their epic, it was never intended to be an exp
farm. Hence, the experience for the handin has clearly been nerfed to
a level comparable to that of the Tumpy Tonics quest, aka.
insignificant even to a level 1 character. It is not broken.
