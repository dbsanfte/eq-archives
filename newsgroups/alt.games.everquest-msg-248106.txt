You will have to hit it much much faster than once a second if a number of 
factors are true:
1) SOW/Selos/uber-mount will obviously increase your speed, thus moving you 
out of range faster
2) Hilly terrain will necessitate more frequent access, as /corpse seems to 
have a shorter range on the Z axis(either that or it is caculating the 
distance in three dimensions a la the Pythagorean theorem- who knows)
