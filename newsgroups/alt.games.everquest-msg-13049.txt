So it all comes down to the number of characters?

Major abbreviation = good

Slight abbreviation = bad

Is that what you're claiming? Do you sit down with pen and paper,
calculating the number of dropped letters before replying to someone?

Rez=Rescusitate (saved 8) fine and dandy
Rez=Revive (saved 3) uh oh, he's a d00d

Chloro plz? = Chloroplast (saved 5) Please (saved 3) 
Would that fall under "fine and dandy" or "uh oh, he's a d00d"?

What if he's in your group and in the middle of a fight? Would that
change anything?

You'll allow me to think likewise of people who are so inconsistent as
to judge others by such strange standards?
