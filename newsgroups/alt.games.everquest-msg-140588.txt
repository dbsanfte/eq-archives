Well I didn't spot this point at all in your original reply but I did expect
this response.

True there are game limitations, in EQ, that stop it reaching the RP levels
that a pen and paper game can but it is mainly because of the people playing
that there is little room to RP. So because of this EQ should not actually
be considered anything more than Quake with Swords? Hey, we don't need a
story line, just let me level.

My problem ISN'T the introduction of ports to the Moon for the masses, it's
the lack of any story line to explain this introduction.
Until SoL there were no Horses on Norrath, afaik there was no story behind
this, it was a limitation of the engine and so accepted, when they were
released with SoL it was again acceptable not to have a story line behind it
(I am hoping that Verant didn't release some noah's arc crap about them all
being taken to the moon, that I missed) the new engine was now capable of
it. The Scions, OTH, had a story, there was a reason why they only were
stationed at full Wizard Spires, the story made sense even if sitting on
your arse for 15mins, real time, didn't.

From a gaming point of view this change is great, it is now easier to get to
the moon and Druids and Wizards get to make more money on ports. It's just
on a RP sense this could have been done so much better.
If no storyline then why not have made the Scions like the Gnome
Translocators, no more waiting, just tell them you want to get to Luclin and
your zoning to the Nexus..this improves things for everyone, not just those
of us with port capable characters.
Anyway it's done now, no story, no compromise, we have it all and for the
most part everyone is happy and I'm hardly going to be emailling Verant
asking them to reverse this change.

CF
I'm actually more offended that the Druids that appear to have researched
and made these spells are Halflings!?!
