Yeah, mostly I do.  Rangers can burst higher.  Enchanters in certain zones
can do higher (though they seem to die a lot trying).  Wizards can burst
higher for very short time periods.  Nobody else can even touch the DPS of a
magician (though some fights are magician unfriendly as well, everybody has
downsides, those are fairly rare).
