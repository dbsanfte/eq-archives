Oh my yes. You don't know how many times I've looked at my gem list and
grimly unmemed my DDs and DoTs in favor of more mez/root/stun options -
knowing for a fact that this makes me almost totally dependant on my group
to save my bacon if I can't get an angry chanter-basher under control...
Just one more gem slot would make me so very happy.

Of course, it's not going to happen and I understand why, but I can
dream can't I?
