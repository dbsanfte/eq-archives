I don't like being inspected without permission because it's just sort of
invasive, like having someone stare in my windows or something.  But most
"inspections" are accidental.  I do it all the time, because I pan using my
mouse and I accidentally left click other players. I just found out that I
can turn off the ability to inspect with /inspect [on/off] and I think I
will do this before I offend someone.
