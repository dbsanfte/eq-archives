Juries are not irrationally biased. You seem to have this view that no
one here has so far agreed with, namely that a Fun Wargame is
inherently impossible, and that a Wargame with no rules but "win" is
unable to be fun. Nowhere else in this thread has anyone supported
that view. If the jury in Question was made up of people who believed
that Murders were only possible for religious reasons would they be
able to reach a rational judgement in a murder case? If their
definition of a term was substantially different then society as a
wholes definition would that Jury be able to render a rational
judgement in terms of the society?
