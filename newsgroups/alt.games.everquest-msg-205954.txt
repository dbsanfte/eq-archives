Well...

Yesterday, I decided to log on my alt Marrtuk.  I played with him for a
while, soloing in the Dreadland combine spires.  After a while, I logged off
and logged on Monual my main.  I've got it in my head to maximize his
faction with all of Cabilis so I can finally explore that city - the one
city I have yet to take a look around.  So he went to Kurn's tower and
killed a bunch of skeletons (only in places were there were no XP groups, of
course).  I turned in some bone chips, make a very small dent in my faction
changes.  (I'll need to turn in a total of 8,000 bone chips to maximize
faction).  Of course, this doesn't do a thing for Necro faction, so I went
to Warsilik woods and killed Iksar bandits and manslayers.  My task here is
slightly less onerous; I only need to kill 2,000 of them to maximize that
faction.  I cleared the bandit caves for a while, developing a pattern that
should help when I go back.  Still a long ways to go.

Then I decided to group.  When I went to Plane of Tranquility, I was looking
for a group only in the Elemental planes, because in a full group I get 3-4%
AAXP per kill.  That's about an AA point per hour or so.  Any other plane
doesn't come close.

So, I must be a powergamer where XP>fun, neh?  =)

The point being don't necessarily judge by where people chose to XP.  It
doesn't mean that's the only place they chose to play the game or the only
activity they choose to pursue in EQ.  It could just be that, when they do
decide to XP, they want to go to the zone(s) where they can be the most
effective and get the most XP.
