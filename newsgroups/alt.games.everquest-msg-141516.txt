Not quite...
You can teach up to one point higher than your current skill

If you have a 96, you can teach someone to 97.
Then what you do is the two of you zone (to 'lock' the skillup). then the
other person can get you two skill ups. from 96 to 98 (one higher than him.)
Zone. Repeat.

I learned 7 languages from 1 to 100 that way.

I speak all the learnable languages at 100 now...  Yes we were bored. I
think we were waiting for people to get to a low level (like 30s ) raid we
had set up, and they were an hour or more late.

It hasn't been worthless... someone paid me 300pp to master him in all the
non pc languages 3 weeks ago. Took me an hour...
