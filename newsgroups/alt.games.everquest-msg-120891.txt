I have a 50 Ogre Warrior and a 52 Shaman on separate accounts and been
playing with the AGI DEX STR and STA stuff. STA equipment and stuff has it
at 112 with buff at 152 received around 80 hit points but nothing else
noticeable. Dex with the 50 extra I noticed a little more hits and 1-2 extra
procs per fight off of weapons ( Blood Fire and a Blood Point). 45 extra AGI
was 5ac increase and taking about 1/4 a bubble less damage per fight. Str
was the most dramatic change with 67 additional, overall damage output was
very noticeable. I seemed to be able to stun more with slam, and mobs died
faster. With all Buffs I would need 2 less superior heals per fight around
1000 hit points. During the test the 2 characters were doing the Crystalline
Wrums in GD.
