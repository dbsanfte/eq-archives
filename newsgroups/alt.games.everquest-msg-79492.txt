180-something)

your chance for a skill up in smithing is partially based on the highest of
strength wisdom or intelligence. If you have a 255 intelligence no amount of
str will help you . If on the other hand you are a tank with a 50 int a 200
str is just dandy.

tailoring is similiar but uses dx instead of str.

the preceding is not accepted as fact by the tradeskill community but anyone
who disagrees is wrong :p
