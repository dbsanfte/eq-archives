The original whine was that Mages don't get to summon, for example, a level
22 pet AT level 22 (they get a pet that's already blue at 20, when they
aquire the spell). The justification for this class-envy was that
Beastlords, to continue the above example, are guaranteed to GET a level 22
pet AT level 22.

The first poster forgets that he will get his MAGE pet upgraded at 24... and
again at 29... while the Beastlord is still struggling with that lvl 22 pet
when he gets to 29 (the Hybrid Lag I mentioned in my earlier post in this
thread)... coupled with the fact that a beastlords backup-damage output is
mainly through melee ability (he's basically a badly nerfed Monk, hybrid
heals instead of mend, no Feign, and Priest Class Offence)... whereas a Mage
is generally regarded as having the second most powerful nukes in the game
added to the ability to gate away from trouble.
