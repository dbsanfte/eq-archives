    Bear Fang Glove, or something like that, isn't it? Wait - I have a gear
question - TO ALLAKHAZAM'S!

    Yup, Bear Fanged Glove: Dmg 7, Dly 19. Wt 0.70. +3 Str, +15 HP. Less
damage than a Fighting Baton or a Wu stick, some marginal stats, but nice
weight.

    Compared with other commonly available 1HBs for monks it's poo. Fighting
Batons are cheap, and at lower levels it'll be outdamaged by a Knuckle
Duster which is also 1 K or less. Compared to the other H2H weapons
available it's pretty good - there aren't many out there, and the most
common one seen (Polished Steel Ulak) has a 9/27 ratio.

    Lots of monk twinks long on cash, short on brains. You sold for a
quarter or less of the usual price I see on this (1 K+). The stats aren't
worth the weaker damage output. Practice H2H up with your fist!
