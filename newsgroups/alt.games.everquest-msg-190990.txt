loosely speaking, a "camp" is a room, series of rooms, or an outdoor
area containing a set of monsters.  there are no hard and fast rules
defining exactly where one camp ends and another begins, but generally
it's as many monsters as one group of PCs can keep clear.

each zone will have its own set of camps, and you just have to learn
what they are.

the term probably originated with the lower-level camps in East and
West Commonlands, North Ro, Faydark, etc. which actually do look
like camps -- there's a campfire and a ring of tents.

> KEI?  What is it?

Koadic's Endless Intellect.  it's a spell that high-level enchanters
can cast on you which greatly increases your rate of mana regeneration.

> How can you tell what your faction levels are?

target a monster and use the "consider" command (press C, or type
/consider).  this will tell you roughly what faction you have with
that monster.

if you want to know EXACTLY what your faction level is, i dunno.
