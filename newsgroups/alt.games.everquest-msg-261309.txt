I do tech support for my employer. Only my coworkers call me. 

Some of them don't understand the on/off switch does something. I've
had to explain electricity to them.

Some don't know what timezone zone they are in.
 
One guy, he makes over 90,000 dollars per year, cannot remember from
one day to the next how to use his email... and he uses the exact
same computer and setup for the past 7 years.

The topper is the guy who continually mispellls his own name, and
his last name has only 4 letters in it. He is a department director.
