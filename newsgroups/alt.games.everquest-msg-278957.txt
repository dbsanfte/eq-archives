Totally agree.  I am a person that likes to group and hang out with friends 
and guildies, but there are times when I log in with things already "in 
progress" or at odd off hours where there just isn't a whole lot going on. 
Zones like these are an option in such cases.  I, like others, really don't 
want to see this done to an extreme, if I wanted a mission-oriented mmorpg 
I'd play MxO or CoH.
