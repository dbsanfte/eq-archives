Okay, umm...which verses are these?

I'm going to throw a wild guess and assume one is that "Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live" line. ><

I seem to recall reading somewhere that the line was slightly
mis-translated, anyway. At the very least, "witch" didn't mean what
"witch" means to us. The word more closely translates to "deceiver",
as I recall... *shrug* Could be the source I read was wrong, could be
I remember wrong. If I could remember where I read it I'd check it
out.
