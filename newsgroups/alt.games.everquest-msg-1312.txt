I think that is how it works, but the amount of time they give you to
get back on is the same amount of time it takes your avatar to
disappear.  If you can get back in before then, your summoned stuff
(including pet) will remain.  I've only managed that 2 or 3 times in 35
levels.  More recently I've been getting the message "you have an
active character on this server, please wait for syncronization, yadda
yadda yadda"  Of course, by the time it's re-synced, the window has
passed.

See the logic?
