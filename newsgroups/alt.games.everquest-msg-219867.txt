LA Times? Leftist Rag. NY Times... Same. Washington Post? You got it! 

NBC, ABC< & CBS? Leftist.

CNN? Clinton News Network

MSNBC? Don't even get me started...

Dallas Morning News? Left Left Left

Atlanta Journal? Left

For the most part, TV & Newspapers are EXTREMELY left leaning. Radio
leans right.
