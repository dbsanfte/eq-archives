 Depends on the situation. There are times in combat where I will turn
off attack and feign for a few seconds to try and get aggro off of me.
Normally I wont bother on some of the more uber encounters since they
don't normally fall for it and just keep whacking me anyway. Normally if
I continue getting aggro though I will try other ways to avoid it such
as switching to 2hb or waiting a few seconds to engage the mob.
