DAoC was one of the smoothest startup for an Online RPG I've seen.  AO was
by far the worst.  I just don't see why everyone has to have this, my game
is the best attitude.  Do you eat the same thing everyday without change?
How boring.  I'll still be playing EQ and DAoC so when I get bored with one
I can go back to the other.  Life is full of different and wonderful things.
Every one should try something different at least once in a while.
