"You can lead a camel to water but you can't force it to drink".

Plainly marked as OT so I'm happy. It may have turned into a media circus
since it occurred but on Sat night/Sunday morning news was very slow getting
out. This could affect someone who posts in the AGE community. Heck - trips
to Bali are so common they aren't even considered overseas to most
Australians. Europeans as well like the place.

I would be very surprised if it didn't affect at least one person somehow
(change holiday?) besides myself. I plan on going on a holiday there in a
few months to Ubud (Kuta stinks anyhow) since this will depress prices
greatly.
