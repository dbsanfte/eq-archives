Greater remove curse.  Most Ssra bosses have very nasty ae curses, and the
traps are lethal too.
We gave GRC to druids, shamans and paladins over clerics to give them more
of a role in these zones

FoH wont be effected, its everybody below them that will be severely
effected by this impact

No, I tank like ANY class in the higher end zones that is over the ac cap.
I dont tank like a warrior. never have and never will.

Please prove that monks tank better than warriors, because I think it was a
lie started by a moron and passed around as vocal by stupid people who
didn't question it

My guild has rangers and rogues who can tank mobs that I do, and the only
way you'd notice a difference is by logging and parsing.  Im not saying
there isnt a difference, because with different skills/caps it clearly
implies there are (or should be), but at this level of the game the
difference is not something you can spot by observing the fight
