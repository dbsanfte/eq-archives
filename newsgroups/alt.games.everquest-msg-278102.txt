Hah! I will indeed keep it blazing. Veritas was the motto of a school I 
attended and came to mind when we were thinking about our guild's back story 
in connection with the search for what really happened in the Shattering (a 
cataclysmic event in the EQII lore, resulting in the destruction of many of 
the old world regions), so the name really resonated.

No wonder I couldn't get veritas.com!  Let me know if they ever decide to 
abandon it!  ;-)
