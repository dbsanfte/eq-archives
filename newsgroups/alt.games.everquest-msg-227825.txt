My druid was healer at L49 for the camp that drops the ac38 plate
legs.  Without a mana regen buff, I might add (was on Stromm well
before KEI sellers had appeared).  IIRC, the group was 54 WAR, 55
SHD, 52 PAL, 52 NEC, 49 DRU.  It was "old fashioned" EQ, with med
breaks, as you might expect.  Same group with 51 CLR added to it
about doubled the kill rate, counting the CR when we overpulled
and wiped.
