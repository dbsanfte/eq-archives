Looking over my library of games, I've been stuck for 50 bucks numerous 
times.

Hell... I beat Jedi Knight II in three weeks and haven't played it 
since. It cost 69.00 and lasted less than the free 30 day trial for 
eq1... and I've got no regrets about that either.

As to suggesting I grind the cow... what are you saying? that I have to 
spend 1000s of hours before I'll get to the 'good' part?? I fail to see 
your point; a 'good' mmrpg should be 'fun' even at level 3. Just because 
eq isn't terribly, is just another reason to want more from an mmrpg...
