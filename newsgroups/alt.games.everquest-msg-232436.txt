I had some similar problems with the game crashing on startup.. would let me
log in, choose the server.. POP!.. nothing.. black screen.. no mouse.. CTRL
ALT DEL Nothing, alt tab.. all the usual tricks.. no good

Would finally swear, curse and give the one fingered salute to the reset
button..
Deleted the eqgame.exe and all other *.exe files not needed to start the
patcher.. complete file check..  <touch wood> no problems so far since..
