Sounds about right to me.

Yep, best place I have found, pretty quick even without tracking.

EK or Stonebrunt.  Jaggedpine at later levels.

The pelts and silks might actually sell for a bit more individually, 
don't ask me why.

Sounds right.

Never did them, but I hear it's about the best you can do for guaranteed 
cash, particularly at your level where farming high price items is not 
really an option for the most part.

There are spiders, spiderlings and wolves in the zone, as well as 
skeletons.

They do seem to sell for ludicrous prices in the bazaar.  Keep all the 
HQ, MQ, and LQ hopper hides, then get a bunch of shadeling silks, and 
make leather padding out of them as well.

Swirling shadows from Twilight sea is a possibility.

Don't know enough about the differences to comment.
