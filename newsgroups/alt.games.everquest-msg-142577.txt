You could have looked at casters realm ...

Still here are the details :

It is unknown exactly what this hammer will do but it is highly probable
that it may have a focus effect of some kind on it given it's high
level.
This spell is currently only on the Test Server

Seems to be a no drop hammer with a "very high proc rate" of a 75 - 150
DD
I can't seem to find the current stats of the hammer.

Oddly found it now on the sony bords :-?

Hammer Stats
LORE, MAGIC, NO DROP, NO RENT
AC 10
14 DMG, 18 DLY, Bane Undead +10
25 Dex, 8 Wis, 35 HP, 35 Mana
+ 10 Sv. Disease, + 5 Sv. Magic, +10 Sv. Poison
Effect: Hand of the Gods.
--
Hand of the Gods is a DD that can hit anything, have not seen it
resisted yet, but you can get partials. High I've seen was 141.
Stats/info From Allden of Test

People are talking about Yalp V + hammer giving upto 8 procs a min
(average) 
This would be some "OK" DPS.

Thoughts ?

GO GO BATTLE CLERIC !
