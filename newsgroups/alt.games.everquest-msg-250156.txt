... So this expansion will require LDoN for part of it? That's a new
one. They always like.. never had a new expansion require a previous
expansion, just the original version. As per elemental-calibre ldon
armor... oh.. i can feel the people building points now :>

Well.. about time.

Hmm.. if PoP was outsourced and everything past wasn't.. yeah.. they
really need to outsource. PoP was stellar when it came to new models
and just plain cool looking models.

Interesting.

People will believe this when they see it.

Not necessarily. But for a lot of them.. it would help. I really
wouldn't want all of the gods made instanced, but certainly targets
like elemental gods would be reasonable. At the same time, old world
they really need to get both Emperor Ssrahezha and Vex Thal instanced.
That one change would change everything concerning progression.

One of the things they can also do is set Vex Thal to be accessible
when the three elemental planes(Earth, Air, Water) go active. All that
would need to happen really is that the Grand Librarian hands you a
Scepter of Shadows and the instancing works off that key. That then
allows guilds to be keyed for Vex Thal using normal elemental
progression in lieu of shard farming/emp/orb.

People will quibble with me here i'm sure.. but considering PoP is
probably the best expansion that has ever been produced... yeah. Like
it or not, we would quite simply not be where we are at today without
it.. its way too entrenched in pretty much everything we do from the
raid window, to PoK to the main route for progression at the moment.
Heck.. most current raid strategy developed off the events in Planes
of Power.
