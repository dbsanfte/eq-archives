(just laughing) OE is what most people use, but it's not the 'best'
newsreader, and it defaults to top posting......however, there are
newsgroups who prefer posters to top post, but most will consider you some

I have on various occasions used other better newsreaders, but OE is free
and it's always there after reinstalling windows due to hardware/software
wipes, so I got used to it.
