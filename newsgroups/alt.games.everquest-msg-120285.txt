Yeah, and don't forget that druids and shamans get pets later on in life and
we haven't even had the past 40 or so levels to learn how to use them
properly unless we have already played a pet class (I haven't played a pet
class past 6 yet).

But seriously, I had first thought of this as a mage/necro upgrade until
someone mentioned beastlords earlier. Not every addition to the game is
there to benefit just the end game, which isn't all there is to the game.
Besides, everyone develops a different playing style: some necros give up
pets at some point and others don't; maybe this pet upgrade will encourage
more people to keep there pets.
