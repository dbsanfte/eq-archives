It's also entirely possible that local retailers may have sold out
their stock some time ago and not bothered to restock. Most stores
seem to stock only the "latest and greatest," although how late
depends on how much shelf space they have.

Although, Amazon.com calling it "OUT OF STOCK" usually means out of
circulation.

Of course, you can buy Trilogy for what I paid for Scars of Velious.
Lucky bastiche.
