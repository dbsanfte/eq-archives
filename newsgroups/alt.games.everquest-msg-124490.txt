Would you like to hear my other wish list, then?

For all Paladins - killing non-evil members of good races (Dwarven guards &
merchants, for example) would remove all of the Paladin's magic abilities,
Lay on Hands, and class-specific disciplines and AA skills permanently.

For all Paladins - owning one of the Ghoulbanes taken from the Shin Paladin
(*not* the Quest Ghoulbanes) would cancel all abilities until it was given
away / destroyed.

For all Rogues - no backstab abilities, no critical hits, no Assassin
discipline.

For all Shamans - healing / buffing anyone not of their own race costs 3X as
much mana.

For all Druids - instant permanent loss of all magical abilities if they
help kill creatures on their God's / Goddess' home plane.

For all Necros - Never be able to get higher than Apprehensive with *any*
group, even their own guild.


You're right.  They are whiny inane self-serving self-improving wishes.  Odd
thing, though.  They're all for classes I play, they're all things I want,
and every single one of the above other folks would consider a nerf.
