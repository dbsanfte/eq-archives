I don't know about everyone else, but the one I went to never taught me that
"ganna" is a word.  They also taught me how to capitalize and punctuate
correctly.  So, what school did you go to?

> must of taught you some pre-school shit at 12th grade, so what happens

And it seems you never learned that pre-school shit.  Or was  that as far as
you made it?

> if someone doesnt have a credit card? they cant play? thats pure

Then they should be more careful about their credit rating.  So, why can't
you get a credit card?  Even the mass mailers won't accept you?

> bullshit and im not ganna put up with false advertisement. why in the

No, false advertisment would be saying that no credit card was required to
play.  Common sense, and a little though would tell you that you may need a
credit card to play... well, common sense, a little though, and reading the
box.

It's been here way too long for that.  Also, if you read the agreement that
you would have signed, if you ever qualified for a credit card, things like
credit card theft are protected against.  Then the credit card company hires
Kaiser Sose to hunt down the last remains of Verant at their homes, and
kills them and their children.  Oops, sorry, got carried away.

Did it promise you that chance, or did you make an assumpton?  It seems
you're making an ass out of you and Umption (hated that movie, but it's got
so many good quotes).

> anyways, i bet one couldnt gain shit for skills in 1 day. ill forget

Oh, so you have a problem for actually having to earn your skills and
equipment?  I guess you'd be one of those newbies sitting around in Freeport
spamming the shout channel, begging for uber gear.  "Does anyone have any
Dragon Loot to give me?  I'll settle for Plains Gear!"  In that case, good
riddance.

There's a big difference between being stolen from, and being too stupid to
read the box.  Which side of this are you on?

> easyly.. all shall know that EQ is a bad choice from now on... im

Let's see, for ten dollars a month, Verant gives me a way to enjoy my off
time when it's raining (which it always seems to be doing), or when I'm
working backshifts and my off time is in the middle of the night.  Let's not
forget that it also gives me a way to talk to friends on the other side of
the country that I haven't seen in a long time.  Yeah, I'm being robbed,
that's the ticket.

> care..you all probably are fat lazy bastards with no wifes... that
> like to eat doritos in your parents basement with a lack of education
> and cant get laid and with no friends at all... heh enough said

1)  No, Uncle Sam makes sure I don't have time to be lazy or fat.
2)  My fiancee gave you the finger (and she's usualy very lady like)
3)  Uncle Sam also keeps me quite a ways away from my parents.
4)  We've seen what your education has done for you.  Maybe you should move
back in with your parents and try elementary school again.
5)  My fiancee gave you the finger again.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
