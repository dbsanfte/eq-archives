Expect another patch real soon now, but meanwhile here is a copper flood
for newbie bards that don't mind the cold.

The Ice Golbin Igloo around 1,713 -236 (EQAtlas maps) in Everfrost has
post it note goblin scout and goblin whelps.

Go up to the scout and whelp on the snow drift behind the igloo and
whack on DDD (Denon's Disruptive Discord) and stand there for a while.
The scout and the whelp naturally start attacking you, then run off as
their health drops away and they die.

After a while, stand on top of the igloo and try not to fall off
laughing. There is almost a continuous train track of ice goblin backs
stretching off into the distance. The hard park is as you start corpse
looting, you kick off the same effect from the whelp inside the igloo
and the scout beside.

Eventually you end up in the traffic stream and I almost gained a stack
of polar bear cub skins whilst trying to clean the corpses up.

All low grade loot Over 1pp in less than a hour), but good for a laugh.
