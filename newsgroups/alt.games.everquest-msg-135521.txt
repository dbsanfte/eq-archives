On Usenet, you don't have to respond to a question with "I don't know."  A
lack of response serves the exact same purpose with a lot less
resources/time spent by everyone.

What got DT jumped on was him obviously *not* knowing, and acting like the
mere act of not knowing was knowledge of some sort.  I've been working on UI
modifications for a couple weeks or so, and I know lots of other people that
have too.  To think that *skinners* wouldn't have entire sets out or
in-progress on the day it went live is just ludicrous, or ignorant of the
entire skinning "scene" and how fast people work on such stuff when they're
hyped about it.
