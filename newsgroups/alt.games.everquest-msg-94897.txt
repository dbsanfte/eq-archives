    Hello, did you say WANDERING? As in, not always close to a dozen
lizardmen wandering? As in "can be pulled singly" wandering?

    I think my level 30 troll shaman just got a new place to hunt. Close to
home, friendly guards, vendors that'll even likely have bat wings on them,
and the newbie zone XP bonus - woot! I might even get that shovel Sprickett
the mage has been looking for. :-)
