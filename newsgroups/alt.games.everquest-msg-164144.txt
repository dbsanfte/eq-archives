On my server, Tunare, the lowest I've ever seen a Windblade in the
bazaar was 35k, had it ever showed up for 10k I would own one.  The
cheapest I've heard paid for it by a non-uber, again on Tunare, is
20k.  But that only tempers your point.  I haven't seen even one of
those Monk weapons for sale in the bazaar, there're always 2 or 3
Windblades available if you care to pay the toll (45k now, and still
worth it if you have the cash and not the connection to get a better
price).

I'd have to know the actual damage bonus numbers to accept that.  The
raw damage/delay ratio favors the 30/22 by a factor of 1.2.  The ratio
between the delays (2:1) means that the damage bonus on the Windblade
would have to be twice as large for just the bonus damage to be equal
over time, it'd have to be significantly larger still to overcome the
1.2:1 advantage in basic damage.

I'll agree that Windblade is way too common tho, the only comparable
weapons I've actually seen in players hands are rare NToV drops.  And
those were Paladin and/or SK weapons, not Ranger usable like Windblade.
