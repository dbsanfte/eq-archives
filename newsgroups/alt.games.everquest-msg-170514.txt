Another factor is that it appears that with PoP, they have done quite a bit
of rewritting of the EQ client and server software.  My guess is that they
took that opportunity to increase security, by moving more things to the
server, so that it will be harder to find things to hack.

It's interesting to note that Mythic announced a week or so ago that they
were going to enable alt-tab and windowed mode in DAoC as an experiment.
Cheating in DAoC would have a *much* bigger impact on the game than cheating
in EQ.  In EQ, ShowEQ isn't *that* big an advantage.  In DAoC, seeing people
who are trying to hide behind trees and rocks and buildings would be a
significant advantage in RvR.  So, if Mythic thinks that they can allow
multitasking without it killing DAoC, I think Sony can pull it off for
EQ.
