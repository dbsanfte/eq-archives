I have to agree here.  I've seen some real winners: 

Youwannadome
Agreattop
Jimmyeatworld


The worst I ever saw, however, was one I actually petitioned: 

Aryran Eruditekiller (might have been Eruditeslayer, can't remember). 

When the GM answered my petition, at first he said that maybe that
person is a roleplayer and is allowed to hate Erudites.  *shakes head
sadly*  I had to explain the Third Reich and Aryan philosophy to him. 
He verified it with a GM and said they'd investigate it.  I've never
seen that name again. :)
