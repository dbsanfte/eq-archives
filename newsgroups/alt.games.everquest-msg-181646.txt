Hi Bizbee,

I am sorry if you didn't like the way I communincated and think I've an
ego -- I always tried to be up front with the playerbase and as
communicative as possible, especially earlier on, when there were less
players, and it was easier to interface.

I think, however, that you're confusing me and Raph Koster (aka Designer
Dragon, aka Holocron), who worked for OSI on UO, and is currently the
Creative Director on SW:G.

I've never worked at OSI, but was the co-designer and original Producer on
EQ, and later VP at Verant.

As for my current project, I co-founded Sigil Games back in Jan 2002 with
Jeff Butler.  We signed a development deal with Microsoft, who is funding us
to develop a new MMOG.  It's currently unannounced, so I can't say much,
other than it does take time to develop these games (we technically started
development in April), and that it is indeed the 'next big thing' :) (oops,
there's that ego :)
