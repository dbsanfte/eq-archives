I am quite excited about the new race, itll be neat to see frogloks
running around killing stuff.  The only thing I am a little disappointed
in the class choices.  With that high dex and agi, I would be expecting
either Monk or Beastlord.  Moreso a beastlord as in Gukta there is an
animal trainer in there, even asks you when you hail him, if you too are
an animal trainer.  Point is it seems that training animals/insects are
already an integral part of Froglok life, and it seems only natural that
that be an available class.
