Nope. That setting (at least the one you are painting) is pretty much
comprised of drinking, belching, butt-scratching, smoking (various
substances), cursing, necking/fornicating-in-the-filthy-bathroom
patrons. This group is obviously a much more diverse bunch.

There is a big difference. We need to keep in mind the type of person
Connie was addressing. It wasn't the casual occasional user of
profanity who implements it for the purpose of emphasis or to relay a
degree of passion for a particular topic. It was the one who merely
uses it to be using it or overuses it. She asked that it be toned
down, not eliminated.
