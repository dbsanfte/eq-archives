I believe the best way to implement this would be for each mob to have
something similar to the 'buff boxes' that players have.. when a person
clicks on a mob (or a PC, for that matter), they should be able to see which
buffs THEY have cast on that creature.  Im not saying I should be able to
click a spider and see that it has a damage shield on.. but if I cast DoD on
that spider, it would be nice to be able to see if it's still on it.  It
would be very nice for shamans, clerics.. most classes that can cast,
actually.  Wouldn't it be nice to check your group to see who needs buffs
just by clicking on them?  Is their haste off yet?  click.  rehaste.
Anyways.. would be nice.

I thought of this a while ago, (and I think most players have at one point
or another), but I think there was some semi-decent reason they haven't
implemented it.. can't remember it though.
