The game world is divided into "zones". At the edge of each
zone is an invisible zoneline. When you step into the
zoneline, the game will pause for a bit (20 seconds to a
minute or two depending on your hard drive, cpu, and
connection speeds), then the game will return control to
you. It may look like you're in the exact same place you
were, but you're actually in the next zone, and may continue
moving forward again.

Here is a good set of maps for seeing where the borders of
zones are, should you wish to travel:

For faster travel, there is a running enhancement spell that
Shamen get a level 9 called "Spirit of the Wolf" (usually
abbreviated SoW) that you can cast on your self or others
(and others with it can cast on you). Higher level Wizards
and Druids can travel even farther (including their guests),
using porting spells.

Every town has a "banker." You may have noticed in Halas
that when you right-click your mouse when you are near some
of the town people that a "merchant window" appears on the
left side of your screen. The banker will turn into a
banking window on the left, showing your stored items and
stored currency. While you are interacting with a banker,
any copper that you drop in a silver box will automatically
be converted to silver, and so on.

Your banker is identified as number 7 on this map of Halas:

(If you haven't found Halas [your home town] here is map
that shows how to get to it from Everfrost [look for the
number 1 in the upper-left corner]:
