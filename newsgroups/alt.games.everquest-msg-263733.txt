Please pull your head out of the sand and perform a reality check.

If you felt the sightest twinge of offense at that, realize that I never 
told you to do anything; I merely asked. I even said "please". If you 
are offended its your own failing.

There. Now that we've established that phrasing something as a request, 
and even using the word please has only marginal bearing on whether or 
not I just told you to do something we can get on with having a 
conversation.

Julie's intent was not to have Annie, at Annie's sufferance oblige her 
some small favour. Julie expected deference. Phrased  as a command or a 
request the semantics were the same.

Nope. That would at most explain 'others' response to Julie/Annie. Not 
Annie's own responses.

Couldn't resist a little arrogance all your own could ya?

Its probably a little premature of you to stereotype me based on the ng 
you encountered me in. Guess what; this isn't the only group I'm in.  
You might want to review the very first thing I said in this post. 

When I wrote that I was simply making a point; how apropos.

:p
