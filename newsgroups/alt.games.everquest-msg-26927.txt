On the contrary, I my guild VnV has alliances with 2 other good guilds, UNM
and Tephysian Guard.  And Goods and neuts have actually been getting along a
lot better recently.  We were' fighting in Black burrow last night with only
one PK incident.  And not many purposeful trains either.  It really isn't as
bad as you think.  And goods would come down to stop the pking just like
neuts would help stop one newt from PKing everyone in EF if they were doing
the same thing.  Mainly for player faction.  If you have one asshole giving
goods a bad name, the goods are going to want to stop him.  I know if I
heard about a newt doing something like this, I'd want to stop him from
ruining the name of my alliance.
