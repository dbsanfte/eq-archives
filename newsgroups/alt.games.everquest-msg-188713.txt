Pfft.  The 'adult mods' for the non-multiplayer-sims game are dull to 
begin with.  I mean, where's the "bend her over the washing machine and 
let the vibration do all the work" option?  Hot Date *nearly* had 
something going, but then, that has never, ever worked with WinXP for me 
(or a friend) anyway, so I only got to use it for awhile :(  As to the 
online game - never played it, but from what I saw in previews, looks 
pretty well just as pg-13 as the original.
