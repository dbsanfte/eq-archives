I don't have any solutions for you, sorry, but I always
wonder just what sort of pathetic psychos these folks are
in their real lives...

Probably the best approach is to try to ignore him as much
as possible.  Giving him more "reasons" for him to think
you've "wronged" him will just make him redouble his efforts,
but if you keep a low profile eventually he'll find some
other player who offends him more, and go stalk them
instead.

But as others have mentioned, it might be a good idea to
/petition his more provable offenses a few times, to add
to what surely must be a long GM file of "what the hell
is wrong with this guy?" petitions.  Eventually the size
of the list will reach critical mass and the GMs will
can him.

We had a griefer on Quellious who was *very* careful about
how she went about it, never saying anything incriminating,
and being an angel when GM/Guides were in the zone (I exchanged
tells with one of the GMs, and he said that from all
appearances, she was using a ShowEQ-style program which
let her know even when an "invisible" GM was in the zone
watching).

It got so bad that whenever she showed up in a dungeon
zone, half a dozen people would /ooc an alert, warning
everyone to be on the lookout.

Nonetheless, after many months of this, she vanished for
good.  And good riddance.  Apparently either the long
list of complaints outweighed the "we have to see her
in action" rule, or the GMs got pissed off enough to find
a way to trip her up.

In the long run, griefers can only get away with their
antics if no one bothers to /petition them.
