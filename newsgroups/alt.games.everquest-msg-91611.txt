Which is (nice word jazz, thanks ;) ) "boohuckey". 

As I think was said in this thread and has been said in many places
elsewhere on servers where only one guild can currently kill the sleeper
they farm ST until such time as another force is becoming strong enough
to farm it for primals.

And then they release the sleeper such that the primal drop rate is
so slashed they maintain a competitive advantage for a long long time.

They kill the warders *precisely* so the other guilds cant.

Just because something "is", doesnt absolve one of all responsibility
for the choices they make regarding it.
