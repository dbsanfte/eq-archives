Give that pet a rusty two hander and he'll outdamage a level 9 necro's
(weaponless) pet by a healthy margin.  He cannot tank for you for
more than a few seconds unless you get him some hefty HP buffs...
but his damage output should rival yours if you are untwinked... and
rusty two handers at level 9 are -not- a twink.  With the new pet
changes, having him possibly outdamage you doesn't matter, so you
will see your overall damage output double using him as your little
helper.

Remember, the key commands are
/pet attack
/pet back off
/pet guard here
and most importantly for a SK
/PET NO TAUNT
