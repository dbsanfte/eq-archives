I'm using one of these beauties to build my level-51 human Pally's piercing skill
(currently 29 and climbing) ;->  As you can imagine, ratio is out the window when your
skill is this low.

I call PLoT a beauty because it has a FANTASTIC graphic.  One of the neatest I've seen.  I
like to keep it equipped in PoK, where I get a few /tells each evening asking me for a
link.

Rambling...

Once I hit level-55, I plan to swap PLoT for the Narandi's Lance that's sitting in my
bank, unless I come across a Heavy Windrider's Lance between now and then.

My raw DMG weapon is War Marshall's Bladed Staff.  It outparses anything else that I've
had my hands on, including Windblade.

I swap WMBS with LBoV+TES to keep my 1HS skill up, with Anklesmasher+TES for my 1HB, and
Devestating Maul for my 2HB.  And most recently, PLoT to build Piercing.
