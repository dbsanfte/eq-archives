YOu got hosed. Bring it back to the local gamecrazy, get a refund.
They sold you a used mmorpg, which should not be sold at all.

See, MMORPGS have account keys which are shrinkwrapped safely in the
package. Once the person buys the game retail, they use that key and
it is forever connected to their login/password. That means that you
should never buy such a game used. 

The game crazy store should have known this, so demand your money
back. They should not be taking back used copies of an mmorpg
"password code" game in the first place.
