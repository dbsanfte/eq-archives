Creative Thinking, as used here, is the ability to solve a new and unique
problem with only the knowledge and experience of past problems.  The new
problem may be similar in some ways to previous problems, in which case,
experience is applied.  Where the problem is unique, a way must be found to
apply available resources to the problem.  The term creative thinking is a
little misleading, as it merely means finding a unique (to one's own
experience and knowledge) solution to a problem.  Any problem can be broken
down into smaller parts and the parts solved in order to come closer to
solving the whole. But, if one refuses to develop outside of experience,
then the unique solutions will not come.

So what it boils down to is applying available resources to a problem not
previously encountered, either partially or fully.  That is a skill that can
be trained.  In fact, it is a large part of the basic training for military
officers.

Cheers,
Eric
