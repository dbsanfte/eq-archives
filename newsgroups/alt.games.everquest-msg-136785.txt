    You can repeat the bug pretty consistently in Crushbone. Knock an orc to
run health in front of the castle, and when it walks away it'll eventually
reach max range from you (where it would normally stop running). That's when
it starts spamming - I imagine it's losing the "run" command, so thinks it
should charge you and emits the "attack" message. But as soon as it moves
back towards you, it realizes it's low on life and should run, so moves a
little bit away. Repeat, spam, repeat. The orcs actually do try and charge
back at you as they spam, which is why I think this is what's happening.
