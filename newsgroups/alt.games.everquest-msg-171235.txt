Three necros on same raid- the level 60 necros agree about what DOTs 
will be cast. I have Cessation of Corr just like they do and Vexing 
Mordania. We can all land no problem. The SK cannot land Asystole after 
we've landed one on them. But other disease based DOTs of similar level 
land ok.

The SK can land Asystole *before* a Cessation of Corr lands... but it 
wears off as soon as the higher spell lands.
