Tell the enchanter to stop slowing mobs. You are better at that.

Don't shaman and enchanter resist debuffs stack? I seem to recall 
they do but I don't have too much experience in this area. Maybe
someone else can confirm or deny.

You should be sure to keep the tanks in Chloroplast, unless there
is a druid there to do it. Chloro takes a world of load off the healer.

If you still have mana to spare, unleash those nukes. Evocation
practice is good.
