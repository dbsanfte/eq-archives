No offense -- and the implication here is not directed at you -- but
honestly, have you ever met anyone in your life who would characterize
themselves as "by nature a very gullible person"? The most gullible person
probably considers himself to be "by nature a very skeptical person". Such a
statement has all the weight of a preface "I never lie". Sorry, but that
doesn't really move the credibility meter. ;-)

However, the circumstantial evidence you mention does sound compelling. Your
guildmates apparently witnessed this guy hacking his way into exclusive,
flagged zones, so it's not much of a stretch to believe that he could do the
same with GoD. The insta-kill thing seemed unbelievable until I read of the
the ldon box theory. Wow. If that part is true, it's easy to believe that a
good EQ hacker armed with such a mechanic could create an insta-kill effect
that could be used in conjunction with the zone-anywhere hack to accomplish
all of the feats described.

Fascinating stuff, and I would salute the guy for his creativity and
resourcefulness except for the disturbing detail that he's also a joyful
griefer and is proud of it. Why is it that so many of the people capable of
these kinds of creative exploits seem to also have the desire to bring grief
to other players? /shakeshead
