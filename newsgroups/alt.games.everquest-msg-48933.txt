Funny to read about the "exodus" of players from EQ to other MMORPG...
I've just gone the same way... and back. I've found that all the
traditionnal flaws people leaving EQ talk about are actually what
makes EQ a deep and challenging game.
I left this summer, bored with EQ, to try AO. "Wow ! no downtime,
everybody can solo, heal, etc... and no camping either... grab a
quest, it's tailored for you... do it in 30 mn and get the loot you've
chosen as a reward ! great !". WRONG !
All this turns out to make AO dull and boring in my opinion.
Not because the game itself sucks (it's superior to EQ in many ways...
if you have an Uber config). Just because it feels like a cardboard -
disneyland theme park. No real danger, no real involvment and, above
all, absolutly no social interaction or sense of community. Nobody
talks, /shouts are useless, nobody even cares to answer.
Because everyone can solo pretty much (I haven't tested the higher
levels though), it makes grouping even harder than in EQ on a bad day.
Because everybody can just run mission after mission in tailored,
proprietary dungeons, it makes social interactions pointless. Because
you can save your character, the feeling of danger vanishes... "oh
well, I'm going to die. Well, I just saved, so I'll lose only 40k
XP... I'll just do a couple missions to get them back in an hour". 
And worst of all, no Corpse Runs. Don't get me wrong, I bitched and
bitched again at deaths in EQ and the mandatory CRs. But now that in
AO I've had my corpse delivered to my respawn spot by Fedex, I can
tell that it sucks. Some of my best memories in EQ are from difficult
CRs in hostile territories. AO just ruins that.
And finally, the static dungeons that I bitched about too in EQ turn
out to be a blessing for a game world, when they're linked to the
story : why did the Dark Elves send an emissary ? Why did Kobolod get
kicked from such and such place ? Wow ! This really looks like Orcs
are living in here ! etc.... Those dynamic "Wolfenstein 3D like"
dungeons in AO have no credibility, they're in no way linked to the
game world. They're theme park attraction, all look-alike.

Well, anyway, that was my rent : EQ "flaws" make the game challenging
and turn it into a real adventure.

Jo.
