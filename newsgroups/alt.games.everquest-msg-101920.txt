I read so many post where everyone gets all bend about the spelling in EQ.
For example: "k" instead of "okay", or "plz" instead of "please", etc, etc.
I'm sure you've all got your own things you do.

The problem with communicating in EQ is the fact of having to cram all your
thoughts into a keyboard. Words and sentences are definitley verbal
constructs and to translate them to a keyboard interface makes communicating
a complicated thought a challenge.

Everyone should realize that slang and regional dialects are analgous to the
abbrviated words we see in EQ, and no one seems to upset where you say "Hi"
instead of "Hello". EQ is a virtual world, and it's really just human nature
to impose reality based rules into a COMPLETELY fantasty place.

Flame on if you wish, but consider why you are paying $12.95 a month, is it
for engaging conversation, or just to escape the real world for a bit?
