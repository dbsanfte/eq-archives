Actually, I'd like to see more.  I use small, tightly linked sets
to reduce mem time.  I have some with as few as 3  (T_Prep - 
Gift of Xev, Summon Jewelry Bag, Summon Coldstone).

Most of them load gems 1-4 or gems 5-8.  The first ones are named
B_<description>  the second ones T_<description>. 

I'd also like to see a command like

/memsinglespell 2 "Black Steel"

Which would load gem 2 with Black Steel.  The reason is that I'm
very keyboard centric in my use of computers.  (Partly due to my
vision - see other threads :)  I have problems picking up and 
following cursors sometimes, depending on contrast and size).

Yep

Let's say your spellset is named T_Airpet
(on mine this loads gems 5-8 with summon girdle of magi'kot,
summon fist of ixiblat, summon muzzle of mardu, summon ward 
of xegony).

the command is

/memspellset T_Airpet
