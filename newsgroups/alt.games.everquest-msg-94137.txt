I would suggest that instead of making several characters, each a
master in a particular trade, you make one or two characters and make
them masters in several trades.

There is a fair amount of crossover in the tradeskills. For example,
on my way to becoming a master tailor, I also happened to become a
master potter and brewer, and could have been a master smith as well
if I had cared to.
