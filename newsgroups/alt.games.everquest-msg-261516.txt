Yes, that's what I ended up doing -- once, so far.  I actually don't
exit to the patcher all that often.  When I camp I put up my bazaar
mule.  So even an incremental automated download would've been a slow
process.  I was just hoping not to have to fuss with it manually.

Again, I prefer to leave my bazaar mule up for those 8 hours.

I guess this means my wife has another excuse to boot me out of the
bazaar so she can play City of Heroes.  "See dear?  This will give
you an opportunity to download some more of those OOW files." :-)
