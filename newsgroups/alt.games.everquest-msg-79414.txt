Second system
PIII 800
768mb Ram
KyroII 64mb (Prophet 4500)
S/B 128
Res 1024x768, detail Low and some models off

Main is an Athlon Tbird 1200 and a GF3

Think the CPU is up to it but the video card is not but I will likely
upgrade Main to an XP and move TBird to second...see if I can grab a cheap
GF2 pro or ultra

Trouble is, on luclin the FPS is so poor that control is very difficult
(Twilight Sea being the worst zone I have ever been in, to date) meaning I
always use auto in these zones, the amusing thing is that auto can fail in
some of the strangest ways, with my druid running a circle around my warrior
not being able to turn sharp enough to stop in line with him, hilarious at
first but a bit tedious after the 4th time.
