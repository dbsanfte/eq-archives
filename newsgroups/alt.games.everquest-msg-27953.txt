Personally, I prefer not being touched at all by just anyone. I can
let friends give me brief hugs, but won't as much as let myself be
held unless it's done by someone I care deeply about. However, on the
rare occasions that I do have someone like that, I very much want to
be cuddled etc. I just don't demand marriage as a prerequisite for
anything but the sex part :p

She wants marriage without even being in love first. Someone should
send her 800 years back in time, make her a real princess, marry her
off to some knight in an arranged marriage and see if what ensues fits
her fantasy...
And the fact that she wants the freedom to run off and fuck her ex if
she gets the chance while she's searching for this guy willing to
marry her untouched and unloved doesn't exactly make her a pillar of
morality, does it?
