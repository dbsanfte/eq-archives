No. It isn't. See below.

In my version the loots are generally immediately useful (and uber in 
thier own right). Tradeskillers, are optional, but they can make them 
better.

I stipulated that there would be a way to tradeskill someone elses 
no-drop item without them ceasing to be no drop. Getting ripped off will 
not be possible.

And a system that sets its goals too low can achieve them, but nobody is 
satisfied with that either.

WoW's strategy is to make the best items at each level for each slot 
some Tradeskilled and some Looted. Its another decent compromise.
