There are good reasons, depends on the environment.

Well, if they require you to do it, you should do it. Changing your password
regularly is part of your job then.

Go ahead, ask them. A good security officer will have an answer for you. I
hope they do, as I hate lax security departments. But, on the other hand,
they keep me employed...

If he or she doesn't have an explanation for you, I can provide one possible
one: at work, in an environment where you are sharing space with other
people, there is opportunity for your password to be exposed.
Shoulder-surfing (looking over someone's shoulder, or viewing them from a
distance) to read you password off a screen as you type it, or watch your
keypresses, or even just interpret your body or hand movements to make
likely guesses about the password. The more times you are observed entering
the same password, the more likely the observer will be able to guess more
of it, or capture it in its entirety. By changing your password often, you
reduce the opportunity you have to let such information "leak", as well as
reduce the opportunity for a stolen password to be used.

In your home, or wherever you play EQ, this may or may not be a valid
concern. In your workplace, it generally is. It's also "industry best
practice", which also has its plusses on the CYA end of things.
