Ok, for those that were there.....

WTF????

Did anyone figure out what was going on?  If we were not supposed to kill
the specters then they did a piss poor job of conveying that to us....

Especially after death touching me the first time

I as just wondering what happened with that event since I got fed up with it
and left.  Anything cool come of it?
