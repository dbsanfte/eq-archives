The fish is the biggest problem for shure since i take a huge faction
drop, not that i will have much of a faction with them anyway :)
I have opted to go get that stinking wolf, hopefully that will be
easier that going to the temple of life in qeynos, that is as long as
the wolf is not lvl 45 or something :( i can't use a mule for the fish
thing either since i have no empty slots on that server.
