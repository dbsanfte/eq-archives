Very nice.  Got a few new sites from that, thank you.  Just two notes.  
One, when I opened up Miragul's Highway I got a pop-up asking me to 
install Gator.  Haven't gotten it again, but.  You know.  Gator.

The other thing is I just wanted to point out that you've got the 
faction guide section in there twice *g*
