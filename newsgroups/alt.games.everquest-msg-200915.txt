Thanks for all of the suggestions.  It turned out that the two sticks of =
pc2100 DDR memory were not 100% compatible.  It is wise that if you are =
going to upgrade to more memory then make sure the chip supplier is the =
same company. =20

Also, upgrading to more memory does help the game run smoother.  I came =
across the following post by one of the programs who responded to =
compalints after the Luclin launch:

If you're having problems running the new EverQuest expansion pack, then =
join the club. Over on the EverQuest Casters Realm, they post a forum =
thread featurng Scott Hartsman of the EverQuest Live team as he explains =
the memory problems experienced with the Luclin expansion pack. The =
thread started with this gamer's post:=20
  Come on guys would it not have been easier to just write more =
efficient code? You know, when Bill Gates tells me I will need 256MB RAM =
to run a Windows OS I will feel you guys are not being complete idiots =
to require 512MB RAM to run a... GAME! It's an APP for crying out loud!
Scott Hartsman retaliates with his beefy explanation:=20

  Agreed - Unfortunately, it's an app that needs to be able to display =
any one of 500 or so textures on 28 character models, each with 100 or =
so animations, and countless equipment models, at any given time, with =
no previous notice.

  With Luclin, unpacked, there is over 600MB of global data. =
(Animations, Effects, Textures, Models, etc.) The only alternative is to =
have them unpacked and loaded in from disk as new things come into =
range.

  Unfortunately, every time that's been tried in other games, the =
practice has been decried because of the constant, sudden, harsh pausing =
that it causes. :/

  Unfortunately, the code has little to do with it -- The size (2.5MB) =
and quality of EQ's code has only improved with Luclin, and continues to =
do so. Optimization and bug fixes are the priority right now. :)

Thanks again,

Larry
