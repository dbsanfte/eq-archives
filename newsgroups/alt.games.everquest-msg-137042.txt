Another question (from a learning lvl 30 enchanter):  What is more
preferrable, having the MT switch targets when MOBs go after healers, or
letting the enchanter mezz them.    I usually try to get a pretty good view
of the fight, so I can see when the main switches targets.  In good groups,
do all the others know they should switch targets also so I can mezz the
previous MOB, or should a few of the tanks keep pounding on the original
MOB?  The groups I've fought in (admittedly, low level pick up groups) don't
seem to realize that, and if the main tank switches targets, they keep
fighting the original MOB, leaving me just standing there, unable to mezz
anything.
