Bad paragraph formation on my part.  Didn't mean to confuse anyone =)

"Following this logic, shouldn't WK be west from SK?" was aimed at WK being
West of NK.

The whole WK, EK, NK, SK directions can almost be as confusing to a new
player as the OOT.  How do you get to Freeport from BB?  Head west to the
OOT.  But, in the OOT, you go east ( and vice-versa on the way back ).  How
could that have NOT gotten caught in QA during the initial programming?
Beta?

There's a big "Duh" for you.
