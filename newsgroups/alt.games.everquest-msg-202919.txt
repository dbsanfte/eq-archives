The heart of the system is the MB. Dell MBs tend to be on the
conservative side (read slow). They are also limited on how far you
can upgrade the memory, or processor. Many have integrated video and
sound that leave a lot to be desired for gaming. Even those that
aren't integrated have some issues with off the shelf hardware (like
SBLive cards for instance) Their new XPS line looks really good for
gaming (less built in components), but for the price you could get
something by Falcon Northwest or Alienware, with much better hardware
(MB, Case, Powersupply).

My office uses nothing but Dells. I like the brand, but I wouldn't use
it at home.
