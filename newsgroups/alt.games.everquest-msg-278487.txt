There is a second title past Hunter.  Slayer, I think, at 5,000.   If there's
a Destroyer one, it's even more kills than that.

And I don't think anyone cares... it's just, when you see it, you sort of have
to say "_Damn_.... now there's someone with _way_ too much time on their
hands."

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
