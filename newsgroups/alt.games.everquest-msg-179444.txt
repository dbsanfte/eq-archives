Ok, this my very last post,

At end of day, there is good and bad everywhere, so my policy is, as long 
as someone nice to me, i will always be nice back.

One of my nicest male friends was from Iran, and my nicest female friend is 
from malaysia.

and, I am very english, :)

There is one thing that did go through my mind though.....

Would america be so keen to get at sadam if he set all his oil alight like 
he did in kuwait!!!!!

Also, the american goverment was financing the IRA for decades, they were 
financing terrorism openly, i bet they still do on the quiet, but they had 
to look tough after they got bombed.

To quote moby:

I must appologise for our president, just because he is an arrogent facist 
son of a bitch, doesn't meen we the american people are the same way.

And I think the same thing goes for every nation, it's the goverments that 
cause wars, not the people, yet it the people who die for no reason because 
they too scared to stand up and say NO, I not going to die for you, as they 
know that will get them killed for being a traitor.

Die if ya fight, die if ya don;t.

Anyway, far as i am concerned, peace to everyone.

And I now killing this thread, so please, no bother replying to my post. I 
won't see it.

Take care XxX
