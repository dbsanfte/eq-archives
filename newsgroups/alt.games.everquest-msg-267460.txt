Neat game. It runs fine on my system thusfar.

Quick question. How do I map an *attack* key? Yes I know I should read the
documemtation but you guys are sooo great.

I'll be cranking up the graphics and video resolutions soon and see how that
works. THus far the defaults work fine.

Initial impression?  I like it.
