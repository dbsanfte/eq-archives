   I use a MoSS and I love it. I would really love to have a Noctivagant
blade. Wurmslayer is too heavy and the MoSS will deal more damage per
minute. Extra intelligence helps with mana. There is a new drop in
Stoneburnt Mts. called the Spirit Reaver that is almost as good as the MoSS
and is 1hs and procs lifespike. If and this is a big if you can get it to
proc a lot it could possibly out damage the MoSS. But that is a gamble. I
would love to have this blade to work on my 1hs till the Noctivagant blade
drops or I can get one in a trade.

  As far as the shield I would say the Atramentous Shield is the best. A
cracked Darkwood if you need the strength or a Clay Guardian shield if you
want AC.
