   I went back to Nektulos Forest to check there.  The Large Spiders are
dropping a fourth to half what they were a few weeks ago, but that is
still 2 to 3 times the rate I found in EK.  

   I also killed about 15 spiderlings and got about 15 spiderling silks
with the range being from 0 to 4 per drop.  (Yes, I did auction for the
spiderling silks several times but nobody even responded.  So I had to
hunt them myself.  It's pretty bad when a level 23 character has to hunt
the newbie area to get silk threads and silk swatches.

   I tried to trade some wolf-hide boots, AC 4, wearable by any
race/class for spiderling silk.  No response.  I even tried to give the
boots to a newbie wizard.  No response.

   On a happier note, I killed 15 to 20 bears and 3 YKs and got 1 LQ
pelt, 2 HQ pelts, and 1 Grizzly pelt.  If the rates are still holding,
that's 50+ PP worth of pelts.  
   I saved one guy's life in the nick of time.  Literally after he
dropped, I killed the skel that had dropped him.  I then bandaged him
and had a friend.  Even though the 10 minutes of talking with him was
more response than I got from the rest of the zone all evening, it was a
good feeling.  One new friend a week isn't bad.

   So, while I did feel bad about the nerfed spider silk drops, I think
I had a profitable evening, both in assets and in socializing.

   Well, I guess I better quit digressing.
