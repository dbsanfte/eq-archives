I have done something like this with an Enchanter, (not the tracking thing
tho).  He is lvl 8 and I doubt I will ever take him to 9.
I use him for viewing new zones I am going to.  He can invis., and illius.,
so he is not KOS.  I got to see the Throne Room in CB while it was being
camped by others.  I have wandered around HHK without being killed by Orcs
and Gnolls.
The bigest plus is if I do get killed, I still have all my stuff!

I kinda wish I had made a Ranger for the tracking part.  That could be very
handy.
