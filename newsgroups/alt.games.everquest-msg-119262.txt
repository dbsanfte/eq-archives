No, it was all within a period of 5 minutes or so.

My point wasn't about covering it up, but that there are people out there in
positions of power who do fucked up stuff like that.

Sorry I don't recall it being a guide or gm, my bad but it doesn't hold much
relevance with me what their specific title is (excluding the server lead
gm).

I've had an apprentice-guide rescue me from an ST bug (ST is a no-go zone
for EQ staff, whatever their term is for it) so I know its not always
important, or limiting in what they can/will do.

Well looking at James guild, they have taken her down at least 3 times in
recent weeks, we too have killed Tunare 3 times in the last month (last
night would have been the 4th).

Her being absent would most likely to be with her being killed, she is on a
week long spawn timer (give or take several hours)

Of course we checked she was up, we wouldn't undertake the zone clearing
otherwise (if she popped mid-way thru, she would re-pop the entire zone
anyway)

Tunare initially pops in her tree, when you agro her, a killable form spawns
in the forest, which does a call to arms and spams the zone.   A common way
of ensuring the zone is cleared (or pulling the last few hiding mobs) is to
agro Tunare, then when all her creatures are there, clear your agro (fd),
and somebody else agros her minions.

We had her spawned in the forest, so there was no bug there either.

Most of us checked /who all through the raid.  Its interesting to see 35
people in the zone for 8 hours, then as you announce the guardians and Ali
are coming, the zone count shoots upto 62.

Its not possible a couple of groups slipped by whilst we were busy - for
starters Ali the elder was still up (ae silence, dispell). Theres no way
your killing Tunare with him as an add.   They would also have spammed the
zone during battle (for as long as they have agro on somebody)

Tunare is also a massive high end raid, its not something a few groups can
quietly slip into a zone and kill.
There are 3 guilds on Prexus who can(have) killed Tunare, so keeping track
of that wouldn't be difficult.  And an influx of 40-50+ nonguildies into the
zone would be impossible to miss.

Somebody else killing her is the one thing were 100% about (100% certain
that nobody else did)
