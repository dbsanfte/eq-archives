    They disable the stew quest on all new servers. Here's why: I started a
new HFL DRU on my server once, as an experiment. It took me a minute to find
my way out of the newbie burrow you start in. From there it took me five
minutes to hit level two using only the stew quest, and with NO moving the
NPCs closer. Level three was achieved in a similarly short span. And I was
getting coin for each time I did the quest, enough that I estimated I could
purchase all my level five spells once I dinged to five. That's just too
easy.
