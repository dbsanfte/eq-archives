And sometimes the person who originally did the inviting (i.e. the one
"on top of the list") isn't the one calling the shots. And whether
someone is full of shit if they corrects someone playing another class
doesn't go with being the group inviter, group leader or even playing
that other class - it has to do with nothing other than that person's
knowledge of that class compared with the person they're picking
on/correcting, and their manners.
