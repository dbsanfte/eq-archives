The old where to hunt at 24th now that PC is greening out question. 
If you do some searches, you can find lots of answers.  My Wizard went
to Maru Seru mostly but there are probably better places. 24th to 29th
are very tough levels for Wizards.  At 29th you will get Bonds of
Force which makes Wizards much easier to play.
