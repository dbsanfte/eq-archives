I decided to reroll a bard, moving to Freeport from Qeynos, tried to get 
him to level 5 (he'd been there before) but died, so I attempted the run 
at level one.

I went QH, WK, NK, SK, LR, RM, Feerrot... and died when some zombies 
aggroed me as I tried to cross the stream; in the water with a swim 
skill of one there was no getting away from them.

Since the run took me 45 minutes to that point, and bodies decay in 30 
minutes, there was no chance at all of recovering the gear (all 5 pp 
worth, lol); sadly I'd already discovered that deleting and making a 
different character with the same name doesn't work; bodies poof when 
you delete.

Of course I knew this going in, and was going to delete and reroll in 
Freeport anyway, so no big deal, I just had to give it a try.

Splendid
