Skills have *nothing* to do with safety margin.   If you know
HOW to quad, you can quad.  So you don't die when things
go wrong.  You *still* know HOW to quad.   You *still*
know HOW to root/nuke.  You still know HOW to root/rot.
The *only* difference is that you don't die (or be forced to
zone) when things go badly wrong.

Take your druid example.   So you were killing a couple, got
an add, ended up scraping by and killing them all.  Okay.
Now take a KEI'd 24 druid.   They wouldn't be killing the
same mobs, if they're smart.  They'd be killing high-blues
(or whites or yellows) routinely.   Believe it or not, people
with KEI *still* get in over their heads or get adds or
whatever.  They just do it with higher-level mobs.  So I
guess that makes them "better" players than you, right?

People with KEI still have to manage their mana.  The limit is
just higher.   People with KEI still have to know how to
handle bad situations.  They just have a deeper reserve.

You're making the "twink argument."   Take your druid and
someone else's who has them maxxed out on WIS, some
FF items, a lot of +mana items.   Would they need KEI
to trivialize the same encounters you normally face?  Nope.
KEI's no different.

The real difference is that anyone who knows KEI (and can
afford it) almost certainly won't be killing low blues if they
have higher-blues available.  They're not competing with
your 24 druid at 24;  they're competing with 28 druids.  And,
yes, at that level of challenge, they're arguably learning more
than you about resists, how to handle themselves, etc.
