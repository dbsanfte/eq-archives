Sounds like you're applying a specific standard there, Faned.  Would
you care to tell me what the standard is?  And why the standard would
not apply in the situation where the court would be forcing someone to
pay one thousand dollars in exchange for nothing?

See: "I missed the point and use stupid smileys to cover up my
inadequacy".  My point, which you've managed to miss, is that if you
change the parameters of the hypothetical, it no longer applies to the
point we're trying to discuss.  In order to discuss this particular
point, the pebble has to be worthless.  Similarly, I can't have been
extorted or otherwise defrauded into this deal, because it renders the
hypothetical inapplicable to our discussion.

Speaking of inapplicable:

You must be really stupid and credulous if you think that would be my
defense.  I don't need the judge to let me out of the contract,
because following a *very fundamental* principle of contract law, no
contract existed.  I'd just need to cite caselaw that any *first week*
law student is familiar with in order to demonstrate that no contract
existed because there was no adequacy of consideration.

Cf. Schnell v Nell 17 Ind. 29, 79 Am. Dec. 453 (A consideration of
$0.01 does not support the promise to pay $600)

Also look at Second Restatement of Contracts, Section 71

"but it is not enough the the promise induces the conduct of the
promisee or that the conduct of the promisee induces the making of the
promise; both elements must be present, or there is no bargain. 
Moreover, a mere pretense of bargain does not suffice, as where there
is a false recital of consideration [pay careful attention here, sir]
or where the purported consideration is merely nominal. In such cases
there is no consideration and the promise is enforced, if at all, as a
promise binding without consideration."

That last sentence concerns contracts without consideration where one
party either relied on the promise to that party's detriment, or one
party received an unjust benefit from the promise.  Neither of these
examples applies in our little hypothetical.

There is a slew of caselaw cited at the end of the restatement to
support it, which I'm not interested in including here.  If you're
really curious, and refuse to accept the Restatement as "valid law",
you may go right ahead and debunk the relevant caselaw cited
individually.

Fire your translator.

Is there some reason you're citing the Uniform Commercial Code here? 
Are you aware that that generally covers merchant contracts and
applies different standards between those and the possible contracts
between two individuals who aren't merchants?

And what's with the word "shipment" there?  That's a very odd word to
use if they meant "delivery".  And goods!  Does a worthless pebble
rise to the definition of "goods" as they're defined by the Uniform
Commercial Code?

Hint: If they wanted to use the word "delivery", they would have done
so, rather than using the shockingly vague and improper "shipment". 
Your cavalier attitude toward the definition of words in statutes is
what separates an actual attorney from some dopey-ass hack who
randomly reads Mommy's book on the Uniform Commercial Code and thinks
that means he knows Contract Law.

But since we're on the UCC, turn Mommy's book back one page, that's
right, back to Section 2-204.  Got it?  Now let's see what it says.

UCC Section 2-204:  Formation in General
(1) A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient
to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes
the existence of such a contract.

(end quote)

The particularly relevant portion of that statute is "in any manner
sufficient to show agreement", but if you were actually versed in
Contract Law, rather than being some schmuck with Mommy's book on
Contract Law, you'd know that consideration must exist for there to be
a valid contract.  In this case, because all 42's giving up is a
worthless pebble, there was no adequate consideration for a contract
to exist.  Again, this is basic Contract Law.  This isn't first year
law student stuff, this is *first week* law student stuff.

No adequate consideration existed, and hence no contract exists, so
hence UCC Section 2-206 doesn't apply, no matter how you try to
contort it to apply to this situation.

Oh, you're a funny man.  Dance for me again, funny man.
