This is kinda funny, just saw on lums, the funny part being that
verant used it verbatim (the rewording):

http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2274

"When John Smedley, of Sony Online Entertainment began posting to the
thread, Flex had this to say to him: 

Do this: 

Account Security 
As the population of Norrath increases, so too do issues regarding
stolen or compromised accounts, and/or accounts that have been
transferred from one player to another in violation of the User
Agreement. These issues - and the time it takes to investigate and
attempt to resolve them - hugely detract from the time that SOE's
customer service staff have to devote to providing quality customer
service to issues that impact upon the gameplay experience.
Accordingly, SOE must remind all players that: 

(1) Account security -- whether it be password protection, running
virus checks, disabling file sharing, or any other element of making
sure accounts are not stolen or compromised -- is the sole
responsibility of the account owner. 
(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to
SOE will be *suspended*, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player
found to be involved in an account theft will have any and all of
his/her accounts banned. 
Prior to banning any accounts reported as compromised, we will conduct
a thorough review of the accounts in question and determine the
appropriate course of action on those accounts. Accounts will only be
banned based on information gathered through our investigation and not
merely as a result of external allegations. 
- The EverQuest Customer Service Team

"See the difference? 


The response was brief and to the point: 

You know what. 

I do see the difference. 

I'll actually bring it up on Tuesday. Maybe this statement can be
reworded.
