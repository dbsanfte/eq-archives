Yes. You can give them 4 items at a time no problem, they will
equip it if they can wear the item. Just don't give them the armor
in the bag. NPCs don't handle items in bags well.

Yes but only the AC and hit points will help them.
The mana and the focus effect does nothing for them.

The mana might help the high level fire pets that are wizards
but have never seen any proof one way or the other.

Nice thing is pets ignore the LORE tag so you can give them 2 rings
and 2 earrings of the same type.

Pets will not equip anything that has a NO DROP tag, they just destroy them.
Which is too bad because there are some nice items you could give them
sometimes.
