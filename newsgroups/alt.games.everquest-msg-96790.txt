Have you considered the heart spiders in upper Guk? Amazing silk supply,
and good at that level I believe. (Been a while. Not sure.) I know
druids aren't famous for dungeon work, so I'm not sure how they would be
to solo (breaking the spawns can be a bear).  But if your frog faction
is good, there's not much else to bother you in the area. Might be worth
looking into, though not having played a druid, I've no clue how one
would go about soloing them.
