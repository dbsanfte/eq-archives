There are 3 cobalt drakes  roaming CS  they all have a certain path they run
by,  also named wyvern(Yvolcarn) and named drake(azurerake) will assist
their Wyvern / drake friends even if you have max ally CoV faction

unnamed wyverns and drakes wont give faction hits  but the named one will.

oh and named wyvern cant be snared, dunno if named drake can though
