This is typical for Time magazine.  They long ago ceased
being a weekly news magazine, and made an editorial
decision to pander for sales via sensationalism
and pre-planned agendas.

Examples of the nadir of their unprofessionalism
include their "cyberporn" issue (complete sensationalism,
and based on a bogus "study" to boot), and their outright
admission that they use their magazine to push for
gun control (instead of simply reporting facts and
letting readers decide for themselves what solutions
might be necessary or appropriate).
