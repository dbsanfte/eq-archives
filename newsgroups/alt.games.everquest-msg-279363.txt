You pretty much summed up why I, and many others I'm sure, raid.  =)

Tanks are of course the most gear dependent, but at the same time have the
highest quality bazaar gear available.  I reference my twink warrior I
mentioned at the very start of this thread.  Being so gear dependent, they
do have to be willing to spend spend spend and camp camp camp to be decently
equipped.

There are guilds that raid once a week, at off times, have no attendance
requirements, work on a "NBG" rather than points system for loot, etc. 
Finding the one that fits a large set of "bad" requirements would probably
be rather difficult, but just one "bad" requirement is dealt with easily.

There are, hinted at above, guilds that operate in most all timezones. 
My server has a Hawaiian and an Australian timezone raiding guild.  Both are
Time+.  I know of Asian and Euro guilds as well.

Limited play time is irrelevant to the discussion.  I don't even think it is
debatable that time = effort = reward in this game (and most others).  You
cannot expect to be equipped like me if you play 1/2 as much.

See above.  I sympathize, in the same way that I sympathize with the
under-funded, under-equipped racers that have to compete in F1 and Nascar
against teams willing to throw millions of dollars towards winning a $50k
purse.  But this is an aspect of the game that can't be changed *enough* to
ever allow you to achieve what an every day player can (notice "player" not
"raider").  Those with very limited play time must be content to stay 3 to 4
expansions behind the curve, taking advantage of the droppables and "easy"
single-groupables from the newer expansions to make their progression
through the earlier progressions faster so they don't fall behind any
further.  They can never catch up.

But they won't be "playing by themselves".  Because surely there are many
people with similar circumstances.  If it *is* only one guy...  screw him. 
As a wise, pointy-eared man once said, the needs of the many outweigh the
needs of the one.  =)
