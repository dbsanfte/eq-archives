I was in an LDoN, and unexpectedly I had EQ just crash.. every worked for
some time, but all of a sudden I got a lil window that said EQ had an
unexpected crash? or something close to that, and just went back to
desktop.. I waited a few then got back on.. this is first time this has ever
happend to me, has anyone else seen this too??

This is over and above the logging into blackness. but I zoned into BB, from
Gfay and it all seemed ok after that. Also at zone lines I noticed some
texture problems ( which were minor but new since patch )... the EQ Client
crash is what scares me..
