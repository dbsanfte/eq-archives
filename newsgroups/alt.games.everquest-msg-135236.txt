Actually, for the "most part" this is a mellow approach, *but*!...
it contains a few words in which I have issue with.  Lets look...

"Your actions can not harm Joe in any way".
..I can kinda go along with that one. (because of the word "harm" which
implies "physical" harm.

But then you have this dilly-whopper:
"Further, your behavior cannot in any way differentiate Joe"
Two *BIG* problems here (either you are not aware, or conviently hid)

"behavior" & "differentiate ".  ...So in essenance you are saying that
ones "behavior can not differentiate anothers behavior", right ??
Thats messed up, wrong, dangerous, incorrect, and plain whacked!

With "anothers behavior" being defined as "being gay", the term
"differentiate" means that he is being singled out as being "different",
right?  Well?!, Hello?! - he *IS* different - he likes to do guys!
Surmising that he is somehow *not* different than say "me" whould imply
that I *TOO* like to do guys which in not only sick, but BZZT, "*WRONG*"!!

Look, the the whole issue that I, and many like me have, is this
"gross misassociation" that is happening.  And the more IMPORTANT
thing that keps getting overlooked about this whole thing is, not
only is being gay a BEHAVIOR, its a BEHAVIOR that isn't even being
DISPLAYED on a school yard, plubic, etc....  ergo, if you didn't TELL
anyone you were gay, they wouldn't even KNOW Joe was gay!!
