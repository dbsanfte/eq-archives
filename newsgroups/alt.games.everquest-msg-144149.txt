You have complete heal now, with that you will be snagged up in a group =
in the dreadlands without much of a wait, yes even at level 34.  As a =
cleric you will just be buffing, healing etc... keep root and gate =
memmed in case you really get in a bind.  Hang around the North Wall of =
Karnor's castle, if you get in a jam you can always zone inside.

The XP here rolls in fast, and unlike dawnshraud, the mobs here actually =
carry money.  If it is xp you are after, and don't want to hang around =
long, go to Dreadlands in Luclin.
