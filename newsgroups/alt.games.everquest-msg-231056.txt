My main is a Ranger so it is possible that Rangers, who can probably
benefit the most from Dex, purposefully have more trouble finding the
high dex gear than other classes.  Stamina, with no effort, is over
200.  Dex is a pathetic 155 or 160 with regular gear on.  Dex, for me,
has not been as easy to come by as Stamina.
