My apologies, but I think you know what I was getting at ;). I'm
surprised indeed that in Brum you can't get it, just goes to show....

That's what I've now gone with. I was an ex CWC customer and as you
probably know we were the last to get access to NTLWorld. It was
fortunate that they have just got around to letting ex CWC subscribers
in my area use NTLWorld. Ironically the CD popped through my letter
box the very day AOL UK pulled this stunt.

As you say two hours is indeed workable, I've already explained the
situation to my regular hunting partners/guildees in both EQ and DAoC
and they are happy enough with it as long as I keep them informed of
when I'm likely to disappear and need to re-log.

Hehe, nor here in backward Norwich either, alas.

safe travels and good hunting :).
