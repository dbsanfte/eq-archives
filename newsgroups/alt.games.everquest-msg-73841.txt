/assist is a hotbutton that needs to be made by damned near every class very
early in their career.  Except in VERY rare cases EVERYONE should be on the
same critter.

In your particular case you should have gotten off that critter and beat on
the melee.  After the fight inform them to make an "/assist mike szewczyk's
character's name here" hotkey before you pull again, and then USE it.

Any enchanter you're grouped with in the future will appreciate it.

Since you're a new tank and apparently new to the game (welcome, btw :) )
I'll give you one more piece of info 'cause I still have 5 minutes stuck at
work that I need to kill. :)  If you have an enchanter in the group, your
job is to kill stuff...NOT to save the healer or enchanter's life.  They
take care of one another.  It has nothing to do with this thread, but, like
I said, I have time to kill. :)
