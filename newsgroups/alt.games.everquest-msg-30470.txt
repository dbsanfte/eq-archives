Last week I was in a 4-person pick-up group in LOIO at the back entrance to
the fort and after our 4th kill, I get a tell from the Rogue in the group
saying: "Loot up."  I set back "Oh, are we doing Alpha?"  He says "Nope,
FFA, but I know you casters don't get your fair share."

First time that has ever happened - a non-caster worrying about how much
loot I get.


After that, a Guild-mate ( Wiz ) and I went to Sol A and partied with 4
people he knew.  Great group - Chanter, Wiz, Bard, Cleric, Rogue, Warrior.
The other 4 people all had high level characters and didn't give a squat
about loot and wanted he and I to loot everything.  We played again the next
day, and it was the same deal.

Those were 2 very profitable sessions in Sol A - loot-wise and friend-wise.
The other 4 people were great players and had quality senses of humor.  I
enjoyed every minute of it, except for when the cleric died =(  I always
feel at fault when that happens.
