    Based on the short experience I've had with KC, you're wasting time
there at any level, especially with a solo capable class.

    Dreadlands got me to 52, in (I'm certain) far less playing time than it
would've taken in Karnor's. Zero downtime groups or soloing absolutely crap
on waiting for spawns in a full group and getting trained once an hour. Loot
in DL is anything from uber tho, basically it pays for the costs of soloing
and that's all. Although as a bard your soloing costs might be little or
nothing.

Cheers,
James
