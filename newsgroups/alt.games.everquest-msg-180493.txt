Now, your just getting crazy aren't ya. I use  to group with a  female
Erudite Mage named" BlakMagik" she was a great person to play with.
Or what if I made a panther Kitty bard and named her "BlackKat", would
that offend you.
Now don't get me wrong I'm not trying to start any thing I would just
like to know what your tolerance is , because like I said if I ran
into a female Erudite named"Choklitdrop"I wouldn't even read
anything into it.
And I'll let you know how it goes downtown, considering my race (or
sub-race LOL) I don't think I'll have any problem.
Oh and by the way calling someone  "bubba" might be considered
rasict in some parts. And my ass isn't pink.
