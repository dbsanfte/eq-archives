    Hunting in KC, you will end up KOS at the Outpost. You have a choice
coming up: get everything you need out of the Outpost and destroy the
faction, or preserve it and hunt elsewhere. There are other places to hunt,
but none will be as convenient as KC at your level. If you destroy Outpost
faction, though, it'll be expensive - you'll have to get all your Kunark
spells before you kill the faction, and you'll likely need to buy a
Faithstone to have someplace to bank at the end of the day. (I've been
sorely tempted recently to make a Faithstone, buy a Manastone and become a
soloing fiend.)

> 2. Is it safe to port to SFG and the usual spots?

    No, druid ports are likely bad for your health (depending on what NPCs
are at the port you take). Get Invis before you port and you should be OK to
run out of range, though.
