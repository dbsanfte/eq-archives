Two raids last week. Full pop on first floor both times, first time full
pop of all bosses on second floor. Didn't notice anything different and
we use the same breakin as you. Went pretty much business as usual both
times.

45 minutes to set up after breakin? Do you have an epic cleric with you?
If so, that seems pretty long. Mostly, we're up and running within
fifteen or twenty of the first group going up, and a lot of that is just
arguing over who get's to group with me. ;-)

(KSing the KS groups since 2000)

probably more productive."
