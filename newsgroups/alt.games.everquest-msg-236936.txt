I am still fairly new compared to most of you that post, my highest is
a 37 level although I do have two 24s and a 10 going aswell, Is it
worth me spending money on GoD considering my 37 wont get to 50 for
what I would guess would be 2 or even 3 months due to play time - I
also think that old world is great no such thing as "camp check" down
there!!

Thank you in advance :)
