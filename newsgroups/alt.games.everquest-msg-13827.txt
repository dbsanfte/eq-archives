Wait a moment:  Define "skills".

Different skill types rely on different character stats to
determine their speed of increase.

Some do, some don't.  It is very well documented that an
Agility below 75 incurs a substantial AC penalty, for
example.

Yes, but ONLY for TRADESKILLS, like Pottery, Smithing, Baking,
etc.  Not for weapon skills, defensive skills, etc.

Depends -- which skills were you watching?


>Can anyone confirm that WIS is used for skills if it is higher than INT.

For tradeskills, yes.  For fighting skills, no.

If you want suggestions for the best way to "spend" your
starting stat points, see:  http://eq.castersrealm.com
Look in their "starting guides" area.
