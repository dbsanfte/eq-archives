To be honest Bizbee, it is a bit ambiguous on that subject, I am guessing
that the relevant section is this one:


    - If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
      summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
      enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
      sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
      Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the
      postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a
      response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context
      helps everyone.  But do not include the entire original!


Specifically it says to summarize the original at the top, or include just
enough...to give a context.  To me at least, that can be interpretted two
ways.

1.  If you summarize, put it at the top.

2.  Include enough text to give a context for your answers.

Personally, I bottom post, and prefer it, but I can see where the RFC is
ambiguous.
