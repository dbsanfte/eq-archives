	There are dangers, sure, but you can definitely start
	Velious at 30 (group, or even solo, depennding on class)

	With some practice, you can single pull snow cougars near the
	gnome pirate outpost.  You can also make your way across Iceclad
	to the eastern waste, and to the entrance of Crystal Caverns.
	Right at the entrance, there are 3 spawns that you can rotate
	quite nicely with a small group, or even solo by 34.
