I tend to doubt it, I suspect this was a coincidence.  At most it was a
peculiar incompatibility on your end that happened to be fixed by the patch.
But I find that unlikely.  As others have said, there were reports of a major
cable getting cut in the Pacific, maybe they finally fixed it.

Not that it matters, at least you can play now :)
