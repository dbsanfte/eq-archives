Who did?  I just looked the thread up on google, I don't see anybody 
asking that.  Justisaur corrected you on the issue of there being *no* 
newbie armor for iksars besides BLs, but he did add that it wasn't like 
other newbie armor.  You apparently misunderstood him and thought he 
meant some other type of armor, because you said it was for "20-30 
level" players.  I pointed out what he was most likely referring to.

If you get a full suit of curscale (which was absurdly easy, I mean the 
little critters are *everywhere* in the newb area) you get a boost of 36 
to your AC, a small boost to every sv except magic, and the weight is a 
whole, oh, 7 pounds or so.  I can't remember what the bag weighed, but 
there were vendors right there on the field, and heck, it's not like 
you're looting 10 lb items at that level anyway.  I'd be weighted down 
with coin way before I'd be weighted down with items.  "Ooh, this 
spiderling silk is breakin my back, man."

Now it is true that necros got shafted, but that's a different statement 
than "They haven't implemented newbie quests for the following races: 
... Iksars (except Beastlords)"


And finally, wtf does a graphic have to do with 'decent'?
