I'm just about to turn 39th level.  =)  That means I finally get my first XP
rez.  What I'd like to know is where is the best zone to make money doing
39th level XP rezzes, how much do you make on average, and what's the best
way to get paid and silence the beggars?

I've been warned by clerics to go /role or ANON once I hit 39 to avoid
beggars and only reply to requests for rezzes that state a plat amount in
their shouts/ooc's, take the money first, and then do the rez.

I've got my eye on a lot of items (+7 WIS velium rings, Gauntlets of the
Black, etc.) that I'd like to buy for my cleric and am hoping to be able to
afford them using my XP rez money.  Oh, I also plan to do the cleric bracer
quests once hitting 39 thus I'll  be traveling through many zones.
