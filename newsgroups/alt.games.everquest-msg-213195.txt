Of course, you are right.  As of today, I suggest that we stop allowing 
people to buy sharp objects that they might leave lying around for a kid 
to injure themselves with.  We need to make sure that all electrical 
outlets have some automatic safety cover, so that we don't have to rely 
on parents to childproof them.  No more objects small enough that a child 
might choke to death on them.  I'm sure I missed a few.

You cannot make the world 100% safe for everyone.  Do I feel bad about 
things like this happenning?  Absolutely.  Do I think the solution is to 
make the world one big happy safe place for everyone, with no hazards at 
all?  Fuck no.
