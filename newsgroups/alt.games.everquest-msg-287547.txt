Actually, I am thinking about starting EQ2. I played WoW for that last
two years. I was in a raiding guild and have leveled almost every
character class in the game. However, recently I have been getting
more and more frustrated with the amount of immature "jackass"
players. So I decided to leave wow. I put about a week of play in on
LOTRO, the user base was very mature and helpfull, however, I really
just wasn't feeling it.

Looking everything over with EQ2 it looks like a great game, did I
mention a REALLY great game. How is the user base? is it full of
kiddies like WoW? I might mention that I only played on a PVP server
during my entire WoW lifespan.

I am downloading the 14 day trial as we speak. If I go and buy it will
I want to get ALL the expansions right off the bat? Is there some sort
of "Battle Chest" type of package that already has it all?

Also, right off the bat I will probably want to pick a good server and
Mature guild.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

Jerry
