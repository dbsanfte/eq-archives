The way it works is you ask a Scion for a port stone that takes you to the
moon (about every 15 mins).  You land in the Nexus which has 4 "arms" off of
it.  Each arm has a teleporter to a different area:  Odus (Toxx Wiz Spire),
Faydark (GFay), Antonica (NK) and Kunark (Dreadlands).  They send you back
to the Old World about 5 minutes after you arrive.  Worst case scenario
would be about a 20 minute trip from any point to any other point.
