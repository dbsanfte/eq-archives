Hehe, i totally agree. Im also sometimes baffles by persons, usually in BB and
GFay, who want a port to WC when in port into BB, and i have time to run to
GFay to invite a guild member, to CB to to kill Crush and DVinn for some stuff
for the guild, run to LFay to see if anyone is killing brownies, so i can beg
parts (hehe, i beg myself too *s*), and head back to BB. And i can see the
person still there shouting for a port to WC. At that time he could have taken
the boat around 3 times.
