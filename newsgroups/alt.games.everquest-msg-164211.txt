Heh, you've been playing EQ too long James.  That's just the sort of
bizarre solution I'd expect from SOE.  But if you remove the hate list
from the question, and simply make offensive magics (or even most/all
magics) take a very long time to prepare and execute it would change
things a lot.  Buffs and pets would be the root of magical power (and
you can easily prevent pets from making melees dispensible by limiting
pet buffs), with casters maybe able to prepare a single spell for quick
use (nuke or evac?  nuke or evac?  damn I hate decisions).  Actually,
something like that, only a slight modification from Dennis' "magic
must be useless in combat", might work very well.  If it were totally
"useless in combat" the game would likely fail to attract an audience,
but if you essentially had one shot (maybe two or even three in a very
long battle), but otherwise had no particular limitation on magic use.
No mana at all, your limits are casting time vs. spell duration, one
spell loaded for quick cast ("loading" a spell would be a self-only
buff), move while casting and lose concentration (yes, you can set up
an ambush so your caster can "load" evac and prep a nuke, for example).
That would create the interdependence between casters and melees that
their moronic "let's fuck all melees via Bind Afinity" bullshit was
supposed to foster.
