Level*2 + Level*Wisdom/5

I don't understand where you come up with Level*5 in your extrapolation.

If Level=15 for example, and Wisdom=100, then, ignoring the Level*2 part for
the moment

You can evaluate it as

15*100=1500   (Level*Wisdom)
1500/5=300      (Level*Wisdom)/5

or

100/5=20          (Wisdom/5)
15*20=300       Level*(Wisdom/5)

The result is the same either way.

Algebraically, (x*y)/z is equivalent to x*(y/z), thus, no need for
parenthesis, as it does not matter in which order you evaluate it.

On the other hand, x*y/z is not equivalent to (x*y)/(x*z).

You have managed to convince me that you are not a mathematician.

As I posted in an earlier response, I wrote the formulae correctly the first
time.  I would highly recommend brushing up on your algebra.
