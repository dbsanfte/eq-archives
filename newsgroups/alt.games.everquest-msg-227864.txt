Couple more things.
1. Always have only *one* person doing anything to the box at a time.  The
only time I have ever had anyone die was when two people typed /inspect at
the same time and we both critically failed.
2. Always have at least one person with remove poison already memmed and
ready to cast it on the player most likely to die.  If you are a bard then
aria of asceticism is nice with flute.
