Sounds like it is,

"Working as intended".

Only not by verant, more by microsoft. Clearly they're going to encourage
video card developers to develop for the newest thing. Although since the
video card vendors are in a feature race they probably don't need much
prompting. All of which gives microsoft a nice lever to obsolete win95,
since some naughty people haven't been upgrading when MS wants you to.

It's very neat, but surely in this Verant was as much a victim as those
who wanted to continue using win95.
