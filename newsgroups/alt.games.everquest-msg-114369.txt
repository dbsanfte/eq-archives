Hmm...curious about two new monk quests:

1) Guildmaster asks to kill Filandad in East Commons and return his headband
along with 2 orc toes.

Q) Got the sash.  Where are the toes?  I have killed everything in the zone
and all I get are severed orc feet.  Don't want to lose the sash upon a
botched turning.

2) Finished all Stonefist armor quests except cap.  Can't get the recipe to
combine.

Q) Anyone have any success?

Also curious what other quests I can go work on.  Any thoughts?  Finished
the orange sash or order, can't do the red for a while.  Only level 12.


Thanks
