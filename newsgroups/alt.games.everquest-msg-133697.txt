Well... they're pretty much the same on just stats... so you have to look at
other things.

If the ratio is the same... go for the lower delay, because you will swing
more often (and have more chance to keep your skill maxxed out... in this
case the Scimitar)

If there's a special effect, go for that. (the Scimitar is MAGIC... you can
hit wisps and ghouls with it)

If you're better with a particular TYPE of weapon, use that. (uhh, as a low
level Druid you're probably better at using the Warhammer at the moment
because it's 1-hand blunt, like the club you had when you started)

If there's another weapon that you want to have in the future, use a weapon
of the same class to keep that skill maxxed so when you get your NEW weapon,
you can use it right away. The Druid Epic Weapon is also a Scimitar, but
that's a long way off for you yet... and in the meantime there are some nice
1-hand blunt weapons that will be within your budget before then, so in this
case, that's not much help :o)

On balance... the Scimitar (better effect, lower delay) is slightly ahead of
the Warhammer (higher skill).
Don't abandon the Warhammer just yet, tho... keep it for practice... but use
it less than the Scimitar.
