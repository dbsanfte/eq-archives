Well, this was an interesting thread tonight, you two. And it puts me in
a tough place. Nips (a.k.a. Arolpin, a.k.a Jeremiah) is a good friend of
mine, IRL. We don't even really play EQ together, though I did recently
start a chanter on his server.

But on this one, though I definitely wouldn't have put it in the same
terms, I kind of have to lean towards Bizbee's take. This isn't, by the
way, to say that you're both not assholes. You are. Though of course
neither will ever approach *my* level of assholeish accomplishments.

But as to passwords and such, I can only say this. I have a friend (who
Nips has met IRL) named Mark. I love that guy like a brother, and would
about trust him with my life. When he was down on his luck at one point,
I let him move in with us and live in our house for five months. Never
regretted it. He had keys, full access, the whole works. He also had the
use of my computer while we were at work. And you know what? I set up a
whole seperate set of user accounts for him so when he fired it up he
could log on with his own username and password for whatever he wanted
to do. Did I not trust him? Say that if you like, but people do stupid
shit sometimes. Maybe drunk, maybe tired. Who knows? Anyway, I found it
more comfortable to have him use his own access and not share mine.
Sometimes strong fences do make better neighbors.

Of course, that being said, there is obviously one person who *does*
have my passwords, EQ access, etc. etc. etc.  But of course, she also
has my insurance policies, title to the house, truck, etc. If she
decided to fuck me over, my new Cobalt armor would be the least of my
worries. I think even Biz would agree with that.

Oh, and I think Sassy, my fat cat, has my password. She's often sitting
on my lap when I type it in. But thus far she's shown no interest in
electronics beyond shitting in your stereo headphones. (Ok... name THAT
obscure reference!)

Anyway, I get along great with the folks in my guild and we do all sorts
of outrageous shit together. But they don't have my account info. Nor
will they. I just think it's not *needed* by anyone. I know Arolpin
cited some very good examples of CR needs in VP, etc. And if it comes to
that, I'll have to take my lumps and deal. Maybe I'm the paranoid one.
But I think that's over a line I don't want to cross.
