I've really gotta remember to check the Verant board more often.

Well, I still don't think it should be too much of a problem getting moved.
I have no idea how many Europeans play, and don't know if that'll be better
ping for Japan (I'm guessing the US would be, but I don't have a globe
handy) but I KINDA doubt if they'll have to worry about more than 10-20k
requests.

But yeah, I could be totally wrong, so do the /movelog as soon as it becomes
available. <g>
