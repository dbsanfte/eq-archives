I'm not sure if such a thing already exists, but I've got an idea for what
I'd rather have than just a guide.
    What about a book that is just very good quality prints of a zone,
including every 100, 200, 500, or 1000 LOC as appropriate for that zone.  As
well as a listing of what is at each building.  More like a hard copy of the
info on EQMaps.com, only it would also show the maps they don't have (they
show the zone exists, but that's it).
    Also at the same time, maybe a history chapter that contains history as
well as just general, maybe geographical type of info for each zone.
    Then along with this, include a history chapter about the history of EQ,
the gods, their wars, stuff like that.
    Another section containing the starting stats for characters, maybe 2
lists, one grouped by race and showing a list of all stats for the available
classes, as well as another list of classes, and stats for the available
races (and how many points we can put into the stats as well).
    Then just for more fun, a nice artwork section.  Maybe a picture for
each zone (drawn more in a painting style rather than photo).  Also some
pictures of the various mobs and their names, maybe even what point they
were added.
    I think some of this extra info would be looked at more like the people
who buy a DVD mostly to see all of the extra info on it as well as the
movie.  Does such a book exist?  If not then someone should make one with
these things in it. (Oh, some character art, maybe a full page picture of
each class holding the epic for that class, as well as other character art).
