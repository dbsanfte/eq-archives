/whot is short for /whotarget

If it comes back [Anonymous] you can at least do the /con command on them.
If they con green, they're at least a few levels below you.  If they con
blue they're around your level but below you.  If they con black/white
(depending on your window view) they're your level.  If they con yellow
they're around your level but above you.  If they con red they can be
anywhere from 2 levels to 59 levels above you, depending on your level.
