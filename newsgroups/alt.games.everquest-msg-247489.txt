Farmers are the biggest *sellers*. They don't go hand in hand. A power
gamer offloads some stuff he gets as he plays.. a farmer farms stuff
to sell.

The issue i have with SoE entering the fray is simple... in their
quest to get in on the action they will destroy the market for most
items and push the farmers out of business. That may seem like taking
the money off the table for SoE.. but what it ends up doing is losing
the subscription money of the farmers.

I don't mind if SoE wants to help the secondary markets. I do mind if
they try to take them over. If they want to be Yantis.. then i suggest
they follow Yantis and buy items from players for cash and resell for
profit. But they won't. If they in any way try insta-creating items
that normally take time and effort to farm.. it completely devalues
the item that they end up selling and fixes the max price to that
which Sony is selling it at. They've spent 5 years and millions of
dollars creating a subsistant world that can sustain user-generated
markets. They would be 10 shades of stupid if instead of supporting
those markets they tried to make them their own. They will only drive
the farmers out of business and subscriptions through the floor.

A real world analogy would be... lets say the United States had a huge
black box... where on the side you pressed a button and a car popped
out to your liking. After design.. manufacturing took milliseconds and
delivery the amount of time to transfer money to the US. While it
might be 'cool'... the main problem is that the economy is driven off
people who manufacture that car. Their wages in turn pay taxes. Their
wages in turn buy other goods which are manufactured. Without the
constant circulation of that money throughout that economy.. it grinds
to a halt. Now suggest doing it with any non no-drop items. People
simply will not pay SoE for goods that they cannot make money on. The
golden thread that runs through EQ and most economy-driven MMORPG's is
the feeling of the accumulation of wealth by the user. This needent
necessarily be game money or US money.. but friendships... items..
etc. And users will not continue to play a game where they do not
build wealth.. which is the suggestion of SoE.

If SoE is serious about helping the secondary markets.. I would say to
them the following:

1) make transfers of items for US cash offline legal while still
retaining ownership of items. They allready do it in game with pp..
validating the usage of cash for the transfer of items offline will
not change that. If you want to actually moderate the transfers.. then
support an in-game way of handling US cash. Casinos do it all the time
with the transfer of their chips to and from US cash, adapting it for
EQ use and to only transfer in-game platinum ala Yantis's methods and
not arbitrarily creating money wouldn't be hard. Price received and
given rises and falls via supply and demand and SoE charges a fee on
each transaction.

2) allow the transfer of accounts between different entities to occur.
This would work in a similar way to transferring the pink slip to your
car from one person to the other. Feel free to charge a fee to do so.

3) allow guest access to accounts. In doing so, you simply do not
allow a guest the ability to either destroy, transfer, or drop items.
This then allows friends to let their friends logon and try out the
game without having to purchase it.

4) You know you are going to do this.. do it. Put in a full featured
scripting engine, complete with looping and any other feature that
exists, to be able to control characters with. SoE allready realizes
the benefits of allowing boxing on systems.. now provide in-game
methods of adding much more control so that any user has the option.
So long as the items are still farmed using traditional methods and
the items are not auto-magically generated.. the economies will tend
to themselves.

But, whatever you do... do not under any circumstances introduce
auto-generated items or cash into the game economies. That idea is DOA
and will only end up wrecking the economy and those who benefit from
it. And if people can't feel like they're generating wealth over
time.. they will not play your game.

The idealists are really just a blip.. the pushing of farmers out of
business can AND will destroy you and your game.

That's what i'd say to them.
