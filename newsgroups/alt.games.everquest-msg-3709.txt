I'm happy you're getting a kick out saying the new word you
learned on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, but that doesn't mean it's
applicable.

If EVERYTHING in Everquest was slow enough to make reading a book
a good idea to pass the time, then you might have a point.

But you don't, because there are lots of times when a slow camp is
a nice relaxing change of pace from constant edge-of-your-seat
kill-kill-kill-maybe-die-kill-kill, and there are many times when
you need to do a lot of RL stuff anyway (clean house, etc.) but
can spare a few minutes every spawn cycle to see if you've hit
the jackpot.  

I myself camped the Fishbone Earring for about 50 hours (Hadden
is a 5.5 hour spawn, and only rarely drops the Earring), but I chose 
my time well, and did it when I was doing a big deadline crunch at 
home on my laptop anyway for a couple of days and couldn't possibly 
spare time for "regular" EQ adventuring anyway.  Leaning over to the
other computer every once in a while to answer "is Hadden 
camped?" /ooc's, and making sure I was on the EQ computer when Hadden 
was due to pop, barely impacted my work, but provided a much-needed 
work break every once in a while.  Not only did I get my work done, 
but I ALSO got the Fishbone Earring (woo hoo!).

If that's "pathetic" in your book, you have a lot to learn.  In
fact, I would submit that there are many things far more "pathetic"
than pursuing a slow but rewarding activity in Everquest -- for
example, spewing insults at people who dare to do things in
Everquest differently than you do.
