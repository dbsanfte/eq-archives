So, assuming for the sake of this that I am a Cox subscriber and want to
read the newsgroup, as I am sure there are at least *some* people out there
who fall into that category, you don't think you're eroding my freedom?

You eliminate my freedom to read the newsgroup.  You eliminate my freedom to
post to the newsgroup.  Government is not the sole grantor of freedoms.

Yeah, I guess erode was too light of a connotation.
