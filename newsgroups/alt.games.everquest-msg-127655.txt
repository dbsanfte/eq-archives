You need no drop hairs from Cobalt Scar sirens, not the droppable hairs
from Siren's Grotto ones.  Offhand I can't recall if the CS ones are
called "Loch of Siren Hair" or not, but the fact is that you can't buy the
ones you need off anyone no matter what they are called.

Loch, by the way, is scottish for lake, while I'm pretty sure the correct
word for a small bunch of hair is a Lock.
