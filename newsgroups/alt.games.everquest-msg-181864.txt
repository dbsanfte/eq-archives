You clearly don't.

The exp in /raid got MASSIVELY increased from what it was when /raid went
live (fucking apalling)

A 1 day clearing of vexthal (from the goo to AHR), numbers dropping and
rising from 40 to 60 throughout, average of 7 hours for the raid, used to
result in MAYBE 2% AA.

That same raid now results in 30-40% AA exp.   Its still quite shitty, but
its a massive improvement, and better than nothing.
