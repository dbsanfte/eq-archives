Well an exp camp for level 60's would be something doable with 2ish groups
of 50-60 people (imo) (usually)

Do you kill him comfortably?  VS isnt a really contested mob anymore (tho he
does drop cuz greedy mb wizzies!)   he drops "kunark armour" legs.. e.g
donals legs (cleric) jb (shaman) cobalt (warriors)

Our best kill on trak was a flawless, 18 person kill, no shaman (therefor no
uber resist buffs). that was back in the days that we were learning Dain,
just getting to the stage to kill vindi (usually)

Well thats 4 60's, and the key 60's too (cleric-aego/cel elix, shaman for
slowing).  A 56 rogue or a 60 rogue wouldn't really be the difference in
winning/losing the fight

Level 60 frog enchanter.  Hits for about half of what prot does (random
guess)

55 or above

She casts a cold ae slow (600? damage). She casts ae fear, she casts cheal.

hes a wimp for a kunark dragon, but he still has ae fear, and <60 players
will still be getting feared often.  I don't know how to compare dragon
fights for somebody that hasn't fought them..  there isnt really anything
else thats similar.

Well cash comes by strokes of luck really, not by going out and grafting.
If you hunt in sebilis and win a fungi random, you just won yourself 60k.
