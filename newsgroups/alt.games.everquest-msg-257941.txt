Damn, half the fun of grouping is that adrenaline rush you get 
when you survive a bad pull by the skin on your teeth! I want a 
little excitement, otherwise I could get one of those little 
drinking birdies to hit my heal key for me and watch princess bride.

I dont know about anybody else, but there is great fun in a risky 
pull - switching targets to heal, send pet, pull agro off a 
robewearer, tank a little, more spells....is sort of like playing 
a piano, and a great rush if it all works out in the end=)
