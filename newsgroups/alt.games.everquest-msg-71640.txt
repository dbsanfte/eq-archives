I believe you have a problem in line 25340 LET attack-damage = RND(10 * INT)
should be 25340 LET attack-damage = RND(10 * STR)

Your use of goto statements is also an indication of sloppy programming.
Remember to remark your work thoroughly. I also expect a fully detailed flow
chart turned in with all code.
