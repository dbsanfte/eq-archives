 Ok, how about this...The cleric spells of healing have been repalced with a
1 point DD spell that will immediatly put you on top of a mob's agro list.
Pissed off yet? VI has already done enough to piss off the upper level
people ,thank you very much.

And yes, the higher level characters ARE more "important", if you have
bothered to look around you in game you will notice that the population of
level 50+ players accounts for about 80% of server populations, and most of
us have multiple chars in the 50+ range. So you see WE are paying verant the
majority of their money, and pissing off the "longterm customers" is not a
wise thing to do.


And their "trivial loot code" is a piece of crap, Think about if it were
implemented from the start of EQ...that nice little glowing black stone that
drops off of a level 15 necro??? Nope, sorry  trivial loot, the platnium
ring for the paw quest? By the time people get to do the quest the mummy is
very green to them. The fishbone earring?  Yeah right. The list goes on and
on.

Trivial loot code is a load of steaming shit. And yes the low-mid level
dungeons ARE the business of high level chars,  its called game content that
we have paid for. All places in the game are the "business" of everyone, it
is part of the product you bought and continue to pay for.
