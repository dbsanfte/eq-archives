While the rest of your post is saddening, and doesnt sound good, this bit
is funny to a non US citizen ;)

Its quite common to have no off street parking here in the UK. Hell, I'm
pretty well off, employed, in a nice 3 bedroom appartment, DO have a 
car parking space.... and dont have a car.

Never even bothered learning to drive.

Is it that public transport sucks the US over, or just the culuture of
"must use own car to get around"? Whenever I've been in manhatten the
subways been kinda manky and nasty, but at least works and relatively
cheap, but all my american friends wrinkle their noses when I say things
like "get the bus" or "use the train".

Its like theres a class distinction. You only use public transport if you're
too po' to sit in a traffic jam all day ;)
