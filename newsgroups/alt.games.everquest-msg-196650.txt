At level 58, canning becomes much more effective, maybe earlier now with 
the mini torpor.  With the gimp CH and Canni IV, I can go from oom, low 
health to 95% mana and health in about 2 minutes.  I don't have torpor yet, 
so I can't speak from experience with regards to how it does for this 
purpose, although I do understand it is quite effective.
