Yes, i took a 1.5 month break from EQ after playing WAAAYYY too much of it
for a year. I was running a company with my sister. Me programming and my
sister doing the paper stuff i have no clue about.
I played all the time. Went to office and often ran EQ on another machine
and was playing while code compiles or test programs ran. When i got home i
sat down and played till i started feeling the cofeine and sleep depravation
induced illness. When i woke up i fired up EQ and killed some stuff while
sipping the morning coffee and watching "morning" news on TV (actually i
usually didn't wake up before 2pm or so :/).
However i just relocated IRL myself and started on another server because a)
some of my RL friends started playing on that server and b) theres lots of
other Finnish folks on that server.
I was forced to go without EQ for about 1.5 months because i coulnd't get
internet connection any faster in my new appartment.
I again started reading, hang out in coffee shops, do shopping and cooking.
Now that i have started playing again, i'm not nearly as obsessive at it as
i used to be. Still i log in almost every night but i mostly just kill a
critter every now and then while doing other stuff.
At weekends i might take a whole day to play. (Planning to play whole sunday
now)
Anyway. EQ seems to be much more fun now actually. I dont anymore rip my
hair out if i happen to die, and i am nicer to people there.
Downside is that i dont know any people outside my guild, and cant group
because groups tend to take so much time and people get upset if the
enchanter just "visits" in a group just for an hour or so.

Anyway. Have fun in the Real World for a change :)


...Now... We need alt.everqrackers.anonymous (Hey there's
alt.mudders.anonymous already :))
If you stop to think for a while, you notice that an "average" everquest
player is actually pretty much acting like a narcotics addict. :/ And i'm
serious.
