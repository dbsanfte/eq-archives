Odd.  I've seen ogres and trolls and such get wedged in tight tunnels way too
often to call it an advantage.  And the expense of having to blow a couple
hundred pp on shrink potions every time you want to raid somewhere...  unless
you shell out the 40 k plus for a cobalt bracer.

Plus, the world just looks so much less impressive when you're looking down at
this puny bear, rather than up at the huge gaping jaws of of a bear
instead.... (Recently started a Barbarian Beastlord.  Not liking it too much)

You could also try to get a swirlspine belt from the guardians around Phinny.
Theres usually no shortage of people needing to raid him for epic items, so
it's not too hard to convince people to go.   Low haste value on the item too,
so the others in the group likely have better.  (one strong group, or two
weaker ones) A big plus is that it's droppable.

You could also try for the Sash of the Dragonborn from Charsis (Howling
Stones), but that has more haste than a FBSS, and armor class to boot, so if
your guild is anything like mine, it would almost certainly end up going to
one of the higher level primaries as an upgrade, rather than your low level
twink.
