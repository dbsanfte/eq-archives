My bard and my ranger partner recently duo'd "goz" as it's known on
our server... the area near the zone out.

We are both 65 (and only about 10 AA), but found no difficulty with
the mobs there.  Most were light blue or green to us, and we were
resisting nearly every nuke they tried to land.  There were several
factors working for us there: our level, our equipment is getting
better having received no drop armor from Ssraezha temple, ToV and
other places, plus we had Psalm of Veeshan playing as one of the songs
in my twist.  I'd highly recommend playing fire/cold resist there as
that's where most of the damage will come from.  The warriors are
kinda wimpy.  I think our health rarely dropped below 80%.

For fun, I was charming the wizards and sicking them on the warriors
or shaman.    It was fun to have the wizards flipping around, casting
nukes on our targets.

We only stayed for an hour or so, as the loot was not that good.  But
I've heard that named spawn there and that they drop decent, saleable
stuff.  No nameds spawned while we were there, though, so they may be
semi-rare.


There are two frogs near the inzone that are similar to the frogs near
goz.  Experiment with those a few times... I'd suggest charm pulling
the two.  You should do fine there.
