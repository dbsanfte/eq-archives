When I started Tiru, I knew I wanted to be a dwarf. However, the old
female dwarf models look like crap in my opinion. Yes, they are pretty.
But they don't look like DWARVES. So I started a male dwarf, who will
spend a lot of in character time bitching about the modern fashion that
encourages the ladies to shave. I do like the new dwarf female models,
but don't really like the new male models. Although I am grumbling that
the ladies cannot alter their beard color or adjust them with the same
variety as the males.

I did petition and request a sex change for cosmetic reasons. In
petitions answered by guides, I was refused immediately. So I emailed
the GM, explained what I wanted and why, and received the answer "This
is an in game issue- please speak to me in game." SO I petitioned asking
to speak to GM in reference to my email, and managed to get past the
guide. Got the alternate GM Ariehlle (our server tends to have two). She
turned me down flat, and indicated that she has seniority over GM
Silius. Petitioned again when she was offline and Silius was on. Then he
turned me down too.

At this point, I am resolved to take comfort in my masculinity and
continue flirting with all the pretty ladies who can stand it. He's my
only male, and will stay that way.
