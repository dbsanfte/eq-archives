Someone found this on the official message boards, through some
digging, kind of funny they don't mention this rather important tidbit
on the Legends "accentuate the positive" site:

http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp?id=39fa8956-19b9-11d6-96ce-080020e8ab81&resource=&number=2&isExternal=0

"Here is the solution:  EverQuest: If I discontinue my EverQuest
Legends service will there be a fee to move back to my original
server(s)? 

You will be moved back to your original server at no extra charge.
Your characters will be moved back fully equipped minus the EverQuest
Legends server specific items."


So I guess some uber guild people figuring they'll go over for some
phat lewt then switch to regular will get a surprise.. 


http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp

and do a search for legends.


This makes it seem a bit more creepy, once you are paying the $29
bucks more on the legends server and get a few unique things which you
like you'll want to keep paying that and stay there so you don't lose
them.. forever... one of us.. one of us... one of us...
