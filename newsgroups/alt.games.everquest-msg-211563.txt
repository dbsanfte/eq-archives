What if one'choice of sexual orifice includes the orifices of
underage boys and girls, or orifices of dead bodies, or orifices
of farm animals, or orifices of your little sister?

I'm afraid that ones choice of places that are fine to put
your peepee into has a lot to do with morality.  I am not
gay. I am married.  I could probably name about 3 billion
women on this planet that I would love to investigate the
multiple orifices of, but I chose to only involve myself with
the orifices of one certain female because that's what my
morality (and that of my parents/church/society) tells me
marriage is.  Some guys make it a point to keep as many
different orifices available for use on many different
females reguardless of marital status.  Those same people
would probably frown on prison rape and on a priest playing
"tug the church bell rope" with some little boys.

Some guys' morality tells them its ok to wear assless pants
and hang out in parks waiting to circle jerk with George
Michael and Boy George.  They leave me alone (out of shape
guys with a buzz-cut don't register on gaydar), but it is
difficult to try to explain to a four year-old child why
those two men are "wrestling" in the public bathroom on
I-40.

If gay members of a guild want to come out and champion
the cause of gay rights, that's fine.   Why is it not
fine that somebody can disagree with their lifestyle?
Granted most of the time the fella wouldn't enter into
a guildchat with "b0i i like sukkin dix," so I can under-
stand somebody being upset with an admission of homosexuality
being met with "dam whatta F.A.G!!!!11!!!1!LOLOLOLOLOLKEKEKE"
What I have seen (on 3 separate occasions on 2 servers) is:

Pinkranger tells the guild "I'm gay"

Bigtank tells the guild "Damn, it sucks to be you"

Pinkranger tells the guild "DON'T BLAST ME WITH YOUR
OUTDATED SOCIAL MORES AND YOUR JUDGEMENTAL JUDEO-XTIAN
BELIEFS I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO ANYTHING WITH ANOTHER ADULT
THAT I WANT AND YOU'RE A MORON THAT BELIEVES IN ABSOLUTES
AND PROBABLY CREATIONISM AND YOU'RE PROBABLY A 14 YEAR OLD
THAT THINKS HE MIGHT BE GAY AND ONLY LASHES OUT TO HIDE HIS
HOMOSEXUAL FEELINGS AND I HOPE YOU GET AIDS FROM ONE OF YOUR
RELIGIOUSLY REFORMED LESBIAN WIVES"

Nodden tells the guild "Yeah, stick it to those xtians, PR"

Gunswithoutammo tells the guild "Yeah, BT, I'm a wiccan do
you want to burn me at the stake, too?"

Bigtank tells the guild "..."

I've followed most of this thread (just because the same
one pops up every 4 or 5 months since April of '99), just
because it always seems to me that folks in a minority
opinion (in the US anyways) seem to have been told somewhere
that (a) having the exact same opinion as themselves means
a person is tolerant and intelligent, and (b) not only are
those that disagree with them  bigoted inbreds with a tooth
to share around the family, but that they probably shouldn't
be allowed to voice those opinions at all.

Oh, well, maybe we can all hope and pray for the day that
everybody realizes that EVERYONE is gay at heart and the
human population dies off because hetersexuals are too
afraid to go out in public to find others like themselves...
