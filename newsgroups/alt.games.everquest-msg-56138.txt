I'm a bard.

It's always amusing when...

  - Casters say "Play the mana song, nothing else."
    (Do they not understand all the things a bard can do for a
     group OTHER than provide mana?)

  - Members of your group fear mobs and get mad when you move out
    of song range to kill the mobs running away (Don't FREAKIN' fear
    when you've got a full group!)

  - Chanters cast clarity on bards

  - Druids cast SOW on bards

Sorry, ranting.
