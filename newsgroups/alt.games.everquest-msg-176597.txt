Enjoyment - pure and simple....you are harping on about going to DnD -
take a lesson - make your own objectives. THe Vox is sitting her learn how
to go kill and X, the epic quests, cultural tradeskills are all no
different to a pregenned, DM run event...the difference in EQ is that the
tableau is there and you have to generate your own story....if you've done
everything then you have done everything - in the same vein when a DnD
campaign reaches a certain point you put it to bed and go play summat
else.

What do you mean longingly - I still play DnD we've got a 12 year old
campaign sitting about, 3rd Ed in the second year of play, Warhammer
Fantasy roleplay for a similar length of time, Wheel of Time on the run
plus the occasional trip out to some other system......EQ still gets
played.

> achievements.I wish EQ was as great as D&D.

Wishing EQ was as great as DnD is counterproductive....they give
difference experiences fo different times and with different people. I
dont really want to play in a fragmented world with 6 other players -
Diablo tried that and was a disaster. Nor does wishing EQ was as great as
DnD indicate that EQ has no value......this is a non sequitur to your
complaint.
