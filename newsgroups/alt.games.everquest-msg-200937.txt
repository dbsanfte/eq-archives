Sorry, but I'm skeptical.

Skeptical, that is, that you've talked to each of these people
individually to determine their age, grouped with them enough
to determine their level of desire for instant gratification,
and discussed with them their game preferences, and on top of
that, got their opinions on KEI.

Even if you did all that, your sample size can't possibly be
statistically useful.

Throwing in the word "tend" is a good save, but I still think
you painted a false picture with your sweeping generalization.

I could just as easily respond: the people who I know who like
KEI tend to be the over-30, mature, married with children,
hard working types that don't like instant gratification but
prefer to work hard and earn their rewards.

There.  We're back at square one.  As you can see, it's just
not a valid way to debate a topic.
