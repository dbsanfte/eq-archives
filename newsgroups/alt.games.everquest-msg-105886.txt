You are KOS in both places. However, massive slaughter in the Warrens will
make you loveable in Paineel. It will even allow you to walk near guards in
Erudin (but everyone else will still want your head onna stick).

With Luclin, you can always port up to the moon for shopping. Once I did the
Amulet of the Haven quest about four times, I was up to indifferent
throughout Shadowhaven. I tend to us it for about 75% of my shopping needs.
