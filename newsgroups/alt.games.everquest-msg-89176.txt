I think my skill in baking is somewhere near 30.  Can I tryt fish and
batwings and hope to make any fish rolls?

Will it fail all the time, and if so, will I at least advance my
skill?

(It seems like fish and batwings are relatively easy to get, and easy
to make... so I wouldn't mind failing every time, as long as the skill
goes up.)
