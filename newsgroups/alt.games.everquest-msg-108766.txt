Actually, one thing that I was not aware of until just recently...  the
permanent buff on the blue blade of the warrior epic, Rage of Tallon, is plus
about 10 or so to armor class, 40 to attack, and 40 to dexterity.

May be purely wishful thinking, but it seems to me that there were additional
bonuses to attacking from behind, and that normal swings hit harder as well.
Has anyone ever tested this?
