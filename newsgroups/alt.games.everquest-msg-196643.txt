At times I can be a superficial as the next person but in this case I was
just curious. I've seen a lot of people playing Frogloks and wanted to know
what the big deal was.

I still like Barbarians best. The only problem I've had with them is that
you can't fit in some places. I found that out when I couldn't go into any
of the buildings in the tree city in GF. All I wanted to do was trade in
some coins at the bank. That got put on hold!

That's what I figured. I was just wondering if some starting cities might
just be busier in general too. I know that Halas is incredible easy to
navigate and never seems over crowded.
