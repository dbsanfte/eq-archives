Happens to me, too.  All you can do is /bug it.  Hopefully they'll fix it,
but given the other myriad DX9 issues they're facing, I imagine this is at
the bottom of the list.

As an aside, I can use my mouse wheel to zoom out while in first-person mode
so that I'm actually trailing my character a little.  I use that sometimes
when using my drogmor, makes it less painful.
