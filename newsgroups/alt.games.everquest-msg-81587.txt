So goes the myth. I've seen L60 enchanter after L60 enchanter decide
its not worth bothering about anymore. They still keep it modestly
high but go more for hp and resists over cha. They have found it
common to charm for long periods of time with no cha on at all and
found it common for charms to break early with 200 cha.

Its one of those things that has gone around as gospel, but when it
came to people actually going out and testing it, cha was found
wanting. I know some still buy into the charisma myth, but more and
more its falling to the wayside.

So reiterated: MR and level difference is the prime consideration when
charming, charisma a VERY distant third consideration.
