LOL jazz

And Faned, I work too every single week day for 8 and half hours, killing
Doze has nothing to do with having "no life" as you so kindly put it.. some
people don't work, some people have college with breaks in the day, some
people work early, some people work late, some people are off work ill, some
people are retired, some people are from different countries/continents

Im sure your guild is made up of the same sort of individuals as mine and
every other guild

With FCFS, some you win and some you lose... if killing the mob really means
that much to you, then do whats required to get there first and kill it
