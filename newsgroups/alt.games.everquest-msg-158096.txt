The PoK ports all drop you safely away from guards. For example the FP
pedastal is located in the West Freeport tunnels (the ones leading to
the necro guilf) well away from guards and other NPCs. The Cab port
drops you in Field of Bone.

Lavastorm, South Ro, North/East/South Karana, Cobalt Scar, Wakening
Lands, Dreadlands, Emerald Jungle, Skyfire, Surefall, Planes of
Sky/Hate are all places unavailable from the PoK.
