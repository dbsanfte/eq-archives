No, he doesn't. He contends that IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS USED,
it has one origin. In fact, he outright says "pussy" has multiple
meanings. The "coward" meaning is derived from the "vagina" meaning of
the word. How is that saying the word has one meaning? It's saying
that one meaning is DERIVED FROM another.
