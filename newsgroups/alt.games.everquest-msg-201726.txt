I remember distinctly arguing with one of the other PC's that he should 
let me use the rope of climbing so I could swim out and up this tower, I 
was the only one with any swim skill... so I start talking about the 
rope in his hands, that rope right there, see that rope, the one we use 
to climb things, (Cast spell Command:) GIMME!  DM ruled no contest, and 
I bolted into the water that little halfling was scared to go into. 
Later, on the same tower, we ran into a bunch of guards and their 
captain way up on a walkway on the side of the tower.  I simply told the 
commander to DIVE into the water way down there and he obeyed.  The rest 
of the guards didn't want to mess with me and I still had another 
command memorized.  They don't let me play clerics anymore. :)
