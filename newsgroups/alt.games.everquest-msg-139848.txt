CRT prices are going down because of LCD's saturating the market. Although
the LCD has gotten much better it's not up to par with the CRT where gaming
is concerned. I'd say look for a good 20/21" CRT. Oh and on the eye strain
thing...as long as your monitor is capable of a refresh rate of 100Hz+ you
shouldn't have any problems. Most new ones can do 120-160Hz.
See my post earlier today titled, "Why use V-sync?..."
