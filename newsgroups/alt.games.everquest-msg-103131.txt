I was definately puzzled as all hell when he just got up and run back to his
group (and I expect his group was too) - I was fully expecting him to
re-feign again immediately and then have to wait out the mobs dispersal with
him laying on top of me.

There was no sane reason I could see for him returning as the Ry'Gorr's tore
his entire group to shreds in a matter of seconds. The only thing I could
think of is they were all caught OOM and unaware at the same time and he
presumed they were FM and on alert? I didn't get a chance to see how much
life he had though - but even if he was low, panic seems odd for a post-40's
character.

Anyway - all's well that ends well : )
