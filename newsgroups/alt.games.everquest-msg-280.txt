 Uh... well.. I wasn't "raised out of mommy's pocket" whatever that means
but I instead dragged myself to class everyday for 5 years and learned how
to do something well so I could afford to spend $100 every two or three 
years for decent equipment that does nice things. Pretty much anybody can 
do that these days (unless you happen to live in a third world nation, in 
which case you wouldn't even be here OR playing EQ) if they have the initiative
and drive to do it.

 Why didn't you?
