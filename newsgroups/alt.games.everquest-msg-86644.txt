Touchy issue I really don't care for in EQ. LOTS of players and too
few camps. Have to share many times. A little common courtesy on his
part wouldn't have been too much to ask though.

One of those people that is just so completely unreasonable and out of
touch that they're not worth any attention whatsoever. /IGNORE them
and move on.

My philosophy is simple. You are responsible for your own actions. If
you get in a bind and ask and someone is willing to help you out,
great. However, don't expect it from people, because you/I are/am not
the responsibility of others. I wouldn't worry too much about a
tarnished rep., because the only people you will wind up tarnishing it
with will be the ones you would really rather not have any dealings
with anyway.
