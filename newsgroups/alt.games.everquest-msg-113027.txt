Rogues can if they've got good position and are good at avoiding aggro. 
Monks can go full offensive and drop aggro (usually) instantaneously. 
Usually resulting in the death of a rogue who isn't as good at avoiding
aggro.  :)  Most monks will put out a better damage-per-day average.

Rangers can't.  Simply put, they can't.  Sure, they can get a lucky fight
here and there, use a disc that turns a mob into a pincushion, etc., but
day-to-day a ranger will fall squarely behind a monk in damage output.
