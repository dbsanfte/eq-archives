My onboard SB PCI 128 works better for EQ than my Audigy Gamer sitting in a
PCI slot.  I think it's more a function of your video/audio chipset
(sometimes motherboard manufacturers will throw crappy ones on there to keep
costs down) than it is where it physically resides in your computer.  Only
basic difference is that you can't actually see the PCI/AGP slot used for
your onboard stuff, and it saves a bit of silicon.  As far as software is
concerned, the two are identical.
