Sorry to tell you, they aren't worth a lot. If you already have a mule there,
go for it. Lots of times, the lowbies get to the bazaar and look for low cost
items they can use so if you want to sell the stuff, by all means, have at it.
I do a price check to see what the item is selling for and then price it in the
median area as I don't feel comfortable doing the throat cutting thing. Used to
be, you checked the price at a merchant that didnt like you a whole lot, then
multiply by 3 or 5 iirc. Now, with the economy in Norrath as it is, who knows.
By selling it, you are doing a valued service to genuine lowbies who have
little or no plat. Good luck friend. =)
