I have a ranger just turned 51. Up to 51 I was soloing, (EW, DSP, then
Jaggedpine Forest on the griffons) getting about 1% exp per kill, meaning
approximately 100-110 kills pers level. They drop good cash too, and
sometimes other loot. but after I dinged 51 it took me 15 kills to reach 10%
so I am guessing the grind really begins now.

Having spent the last few months grinding solo I'm now bored with it. At the
times I play getting a group is hit and miss, (spent half an hour in KC
reading the newspaper while LFGing) before I gave up. I would like to do
something else for a while, in-game, such as questing and sight seeing.
With SoW, Greater Camo, I feel safe to explore most places, so I would like
to take a look around, go where I have not been yet.

I started in Greater Faydark, moved to Crushbone, Paludal Caves, Everfrost
Peaks, Overthere, Dreadlands, briefly, then Eastern Wastes, Dawnshrowd
Peaks, and finally Jagged Pine.

So can anyone suggest some good quests to do: solo, at 51, by a ranger.
Quests that were fun for you to do as well as rewarding. By fun I mean not
having long timesinks runs, or camps on a particular MoB, whilst you read a
book and glance at the screen once in a while.

Also, are there any great places to visit, just for how they look, for
sightseeing value, and are there any so-called secret areas, which you would
not stumble on without knowing they are there? Yes, I coud look at the maps
on eqatlas, and plot out a route, or just go to each zone one after another,
til I've seen them all, but any suggestions before doing that would be
helpul.
