Well, I think that classifying it to FoH's primary casters (and their
ilk) is excessive. And it's certainly more than a couple dozen. I
suppose it's just a matter of degrees. The day may come (and after PoP
undoubtedly *will*) when a lot of the items in question will become
somewhat higher priced bazaar trash, and then a lot of folks would have
been banging up against the now defunct cap. But for the time being, I'd
still put it at less than 1% of the total Norrathian population. Still a
fairly exclusive club, no?

Well, you're decribing a guild that is probably (barring disaster) not
that much ahead of us. Maybe three to six months. The huge difference is
that they are level 60 oriented, where as we are just trying to grow our
own level sixties. (Now we have a whopping three. Wheeeeeeeee!) But we
have nearly a dozen past 57 so we're getting there. They're also a few
mobs ahead of us, as we wiped out to Vindi in a bloody horrific botched
attempt. But hey.... we're trying. :-)

But that is a key difference, isn't it? Being sixty and having a solid
set of archtype AA skills can be a HUGE leg up for the stuff we're
talking about, IMO, even if your gear is somewhat "modest" for the
average sixty in a raiding guild. But yes, I'll grant you, those folks
you describe could easily get most of that gear. On our server, off the
top of my head, I can think of four small to mid sized guilds that fall
into that category. (I tend to think of them as the "tier three" guilds,
with us having a single tier one guild, and two or three more that are
chasing them, not far behind, in Tier 2.

Granted completely.

You've totally and completely underestimated my capacity for screwing up
and missing out on gear opportunities. ;-)

I completely agree, and never once have I said I didn't want it removed.
I simply maintained that it's not as much of an issue as a lot of the
whining and gnashing of teeth we've heard made it out to be. It was a
cap that would possibly affect 1% of the player base. And even if they
hit it, until PoP how much further could they go? Another hundred +Mana?
If you're well up in the over 4.5K mana pool range, what's another
hundred mana really going to get you in *any* situation? Bah. I'd rather
invest the slot upgrade in more HP or something at that point anyway. An
extra 450 damage on a manaburn or and extra level 41 spell isn't likely
worth the tribulations I'd probably have to face to get it. Particularly
when there's so much more all/all HP stuff that we can compete with the
warriors for.
