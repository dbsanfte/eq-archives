From level 1-12, my general experience,

Fighter - 1-6 easy, 7-12 tougher until I got the Rune-like ability on my
Crusader (absorbs damage, no component, long recast, but not so long you
can't use it multiple times in the same fight).

Mage - 1-12 tough.

Priest - 1-12 much easier than mage, easier most times than Fighter.  Can
take on multiple mobs easier due to self-heals during combat, but can't
last as well as a Fighter if you run out of power.

Scout - no idea never tried.
