Hello,

I recently purchased the Scars of Velious expansion and I believe that I am
having some problems with it.  Other night I made my first trips into
Velious and was hunting in the Eastern Wastes zone.  All the mobs that I
encountered in the zone were displayed as unequipped bald humans (except for
wolves - they appeared okay).  All mobs that I saw looked alike, Snow
Bunnies, Orcs, Manticores, and giants - giants just appeared as taller
humans.  At first I just thought it was a bit of Verant humor thrown in the
game - a snow bunny that looks like Telly Savalas, but as it went on I
thought something wasn't right.

I did some investigations and testing and so far I think my install of SoV
isn't correct and the issue is specially directed at the patcher.

1)  When I first installed SoV, and re-logged back into the game, there
weren't any new files that were downloaded by the patcher for the SoV
expansion.  I thought this was odd at the time especially seeing the game
has been out for a while - I would have thought that there would have been a
few files fixed since then. But didn't put much other thought into it.

2)  After the issues I saw in the Eastern Wastes, I poked around the patcher
(version 1.0.19).  I went into the Advanced options.  I would have thought
that I should see a listing and check box for Scars of Velious, but I don't.
I do see the Kunark expansion and Luclin expansion listed.  These are both
checked and I have been receiving file updates for both those expansions.
There actually looks like there is enough space in the window for a Velious
line to be there.  But it does not appear.  This would lead me to believe
that the patcher doesn't understand that I have SoV.

3)  While in the Advanced options I checked do a Complete File check.  The
scan did not report anything as incorrect.

4)  After exiting the patcher, I then went into the Program Files\Everquest
directory and dragged the three .s3d files for Eastern Wastes (dated
11/16/2001) off to the desktop.  I did not delete them in fear that I might
not be able to get them back and then I'd be really stuck.  I went back into
the patcher and ran it as normal and as a complete check - neither made any
improvements.

I have registered the SoV expansion.  At the server selection screen, I am
given the Expansion Enabled display.  And there is no Register expansion
button any more.  This matches the SoV manual saying that the expansions are
correctly registered (page 3 of SoV manual that came with CD).

I am curious if anyone else has seen or reported this problem, and if there
is a solution to it.  The zones appear to be playable though a bit screwed
up.  I'm wondering though if I am missing content or fixes that have been
made to SoV which could affect game play.

Thanks in advance...
