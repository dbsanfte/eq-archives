Normally Im in control of the situation enough, to make sure what I say
isn't a clear and direct threat... theres been odd occasions where I've
totally lost it, and probably sent tells which are pretty incriminating, but
its not often...

/tell ksing_prick, "It would really suck if my pull goes wrong and you get
some extra mobs..."

/tell ksing_prick, "Your lucky I don't train ksing punks like you" (followed
by a train.. hehe)

/tell ksing_prick, "I Wonder what would happen if the entire castle was
trained on somebody?  Gee that would be brutal... it would be a bad idea to
piss a monk off, don't you think?!"

Well not being able to prove i DIDNT do it, hardly counts as a conviction I
think... but at the same time, my account is clear, my rep is good etc..
