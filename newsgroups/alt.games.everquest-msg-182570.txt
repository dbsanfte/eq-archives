All the other Pet classes get a new Uber pet buff, but not Necro's or there
ofspring the Shadow Knights ( who could realy use it for there under powered
pets.)


Class             Spell                               Effect on Pet
Effect on caster

Beastloard    Bond of Wind                60% haste                    +150

                                                              +25 Strength
+150 Points of Healing

Magician    Elemental Empathy        60% haste                      +280 to

                                                            +20 AC
+30 Magic Resistance

OK so maybe it isn't all the other pet classes.

As a shadow knight I was realy happy seeing that the first couple of pet
classes get  GOOD pet buffs, then I get to the shadow knight.
A dot that does almost the same amount of damadge as the Heat blood / heart
flutter combo, with out the strength and AC debuff.  Now if it stacks with
those two it is a great spell, but this is SOE we are talking about.
Knowing them it wont stack with either of them.
Then the other Great new spell  Feign Death 1.7.1.  Lets see. Cost 20 more
mana, Takes the same amount of time to cast, but they cut 7 seconds off the
recast.  (80 mana, 1.5 Sec Casting time, 8 sec. recast time).

IT would have been nice to get a pet buff for the 40's since we get one at
29 ( 20 % haste, 5 STR, 2 AC), and one at 64 (65 % haste, 55 STR, 15 AC).
Not to mention that our pets can only take about 1/5th to 1/10th the
pounding that we can before it goes poff.  Cant remember how many Skellys
desintigrated at the hands of a mob that had been green for 10 lvl's..

Well that's it for my rant. It's way late here.

Omiin.

PS I want the Mage's bet spell.   You here me there Sony???
