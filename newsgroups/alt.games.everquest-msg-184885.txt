Does Lenny know you imagine his death? :)

Funnily enough, my mom and I were just talking about me placing an ad 
tonight.  It came around after I discussed how the one problem I had 
with staying single was that I already hated work, and 40 more years of 
it wasn't looking attractive - and that sometimes marrying a guy for his 
salary (and no, Annie, I'm not intimating you or any other wives do, I'm 
just evil ;p) didn't seem so bad an idea.  So we made up my personal ad:

"Young overweight female seeks wallet.  Does not have to be firmly 
attached to husband.  Wallet and attachment must like cats, doing 
dishes, cleaning, working for a living, and must laugh at all my jokes.  
No children.  Bring own computer and supply of books, please."

I'm thinking this'll get me plenty of replies.  Like "you're a 
loony!" :)

I dunno - not playing EQ at the *top* of her list for finding a new 
husband isn't a good sign.  If it was a convenient bonus in her new 
husband, then sure.  But this - I'd almost suspect that she got into an 
affair with this guy online and simply used EQ as an excuse to leave.
