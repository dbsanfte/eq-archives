Other good reasons have been mentioned, and mine are similar, plus
others:

First, the social interaction part of the game goes up tenfold if you
get into a good guild with people who you can easily make friends with.
Lots of nice folks to chat with in guild chat.

Instant information resources... when wondering about the right price
for things you are considering buying or selling, when needing to know
where a particular quest item or NPC is, directions to something in a
new zone.. if you are in a large guild with some experienced players,
you can often find out this stuff without worrying about somebody
jerking you around with a simple /guild message.

Grouping/Raiding options: This one can be the hardest to deal with. But
if you are in a guild with lots of people in your level range, a guild
can seriously expand your hunting grouping options. Many zones are BYOG,
and pickup group people without guild support simply don't go there for
that reason. A guild can set up hunting groups or raid parties and go
pretty much anywhere they wish that's level appropriate.
  The hard bit there is when you either fall behind most of the others
in level, or (as in my case) outlevel them so there's nobody left that
can survive in the zones you want to move up to. This is the one reason
that's driving me to leave my current, longstanding guild, and move into
something a "bit more uber". Sad, but a requirement. It can be fun to go
help a bunch of lower level guildies to raid Paw, but if that's all you
do and there's nobody to go to Skyfire or Seb or Velks with you, you're
not going to do very well.

But all in all, I'd rather be guilded than not unless I'm playing a
character that I have for strictly soloing fun. (/wave Uxivar the baby
necro.)
