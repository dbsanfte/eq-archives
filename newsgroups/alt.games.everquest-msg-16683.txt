All sarcasm aside, I'm no great defender of VI in some activities, but
they do a pretty good job in some cases for customer service issues. you
should exhaust all channels of asking them to give you a break before
bailing entirely. Beyond that, you seriously can't be blaming them for
your inability to keep track of your personal affairs. I work behind the
firewall of a massive corporate intranet where things like "forgetting
your security information" can get you a warning or even fired IRL. It's
a game. If 30 bucks is a serious burden for you, remember that the game
itself will run you that much every 3 months or so, plus (depending on
your system specs) periodic upgrades to keep up with the technology.
When 30 bucks is a serious issue to you, you might want to consider a
different recreational activiity like reading, which can be done for
free with a library card in most burgs. Even cable television is cheap
compared to EQ, though not as interactive.
