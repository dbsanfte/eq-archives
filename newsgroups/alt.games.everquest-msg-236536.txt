A limited framework for multiplayer play.  Starcraft provided no means to 
play TCP/IP games other than Blizzard's service, which was, at least for a 
time, frequently down due to one reason or another.  And for those at LAN 
parties who wish to play multiplayer, it might not even be *possible* to 
play via Battle.net.

What the hell has "information wants to be free" fanaticism have to do 
with a server emulator?  Blizzard's customers found bnetd to be useful.  
Bnetd violated no laws.  Blizzard saw fit to shut it down under bogus 
legal threats (Yes, bogus.  Blizzard first threatened a DMCA suit, and 
then dropped that ridiculous part of their claim when the EFF stepped up 
to defend), despite these facts.

Contempt.
