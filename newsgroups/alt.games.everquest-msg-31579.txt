Usually, the reminder that harm can come, is more effective than
actually doing harm.

Im really a nice, good guy, and I don't DoS systems.. but a static IP in

is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
