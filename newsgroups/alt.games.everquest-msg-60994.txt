Hmm, I see a problem with this explaination.  Looking closer, at
http://www.internettrafficreport.com/cgi-bin/tr_chartpage.pl?24.49.56.94
which is the site for the specific router that is doing poorly in PA, I see
that the thing has been flatlined for at least 24 hours.  I had a perfectly
good connection yesterday, up to as recently as 1am my time, so there's
no difference between when I was able to log on, and now when I am
not, based on what I see there.

Any other ideas?
