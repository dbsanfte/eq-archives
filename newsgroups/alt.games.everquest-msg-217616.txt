It's called getting customers that won't play EQ/DAoC/SWG/AC/AC2/Whatever
because the one 'key feature' that those games don't have exists in this
game, and is implemented the way people will enjoy it.

Play or run economy. Er Player Run Economy. The 'Hardcore' tradeskillers
want it. They want to never lift a sword/gun.  AC2 and SWG have tried it.
SWG seems to be the more successful, but time will tell. DAoC had a version
of it, and it wasn't bad. DAoC has many other problems but at least their
economy isn't completely busted.

Making you go to someone for all your toys is not forcing you to be a
tradeskiller. It's forcing you to interact with others if you want decent
gear. Granted that's still forced gaming style, but at least it makes more
sense in a massivly 'multiplayer' game. I do understand your argument
though.

Not neccessarily correct. There are two ways to survive. Go 'one on one with
the great one' (EQ) or get a niche. Niche is perhaps easier to get, as AC,
DAoC, and to a lesser extent SWG are all going One on One. Shadowbane,
despite what the fanboi's said, was really an attempt at getting the niche
(unrestricted pvp), but failed mainly because a) the niche players you were
looking for are the least loyal and most troublesome bunch <bold>in
general</bold> and b) it just took too long to get to market, and was
substandard compared to the competition.

True dat.
Which is why EQ will live a while longer. To paraphrase a love song by Wierd
Al, It's not perfect, but it's good enough for now.
