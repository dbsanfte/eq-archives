Really mystifies me.

Perhaps, if you haven't, you should delete the old shortcut and create
new ones. Since the D&S directory seems to be what is being accessed,
the only way to sever that with the old? shortcut would be to delete
and recreate (or edit the incorrect reference whatever it is).

I am wondering if the path specified in the shortcut for the execute
program points to the D&S directory. Even if it starts in the right
game directory (i.e. target directory), if the shortcut points to the
execute files in the D&S one, then the execute would do whatever it
does in the D&S directory since (again AFAIK) there is no INI or
equivalent to point it different.

As for how all this came about... how long was your break and did you
do anything like archive the EQ directory? I am not that up on what can
happen if you were to copy and happen to drop it on a shortcut
(probably nothing but I don't wanna try it just now to find out). That
would seem to be a possible (not necessarily likely) way for it to
happen, especially if you happen to do a MOVE rather than a COPY. Hmmm,
is the D&S copy mostly complete with some or all of the subdirectories
that would be in the regular EQ directory?

Hope you figure this out. Maybe it was the gremlins... :)
