I think that this is true - having only ben here on one occasion and had 4
group wipes that day (I FD'd... what can I say)
Nobody in my regular group wants to go here anymore, because of the usual
IDIOTS (You know who you are!) who clog up the overly small zone entrance,
blocking trains and derailing their flailing lo-on hits lo-on mana
passengers...
Any thoughts? At least I still get exp here...

Thanks. As a Leezard, there is no point in even trying to improve my Guk
faction, is there...
I am well thoguht of (hey a new con message ;-) in FP and Queynos (corrupt
guards still hate me a bit, more potion quests needed), but I cannot be
arsed to get guk faction.
I'll just have to stock up on invis potions. I have my DS potion now, bought
it yesteday to re-do Glox.
I did him with the SAME Virtue that took him down the first time, and
Rinmark. Couldnt get back to TD in time tho, the Virtue went down half way
through the Glox fight- nearly copped it there... Oh! I managed to ID Glox,
and he walked right through the locked door- "darn!" I thought... the of
course he summoned me outside, so now I have a free escape potion!

Anyone with any other thoughts on what level to solo Raster and Targin? Due
to caster adds and the recent Mob upgrades, is it even still possible below
51st? I can get a friend to help, level 55 Monk with a few AA, if necessary.
He needs teh pieces too tho. Could be 80+ hours of camping for us!

I have invested in some Sv vs Magic gear and its a respectable 57 now, I can
gett it to about 73 by swapping in an earring of essence and my PS Ulaks, is
it going to be enough? I'd love this robe before I am 50... Still 45, nearly
Planar, only a couple of yellow to go.

All replies and advice welcomed!
