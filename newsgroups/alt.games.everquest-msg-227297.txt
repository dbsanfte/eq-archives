The 12/4/2003 edition of the Boston Globe has a short story about
pitcher Curt Schilling and his love for playing EQ; one thing the
story mentions is that his former teammate Doug Glanville, who hit two
homers off Schilling in a 2001 game, told an ESPN reporter that the
homers were payback for Schilling's character (which sounds like a
cleric alt) running off and letting Glanville's dwarf paladin die
while they were grouped in Butcherblock Mountains!
