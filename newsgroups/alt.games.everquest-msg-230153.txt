That's a neat trick, considering that PoX does not stack with either the 
mage or cleric mana regen self buffs. For Wizards and Necros, both Po9 
and Fo7 stack, so no issues there.  Preferred raid buffs seem to be, Fo7
+Kazad+Po9+(Brells/SoT/SV)+whatever self buff stacks(wizard and necro).  
This setup gives the same or better mana regen, and maximized hitpoints.  
When Po9 is not available, then clerics prefer IoS+HoV instead of Fo7
+Kazad+Po9, other casters seem to be quite content with Fo7+HoV, as both 
stack with their mana regen self buffs.

If I missed something in here, I'd love to know what it is.
