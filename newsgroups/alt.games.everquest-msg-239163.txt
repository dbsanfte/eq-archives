More than likely it's because the changed haste cant be searched in the
database the way the old effect: haste could be. Someone obviously
decided it would be too much work to make it work again, though they may
have also just shelved it until they have more time. After all, in all
likelyhood they haven't finished the final zones in GoD yet so they have
a lot of work ahead of themselves.
