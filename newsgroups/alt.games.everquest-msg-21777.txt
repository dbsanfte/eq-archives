*groan* And this happens SO often.  We had one guy who I would have SWORN 
was an eBayer except he kept talking about CB.  But the way he talked... 
"Is that a barge? Where's it go? What level is that for? What level are 
those? What weapon is that? Where do I sell?" - anyway, we're sitting 
there recovering, and what does he say? "I'm going to go solo some blues 
while we're waiting."  My reply was a polite version of "oh no you're 
NOT." :)  Another guy we worked with didn't like my pulling only one at a 
time, so once he ran out and found something to pull.  I mashed my 
"incoming a red %t" and all of a sudden I read "I'm pulling a <whatever> 
and it's red!"  *sigh*

The problem is, I'm starting to doubt my grouping abilities.  I've had a 
few groups that have just rocked but they break up so soon - and then 
things just start absolutely sucking.  After awhile I'm sitting there 
soloing again, going "Is it me? Am I going to hit level 45 and realize 
nobody is ever going to want to go on a raid with me?"

I mean, it's either that, or find myself a big ugly stick capable of 
whacking other PCs with.
