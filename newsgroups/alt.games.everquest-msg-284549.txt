Yes, some classes allow the player to be more lazy without bringing 
about any overt negative feeling.

I think that's a consequence of players fighting mobs which aren't as 
challenging as they could be for quick xp.  Certainly there are plenty 
of places in the game where mid-level wizards can deliver a lot more 
utility than they're asked to in XP groups.

I played my wizard in a DoN last night, with a bunch of 600aa toons in 
good casual gear (beastlord tank, enchanter, ranger x 2, cleric, wizard) 
and I snared, off-rooted, kited, scouted, single target succored, etc., 
etc.  I agree with your general point that some classes can be played in 
a lazy manner and still deliver a certain percentage of their core 
functionality, but I don't think we should encourage people to play to 
that level.
