The issue with Iraq was WMD in general.  Why do you narrow it to
nuclear weapons?  Only when discussing North Korea did I narrow the
discussion to only nukes, since North Korea actually has them.

Yes, you are correct.  We should have *never* trusted Chong-il back in
1994.  And once we found evidence that he was conducting research in
secret during the late 90's, we should have done something about it. 
Korea probably already had nukes when Bush took office.  It certainly
had the required materials by then.

The US (and the free world) is placed in a very tough situation.  In
many cases, the only politically feasible way to prevent proliferation
in rogue nations is through sanctions.  Sanctions can strangle a
nation and can do much to prevent it from acquiring nukes or WMD in
general.  However sanctions present two major problems.  The first is
that people like Kim Chong-il and Saddam Hussein will starve their
people in order to maintain whatever development they can.  The second
is that sanctions are best suited for less developed nations with few
valuable resources.  Iraq has lots and lots of oil.  Therefor Iraq has
the ability to trade something of value (oil) for something else of
value (WMD technology).  North Korea doesn't have such an asset. 
Donald Rummesfeld commented on this fact a while back and the DNC
capitalized on the comments to "prove" that the war was "all about
oil".  You remember that don't you?

Sanctions on Iraq helped slow down Hussein's rearming but the result
was the starvation of its people.  Still, Iraq managed to launder
money and sell oil illegally.  The result was, once again, a danger
that Iraq would gain the ability to buy WMD or WMD technology combined
with the endangerment of Iraq's people.  Sanctions just won't do the
job.  How do you prevent rearmament without starving the people?  Now
that isn't a problem anymore...

As for North Korea, sanctions can be more effective.  They still
present the danger of starvation but since it has fewer assets, a
sanction North Korea has less ability to build its WMD programs than a
sanctioned Iraq.

None of this matters in regards to North Korea though, since it is too
late now.

Well it may depend on the leader of course, but a person like Kim
Chong-il chose the later.

Stop stonewalling inspectors and release documentation of the alleged
destruction of the WMD you possessed.

Poor Hussein was unable to prove that he had no WMD and no WMD
programs.  Aw, its not his fault.

Bullshit.  He stonewalled inspectors and failed to provide required
documentation.  He had every chance to prevent the invasion.
