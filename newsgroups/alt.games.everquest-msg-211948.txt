I don't know about Steel Warriors but I noticed on the SafeHouse that
the only real up to date info is usually on the message boards. The game
is old enough now I don't think there's as much inclination as there
once was for FAQ writers to keep working on updating old FAQ's. Same
with the cleric site, the walkthrough for the epic still describes the
original quest with Ragefire in SolB while a sticky post in the forums
has the up to date quest.
