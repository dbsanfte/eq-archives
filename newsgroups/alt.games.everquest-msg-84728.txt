	There are four mobs guarding Maestro, a random mix of Spite Golems and
Clerics, and they don't drop BPs with such regularity.

	During my 5-month residency in Hate, I was usually called upon to Harmony
for that pull, so I got a good look at Maestro's spawn point.  Even with
Harmony you needed a feign puller because the wonko pathing sent whatever you
pulled running directly over at least one other mob.
