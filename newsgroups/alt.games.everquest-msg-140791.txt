Wasn't thinking of raids, this thing is usable at 20th level (that's 10
levels before an SK gets Gather Shadows) but re-reading my post it came out
wrong. The reason it was nerfed was that by chain casting it you could split
mobs easier and by using it with FD you could loose aggro far easier. I was
just trying to explain what was, apparently, desirable about the pre nerf
one in the first place. It costs a fortune as it no longer drops in it's
instacast state and people will pay for that, more money than sense. How
much will people pay for mana stones on Xev? How many zones can they
actually be used in?

Considering the amount of mobs you are likely to encounter, on a high level
raid, that see invis I doubt it's much use on one at all.
