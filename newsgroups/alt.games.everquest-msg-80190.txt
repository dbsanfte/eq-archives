No, they are *NOT* "Drow". Only brain-dead ninnies who can't tell the
difference call themselves "Drow" in EQ. Drow are a matriarichal
society that worships a spider goddess and are highly magic resistant,
as well as having inherant magical abilities no matter what class they
become. None of these traits exist in Teir'dal.

Above all, Drow are NEVER mentioned in Norrathian history. Just
because two races are SIMILAR does not mean they are the same.

Besides, it's not as though TSR invented the concept of dark-skinned
evil elves...
