I'll buy that, I only suggested the parenthesis because, well, because 
as I said, I've seen that done and it worked.  Nobody ever explained why 
the parens were there, thats just how we did it.

Hmm, its been a long time.  Oh, I think it was because the group was 
flooded with spam, but the spammers were 99.99% too stupid to include
(AGE) in their headers, so we could filter out all but a post a month or so.
