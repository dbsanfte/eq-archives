}Jazz:  Was this a tip from your college days or something?

Actually, the tequila and oatmeal plan was from my college days.  It was a 
heck of a lot more effective than the usual raw-egg and tabasco sauce 
smoothie idea most college students somehow think might work.  Needless to 
say, if I had been more awake or less hung over, I never would have eaten 
anything the ex-con living in my laundry room tried to talk me into.  But I'm 
glad I did, it made me feel better and I actually made it to work on time.

Further experience has led me to believe that a couple slices of bread, as 
much water as you can possibly stand to drink, and one or two aspirins, is 
even more effective still, though.  Works best if taken -before- you pass out 
on the couch, but beggars can't be choosers.  The bread's just so you can 
avoid having the dry heaves, so if you aren't -that- bad off, skip it and 
try for a real breakfast.
