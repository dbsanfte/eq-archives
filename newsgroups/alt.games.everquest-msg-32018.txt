"equipment does not maketh the man"
or something like that.
Unfortunately twinking is something that can be quite off putting for the
newer players. In the last 2 weeks I have introduced two friends to EQ and
they both are experiencing the same thing. Altho neither are anywhere near
your level they are both quite dissappointed and feel "inadequate" at the
fact that characters much lower than them have equipment a lvl 30+ should
have, not a char below level 10. But that said, and being someone who has
twinked my alternative characters I cannnot think of a way of compromising
between be able to twink your other characters and making sure newer players
are not overwhelmed by it.
