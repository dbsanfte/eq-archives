Except that they are.  Work means, by Webster:

1 : activity in which one exerts strength or faculties to do or
perform something: a : sustained physical or mental effort to overcome
obstacles and achieve an objective or result b : the labor, task, or
duty that is one's accustomed means of livelihood c : a specific task,
duty, function, or assignment often being a part or phase of some
larger activity


How does EQ not fit any of these definitions?  Why play if there is no
objective?  Undoubtedly some do play that way, but even then they are
putting forth a "mental effort", even if they just tradeskill or run
around Norrath while chatting with friends.

See above definition of work as designated by a generally approved
source.

Not a prize.  Anything you earn is not a prize, but payment.  A prize
is:

1 : something offered or striven for in competition or in contests of
chance; also : PREMIUM 1d
2 : something exceptionally desirable


The competition angle I could see - but in a competition, not everyone
gets the prize.  Anyone who does a quest correctly gets the
appropriate "prize"; therefore, it can be termed recompense.

How so?  They would need to be part of a fairly large raiding force,
and Storms access is a 1 group thing - and I know unguilded,
non-raiding players who have completed the trials and will go no
further than BoT, due to the lack of a raiding force.

Sadly, that happens on almost every server. :-/  I sometimes think
that we get a much clearer view of people's personalities in-game,
because a lot of people do things that they would never do so openly
in life.

But it IS an accomplishment: 

1 : the act of accomplishing : COMPLETION
2 : something that has been accomplished : ACHIEVEMENT
3 a : a quality or ability equipping one for society b : a special
skill or ability acquired by training or practice

The first two definitions are circular (Webster doesn't usually define
a thing with itself) and letter a of the third doesn't apply, but
letter b certainly does.  I've had to train and practice playing my
character, and I have learned many "special" skills.  As far as
achievement goes...well, after the 6 months of toil and sweat it took
to get my epic, I would defnitely classify it as an accomplishment. 
:)

But, we disagree on these things; that's cool.  Nevertheless, I still
think that negating the effort put in by those already flagged is
wrong; access to those planes is not in and of itself a reward, but
actually an invitation for more work. :)
