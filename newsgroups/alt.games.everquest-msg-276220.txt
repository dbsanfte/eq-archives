Clear as mud.

Volumes? It simply indicates that WoW usually has -some- servers up, so 
you can usually play -somewhere-. 

EQ players haven't got backup players because when EQ goes down 95% of 
the time ALL SERVERS are down (or they brought the login server down 
making it impossible to reach any of the ones that are actually up)...

Does that speak volumes too?

Misery loves company. And people who are happily playing probably don't 
even read the forums, especially the whiners rants.

Odd, by all indications its actually been slowly and gradually 
improving. But of course that doesn't work with your rant, so we'll 
conveniently disregard it.
