Psalms?

Anyway, waiting for FM is a waste of time too.  That much mana isn't needed
95% of the time (the other 5% are "oopses").  As long as you're at 60%
you're fine for regular camping.  Hell, depending on the camp 40% may be
fine.

When I play my enchanter, as long as it's a predictable area I often let
them know my status by telling them how many critters I can control.  If I'm
at 20% I'll tell 'em not to pull any more than 2 (and still have enough mana
to deal with 3).  Any time I'm over 60 I get to wonder what I'm doing wrong
(sorta like looking at your check book and thinking "hmm, I have a few
hundred more than usual! Cool!  Oh, wait, WHAT did I forget to pay??") or
the pulls are coming too slowly.
