It's convenient that I've been on enforced vacation (ie, my sister is
visiting and it's rude of me to play EQ while she is in the county),
because I've encountered a small EQ burnout.  Namely because I am feeling
lonely without a guild, but every time I think I've found  a winner
something goes wrong.  One of my best EQ friends said, for probably the
8th time, "I keep telling you you'll only be happy until you make your own
guild!"  And sadly he's probably right, because my husband and I both have
too many opinions on everything from roster design to guild name to loot
rules to the necessity of meaningless goofy events (gnoll soccer!) even in
the most dedicated of raid guilds to ever find the right fit for us.

But of course I'm also picky.  I want a guild to be comprised of my
bestest friends (and their bestest friends...but once removed is as far as
I could go).  And most of my bestest friends are in a guild already.  But
so many times I've had friends tell me "man, if you ran a guild I'd join
right now"...but of course, I dont have one right then, and by the time we
start to talk about it, they are back to feeling tied to an existing
guild.

So!  I have concluded that maybe it's time to try my own hand at a guild
if I'm so damned picky, and the only way to do so is to just get it
started so that when/if the right folks come along, the tag and the web
page and whatnot are ready for them.  (Not the normal way of doing it, but
I never was nor will be a recruiter.  I'm more likely to tell a potential
applicant "are you really sure you want anything to do with us?  Lemme
feel your forehead..." than to try to convince them that "we aer teh
win!")

So here are my questions then...

1.  I know you need 10 seperate accounts to start a guild, but folks can
disband almost immediately, can't they?  THat is, my friends who are
already guilded can create level 1 toons to help me start the guild, and
then they can delete those characters, yes? 

2. When do you find out if the name you've chosen is accepted or
not?  I've seen a lot of wild names these days, so it seems that the only
things they turn you down for are 1) name is already taken (on your
server, or server-wide?) and 2) it is recognizable as belonging to some
offline organization (rock group, well-known novel, etc).  Do they ever
turn names down because "we just think it sounds stupid"?  (I'm tempted to
name my guild "We Aer Teh Win"...I don't think it'd go through tho.)

3. Is there a good link for just how one does these things?  (Ie, I know
you have to log out and go into "chat" but that's the extent of it...)
