And, what have I done, in the name of religion, that would cause such
censure?  Or are we generalizing?

Who are you to say what value I put on things?  Can it be that you value
nothing at all?  If that's the case, than you are truely a pittiable
creature.

Again, what have -I- done to warrent such censure?  Do I force others to
follow my beliefs?  Have I held a gun to your head lately, and forced you to
kneel before a cross?  It is nothing but prejudice that you should condemn
all religious people with one stroke.  The same type of prejudice which
believes that blacks are somehow less than whites, or that women should be
subserviant.
