Sure, with gaters, especially those that are level 51+ and can summon, it
suddenly turns into EVERYONE's job to make sure that sucker isn't able to
get the spell off.  Melees melee, bashers bash (that interrupts, right?),
enchanters keep pounding their stun button, as do clerics.

And now wizzies cast their new (or soon-to-be-released) anti-gate spell as
well.
