Learn to read, troll.

I repeat -- anyone who would follow the trail while "passing through"
WC from Kith to EC (or vice versa) is either "a rank newbie, or
an idiot".

That would be like traveling from San Diego to Florida (or vice
versa) by way of Maine, even if there *does* happen to be a
highway you could follow along the way.

The Shadowed Men camp is tucked way away in the southwest corner
of WC.  Only a "rank newbie, or an idiot" would saunter on down
the trail by the Shadowed Men camp while heading from Kith
(northwest corner of WC) to EC (far east end of WC).  WC is wide
open, there are no obstacles to travel -- anyone who has played
the game for more than a day or two figures out that just
cutting straight "cross country" is the way to go, instead of
following the utterly useless and unnecesssary trail.

Only an idiot would follow the trail while traveling across
EC from Kith.

Or, a troll who doesn't actually play the game, but who glanced
at a map and presumed that players would have any reason on
earth to use the trail.

You expose yourself as a non-player every time you try to
pretend that you do.
