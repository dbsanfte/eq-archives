I originally sent this to Grrlx for her anti-plat guide webpage and
figured I'd better post it here too.

Hi Grrlx,

I love your site, especially the way you slam all those crappy
money grabbing plat guides and such.

Here are a few more tips for real newbies to help them on their way.


Butherblock Mountains Rules!

Lev 3+ (appx, depends on class and gear)

Hunt the skunks in Butcherblock Mounts.
They green out on you by lev 6 to 7 or so but commonly drop
Pristine Claws that sell for up to 4.7PP each with high charisma. 
(4PP/ea minimum)


Lev 6+ (appx, depends on class and gear)

Hunt the goblins in Butcherblock Mounts.
They green out on you by lev 10 or so but drop heads & blood
that sell for up to 4.7PP each with high charisma. (4PP/ea minimum)
There are 3 goblin camps (heavily contested for at peak hours) but also
lots of wandering goblins that drop the same loot.
This is a true cash place for newbies as you can easily earn 200PP an hour
here starting about lev 10 to 11, and about 100PP an hour at levs 6 to 8
owing to more aggro, more adds on pulls and longer down times.


Lev 10+ (appx, depends on class and gear)

Hunt the Wandering Greenbloods (Ogres) in Butcherblock Mounts.
(while hunting the goblins)
They green out on you by lev 14 or so but drop Greenblood insignia
that sell for up to 4.7PP each with high charisma. (4PP/ea minimum)
and 2-handed swords that are heavy but sell for 2.5 gold each and
merchants are nearby.
They commonly wander the path from Dagnor's Cauldron towards
the guard shack called "crossroads", and wander the zone at random.


Lev 13+ (grouped) or 17+ (solo) 

Hunt the Bandits in Western Karana.  They are (almost) never camped
and there are three seperate good camps for them.
They green out on you by lev 17 or so but drop bronze weapons
that sell for up to 2.5PP each with high charisma.
They also drop bandit sashes for a quest to hand in to Chesgard(?)
in the Southern Qeynos Paladin Guild.
He gives you money, faction, and xp for them, PLUS he also gives
you back a random bronze weapon you can sell to the merchant standing
right alongside him.


I hope these help out some.  My "baby" Beastlord below is my newest
character and is better equipped than my 36 cleric from following these
money spots.

Spread the wealth!
