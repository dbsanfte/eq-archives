Greetings!

Now that my anger has subsided, and I can think clearly again, I figured it
is time to ask for advice.......

I'm trying to upgrade the video card on my HP Pavilion 6573Z from the
on-board Intel i810 chipset to an ATI Radeon 7000 (PCI, 64mb)  [I bought the
card because it was in my budget--a whole new system, the real solution to
my problem, isn't.]

My problem:  I follow all the instructions from the HP site on disabling the
on-board drivers to prepare for installing a new one.  I try to install the
new video card... but the system won't start up with the new card inserted.
Just gets stuck at the blue screen HP has show up before Win 98 starts up,
and won't go any further.  My computer makes noises like it's loading stuff,
but then it just stops, and doesn't get beyond the blue screen.  I can't
even get into safe mode.

I've carefully repeated the process several times, following all the
instructions meticulously each time, but same result.

I know the video card isn't bad, because I plugged it into an ancient,
decrepit old Packard Bell, and it started up & detected it just fine.

Besides getting a whole new computer system (not in the budget, and won't be
for quite some time), anything I can do to get it to run?

Thanks....

P.S.  When I go into the bios, it mentions disabling the on-board video from
there as a possibility, but that's just a tease.. it won't let me choose
that option.
