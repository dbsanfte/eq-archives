8 foci, summoned plate armor.

And you know what?  No pet on zone in is simply one
of the things of being a mage.  I would, however,
like a 3rd level of suspended minion that allowed
the pet to be carried across zone lines while suspended.

It's pretty apparent that SM puts some private info
on the mage with Pet type/Pet HP/Pet Buffs/Pet Gear
then recreates it when you un-suspend.(*)  Since mod-rod
timers seem to work similarly (hidden info) and the
timer doesn't reset on zoning, I'd think carrying the
SM data across zoning is doable.

(*)  Suspending/Unsuspending a pet changes it's name,
changes the skin on MS pets, resets enrage, and 
undoes shrink.  Therefore it's a new pet that gets
the buffs/equipment added back to it.
