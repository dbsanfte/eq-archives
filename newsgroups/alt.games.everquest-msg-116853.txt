Yup, those L50+s are there for exactly the same reason you are. For the
plat. Don't you try to tell me that you're there for the exp, because
that's most definitely a secondary consideration on HGs. There are MUCH
more rewarding exp camps around, and NOTHING comes close to the payback
of making a withdrawal from the HG Bank.

Yuo're just pissed because they can killed them easier and faster than
you.
