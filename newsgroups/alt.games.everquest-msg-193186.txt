The other day i heard someone in PoK offering to sell elder dragon language
lessons. I asked for what reason do people need to know elder dragon for and
the person never replies. Hes on Luclin and you often see him in PoK or Nexus
offering to charge like 4k pp for training in it.  Its the biggest scam ive seen
cause i trained 1 point in it and me and a buddy maxed it while soloing yetis.
Apart from that language is there any use for them? It would be good to have a
language that you can only learn at certain levels and requiring you to speak
it in order to complete a quest.
