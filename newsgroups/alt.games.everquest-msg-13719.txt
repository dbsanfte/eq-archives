It is extremely unlikely it will become available for Linux or Mac.  The
only other platform it might become available for is Playstation or
Playstation 2...and those only because they are from Sony.

The problem is updates.  The server and client have to be in sync.  If
they make a server change that requires a client change, right now they
have to update one client.  If they supported other platforms, they
would have to update those at the same time.  It would not be like most
games, where you do one platform first, then do the other platforms.
They'd have to have Windows and Linux (or Mac) teams working
simultaneously.

Well, there is one way they could do it, and that would be to find some
company that wanted to port the EQ client to Linux (or Mac) *AND* who
wanted to run an EQ server for Linux (or Mac) users.
