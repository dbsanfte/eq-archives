>Gnome for tinkering

Human for smithing. 
Started an enchanter too some weeks ago,he has around
1200 hitpoints at lvl 27 and 125 Int,works fine.
I put every possible point in Stamina,rest in Strength.
I wouldnt worry too much about the stats,especially
Int is hard to avoid to raise with gear.  :)

Most expensive items he has are: 
"Robe of Abrogation" - Hp regen +2 ,5k  
"Robe of Topulami(sp?)" - 36% Haste,2(two)k
Solstice earring

Other important items,all well below 500p:
Embalmers skinning knife - for bandages :)
Shaded Dagger 22 del 11 dam,no recommened level.
Set of focus gear:MP2,EE2,BA2,AE2
An especially nice item is "Adamanite Band" - 75 hps and
unbelievable cheap,I payed 150p.

At level 25 he could tank *red* Stonegrabbers in MS,at the end
of a fight he had between 50% and 70% hitpoints left,of course
mob was properly debuffed,thats what an enchanter is for.  :)
