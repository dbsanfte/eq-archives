How does this prove anything?  To me it proves that both you and the idiot 
claiming to have a GM in his pocket know very little about what a GM can 
do.  If a character really had 20 petitions a week submitted for training, 
the GM would most likely engage GM invis and follow the character around.  
If the bad behavior is happening this often, all the GMs and Guides would 
have been informed to watch out for this person, and they would either 
catch him quickly or determine that he's an idiot, but not malicious.  Of 
course, were this true, the best thing would be to sent this to Verant, 
and have them investigate.  If the event in question happened, and if it 
were proven that a GM was involved, there would soon be one very unhappy 
ex-GM.
