It is true.  The wall I ( I have never joined a raiding guild and
probaby never will) ran in to in the bad old days of PoP and GoD was
the ability to work for better gear but not the opportunity.  I could
buy all the AAs I wanted but I was stuck hunting in the same zone for
month after month.  Nothing new to do, nothing new to kill, no where
new to explore.

When OoW came out, and all but Anguish was unlocked, I was finally able
to group in the best XP and casual-grouping zones in the expansion.  I
didn't feel like I was missing half the game anymore.  Each expansion
after that provided me better opportunities for gear and lots to do,
with access to 90% of the "continent" and plenty of upgrades.  I did
not have the DPS or stats of a top raiding guild member but I was
usually doing better than the guys who were still raiding PoP and GoD
(which at least at the time were still on the progression path to
Anguish).  I could not outperform the best geared guys around but I
certainly did not feel like I was being carried when I grouped with
them.

These days they generally just have a few locked zones and getting in
to them is not nearly as bad as it was for PoP, GoD, or even Vex Thal,
Veeshan's Peak, etc..

As was already pointed out, flagging, especially backflagging, just
isn't as difficult as it used to be.  But in addition, much of the
single-group content works this way now.  RSS is open to anyone over 69
but hunting there does require a certain level of gearing and skill.
DoN nest missions had better drops (rare drops as well as cultural
drops) but the group had to be up to the challenge.  DoD missions are
available to anyone of the proper level, but depend even more on your
skill, your strategies, and your gear than RSS.  A large number of
people could not just walk in to the top-end zones and missions or they
would get squished.

Anguish flagging is done almost entirely in single-group content, much
of which is in zones people don't mind hunting in anyway.  It can take
time to get the signets but it is laughably easy compared to what it
used to take to get in to PoP Elementals.

EQ's main problem is the low-level game.  Newbie zones are empty, have
been for years.  Everyone has a top-level character or two and leveling
up is usually a matter of twinking and soloing or being power leveled.
However someone at SoE had a damn good idea when they created the
progression servers.  These are great opportunities for someone to
start fresh and I would certainly recommend everyone give them a try,
even if they have never played before.
