Granted, but that was what I was replying to in this thread. The
theory that a shaman can slow, heal, buff, haste and do CC in a group.

Point. 

I'm biased because on Bristlebane Malo has always been a relatively
cheap spell to get, 20k with a bit of patience. I could've had 3
copies of Malo and 2 copies of Pox before ever hitting 59. Torpor on
the other hand....

Yup. Shaman, druid, Paladin also seems to work well for building a PoP
group around. 90% rez is more than good enough given the rate of exp
gain in PoP.

I was barely 60 when PoP came out but given the resists I've seen, in
the tier 1 spots I hunt (mainly PoD and PoN beyond the dropoff), I
can't see myself doing well there at 51. Woulda been like slowing Zeks
in Kael Arena at 51, a roll of the dice every time unless I had an
enchanter to tash.
