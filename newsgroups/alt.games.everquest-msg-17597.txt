Druid melee skills are level + 1 x 4, so you max at level 40 would be 164,
the only time a druid melees at higher levels, 50+ is when your finishing
off a mob solo or if your fighting greens.  When I played EQ, now just a
lurker waiting for AO, I primarily used 1HD Blunt.  Although my 1HS and 2HD
blunt were both in the 140+ range in case I got a new weapon.  But 1HD blunt
is the way to go, until/unless you get a Epic.  Some examples of good 1HD
blunt weapons are Ykeshan warclub 9/24 75dmg dd at level 40 or the Dark
ember 13/32 +5 wis +20 mana some other stats plus light dd effect.
