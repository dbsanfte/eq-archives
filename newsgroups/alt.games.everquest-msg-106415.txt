Actually, while I agree the tests are incomplete in both scope and
control for testing what AC actually does and how useful it is , I would
also disagree that "ATK is a stat that has a definite affect on damage
output". It doesn't, at last not always in the displayed form. (Please
note the "always" there - I think a core part of the validity of the
claim is its implied consistency... "ATK sometimes has a definite affect
and sometiems doesnt" is a far weaker one)

I think we can posit teh existence of stats that arent displayed by looking
at data, and I would further posit that some of the stats that *are*
displayed are not really stats under a useful definition - ATK and AC being
a case in point.

As an example, compare the difference in damage done by reaching a certain
ATK through strength buffs, then via ATK buffs, or weapon skills with 
different skill weapons that have the same ratio.

Essentially, STR has been shown by parsing to have virtually zero influence
on your damage - its a miniscule amount. Compare that to the difference brought
about by weapon skills, for example. Despite being displayed as an equal
ATK increase they have markedly different influences on damage done.

The reason for this is ATK is (was) *known* to be a composite of at least
two seperate figures that were displayed during beta that have varying
influences on your combat. Now, that was a long time ago and the combat
engine may have changed since then but the trivial STR test above still
shows you that ATK has at *least* 2 different underlying forms that do
vastly different things.


I buff my ATK hugely to 1522 or so just to make the rogues and monks feel
envious, but I am aware a lot of that is simple because I have strength
255 and doesnt really have much affect.

Now, if we're going to say "any number on your character sheet is a stat
by definition", then yes, ATK is a stat... Just a largely meaningless one
that can be used for comparitive purposes in a few very tightly controled
conditions; but then, the amount of copper I carry is a "stat" under
that definition.
