There are two of them here that are just far too entertaining.  If nobody 
responds to their posts they might stop.  Ice Spear is more mana efficient 
than Draught of Ro, at least if both hit for full damage.

Ice Spear is 1200 for 300 mana, or a 4:1 ratio.
Drought of Ro is 950 for 255 mana, or a 3.73:1 ratio
Sunstrike is less efficient at 3.55:1

That's not counting any focus items for either spell.  If all you have is 
focus items for 60 and under spells, that makes Ice Spear even more 
efficient.

Casting time on Ice Spear is 1 second longer.
