My main gripe with EQ is simply SoE. Cant think of one thing done
since the original designers left ( Think Vel was the last release
they designed ) that made the game more fun. Worst complaint with SoE
was the needless nerfing of classes, constant milking of customers
though ill planned expansions (LoY comes to mind first followed by
LDoN which is a halfhearted attempt to copy features of other games),
never ending time sinks,  and a complete disreguard for customer
service and the player base. I wont ever be back to EQ, enough was
enough in my case.
