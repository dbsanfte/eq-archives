No worries, I knew about it when I responded in the first place.
You're quite right, of course. But when someone, anyone, tries to
correct my usage of a word when they are patently wrong, I will
respond, and when they resort to backhand flames and lies, I give it
right back. Suffice it to say my respect for Annie declined
considerably through her tactics in this thread, especially since she
started the flaming herself despite what she is claiming in her
response. I don't like liars, and that includes people who throw
around accusations such as me having lied, or being a hypocrite, and
then refuse to back them up with examples. So far the only liar and
hypocrite here has been Annie herself.

 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
