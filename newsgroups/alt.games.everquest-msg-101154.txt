I half agree.  The Paladin Ro quests are more diffcult than the other Ro
quests, for lesser quality gear.  There's also the fact that a Paladin must
do some.... distasteful things (ie, killing innocent Fairy Maidens, trashing
our Akanon faction in Sol A) that a Paladin ought not have to do.  Of
course, Verant's response has been "You don't have to do the quest if you
don't want to," but that just strikes me as a miserable excuse for poor
quest scripting.

On the other hand, I see this as being the armor version of the soulfire.
Yeah, there's better stuffs out there, but no true holy knight should go
without having done the quests (and it's not as bad as some say).

May not be the most fun I've ever had, but I was certainly proud to finish
my Breastplate.  That's when I went from being a twink, to having earned my
own gear (sure, I still have a few gifted items, but those are the
exception, not the rule).  And Mistmoore isn't all that bad.  Good XP.   My
guild ran a training raid there, and that's where I picked up my granites.
Now, if only it weren't for that innane melatite.

Supposedly, the Vembraces are good all the way to the mid fifties.
