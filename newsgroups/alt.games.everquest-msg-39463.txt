    Howling Stones and Chardok both have spawns in aggro distance from the
zone-in point. You can't exactly have a good pick-up zone if people can zone
in and be killed on the spot. It is my understanding that Siren's has a set
of Sirens guarding the zone-in area in CS - if so, again, Joe Average Gamer
isn't going to want to risk his life just to GET to the pick-up zone. And DN
is on the far side of Siren's, which the average ungrouped character is NOT
crossing solo.

    Velk's, KC, and Seb all have safe zone-in areas, and can be reached with
only the usual hazards of outdoor travel.

    On mine Seb is still packed, as is Velk's. We have enough high-level
players that aren't raid-only that they need to go both places. If we only
had enough for one, I'm sure my server would be like yours, though.
