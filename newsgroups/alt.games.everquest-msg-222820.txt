There's a checkbox in the patcher under advanced(?)/ Unless they
screwed up, if you don't have LDoN checked there you shouldn't have to
download any of those files.

Just to add, I'd recommend LDoN unless you exclusively solo/duo. It
isn't the end-all expansion but it makes for a nice change of pace
sometimes and even the heavy raiders that I know use it to upgrade
that one piece of gear they just can't seem to get a replacement for.
