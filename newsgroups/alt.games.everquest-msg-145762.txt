2 Levels?!?!!?  <GASP>

I have gone nearly 31 levels without one (since being eligible).
Never saw a need for one, at least not with my main.

One of the things that amazed me most was a 51 Ranger I know who has
never taken one, good guy, pretty level headed.  Somehow after 51
levels he decides that "Needsarez" was a good choice in surnames.

/sigh

Personally, if you cant think of one..... she probably shouldnt have
one yet.  Just my thought.  Why WORK on coming up with a name for her.
One day (maybe 20 levels from now)  a name will just come to you that
makes you say "YES!!!!  THATS IT!!!!"

And to me you would only be Ooohlala anyways, as I only play with
first names on:-)
