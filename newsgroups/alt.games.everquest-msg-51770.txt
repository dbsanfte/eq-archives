May turn out to be Monty Haul...don't know yet

Good.

Having to know a hell of a lot about your class is a challenge and a good
thing.

Good.

Don't know yet.

Not true.  If you have 2 accounts you can very well twink.

Good.

Not really used much.  About the same as LFG is in EQ.  It's a very quiet
game...at least at level 8, where I am.

You can smile all you want but this should have been fixed in beta.  It's
not like it's a new problem.  Why the hell haven't they fixed this extremely
important BUG BEFORE we bought the game?  Huh?

I believe auction only in the 3 cities.  Could be wrong.  Doesn't
necessarily negate his negative.

3.  Frame rate really blows.   Geforce2 MX 400 (64MB), Athlon 1200, 256MB
RAM.  Trying to get around the city of Tir Na Nog without running into a
wall every few minutes is virtually impossible.  You turn...and overestimate
it because by the time you get the next frame you're 90 degrees from where
you wanted to be.

4.  Sharp edges.  Just cut a corner just a LITTLE bit and your forward
motion ends.  Since:
5.  ...backing up is MUCH slower than going forward and since #3 is always
in effect, getting into and out of buildings is one hell of a pain in the
ass.

I'll get over 4 & 5 when they fix the really freaking lousy frame rate
problem in this game.  As it is even with 900 people in your realm (or is
that server?) it's almost unplayable.  Except for the downtime it's a LOT
like EQ's first month.
