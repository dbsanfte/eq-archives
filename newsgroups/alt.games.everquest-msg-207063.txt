Thanks to all of the folks who responded to my post about going from FP to
Queynos. Although I didn't take everyone's suggestions (it would take three
trips to do that), all of you did warn me how dangerous it was and made me
cautious enough to finish the trip. It was especially sweet because I had a
miserable session on SWG and decided it couldn't get much worse, might as
well go for it.

Started in Rivervale from the night before. Zoned into Kith at 7am and kept
as high up the wall as I could. I took Lance Berg's advice and banked my
valuable stuff. I did wear the Dwarven Ringmail tunic, mostly because it
resisted magic well and it was given to me by a high level player one night
in CB. I didn't earn it, therefore it was expendable.

Took the invis potion I had bought in Rivervale,,,it worked like a charm.
Whoever said HH pass was a "bit of a maze" really understated it. I went
from exit to exit quite unintentionally. Had to backtrack to find HHK.
Bought the 3 bard songs and drank another potion on the way out. This one
fizzled. Fortunately I had bought 2 spares and the first one lasted well
into EK. I had a terrible time getting out of the pass. I must have doubled
back to the castle four times. Went by two inns. Finally decided to go the
opposite way I thought I should go and hit the zone.

Coming into EK was every bit as dangerous as I was warned. By this time it
was night and I couldn't see much more than the road. I decided to stay
invisible and not start up Selo's and I was really glad afte a minute ot so.
If I had Selo's on I would have gone off of one of those cliffs sooner or
later. After that it was pretty smooth sailing. Had a Lion stick out his paw
and whack me in EK. I didn't stop to see how far he chased me. I also didn;t
know I had to cross a bridge into NK. At night, I thought it was a boat and
avoided it at first. Lots of flying beasties in EK and NK; none aggro'd. The
only dicey moment was in WK. I lost the road and almost ran into an Ogre
Mage camp. One of them cast a spell that hurt (the quesy feeling in my
stomach didn't go away until I was in N Queynos). I know he followed me for
a while and I really think the DR tunic might have saved my hide. I finally
dusted him off shortly before I zoned into N Queynos. Got my armor back and
drank 2 trible bocks to celebrate.

Thanks for all of your help. If I had just done it my way, I would have died
at least 3 times. Now if I can jsut figure out how to shoot that pistol in
SWG...
