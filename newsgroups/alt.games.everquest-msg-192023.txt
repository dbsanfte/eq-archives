Oh, absolutely. But (at least in Los Angeles), you will affect traffic a 
lot more if you travel --legally-- 10mph under the speed limit than if 
you travel --ilegally-- 5mph over the speed limit. Not that I'm 
advocating speeding... I drive like a grandmother, myself, and would be 
a lot more comfortable under the speed limit than over.

/shrug. There are players who are simply incapable of understanding 
concepts like "suspension of disbelief" or "heroic fantasy environment", 
or if they do, they don't give a damn. Those are the ones that need to 
be hit over the head with the rulebook.
