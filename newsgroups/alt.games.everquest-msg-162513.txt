Theres a HUGE difference between a 65 and 60 tank.   In terms of mitigation,
avoidance, dmg versus ac - if you want an example pre-PoP look at Statue
versus Vindi.   Statue is a blue mob at 60 and Vindi is red at 60 - the
damage you do to Vindi is way less your average on Statue..

Try again when a red-to-60 mob is now blue.

PoP trivialised every single pre-pop encounter pretty much, and as you guys
level you will easily be able to take the step upto the next tier without
the normal guild advancement required to do so
