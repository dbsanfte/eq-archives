GOOD dietary practice?  Do you know how often I've been playing and said 
'AFK - getting dinner' then ran off to get the FASTEST food I could think 
of?

Pizza pops, a piece of apple pie, something like that... can of pop to go 
with it.  Oh yeah, this game REALLY encourages good eating habits :)

(Not to mention how fun it is to spill pizza sauce on your keyboard just 
as you're in the middle of a bad train...)
