Main reason trades went away is that what is worth 10k today is only worth
1k tomorrow. While in the same aspect Plat grows in value. What cost you 10k
today may cost 1k tomorrow. With a 24/7 trader I have bought and sold
everything from bandages to a Blade of Carange in 1 month I have taken a
Cowl of Mortality, Fungi Tunic Crimson robe, and 20k to 2 fleshgrinders, 1
SoD,  a Massive Dragon claw Shard, and 522k in Plat.
