Those types of weapons are completely "uber" on a brand new server for
the first few weeks or months. That's the only time that they are
"appropriate" for the level of people who can just barely do the quest.
Some of the higher level quest weapons are probably still top notch on
Kane Bayle.

However, as the server ages and the economy bloats, high end weapons and
armor wind up in the hands of lower and lower level characters, and the
quest weapons lose in perceived value.

Of course, this mainly applies to melee gear. Spells are always
restricted to level, and quest spells are still sought after by some
casters well after the level where they could scribe them. (Brain Bite
for wizards is an excellent example. In terms of caster "gear", the
Phenocryst Focus is another good one. Can be done in the forties with
some strong friends, but still used my many wizards well into the
fifties.)
