I'm not the, um, "sanctimonious prick" you were so eloquently addressing,
but I'll throw in my two coppers anyway.

I do not approve of propositioning children, but I'm all in favor of
allowing consenting adults to do whatever pleases them together.
(In both senses of "pleases them".)  Alas, in a game like this, it's
hard to know whether the other person is an adult or a child (or even
male or female).

Mostly I think propositions for cybersex, like those for real sex, should
be limited to people who actually know each other enough to know that the
proposition is unlikely to be offensive.  If you wouldn't walk up to a
stranger in the street and invite them to have sex, you shouldn't do it
in EQ either.  But of course, there are people who will, in both settings.
The correct response is for the person being asked to "just say no" if
they're not interested.  The proposition itself is not that offensive.
Teach your children that if someone asks them to "cyber", they should say
no, and if the person persists, report the offender.

And yes, I have a teenage daughter who plays MMORPGs, so I have some
first-hand experience with this issue.

p.s.: You may have noted that I avoided mentioning whether I myself
indulge in cybersex.  That's because, like my real sex life, it's none
of your business.

p.p.s.: I've added "cyber" to the glossary in this month's FAQ update.
