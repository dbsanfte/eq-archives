I tried to get from FV to LoIO several times and the
"spiders" quickly terminated my existence.  I tried
following the river each time as I had been told by some
people in FV but just could not make it.  In most zones I
have always followed along the zone edge (one side or the
other) to get through an area way over my level.  Will this
work for this run as well?  If not just what route do I
take?  Thanks in advance for the help.
