Ah yes, the shiny brass halberd. I've always had a soft spot in my heart 
for that weapon. It was the first magic weapon I ever had. A RL friend gave 
my dwarven warrior one of those when I started playing EQ. Heavy as heck, 
but I was wearing leather or patchwork at the time so what did I care. 
Slow, sure it was slow but it was magic. It hurt wisps. It allowed me to 
put a serious hurt on orcs. /grins

Eventually I gave it back. I'm wearing so much metal now I can't afford to 
be lugging it around. (Anyone know where a 17 level dwarf can find some 
decent strength items?)
