The ancient and honorable name of Phillip, which I have certainly
encountered in fantasy literature, translates roughly as Horselover,
iirc.  Not a whole lot of difference between Horselover and
Likespotatos (our friend with the pronoun removed).

That has got to be the most irrelevant and inappropriate analogy I've
seen here in months.  You do lots better just presenting your case
plainly.  Oh well, at least you didn't use the 'N' word (not that I
expect you would).

In this one specific case (petitioning "Ilikepotatos") I find your
insistence on "the letter of the law" to be quite contrary to its
spirit.  The _only_ flaw I can see in that name, from a fantasy
rolseplay perspective, is the "I", which is trivially corrected.
You are, imo, projecting your modern perspective into the game
environment and anachronisticly rejecting a style of name that
has plenty of historical antecedents.
