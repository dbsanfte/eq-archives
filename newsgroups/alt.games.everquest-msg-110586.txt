To an extent.  I think that alot of what theology and philosophy should be
about is discovering what absolute good and evil are.  The fact that we
cannot see it only makes our job more difficult, but not impossible.  After
all, we discovered the atom long before we could measure it.  Over time,
we've had to adjust our theories, when they didn't quite mesh with reality,
but we didn't say that there was no atom because our perceptions were off.
