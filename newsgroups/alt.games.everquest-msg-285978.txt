Chat windows (dimensions, filters, background colors, etc.)
are specified in files named UI_Charactername_servername.ini.
Look for things like [ChatWindow] and [Chat 1].  There's also
a section labelled [ChatManager] that includes info about all
your chat windows, such as their titles, current languages,
default channel if you just type ENTER-text-ENTER, etc.

The spellsets are stored in Charactername_servername.ini (i.e.
the same name except no UI_ in front).

Unfortunately if you delete those files you'll lose all sorts
of UI about your character: screen layout (all windows, not
just chat), socials and hotbars, friends list, etc. etc. etc.
Still, you could try moving the files aside and see if that
fixes your problem, and then look at copying pieces back from
the old files.

Note that you might just be up against a limit of some sort.
For instance, there's a limit of 10 spell sets.  I don't know
if there's a cap on the number of chat windows.
