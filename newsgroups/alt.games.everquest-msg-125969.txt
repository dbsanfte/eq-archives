}I'm beginning to wonder where the young ronin is as well.  I've seen the AC,

}http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/sro/ says that he is on the rare cycle with

}of spawning him that I have never tried.

I've killed the YR twice.  Once in oasis, near the NE corner of the lake.  
There were tons of people in the zone so I couldn't say what made him pop.  
The other time was a couple months ago in South Ro, and was quite silly. 
:)  I was camping the AC (yes, I was camping it! I was the only one in the 
zone and if anything even vaguely PH-like spawned in the desert, it had a 
very short life span.) with a 53 Druid, and the YR spawned in the NW 
corner of the zone... I got there fairly quickly, and he was southwest of 
Ortallius, somewhat north of Dervs.  Now, I have an Iksar Monk who could 
use the sash, but she was camped in S Karana.  However, I aggroed the dang 
YR, and kept him rooted and pissed off long enough to log on a second 
computer and run my butt all the way there, then let him heal up past 
halfway and kill him with my monk.  It still wouldn't let me loot right 
away, despite camping the druid.  Goes on the list of "things that make 
you go 'hmm'".

I also noticed that he tended to pick losing fights with any undead that 
wandered by, which may go some way to explain his rarity.  Bad mummy! 
*NUKE*!

So anyway, keeping rares and undead as dead as possible should help.  I 
wasn't messing with Dervs in camps, only the one derv that wanders around 
the middle of the desert and seems to be on the rares list. (Ow! Bad derv 
faction!)
