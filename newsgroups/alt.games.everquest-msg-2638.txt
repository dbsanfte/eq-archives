thanks! That's exactly what I did... disabled spread Spectrum, then
turned to "Primary Display" (at the start of EQ), and now things seem to
be running quite well.

I've managed a few times in the past to get the card running in FSAA4X,
but each time Verant posts a new set of patches, I've had to go back and
fiddle with the settings again. But your suggestions seem to work really
well.

Thanks a lot!

Micheal.

The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence that it is
not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of
mankind, a widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than
sensible." [Bertrand Russell, "A History of Western Philosophy", 1945]
