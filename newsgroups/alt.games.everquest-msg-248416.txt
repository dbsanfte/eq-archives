Hi,

I'm contemplating having a (very belated) look at the whole world of 
Everquest, as I flit between SWG and CoH.

I would welcome any thoughts as to whether it's still worth buying 
(along with any worthy/required expansions) for a UK gamer, or should I 
just wait until EQ2 arrives this/next year ?

I know that the style of game is fine for me - it's more a case of what 
I really *need* (aside from an empty social life) to play EQ effectively.

Many thanks for all input,

Michael Kearns.
