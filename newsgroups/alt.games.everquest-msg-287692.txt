According to the betas, the talents of druid has got changed changed
and changed. The restro spec has got nerfed a lot.

Well, to be honest. If one class can do all the things best, It=92s not
a meaning of Balance. If you can do all the things, fix all the kinds
of jobs, I don't think you can always be the best, or you must be the
superman.

Now druids has got some buffs:
Balance druids have been greatly improved and you shouldn't see a lot
of OOMkins anymore. Their DPS is now on par with other DPS classes.
Balance DPS looks pretty good now but developpers are keeping an eye
on the survavibility
Entangling roots was allowed indoor to give druids more crowd control
ability in instances.
Restoration were stuck in the HoT niche and were very limited in 5-
mans or raids. Nourish is new flash heal-like spell added to solve
this problem on single targets and Wild Growth was added to give them
an AOE Heal.
Druids were also given an OOC resurrection spell.
Feral druids were decent at tanking and DPSing, but couldn't master
any of these fields. In WotLK you can take all the bear talents to
become a very good main tank, or all the cat talents to have a very
high DPS.
