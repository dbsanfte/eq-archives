Yes...  and here is why...

First thing is...  EULA expressly states that sharing your account
information will get your account banned.  Given that, do you really want to
allow someone to give away your stuff, despite the fact that you are unable
to play at other times?  And paying someone to do it?  That puts two things
into problems for you, your credit information and the character.

And even with the phone call... Any guarentees nothing else will happen to
said account?  Not really.

Interesting... Payment upfront, so...  If they decide to run off with your
money AND your account...  You won't know it until it is too late.

Let's also not forget, they can use the number for other things.  One of
them a possible verification issue.  Submission for Telemarketers, since
phone numbers can be sold as well.  While their excuse for having that
information is valid, it is still more information they can use to cause
problems for you in the future.

Cash?  Yeah...  Definitely not as easier to contest than with say... a
Credit Card...  Or a check, since Checks do require not only clearance, but
a valid account to deposit money and have assets frozen when found to be
fraudulent.

Hmmm...  8 Hours minimum at $35, comes out to $280...  $520 for Raid stuff,
$200 for skills?  So basically... You are telling us...  For roughly what it
costs to pay most Execs...  They want us to pay that much in cash...  Well,
I will say one thing...  They just found a way to get paid to play games.
Notice also, no guarentees about dying, no guarentees about anything else.

Let's also not forget the fact that they can't guarentee the fact that they
could potentially ripping off people.  The fact that they don't try
either...  Means they want to keep their 'company' unestablished as well,
should... Legal issues, arise.

Not forbidden, eh?  Let's see...  First off... The EULA states the
following:

4. Upon registration, you must select a password. You may not disclose your
password to any third party. We never ask you for your password by telephone
or email, and you should not disclose it this way if someone asks you to do
so. There may be an additional charge to reissue lost passwords. Although we
may offer a feature that allows you to "save" or "remember" your password on
your hard drive, please note that third parties may be able to access your
computer and thus your Account.

and

6. We may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and your
Account) immediately and without notice if you breach this Agreement or
repeatedly infringe any third party intellectual property rights, or if we
are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us, or
upon gameplay, chat or any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole
discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as
set forth in the player rules of conduct, which are posted at
www.everquest.com. If we terminate this Agreement under these circumstances,
you will lose access to your Account for the balance of any prepaid period
without any refund.  We may also terminate this Agreement if we decide, in
our sole discretion, to discontinue offering the Game, in which case we may
provide you with a prorated refund of any prepaid amounts.

So... The whole 'disclose your password to any third party, such as
Neversleep, violates the EULA, compromises your account, which, in most
cases falls under section 6, which means, when caught, you will get
suspended/banned.  In this case, more likely banned as it might be
considered a hacked account and most GMs pretty much ban you when you state
that, anything lost due to these guys...  Well, pretty much you are screwed.
So not only do you lose money to 'get' what you wanted... You will probably
lose a lot more.
