None others at the moment, I did 40 in Crystal Caverns on the spiders, and
still do occasionally to farm crystal silk, I'll probably do some Chardok
charm soloing in 53 (glamour of tunare) on off hours (the zone in/out are
usually camped during prime time), I tried the Hole entry earlier on but the
elementals were way resistant to root and I had to leave, I'm going to try
the stuff at the entry of Akheva if I get a chance to (haven't been able to
find it free of bystander PCs to try and get killed yet).  I would try the
entry to Acrylia caverns, but my brief stint there showed a high caster mob
concentration and so I left without killing anything.  I managed to solo a
spider in Velks fairly trivially, but the high competition rate there made
in completely useless to try and make a career out of.

Back when I was going through the spiders at 40, I was taking a break and
had almost finished medding to full, when I see an assling come streaking
out of the spider tunnel to the junction at the pool where nothing spawns
and there's a little room to kite with a dracnid retainer, he got the
retainer down to about 70% hp but was getting his ass kicked (he was a 43
druid) and gated, I kindly finished the retainer off for him with nearly no
trouble (it did keep breaking root fast) and got a crystal webshield for my
trouble.  I enjoy it greatly when people who are too gimp to handle
something difficult do the pulling for me.

Ignore what I said about Quag, he's just as much of a gimp as the rest of
the seafuries, though nearly double the hp, and procs mana drain in melee
(though I resisted the drain the 3 times he procced it with 51 MR the first
time, and 91 the other 2), always drops a  no drop horn for the bard epic,
so if you're gonna kill him, see if any bard friends need the horn first.
Really only worth killing if you need the extra seafury spawn during prime
time, or want to help a bard friend out.  (BTW, the horn is an instrument,
but doesn't have any bonuses to bardsong)
