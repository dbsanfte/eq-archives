Apparently while you can buy it from sh you still need to have pop to be 
able to scribe it. Any know if this is true?
Wouldnt suprise me if the fuckwits at soe made it like this
Not sure if its worth buying anyway
If i do i look forward to the trains i can cause with this and the 
complaints i get, my reply will simply be if you dont like it tell soe 
to un-nerf the harmony spell.
Hopefully Soe will get sick of the non druid classes also complaining 
about about being nerfed and reverse there decision.
