Probably because...

1) Faction reporting is just misreporting...  While it is not reporting
correctly, it does not mean the faction is not adjusted properly.
2) Given Faction is working properly, just not giving you the correct
report of what factions have been adjusted, it is something that can be
lived with until the next patch.
3) Usually, emergency patches deal with something majorly game disruptive.
While not knowing what factions were adjusted is not great, it does not
mean that you are still fubared faction wise, as repeatedly stated by the
GMs and Guides.  IE:  Killing an Orc does not make you Worse, Better,
Better, Better, Worse = Better for Orc Faction.
4) There was already an emergency patch within a few hours after the most
recent patch, which may or may not have introduced the problem to begin
with.

Now mind you, from the looks of it, it seems to be a small coding bug where
either the client or the server is receiving/sending the wrong information.
What is important, is that the server is storing the correct information,
thus, the client could have the bug or the server.  Given some of the
recent roll outs, it looks like the server is just sending out the wrong
information to the clients when it comes to the faction information, but is
storing it correctly on the server, as some of the GMs will tell you.
