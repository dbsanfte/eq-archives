I don't mind it.  Has anybody mentioned that when you have multiple 
characters on Test that when you click 'explore' they're all there 
waiting for you, and if you run into one of them, you switch to that 
character?  I was highly confused when I suddenly switched to the 
typical ranger area until I turned around and saw the druid standing 
behind me *g*  That's kinda useless too, I guess, but, meh.  Nifty in a 
silly sort of way.
