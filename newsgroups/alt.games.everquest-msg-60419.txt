Er, a few words : Buff and Symbol the chanter to kingdom come.

Two words : Celestial Healing...

Six more words : It's a level 44 spell...

Extra words : It heals 748 hp over 24 seconds during which you can easily
use a lower healing spell to keep the chanter alive and well.

Yet more words : Using only Superior Healing on a chanter when you should
have at least Greater Healing and maybe Healing memed is borderline criminal
negligence.

A bit of math : If the Captain wails on the chanter at a rate of , let's
say, 120 damage every 2 seconds, it should take him *at least* 6 seconds to
kill the chanter... If the chanter has Celestial Healing on him, that means
that during those 6 seconds Cel Healing will provide 187 hp (at 120 hp per
Captain's blow every 2 seconds, that means you've bought *at least* an extra
2 seconds during which the chanter could be healed or the mob
stunned-rooted-snared-taunted-blinded-feared -- take your pick).  6 s + 2 s
= 8 seconds.

A few numbers :
- Superior Healing heals 583 hp with a 4.5 second cast time (8 more seconds
of life for the chanter -- thus giving the chanter at least 16 seconds of
life).

- Greater Healing heals 300 hp with a 3.75 second cast time (4 more seconds
of life for the chanter -- thus giving the chanter at least 10 seconds of
life).

- Healing heals 100 hp with a 3.0 second cast time (2 more seconds of life
for the chanter -- thus giving the chanter at least 10 seconds of life).

So, we've established that an aggroed chanter has an
unassisted-while-aggroed life expectancy of *at least* 8 seconds...
And that's without even factoring in the possible
stun-root-snare-taunt-blind-fear possibilities that the other members of a
group can contribute!

Simple words : If a mob heads for the chanter, start healing the chanter. If
the chanter's health bar drops to 99%, start healing the chanter.  If the
chanter stands up, heal the friggin' chanter!

And I'll even through in a piece of advice : just as in planar raids where
clerics sequentially chain-cast Complete Healing on the main assist (main
cleric casts CH, 5 seconds later cleric from group number 2 casts CH and so
on and so forth before the MA even engages the mob), the good clerics I've
had the chance to group with knew when to start healing the chanter or to
start chain-stunning the mezed mobs or even to root them before mez broke.
I'm sorry but stand-heal-sit-med-stand-heal-sit-med clerics are *not* what
being a good cleric is all about.  And by far.

> The moral of this story?  Chanters get beat down no mater what their AC
is.

Wrong.  The moral of this story is that chanters get mowed down when the
healing classes (ahem, clerics being the main healing class) and/or the
stun-capable classes (clerics can do this too, surprise!) and/or the
root-capable classes (clerics can do this as well -- darn, clerics can do a
lot more than cast 4.5 second heals, can't they?) or the blind-capable
classes (clerics can do this, too, but you knew that) don't do their job
right.  Other non-cleric possibilities are pretty much limited to snare, mez
and taunt and fear (and, rats, clerics can fear undead)...

Hmmmm, are you sure they left because the *tanks* weren't doing there job?
I honestly think someone is pointing a finger at the wrong class here.  I
think that if chanters falling like flies in your groups is a constant in
your grouping experience, there exists the very distinct possibility that,
for all the dead chanters you've seen, the underlying constant in their
experience of death may be *you*.

Chanters should die even less than clerics do.
