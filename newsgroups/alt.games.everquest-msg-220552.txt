Why ignore Delenn?  Why not instead point out that she was utterly
unbelievable.  A person of enormous political power among a people
who are totally human in the way personal relationships shape the
power structure, self-chosen to deal with and learn to understand
the politicos of alien peoples, and yet she is totally out of her
depth and completely useless in every single "diplomatic crisis"
she is present at.  It really irritated me to be asked to believe
this pathetic ineffectually manipulative "lost waif" type would get
to her position to begin with, let alone retain it.

Dunno about mythic stereotypes, but Ivanova seemed mighty real to me.
I've known several women in real-life her character reminded of to
some degree, damned fine people all of them.
