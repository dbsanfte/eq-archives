You can use the "viewport" command to resize the full screen window.
This will allow you to create a windowed look similar to the old UI.

/viewport A B C D

A= Number of Pixels from the left
B=Number of pixels from the top
C= Height
D= Width

So if you run at 1024x768 you can do the following...

From the new UI type the following into the chat buffer

/viewport 112 0 800 600

This will give you a window with two 112 pixel borders on the left and
right (1024-800=224.....224/2=112), and a 168 pixel border along the
bottom (768-600=168). You can arrange your "boxes" in the black areas
and recreate a look similar to the old windowed UI.

You can use any values you want for height and width, but for best
results try to keep the 4:3 ratio. Otherwise things will look
distorted. The farther you get from 4:3 the worse things look
(stretched or squished).

There are many custom UIs out there. I remember seeing one that was a
recreation of the old UI (at least as close as they could get).
