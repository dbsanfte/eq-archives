 You can get 14.9 pounds before weight starts to effect you. You'll
normally see the effect by your AC going down. It doesn't effect your
damage output.

 Also, they changed it so as you gain levels, you can also carry more
weight before taking the hit. I don't have an exact number at the
moment, but at level 60 I can carry 24.9 before I take a hit. With lots
of stuff I'm only 11 pounds. I think it's 24 anyway. It's been so long
since I've been overweight I don't really pay attention to it although
early on I recall going a few pounds over on occassion.

 Most monk items are low in weight. You can buy light food and drink as
well. Add a few weight reducing packs (Hard to come by early on) and
weight is easily manageable for a monk.
