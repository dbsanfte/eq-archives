Command:  "/key"

Lists all the keys that have been added to your "keyring" (actually
they've been registered to your character, you don't actually
have an "item" that holds your keys).

Once a key has been added, you are free to destroy the key,
and you'll still be able to open the locked door just by
clicking on it.  The game "knows" you "have"(/had) the key.
