 Some do. Some don't. Peacebring and IFS are a little low (upper 40s-low
50dps range).

 It's not that huge. http://jakefitch.com/eq/monkweapons.xls has a good
comparison. A Dual-wield combo is ranked number one totalling 62.45
damage per second. Moving down some to the two hander I use (Bo Staff of
Trorsmang) it's total is 57.41 damage per second. Hardly a significant
margin in my opinion. Granted real life results wont match the formula
but it should be fairly consistent over the long run. 


If I have time some day I'll parse but in the meantime I stand by my
statement that I am not doing 40-60% less damage using a 2hander. Feel
free to disagree if you want but I'll continue playing my character that
way. If the monks in your guild are dying a lot (not counting pulls)
they're doing something wrong.
