But I'm not talking "over a year". I'm talking over more than
***FOUR*** years since the game went live. And, actually, I'm pretty
sure that I've read that the entertainment industry is doing a lot
better than most other industries right now. It tends to pick up
during hard times, people look for escape. Sony's gaming division sure
as hell qualifies as that...

You realize, of course, that line you quoted there and are trying at
attribute to me was said by someone else? D'oh! Go to bed before you
make an ass of yourself again.

( And, gee, looks who's talking about "spewing shit", trying to tell
everyone I work at McDonalds as if it's a fact... )
