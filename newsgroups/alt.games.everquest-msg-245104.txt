I meant to ask this in the "what's the role of a monk" thread
when someone brought up weapons, but I lost track of that post
and remembered it when I saw the above remark.

Like someone else in that thread, my monk picked up a pair of
Polished Steel Ulaks early in his career, and is finding them
a bit weak at level 30.  But I'm having trouble deciding what
to replace them with.  I've got a bit under 10K saved up (after
buying various other gear) and I try to search the bazaar, but
it's hard, partly because the bazaar search window doesn't let
me filter on (a) damage/delay ratio or (b) weight.  (For that
matter, it won't let me filter on "Hand To Hand".)

The Ulaks are damage/delay = 9/27, weigh 1.1, and give 25 HP
plus a little AC, STR, and other stats.  I've picked up a
Master Wu's Trance Stick at 7/18 with a damage bonus (which
applies how, exactly?), weighs 1.0, no stats, and will proc
for extra damage when I reach level 35 I think.  I also have
an Essence of Dol (10/28, weight 0.1, DEX +5) that I use for
skilling up 1HB.  And I managed to scavenge-loot a Steel Rod
of the Knight from a skel commander, 2HB 35/44, 10 HP plus
some other stats.

I look at things like Knuckle Dusters and see better damage
ratio, but no stats.  Or an Etched Steel Baton for the same
ratio (14/28), but not a lot of stats and weight 3.0.  Those
50 HP from the two batons are a lot at level 30.  Is the extra
damage worth giving up the stats?  Are the ESB stats worth the
extra weight?

Basically, what weapons do folks recommend for a level 30 monk
that I can either quest for or buy at under 10K?
