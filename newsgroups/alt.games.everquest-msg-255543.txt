As a head's up, GoD has some excellent zones to grab some gear for
casual players. In places like Qinimi, Ferubi, Riwwi and Barindu you
can probably duo and get some very nice random trash drops. Heck even
my semi-VT geared character is rolling for the range item in Ferubi.

The random trash loots are the way to go. The nameddrops are actually
worse then the rare trashloot, though much is still very usable by
many casual gamers. Especially the augments which drop like candy from
nameds in those zones (25 hp/mana/end) are a cheap way to get
upgrades.

Qinimi is the easiest and you should try that first to get a feel for
the dps, hp, procs etc of the mobs. The wanderers in the zone are
placeholders for 2 nameds, both can drop some dropable loot and aug's
IIRC. I only killed them for the BiC quest so only seen both up once
or so (never been there much aside from running to the other zones).

Then proceed to Riwwi and farm the arena dry (a guildie necro solo's a
lot there and is making nice pp with the named drops. he even wears 2
pieces himself). Leave the ghosts alone, just kill the guard golems
and all the mobs that wander into the arena to kick ghosts. Every so
often one of the wanderers is a named.

If you can take the Riwwi arena easy enough it's best to try Barindu.
I've not farmed much there myself, but the few mobs I downed were not
much harder then in Riwwi. Only singlepulling is a bit harder for a
mage :). The trashloots are a bit better then Qinimi and Riwwi, up to
VT/EP gear level I estimate.
Do NOT try the large axedude named in barindu though (yellow con).
He's damn hard, not any single group in my guild can take him (we need
at least 2 clerics + 1 patch - and that's just to keep the MT alive).

Lasty there is Ferubi. Several wanderers which move *fast*, usually 2
mobs close enough to not be able to single pull (for a
non-FD/FM/Pacify class that is) and hit harder and have more hp then
the other 3 zones. But if you can convince a group to try it here you
can get some nice exp and the occasional super drop.

My guild is farming a lot in ferubi these days (in single groups) and
we go in till about the middle of the zone, or a bit more south if
there's a mininamed up. The further you go in, the higher the mobs
become. At the zonelines (3 zonelines) mobs are all blue at lvl 65.
Somewhere around the middle you get white cons and the occasional
yellow one. South of the middle portion things start to be yellow a
lot.
My groups had 4 of the range items
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26104) from there
now and 3 of the shoulders
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26115) and that is
from just trashmobs. Heck, we even got one of the shoulders from the
first mob we pulled at the zoneline.


Good luck in GoD, the expansion has a bad rep, but for casuals it's
much better then you might expect. Especially since the nerfing down
of all the mobs to more reasonable hp / dps levels.
