Heck, I kinda agree with you there. :o) (Yes, we have the same smiley...
freaky) I played my enchanter last night, she had so much fun (And me too)
that my boyfriend had to drag me away from the keyboard! :oP I like the
changes they have made to make it easier. Like the loosing of the spellbook.
As someone in my group pointed out: You can actually see the first 35 levels
of the game! I thought I was going to be less pleased with it, as loosing
the spellbook was a rite of passage in my eyes... but WHO CARES! It is a lot
better like this! ;o)

The models? Know what I like? I can be the only Red Head gnome out there!
Gnomes cannot have the wonderful red colour my hair has! Yet, I have it.
(Tip for Race war servers ;o)) Still think my "things" are too big, but
strangely enough, I haven't had anye comment on them, since I got dressed.
(My previous character has a Half Evel Druid) And sometimes it is nice to
look a bit more glamorous than Real Life ;o)

The only complain I have: GROUP with the level 14 and 15 chanters! ;o) They
will breeze you for it! :oP

Solitude :o)
