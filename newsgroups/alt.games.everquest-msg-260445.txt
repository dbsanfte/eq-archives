I don't agree with this.. content tends to be balanced around
mitigation. If you have crap for mitigation you're gonna get cranked.
But I can tank any trash unslowed sans rares up through elementals,
sometimes two at a time. I've tanked 2 sentries in sol ro completely
unslowed at the same time(the chanter went LD). It certainly wasn't 4x
as much damage as a group can expect to handle.

Because of their mitigation. But i don't think anybody is advocating
your pet have the same mitigation as a plate-level tank.

And expecting a pet to offtank mobs that hit for 1100 is asking a
little much. But the 1100 was more dictated by the increasing hp
levels.. then the 75% slow imo.

This can be true.. but it is changing with OOW. Still.. making room
for mage DS on a lot of mobs is still done.

I can double tank mobs that can hit for 900 in Earth without slows,
especially if dps is solid. The mitigation will break most of the hits
down into the 400-600 range or better.
