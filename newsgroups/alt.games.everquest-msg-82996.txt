Only way for you to have logged back in to find yourself in a
different zone is if someone else took you there. Char's. don't just
become corpses and meander their way across zones. I agree with the
other posters. Someone signed on, took your char for a spin, got you
killed and is too gutless to own up to it.

Just curious, you don't like have your password on a Post-It note
stuck to your PC monitor, do you?
