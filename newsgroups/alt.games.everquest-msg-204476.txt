I used to send pricing over to eqprices.com, but now it's so much easier just
to browse in the bazaar... I don't even bother anymore.  
If you have any trouble figuring it out do a polite /ooc - most people are
generally happy to help if they know you are new to the bazaar.

On the ring quest:  even my level 55 ranger still uses her Fine Antique Ring
for casting low level buffs and heals.  It would be great for your druid.  You
can usually get a cockatrice beak off another player in the Overthere just by
doing a /OOC....
