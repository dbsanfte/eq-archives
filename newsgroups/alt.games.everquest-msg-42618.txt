Paladins get Root (which lasts anywhere from the blink of an eye to 6
seconds, in my experience, and usually causes more harm that good
unless you're using it to move up on the agro list or need to do a
quick recast of a self buff you have unwisely let expire in the middle
of combat). My constant partner is a druid, and the free ports to
hunting zones alone make me happy with that choice, but damage
shields, STR buffs, Skin Like <blah> and SoW on demand are very, very
nice as well.

At my level, at least, my general spell casting needs are limited to
chain stunning the target, occasional healing when I've got more mana
than other party members, and AC/HP buffs if no one else in the group
has better ones available (a rare event). So, any and all WIS items go
to the druid (I don't think I have a single item that affects my WIS
rating right now) and AC items go to me.
