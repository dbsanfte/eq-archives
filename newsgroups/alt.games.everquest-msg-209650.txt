Slightly confused by a few things I have heard.

Basically, does the amount of exp required to get an AA point ever change?

I heard that from 51-54 it is like getting from 50-51, but when you reach
55, the exp needed for an AA changes so you need the same amount from 54-55.

I cant see why this would be the case, but would like clarification, as this
would greatly effect my AA gathering.

My current plan is level to 59, then go 20% exp 80% AA until I have EQ +
AM3, then level to 65 and get the rest of the AA's.

Thanks for any replies
