Wow what a difference this makes to partnering with my druid
friend.

Up till now, I've been moderately useless.  She either roots
and rots or quad kites.  In a quad kite, I either use PBAOE,
which is nice but tends to screw up the tight little pattern she
needs to maintain for her nuking, or I nuke to even out damage
and to kill the RIPs (Running In Place; near dead snare locked
mobs) off at the end.

Root and Rot, though, is a pain.  If I nuke, I break root more
often than not, which means we need to reroot, wasting mana,
and during the run time the DOT is doing less damage.  While
the damage I'm doing with the DD is probably better than
what we lose between wasted mana (mine, so not a big deal) and
running (1/3rd of DOT damage) its a pain in the butt.

Now that they removed the DOT penalty, though, we use DOT
and run instead.  This is a great improvement.  No more spending
mana on roots, she casts DOTs and I DD to my hearts content,
with the mob snared we can easily keep it from hurting us, and
since I can get the Aggro fairly readily, she can still use her
long cast time epic by having me run the mob slowly past her
position.

All mana goes directly to damage, as does all casting time, once
the mob is fairly well hurt I stop DDing and let the DOTs run
out the kill for us.  Because the kill is relatively fast, she's using
her more mana efficient DOTs instead of stacking everything
she's got on in order to speed things up.  End result, we can
kill bigger mobs, faster, with less uncertainty.
