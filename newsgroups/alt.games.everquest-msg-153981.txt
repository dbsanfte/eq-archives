You insulted the OP by calling him a "whiner" , that can be construed
as an "attack" on his character. And that does seem to be the way he
took it by his response.

Opinion, or in here, public opinion, is nothing more than what one
thinks on a particular point or subject. The subject of my opinion is
you, so in my opinion you get a kick out of it. That is my opinion on
your behavior. By saying "I believe" that you do, is not a theory or
an assumption because that would mean it has yet to be proved, but I
did say "I" and as far as what I believe, I do truly believe that you
do kick a kick out of it. No theory there. As far as '"I" am concerned
you have proven it many times.

No fabrication here. A criticism would mean that you would read a post
then comment, either positively or negatively about what the poster
has posted. A positive criticism would be agreeing with the poster and
"adding" to his post with some sort of positive enhancement, i.e.
"Your right about that, but if you do this it can work out just as
well or better."
A negative criticism would be disagreeing with the poster and then
explaining why ,i.e. " There is no way you can do that, and this is
why .....".

A criticism is not "You need to get over it, whiner" or "Learn the
internet, moron" or how about " Get over it, jackass" but I love this 
criticism, "You really are a sniveling waste of flesh, aren't you."*
These are insults. And they were posted "without" the OP
responding to any criticism with hostility.Unless of course
you think that " All I did was ask a question?" hostile.
