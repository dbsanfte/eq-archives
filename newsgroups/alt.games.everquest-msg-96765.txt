How exactly is it that you are determining that meditate works for your
level 3 druid?  Your mana will replenish when you are not meditating, just
not as fast as when you meditate.  At level 3, the amount of mana you have
to replenish is not very much.  I can state with certainty that meditate
does not work on my brand new level 2 cleric.
