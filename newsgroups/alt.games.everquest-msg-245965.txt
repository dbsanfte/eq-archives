You are Absolutely Right.  However, we are talking a druid who is new to LDONs,
and there are a LOT of hidden areas for mobs to hide in and around.
Since the level 61 druid in our group yesterday, (who couldn't find her way to
LF by herself), kept casting AOEs and accidentally ending up with mobs that
were around corners, and more than once *unmezzed* mezzed mobs with her stupid
AOEs, not to mention the victims, it seemed better to make a *blanket
statement*.
I wasn't spending my mana healing the paladin tank, I spent my mana healing the
druid and the completely totally PISSED OFF CHANTER because of said Druid's
stupidity.
Over and over we said "/g NO AOEs please!!!" and over and over she kept casting
them.  Yes, I probably should have let her get dead, but that's not my way of
dealing with idiots.  She has taken Place #5 on my *ignore* list though.
