I am KOS to PoG, went up there a while back, accidentally clicked in 
actually while memming spells, was invising myself to move to the zone 
wall so I would have a chance to deal with the protectors without any 
other adds.  Well, it didn't work out, I died.  Got a friend who is not 
KOS to come up, he rezzed me, I already had gate memmed, I looted and 
gated out before the denizens could get to me.  He gated out as well.  
Mind you, he is level 65, so, he had a better chance of standing up to a 
pounding for a bit than you do.

The residents of PoG are on a different faction from the Tunare 
worshippers in Felwithe, and, to the best of my knowledge, the Tunare 
faction is not repairable.
