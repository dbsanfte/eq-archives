Hiya,

normally its not that bad like it looks now ... even if the patches got more
and more the last months ( especially after the new expansion ).

There always will be re-re-re-patches of the patches as SOE messes up things
alot with their patches. The really annoying things nowadays are that the
estaminated time is only a very small part of the patch, so a 4 hour patch
can get to a 9 hour one .... their site will show ALL servers up all the
time ( look at it today ) .... in previous patches they told people what
they were going to change ( ok, now they dont do it as nobody can understand
a 9-hour-downtime for the change of 4 quest-NPC-messages :-P ).

With their growing spagetthi-code even small changes take big time .... and
game gets less playable again ....

I really suggest staying with the game and looking at it after this
"patch-hell" now ... it is still worth it and one only can hope things will
get better again *sigh*
