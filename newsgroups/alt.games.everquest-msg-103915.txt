I'm guessing damn near sixty something if it takes him twenty minutes to
med. The 57 wizard in our guild can go from zero to full in less than
that with no crack. But then again, if he was level sixty, I don't think
he'd be asking that question.

At 24 I was noticing that my erudite wizard meds up from near empty to
full mana in about four minutes. (That's approx, of course. I may time
it tonight because now I'm curious.)
