I logged on to play EQ last night after coming home (would have been around
midnight, I guess), and had my typical problems with Norton Personal
Firewall not recognising the everquest.exe and eqgame.exe files.  Got it
going on my second try, after re-establishing access rights for the two
files.

Anyway, after the EULA screen, the game popped up a screen asking which
video card I wanted to use, and actually gave me a choice between my nVIDIA
TNT2 and my VooDoo2 (which I kept to make certain games run more smothely).
I picked the TNT2, and it brought up a screen asking for further graphics
options.  stuff like texture detail, resolution, lighting (on/off), that
sort of thing.

I thought this was rather cool, and wish they'd implemented something
similar much sooner.

my system only has 96 MB of ram (and no Luclin installed), so I tried going
with the medium quality texture set.  zone times seemed to improve
immediately.

good move on Verant's part
