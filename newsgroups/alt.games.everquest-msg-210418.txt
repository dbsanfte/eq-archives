No, by my logic if YOU go out and are an entrepreneur and sell three
houses by the time you are 17, with no help from your parents, then
YOU buy a ferrari YOU EARNED IT.
If you read what I wrote, it has absolutely nothing to do with your
daddy or anyone else helping you. If YOU go out and get spiderling
silks then hustle to sell them in the bazaar to buy better gear, you
earned it. I don't see where your "daddy having you clean the garage"
thing comes from. That is way out of left field.

Actually it isn't at all.
