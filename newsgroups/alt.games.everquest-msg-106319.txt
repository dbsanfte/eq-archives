Jeez. What server are you playing on? It easily took us two days to
get to wingblades and do the 15 Spiroc Lord kills needed to farm them.
And, this is with a guild that does Halls of Testing 2-3 times a week
and just took down Vindicator for the first time with a near-flawless
victory.

As for the Ball of Everliving golem, I've seen about 1 for every 20
golem kills.
