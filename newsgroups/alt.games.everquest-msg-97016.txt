  Actually, according to what I've read, you can skip over the Darkforge
component of the quest.  The guy who you hand the items to just attacks you
anyway, and the sites I've read said you can just fight him without giving
him the stuff, and get what you need off his corpse to continue the quest.

  I haven't been to the temple of Cazic-Thule since the changes, but I'm
gathering that there is no is no longer a "lizardman ritualist" you can kill
every two hours or so for a sure piece of decayed armor?  I guess it's give
and take... you no longer have to fight your way through a dungeon to get
the stuff, but now your chances of getting something if you can do the
dungeon are smaller.  I personally would prefer raiding a dungeon for a sure
piece of loot than camping and being uncertain about my chances, but I guess
in several levels I'll be happy to have another higher level dungeon to try
out.
