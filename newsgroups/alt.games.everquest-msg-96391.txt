    It was hard to get groups in dungeons because a lot of dungeons were
poorly-created nightmares with high risk for no reward. The only way to get
around the risk was to have a well-rounded party, which means waiting for
key classes to form a party, which means LFG time - which nobody enjoys.
Players remember that. Maybe with the sorts of weapons and armour people
have today it wouldn't be as much of a problem, but why go through that? If
I log on I want to play NOW, y'know?

    Yup. Class interdependance, combined with difficulty of dungeon zones,
creates a "LFG" problem that is best solved by going somewhere easier, where
certain classes are not as important to success and productive groups can be
formed faster.

> The players created it themselves by being lazy sheep.

    Yeah, that must be it. :-P
