Just get macroquest, run the spell trainer macro and go to bed, yes it is 
against the EUL but sitting there casting spells on yourself so you can 
actually cast a spell somewhere else always seemed like a stupid 
requirement.

I am sure I will be flamed, but it is still the easiest way to get a 
character to remain effective (or at the early level gain effectiveness) and 
not have to waste precious time to do it.
