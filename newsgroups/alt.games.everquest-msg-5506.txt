druids and other none-melee classes have they're maximum damage capped no
matter how high a skill you have you'll never be able to compete with a
warrior, paladin, monk etc.

Think about it for a minute ... it would be extremely unfair and unbalanced
if casters had spells and then when oom they could equip a weapon and hit
for as much as a melee class. As a 45 druid you shouldn't be using melee at
all except maybe to finish off a mob that's snared and running away ... well
until you've got your epic :)
