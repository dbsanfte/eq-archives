You've missed one other factor; convenience.  You visit it with the 
location thing, but there's another angle, quantity.  I sometimes put up 
trade mode with (among other things) some odds and ends that are used 
for trade skills or faction.  I put them in at well under whatever the 
current prices list at when I check bazaar, anywhere from 3/4ths to 1/2 
what the going rate" is.  And I can sometimes watch as more expensive 
versions of the exact same item go flying out the window while mine just 
sit there.  Why?  Because I have 1, 2, 3 of them, and vendor X has 
stacks of 20.  If you are doing skill ups, or faction work, then its 
probably not worth your time to run around and clean out the low 
quantity vendors; you want the stuff you need in stacks.

Back when I was smithing, aeons ago when EC tunnel was the place to buy 
stuff and FS plate could get you to 200 skill, I used to pay the unheard 
of price of 2pp per leather padding, or 100pp for a stack of 20... two 
and a half times as much, and still chump change to me, but it was well 
worth it because it caused my suppliers to save up their stock for me, 
and because I didn't have to spend so much time runnning around buying 
2, 5, 7 of the things at a time.

My understanding is that you can get far more than that for the things 
nowadays, which is funny considering that the mobs that drop the parts 
are still the same level as always, and you probably have better armor 
and weapons than even a level 50 did back in the day, And the FS step of 
smithing is much lower level... And nobody will actually wear your FS, 
not even for its later introduced flashiness purpose of being dyable.

This doesn't apply only to tradeskills and faction quest items; most 
people will buy dye from someone who has enough to do all the slots they 
want to change, SOW potions from someone who has as many 10 shots as 
they wish to buy, a full set of Solstice Earring quest items instead of 
part A from Anodyne and part B from Baudelete and so on, even though 
these aren't the cheapest options.
