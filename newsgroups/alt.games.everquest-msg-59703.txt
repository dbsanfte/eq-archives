Had an interesting experience the other day.  Not as interesting as dying 
but not really dying when the Gypsy enchanter bitch charmed me, but 
interesting, nonetheless.

I hand my animation a rusty mace.

"Thank you for the rusty mace, Zymyool."

*blink*  It was instantaneous.  I clicked trade and it said that.  Cute.

Then, about 10 minutes after that I am trucking across WC and I see a Giant 
Spider, so I stab it, it tried to bite me, and my pet spouts off:

"Time to die, a Giant Spider"

I hadn't seen this behaviour previously, so assumed it was a bug.

Had anyone else had an animation do this?  Was it in the latest patch?
