They certainly exist on at least one merchant in most if not all cities, I
found the merchant selling them in Shar Vahl last night for example
unfortunately they are ludicrously expensive.

Options:

Work on Pottery a little and make gate-to-Thurgadin potions, they are no
drop so you need to make your own.  Works out very cheap to make and with a
stock of components in the bank you can make a new one straight after you
used up the old one.

-or-

Track down your local Alchemy practicing Shaman, he probably sells various
gate potions for somewhere in the region of 300pp each.
