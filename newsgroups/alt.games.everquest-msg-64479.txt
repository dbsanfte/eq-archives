I don't have SoL either, but got in around 8pm PST and played for about 2
hours in Oasis.  4 players in Oasis at that time on Terris-Thule.  Only 17
in EC.  Lots of room for me and 2 others to kill crocs until we were blue in
the face.  Lost of problems about black boxes around items or
something...not too sure on the details cause I didn't have the problem, but
lots of people talking about it.   Had a weird problem with the clip plane
all the way in.  Everything was fading and mixing with everything else.
After putting it back out all the way the problem "fixed" itself.  Oh ya it
was taking about 4 times as long to zone and thats without Luclin loaded, so
I'll see what happens tomorrow.

FYI
450mhz AMD
32MB RIVA TNT2
448MB RAM
Cable modem
(no problems really...other than the zone loads.)
