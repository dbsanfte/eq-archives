Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters, "news"
<foo@bar.com> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Ok, so check this out. Im flipping through playerauctions and see a wizard
>for sale at a good price. Im like let me try this so I go ahead and bid on
>it. (yea yea an ebayed character)

HAHA!

You got what you deserved, chump.

Btw its against most ISP TOS to print someone elses personal
information online without their permission.


>1. Buying an ebay character is wrong: well maybe so but thats not the issue.
>To relate the issue in the real world it would be like buying a used car
>from someone, spending 6 months into fixing it, time, sweat, and money, then
>have the original owner pull out his spare key and come steal it back.

You forgot you bought your used car *illegally*.


>4. Real Life Info: Hell yea, theres no rules here. Can you imagine being
>ripped off for $450 plus 6 months of time and work, plus the cost to pay for
>the account for 6 months.
