*glower at no one in particular* Why do all the people I meet in EQ these
days sound like my mom?   

It's not just chatting up a paladin though...it's finding one that is
Keyed and doesn't mind wasting an evening that could be spent getting
XP.  My one paladin friend is online about once a month these days. *small
sigh*  

Granted, I just applied to a guild finally, and there is a wealth of the
holy tin can men in their ranks...I just don't know any of them well, and
I am uncomfortable asking for help when I'm just a probationer.  That's
probably my best chance there, or alternatively the 65 cleric who wants to
come for a ground spawn (and has a 65 SK partner)...but they are in
Germany, so it could be days and days before our times match up.

It's not that I'm adverse to help or company, I just don't care to take
some stranger off the street, and I don't want to waste time looking for
someone while the clock is ticking to the revamp.

The good news is that the Hex* skeletons that drop the dusty skull
sometimes wander near the entryway...rare, but it happens.  I'm fairly
sure Rak and I can handle North and West wing at least, and the glowing
drop in West. So it's still possible. I just got lured in by tales of
folks soloing in south and east wings, but maybe they were 65 with lots of
AA.

It take it, though, that the ability to get single or double pairs of mobs
is level based?
