You can cancel your account so you won't be billed anymore beyond the
current period that you are paid up for. (Don't hope for a refund of
unused portion of payment, but if you're paying monthly, you can have
them stop billing you at the end of the month.

When you're ready to start again, just restart the payment and then log
on with your old username/password and your characters should be waiting
for you.

Throw a dart at a board. The only "regular" server that's anywhere new
is Antonius Bayle. It's in the UK, though, so mind your connection
issues. Plus they did movelogs for it, so it's already got uberguilds.
Doesn't seem to be near the bottom of the population list anytime I log
on.
