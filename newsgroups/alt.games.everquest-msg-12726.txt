I love my mage.  They have the strongest pets in the game, as well as 4
different types to choose from for different situations.  You have a rooter pet
for tanking & soloing (earth), a stunner pet for fighting casters (air), a max
damage pet for grouping (fire) and a balanced pet (water).  Your DD spells are
second only to the wizard, and some of your conjurations will be useful (a stack
of 20 food or water in a single cast, levitation rings, modulation rods,
waterstones for water breathing, coldstones for ultravision, summoned magic
weapons for pets and those without magic weapons when needed, arrows, throwing
daggers, the list goes on).  One thing though - your pet is your life.  You have
no escape spells other than the slow casting gate, so if it dies, you've got
trouble.  Great site here:

One thing to practice, and having played a necro I'm sure you understand, is pet
control.  This is one of the most important parts of being a mage - keeping
control of your pet at all times is your primary responsibility.  Most of the
time it's a breeze, but it can get your entire group killed if you're not paying
attention to what old Goner is doing.  My worst example was my pet falling off
one of the bridges in CC.  If you've been there you know that that's a drop all
the way down to the bottom of the zone.  Well, the ~15 or so orcs down there
killed my pet real quick and came gunning for the rest of the party.  3 of them
made it out, but it was a real bummer.  But, in 41 levels, I've impressed many
groups with how well-behaved Jober is.  Just be prepared for the stigma of
pet=bad from enchanters.  They're all are afraid of us ;-) 

Good luck, hope you like being one of the magi.
