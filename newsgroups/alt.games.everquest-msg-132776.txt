}    You know the ones I'm speaking of.  It seems that some idiot troll has lumped us

}responding to these things a couple of times, and I feel guilty about it because I

}through the various newsgroups, adding to useless noise/quality information ratio. 
}Now, I know that a.g.e has it's own fair share of totally off-topic threads, and I'm

}very tired of seeing long, inflammatory threads going on and on why we should be
}afraid if blacks have civil rights or outraged that a muppet caught HIV.

Yes, mostly they annoy me, but I find it very easy to get drawn into the 
discussion.  I apologize, I'm sure I've done more than my share to help 
make him feel welcome.  But, but, it gets interesting... <sits on hands>.

}   So, I needed to vent, and I didn't want to do it in the very forum I am
}criticizing.  I have to admit, I'm fighting a very powerful urge to find out which
}newsgroup the troller comes from, and then xpost with us such topics as "Which is the
}Best Race/Class to play"?  or

Lol, I like that approach.  I suspect that the majorty of these threads 
are just interaction between us and alt.dss.hack.

}"Is it ok to "inspect" people without asking?".

Yes, as long as you accept the possibilty that they might find it rude.
