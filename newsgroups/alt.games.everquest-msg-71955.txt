Well it's real enough for www.dictionary.com and www.m-w.com to have it,
although I note that both list it as 'chiefly British slang', so you may not
have been familiar with it before. Interesting that it should pass into
Norrathian from 'chiefly British' roots.

dictionary.com says:

ag�gro
n. Chiefly British Slang
Aggressive or violent behavior.
Irritation or exasperation: "Postponing new hospitals and roads causes far
less aggro than sacking town hall or Whitehall workers" (Economist).

adj. Slang
Aggressive or violent.
Daring and skillful, especially in a sport such as surfing.

m-w.com says:

Main Entry: ag�gro
Pronunciation: 'a-(")grO
Function: noun
Inflected Form(s): plural aggros
Etymology: probably aggravation + 1-o
Date: 1969
1 British : deliberately aggressive , provoking, or violent behavior
2 British : EXASPERATION, IRRITATION
