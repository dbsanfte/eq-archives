Rogue is group dependent.  It sucks when you can't find a group.  Only gets
worse as you level with this class.

Evercamp is not for everyone.

Once you hit the high levels you can start exploring other areas more.
However, zones in this game are all level based.  Meaning, find a zone
suitable for your level, then find a group and look for a safe camp spot to
pull too.  Kill the same things over, and over, and over and over and over
and over and over til you
ding.  Then you move onto the next zone suitable for your level, find a
group, then a campspot and then kill the same things over, and over and over
and over
and over and over and over.

There is a reason why majority of the eq junkies are Pale, ugly, antisocial
fat fuckers... lol, but have fun!

There are some twits here who say well its about having and making friends
etc.  But what they fail to mention is party/groups are level based.  So yea
you
can roam around socializing and in the meantime your friends that you made
within a month has outlevelled you considerably so you can't even do
anything
with them til you catch up.. Fun eh?

Flame at will
