}I got kicked from the game while in Black Burrow on level 2. Tryed to get

}again, but the game crashes each time i get near the BB level 2. Now i cant
}even proceed without my stuff, becourse the game crashes just when loading
}ends. 

Hmm... can you log in with a different character?  If you crash a lot in 
one area, it -probably- means you have too many options turned on.  try 
turning some off (like luclin models or emotes) and go again.  And maybe 
move your clip plane in a bit on the second page of options/display.

}I am only Level 13, so its survivable if my stuuf is lost(50pp
}lifetime savings). I would be happy if i could continue without my
}stuff(only money and some basic gear)

Hm, reappearing at your bind point without your stuff means you probably 
died while linkdead.  It also means you're over level 10, right?  So the 
corpse, if you can find it, should last a week.
