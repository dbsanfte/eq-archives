   Yeah, I figured that it was to.  So I enabled the firewall, but it
was no luck.  I've also done the other fixes... changed the datarate
file from 5.0 to 3.0  ... deleted my custom UI files ... deleted several
files suggested by the Sony tech in the Livechat feature of the EQlive
website.  The only fix I haven't tried, and the one that seems to be
working for most people who have this problem, is to be walked out by a
guide or trusted friend.  Lenny and mine computers are side by side, and
we can't walk each other out.  I've written SOE twice so far asking to
be walked out, but no answer yet.  I don't have any real life friends
that have access to EQ at the moment, nor access to another computer
where I might install EQ (out in the middle of nowhere, in a state I
just moved to).

    I'm getting ready to just bit the bullet and log on another server
into the age chat channel, and see if anyone will help me.  But I am
nervous as hell about giving my account info out, even for few moments. 
I've never done that before.  And not to happy with SOE for putting me
in the position where I have to think about doing it now.
