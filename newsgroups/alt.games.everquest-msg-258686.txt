Last I checked, on Emarr, SoW potions sell for 65 to 70 pp, which is just 
barely above cost to make them.  Not worth the time to make them.  If you 
are still paying 100pp for a 10 dose, then, on your server, they are 
worthwhile still to make.

Yeah, but they don't sell fast because the price is fairly high for an 
expendable item.

The biggest problem I see is the cost of the ingredients for most alchemy 
potions, it prices the results out of the market.
