   Well, I did say "this MMORPG".  It also being an on line game, I think
it's a bit more on topic than the "my God is better than you God" type of
arguments we sometimes see here.  But you're right, this is a slippery
slope I'm standing it.  Luckily, I'm not really in charge of deciding
what's okay to post here or not.
