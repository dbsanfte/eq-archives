This tangent regards the -difference- between accepting 'wood elves 
casting magic as "realistic" and accepting 'zoning' as "realistic".

Woodelves casting magic is part of the story. Zoning isn't.

Nobody said we can't look past zoning and enjoy the game. But lets not 
become apologists and try to come up with a rationalization for that 
line in the Karanas that mobs can't cross. EQ Lore talks about forests 
and wide open plains and magical wood elves ... but it doesn't talk 
about invisible barriers segmenting the world into discrete regions.

The former are covered by the suspension of disbeleif but zoning is a 
forgivable but  obvious break in that suspension.

Seeing as EQ2 still has them, I guess the technology of the day is ... 
today. :)
