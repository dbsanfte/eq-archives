    Actually, I read that when it came out.  And what it is, really, is a
guide about what the dead horse topics on FV are.  Sure they deal with some
general EQ issues, but mostly it's about not being an ass on the FV
community forums.  I see a few paragraphs I could lift.  But not half, by
any means.  Though a guide about general EQ in-game Etiquette wouldn't be
an awful idea.  But I'm not writing it.  At least not any time soon.

   Pardon me.  I have to go cry for a little while now.

   Redundant.  I progress about as fast a glacier as it is.  Pretty soon
you'll be harping at me to hurry up so I can keep up with you.

   Anyways, about the "Tips" Section, yeah, it might not be a bad idea.  I
might add it.. but not all at once, and not right now.
