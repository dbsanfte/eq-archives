Definitely some flavor of UNIX, preferably free, like Linux or *BSD. If
Everquest ran on it, I would run out and buy a Mac, because the
combination of UNIX and an Apple-designed interface si simply
unbeatable. The problem with Macs is that you are tied to a single
vendor for both hardware and OS.

Consider how good it has been for the industry to have an open hardware
standard (the IBM PC). It would be just as good for it to have the
Operating System be an open standard too, and have the companies compete
at the application level, without having to worry about the company that
makes the OS that your app runs on suddenly trying to eat your lunch,
and leveraging the OS for that purpose.
