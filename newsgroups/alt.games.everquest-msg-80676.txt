Ok, my partner and I (24 Druid and 24 Chanter) are sightseeing in Luclin. We
wander through Sanctus Seru. Beautiful city, very large, but not much going
on in there.  My Druid buddy say, "I have something weird on my track.  A
File Cabinet!"  So we spend the next 15 minutes tracking down this FC.
Finally we find it inside a big building on the third floor. It cons green
to both of us and it looks ready to attack.  The building is filled with red
conninng npc who are either indifferent or dubious to us.  We debate the
merits of attacking this piece of furniture and finally decide not to as it
might hold some high religious significance to these very strange and
powerful people.  We both bow humbly before it and then depart.  Anyone know
the true significance to this?  We were half expecting to see a blue conning
credenza or red water cooler but were disappointed not to see any.

What's up with this place.  It's huge but relatively empty.  Maybe it's not
finished?
