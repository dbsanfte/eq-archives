OK, My opinion was that he *might* be trying to make some play on words...He
wasn't and I  was WRONG.
I formed my opinion on the basis that I thought he might be a healer class
trying to make a play on words "You make us well" it was a bit tenuous...Had
he actually said posted that he wanted the name "Healz`joo" then I wouldn't
have had any doubt and my opinion would have be as yours seems to still be.
He explained the name was not meant to be that, he is not a cleric and the
name is actually that of a Knight from (his) local history, so my opinion
changed...Why is it that yours is written in stone?

So you won't accept that the OP was not trying to be "clever" or "funny" in
his name?
You don't like his name, your opinion is that he WAS trying to be one of the
above and that's final?

How can I be wrong about my opinion? or How can my opinion be wrong?
