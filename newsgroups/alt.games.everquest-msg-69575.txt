No, you guys attacked me.  You attacked me personally for voicing an
opinion.  Yeah, I'm the one being childish.  You guys started a flame war
because I disagreed with you.  Yeah, I'm the one with the problem here...

No, I defended myself.  And talking shit about someone simply because they
disagree with an opinion of yours is the absolute height of immaturity.  I
stopped doing that in the 3rd grade.  You haven't yet, apparently.

You feign to be other and better than you truly are, and

I never said I was better than anything.  Again, you're making up things
to use against me.  I'm not "feign"ing anything.

Weren't you the one giving me crap about unsubstantiated statements? 
Well, gee, there you go throwing around personal insults not only for an
incredibly childish reason (because, gee, I had a problem with Verant. 
What a prick I must be...), but they're unsubstantiated on top of that.

Who's the hypocrite?

Look, this boils down to the fact that you don't like what I had to say
about Verant.  To reposite this, you call me chidish and immature.  You
throw personal insults at me because I don't like someone you like. 
Instead of attacking the statement, you've attacked the person behind
them.  Then you call me childish because I defend myself against personal
attacks.  You say I'm incapable of reasoned debate, and yet you're flaming
me and throwing around personal insults simply because you disagree with
what I have to say.  You haven't debated anything here, all you've done is
insult me as a person, simply because I disagree with you.
