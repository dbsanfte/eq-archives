oh, I love e e cummings

I've read a few of his poems.  I like when they don't change the 
formatting of the poem.  He uses the page like a painting, if you change 
where on the page a particular letter is, you may change too much about 
the poem.

Makes me sad when I see his poems written in standard poetry stanzas, I 
know he didn't want them that way.  You wouldn't take the Mona Lisa and 
rearrange the colors would you?  e e cummings is a genius poet.
