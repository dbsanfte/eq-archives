You don't give any idea what gear you've got, but you might want to
check out the Garou Bone Club quest (google it).  Be warned that it
requires a rare spawn, best bet is to check the area regularly as
camping it would probably be horribly frustrating.  But really, at
46 much of the better gear you could get "for yourself" requires a
decent group, soloing can get you xp and pp, but severly limits the
gear you can get via drop or quest.
