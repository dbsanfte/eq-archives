Well with out knowing what comes out with GoD when it go live here next
mouth I woud say as pal make alot of points in Nro and wait to buy anyting
befor you hit 65 and then buy the plate armor there, yes that meens you have
to buy armor for PP for the time up to 65 but, the Armor you get there is
pretty good, a mix between Ornate or EP armor in some places.
