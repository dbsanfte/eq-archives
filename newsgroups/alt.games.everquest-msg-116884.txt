I think that was me"Fethdarman"10cleric  I just got bound to that tunnel
last week.
It has been hell. I find myself not fighting a lot because I will be sent to
hell for 20 to 45mins. I can get out when someone walks slow ,I can see a
little bit of a shield or sword. When I get real stuck I reGate and start
all over. I feel bad because I use to see people running into the wall and
not going anywhere.
I would look for a sec  and move on. Thinking, what in the  world are they
doing?
