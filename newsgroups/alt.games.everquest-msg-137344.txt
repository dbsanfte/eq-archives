Look down at the floor, instant zero lag (except on really low-end video
cards, but lag will be reduced nonetheless), and if you know the layout you

As for what SOE/VI screwed up, well, the EC tunnel was chosen on most
servers to center trade around partly because the twisting of the tunnel cut
the lag down when it was crowded.
