I'm not surprised.  A week or so back, I had a task that called for
killing 10 stonegazer fekg`wivkls in Dreadlands, and was stuck because
most of the normal mobs in DL were hiding while Lanys and Al'Kabor
waggled their armies at each other.  (I did spot one stonegazer over
the course of several visits checking the zone.)  So I just found other
things to do for a little while, and now DL is back to normal and I was
able to finish my task.

It seems likely that FV will change back at some point, too.  But I'm
glad that, when I was looking for some new tasks last night at level 35,
and the Task Masters in BB kept trying to give me tasks involving
drolvargs in FV, I kept turning them down until they gave me a task in
another part of the world.  (Though mostly I was just trying to get a
task that would send me somewhere new; I've done a lot of quests and
levelling in FV and wanted a task to give me an excuse to explore
elsewhere.)
