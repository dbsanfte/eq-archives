Legally yes but under Player ethics code which this Rouge lacks he was wrong
the camp had been abandoned and claimed by someone else who was willing to
wait for it. All this Rouge done was steal the spawn plain and simple. I
would love to hear what he would have to say about someone leavening a
character in the Frenzy spawn in Lower Guk and kill the Frenzy while his
group was busy with the Mobs around him. I bet he would be crying and
screaming his head off about a KSer. There is no difference even though
Verant does not honor the Camping system it's the only way that works. Think
about it what type of havoc would there be if you have 20 players all
screaming they hit the mob first he mine.
