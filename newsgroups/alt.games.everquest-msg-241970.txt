I bow to your uberness to have 4 mobs arrive in camp at once and get
them locked down without a wipe.  I'm not sure if any group I have
ever been in could have survived a 4 pull in a 65 hard.  But as I say,
that is far from the norm and any bard that pulled like that for any
but your truly uber group is not doing his job right.  In *most* cases
a long pull with one arriving at a time is extremely preferable.
