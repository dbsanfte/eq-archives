Perhaps his wisdom is low.  Warriors often suffer from such problems, what do
you expect from people who've trained all their lives in how to get mobs to beat
on them?

I"m afraid I can't describe it well at all.  I've thought about leveling up a
monk to raid levels, just so I can actually learn something about areas we fight
in.  Clerics follow the main body of the group wherever it goes, and spend a lot
of time staring at the "group" window, the chat window, the new raid window... I
have the view of the world shoved into a little over a quarter of the screen and
glance up at it on occaision to for some visual candy, but its rarely where the
action is!

OK, really its about 2/3rds the screen and I do get to watch more than that, but
there are places where I have no idea where we are, how we got there, or whats
nearby, because only monks ever go there.  Temple area in Kael is one of those
areas.

We were in a corridor with a corner in it, the AOW was pulled from around the
corner to the left, while we'd approached from the other direction.

I have a bard who is dubious to Kromiff and Kromzek, would that allow me to
explore?  Or would I also need Tormax faction... do Rallos Zek warriors start
non KOS to KT?

If non KOS all the way there, I can see how this would work.

Does that mean that once the 30 minutes are up, he will poof the instant he
isn't running for someone?

I'm not sure we can heal all that much more than we already are, I'm thinking
that if he gets lucky and flurries while tank is at a low HP part of his cycle
we lose a tank and another on transition, so part of what we have to work on is
tank transition.  For that matter, transition to the next defensive warrior
needs some work; we managed it with minimal losses, but the cheal chain went
into overdrive for a bit with two parts of the loop healing at once, wasting
mana.

Aha, well that sounds very much like what happened; melee dying for no reason I
could see.  Turning to attack someone who stole aggro, killing him in one round,
and going back to MA would give no messages and we'd just see tanks dropping
dead out of nowhere.

I also think this, not Cheal chain problems or transition problems or even the
Flurry problem, was the ultimate cause of our defeat.  He bled us dry, not by
killing MA's (each lived an average of a minute) but by killing the damage
production so that slowly going thru the MA body eventually allowed him to beat
us.

I bet its aggro.  There were no Enrage or Rampage messages.  But his damage is
so high that normal aggro would elimate tanks in a heartbeat, and I can assure
you that no cleric was giving a hint of a thought to trying to heal anyone but
our designated MA of the moment.

Supernal Remedy is an amazing tool for tank transitions, slapping out nearly 2K
in heal in under 2 seconds means that it is possible to keep someone alive when
switching over to the new tank.  But we've rarely needed to transition in the
past other than on MA death, and its not something we are very smooth with yet.
I'm thinking of asking for some training time doing it on easier mobs now that
we have an idea what we are up against; like killing Idol unslowed, switching
tanks every 30 seconds on Vindi would give us some practice without much in the
way of consequences (will cost some melee their lives, but hey, its in a good
cause.)

We've failed first attempt at many other mobs in the past... a learn by doing
guild for sure.  A good rule of thumb is that if we can't get the mob under 80%
we can't kill it without more power, regardless of how much mana we have.  If we
get the mob to 50% but run out of mana.... we also can't kill it without more
power.  But if we can get to 50% and still have 50% mana left, then its almost
certain that a little smoother operation is all we need in order to keep going
and get the other 50% done the next time.

Unless of course there's some sort of timer like DT or a despawn or something
like the Trials in POJ where you have to kill faster, not just last longer.
