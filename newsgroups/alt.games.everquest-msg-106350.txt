It's actually a lot more useful than that.  Only place I get lots of resists
on it is in the Grey, but stuff there seems high resistant anyways, but
otherwise it's a dot that STACKS with drones/drifting/creeping (and
therefore also winged death, breath of ro, and Wrath of Nature, but not
flame lick, yes the level 1 spell, it's a dot) which is rather useful for
root/rot targets since it does about 2/3 the dmg of Drones.
