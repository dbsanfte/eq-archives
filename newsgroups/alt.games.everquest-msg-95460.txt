Not really.  Rangers can hunt animals all the way to 60 in Velious.
EW alone can get a ranger from mid 30's to 50ish.  Wooly Rhino's are
still even/yellow to me at 39.  And there are a ton of animal based
mobs in WW.  Only trick there would be actually getting to WW.  I've
only ever done it with my druid and Succor.

And as for monks, I think that it would be MORE inefficient for them
to solo, as to the fact that they lack any kind of utility spells.
Granted, I haven't played a monk higher than level 12 or so, so I
don't really know what I'm talking about there.  :-)

And I never considered bards a melee class really, but that's
personal.  A SK or Ranger, without their spells, still has a
snowball's chance in hell of whuppin up on a blue mob.  Bards without
their songs are toast.  But that's just me.

Really, almost any class CAN solo.  It's just a matter of how
efficient it is to solo.  Even with a regen BP, a warrior soloing is
going to be much, much slower than almost any other class.

Fie.  I still have a hard time in Mistmoore with my druid.  I should
be trying to get him to 60, but I'm just having way more fun right now
with my ranger.
