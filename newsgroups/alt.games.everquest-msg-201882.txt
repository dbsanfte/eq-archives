Actually, I'd like that.  I use rains regularly on my magician and I know
for a fact the only mob I can killshot with a rain is one that will die from
11% to 0% from a wave of the spell.

Also, the reason Jim gives was probably valid at one point, but mobs above
level 55 will leave a corpse even if they've had only 1 point of
player-given damage, and have for about two years now.
