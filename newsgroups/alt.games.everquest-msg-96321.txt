 Not 'any mob'. Any mob level 51 and over. I wont say all because I
think there are probably exceptions. I think there are some dumb green
mobs in Griegs End that summon. Or maybe that's Rampage. Anyway, just
leave it up to Verant to have exceptions to any rule but I'll just say,
in my experience, I've found the above to be true. 

 Since I am level 60 I have no idea if the Ebon Lotus plant things are
51+ though. I'm guessing if they aren't, Verant made them exceptions
since they are perma-rooted. If they didn't summon that would make them
too easy.
