Selos Accellerando, sung  = level 9 shaman SOW
Selos with drum is faster... speed depends on Percussion skill of the
bard and on the drum the bard has equipped.

Shaman and Druid SOW goes up in speed as you level up.  Level 9
shaman SOW is slower than level 14 druid SOW, but level 14 shaman
SOW is exactly the same as level 14 druid SOW.  Level 9 shaman
SOW is of course far faster than level 9 druid SOW

Level 14 druid SOW is marginally faster than Selo's sung... just as
much faster as it is faster than level 9 SOW

I can't give you a point by point comparison, but a level 25 bard
with capped for level percussion skill and a Walrus Skin drum
was a little slower than a 57 druid SOW... I believe what my friend
said was "hey, I'm faster, I'm catching up with you!"  then I said
"Oh?  Hmm, let me try it with Run on", turns out its significantly faster.

At 40 its possible that Spirit of Cheetah is faster, but personally I have
my doubts.  At any rate I hardly ever see anyone mem that spell so
its hard to tell.
