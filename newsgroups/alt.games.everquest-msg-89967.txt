5 halfling bastards invading Nektulos Forest, butchering a lot of newbies,
and "assasinating" (They were light blue/green to level 51) level 49 pets
without being attackable. All the while shouting to the zone what cool dudes
they were.
After I taunted them in shout ("Let's see how you can protect your
sorry little sorry excuses of a mammal kindred in this zone from us"...
"A Leatherfoot Deputy is going to die a painful death now")
it went like *swoosh*, I got hardly time to read
"You have been struck down by the gods.
Pain and Suffering strike you.
You died... "
when I already saw: "Loading, please wait"

Great - Deathtouched for roleplaying along on a GM event.
Man - was I pissed... XP Death at 51 hell level.
Was about to petition when I got a CS Rez incoming message.

I didn't petition, but I was still pissed. This is just lame.
If I cannot hurt them, then them killing me is as low as you can
get. Well - They finally dropped their usual invulnerability flag
and I killed one but wasn't first to loot it, guess what I missed
(Only found out about this later): A Lammy...

Then I tried to get the loot window first on another halfling when
he went down (aka. ninja looting ;) and got a Fishbone Earring
which is VERY nice because it has not only 3 AGI but permanent
Enduring Breath!!!
Was quite happy about it but then gave it to a guildie who had been
a bit out of luck on our last Kael Raid quest armor drop rolls...
