Sorry, but you are wrong. If they release a product, BY RELEASING IT 
they are saying that it is in reasonable, playable condition, with just 
bells and whistles to add and minor bugs to iron out. 

I suggest if you can't handle the bitching then you just stay away from 
the boards/newsgroup and quit suggesting that the people who legally 
purchase a product do not have the right to be upset if that product is 
not what it was claimed to be.
