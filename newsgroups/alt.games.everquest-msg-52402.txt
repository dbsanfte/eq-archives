Agreed. In fact, the pauldrons were the second to last piece that I got,
and I was well into my forties when I got them. However, that still
doesn't change the fact that, at least on some servers (*cough* Xev
*cough*) you never see any of the crafted armor selling "at cost". It's
always above the price of the gems required, and usually twice the cost.
Of course, I suppose the older the server the more this can change. Or,
you might just have a streak of getting lucky on any server and find
some warriors looking to dump them for whatever they can get for fast
cash after they've upgraded one of their slots.
