Over on AGE2 this question was asked & answered but as far as I can tell the 
answer was wrong.

The OP asked if it were possible to get adventure writs (as opposed to 
ironforge ones) if you were unguilded.  She was told yes, you can.  I 
visited 3 of the writ-people mentioned here in AGE and castersrealm and they 
simply blabbered at me when I hailed them...they didn't offer me a quest or 
anything.

Do you do something besides hail/right-click them to get the writs or must 
you be in a guild after all?
