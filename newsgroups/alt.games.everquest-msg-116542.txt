Sorry, don't have a link, although I sometimes go onto the Chat page
on the logon screen and ask there.

I was at the GM event - it was lunacy!  There were over 400 players in
WFP and EC.  The lag was indescribable.  One minute I'm standing there
minding my own business - the next there's some mangy wolf (think it
was a shapechanger), chewing my arse and giving me some kind of hp
sapping disease.  My pet (I'm a mage) just stood there and watched as
I helplessly bash in the command to attack, but the lag was so bad I
just died!

I'm never, ever going to one of these events again!!!
