Supposedly, the items that GMs use are marked RADIOACTIVE.  GM's don't
have spells...they have items with unlimited charges of various
spells, and they use those when they need to do things like gate or
bind.

Rumor has it that if someone without the GM flag on their account
comes into possesion of a RADIOACTIVE item, they are instantly killed.
