To all members of A.G.E. ,

This is an open apology for my "lazy" post, it was taken the wrong way. If
you notice, I said I was posting here "first". I did go online, and look up
the things I listed (thanks to all who posted helpful links) but I know from
experience that it is sometimes hard to find info about a lot of things. So
I posted here before I went searching, just in case there were some things I
could not find, as I know this NG to be a wealth of information about the
game. I apologize again for making some of you think I was unnecessarily
burdening the NG with a request for info I didn't want to get myself. If you
are on Tunare, and ever need help with anything , give me a /t , and you
will find out I am not lazy.
