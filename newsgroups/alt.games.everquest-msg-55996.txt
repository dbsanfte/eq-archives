Im not sure what once you count the missed notes, its worth twising in haste
songs. Maybe the level 50 haste might be worth it, dunno... think about that
in 2 levels, but manasong is very powerful. fear kiting is a good
alternative when appropriate, as is catana. Most of the group that want me
to play manasong 100%, I tend to agree with them.

Give them a choice, either you stay and sing manasong to them, or go and
fight. let them decide. More annoying is the (stupid) casters that wont sit
in range, even during downtime, or the 50% of pullers that pull to out of
range of the casters, and continue to do so after repeated reminders.

Sometimes sow is good. Instant speed, no kick in time like selos. Depends
how tight mana is I guess. hehe ive got a couple of clarities in my time
too. There are a couple of bard songs that use mana, but ive read that
clarity doesnt affect bard mana regen. Educate them is the answer.
