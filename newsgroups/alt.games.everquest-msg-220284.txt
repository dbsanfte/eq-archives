I'm confused, POP is a great single group and soloer expansion up
thru at least POV/POS, which will take you quite comfortably to
65 and allow you loads of AA.  I have lots of friends who do BOT
and HOH and so forth in single group (down as low as duo) and
even a few who solo there too, but its possible that being in a
lower teired raiding guild was necessary to give them the gear
needed to do that, so I have to fall back on my personal
experience which tells me you can solo at LEAST in POS/POV and
below without raid gear.

LOY is definately soloable and small groupable, in fact I don't
think I've ever been in or seen a full group there; its unpopular
and unpopulated, which is odd because the experience is pretty
good and its lots easier than POP zones (exp isn't quite as good
as POP either, mind you, but thats risk versus reward, and I
think you may well get more exp per hour in LOY due to it being
easier to kill each mob)

LDoN does require groups of at least 4, but "normal" runs are
dead easy to live thru, thus garnering pretty decent exp and
interesting loot even if you fail, and not at all impossible to
succede on even with sub par (by which I mean non raid, non
twink) gear if you take 6 man groups in with decent
composition... and thats assuming you can even FIND six players
none of which is in high powered gear, not a likely scenario
these days.

While there's certainly tons of raid action in POP, now that they
killed the lower tier flagging requirements you can see about
half of the expansion simply by leveling up.  Raid stuff in LOY
and LDoN is a very small portion of those expansions.

You may have a point in terms of the SOE philosophy, they -do-
want people to group more and raid more, so they keep designing
raid content and encouraging grouping.  And they want newbies to
stick around and become paying customers, since its been proven
that people who've played for a couple months tend to be less
likely to quit than a heroin addict.  But I don't think POP, LOY
and LDoN make great examples of those points
