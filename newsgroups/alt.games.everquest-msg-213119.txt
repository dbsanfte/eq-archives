Everytime I try to cast a spell, the game would freeze for half a
second before it goes through. The same when I try to open my
spellbook, inventory, or selling/buying from a merchant. Now this is a
new machine I put together (a clean Windows 2000 install with p3 750
Mhz and 640 MB RAM) so I am assuming it may be something I forgot to
configure. I've ran EQ on a much slower machine (Celeron 466 with 512
MB RAM) without ever having to deal with this issue. What would cause
these "mini-lags"?

Machine has been defrag-ed, chkdsk-ed. I am using RamBooster as well
hoping this would do something (but it shouldn't correct this since
the lower RAM machine was able to run just fine).

Thanks.
