Well first off I will say that I'm all for this expansion as it will be 
great for us short on play time family guild types. My only consern is that 
it requires a 5/6 player group, it would have been nice to see some 
solo/duo content.

But the main point of this thread is just some speculation on the sort of 
content that could be included. It seems to me that SoE can put in a lot of 
surprises using triggers.

They can have traps that actually work !
Thay can have ambushes.
They can simulate better AI by knowing that there is only one group in the 
dungeon at one time (e.g. have some mobs run early to get reenforcments 
while others try to hold up the party)
While they say that mobs don't respawn they could have mobs that spawn 
behind the party to keep them awake

They could put in NPC that you have to talk to, and depending on your 
answers different options appear (e.g. they could run or fight or call 
guards etc.)
There could be Mobs that on "death" respawn as "conversational" mobs that 
can be interogated.

Humm lots of options.
Anyone else have ideas of how existing EQ technology could be used to make 
these dungeons both novel and imersive ?

It seems to me that they could make a really wonderful dungeon craw using 
existing EQ teck, with the addition being that they know only one group is 
in zone.
