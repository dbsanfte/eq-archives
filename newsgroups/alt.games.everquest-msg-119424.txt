Lots of us thought that was the case (basing that opinion on posts
to the "eating a death" thread biz refers to among others), but,
whatever Verant's "real" intent, that is not how it works all the
time.  Several posters, including biz, reported conversations with
GMs (on differrent servers) that ended with words to the effect of
"3 hours period is working as intended", nevermind that it only
occassionally works that way.

One of biz's posts had words to the effect of:  apparently we've all
been wrong.
