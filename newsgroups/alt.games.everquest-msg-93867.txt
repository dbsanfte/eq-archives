I hate dealing with support monkey's, because they automatically assume at
the start that I am a clueless idiot.  Of course I am mostly talking about
the level 1 ones, who follow the script they have to weed out the clueless
idiots from taking up the time of the higher level ones.  I can understand
why they would make this assumption, as, likely, 90% or more of the calls
they get are from people who can't figure out how to turn the thing on, or
which way the CD needs to be inserted in the drive.  The problem I have is
there is generally no way to just skip past the stupid script, and get to
solving the problem.
