Hence the quotes. Yes I'm well aware of the connotations implied by using
that specific word.

The player economy only functions properly at the high levels. To
participate in it while one is low level undermines the reward attainable
via low level content / questing. Boycotting it during the low end game adds
(subjective) enjoyment value to the content / questing... for some people
that makes it a better game.

Nobody suggested you must subscribe to it.

It has 'evolved'. So while yes it 'always has been part of the game' it was
not always the flood of items from luclin and beyond into markets 10th level
players can afford. It used to be that lowbies could hunt pelts, sell them
to a 25th level trademan who would turn out armour to sell to other players.
*That* entire economy has long since died... its now earn some cash and get
much better stuff in the bazaar for  much less plat. There is a functioning
economy at the high levels, but at low levels its more beneficial to
scavenge in the dump [the bazaar] than to play the game. Whether its 'part
of the game or not' its lame, and numerous people have no interest in it, at
least at low-mid levels. They are just boycotting it for their own
satisfcation, they aren't protesting it to Sony... so don't worry they
aren't doing *anything* that could even theoretically motivate sony to
change it... odds are the dump will always be there for you.

EQ might have been better.
