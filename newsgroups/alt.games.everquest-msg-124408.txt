What's to argue with?  You've made a pretty outrageous claim
without any supporting evidence.  The burden of proof is on
you.

And I know *why* chiropracty is now considered a legitimate form
of medicine.  You'd do well to research it.

I "believe" in prescription drugs which are adequately tested
under strict laboratory conditions.  i.e., The scientific way.

I do not necessarily "believe" in the "all natural" drugs pushed
by infomercials with no legitimate and peer reviewed research.

I don't think you and I have the same definition of skeptic.
The skeptics I know *do* believe in the moon landings and the
Holocaust.  (As do I.)

: And you won't see how your are being led by your religion.

I'm not religious.  I just don't necessarily believe everything
I hear and read.  The world is full of too many crackpots.  If
someone makes an outrageous claim, they'd better be prepared to
back it up with evidence.  That's all.
