My DE chanter now has ally status in Qeynos even whilst looking like her
little blue self; she killed bandits in the Karana's in her teens and
turned in lots of sashes. It was good money and exp for the level she
did it as well. Of course, she needed illusion:human to do the turn in
(wolf form would work as well, I'd think though) until she got to the
point she wasn't kos.
