Snip

As far as splitting it, you should have done as you did with the bag.
Loot splitting at the end is goofy, it involves someone taking a
powder with the loot and possibly never seeing them again. What should
be done is taking turns or just splitting what you got every so often,
or just rolling on any gems/sellables as they drop.

If 249 plat and those other things are a very difficult loot split
problem for you, I guess you may as well just quit now ;)
