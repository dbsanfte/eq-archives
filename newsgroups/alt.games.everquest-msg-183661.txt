You make somwhere around 30pp per turn-in.  Grab a box from Trep, get all 6 
items, combine them which turns them into the item he wants, then go back 
and get all 6 again.  Go to Trep, turn in the supplies, tell him you're 
ready to get another box, put the itesm in it, and combine them and hand 
the supplies to him again.  Around 60pp profit and used to be a ton of exp 
at 35.  Someone with gate and SoW can do 2 runs in about 20-25 minutes on 
average.
