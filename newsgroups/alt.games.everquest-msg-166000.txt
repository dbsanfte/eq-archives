No carreers, but you can build a mansion, have roommates, etc.  The way to
make money is to get your skills up, and then do things like make pizza, the
logic game, bash pinatas, or play the maze game.  Once you have enough money
to buy said things, you can put them in your house and then when people come
over to play them you get money.

Is it worth it?  Not sure yet to be honest.  I don't think I am going to
continue with it once it goes live.  Beta is pretty fun, but only because
I'm not really paying for it.  I think they need to have basic houses set up
by EA, where people can make some money (money is key in this game), and
then once they have 15 or 20 simoleons, they can't make any more money in
those "newbie" homes.

I think I would wait for a while.  Not many bugs really, but I can't say
that it's really close to The Sims I know and love.  Really annoying in that
you can't bring in your own skins, or your own walls and floors and
furniture.  I would rather that EA put the money into servers that platyers
could subscibe to so that the fan sites with DL's wouldn't all have to go
pay.

If you're a diehard sim fan it's worth it to play beta (and if you really
really want to, I will burn the test cd's for you and give you my name and
login so you can play it), but not worth it to go any further than that.
