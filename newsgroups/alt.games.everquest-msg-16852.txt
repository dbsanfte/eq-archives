You may be able to sell some to non-twinks of non-chain classes but it's 
not worth the effort.  However!  Reinforced leather armor and/or quivers, 
which require HQ cat, are the best (pretty much only) ways to get your 
tailoring from 82 where cured silk goes triv, to 108/115.  You could try 
making Wu's for that stretch, but given the current silk swatch market, 
_I_ sure wouldn't.  So.  Sell the pelts to a higher-level tailor, or store 
them up for when you get there yourself.  But turning them into LQ pelts 
to make paddings?  Aigh!  You can probably get the same price for a HQ 
cat/wolf pelt as you would for the finished padding.  Possibly more.

Do what you wish with the MQ ones, though. :)
