At level 8 I've managed to max Piercing and HtH at
45, Off/Def are easy, as was kick.  Throwing goes
up fast as well, it's currently at 30.  Bind wound
is also at 30.  Really, the only one that seems terribly
slow is HtH, and it finally went up at a decent rate
when I got within a few points of max at 7th.  Fortunately
I'd been keeping it up to the bugged 3*lvl + 3 max
before, so I was only 12 or so points back when they
fixed it. 

I have a slight advantage on BW and Throwing in that
I have my mage summon up a couple of D-pockets each
of knives and bandages and do a dead drop to get them
to my BL.
