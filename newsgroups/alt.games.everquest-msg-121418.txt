I find your  references to "enforcement" of any speech code a free speech
medium like usenet, especially an ALT forum, to be more offensive than any
string of expletives.

Each person has the ability to filter out whatever they find distasteful.
Whether their filter rules contain words like "allah", "fuck" or
"homosexuality" is entirely their own business, and quite frankly that is
where their business ends.
