There are 2 skeles on the boat, and neither wanders at all (nor ever has). 
You pop in directly on the head of one (or rather, directly under his feet). 
You have very little chance of not aggroing them, but you'd have to be so
incredibly weak for them to be a problem that as long as you keep your wits
they're no issue.

Now if you actually do panic and run off with this puny little green
skeleton chasing you, that skeleton is gonna call on all his friends in the
outpost to chase you down.  Much better to off him on the boat (or my
preference pull him out of the boat away from the outpost buildings) where
he won't cause such problems.

Now, all this is based on me being high level too.  I've never aggroed
anything extra in the outpost, and I've always aggroed the skele.  Perhaps
at lower levels it will chain aggro, but I've never seen any mobs real close
by that would be a problem.  More likely, somebody ran out of the boat with
this skele chasing them and headed out of the outpost where you have to pass
closer to other KOS mobs, and of course you've got this skele running along
shouting for help as you run within their range.
