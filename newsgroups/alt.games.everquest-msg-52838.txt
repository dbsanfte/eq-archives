No, we're third rate wizards with a pet.  But our pets are whats going to
eat your cleric for lunch.  I've yet to lose a duel to another magic user
with my trusty air pet by my side and good ol lvl 8 shock of blades for
interrupts and whichever current nuke for damage.

I might fear a warrior or necro, but versus a cleric?  Pet's bash, wind
spell (stun), shock of blades (knockback), I'm not seeing even a high level
cleric casting much in that situation.
