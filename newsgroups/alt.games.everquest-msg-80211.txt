I'm not sure what race he is, probably half-elf or human.  There's a -
chance- he is a wood-elf.  I'll check into it.

I read up on the spawn cycle last night.  Looks like we would need another 
tracker ( Bard can track, Cleric's main [ 55 druid ] can track ) and put a 
tracker in each corner and keep the spawn cycle rotating and hope for a 
Dustback spawn.

For now, I think we'll try to get his Lambent for him.
