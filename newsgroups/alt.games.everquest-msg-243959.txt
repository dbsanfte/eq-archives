Thanks, everybody.
This is exactly the type of info I was looking for. You all have cleared up
so much. That's a lot of info.
----I have noticed the aggro thing big time. Flame Lick and Burst of Fire do
good damage for my level, so it's hard to not use them. I'll practice some
restraint.
----I am also a little dissapointed about the consistant advice to put away
the bow. It's a fun weapon and it's primarily the reason I chose Ranger. You
guys are the experts, so I am in for some tactics changes. /advice = taken.
----As for grouping with a bunch of higher levels, I found that it does
spoil the adrenaline. While it (high level helpers) can be handy when
initially exploring some new level, the fun wears off in a group.
----As for getting around, yes. I am level 18 now, and I'm trying to get
around to every area I can go to without getting instant death.
---- Thanks for explaining the crowd control. I'll be mindful of that in
upcoming groups.
---- I will now consider what the chanter will want, and what the cleric
will have to fix if I melee incorrectly.

does that about sum it up?
Thanks,
Steve
