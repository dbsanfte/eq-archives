In that case, I stand corrected, and my apologies. I see "nerf" as a
"bad word" like, "we're fucked" sort of thing. By your description, then
Necros may indeed be the most "nerfed" class. And, again, by your
description, rightfully so. I guess that falls into the whole class
balancing thing, or everyone would be a necro or a druid now, rather
than the current "only 40%".
<grin>
Seriously..... miscommunation between us. My bad.

Could be.. could be... but again, I'll maintain that a *well played*
Necro can be great in a group. Just like Druids. I've met a couple, even
in the high forties/fifty. But the majority were loner soloists who had
no freaking clue how to group. So I can see where they might wind up in
the "limited end game role", if only from the fact that the rest of us
had to learn to get along for fifty levels without them. Then, when they
realized they needed us to get their epic or see some of the endgame
content, they wanted to suddenly guild up. It's a hard transition, and I
can sympathise with the difficulties inherent.

See Necro above. Virtually one for one comparison. I just grouped with a
Druid in EJ for several days. Outstanding player. It was a woman who
played with several characters in the guild before settling on a Druid
as a main for transportation desire reasons. Always grouped. She was
outstanding and I'd want her on any raid. Sadly the exception, rather
than the rule.

We have our escape hatch when things go south and there's no evac person
in group. It's called "take one for the team". I do it all the time. <g>
If they don't like it, they shouldn't play the class. Part of the
territory, again, IMHO. Equipment dependent? Yep. Part of the class.
*sigh*. And VERY expensive, but I deal with it.

> monotonous to play (few decisions to make with a warrior).

They don't do much group leadership, then, nor use their warrior to it's
fullest potential. I'm usually the "caller of the shots" in my groups
and my job is *NOT* easy. When I fuck up, we die. Different strokes,
again, but if you play your warrior as just a "hit autoattack and go
grab a coffee" kind of warrior, you won't go far. And you are NOT
playing the class to it's fullest.

Again...... mindset. If that's how you see clerics, you definitely are
in the wrong class. If you see them as the ONE group that no high level
party is going far without, the one that will ALWAYS get a group
whenever asked for, and is needed by EVERYONE who wants to keep
leveling, it can be rewarding. Plus, a really good cleric in a well
functioning group where the mobs are going down fast and the cleric
isn't OOM from healing every fight has a LOT of other jobs they can do
to speed the progress. Our Cleric, Tiru, keeps a variety of non healing
spells memmed and uses them to great advantage in most encounters to
maximize our xp gain.

Just like the cleric paragraph above. Depends on the skill of the group
and the versatility of the chanter. They can do a LOT.
