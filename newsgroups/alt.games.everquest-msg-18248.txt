It *is* a damn good time to med.

You know as soon as you get back if something has hit you, too.

One time, I went to the rest room and came back to find three dead orcs 
next to me. My pet was just about dead, but he was a good boy that day. I 
gave him a Chewy Elemental Treat.

> a health bar for your pet

This is actually a good idea, at least in the case of Necros and Mages. The 
theory being that we summon the being with our will and control it with our 
will, so why not easily monitor its condition?

As for the rest.... Bah. Whatever.
