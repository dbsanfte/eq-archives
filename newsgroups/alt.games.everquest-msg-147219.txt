I can't tell you what the unarmed attack dam/del actually is (for a non 
Monk) but at a guess I'd imagine damage is about 2, so you will hit for 4 
or 5 damage a time. As you level up you'll get more damage bonus to add to 
this but don't expect to be hitting for 30 with your fists, ever (unless 
you are a monk) Mobs attack with a different rule set to PC's...if they 
didn't Warriors could solo and everyone else would be really bored with 
killing things.

There isn't much usefulness to Unarmed unless you are a Monk, if you are on 
a corpse run and are attacked it is far better to run to safety than to 
stand and fight it.

What I never understood about Unarmed/H2H is that with Magic gloves/Gaunts 
on I cannot punch Mobs that require Magic weapons to attack...it says they 
are invulnerable but I can Kick them with Magic Boots.
