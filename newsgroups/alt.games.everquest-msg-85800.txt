At higher levels this will be a spell you cast virtually every fight

Depends on the group/zone I guess...  sometimes a shaman has trouble landing
slow (and due to agro reasons, can't really chain cast it if the mob is
hitting fast for 150/200) so it's nice for the chanter to try and slow the
mob too.

Mem blur totally changes about level 35+.  Mobs suddenly have better
memories, and are less eager to forget you (FD included)

> Dump mem blur...root works better and recasts much faster

Root is a very important spell, but remember it will stop a rogues evade
skill working

Stuns are an important line of spells your lacking, as others have said.

Play the game how you want to though, number 1 thing is to have fun.
