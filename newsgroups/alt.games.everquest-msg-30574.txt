Just my op: I think a magician and a necro both get an invis spell at level
8. What they should be doing if they want to hunt is finding an ideal spot
while invisible, then summoning their pet. Up to level 8 there is plenty of
stuff right outside the BB entrance.

Once you find yourself with a quiet little corner and hopefully no spawn,
summon your pet and /pet guard here. From there on you are the puller. A
mage should either use an air elemental or earth elemental because of stun
and root respectively. A necro should always hit the mob with clinging
darkness to reduce its ability to fight and flee.

An ideal spot at 12 would be elite ridge with maybe 2 other players at the
same level. No trains pass through, loot is ok, and the mobs have a
predictible and fairly safe route they take when they flee.

BB will still be less then optimum for a necro in any event. You won't be
able to use fear and ward undead, two of your best spells. Maybe fear when
grouped with a rooter like a ranger, wiz, etc would be OK, just risky.
Clinging darkness and DOTs are really enough to justify having you in an
elite group even w/o a pet.
