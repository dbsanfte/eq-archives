Verant had me very frustrated last week. I bought the de luxe
edition of EverQuest and found on installation the game was
"crashing" with annoying regularity sometimes after only a few
seconds.   Eq support replied to my email with what looked like
a standard reply saying check I had the latest version of DirectX 
etc etc.
After a few days of harassing the vendor who sold me the computer and
being assured again and again the graphics chip set plus 32Mb of Ram
should be able to handle anything thrown at it a patch appeared from
Verant curing crashing under certain circumstances by computers
using TNT and Savage chipsets, mine being a Savage chipset of course!.
So my question why is if they knew they had a problem why did`nt they
just say so. 

As to the game itself I have played RPG`s for over a decade but this is
my first experience of on-line gaming.  First impression was that the
interactive element was incredable and I loved the way other players
were so helpful even coming up and giving my newbie character gear
of all sorts. 

Of course there are assholes out there, one very nice character
gave me a decent spear in Halas only to have someone else come
up a couple of nights later and ask to look at it. Cannot see it
unless you press Trade! Not complaining, I should`nt have been so 
gullible but as a newbie I did`nt want to offend.
I do`nt suppose someone like that would be reading this but if he
is then I can only say I hope his testicles turn square and fester at
the corners.
