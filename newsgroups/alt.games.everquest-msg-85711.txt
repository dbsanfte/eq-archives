You're right, sadly. There is no such key, although others (probably
enchanters) have suggested that Verant should change F8 so that it
cycles through the nearest mobs. I have a feeling they don't want to,
and that F8 works As Intended, but IMO it's an interface flaw, and
ought to be changed...

I'd imagine it gets really annoying for crowd controllers, having to
madly click around, hoping that they'll hit the sweet spot on such
mobs...

IIRC, DAoC has this feature (Their F8 equivalent cycles through the
nearest mobs).

Oops, now I mentioned DAoC, let the flames pour forth!
