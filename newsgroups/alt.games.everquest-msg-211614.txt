Interesting! That explains a problem I was having. I have two PCs and two EQ
accounts. The first account is a few years old and the second one is quite
new. The list of servers on the second account is different and I don't get
a pre-order LDON button on the server select screen.

I posted a message about this in the EQ technical forum and one of their
resident customer service people replied that I should visist the accounts
part of the EQ website and pre-order from there. They didn't mention
anything about downloading it in advance though.
