While my clan does suffer one or two members who refuse to pay attention 
to our "Use of 1337speak will get you ridiculed" rule, I have to agree 
with this totally. I ignore the use of 1337speak as much as possible, 
and where I can't ignore it, I find myself making the odd snide comment 
on how a word is meant to be spelt. I suppose some would class it as 
snobbery, but I'm afraid it's something I will never be able to put up 
with, and it's good to see there are others like me.

As for my own typing, I type as I do here in chat, I often run out of 
space or rack up lines of text, and my only spelling and grammar 
mistakes come from having to type quickly.

There is one thing that bugs me even more though...the amount of people 
who will use 1337speak, and when you make it clear that it bugs you, 
will think you're joking with them and carry on regardless, no matter 
what you say. :-)
