Debateable.  If every melee has a 40%+ haste item, a bard twisting both 
Warsong of Zek and Rizlona's Call of flame can't be beat, providing 125% 
haste total.  If there's an enchanter though, VQ may allow him to twist 
a different song instead of WS.  If there are melees with lower haste 
items, it stacks up more or less like this (assuming averyone's lvl 65):

Bard+Enc (Riz+VQ) > Bard+Shm > Bard (Riz+WS) > Enc ~= Bard (Riz+DotB) > 
Bard (just WS) = Shm > Bard (just DotB) > Poor helpless Beastlord > 
Eyepatch of Plunder

A bard alone is enough haste.  But a Bard whose group has VQ is better.
VQ will get more people to the 100% cap than Warsong will, and the bard 
can twist something else useful, or rest his poor aching fingers for a 
beat. :)
