Where did I say they were the same potion?  The context as I was reading it
was a gate potion itself; I'd never heard of a Thurg Gate potion dropping
off of CT.  Frankly, even if true, it sounds like VI threw it in blindly
unless there's some hidden CT-Thurg connection I've not heard of yet.
But then, when was the last time the loot-drop tables followed much
rationale?
