If you are entirely incapable of comprehending the difference between 
"Barliman" and "Stinkyfinger", I don't feel like wasting my time trying 
to explain it to you, so, would you please just take our word for it? It 
*does* bother us. 

It's the same situation with people who like really loud music, and don't 
understand why their loser, killjoy neighbours complain, and think their 
neighbours should just fucking get a life.

Wait... I'm *really* trying to gather some sympathy for those who 
consider themselves in a hostile environment because they have been told 
to respect and abide by the rules:

/em places his fingers on his temples, and concentrates hard.

Hm. No, sorry, I couldn't find an ounce of sympathy in me for those 
people. Perhaps the fact that they don't have an ounce of understanding 
or tolerance of those of us who would like to enjoy the game as it was 
intended has something to do with it.
