I was trading in EC for some SK gear, and ran across the old
WurmSlayer scam.....

I put my WS in the trade window, and sure enough the person I was
trading with steps up close waits a couple seconds (I assume to lower
their view to my feet) and then cancels the trade. For the next 10
seconds I get to watch them do the "twitch" and move around my feet
(like you see people doing when they drop something). Then I get a
tell "Sorry, here", and the item I was trading for is placed in a
trade window. We finish the trade, and the scammer immediately /quits
and goes [LD].

Needless to say my WS was well protected by an open inventory slot and
the scammer wasted thier time. I got the item I was looking for, and
actually made a profit on the deal. I am guessing that the scammer
finished the trade to avoid a /report.

To make a long story short...

Stay on your toes and keep don't get taken in.

Cheers
