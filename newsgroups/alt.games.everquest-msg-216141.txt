I actually prefer the LDoN groups that don't try to FD or pacify pull.
As long as you aren't fighting too many healer mobs, pullers grabs up
to 4 and you sort it out when you get back to camp. We set up an
offtank order before heading in: Plate tanks first, then shaman (me),
then light tanks (BST, monk, Rogue, Ranger) then mage/necro pets. It's
set up that way not becuase I tank better than the light tanks but
because we can concentrate our DPS on a single mob while I offtank and
if I have an add it usually lives long enough for me to use a DoT or
Spirit Call on it. Seems to work pretty well and at least for lvl 65
(standard) adventures there aren't many classes that can't off-tank a
mob.
