I'm guessing this guy isn't *really* high level or he would understand SOE
policy on kill stealing and camps and he would have KNOWN he couldn't *win*
this argument.   And I agree with 42:

 If SOE won't step in then the playerbase should self-police to 
the limited extent it can. (ie refuse groups/buffs/rezzes/assistance/ 
complain to their guilds ... make sure the players know their behaviour 
is unnaceptable. Then /petition/report/feedback/email gms and make sure 
SOE knows the players find these behaviours unnacceptable.
