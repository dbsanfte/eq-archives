Your threory is good, your math is terrible. 1/4 bandwidth for ACK 
traffic? If that's the case either your data packet payloads are -much- 
too small. Or something else is out to lunch.

Yes. Saturate either and this is true.

Just to throw another monkey into the mix, my cable connection is 5:1 
(5mbps down, 1mbps up... but its also full duplex. This means an ack tx 
doesn't require downstream rx to pause... which changes things 
considerably.
