Hm, at high levels, hunt zones with enough people for at leastc hances
of pickup are limited. There's basically Velks, Sebilis, Karnors,
Fungus and some luclin zones like Maidens. To some lesser extent,
Chardok, Akheva and similar undervisited zones. I quite often have a
hard time finding a group, especially since there's this putrid pest
of level 60ies doing their AA everywhere, giving a shit on anything
lowerlevel (to be honest, I guess I'd be such a pest, too .. still
hate it *grin*). I know hteres a shitload more with zones of this
levelrange (Burning Woods, The Grey and so on), but it's just hard to
find people.
