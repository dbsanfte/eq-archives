Actually, it's easy to avoid the FP Militia when doing the
Janam/Rebby letter quests, I've done it dozens of times while
KoS to the FP Militia.

Hint:  Tunnels.  Hint #2:  There are 3 tunnels snaking
through W.FP, not just the 1 or 2 that most people are
familiar with.

HOWEVER, his bigger problem is that Rebby himself is on the
CoalitionOfTradeFolkIll faction, and since Jazz is KoS to them
as well, this means that Rebby will attempt to kill him as he
tries to deliver the letter to him.  No go.
