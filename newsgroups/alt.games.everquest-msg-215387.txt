You're purposefully using a piece of software designed to read text messages
that doesn't wrap long lines?

Somebody purposefully wrote a piece of trash like that?!?

Seriously...  on the programmer's checklist for what to put into a text

I hope it's freeware or you at least had the decency to warez it and not
actually support such a stupid programmer.  :)
