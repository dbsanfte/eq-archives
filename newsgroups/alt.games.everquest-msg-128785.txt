I'll tell you what's easy.  It's easy to see how any conflict evenutally
ends.  It ends when one side completely destroys the will of the opposition,
and breaks their desire to fight.  This is what happened in the War of
Northern Aggression (Civil War, to the rest of y'all), when Sherman raized
Georgia... he broke the South's will.  It's what happened in WW-II when we
caused massive destruction to Berlin, and the rest of the nation was
occupied.  It's what happened in Japan, when we dropped two atomic bombs on
their cities.  Conversely, it's what happened in Viet'nam, when the NV
simply waited for our own culture to turn against us... we broke our own
will.

History has shown how these conflicts will end.  Knowing that, there are
only two conditions in which the Middle East will be at peace.

First:  The nation of Isreal ceases to exist.
Second:  Isreal has made the fighting so painful for hostile nations that
they no longer desire the first option, they just want it to end... in other
words Isreal breaks the terrorist nations.

If Isreal doesn't keep fighting, they will fade into the night.  Can anyone
justify why that would be a good thing?
