Ditto here, usually before I ding again, I've got all my spells, and
when I'm coming up on a power level(14 druid for example)  I had SoW and
Bind sitting on her for half of 13.  I didn't pick up summon food and
drink till 14.5 and I think there is still one I need,  but It's
inconsequential.  I dropped 100+ plat on spells, and now I'm back at
100.  Course, I'm a tailor.  I'll never be rich, but never broke
either.  I saw some moron(nothing personal guy) auctioning tailored
large bags for at 10pp for 1 15pp for the both.  I get people coming
back for more at 25 per.  So....  If I'd had the main inventory space, I
would have taken them off the market for a later date.
