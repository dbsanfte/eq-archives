Hi all!

(Me, Me, Me! LA!!! LA!!!! A 1 & a 2)

WHAT BUTT UGLY STUPID MADE IN CHINA FATHEAD SCREWED WITH MY INTERFACE!

NONE OF MY T.KING MODS WILL LOAD ANYMORE! I PAYED FOR THEM TOO!

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TWIST SONGS & MAKE LIKE A SONG BIRD IF I HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE MOST BLAAAAAA INTERFACE ON EARTH?!

WHAT HAPPENED AT SOE? DID THE DEV'S FINALLY TAKE A COLLECTIVE LOOK AT
THEMSELVES, SHAVE THEIR BUTTS AND LEARN TO WALK BACKWARDS?!!

THERE BETTER BE A PATCH AND IT BETTER BE QUICK!
