Hm.. I have a GeForce 3 and it works quite well in the bazaar, actually.
I've also got 768 mb of ram, but, well, it's the card that is making the
difference.  Of course you are going to get lag in the bazaar, yes, the
video card is going to limit it by (A LOT), but it isn't going to get rid of
it completely.  I very much want the new GeForceFX card, though.  Has anyone
gotten one of these yet?  How are they liking them?
