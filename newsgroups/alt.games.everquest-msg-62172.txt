Greetings, I come to you guys in hope of a solution.  I downloaded the
patches, the DX8, updated drivers for video and sound.  Changed the
eqclient.ini like I had read, and I get about 5 minutes of play before the
whole thing locks up.  The keyboard and everything.  It is only with
Everquest, so I know its not my hardware.  Any ideas on what I might be
missing?

Thanks in advance.
