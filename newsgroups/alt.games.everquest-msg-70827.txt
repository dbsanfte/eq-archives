I recently change resolution from 480 - 600 to 800 - 600 because the
picture was so choppy in the former resolution. (GForce 32mb MX MX 400
video card with the latest DirectX drivers) The new setting is much
begetter, but it introduces  a phenomena that I have never seen
before. i.e. When looting a corpse, a transparent version of Inventory
and all the elements of the Persona are presented square in the middle
of the screen. This was a bother at first, but I have become
accustomed to it. That said, I would like to know how to toggle this
effect.(F10 just changes the display  In the normal way)

Any thoughts?
