Right... Sony is going to open an item store, and not encourage you to 
patronize it... what cloud are you on??

I already allowed for that need, and suggested a CoH like solution 
instead of a 'buy your way up'. There are other possibilities too. (e.g. 
Reverse CoH, AC1-like xp distribution, and others)

Your right to a point, but gear is a lot more relevant in EQ than your 
giving it credit for. "Playing EQ" by and large is easy enough for a 
trained monkey, for most classes, in most xp groups.

Neither is golf; its between you and your previous scores, you and your 
handicap, you and the course. But people still don't like playing with 
other people who are blatantly cheating, even though it doesn't affect 
their own score in any way.
