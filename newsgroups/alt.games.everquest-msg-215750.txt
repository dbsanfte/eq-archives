Although the tests you mention are indeed a bit dated, they aren't relevant to
the discussion at hand, which is whether a shaman or mana is a better healer in
their 30s.

Neither will have KEI; at best they'll have Clarity, and if there's no enchanter
in the group even that will be wearing off partway thru the adventure.  Did you
say that clerics benefit more from mana regen enhancement than shaman do?
Yep... well the converse is true, shaman suffer less from lack of mana regen
than clerics do.  Neither will have any AA at all; if they both have 255 wisdom
I'll be very surprised.  So if clerics benefit more from a deeper mana pool,
guess what, that would imply that the shaman is better off in his 30s.  Both
shaman and clerics are capable of wearing the same heal extending gear if they
can afford it, neither can have AA for it, nor can the cleric have his critical
heal AA.  Fast heal for a 30s cleric is same spell as the shaman is using;
admittedly the cleric does have a better big heal post 34, but not a better
"fast heal".  No AA elixer, no clicky heals (not legs, not even valor arms yet,
won't proc till 46); all the differences you come up with between two 65
characters (heck, even two 60 characters) pretty much vanish or even tend to
favor the shaman instead at these low levels.

Now I've argued the point the other direction; I feel the cleric is more likely
than the shaman to be specialized in alteration, to have an Improved Healing
item, and that there is some advantage to his having the low level HOTs he does
have handy... but those are reasons that work at 30something, while the ones
you've listed do not.
