No worries.. i don't take much stuff personally. Life is too short.

NP... i'm having to reevaluate them myself.

I've never seen Warriors as agro masters, i've always viewed them as
the masters of damage taking. We're there to live through situations
that would kill most other classes.

Incorrect, if anything.. the skill aspects have been ramped up. ATM,
i'm running like 9.6k hp raid buffed.. around 1600-1700 AC. Not
exceptional gear.. but certainly not shit(well.. maybe to GoD geared
tanks :>). I can tank easily in the Elementals and do so when i'm
pounding out AA. At the same time I have a friend that is running
10.6khp(elemental only.. none of the fancy mods like Shielding)...
like 1900AC. If we both go into Tipt and try to tank it straight up...
a druid and cleric simply can't keep us living without both fast
patching.. and even then the mobs seem to just ignore your AC from
time to time and Bad Round you to hell and back. And when its working
heal mana drops pretty fast after 4-5 mobs.

The standard way that i've seen groups try to get around this is to
have a chanter get a dark blue charm pet that hits 1200 with 40khp,
amp it up, and have it tank. Warrior typically agros on a charm break,
CC(druid and sometimes pally or ranger) controls the pet. If the pet
gets the chanter first root, rezz and rewash. And because you have pet
tanking.. all sorts of weird agro situations can occur if more than 3
or 4 people get on the main mobs agro list. When its working you blow
through mobs in 10-15 seconds, which makes it shiek to a lot of
groups, and if you can get to the final mob you can have ranger WS or
Furious while the pet just hoses the boss.

The other options i've been looking at.. is to go traditional but use
the other aspects of my character to offset the damage being output.
Defensive is up every 10 minutes for 3 minutes.. so if you had high
dps you could try to sprint your way through sets of mobs using druid
+ cleric healing. When Defensive isn't up... either a bard can slow on
on inc or /shield the slower, have a slower slow on inc, and then
either peel it off with taunt + incite, or use Area Taunt to just yank
the agro if its up. /shield is up every 3 minutes with a 12 second
base on up to 48 seconds total with AA. Area Taunt has 15 minute
reuse, but comes down to like 10.5 with AA. If defensiving every time
it bloody comes up, it actually makes you take another look at the
Enduarance Regen in the GoD AA. But.. I know I can tank Tipt straight
up.. its just going to take skill and group coordination to make it
happen. Simply hitting Auto Attack and holding agro is a great TL to
bind.. but not much more.

I'm sure with full sets of GoD gear... these things become trivial...
20% sheilding.. 10-11k unbuffed, and what not, but for now its where
the challenge is for me in EQ and i'm having a blast trying to face it
having just gotten back in game.
