If people had looked at the Paladins of Norrath site as well they might have
found it wasn't as bad as others think.  But there seems to be this
mentality that whenever Paladins get a new spell/ability that makes them
useful at raids every other class cries 'NERF!'.  It was reported that a
silenced mob was still able to CHeal.  And as for Uber Mobs?  Why not?  Why
can't it be that Paladins are the ones who get a skill that might finally
make Kerafyrm beatable?  After all it was always Knights who were the dragon
slayers in traditional fantasy.  And as for silencing roars?  Think about
it - Roar and SILENCE?

This spell meant that now a guild could have a good use for having a Paladin
on a raid.  Whereas before and to some degree with this nerf they are still
expendable for other classes.  Why don't they nerf it so warriors and
clerics are as expendable?  Why shouldn't every class have a equal chance of
be as useful as every other on a raid, to the point where if it came down to
a choice between them it would be based entirely on situational tactics and
current makeup of the raid party.
