Just a quick up date:

I installed the latest Nvidia drivers dated December 9th, and you guys were
right. That fixed it. My previous drivers were only a couple of months or so
old. It still amazes me after all these years of gaming that a company like
Nvidia constantly tweaks their drivers and that it DOES make a difference,
even on older games.

Thanks again all for making me wake up and update again.
