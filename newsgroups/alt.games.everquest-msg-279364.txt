LDoN is old, so not many people still do it.  DoN is new, lots of people 
do DoN missions, and, the equipment and augments are better, and much 
faster to get than they were in LDoN.  You do not need full groups to do 
DoN missions.  You will likely get bored to tears doing the same DoN 
missions over and over.  It also gets boring doing the same raids over 
and over to get the drops from raids.
