Level 65.  You can most easilly kill the highest level mobs, yielding the 
most xp.  Given that the amount of xp needed to gain an AA is constant, 
that means the more xp over time you can get the better for gaining AAs.  
Also, at level 65, death is not as much of a concern, as even with just a 
few blues into the level, rezzed deaths will keep you at level 65 for 
quite some time.
