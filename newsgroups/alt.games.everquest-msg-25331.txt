[alot of stuff given the ole snip]

This can be a touchy subject to a lot of people.  Though, regardless of the
fact that I will probably get flamed to all unholy hell, here goes:

"Need before greed."  Who has this right anyway?  Who has the right to
decide who -NEEDS- something more than the next guy/girl?  It took the group
as a collective to conquer the mob that dropped this item, therefore; all
should roll on it.  What if you are in a zone where the majority of items
that are dropping are melee friendly?  Would you suggest that all the
casters move to a zone that has more caster friendly drops?  Wouldnt that
just about decide what classes you could find where?

The game isn't all about money to me, however, everyone must realize there
is an economy within EverQuest (not just realize but truly understand just
how much it exists in the game thanks to VI and many players).  Just about
everything can be sold, everything.  Say a Cone of Mystics drops (despite it
being ALL/ALL at last check) should only the casters roll?  I dont really
think so.  Thats 1k that is being rolled on (on my server anyway).  Who am I
to say who "needs" 1k in the group?  Seems a bit arrogant to me.  Just think
that if everything were lotto'd, just how many more people would actually
have a little bit of cash in their pockets.

Then there is the rule that Cleric's get all common gems that drop.  Common
gem drops aren't too shabby in most high level places.  Cleric casts a spell
on the tanks of the group (say 4 tanks) which consumes mana and one peridot
each person.  Peridots go for 9-13pp each.  Star Sapphire, Fire Emerald, etc
dropping that are considered "common gems" go for an easy 100pp each.
Clerics shield that was casted lasts about 1 hour, so thats say 72pp spent
for one hours worth of buffs.  Say five "common gems" drop within that one
hour.  Thats about 400-500pp worth of gems.  The Cleric now has more than
what he arrived with, while no chance was given to others to roll.  Is this
fair?  Dunno, I have a high level Cleric which will tell you this is a nice
(since I make out like a dog), but it sucks for the next guy thats level 50+
and his equipment totals -maybe- 5k on a good day.  I find myself /randoming
and alpha splitting extra "common drops" once I have collected 2 hours worth
of peridot cost replacements, then after 2 hours I started collecting these
"common gems" once again.

<shrug>  I suppose I just dont see why things are made so complex.  If
everyone viewed everything dropped (of course only those non-NO DROP items)
as money (ie being sold, traded, etc) and everything was lotto'd, I believe
everyone would benefit.
