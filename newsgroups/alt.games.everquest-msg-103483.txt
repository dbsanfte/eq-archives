Fighting "til death" does not make sense.  The higher level you
attain, the more you will come to regret dying when you could have
lived.  At 24, the experience hit from death is not that bad; but at
54, it sucks bigtime.  Sometimes "Run away!  Run away!" is indeed the
best policy.

There are always more mobs.  The worst thing you can do is subscribe
to some sort of macho "I won't run" philosophy.  This is not to say
that there aren't opportunities for heroism in EQ; there certainly
are.  But to make *every* battle a sort of Custer's Last Stand is not,
IMO, playing the game intelligently.

Now, bailing whenever there is more than one mob and with his having
just enough mana for a gate (especially with an enchanter in the
party) does seem a bit....cautious.

However different people have different thresholds for unacceptable
danger.  His doesn't seem *totally* out of line to me, although I
might play it a bit differently.
