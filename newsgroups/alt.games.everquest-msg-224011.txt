: It's only an exploit if you are doing it in order to bypass parts of the
: quest.  Doing it multiple times because it had been reported in the past
: that sometimes your faction is not high enough after having completed all
: of the steps in order is a work around to a bug.  Doing it more than once
: due to losing the NO RENT gem is not an exploit either.
:
: Plausible reason for redoing Woe and Envy would be you go LD for over 30
: minutes and lose the NO RENT gem that you need to turn in to a wisp in
: EJ.  Also you may just not have realized it is NO RENT, and camped
: between steps.  Only way to get this gem back is to turn in Woe and Envy
: again as I understand it.  SOE made it so that this particular step is
: one you may be forced to repeat due to circumstances beyond your control,
: and yet, now they are saying that if you do repeat it, you will be unable
: to finish the quest.

The way I read it, he killed Glaron and did the Woe/Envy portion and the Gem
turn-in multiple times (I know that he did not say that specifically, but
that is the way I read it because the faction hit comes after the gem
turn-in).  Yes, if the problem was with a No Rent LD/camp/crash, then there
should be no penalty.  My observation is based on his admitting that he was
exploiting a known faction "bug".
