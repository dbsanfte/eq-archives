All true,but on SolRo Dulak has become the new Dreadlands,
only zone where you can find a pickup group any time of day.
Even true newbies can be found there,had a Ranger in a group
equipped with 2 Zaxthril(sp?) forged maces,36/9,asking him if
he uses them for training he said no,I wonder how he made
45 with equipment like this,aditionally I found some melees
there in their fourties without haste item,find this interesting,
much more entertaining than any raid.  :)

After Dulak I spent a lot of time in Nadox,very nice zone,
no need to camp,lots of named spawns with semi decent loot,
once I managed to convince a Ldon group heading to Nadox
instead of doing the 387th BB adventure,man was it fun,one
of the best times ever I had in EQ.All the comments about the
zone in to Nadox from the people who didnt know it,was
worth it. :)
