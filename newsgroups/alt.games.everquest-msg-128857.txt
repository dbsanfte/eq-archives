Yes, most definately.  I only ever grouped with one pulling enchanter, but
he was pretty amazing at always having at least one mob parked and ready to
be killed.  This was in DL as well.  I do play with several enchanters who
are very amazing to see in action, but generally in places where they are
far to busy with crowd control to be the puller.
