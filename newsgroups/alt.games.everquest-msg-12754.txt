I was hunting over in Frontier Mountans and saw a lone giant. I was
new to the area and happened to see that he coned blue to me. I'm a
lvl 29 Ranger with SOW potions (only 1 more level till I get SoW!!!)
so I figure what the hell??? I was quite nervous attacking something
that huge by myself, but I kept the ignite spells flying and soon the
giant fell giving me 8 plat and a Hammer of Flattening. I think I'm
gonna like this place!
