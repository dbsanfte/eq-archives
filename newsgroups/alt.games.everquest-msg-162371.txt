First of all, don't look at how much damage you're hitting for alone.
That's NOT an idication of whether or not your weapons suck. Look at
the damage/delay ration on your weapons. THAT is where you see whether
your weapons "suck". If it's slower than 4 delay per 1 damage, then,
yes, they do suck. Slower than 3:1, they're passable.

As for good HTH weapons that cost 25pp or less, you're not going to
find any player-sold. Best chance is the off chance someone sold one
to a merchant and the merchant has a low resell price.
