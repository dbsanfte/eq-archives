I hate boats.

I remember one time I was making the trip from Freeport to Butcherblock (pre
luclin) and I waited at the dock for at least 20 minutes.  I was on the boat
and about 3-5 minutes from BB when my husband asked me to do something for
him.  I told him to watch the computer for me and to make sure I got off the
boat when it stopped.  Well you guessed it.  He didn't do it and I ended up
sailing all the way back to Freeport.  Boy was I steamed.  A whole hour of
doing nothing!  BLEH
