I'm not saying they never knew something was wrong.  I am saying they never
knew they were about to die.  The last transmission from the shuttle was
totally calm and businesslike and gave no indication they thought they were
about to break up.  What I did mean was that once the thing did begin to
break up, they would have been dead faster than they could have felt the
pain.  I am a bit surprised you could not grasp that that was my meaning.

As for the helmet being charred from the inside out, I don't know what you
think that proves, but it does not prove that the astronaut wasn't dead
before his or her helmet was burned.  The force of wind broke the shuttle
into many pieces, so how do you think this force would not have broken the
astronauts' bodies as quickly?  Did the bodies get burned badly?  Of course
they did.  But they were dead already.  I cannot imagine what you think you
saw in that picture of the burned helmet that convinces you otherwise.
