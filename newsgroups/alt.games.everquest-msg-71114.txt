Well, I was finally able to set up an account, no thanks to the 
"billing address (on card)" instruction.  After what seemed like 
an eternity of downloads and patches, I got to go in to play.

And what a blast!  It took a lot of effort, especially with the 
new expansion coming out.  (Is my timing good, or what?)

Anyway, here are some first impressions:

1.  Low level balance

There seem to be plenty of low-level creatures available to build 
up new characters, especially when soloing.  I imagine as I 
progress to more difficult opponents, grouping will become a 
necessity.

2.  Disconnects

Sometimes frequent, sometimes none at all.  I assume that the new 
expansion has something to do with it and things will get 
smoothed out in time.  Otherwise, I'm afraid to venture too far 
from Kelethin. My biggest fear is that I'll die and won't be able 
to find and loot my corpse.

3.  Graphics

The game graphics are pretty good, but I haven't figured out how 
to get a full screen.  Right now, I'm using about 6x8 inches on 
my 17 inch monitor.

4.  Tutorial

Nowhere to be found.  It would be nice to set up hot keys and 
stuff offline.

5.  Character creation

I like the rotating screen.

Oh well, got to run.  See you on the Tholuxe Paells server 
(thanks, Joolz).
