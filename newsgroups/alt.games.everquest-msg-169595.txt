One of the big problems in EQ is that your computer still processes a
lot of video info even if you can't see anyone.  That's the reason why
you get lag like crazy dealing with the merchants in the bazaar - your
machine is still rendering the 50 traders behind the wall.  The only
true solution is turning of models.  If you see the screenshots from
the uber guilds raiding with 50 + characters - they always run the
standard pre-luclin graphics.
My machine with a GF4Ti46000 still lagged in the bazaar, till I turned
off most common models.  Now I can polka in the bazaar with clip plane
at max, and not drop a frame.
