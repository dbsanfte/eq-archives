No, that's while soloing.  I cast a lot while soloing, being as my melee 
output is negligable compared to my DPS from casting.  Clerics are 
different with regards to having the summoned proccing hammer, although I 
had heard they nerfed the proc rate significantly.  I buff up my pet for 
dps output, toss a proc on him, slow and DoT the heck out of the mob, 
then sit around medding, canning, and healing while the mob beats on me.  
With the added 18 mana per tick from medding, it makes a noticable 
difference in the rate at which I can go through mobs.
