Your opinion carries very little weight with me biz, and I'm sure the 
feeling is mutual.  However, I don't make it a point to prove to all and 
sundry that after playing the game for three years, I don't know my ass 
from my elbow.  We know you're a misanthrop, but we never took you for an 
idiot.  I guess you sure showed us.
Of course I doubt you will find a single poster here who thinks your way 
of warning people is acceptable.  Maybe you really should go back to 
single-player games if you can't get along with your fellow players.

No, not at all.  I assumed that you have decent knowledge of the game 
mechanics, especially since you claim to be an expert on just about 
everything.  Now when you post something that indicates that you either 
have no clue, or that you willfully dump your trains on other people, I 
think it's perfectly acceptable to call you on it.  The best part is that 
you're a druid, so you should have a decent head start on the mobs, so 
just zone would cause the least amount of trouble.  But nooooo, you 
couldn't do that, you have to fuck over everyone sitting near the zone 
line, because you disapprove of sitting on the tracks.  (Where would you 
propose that people hunting in WW group and buff?)  
So what is it biz, asshole or idiot?  Or did I misinterpret what you're 
saying?  I really do want to see how you justify your action on this one.
