<Translation>
"Hey! I was in Stone Brunt on a corpse retrieval. I had died because I tried
to root a named mob and it did not work, didn't try to gate and was dead in
less than 30 seconds. So, I was looking for my body, this time, when I got
in trouble I gated, with only 148hp's left. I'd have taken one more hit off
the mob before I was dead, I love gate =) I have it mem'd at all times now,
next to root"
