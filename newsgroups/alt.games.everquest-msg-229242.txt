Most nights since hitting 56 I've set up in trader mode, filling all the 
spare slots in my bags with muzzles.  I have them priced at 4pp, which 
is as cheap as I've seen them, and I've yet to log back on and find 
someone undercutting me.  I rarely log back in and find myself sold out, 
either.

I make, from the muzzles, about 24pp a night.

Funny thing is, I often log out with a relatively fresh KEI on, and I 
pay 25pp a cast for KEI.

Loser!

Well, it makes more sense then you'd think, since I also average about a 
Kpp a night in other goods sold; I figure the muzzle sales make up for 
the lost KEI and encourage me to actually set up in trader mode, which I 
did only once every week or two prior to getting the muzzle spell.

And perhaps when I hit my 60s the money will get better; I know I've 
paid higher for muzzles when the person selling them also had Fist of 
Ixiblat or Blade of W. and maybe a belt; getting a full kit was handier 
than running around.

And of course I'd buy several of each, two weapons per pet, belt per pet 
in addition to muzzle per pet, could easily add up to 20 or 30pp per 
pet, instead of the 4pp per pet I'm earning selling just muzzles.

Any way you cut it its not going to be the fortune KEI seems to be... 
but then again, I get to make it while AFK, just summon to fill, then 
off I go for the night.

Even now, making money off my mana while you sit here just reading.
