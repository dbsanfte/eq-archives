Hehehe, our guild occasionally used to do a drunk monk challenge....this
consisited of making a level 1 monk character, going to Kith entrance,
getting beer from the guildy organising the event, drinking substantial
quantities and then making the run on the path.....despite all this more
than one person made it I am told.

I definitely sit there and wait for daylight myself but i think that
simply because I hit track and th eplace ights up red.
