I would LOVE to see in EQ a restriction on the auction command. To help
build more of a community, I would love to see it being restricted to zones
with a market place. Like freeport. So if someone wanted to do a /auction
they have to be in the freeport market to do it. This would make a real
collective point for people to go 'shopping so to speak.
One of the most popular places for people to yell auction is the EC Tunnel.
So again that could be made a market area, where the 3 traders are already.

Another thing would be to make the language roll playing across all servers,
why? Again to add that extra bit work to make the game a little bit more
roll play without making in die hard.

TLC - I dislike the way it was done because I play Solo a lot. Not because I
wish too but because I live in the UK. And when I am on its hard to find a
group.
But I do wish they would put some limit on looting like if your over a level
the items you loot that would be of no use but to sell would become no drop
for them. IE if you needed the loot for yourself great, that might stop
farming.

Oh and id love to see a spam killer, like yahoo messenger has, puts a limit
on the number of msgs you can send in a specified time.
So no more newbies shouting 'SoW need for corpse run' 30 times per min. This
would only need to be set for /shout /auction etc. Normal type need not be
affected.

Notice boards, there are notice bored in EQ ya know! Yea true, but most
people don't know it. Why not put the notice boards at the entrance to the
cities, you could have official notices, and the player notices. All the
notice boards could be linked by magic so posting one notice on any board
would appear on them all. To stop people spaming on them or just being
silly, put a charge on posting like 2gp. Low enough for a newbie to post but
high enough to stop a newbie spaming.

Corpse Zone - I don't know if this is already possible. But can you tell
easily what zone your corpse is in? Not where it is in the Zone but what
zone ie - EC Zone. Why? Well for example I like to explore a lot, I tend to
wander round zones just so I know what is where etc etc. I also use invis
and go deep into zones I really shouldn't. And get killed a lot for doing
that. Thats all fair, tiss my own fault.
But one day I did one of these expeditions, and had to log before I could go
and get my corpse. Now when I did relog a few days later, I could not for
the life remember what zone I died in!

Another gripe is the rare quest items, ok it fair to make a quest hard. For
example the Hafling Skin quest where you have to get bear skin, shark skin,
polar bear skin and a gator skin. OK not hard huh, within 1hr I had all
skins bar the Gator skin. 3 months! Later and 1000 or so bull gator deaths
no gator skin. Its so silly, why not just make all the quest items harder to
get but not just one so rare it just never spawns unless your luckier than a
lottery winner.

Well just a few thoughts, I have plenty of other wish lists ;)
