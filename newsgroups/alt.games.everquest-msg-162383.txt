Count me in as one of the suckers that bought this POS.  "Oh great, I won't
need to dig through my piles of printed maps anymore."  Bzzzt wrong.  The
maps are too small, lots of errors, and no /loc numbers.  I've thumbed
through it in a the bathroom a few times, but so far I've used it exactly
zero times while playing EQ.
My advice to anyone who hasn't got this and is thinking of buying it:
DON'T!!!
