1. Do I have to forge the shield myself, or do I get the completed shield for
turning in the combined frame with the bloodling carapaces in it?

2. Is there any way to get a shield like the guards carry, or is it a
guard-exclusive shield?

3. Is there a way to make the No Rent armor that Magicians can summon
permanent, like the way Shaded armor is made?
