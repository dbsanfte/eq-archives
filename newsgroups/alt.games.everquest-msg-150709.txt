Bull. My kids would occasionally scream "I wish I were dead" long
before they were old enough to possibly have any real problems to
worry about beyond whether they should watch Sponge Bob or Johnny
Bravo. It was usually because they were made to clean their room
before going outside to play or some such nonsense. What they *did*
have was a propensity for temper tantrums. I try to avoid spoiling my
kids, but it's a fine line between giving them what you never had and
spoiling them. Some parents don't walk that line too well.

I'll not cater to every spoiled kid I come across. Sure they're crying
out for something, but in most cases it's with purely idle threats. A
person who is going to kill themself will not typically alert the
world. Their mind will be made up and telling everyone would only
create the potential for someone to interfere.

Oh, and for the record, kids should be prevented at all costs from
committing suicide. Adults? They're old enough to make up their own
minds.
