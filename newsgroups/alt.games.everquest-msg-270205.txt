I cancelled my EQ2 subscription.  Since it was on 3 month billing and this
was 2 days after the free month ran out, my account will still work for a
while, so I'll probably play now and then and see if it gets better, but for
now, my plans are WoW for a while, and I'll also pick up the new DAoC
expansion soon.  I'm willing to maintain two MMORPG subscriptions, and I
think those will be WoW and DAoC.

My problem with EQ2 is that it just doesn't feel like an MMORPG to me.  The
combination of locked encounters and not being able to even buff people
outside the group makes it so you have most of the disadvantages that some
have pointed out with instances (hi Ben!), without the advantages.  It's
basically a shared instance--a concept that hurts my brain. :-)

In EQ1 or DAoC, if I am fighting somewhere or passing through an area, and
see other players, we can affect each other.  We have to worry about not
training each other, not aggroing each others mobs, and stuff like that.  In
EQ2, the main affect of other players in the same area is to reduce the
number of mobs available.

I also dislike what happens when you break a locked encounter.  Breaking it
makes it so no one gets XP or quest credit for it.  So, once someone not in
my group engages a mob, if they get in trouble, there is no way for them to
ask us for help with the encounter.  All they can do is break the encounter
and ask for help in not dying.  Basically, you can only get help to avoid
losing a fight--you can't get help to win a fight, unless you arrange for
that help before the fight starts.

Then there is the way grouped mobs work.  I've got a quest to kill 40
gnolls.  If I go out and find a group of three gnolls, engage them, kill
two, and then decide that I am not going to be able to beat the third, and
run away--no XP and no quest credit for the two I've killed.  I could kill
5000 gnolls and not complete my "kill 40" quest, just because I didn't kill
them in the way the game wants me to.  I'd not mind this so much if they'd
have made it make sense...e.g., if the quest was to loot 40 gnoll scalps or
something like that...then killing a couple and running would clearly not
satisfy the quest requirements.

I'm also not pleased with the solo content.  I mostly play MMORPGs either
solo or with a small group of RL friends.  Soloing has gotten rather slow
for my Druid at level 13.  Most of my quests are either green (and give very
little XP) or involve groups of 5 or 6 blue mobs or groups of 3 double
up-arrow blue mobs.  Advancing by old fashioned killing, rather than quests,
requires an ungodly number of kills (it feels like EQ1 did in the 50's).

It's basically a single-player game, except they replaced the single player
with a single group.
