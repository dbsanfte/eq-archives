There arnt a lot of other options for easy pickup groups unfortunately. I
spent a couple of levels in HHP with my chanter at about level 17, and the
quality of the players was way above what was in Oasis. Maybe I was just
lucky. I think its a pity that BW isnt a good pickup zone, because its a
relatively safe zone to travel through, and single pulling is trivial. I
guess its probably all those treeas killing proples framerates.
