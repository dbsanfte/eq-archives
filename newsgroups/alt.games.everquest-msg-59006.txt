  I'm a little curious myself as to the supposed benefit of having higher
agility.  When I create my shadow knight tomorrow (erudite) I'm probably
going to dump all the points I can in to strength, though I'm debating with
myself about where to put the rest... dexterity, stamina, or agility?  I've
heard that you should get your agility at or above 75 to reach some sort of
threshhold, but I can't remember anybody saying exactly what reaching that
threshhold does for you.

> Trivia:  What is the single highest AC item in the game?

  Strangely enough, according to my impromptu and not-very-exhaustive
research (I used EQprices.com)... it's actually a weapon called the
Palladius Axe of Slaughter.  It's a really uber item found in the Temple of
Veeshan, apparently, and boosts AC by a whopping 80 points, in addition to
boosting all the physical stats by +25 and all resists by +10... plus boosts
HP by 100.  Heh.
