RP does infact exist on many different servers at many different levels.
As to if it "flourashes" or not is a matter of opinion.  I would
suggest going to EQRoleplayers.com and looking at the info there. 
There is a guild listing of all known RP guilds on all of the servers
grouped by alignment.  I know we have several RP guilds on EMarr that
are doing very well besides my own.

Good Luck.
