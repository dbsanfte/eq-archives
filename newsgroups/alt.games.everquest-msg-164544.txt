So a warrior with a 100/10 weapon and a monk with a 10/100 weapon fighting
side-by-side, the monk will outdamage the warrior?

Of course there's logic in saying that a warrior with a better weapon can
put out more DPS than a monk.  Figuring out how much better a weapon has to
be to achieve that is all in the parsing.  I will say, I have ST weapons,
and my best 2h weapon is a 45/44.  I positively don't have the ability to
*buy* a better weapon, at any price (and price doesn't matter to me in the
slightest).

Drop rate nerfed or not, 60k, 100k, whatever.  There is no monk equivalent
to windblade.  I'll add "yet" to that, as maybe one of the last tier zones
that hasn't been touched yet will drop 60/44 monk 2hb weapons like candy.
