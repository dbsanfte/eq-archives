They may spawn in the same location as a node for a resource but they
do not share nodes with resources. If you can harvest a resources from
a shrub, root, shroom, log or mineral you will never get a collectable
from that node. When you deplete that node and something else spawns
in that location it may indeed be a collectable but you will not get a
resource from a question mark or a collectable from a resource node.

When I talked in game with a QA rep we both called what resources were
harvested from resource nodes. I was asking about the latest patch on
test that had resource nodes not being depleted by an unsucessful
attempt. You will always get thre items from a node no matter how many
tries it takes. Not sure when that will hit live but it's been real
nice on harvesting. Skillups in harvesting have really been increased
too. 

One node gave me 8 skillups because I kept getting nothing on several
tries :-)
