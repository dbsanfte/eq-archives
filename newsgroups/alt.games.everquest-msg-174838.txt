I had heard PoN was a decent outdoor zone, so I thought I would try it out
with my 56 druid. I got one of the werewolf guys down to about 1 bub of
health with Root/DoT only to have root break. I moved back a bit, (but not
too far) and reapplied root.

Imagine my surprise when he his healthbar went UP after the root damage.

The only thing I can think of is he "lost sight" of me and his regen kicked
in. He was not a caster, nor was there a 'friendly' mob helping him out

Has this happened to anyone else?
