If he can keep his posting down to say one a week, then I'm not sure this is
really a problem for me.

He's not doing anything illegal or in violation of the eula.

He's offering a service which will require time and energy on his part, plus
special tools that he's worked to attain (or purchased on EBay, but that would
be illegal/violation)

While most states in the USA do have laws against prostitution, I don't see
anything inherantly wrong with him whoring himself out in this way, nor in the
somewhat tawdry fact that some people haven't got a single friend willing and
able to powerlevel them thru the lowest, easiest levels in the game.

Frankly, if he can make good money at it, heck, I'll quit my job and put out a
shingle myself!

Hmm, sad to say a 65 cleric and 53 bard aren't really all that good at
powerleveling, give me that 55 druid for the job anyday.  I suppose women who
aren't build like Rachel Welch must feel the same about their prospects in the
skin trade.
