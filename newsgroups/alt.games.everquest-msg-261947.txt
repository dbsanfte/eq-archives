Hm. I don't think there are many posters here who hold the current US 
administration in more contempt than I do, but honestly, I think that 
the fact that Bush II is the son of Bush I is neither here nor there. 
The ancient political clans of both the Republican and Democratic 
parties are so closed and so established that two generations of 
presidents in the same family was just a question of time. Hell, if 
circumstances had been different, it could have been a Kennedy and not a 
Bush.
