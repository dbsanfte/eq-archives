I got mine from the Crystalline Sharwurms in GD. Go tto the SOUTH cave
entrance, take the 1st rioght & go to the 2nd cave to the right. There
will be 4 Crystal Shardwurms. They eventually drop every classes 50
level spells. In 3 hours, the Camo only dropped once, while others
dropped multiple times.
