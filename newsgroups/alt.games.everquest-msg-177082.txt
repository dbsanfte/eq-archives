I admit to being new to Everquest and still having a lot to learn, but
I've just got to grips with the map of Antonica, and how it connects
to Odus and Faydwer, and how all the zones in Antonica connect
together. However the one thing I'm confused about now, as I only have
the first EQ, and none of the expansions, is how does Antonica connect
to all the other zones (when I get the add-ons that is)? I haven't
seen any listings on the maps of ways in which the different
continents connect.
