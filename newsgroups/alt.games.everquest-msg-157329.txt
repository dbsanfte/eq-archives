I've seen quite a few of those logs and I dare say that either you're 
talking about logs with the pre-nerf hammer that actually did any damage 
or you're comparing a cleric with very high end gear (like the level 60 
hammer, 4x% haste etc) to some 54 pally with a sword that drops in 
chardok. The DPS I see with my gimp gear and the nerfed level 56 hammer 
is not all that. Sure I can get a lucky run with procs and do decent 
damage but if I do it's just that, luck..
