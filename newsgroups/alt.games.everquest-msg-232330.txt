Caveat - I play on FV augs are droppable.

Master looter is the only way to go. Rotation is too long and someone needs
to keep track of it. I already have trouble with groups going to dang slow.
I only worry about getting hosed on loot if I am playing the cleric when
everyone needs a spell that costs a peri to cast. (Yes I know some people
think this is the cleric's job to supply these, I do not happen to be one of
those - I already donated for KEI, I bought gear same as the people that use
that argument)

In my groups we use the following.
ML - loots everything (if there were NO DROP items they would be rolled as
the appear)
Trade skill items are sold to anyone in the group for the vendor cost (sure
they are cheap most of the time, but too many times the person who was going
to "use" the items has em for sale that night on a vendor - another nice
thing about FV much easier to determine this happened) BEFORE the split or
they are sold to the vendor.
At the end 1 random roll with highest to lowest choosing what they want from
the augs/named drops. No NBG (you don't ever have to take something), no 5
rolls etc. Works out nice and fast to move on to next adventure, RL, etc.
All spell reagents paid back that were over 1g in cost (arbitrary, but at
level 20+ should be fine and is usually just peris, but offered for anything
that falls into this range)
Split to the group
