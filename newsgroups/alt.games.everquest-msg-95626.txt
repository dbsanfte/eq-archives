Beggars are like idiots...  They don't read.  I know one guy who kept
harassing people, was part of a guild I was in.  I kept telling him not to
do it, then he insults me for telling him not to do it.  After a while, he
starts insulting other players in the guild to get himself promptly kicked
out of the guild.

Personally, I hate beggars.  I do like what some people do, like High Level
Mages giving them mod rods and telling them they get XP if they right Click
on it.

Another good example of stupidity...  a level 1 Warrior putting on Ulthork
Tunic... Then wondering why he keeps going unconcious wearing it.
