Indocolite, rune etched, and (until recently) bard armor (I don't even know
the name of the stuff, it was so rare, and I haven't been on a hate raid in
a long, long time) are by far the rarest armor drops up there. Seems like
you have gotten a bit less than normal, but not too far out of whack.

With my shaman, it took 5 raids before a single piece of rune etched
dropped at all.

Contrast with cleric armor, where on a single raid we had 4 breastplate (3
rotted), 2 legs (1 rotted), 5 helms (all rotted), 4 bracers (2 rotted) and
a pair of gloves (rotted) drop. It was disgusting.
