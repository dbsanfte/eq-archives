That's what I'll do then once I have everything squared away. Both
systems now have EQ installed and connected to the 'Net so I will just
have to get another copy of Gold to get the CD key. I think I also
need another video card. The new system came with a onboard video chip
(S3 Savage or something like that) and when I log in all the
characters look funny. I can see through the armor to the clothing
underneath, and the outer layers are fragmented. Same with hair,
facial features, etc. Any fix for this?
