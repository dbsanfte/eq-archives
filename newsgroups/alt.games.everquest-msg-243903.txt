You assume I did it specifically to annoy people? Well, you're quite
simply quite wrong. I really don't have a habit of instigating. I don't
see why you would think I'm doing so now.

Well, since you refuse to even see past your own short tempered fumings
on the subject, I'll drop it right here. I honestly don't understand why
it is that when you feel a topic has been debated to death and you feel
you have a steadfast opinion, that no one else should say another word
about it in your mind. Get over yourself. 

No one is goading anyone here except for those of you who for some
reason are taking such offense and imagining some sort of antagonism.
You look for it. You pick fights. Guess what? It is entirely possible to
discuss without debate. No one has to win. No one has to be crowned king
of the conversation. That's all I was out for in this instance. 

Nevermind. You win. King Ben rules usenet, blah, blah. Happy?
