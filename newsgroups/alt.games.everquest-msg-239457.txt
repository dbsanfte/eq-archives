No, it is not too coincidental.  It is still me, Mike Vance.  After I 
gave away my first account I struggled with my EQ obsession and gave in 
and bought it again, then worked up my halfling warrior to level 11, 
then I said "no more!" and promptly gave away the second account.  I 
have not given up not on EQ, but on giving away accounts, because I went 
and bought a new copy again.

Therapists are too expensive so I figure I will just level a character 
up to 65 since it is the only way to stop this madness.  I hate the 
time-suck that EQ is but I find it too compelling to resist any further.

I changed my posting name because of embarrassment.

And no, I am not giving away anymore accounts.
