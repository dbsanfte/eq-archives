Nope. 

The  biggest reason for EQ's subscription numbers is no competition, 
which over time ends up being even as good as EQ is, while people are
starved for MMORPGS. A LOT of people "left" (1/3 of my entire large
guild) for DAOC but it did not have the staying power of EQ and they
are back in EQ now.

This is a bit like a small town where the only restaurant is burger
king  and some horrible health club violation bar with poor food and
if you said that the burger king there was successful because it is a
burger king.

I myself have left EQ for about 4 times in 3 and a half years. It
doesn't have great longevity, it stagnates, it is not random enough
but rather very static virtually all of the time. The thing is it is
evidently very hard to get the MMORPG right. Several companies have
now tried and none have captured the wide playing audience that EQ has
and to a large degree held.
diminish

If someone makes a real overall "better" mmorpg than EQ, it(EQ) will
diminish over time. So far no one has done that. For some odd reason
I'm betting on Verant with star wars galaxies. They have probably
learned the most about doing an mmorpg right this time and are very 
aware of the design mistakes in EQ (though they don't usually refer to
them as "design mistakes" because that would make it sound like they
should be fixed.)
