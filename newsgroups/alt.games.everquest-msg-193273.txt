It was.  =)

OMG, I thought I was the only one!  =)  Everyone rants and raves about this
game, but I just never found it compelling.  The human campaign I found
mildly entertaining, but it went downhill from there and I found myself
caring nothing at all for what happened to the night elves.  And while the
graphics were very, very cool, the gameplay itself didn't seem any different
from WCII.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when you throw in an
uninteresting plot on top of that, I found myself just not able to get
excited about WC3 at all.
