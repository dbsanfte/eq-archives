There is a macro, although its really more of a DirectX modification, it
just keeps hitting the key over and over, useful to raise sense heading,
mend, sense traps, pick locks and any other skills where all you have to do
is keep hitting the button ( archery if you don't have to keep running from
something ).

Although, like anything else like this, be warned, IF VI catches you, they
will most likely ban you, however, in this particular case, without running
an illegal and highly unpopular system scan on you, or you being an idiot
and shouting about it ingame, they will not be able to detect it, it is just
like you had a little machine sitting on your keyboard hitting the hotkey
every 3 seconds or whatever.
