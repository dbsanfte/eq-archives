A Horadric Cube is in Diablo II. he was making a joke. In the game you yurn
crappy gems into better gems.

The ones in EQ are dropped by Genoids in Velious. Some of them have small
magic properties which can be held in melee slot but not worth it really.
Generally you sell them to vendors for a tidy sum of plat. Not tried using
one in jewelcraft but I am sure I'll gert the cannot combine messgae
