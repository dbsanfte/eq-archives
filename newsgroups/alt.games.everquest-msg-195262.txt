Think that's normal.  Of course the skeletons usually attack me, not
what I'm attacking.  I used to have loads of fun getting sarnaks and
goblins to kill each other off in LOIO.  Charm one, have it attack the
other.  Charm wears off, they continue beating on each other instead of
comming after me.  Fun!

No, the new one is over the bridge, just on the way to the commonlands,
turn left and you should see him. I trade with him fine.  The guy you
are talking about isn't a merchant I believe.
