Not trying to be insensitive... (well actually yeah I am) ... I think you're
looking for a game that will give you everything you want without you having
to do any work.  That description fits exactly 0 games out there, at least 0
games worth playing.  Good luck finding a game where nothing is hard to do
or to find, and do you know why?  Because the attraction of a game, to a
very large extent, is in the challenge of it.  Anyone who was dumb enough to
make a game with no challenge would make no money.  I would say GL with
whatever game you decide to play, except that I predict you'll try, say,
DAoC, UO, AO, E&B, etc., etc., etc., and when you're done you'll cry about
how all those games are mean because they didn't give you what you wanted
when you wanted it without you having to do anything to get it... you'll
probably end up playing Solitaire... oh wait, Solitaire is challenging
too...
