Subject: Those Velious pirates don't like wolves, eh?

Up until today my level 30 druid hadn't died since he was about 12th level. 
Then I went to Velious.  In wolf form.  Which is, I now know, bad.

I ran out of ice to run on before I outran the guards and they got me in the
water after I tumbled over the edge of an ice berg.

I just had to laugh.  Danger, learning curve ahead.

Oh well, off to search for the corpse.


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
