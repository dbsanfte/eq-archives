Run4:
The description says it will "slightly increase your base run speed".
 I ran race's with friends that had run3 and
no other speed enhancements.  It was constantly a tie.  At no time could I
out distance a run3 player.  "Slightly" is right. It is so slight you can
not tell the difference. I thought that since run3 increases to 30% of base
(with basic, low level SoW at 34%), that maybe I could approach basic SoW.
To make matters worse, the next level (run5) cost 10 aa's. What a waste of 5
aa's and I'm not putting 10 more aa's to see if that will do any better.
