A lot depends on how many people there are.  The EQ client does a lousy job of
updating other players on your screen when there is any height difference,
and if anyone gets any lag, they tend to be drawn going off in a straight
line.

This can make it hell to try to follow a crowd in a place like Kedge.  I was
in the rear with my guild, and the leaders were pausing now and then at
junctions to let everyone catch up.  As people moved into the junction, some
would get a little lag while the happened to be moving in the direction of
one of the side passages, and so to me it would like like the went down
those passages.

If there aren't a lot of people, it's easy to completely lose the ones you
are following if they get a little lag.  If there are a lot of people, it
looks like they are splitting up and going all possible ways at each
junction.
