Umbra was part of the program that worked out whether it render the graphics
or not, i guess the easiest way to explain this is the following

Your character is standing behind a closed door, in normal games it would
still go ahead and render what was in the room, a complete waste of
bandwidth as you not going to see what its rendering.

What Umbra does (or dpvs) is intelligently works out what not to bother
rendering, so if you were standing in front of a closed door, thats all it
would render, not all the contents inside (until you actually go in)


Now, for some reason umbra (dpvs) is screwed, so screwed up it isnt working
correctly at all, and that is why everybody is seeing massive FPS problems,
believed it has something to do with AMD processors not working correctly
with the umbra application, to make sure AMD users could still play they
patched it up really bad, now for some reason if you use the UseUmbra=False,
it just turns the thing off, and frame rates are perfect again, im not sure
how this effects luclin, as i have only been up there a couple of times, and
never with the feature turned off.

However in non-luclin the results are extremely impressive.  I dont think
non-luclin areas were ever changed to be umbra compatiable as that would
mean massive downloads for all playing.

Umbra will eventually get fixed one day, so you can just delete the line
when it does.
