You have to kill Raster who is a Monk to do the quest, or you can kill
Brother Z who is a monk to skip the quest. 

Either way you end up hunting and killing another Monk (actually you
kill 2 Monks to do the quest). 

Camping Raster is trivial at level 45 (the time it takes to camp is
NOT trivial). Killing Brother Z requires at least 2 coordinated groups
of 50+ characters and is not trivial by any means. 

So you can either face the challenge of a long camp, or the challenge
of a high level encounter. Personally I respect any Monk who has the
robe regardless of how they acquired it.

PS I plan on camping Raster myself for a reasonable amount of time. If
that fails I will get some help and hunt Brother Z. EQ is only a game
after all.
