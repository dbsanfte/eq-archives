I have found that - at times, my pet will just start wandering of,
without any apparent reason, in a direction that leads straight away from
me... If I move after it, it will most likely turn and come back...

Also, if you tell pet to guard a place, or sit down, and then you have it
in a fight, and the fight moves out of a certain range from guard-/sitspot,
then pet will just stay at the position where the mob goes down, and not
move
an inch, instead of coming back... :(

Another (bug) thing I have found is that, when you Dominate undead a zombie
or mummy, or ghoul, for that - anyways, all the undead i have tested so
far -
and tell them to /sit down or /guard here, that they will do that, for like
3 to 5 seconds,
and then just stand up and run off...

Must all be some bugs yet to be fixed some day (or not)


Best Regards,
