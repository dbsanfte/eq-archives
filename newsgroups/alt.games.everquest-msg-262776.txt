But it's not even a matter of whether they would do it.  Even if they never 
did it, there would be plenty of opportunity to give the appearance that 
they were doing it, now that they would have financial motive to do so.

Every time someone looted a hill giant and only got 4gp from it, that would 
come to mind.  Every time a named doesn't drop its rare, more valuable item, 
it would come to mind.  Happens plenty of times now, but only the most silly 
folks think it's because SOE's trying to screw them.  That wouldn't be the 
case if they implemented this sort of thing.
