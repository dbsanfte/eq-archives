This might be a stupid question, but what happens if you try to kill a 
vendor?  The reason I ask is because I found some vendors in Shar Vahl that 
con green to me at 35, with no guards nearby.  If I attack the vendor, even 
though it is green to me will it rip me a new one, or will it simply say 
"invalid target" or something like that?  And also (assuming I can fight it 
and I win) will I be able to loot the items it had in inventory, or will 
there be nothing for me to loot...and will there be a really big faction 
hit (right now everything looks at me like an ally.) Sorry if this sounds 
like a stupid question, but I wasn't able to find anything on it using 
google...thanks!
