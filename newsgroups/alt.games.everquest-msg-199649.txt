Just to confirm this, you did the follow up, Moonstone to Mcneal Jacob,
quest?
The gnoll tooth one does nothing to Priests of Life only the Moonstone one
effects them. I assume that if you have screwed PoL faction then your
Knights of Thunder faction is also borked? If not Bandit sashes will raise
both factions faster...but you'll need to be Dubious, at worst, to the
Paladins.

I don't know of any other quests that raise PoL faction without actually
dealing with them, like the Moonstone one does. What level is your
character, you could try killing some of the Blood Saber npcs.
