If you're talking about PPP multilink you need to have your ISP support 
it on their end.

You can't multilink a cable and modem connection. You could bring up 
both connections simultaneously, then either use software to monitor 
both interfaces and change the default route as appropriate, or write a 
script to do this yourself, or do it manually. I'm not aware of any 
software which does this under Windows, although I am sure it does exist.

Managing network interfaces under Windows is a royal pain in the butt, 
but under Win2k at least you have the option to change the default route 
via the command line.

The easiest solution is to simply manually dial up your modem when your 
cable goes down.
