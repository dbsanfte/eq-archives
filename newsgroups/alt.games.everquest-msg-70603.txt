NOTE: this post is not about Dan.  This is just a convenient place to
put this.

I think some people just like worrying about loot distribution.  You
can see this by looking at DAoC.  In DAoC, nothing is NO DROP, and by
default it *automatically* distributes looted items randomly to the
group.  For items that aren't equipment, and so will just be sold to
the vendors for cash, there's no sane reason to worry about them.
Just let them be automatically distributed.  Sure, in a given group at
a given camp, someone will get more than someone else.  However, over
time, it works out...you might end up behind in one group, but you'll
be ahead in another.

Yet, there are people who want to micromanage distribution of
non-equipment items, and keep careful track, and make sure that
everyone has an equal amount after the items are sold to vendors.
Blech.

In fact, a good argument can be made for letting the autoloot system
handle EVERYTHING.  Because nothing is NO DROP, and equipment wears
out and has level limits (so there is always a market for any given
good item, and always a need for cash), my healer, for example, can
get just as much use out of a warrior-only sword as a warrior
can...because I can sell it and use the money for my armor or weapon
needs.  Letting autoloot distribute the sword to me, and then letting
the warrior offer to buy it or trade for it if he really wants it
works out great, and is fair in the long run, and completely gets rid
of the loot hassles of EQ.  Yet, if you go to the DAoC newsgroup, one
of the longest threads concerns an argument over whether or not an
EQ-style NBG looting system should be used.
