The coffins for Lesser Summon Corpse are a little over a plat and can,
apparently, be found in most cities. The bag vending Gypsy in Oasis is the
only place I actually *know* sells them, called a black ceremonial coffin.
This spell works upto level 35.

You and everyone else can summon corpses, just not at a zone wide level.
Type /corpse when close to your corpse (about 20ft in game scale) and you're
corpse will be summoned to your feet. Make a hot key of this then
continually press it while moving and you will "drag" your corpse along with
you. Combine this command with /consent <name> allows someone else to pull a
corpse out of danger, helps when faction or level are an issue.

You were probably already aware of the above but just in case you weren't. A
seemingly unretrievable corpse to you may not be for someone else close by.
