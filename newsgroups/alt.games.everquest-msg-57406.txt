  Nothing at all if thats your guilds aim.  My guilds aim is to go to
planes and do complex high level tasks.  A guild is supposed to be brought
together by a desire to acchieve the same ends.  Therefore every guild
should be a little differetn.  If every guild is the same then all it
becomes is a bunch of little clicques of friends an not really guilds at
all.  This is fine, dont get me wrong.  Some players however wish to go
other ways and guild restrictions help differentiate on guild from another
