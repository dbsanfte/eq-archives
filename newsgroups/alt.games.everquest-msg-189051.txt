considering the sites, ppl have posted excellent sites to wich i only can
fill one more in. www.guildmagic.com to register your toon as you make it
and update it's profile/lvl every now and then. (some guilds require it).
Where it concerns luclin it's an excellent place for lvling beyond 15.
(though there are alternatives on norrath/kunark but none come close to the
paludal caverns) besides that you can use several portals (spires) wich go
roghly to and from the moon every 15 minutes and can port you to other
continents.
Besides that, you can buy things in the bazaar. (it's a place where players
can turn into merchants) furthermore the bazaar provides a searchscreens to
find affordable weapons armor and tradeskill items. Furthermore nexus (on
luclin) is a meeting place to find buffs and where a lot of ppl meet
eachother.

Now pop is trivial, it provides very fast travelling between most cities and
the usages of the planes of knowledge. It will provide you with the
raidfeature wich is usefull once you find yourself a guild. It has a libary
wich contains a lot of spells to reduce search and traveltime for them if
you choose to play a casterclass. And if you like the game you'll want to
buy it for the endgame anyway


Now you can order luclin and later on pop, but you can see what it costs
added together and compare that with the gold edition that includes all. Now
if you can resell the trilogy without the 90 day card, you could get things
cheaper alltogether.

goodluck and enjoy playing
