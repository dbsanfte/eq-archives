I did some research and decided against the Gloves.  They do suck since the
Right-Click buff actually makes your STR go negative for awhile.  The gloves
were selling for 750pp today.  750pp for +25AC gloves is still good I think.
But there are better if you want to spend the money.

But I did buy the Arms today for 1125pp.  Lessor shielding is a nice buff
for a mid 40s warrior.  Also it is stackable with Cleric buffs.
