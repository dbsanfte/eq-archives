Many mages have reported their firepet being eaten by Rak now.
The best way to beat him now is just a 65 tank and DPS.  We
did him with 65 ranger tank, 62 water pet, 55 rogue, the shaman,
64 cleric, 65 druid.  All I did was heal the aoe damage on
my pet, far easier now that I have the 64 heal.  The ae is
fairly infrequent, so it's fairly easy to heal it on top of
the melee damage he does.
