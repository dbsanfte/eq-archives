The Single player campaign kinda sucked but the game engine is nice.
The designers obviously chose ease of modding versus advanced modding
ability when designing it so sometimes you must work around their
design choices but its much easier I hear then the Dungeon siege or
morrowind toolsets are for beginners. I have played several mods and
last week started making my own. I have all the areas laid out now,
just finished designing my first monsters and encounters and am
working on my quests and conversations. 

As for graphics, with my geforce 2 the world was flat and lifeless but
I recently got a geforce 4 and anyone who says EQ's graphics are
better is kidding. NWN's graphics are tiles though and LIMITED
because everything must be part of either a landscape block, or a
placeable item in order to fit into the toolset. There are currently
only about 10 official tile sets. 

I have seen DAOC bindstones, a fugue plane for death, portal systems,
variations on resting and death schemes, a tradeskill system and other
things all done as mods for the game. An expansion is planned and with
the modding community getting more and more experience I see the
potential of this game increasing over time.
