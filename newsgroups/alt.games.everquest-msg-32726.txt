Thanks for the pre-warning. Any other good idea then? I need platinum
pieces, and at a decent rate, preferably better than camping that guard in
Neriak by the Lavastorm entrance for his swords (15 minutes between
battles).  At this rate I'm getting (assuming I can sell for 2pp, forgot
what I usually get) 8pp per hour.  I've also been told that Najena would be
OK at my LV (entrance part anyway, killing Ogre).  What about faction
messups there?  And I've killed a few stone guardians (them things that look
like Ogres covered in tar) and noticed faction losses.  Are those Neriak
Faction losses?  If so then who cares...If I ever want to go to neriak it
would be with a guild at a high enough LV for a raid to wipe out all guards.
