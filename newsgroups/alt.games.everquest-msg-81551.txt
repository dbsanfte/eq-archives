Brell's beard, woman! learn to snip a little~ including the whole patch
message was rough!

There is a rectangle to the left of your 8 main carrying slots. It says
"Auto equip area". Drop your items here, as if you were dropping them on
your picture.

To go back to the "old" inventory screen, go back to the windowed mode.
Use F10 to cycle through those modes.

Or, move all of your windows around (including the inventory box) until
you get a configuration that helps you read things better. You can even
resize several of the boxes. There's even a list of ALT-(letter)
commands that toggle the windows on and off- listed in
eqmanual.supplmental.txt in your EverQuest directory on your hard drive.

Hope this helps a little,
