Ok, so you are new to usenet, we've cleared that up nicely.  See I did 
say exactly what I was saying, its just that you aren't able to 
understand it.  Even after noticing that the other responses to your 
post followed a theme you seem unable to fathom that I was alluding to 
that very theme in my post... even though I told you that others would 
provide an explanation for you.  Those who have been on usenet for any 
length of time knew exactly what I meant, you are clearly not in that 
group or you would not have said what you said in the first place.

For a bit there I was wondering if you were Moses come back to lead us 
all to the promised land, but now I think even that was giving you too 
much credit.
