In a sense, there already is.

If you're getting attacked by five mobs, then when you kill
them you get five times as much experience than you would if
you had been fighting one...

Getting uber-buffed (especially with big damage shields) and
then aggroing a big pile of mobs all at once is a time-honored
and effective powerleveling technique.

You don't need an exp "bonus" on top of that.

Plus, getting more mobs on you than you can handle isn't
supposed to be something you get rewarded for, it's
supposed to be the punishment for your inability to
do proper crowd control.

Finally, from a programming standpoint I would think
that it would be hard for the game to keep a running
count of your "attacker tally", and without that it
couldn't do the sort of bonus you have in mind.
