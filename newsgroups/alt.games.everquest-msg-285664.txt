The login servers were down, but you could go to the Chat server along 
with the hundreds of other people doing the same; I was on general chat 
number 17 for a while, and I think the limit per server is upwards of 
200 people.

Eventually I did manage to log in, to find that anyone who'd been logged 
in was still logged in, and had been able to play the whole time, unless 
kicked by one of SOE's "LD to server select" bugs

So thats one vote in favor of leaving your toon up in bazaar trader mode 
whenever you're not playing, eh?
