Given that at a wild guess here, the various potions require a mana vial 
of the appropriate type, the higher end ones will get pricey to make.  
The distilled version would be 215pp or so to make the mana vial, then 
whatever the other ingredients cost on top of that.

There are already various potions for that, the problem is they are too 
expensive to make by far for the effect that they have, and they only 
last 20 minutes.  As I recall when I priced out making the highest level 
ones, it was something on the order of 200pp per dose to make it.  I 
think the Breeze potion (2 mana regen per tick, 20 minutes) was on the 
order of 75 to 100pp to make it.  Now, add in some profit for the shaman 
making the potions, and try to sell them.  The high end ones all trivial 
at over 180, not sure off hand what the trivial level is, so you need to 
be a high level shaman in order to have any reasonable success rate, as 
Alchemy is level capped.

Here are the potions in question:

Mystical Infusion 2 Sickle Leaves (not stacked)
+50 to mana pool 
Duration ~20 min

Greater Mystical Infusion
Yerbhimba, Sickle Leaf
+100 to mana pool 
Duration ~20 min

Elixir of Concentration
Yerbhimba, Violet Tri-tube
Regen 2 mana per tick 
Duration ~20 min
stacks with KEI 

Greater Elixir of Concentration
Duskglow Vine, Violet Tri-tube
Regen 3 mana per tick
Duration ~20 min
stacks with KEI 

Mystical Aptitude
Duskglow Vine, Yerhimba
Intellectual Advancement
(raises effective casting level +3,
thereby reducing fizzles) 
Duration ~20 min
