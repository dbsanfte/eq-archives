<<<<<<<<<<Or sitting on your ass for days waiting for a pop to occur.... over
time
this just keeps the money flowing into Sony while people sit around waiting
for MOBs and keep paying Sony.

It is a great way to make money and I am surprised how many people can't see

A couple of us can see through it.  The rest choose not to.  They've been
brainwashed into thinking they're having fun doing nothing and that they're
talented because they can sit doing nothing for extended periods of time.
