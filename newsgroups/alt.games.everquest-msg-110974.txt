Sorry, that was DT who seems to think that way.  When you've got to respond
to alot of these things, it gets tought to keep things apart and not loose
things in the cracks.  This thread is taking up the bulk of my off-time.

> I hope your friend at least attempted legal action.

spent there after legal action would be unpleasant, to say the least, and
that she wanted not part of a company like that (name not included to
preclude legal action against me)
