I don't know of any really good sites on her. She has
(depending on whom you listen to) 18K to 22K hitpoints. She
has no special magical resistances. Her AOE is an 800 point
per tick fire DoT that ticks 3 times quickly; it is
unresistable by PCs. (A level 60 with 255 FR in my guild has
never resisted it. Level 49 fire pets are supposedly immune,
just like Rak'Ashiir in CoM.

In my experience, the keys to killing her are things like:
+ Have the Enchanters put Rune V on as many players (big
tanks first) as possible.
+ Have everyone pretarget her by /assisting off of a
scouter/puller before the fight.
+ Have the Clerics hit the big tanks with Celestial Elixir
or Healing right before they go in.
+ Have a Pally with DA go in seconds before everyone else to
absorb the first blast.
+ Complete Heal is almost useless. Clerics may be more
useful casting DD like everyone else. Since Clerics are of
limited value, you may wish to precamp one for resses. (More
often than you'd think the raid kills the Queen, but all the
raid members die. Can you imagine how the Warrior feels
knowing that mob corpse will rot?)

People differ on whether to charge her in her room or pull
her to King (after you clear it). I've seen both work. If
you charge her room, have the Enchanters ready to put her
guards on ice from outside her AOE range before you charge.

Here is some OK info:
