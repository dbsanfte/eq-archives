Woah hold on there boyo, you just went down to an individual level and
platered your choices into a population discussion. The end result of
everyone following your choice is extermination of the species thereby
negating any need to discuss any of this philosophy. Not only that you
shifted the dicsussion from the level of the biology of chosing the genes
that get passed on to the child up a step to your personal choices.

Oh and I dont believe you any more than any other human has perfect cntrol
of themselves and their lives which is required for you to make even the
individual statment you do.

ANd now you add this into a discussion that is determining who is 'at
fault' for genes.

Fine then you ignore a vast spread of issues. Risk is risk. You dont
control risks becuase you dont have direct handle. And all too often what
people call predipositions turn out to be something else. Alzheimer's is a
classic for this. From this you placed a single answer to multiple issues,
some of which are so vastly different the same answer simply isnt
reasonable.

Also it clearly cites that you have no known genetic basis for your
statement as well. I cited the point of Alzheimer's. Until you find a
genetic factor and can name it you are guessing. And thats the point - if
you make ultimate decisions by deciding X is true then you can wind up
ignoring the real issue - that will cause more trouble in the long term.

Yes, leaving things open cracks that control you want. But that control is
only relevant if you are trying to control the right thing.

No Im pointing out that 'can' does not equal 'does' affect...Im also
pointing out that a lot of what people like to blame on genetics doesnt
necessarily come from it. The two interplay in a very complicated level
and you are not taking those into account.

You have made your choices for you. That's fine. The problem I have is
that you are then pushing those choices out onto a wide range of other
diferent issues with the global statement of its the parents fault, and
you are assuming that a guess you have made is correct. You can make that
choice for yourelf that the way you guess is the important result. You
cant make that for others.
