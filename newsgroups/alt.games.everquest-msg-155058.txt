Personally, I hate direct tells to me asking for buffs.  I often respond to
shouts and oocs, if I am not too busy.  If I want KEI, I go to Nexus, there
is just about always someone there casting it.  If I am sitting around in
the Nexus, waiting on a port or friends, I will usually respond to a direct
tell as well.
