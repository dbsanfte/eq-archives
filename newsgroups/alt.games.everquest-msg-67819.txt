Put enough into STA to raise it to 75 at least.  Then worry about the
rest.  I would split between STR and CHA.  STR because you always seem
to be carrying a bit more than you should, CHA because it actually has
an effect on certain very useful songs.

Again, get the STA up over 75.

I wouldn't worry that much about trying to maximize AC, since by the
time that AC starts making a big difference, you're moving well away
from being a main tank.  (Though I was tanking past couple nights in
Luclin, also had my AC up to 1180.)  I'm about +45STR compared to when
I was 45, high end melee stuff adds a lot of STR, not a lot of STA.  

The most important thing to remember as a bard is that you can almost
always outrun 'em.  Oh, and remember to drink a lot too, it seems to
help.
