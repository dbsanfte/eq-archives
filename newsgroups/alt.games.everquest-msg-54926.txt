And pay no attention to poison or disease saves.  My highest two characters
are 52 and 55 and I've yet to see much point in either.

It's a good idea to have a set of CHA gear, but only when dealing with
merchants.  To get the best price that you can (based on CHA only...faction
also plays a part) you'll want your CHA up to either 110 or 115 (I forget).
CHA vendor gear IS important to paladins if you intend to buy gems for the
Symbol line of spells.
