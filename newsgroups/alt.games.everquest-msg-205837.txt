Good point.

Interestingly enough I've gotten in the habit of using Pack Spirit
(group sow) instead of Share Wolf Form (group wolf form).  Too many
people click wolf form off because it stops them from using some
special skills such as bash and kick.  Then they ask for regular sow.

That's an interesting feature of wolf form.

My first character ever was a human warrior who was created long
before the human night vision de-nerf.  I couldn't see the walls
of Freeport when just 10 feet away so I wouldn't play during the
night.  Heh.
