Don't even need the new changes, 85/15 works for zoning into PoNB.  You 
need a minimum of 36 (I think that is the number) people in the raid, then, 
up to 15% of the raid can be unflagged and still zone in and participate in 
the raid.  It was bugged after the initial patch for the new 85/15 zones, 
and did not seem to work at all, but, I believe it is now fixed.
