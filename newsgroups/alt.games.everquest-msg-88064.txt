i've installed everquest on four different machines and had to run through
all the patches on each.  What I had to do once is find out which files had
been downloaded to completion, while the download was still going and copy
them to another folder.  The when the download stopped (literally would not
download anything else), I pasted them back in eq folder and started
download again.  It pickedup where it had left off then.
