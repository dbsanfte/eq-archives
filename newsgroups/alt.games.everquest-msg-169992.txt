Weren't you and Matt accusing me of being elitist for proposing to do
exactly that?

There are more than a few people around who would characterize
extreme RP-speak and its users in exactly the same way.  I disagree
with both you and them, finding deliberately unintelligible "speech"
to be simply rude.  Rudeness does not imply stupidity, even if the
two often keep company.

You're halfway there.  In my view, the dude-speaker, the backwards-
speaker, and the "extreme" RP-speaker are all being deliberately
rude in hopes of appearing to be "cool".  Rendering your messages
incomprehensible to the unintiated has nothing to do with telling
a story, nor is it anywhere near required to convey the feel of an
accent.  I've had a few friends in EQ who preferred to role-play
most of the time.  They were never unintelligible, about half of
them liked to use word choice and some easily grasped misspellings
to convey the feel of an accent, the others had no trouble at all
staying in-character despite "speaking" in an ordinary fashion
(which is the style of roleplay I am used to from PnP games, we
played the role while speaking normally to one another).  The thing
that made these folks fun to be with was that their roleplay was a
contribution, something they <gave> to the rest of the group, not a
hammy self-indulgent "hey look at me" affectation aimed at getting
attention.  If you're doing it just for yourself, then why are you
doing it in EQ?
