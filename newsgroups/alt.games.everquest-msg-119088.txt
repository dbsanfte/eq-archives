But if he gets a partner who also sends his pet, and then each of them
also casts a nuke or two per kill... then they get all the exp, and can
easily med up the mana in the short time a kill takes.  As long as the
two of them can kill twice the mobs as one could, this doubles the
exp rate... and if theres a slight loss of kill rate, well there is that
little
group exp bonus.

Too, if you let pet kill kill kill then you aren't spending any mana at
all.
Having a full mana bar wins you no prizes.  When soloing with pet,
a good trick is to kill a high con using your full resourses (so as to
outdamage the pet, and so as to get that kill your pet probably couldn't

solo) then when pet is sufficiently healed (they heal 10 times as fast
as a player, or 5 times as fast as mana regen) send them after lower
con mobs they can solo... so that, as you suggest, you get half of
something while you med up.  These are more advanced tactics,
though, I was merely suggesting that although a pet -can- rack up
kills solo while you stand around FM doing nothing, or laying in a light

nuke or two to speed things up, you are throwing away exp by
doing so at least on a per kill basis.  Question being, can your pet
solo more than twice the mobs per hour than he could with you
pitching in over half the effort?

Other question being, if you don't use magic to help kill stuff, then
why did you become a caster anyway?
