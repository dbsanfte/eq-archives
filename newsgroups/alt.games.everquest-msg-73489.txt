Yes - I do something similar (except my laptop has 384MB).  SoL on my
desktop, NOT on the laptop.  After activating SoL on my account, I got
the 'warning' on the laptop that my account was activated, but the SoL
files couldn't be found.  I checked the "don't tell me this again" box
and all is well - just can't go to the moon on the laptop. 

With the advent of the DX8.1 requirements, I've pretty much disabled
all sound, textures and sky on the laptop to keep things playable
(Tecra 8100 PIII 700, 384MB, ATI low end 3d mobile thingee).
