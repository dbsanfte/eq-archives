    Required level restrictions on all gear would solve the problem nicely.
You have to be level X to use the item, but if you were level X you could
also go to the camp the item dropped in with a level X group and get it
yourself (to show how you'd figure out what X should be). You keep some
semblance of replayability this way, as a person's twinks could have gear in
the bank waiting for them to level up as opposed to being on the twink from
day one. They'd be powerful when they were able to wear their gear, but
powerful in terms of having several items intended for people their level
versus the power boost from having items intended for people well above
their level.

    With the way the modern game is evolving, I wouldn't be surprised to see
more loot get the new "Attunable" tag versus a straight "No Drop" tag. No
Drop serves the purpose of making players want to evolve towards the zones
where the loot drops, but it also is a hurdle that casual players cannot
overcome in many cases. And if future expansions are tuned based on
ownership of that No Drop gear, the casual player falls further and further
behind and eventually quits in disgust.

    There has to be player progression, but it doesn't have to be through
mudflation. For example, imagine if every expansion in EQ had upped the
level limit and introduced new level-restricted drops for those new levels.
The game prior to the new levels would not be mudflated, although there
would be greater availability of level-appropriate gear. The big issue with
this game model is the barrier to entry for new players - it would feel very
much like a "rat race", and players wouldn't really be encouraged to spend
time at lower levels since the next expansion wouldn't have content for
them.
