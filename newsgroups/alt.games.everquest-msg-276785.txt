An interesting analogy.  However, I've seen people who XP-grind to get
to 60+ in the span of a few weeks, yet we age at a constant rate. :)

Perhaps one of the underlying problems of EverQuest, then, is more a
function of one of the underlying problems of leve-based RPG's in
general; there is no real-world analogy for "level."

It reminds me of a statement someone once said in a gaming group long
since forgotten; something to the effect of a sufficiently high enough
level warrior essentially capable of taking a direct shot from a
nuclear blast and writing it off a a mere scratch.

By putting a cap on the highest level attainable, Sony avoided one of
the biggest problems of MUD's (200+ level characters running amok),
while simultaneously putting a defenite "End" to what's supposed to be
a dynamic, never-ending game. I expect AA's have helped some (haven't
reached that point yet), but are still very finite.

Perhaps a better choice would have been something skill-based, with a
square-root function on the returns of higher skill levels: you can
infinitely improve your skills, but would have to have a skill of
infinity to reach that perfection limit.  Make the skill counter a good
sized unsigned double-double float, and wait for some obsessed
power-gamer to spend the next several months working on
overflowing/rolling over the skill counter.

Thing is, I see a lot of this.  At least on Veeshan.  Perhaps the
environment on other servers is different.  As I've stated, I'm pretty
new to the game, and not really familiar with much outside my own
limited sphere of experience.

Then it is even more broken than I had feared.

As a smaller aside, I may owe you an apology.  Many of the posts I see
from people about level 70 come from the afore-mentioned XP-grinders,
who really do seem to think only the last few levels are worth playing.
 I had made the rash assumption that you were perhaps one of these
people, and I apologize.

XP grinders and power-levelers simultaneously make me sad and
irritated; they continuously put down and berate the lower-level
content when they themselves admittedly and intentionally keep
themselves ignorant of the actual enjoyment of said lower levels.  When
I look back and think about how I used to think delving into Kurns
Tower was frightening, or having to tread lightly through Highhold...
these are good memories, ones that the XP grinders and powerlevelers
would never experience or understand, and it just makes me mad to have
such memories, and the associated content, belittled as "not really
part of the game."  People saying one cannot truely understand the game
at lower levels, I often think perhaps the person at the upper level
either skipped the lower levels entirely, or has forgotten just how
much can be experienced at the lower levels.

Or, perhaps I'm of a very small minority that actually likes to get out
there and experience as much of the game as possible at all levels.
