    Thank you.
    This is the most rational response that I could ever desire from "Ben
Sisson" (and am highly unlike to ever get from him) and you had it long
before him.

    I usually try to toss in extra "Copy & Paste" stuff because there
remains a lot of information that most people never even look for.

    Here is an example of a concern of mine (which also applies to "City of
Heroes" amongst many other online games).
    The old "Waiting to be killed" aspect of the enemies is a
disappointment.  Granted, the games are obviously "Plastic Universes"
populated by artificial constructs, but it would be nice to see foes with a
touch of life-imitation.  COH has improved with the muggers in mid-prolonged
mugging, gangs of Trolls grooving to an old-fashioned dance session, Mages
threatening competing gangs, etc...  all basic scripted events.  Perfectly
workable excuses to explain the presence of the foes in the areas that they
reside in just standing around for long periods for no logical reason.  I
personally would like outdoor patrols (a nice improvement to the indoor
missions) and perhaps even a "seeing one group of foes targeting another
group and attacking them" script instead of just walking into a session
where a gang of Outcasts are pounding away on a lone Troll gang member.
Perhaps even a gang of Hellions enjoying a quiet meal in an outdoor plaza
restaurant would be a nice touch.  Personally I like the humor touches of
the SWAT guy running around like a scared child (screaming in a woman's
voice too) in the indoor missions.  A variation on this for the outdoor
clumps of foes (in which one flees upon the start of the fight) would be to
have one foe to run screaming away in a panic with the remaining foes
stating, "For goodness sakes, you're embarrassing us" and "Real brave
dude..." and "Yeah, go get your momma to fight for you and we'll just wait
here until you get back".


Lineage II

    [clippinating a great amount of a good review to highlight a point for
emphasis]

Intelligence & Difficulty: The AI of Lineage II essentially does not exist.
I first noticed this in the newbie zones, where the enemies aren�t scripted
to behave as if they�re doing anything. The wide assortment of orcs,
goblins, imps and Keltirs just stand around, doing nothing. They don�t even
attack you if you walk right up to them. As you progress, this changes in
one small way: monsters eventually start attacking you. They still don�t do
anything, though; they don�t move from place to place as if occupied, they
don�t communicate at all, and there�s nothing about their behavior that
leads you to think that they exist for any reason other than to die by your
sword, bow or spell. Even when the creatures do become more aggressive, they
still don�t display any tactics. Once they see you, they run in your
direction and attack. Sometimes, they run when at a quarter of their full
health and come back as soon as they regenerate a few hit points. The
overall effect is unconvincing.

Due to the enemies� unsophisticated methods of attack and the
one-dimensional combat, Lineage II doesn�t offer much of a challenge.
Killing the same creatures over and over until you�ve reached a point where
you can move up to the next level and creature type, only to repeat the
process, is a challenge to your patience, but that�s all. The static combat
even hampers the one area where the most challenges should be found - the
PvP battles. The end result is a gameplay experience that�s wholly
unexciting and feels more like a chore than entertainment.
