I know it is very widely believed . I also know that we live in a
superstitious demon haunted world . Show me the proof , the p word , cause
otherwise I think those spouters of nonsense are full of it .

Everquest has 3 types of spawns that I have recognized . Spawns come off a
straight random table
1) spawns at a specific clock time of day .
2) is a triggered spawn
3) has a set spawn time after the last mob was killed and may have a
differing spawn table by specific clock time . BY FAR the majority of spawns
are like this .

Wiltin is type 3 . They where nice enough to add a despawn to him . Waiting
for him to despawn and spawn makes the camp longer not shorter.

I have killed wilton lots . My method was to hunt seafuries, gornit , and
the bucaneer when he popped . Wilton was so easy to get that I twice traded
ranger ivy legs for 8 hq bear skins . I only stopped when the outcast
brownies and gornit greened out ( though this was pre kunark ) . I have seen
wilton spawn some 20 plus times just killing his ph reguarly .

Let me reiterate . Wilton is the easy part of the quest. If you wait for him
to despawn your an idiot . And while you are there you might as well hunt
something else in the neighborhood like seafuries or spectres and then time
will just fly . Oh and make the cleric bind so that noone has to ride the
boat back in case of a cleric fuckup.
