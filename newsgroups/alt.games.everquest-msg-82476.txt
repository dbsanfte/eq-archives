No, no, no.. you ask a Gnome friend to make the new tinker item (Trivial at
396 tinkering) added since Luclin.
The Gnomish jet pack, made with a reconfigured rebreather with plenty of
gnomish spirits in the tanks
and fire it up with you favorite fire based DD spell and off you go.
It does have it's risks though, there is a 50% chance of the spirits
misfiring and blast you with 64328 damage.
Or a 48% chance of misdirecting than ending up in Plane of Air and the
remaining 2% is your actual
chance of ending up on Luclin.
