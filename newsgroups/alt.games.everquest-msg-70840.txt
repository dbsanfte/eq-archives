I dont think you've got enogh for complete suits of rygorr or Ivy there,
though you should be able to get a fair nunmber of pieces. Ivy is pretty
expensive because of the gems you have to put into it (and at one point
walk with 2000 gold pieces or so for some obscure reason). PLus the
players time and effort. I bought a rygorr head piece for 400 plat and was
told by most of my guild I had done well (what luclin has done Im not
sure). Thats on AB

Selling it may allow you to pick up some more 'tuned' kit for rangers and
that might be worth it since as you notice thats extremely tough kit for
your level so you're proably not using the full potential.

Ivy at 20????? Is this common...im 27 and have so far one bracer and the
mail.....the mail I got because people were being nice and handing the
drops over (or letting the no drops be looted by others) and the bracer
bits I had to fight for solo for the ring and redwind took a group where I
was the lowest level to do saefly (at 25)

Well everyone says that 2hs is good for being the second tank to keep
aggro down as you hit less often but for more damage....I personally dual
wield.
