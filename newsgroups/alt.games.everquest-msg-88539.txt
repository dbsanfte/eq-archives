This spell is a sore subject with my lvl40 Gnomish mage.  Let me start off
by saying that I do not recommend you wasting money on this spell.  If you
are curious about the novelty of this spell then only get MS1 to play with.
Why they even created and MS2 and MS3, I have no idea.

The following observations are from my own experience.  Things may have
changed since I have not used MS1 for quite some time:

They are not affected by focus items.

You cannot give them weapons (thus the lvl34 cannot dual wield).

They are simply new skins on basic elemental types:
one that roots (earth),
one that stuns (air),
one that casts dmg shield (fire),
one that casts fire-based spell (fire),
one that casts AOE spell (decoy),
(there may also be one that does just melee, not sure).

They will not be undead or race models, e.g. skeleton, iksar.

There is only a certain pool of creatures from each zone that can be
summoned.  Sometimes it is a model not native to the zone, e.g. Cyclops in
WC.  But it can be a variation of a zone model like Crushbone orcs in WC or
fire gobs in ButcherBlock.

That is all I can remember about Monster Summoning I.  My advice is leave
the actual fighting to your *real* pets.
