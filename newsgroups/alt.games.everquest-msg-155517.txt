Maybe it's knowing that in order to get back out, you have to fight
your way back out through all the mobs you had to kill on you way in
once they respawn. Possibilities arise for you to get stranded or
killed and face a really nasty CR. I remember falling through the pit
trap in Befallen once while exploring/pillaging the upper level and
having to wait until someone ventured by to open the door for me since
I couldn't kill the keyholder myself. The danger scares some off. I
usually enjoy the thrill. The xp bonus is nice too.  :)
