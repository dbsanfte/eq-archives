I seem to recall they changed that to 7 days on or off line, but I am not 
certain, I never leave a corpse lying around for long.

If I understand what happened to him, it was not the sisters that killed 
him, but rather the single spawn that often kills off "good" characters 
on that island.  In which case, there is no need to clear the island, 
just make sure the one NPC is not around, loot, and scoot.

Not really necessary for his corpse, unless he is KOS to the sisters too, 
even then, the invis idea is probably easier, and requires help from 
noone, if he has 10ish plat for an invis potion, or nothing, if he can 
invis himself.
