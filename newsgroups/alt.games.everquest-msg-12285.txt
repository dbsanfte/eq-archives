Wizards don't solo things by tanking them. My shaman does.

No, I just get hurt a little worse while I wait for the recast.

Haven't hunted there much? Most mobs knock dru/nec/enc/mag/wiz flat faster
than they can type "ADD!".

Situation: Warrior is dead. Tell me how he tanks better than the shaman.
Situation: Venril Sathir. None of your warriors are 55+ for riposte. *ANY*
class can tank as well as a warrior in that case (except 53 rogues with
their riposte discipline, who do it a lot better) with a set of enchanter
chain runeing them (which is how VS is done anyway even with a 60 warrior
as your primary tank, once his riposte disc has worn off).

You should avoid using absolute statements, they tend to make you look dumb
when someon can find a situation where you are wrong.

Nobody that I have seen has ever advocated taking a shaman over a warrior
as your main tank (past level 15 or so). ALL THAT HAS BEEN STATED IS THAT
SHAMANS CAN TANK WHEN THEY NEED TO, AND DO A PRETTY DAMN GOOD
JOB OF IT.
