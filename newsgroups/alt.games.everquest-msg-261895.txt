I think the GM has more power than we give credit for.  The GM came to
my aid after 8 hours while I was in Everfrost Peak.  He was able to
carry my corpse from PoK to Everfrost (without my consent I might
add), did a CS 100% rez with no effect and eveything was done.

I probably won't bother the CS for 20K death again unless I ended up
in hard to reach place. Just a little too much time to wait and risk
losing even more XP by not getting cleric to rez me.
