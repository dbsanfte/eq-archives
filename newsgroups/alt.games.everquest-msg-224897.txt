Kurn's is slightly lower ZEM, 150 vs 160 for Paludal, Crushbone, and 
Befallen.  Highest ZEM in game is 160 AFAIK, and that is for those three 
zones, next up is 150 for Kurns, Upper Guk, and Warrens.  This is all 
according to data I snagged from some link posted here at one time, can't 
personally vouch for the accuracy.
