Hm. Wouldn't it be "whatever that mob resists, you get resist gear for"?  
I mean when I'm fighting something that likes to cast cold spells, I 
don't bother with them because it resists them.  Heat, same.  Of course 
we're talking desert madmen here.... :)

And another question - you know how if you're in AoE range of your own 
spell, you get smacked too?  Does this happen to NPCs?
