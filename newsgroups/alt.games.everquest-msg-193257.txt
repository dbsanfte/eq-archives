Good Experience is a relative term.

In the lower levels basically anything you can kill qualifies more or less.
When you get higher up the mobs get harder and if you want straight exp you
have to find the best spot to get as much exp in as little as time possible.
There are certain factors you should take into account.

1 killtime - downtime. Killing a mob in 10 sec is good, unless you have to
med / heal up for 10 minutes after that. Certain tactics reduce dowtime or
killtime and what you need to look at is how fast you can kill taking
everything into account (pulling, mana use, hp use, etc). This also includes
the thoughness of a mob and it's relative exp value. Before the exp changes
some months ago it was better to just kill 100 light blue mobs for 1 exp
instead of 1 dark blue for 100 exp because the light blues just died so
fast. Nowadays it's better to kill 1 db mob for 1000 exp then (in the same
time) 100 light blues for 1 exp.

2 respawns - Killing 1 mob on a 10 minute timer over and over can be decent
exp. But killing 2 mobs for half the exp with a 4 minute timer is better.
Get a spot where your uptime/downtime is not hindered by the respawn times.

3 ZEM. Zone Experience Modifier. This is an artificial bonus to certain
zones which makes all the mobs there give increased (or decreased!)
experience per kill. For example, killing a sarnak in Burning Woods will
give you 100 exp. Killing that same Sarnak in Chardok (the dungeon connected
to it) gives you 120 exp. Rule of thumb: if there are less then 10 players
at peak times, expect a high ZEM for that zone. Outdoor zones give squat,
dungeons give lots. Planes of Power zones have a really out of whack ZEM and
mobs give extreme amounts of experience.

4 group - solo. Killing with groups gives a bit extra exp on the total, but
the total is devided after that over the group. So your 100 exp sarnak gives
120 exp for the group, but it gets split up into 6 pieces leaving you with
20 exp for that kill. Groups normally kill faster then soloers though and it
depends on your class, level, gear, etc to decide what would be better for
you to do. Also, a group can be unbalanced, too many healers, not enough
healers, not enough dps (damage per second) etc. which can cripple exp gain
for the whole group.

Good Experience is usually an optimal combination of the above factors.

Sometimes the term is used in reference to solo classes which skips point 4
entirely and simply focusses on the best solo hunting grounds. It generally
centers on actually be able to kill consistently and if there are enough
mobs. Wizards and druids who "quadkite" for example are generally focussed
on actually be able to kill and having another 4 mobs around by the time
they've medded up. ZEM and group issues are mostly ignored in those
discussions.


Hope it helps a bit :)
