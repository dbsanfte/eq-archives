Agree with the above about the difficulty and LONG time invested being part
of what makes it epic - consider greatest of epics, "Lord of the Rings":

Difficult?  Obviously...

Tedious?  VERY!  Re-read the thing every three/four years around the
holidays, and cannot keep from skipping over the second and third book's
passages with Frodo and Sam wandering and whining... even Gollum adds little
[maybe if he'd have been more like Joe Pesci...]
