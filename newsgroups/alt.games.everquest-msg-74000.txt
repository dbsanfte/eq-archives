There's a difference between the AC camp vs. the original JBoots camp.
AC, at least the SRo one is a random spawn on a random spawn table in
pretty much the whole zone.  The Nejena one was a rare drop off a
semi-rare static spawn.

They moved it and alievated it a bit.  They added a static spawn for
those that wanted a static spawn and also a random spawn for those
"lucky" ones that happened to be in the right place at the right time.
