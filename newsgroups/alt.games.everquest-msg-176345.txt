Opinions are going to be skewed and biased with this question. :) A
few years ago, I would tell you yes immediately. Nowadays, hybrids
have come a LOOOONG way from being mediocre tanks that dealt mediocre
damamge to top MA. Warriors hands down will always be the game's
premiere MT and they can do pretty good damage. However, and this is
the big however, Warriors fall far behind hybrids in terms of
maintaining agro and importantly, regaining agro. Results are going to
vary but as you get into the 50+ levels, having zero spells is a big
liability. The reason is, Warriors (like Monks and Rogues) have to
rely heavily on pure melee to grab agro. Taunt isn't going to do a
whole lot (you slowly increment your way to the top of agro list).
Spells on the other hand allow the caster to jump to the top of the
agro list. This is the biggest benefit with SKs.

If you're planning to dish and take damage, by all means choose
Warrior. However, understand if the mob turns from you and starts
beating on your Shaman or caster friend, you'll have a much tougher
time trying to get that agro back then compared to a Hybrid.

Enjoy.
