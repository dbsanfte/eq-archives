First off, so far most of Richard's posts have been done in first person (I 
think the one about his laser eye surgery was done third person, but that's 
the last one I recall).

Second, the only posts outside of this one I've seen have -positive- 
feedback on his posts.  What makes you think that you're speaking for any 
sort of majority here?  If you're going to speak for the masses, I suggest 
you get more of a clue about what they're thinking.

Third, fuck you for thinking you know what I or anybody else cares or 
doesn't care about.

Fourth, don't like it?  Nobody is forcing you to read it.  Killfiles are 
wonderful things, though I would label you an ass if you put Richard in 
there.  Actually, I think I already have.

Richard, keep writing 'em, I'm sure most the group will keep reading 'em ;)
