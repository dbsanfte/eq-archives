In each of these cases, there's a minimum required to play, but how can you
buy the "best horse"? Surely if such things existed, they would consistently
win races for example. You can buy a great horse, but you can't tell if it's
better than your competitor's. And once you start these games, you can't
chuck in more money to get a better result that the others will if they
start with the same level of equipment.

I have no problems with games having an entry fee. I have a problem with
money changing hands for a better result whilst the game is being played.
These examples don't really show that. Equestrianism is a particularly bad
example, a poor rider is going to make a great horse look terrible in most
events, and could even get himself and his horse killed, computer games like
MMOGs are much less skill based than real life and have zero danger, so long
as you aren't stabbed to death for cheating someone on a sale of a virtual
sword. ;-)
