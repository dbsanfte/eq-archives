Indeed, this is how I have made MOST of my money.  One of my first
"big" hauls was back when RMB's were still going for around 1k on MT.
As I play early mornings EST, there isnt a large market around then so
buyers are often willing to pay more if they really want something as
the number available is limited and sellers are often willing to take
less due to the small number of buyers.  

Anyways, a guy is advertising "WTS Runed Mithril Bracer CHEAP!!!!" so
I sent a tell asking him to "define cheap".  He said "Well, they are
running around 1k now but I REALLY need the money and would go around
300p.".  He took the 281p I had on me and 2 days later I sold it for
950p.    Had another one with Axes of the Ironback when they went for
175p.  Guy had a bunch at 50pp.  I bought all i could and resold for
profit.  You do have to know prices though and have no problem hanging
in EC or Gfay.

I often get asked "HOW can you get such GOOD deals?" and my reply is
usually "I am here to see the deals while you are out adventuring."=)

I have done this for friends.  I get bit though when the buyer wants
to trade and I call the seller and ask if they are interested and they
are.  I cant take 20% out of a Golden Bracer LOL.
