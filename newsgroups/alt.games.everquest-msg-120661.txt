Note that the current patch messages says that they are aware of but cannot
fix at this time the problem with res timer not running while the player is
offline.  Looks like the res timer being 3 hours online time really is a
bug.

*Sigh*.  I wonder if they will be stupid enough to actually try to fix this,
thereby encouraging people to avoid playing off-peak hours.
