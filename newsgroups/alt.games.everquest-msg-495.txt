I hear this was fixed too, however, some time after it was reported to be
fixed I read a post some where by somebody who had this very thing done to
them.

Luckily, like this other fellow mentioned, he had himself in his /friends
list. He and his buddies seen his duplicate online and quickly /petitioned.
I wonder what would've happend if they hadn't seen this and reported it so
quickly?

Of course, maybe by NOW it's fixed, something this big would be hard to push
aside, but we all also know VI's track record. heh heh..

This all makes me wonder if I should put myself on my friends list.. I don't
know.

Then again, not allot of people know me so I don't think I have allot to
worry about. I also keep my main anon, so they couldn't target by level...

Any of you folks know for /sure/ this is has been fixed now?
