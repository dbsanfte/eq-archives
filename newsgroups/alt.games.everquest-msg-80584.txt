    Something is wrong here. The damage on this weapon isn't 4, is it? As a
point of reference, backstab damage is roughly proportional to the damage
rating on the weapon you use main hand. This doesn't change your minimum BS
damage (there's a minimum amount you can hit for when backstabbing).

    Mainhand, I'd usually go with the weapon with the best combination of
ratio and base Dm. To compute ratio, take Dm and divide it by Del - the
higher the ratio, the better. Since that Dm on the Pick isn't right and I'm
too lazy to go to Allakhazam's, I'll compare the other two. I get 7/24 =
.2917 for the Needlite Stinger, and 5/17 = .2941 for the Tombcarver. The
other stats on both are small, and unlikely to make any real difference in
your performance. In the offhand, only ratio matters, so Tombcarver is
better there. The low delay on it also means you'll be swinging more per
fight, and thus raising the skill faster after initially training it. If you
were considering just these two for mainhand, you'd go with the Stinger -
only marginally less damage, and a lot more backstab damage.
