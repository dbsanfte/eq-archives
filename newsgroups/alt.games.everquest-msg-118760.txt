NBG is generally total BS in pickup groups.  In my experience, when
somebody wants NBG in a pickup group it usually (not always, but
usually) means that they are doing their damndest to manipulate
their play circumstances for maximum personal gain, deliberately
leaving certain gear in the bank and/or only looking to group in
places where they can claim "need".  That is to say, in a pickup
group some stranger who wants loot to be "NBG" is usually telling
you "I'm a greedy SOB trying to guilt you into giving me an unfair
advantage".  OTOH, as Wolfie said, in groups of friends or guildmates
NBG is very often the rule.  After all, friends and/or guildmates are
pretty likely to help you get what you need as well.

In fact, a lot of casual guild activity amounts to an ongoing informal
"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" sort of arrangement.
This arrangement is often unspoken, but those who don't participate
(i.e. only go places where loot they want/need drops) end up branded
as "lootwhores", which is not a reputation you want in-game.
