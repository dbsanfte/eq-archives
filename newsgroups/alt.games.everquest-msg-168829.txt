I have a crystal clear notion. I am not my company. I don't care what
kind of deal that a politician makes causing "corporate Welfare". At
least the company is going out and smoking crack or drinking booze on
that welfare. Seriously, most outfits make a sweetheart deal with
local government because other local governments are willing to give
incentives to move there. Pro football is an excellent example, look
at all the tax breaks they get!

I sense fuzzyness. Piece of what? I am not paying you a dime unless
you get a soldering iron and work.

You want a piece of the road? Would you rather drive on it?

Like how? Companies make money by selling the equipment with hard to
find parts, that is labor intensive, often with all kinds of odd
restrictions. Some jobs pay for others.

Work for a defense outfit and you will see how frustrating the
government makes it to deal wih them, I am happy to deal you a piece
of that.

My labor is my labor. We enter into an agreement that we will chip a
little off each paycheck, to provide for those who can't provide for
themselves. I am happy to pay a little and make sure that a quad down
the road has what he may need.

The system is out of control. It is because of this entitlement
mentality you have. You want a piece? Make a piece. There are needs
that are left unfulfilled, and people paying money to meet them. Jump
in there, we would love to have you make your own way.

Counting the number of minorities in a business. I don't see asian,
white and black people, I see engineers, I see techs, I see suits. I
don't see anything but the fruits of people's labor.
