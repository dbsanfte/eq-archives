Reasons it is a good design choice :

If you could be in trader mode while off line *everyone* would do it. This 
would mean that there would be (guestimate) 5000 players trying to sell in 
the bazzar at once. You thought it was laggy with 500
The fact that you have to be online cuts the number of players who could be 
traders down significantly, and requiring them to still be running EQ cuts 
it down even further.

Reasons it is a bad design choice :

Bandwidth
Players (may) pay more for internet
And I guess that they are not too concerned about either of these.
