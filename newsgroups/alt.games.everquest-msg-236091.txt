	Oh, great Ghu, not that again.  "Gee whiz the shark dropped
ten million plat!  How was I to know that wasn't supposed to happen?
Especially when I did it 10 times just to see if it was a mistake."

	If you make use of an exploit and get rolled back unfairly
you could petition, hmmm?  Maybe the moral is "don't take advantage
of exploits".

	Yes, that's true.  I suggest that the fact that this happens so
very often on the EQ servers is evidence that either these instances 
aren't really that serious or that Sony has such a disinterest in quality
that they simply allow such serious flaws to make it into production.
Niether is an attitude that evidences concern with their customer, and 
**that** is what I'm objecting to.  The downtime thing is merely a
symptom of the problem.
