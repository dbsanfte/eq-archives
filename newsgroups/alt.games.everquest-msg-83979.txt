I concede this point.

I concede this point.

Upon further evaluation of my feelings on the subject, I'm
convinced I just don't enjoy playing a wizard.

I'm probably looking for a class that can do a lot more things.
Not necessarily do all of them well, but I think I'd enjoy the
variety.

I guess that's where I've been going all this time.  I don't
think wizards offer a lot of variety.

I believe it.

You're right.  It took me a while to realize that it's not
the usefulness of wizards that bothers me, just the lack of
variety.

Chill out.  It's not like I insulted your mother.

Tsk tsk.
