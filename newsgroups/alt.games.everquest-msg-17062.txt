Actually I find Drive-by invites quite acceptable, It's very simple: Accept
or Reject. It's not an earthshattering problem. Many players use the WHO
command to try to team with others of similiar levels, so asking your level
isn't necessary.
Invite was added to the game for a reason, no sense shooting down people who
want use it. :)
