Where in this entire thread, at this point in the discussion, did *I* say
raid?  He doesn't do this on raids, only in exp grouping.  (on raids there's
the "pretty colour" hunt)

And everything else is pointless to argue about for both of us, it's just a
screaming match by now and I'm willing to end it by not arguing any further.
