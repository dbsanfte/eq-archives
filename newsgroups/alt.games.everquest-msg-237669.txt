Sounds to me as if you were doing fine.  I am a Cleric and when I aggro a
mob, I will stand for a second and issue a help cmd.  If no response
immediately then I will run around the area (without aggroing new mobs of
course) until I can get a good root on him.  Of course there is less danger
in it for me as I can usually take more of a beating and I have the Divine
Aura spell always memmed.
