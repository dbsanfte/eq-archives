I can't find ANY of these items referenced on Casters Realm or Allkhazam.  I
guess they are just having trouble keeping up with Luclin and all the new
quest items.  Some of it is sure to be just junk, but other items I'm sure
are probably quest related, or used for trade skills in some way.  Please
help if you know anything about any of these items:

Essence of Wind (looks like a potion bottle-looted two in Tenebrous
Mountains)
Earth Etched Wand (magic item, no stats, also found in Tenebrous)
Mark of Secrecy (looks like a rune-NODROP-also in Tenebrous-someone said it
was rogue quest, but didn't know details)

Then the really junky junk:
Wetfang Eye- (found in Paludal)
Glass Eye-(don't remember where I got this)
Giant Wolf Fang
Sonic Wolf Fang
Sonic Wolf Ear
Grimling Blood
Drachnid Blood
Mug of Sea Foam

Also I was out fighting somewhere (some friends drug me along and I didn't
pay attention) and I came across a Gem of Nimbleness on one of our kills.  I
left it because I was trying to curb my need to loot everything that might
possibly be of value at some time.  Within 30min 2 people are yelling that
they want to loot this item.  It was too late, it had decayed.  I asked what
it was for and was told a rogue quest.  That's all.  Being that I had just
passed up on the one rogue item I had ever come across I was pretty bummed.
However, I haven't found any reference to this item either.  Anyone know?

Thanks for your help.
