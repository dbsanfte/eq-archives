Yep, imagine your necro at ninth level sending in his level one pet.  Forgot
to buy the level 4 and 8 ones, he tells you.  Oh, and forgot to buy any of
my good DOTS or anything like that, either.

If you want to get a DoT in, cast it to pull with.  If you want to cast a lot,
find someone to group with who can be the speed bump, cause your
pet just isn't going to hold back anything capable of tearing its way out
of a wet paper bag!

On the other hand, YOU are while your necro was doubtless rapidly
approaching the wet paper bag level by this point.

PS another strategy for an SK who wants to cast a lot would be to
open with snare, then run ahead, cast, run ahead, cast, and so forth
all the way back to your pull spot, where you can melee while your
pet joins in.

PPS I'm very serious about the rusty two hander thing.  Pet should
be hitting just as hard as your necro's level 8 pet would with the
same rusty two hander
