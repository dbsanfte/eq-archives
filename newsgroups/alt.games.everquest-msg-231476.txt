: Level up to 8, lose your body, so you ... delete?

Anger and frustration are funny animals.  It was not my finest moment, nor
my most "adult" decision.

:

: lost, and the roughly 10 minutes worth of killing it would take to
: replace the tiny exp loss you suffered.
:
: Deleting, on the other hand, represented 10+ hours of leveling up -plus-
: the same 15pp in cash plus misc gear value.
