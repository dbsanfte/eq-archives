Tooling along as a bard, I've hit 29 and still no carpal tunnel
syndrome...

At any rate, I think I've asked this before, but does anyone know of
a good breakdown of bard songs?  For my purposes it must be
-very- specific, not generalizations like on EQDiva ( a fine site,
but quoting a damage range for a song like Chords of Dissonance
from 2 to 51 per tic just doesn't cut it)

I'd like to sit down and analyze what optimal combinations
of songs really are, rather than operating mostly on feel
the way I have been, but without some numbers to work
from, this isn't really easy to do.

For example, I can play boastful bellow (14 dd, one target)
or chord of Dissonance (for... who knows how many
points, 29 times three round duration? 82 points in the
same time)  I was twisting bellows in for a while, but
currently I rarely use the song at all
