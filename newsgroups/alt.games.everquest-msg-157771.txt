Prices on a lot of items vary by server.  On the servers I've played on
BA Medallion runs 800-1k.  Some of the prices you've talked about on xev
sounded ridiculously high to me (can't recall any specifics atm), this
item is more reasonably priced on xev.  *shrug*

For the 90% who don't level at a breakneck pace this is a pretty decent
piece of cheap twink gear for a wis-caster (including hybrids), IMO.
For an only occasionally played non-twink like my Druid on FV it's
great.
