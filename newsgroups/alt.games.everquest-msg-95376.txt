You're in a GROUP, not solo.  If the difference in maximum damage is 2hp 
per swing, that's less than 4%, and I think any melee class would much 
prefer to have 4% less damage from Jobaber as long he doesn't root the 
damn mob!  
I think this is a very telling discussion, especially in regards to why 
certain solo classes seem to have problems getting groups.  First, more 
group oriented characters don't know all the intricies of the solo 
classes, so we may not know exactly what they bring to the group.  On the 
other hand we have soloers who are so used to being absolutely as 
efficient as possible that they don't understand how a bit less damage may 
be much more valuable in a group in certain situations.  I'm certainly not 
saying that you're not a great grouping mage, but you might want to 
reconsider the pet you choose.  
I know that when I'm leading a group, I will ask a mage to replace the 
earth pet with ANYTHING else, because the extra 4% damage meanst that the 
mob is doing 10% more damage to us, and that the healer can't just 
concentrate on the main tank.
