Well two of the races that can play druids get cultural
leather armor, so that is kind of up to the individual
player, but druids can only wear leather class armor with a
few exceptions, for some chain graphic all/all items.

As for the trade window if you are wanting to trade with
someone you have to pick the item you want to trade up so
its on your cursor then click on the person you want to
trade with.
