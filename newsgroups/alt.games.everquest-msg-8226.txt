I'd be curious what you think of LOIO now, vs six months ago. I think you'd
find that it is possible for that zone to become over-crowded. I *did* find
times where I just camped my monk and played another char because I couldn't
find a place to hunt.  Or I had to buy SoW potions so I could "compete" for
mobs. Many of my guildmates in their 20's have moved to WW to hunt because
of the crowding in LOIO. Several friends I made from my barbarian days came
to LOIO, but then headed elsewhere. In off hours it's not so bad, but during
prime time...

Anyhow, at least I know it wasn't my imagination that there wasn't any
experience bonus while I was hunting there! :-)
