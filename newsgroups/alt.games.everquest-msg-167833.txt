Hi guys,

I did want to update some of what I said... Nathan was more helpful the
second day.

But the fact remains, the Wicked3D software that runs the glasses on non-
Nvidia cards would not run on a Matrox G400 card, trust me.... I tried
everything because I really wanted them to work, however not enough to give
up the Matrox card.

I worry about the future of 3D as Wicked3D, who has been backing out of the
market the past 2 years took their Website off-line last month.  I called
them and asked the receptionist if they were still in business, he said they
were "moving over the holidays"...  (I wonder what that means.)

eDimensional is strictly marketing and support and does not write software,
so where does 3D go from here?
