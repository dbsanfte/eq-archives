I installed it and played a bit a few months ago, graphic is very
blocky but the game grows on you, with the 1.75 or was it 2.13 patch.

The upcoming sequel Morrowind will be single and multiplayer and it
also includes the editor that was used to create the game, can be
lot's of fun and i will get that for shure having played both Arena
elder scrolls and daggerfall, the battlespire game was a big let down,
if you could get it to install in the first place :(
