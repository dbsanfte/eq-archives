Actually no, I don't have to admit they're ineffective.  I can believe that
they don't do what you want them to, but maybe it's because you're asking
from them stuff you really have no business asking for.   I've petitioned
less than 10 times (except for vulgar names) in 3 years.  If everyone only
petitioned when they were SUPPOSED to
(http://tweety.bowlofmice.com/tweety/try_being_a_guide.html) they'd be able
to answer legit petitions a lot faster.

They are allowed to do their job.  They have the tools to do their job.  The
people crying "ineffective" are often those who don't like the job
description.
