The bag duping is the truth but I don't think there will be roll
backs.  The duping is still live and has been going on for too long.
The last time SOE rolled back, there were lots of outcry.  Too many
people who weren't aware of the problem got rolled back and lost
legimate items and xp.

After that fiasco SOE may just roll back those directly involved in
the duping or something but not the whole populace.  I do know they
are watching a certain npc very closely and will suspend anyone that
is caught using the exploit.

PS not just leatherfoot haversack but also tae ew hide sack and AAAA,
and possibly other.  Just avoid buying any bags if they aren't sold on
vendor normally.
