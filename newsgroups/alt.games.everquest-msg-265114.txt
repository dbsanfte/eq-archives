   I think that it remains to be seen, but probably yeah.  When CoH was
released there was much talk about it, after a couple of months of it
running that died down.  Dunno if the same will happen for EQII.  I have a
feeling that it will be a bigger game than CoH, and one that is more apt to
continually spur discussion.
