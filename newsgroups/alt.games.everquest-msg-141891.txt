When do Druids get a port to Hate spell?  That's the one that has caught us
a couple of times now.

We have lived without chanters and warriors at times, none of our raids have
actually absolutely required those, at least none that have been cancelled.
Clerics have only been a problem once I think, not enough for a CHeal
rotation.  Most of our raids are not uber enough to really require that
though.
