The reason I said both "Past" and "Into" is because both situations
are common with stupid kiters.

Some will drag a train of Specs "past" the docks in Oasis. Specs
slice&dice anyone that gets in their path. I don't bother to send a
tell or a shout. I nuke the Specs into next week before they can kill
too many lowbies.

Other times I will be sitting near (not on) a zone line, and a kiter
will run past either to zone or to be near the zone and drop his train
on me (or those also sitting near). This usually happens in EC when a
guard killer agros Slate. They always seem to run around the tunnel
entrance, or dash inside. I think they are hoping Slate will agro onto
another guard killer, and leave them alone. Everyone knows EC is an
auction zone, and only the stupid and malicious will train guards
through the tunnel. 

To sum up my policy......

If someone kite's something and it is a threat to lowbies, or myself I
am taking it out. There is absolutely no reason to kite past other
players. It is simply rude and stupid.

Cheers
