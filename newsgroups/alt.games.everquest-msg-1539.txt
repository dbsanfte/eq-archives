Trust me, when I saw NOW LOADING pop up, I was stunned. I was fully prepared
to wander about aimlessly for a while based on all I had heard of HH's
twists and turns. The only wrong turn made, I think, brought me to an inn or
shop or something. Highhold Residents standing around. Did a quick backtrack
and in a few minutes I was at what must be the famous camp spot. Real
time-wise, HH was probably the zone I spent the least amount of time in.

Who-da thunk it?
