Boy, do I feel silly now.  I just tried the /bug command on my mule in
the bazaar & noticed that there is a box at the bottom where I'm
suppose to report the bug.  I don't remember seeing that box before.
Previously, I was trying to type in the information box at the top.
Thanks for the help guys. I appreciate it.  

 I'm going to report this bug right now.
