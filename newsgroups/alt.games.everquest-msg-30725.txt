Um... I don't think you're getting the point here.  The 'reason' would be 
to annoy nearby people.  Remember when they changed the eating emotes so 
people couldn't 'fake' eating and spam people's screens?

Besides, even if they DO have a reason to do it, repeating it all the 
time makes it REALLY annoying.  Like I already said, if I have to 
practice something, I move to a quiet place where people don't have to 
change their filters to suit me.
