As a whole for example when you solo, you would just use your drum
mostly, 4 dots (at a highish lvl) and selos.

Especially with the many items and augs you now get which add
instrument effects, there are few songs which require instruments and
of course many which improve with one.  Invis, and some of the hastes
require instruments rather than preferr..

I thought I would wholey suck as a bard.

I probably do, but I am now lvl 65 and people tell me I dont suck..

I normally have 4 songs going during battle, either 3 hastes and
heal/mana or 2 hastes, resists and heal/mana.

:)

Believe me, if I can.. You can
