I'll have to check on this.  It has become a matter of interest, since our
enchanter and druid got Dire Charm, figuring out which they can DC and which
they cannot.  I could have sworn I pegged a 49 as dark blue, and was
somewhat questionable on if I'd seen a 48 as full blue(memory isn't what it
once was :p)

I'll con some level 49 / 48 players next time I'm in game.  E'ci is down for
maintenance this morning.
