It would've been nice if ease of travel scaled with level in some
fashion.  If there were open to all travel capabilities that were
effectively level restricted and failed to match what the porting
classes had to offer we'd have our cake and be able to eat it too,
so to speak.  PoK ports are convenient as hell, but destroy the
"largeness" of the game world in a way the Luclin ports did not.
