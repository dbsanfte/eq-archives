I have earned all both me and my troll have on tailoring (talking around 60K or
more), but on the other hand, it take TIME.
I spend 3 weeks, playing 12-16 hours a day, only killing green mobs, so no XP,
and around 4-5K on pelts (didnt feel like hunting 600 HQ cat pelts myself) to
get to skill 100.
Its worth it now, have nice stuff, but the playing time on my level 34 druid say
34 days, might have been richer if i had just levelled and gone on raids.
