What do you mean by capping maximum damage? I think the maximum swing 
with my shaman was about 120. That's without capped weapon skill

Of course not. That is due to lack of second, third, etc. attack, as 
well as low ATK values compared to melee classes
And (just to be an ass), before Kunark, my shaman could compete with 
paladins in melee damage :) That is if we were self buffed. It went like 
this: both have approximately same weapon skill (200), both have haste 
item, paladin has double attack, and shaman has Alacrity and about 100 
more strength. Also, shaman would (pre-Kunark) have a better weapon as 
well

You are absolutely right here
