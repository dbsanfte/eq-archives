I think you misunderstand the concept.

You buy an offline game for a one-off payment. A few days later its finished
and in the trash can.

You buy an online game and pay a monthly subscription. Two years later
you're still playing it, and you've had assorted updates and expansions in
that time.

You get what you pay for.....
