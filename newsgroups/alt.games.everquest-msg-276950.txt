All of that is well and good - except that, you have to sit at your
comp while waiting for the boat to show, and you'd better be sure you
aren't away from it when you arrive.  Add to that how flaky they could
be and you had a source of huge frustration rather than fun.

The first time I took a boat I said "wow -cool" the umpteenth time I
just sighed in boredom.
