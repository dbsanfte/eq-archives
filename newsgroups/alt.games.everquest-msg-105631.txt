The Coldain Prayer Shawl quest. Many a doctor has made a fair que of
patients with CTS (Carparal Tunnel Syndrom) because of this series of
quests.  For many in the casting community, a cloak with AC INT WIS (other
stats) and Flowing Thought is a very worthy goal;  but the cost is a loss in
both manual dexterity and sanity points.  As far as putting training points
into trade skills, not only is it a good idea to prime it with one (why go
through several combines just to get up to '1') but in the instance of
tailoring - where many of your supplies will either have to be farmed or
bought from other players or aquired by 'vendor diving' - it will save much
time and trouble by bypassing the lower trivials if you put in as many as
possible.  The high -end quest will require you to be half-way Grandmaster
in many skills:  including fletching, jewelery, possibly even fishing ( I
don't recall if being a 'Master-baiter' helps in fishing for the items
needed).  www.eqtraders.com has an excellent piece on these quests, if you
haven't yet seen it.
In short, at level 54 and having 262 training points putting points into
trade skills isn't so much an investment as it is a luxury.  you've earned
'em so use 'em, and save yourself clicking madness.
