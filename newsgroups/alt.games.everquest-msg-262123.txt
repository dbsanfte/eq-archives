Some dislike his futile stupid war, some the fact that he's a moron, 
some that fact that there is a moron instigating and leading a futile 
stupid war...

Keep your eye on Bush he's decided to make a mark in those history books 
too.

Bush did not work his way up from a working class 'hood in suburbia and 
neither did any one else. 'Inheritance' or not they were born into an 
Old Boys Club, and have a network of people at their fingertips and that 
opens doors lots of doors. Doors to things most people only dream about, 
things like being the President.

Bush may have more direction than Kerry... but its not a positive 
direction. I'd rather see a do-nothing than a do-wrong in a seat of 
power. Kerry would get my vote in a heart beat if I happend to be an 
American.
