Why does it have to be about damage?   And in a raid environment I really
wouldnt be so sure if I were you, that mages have a superior DPS to a
druid..

You mean by fding and rezzing?  We have monks with rez sticks if the shit
hits the fan.. which is a lot more reliable then a necro's FD.

avaialble.

I've never once seen a raid called off for this reason, or somebody to say..
"we NEED magicians if were going to kill <insert uber mob name>"
