Thanks for the suggestion, I have been to Valor a few times, but only
to assist others as a tank and have never really tried soloing the
skellies there so I'll make sure to give that a try. I really had no
idea Arcstone had undeads, but then again I've only been in Arcstone a
few times as well. I've only been to SF once a while back (when I
couldn't realy hang in zone as well as I probably could now), maybe
it's time for a return visit.
