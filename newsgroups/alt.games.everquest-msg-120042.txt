      Well, more mana, as other posters have said.  Also, you'll
receive an increased chance of getting a skill increase each time
you use a skill that's based on WIS, or that's based on either your
WIS or INT, whichever is higher, assuming it actually is (and it is
with most WIS-based pure spellcasters).
