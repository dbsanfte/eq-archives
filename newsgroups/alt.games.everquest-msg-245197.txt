[top-post fixed.  Please bottom post here!]

On the server select screen, right under the list of servers is a little 
line that says 'X expansions activated'.  It's green if you have all 
expansions to date, red if not.  If X is lower than the value you 
expected, there's a problem. :)

Count one each for Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP, LoY, LDoN, and GoD.

If X is less than 7, there should be a button on that page for activating 
expansions.
