Hmm, I've not been able to verify it works on a bard's charmed pet, but 
the rather short charm duration could have something to do with that.  
Some pet commands do not work on bard-charmed pets, i.e. /pet report 
health.  I just assumed this was the same.  I'll test it again.

As to a reason for druids to use this, their track is better than bards, 
but can't see the entire zone.
