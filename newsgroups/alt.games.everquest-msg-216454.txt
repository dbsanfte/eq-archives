When soloing, I can keep a sustained, nonstop DPS of 50 to 60 against 
Crystalline Golems in PoV.  Pull, root and rot, pull next one.  As I recall 
they have 20khp, which is what I am basing the DPS on.  If I don't have C3 
or better, I have to take a short break between mobs to finish regenning 
mana.
