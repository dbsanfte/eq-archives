I just reopened my account after 1 1/2 years.  I play a level 26 enchanter
on The Nameless and I'm currently hanging around Crushbone, trying to
remember how to play and what my spells do (its amazing how much I forgot!).
One thing I notice now is how empty everything is (at least in and around
Crushbone).  Could be the time of night, 11pm pst.

My question is, 1 1/2 years later, where are good enchanters needed?  What
are the popular zones for level 26 groups right now.  I'm looking for areas
where groups can often be found.  I used to fight in the Sarnak fort, and
might head back over there, but possibly somewhere else?  I don't have
Luclin or Vel, but could get them if required.  That brings up another
question:  I've heard Vellious is really only for higher levels.  How about
Luclin?  Is it worth getting?  I'm a casual gamer at best, so I'll probably
be around level 26-30 for awhile.

Thanks
