Hmm, back in the "good old days" when boat travel was the only option for 
a poor character, I used them all the time, and never once had an issue 
with them.  I do remember after one of the expansions that the boats got 
horribly broken, and basically, never got fixed, and we started getting 
permanent boat gnomes.  That was around the time when the boat to 
freeport from butcherblock could be found somewhere in the middle of 
butcherblock at times.
