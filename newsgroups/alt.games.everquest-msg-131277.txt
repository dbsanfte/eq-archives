    While that is an important contribution, we also have other capabilities
that are utilized on a raid, which do no good if we are in West Commons,
picking up a straggler, to go to Chardok...  Backup healer when the Cleric
is OOM.. I don't know how many times that's prevented a total wipe out...
Many times, I play crowd control (my guild lacks a high level enchanter)...
so I snare an add (getting aggro), then let it follow me down the hall, and
park it with root...  use dots, nukes, Chloroplast (regrowth in a couple
levels), Damage Shields, buff, buff, buff...  We have TONS of skills we can
bring to a raid... Porting is just one aspect of it... :)
