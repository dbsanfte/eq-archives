Yeah, my 5200-256 worked fine too, but, the performance was lackluster at 
best, very glad I upgraded to a 9800 Pro.  All 3 of my NVidia cards 
worked fine for EQ, MX400-64, 4 ti-4200-128, and the 5200-256, in all 3 
cases, I upgraded due to the rising performance requirements of EQ.  
Actually, the 5200 was just a mistake all around, it was not faster than 
the ti4200, but, my 4200 bit the dust and needed to be replaced.
