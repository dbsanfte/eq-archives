I stopped playing everquest awhile ago(1yr or 2) and I recently became able
to play again.  I reinstalled the game and  first tried to
make a new account.  When I was done typing in all the info I  got a message
that the keykode had already been used. I then attempted to  change the
account.  I tried the old login name and password and that didn't work.  But
man was I thinking!  I made a new name and password.  But alas my brainstorm
quickly fizzed. It said something to the tune of I had to use my old
login/password.  I've tried calling support but can't get a godddamn human.
I tried to E-mail but for some reason I can send E-mail out but can't get
any in.  Any posts here would be a great help.   Oh and I did not get any
help from their automated  help lines.
                                Well thanks in advance I hope.
