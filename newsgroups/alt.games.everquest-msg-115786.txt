    Really? On my server WW is filled with people after a patch, until all
the Hound spawns have Cragwyrms or other CoV-aligned trash in them. Then it
empties again.

    Druids are the class that could do it solo, as they could kill the
hounds solo and (more importantly) track them solo. Other classes will
likely need to get help, although I bet a CoV-aligned ranger or bard could
find and take them too. The ranger and bard can't insta-port to CS and
Succor across SG, though....

    There's more than you might imagine, and there's not a lot of hound
spawns to begin with. For such a big zone it can feel awfully small when two
groups are there.
