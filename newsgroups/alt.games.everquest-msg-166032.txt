when you are in Rathe Mts , give Cyntha in the gypsie camp by the Lake Rath
zone a try.  I lvl'ed up to 42 on her.she goes to light blue at 42.  she can
drop up to  4pp ,  various gems, and other item that range from 2pp - 6pp.
have made up to 150pp in an hour or so. I mostly used fear and DD spells. no
faction hits and others at camp won't help her. I belive she is a Shaman.
