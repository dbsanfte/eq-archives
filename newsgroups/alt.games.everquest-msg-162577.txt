I decided to turn off /role when I got 56 so I could gloat to a few of
my guildies about getting there first (Long story).  In one night I
got at least 5 tells asking for ports.  Two of these people were in
the old world while I was in PoP.

Could you please explain to these winners that there isn't a market
for ports any more?  Please?
