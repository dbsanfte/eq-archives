You mean hotkeys, not ability keys.  There is a seperate configuration for
each character.  On one character you had hotkey 9 set to do sense heading,
on another character, you had hotkey 9 set to do a LFG.  If the
configuration files had been the same, then you would have done the sense
heading on both characters.
