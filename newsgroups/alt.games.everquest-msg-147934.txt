Best thing about this is Monual is an exceptionally nice guy as well.  
During the switchover from @home to Cox I kept getting extended period's of  
almost 100% packet loss, just enough packets got through to keep me alive 
and edible in the game.  When I got eaten by a wyvern in CS during one of 
these I gated to FV, got 100 plat out, and offered to pay for a rez.  
Monual came, rezz'ed me, and refused to take anything for it.  The constant 
fighting with the connection problems (fixed now) and then dying when I 
have limited time to play had me thinking about packing it in and quitting.  
Monual being so helpful is the reason I'm still playing.  Thanks man.
