>Anyone care to enlighten me on where they can be found?

From www.graffe.com:
After this morning's patch, these spells have been added for sale in
Shadow Haven.

Vendor: Goesl Sealsonich
Loc: 1370 -600

But they only work IN LUCLIN.

You gotta take the spires up before you can use em, you cant just gate
from wherever to the Nexus.

Lame.

On the cool side, it looks like those of us who were granted the Title
'of the Nexus' can gate there from anywhere using the Propylon.
