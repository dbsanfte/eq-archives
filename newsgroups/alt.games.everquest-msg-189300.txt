That's not even a legit tactic on the PvP servers, except for Sullon
Zek. That's not to say it isn't common on the other Zeks; from what
I've heard it is, but it is a violation of the rules.

There is a rule. People can get suspended or banned over it, but since
it's very hard to prove training is intentional, that's not very
common, unless they're stupid enough to brag about it in game.
