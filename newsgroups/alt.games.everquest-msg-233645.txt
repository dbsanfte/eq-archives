But the FD/Stun gives you a real problem to deal with... TZ is about 1 thing
only, heal power.  No strat, no crazy ideas (friend in a rival guild was
stuck on VZ for quite some time -- some of their ideas were pretty far out
there)

Just keep a tight chain, manage agro, and TZ goes down.   I don't recall the
last time we had a death on TZ (and were pretty sloppy at times..) and the
last 2 months at least, he's died first time flawlessly, so fast that we
have VZ and TZ corpses stacked together

Didnt you try Bert?  He's even easier than CT! =)

In that case, and im trying to not totally spoil the encounter =p... you
will see what I meant at some point, when you progress a bit more on RZ =p

Btw another reason he dies slowly, is the adds spawn much more often than
the other gods, and I assume you take all dps off RZ onto adds
