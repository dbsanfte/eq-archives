Aye, some damage, but I'm specifically objecting to the word
"primary".  In a group of 6, if the guy who is taking most of the
damage is also the guy dishing out most of the damage, you have
one messed up group.  Even if you have 6 identically geared SK or
Paladins, the one who is sponging should be doing only about 85%
of the damage the people positioned behind the mob are, due to
parry, block, dodge and our old friend, riposte

Not Clerics, healers.  Healers do indeed help you move faster
than a group with no healers.  But clerics, specifically?  They
don't speed things up all that much versus druids or shamen.

I've seen a wide variety of strategies for the missions, mezzing
is only one of them.  But I already surrendered the CC point.  I
suppose mana regen replacement for wipes is handy, but wipes
aren't a very good strategy as a rule.

While succoring to zone safe point is a fine idea, I can't see
how "porting to locations" means that.  For wizards they say
something that does suggest it, but I think you just thought that
when you read it for druids because it makes sense, while what
they said doesn't.  I've yet to see a battle in LDoN where DS
seemed to matter, and thats running my 36/36/38 mage around in
them, which means mobs with relatively small HP totals and the
class with the best DS in the game.

Bah, its semantics to say you can't port from somewhere without
porting to somewhere.  If you are in a big pile of danger, you
port From it, and where you go isn't really all that important. 
If you are somewhere safe and want to go somewhere closer to
somewhere dangerous, then you port TO it, and where you come from
isn't all that important.  I'm happy to agree that wizards are
great at damage... but they said that your main tank was your
primary damage producer!

To me, no, haste is no mere buff.  Debuffs on boss mobs, perhaps,
but they seemed to be thinking of the grind, which is how I think
of most of LDoN: even the boss mobs aren't that much bigger than
the little guys though, the key is chewing them up fast.  Shaman
heals are more than adequate for healing during LDoN IMO, but
they don't mention shaman as healers at all; apparantly ONLY
clerics can heal (if thats what they mean by making groups move
quickly... otherwise they don't mention healing at all)

I'm not objecting to including any of the above classes, mind
you, I'm objecting to the clueless interpretation that the prima
guide gives to what is important about each in an LDoN
environment.
