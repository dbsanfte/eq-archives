"Quite a while" is a relative thing.  In this case, they went at least
three weeks that they knew about it without saying anything, letting
people spend lots of plat on horses based on this property of horses.
Why couldn't they post a message saying that this property of horses
was a bug that would be fixed in a later patch?  I'd say three weeks
is quite a while when you have a "bug" that is widely known, that is
being used by players, that players have no reason to believe is a
bug, that will really piss off those players when it is fixed, that is
trivial for Verant to verify (note that I'm not saying "for Verant to
find"...this one was called to their attention by players almost as
soon as Luclin came out), and that could be listed as a bug by Verant
without compromising the game.
