As I understand it they have at least 2 major sites and its perfectly
possible you can reach one and not the other as they're routed differently.

Also they have multiple incoming pipes to the site and if you are routed
over a "broken" one you may not be able to reach a server that others can
just fine if they come in a "working" one.

At least, thats how it was explained to me in chat ;)
