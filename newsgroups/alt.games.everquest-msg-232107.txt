Like the other posters said.
A small explanation of how to read the lucy code:

1: Increase Spell Haste by 33%
the effect. yuy.

2: Limit: Max Level(65)
Great, works for all spells.

3: Limit: Min Duration(30.00 sec)
Oh only duration spells. That limits it to: buffs, debuffs, dots (damage
over time) and hot (heal over time)

4: Limit: Min Casting Time(3.00 sec)
Not really fast spells then.

5: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)
Ah another limit to the type. Only debuffs, nukes and dot's allowed here.

6: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)
Shees another restriction. only damaging or healing spells are allowed with
this one. That means: heals, nukes, dots and hots. Taking the other 2 limits
into account all you are left with is: dots.


It takes a bit of practice, but once you can read the lucy code it all makes
sense :).
