The 39 song doesn't work on mobs higher than *51*. That said, I charm kite
all the time at 58 and climbing, and folks doing swarming use it up to
around 62 I believe.

xp on 51 mobs is stinky at my level if you don't get quanity, but I usually
charm a 48-51 onto a 54-56 if I can find the pairing right. With me chanting
the higher target, it turns into a loosely even fight, and I eventually
while up with just two mobs that I don't have that much left to chant down
on. This paring will get me ~2% per pull. Two of the lower mobs get me < 1%.

Swarmers take the 51 and the lesser xp of them, but mow through them so fast
that the total is quite good.

Now, as to the "lvl 60 Bard speed group song" - I'm confused on that one.
All of our speed songs are group songs, and the last one comes at 51. The
only thing I can think of is that you saw the haste we get there and
misunderstood. We get two overhastes at 60, although I would only consider
one of them of use (Vah Shir) - it increases ATTACK speed by 25%, but does
not affect run speed at all. For running, you max the level effect of that
around 47 or so - after that it's all about the mod on the drum. If you have
Drums of the March, then you're pretty much at cap (within 3% of it), and
anything with a higher mod than that and you're at the cap.
