Mine is for beastlords (at least beastlords on PvP servers) to get root
spells.  See... against mobs beastlords are quite effective... the pet
taunts the mob and the mob attacks the pet and as long as you don't get too
low on hp or piss the mob off too much he'll leave you alone to do casting
or melee, whichever is more convenient at the time, and he'll die easily and
very nicely.  Whereas if you happen to be fighting a player, who's
intelligent enough to realize that if you die, pet dies, and that with you
casting buffs and healing spells on your pet from a safe distance, the pet
will be inconveiently slow to die, you'll always find yourself, instead of
your pet, fighting the player.  This makes you very easy to kill.  Which I
find annoying.  So... if Sony were to perhaps weaken the beastlords on PvP
servers in some other way but give them root spells, I would be quite
pleased.  Of course... how often does Sony do what we want them to do?  Not
often...

(for goodness sake, Sony, please take this post as a serious request)
