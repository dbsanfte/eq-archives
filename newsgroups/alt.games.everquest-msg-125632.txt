Speaking from a druid point of view, if you want to lose agro, the LAST
thing you want to do is snare it.  ONE snare can out-taunt 15 melees beating
on something for 15 seconds prior to snare.  Also, as I recall, bard snare
has a slow component, which would also cause a lot of agro, from a
shaman/enchanter point of view.  I've never played a bard past 6, so, I'm
not really in on the special abilities of the class, other than that bards
can cast (eg click effects) while running.
