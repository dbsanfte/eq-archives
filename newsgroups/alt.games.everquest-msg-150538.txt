Sounds a lot like a character that joined my former guild a while back.  He
came and joined the guild and within an hour was asking to go on a raid that
very minute.  When I told him that the majority of raids were the result of
planning if you wanted them to be effective he began with the next thing
which was....Lets start a guild war.  I explained that first of all only the
guild officers and leaders could do that and second as a rule this
particular guild does not do that under any circumstances.  Then began the I
am going to kill myself.... I am going to disband... blah blah blah.  I
agree with the fact that people catch onto the power of that statement and
use it to get what they want.  I hope it all works out in the end.
