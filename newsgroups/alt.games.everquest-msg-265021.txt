But the zone files will be there regardless of its current state. That
is the important thing. The zone is always flipping back and forth
without Dev assistance on Test. Sometimes when the server comes up,
its the old way, sometimes its the new way.

I don't think your right about the script either, for that matter.

Its not all that hard to save a file. Why would they delete them? How
about to avoid accidently changing the zone back without meaning to?

And why would they need to be doing that?

These were rhetorical questions, which makes answering them rather
pointless. I already know why the original files are still on there -
because they never thought to move them - and why they were mucking
around with it in the first place.
