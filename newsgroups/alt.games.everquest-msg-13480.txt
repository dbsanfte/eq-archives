The difference is, in EQ, what is left in your "wallet" might not be yours.
That, and access to your "wallet" may have been passed around quite a bit,
so others might get in. When your car is seized because it was used for a
crime, your stuff isn't returned, whether you had something to do with it or
not.

When you get your wallet back, you don't get your $100 ... but there's
nothing else you can do with that wallet but put a brand new $100 in it.

If the "cops," i.e., Verant, gave you your $100 back, how easy would it be
to say your had "X, Y, and Z," please ensure my new account has it, rinse
and repeat. "Hey, some guy stole my DeathMonstrositySlayer!!! Give it to my
new account!"
