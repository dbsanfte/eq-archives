I like LDoN. I keep thinking perhaps LDoN's should have respawn like
regular zones.  To crawl would be the only way to finish collections
or kill X number of mobs in time to win. There should be very little
respawn along the npc's path in a rescue mission so they are much like
they are presently, whereas assassinations could have more respawn
(and more points and more loot).
