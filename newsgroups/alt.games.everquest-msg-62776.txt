  Thanks, it worked fine. :)  I thought that if I ran out of stamina, I'd
all the sudden be unable to move, and would sink to the bottom of the ocean
like an anchor and drown.  Turns out you don't need stamina to swim.

  And, for the record, the fall was 101 points of damage for me. :)  Which I
handled without a problem.

  Oh, and what does YMMV mean..?
