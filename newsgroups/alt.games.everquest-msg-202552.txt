Um, my 24 druid solos reds, and, he is half naked.  He has a few items I 
passed on to him, but nothing that would not be level appropriate.  Heck, 
he's wielding a Coldain Velium Scimitar for a weapon still.  He manages 
this without KEI, without other than self buffs.  At that level, it's 
really not that much of an accomplishment for some classes.
