True, for the second figure on each row.  But it's still a handy figure to 
consider when you're deciding whether you want your group of n to become a 
group of n+1.  In proportion, assuming a reasonably middle of the range 
level, if you go from 3 to 4 you're getting about 8% less exp per kill, so 
it's worthwhile if having a 4th person raises your kill rate by about 8%.

Of course, if there were no group bonus, the comparison would be 
33.3%-25% = 8.3%.  Ooh.  thank goodness for the group bonus. :)

Summary:  Yes.  There is a group bonus.  But it doesn't really make a hell 
of a lot of difference...
