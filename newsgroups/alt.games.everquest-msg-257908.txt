The trick is that the damage is 'unattributed' from the damage shield. 
Means (as far as the game is concerned) noone did it. So the lower level 
player must do more damage than the druid, not counting whatever the 
damage shield did.

Undead are good for powerleveling. Lil buddy goes out and gets a 
handfull, you keep him alive while he targets and does at least one 
point to each one, and they eat themselves on the damage shield. Undead 
don't run (generally).

Another way I have powerleveled (MUCH) lower level people with a druid 
(guy wanted to keep his weaponskills up):
Snare target.
Make sure my DS is up.
Let it get to point blank, let the beatings begin.
Lil buddy beats on mob while mob beats on me, I keep snaring.
Mob turns to run (snare stopped) let little buddy finish him while I go 
get something else.
