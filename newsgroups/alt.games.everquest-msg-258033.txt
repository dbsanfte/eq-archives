I think I'm about to ask a really stupid question. :-)

Last night I happened to be using a third-person camera to watch
my druid fighting something.  As the mob got low, I cast Snare.
Watching the casting animation, I noticed how it interfered with
the melee animation.  And for the first time, I realised that it
could well be more than just the animation.  So I went back over
my logs, and sure enough, it looks like I never have any melee
attacks go off -- neither hits nor misses -- while casting.

This makes perfect sense from a "realism" perspective, but I don't
remember ever seeing anything in the game Help, or tutorial, or
even on this newsgroup! that bothered to mention that casting
spells might mean fewer melee attacks.

Even now, I'm not sure what the effect is.  I.e., is the time
spent casting considered "dead time" on the melee timer, so if
I spend 3 seconds casting a spell my next melee attack will fire
off 3 seconds later than it would've otherwise?  Or is that a
melee attack is cancelled if it tries to occur in the middle of
a spell, so a 1-second spell could cost me an entire melee cycle
if the timing hits just wrong?  Or perhaps it's that a spell
doesn't interfere with melee if the entire casting time falls
between two melee swings (but if it does interfere, then what?).

If it's one of the last two cases, that might be a reason to use
a slower weapon, so that melee strikes are less likely to try to
fire off in mid-spell.  And in any case, it's a reason not to
just casually try casting lightning bolts or whatever while
meleeing, figuring if they go off, great, and if I'm interrupted
there's no harm done (except for the occasional fizzle); if the
casting is reducing my melee DPS then I must rethink my tactics.

Heck, for all I know, just attempting to cast a spell is making
me easier to hit, too!  How the heck can I tell?

Or am I just wrong and melee and casting don't really interact?
