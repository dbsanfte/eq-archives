Great damage? Archery is inferior to every other class doing damage by
the time you are getting elemental weapons, except perhaps paladins,
and even then, they will soon pass it. And there aren't that many
ranged-only fights.


>And I use my buffs a lot in *groups*,not only SoP and CoR.

They aren't good enough to make ranger something you want over someone
else.


>And what about the walk in the park that was the levels 1 to 56 ?

You mean the walk in the park it is for every class? Give me a break.
My paladin on FV I've been screwing around with lately is L27 with
half a day /played and I suspect will be L50 before hitting two, and
thats while leveling two characters at once. I could do the same with
any class, solo. So piss on that.


>What about solo capabilities ? I feel with the warriors!

Warriors don't need to solo, they're wanted in groups. Rangers can
solo at high levels, sure, as long as you don't mind an exp rate app.
a sixth that of a plain old earth group at *best* (at tables). Who's
kidding who?


>And try to ask a Cleric,what he thinks about an AA like Innate
>Camouflage.

A cleric doesn't get invis ever. Rangers aren't asking for abilities
they don't have, they are asking for the ones they do have to be
acceptably balanced.

If you think being at the bottom of the barrel in so many ways is
"convenience" then more power to you.
