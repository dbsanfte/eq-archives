A friend and I took the time to master all the languages, and I have since 
taught at least 3 other people all of them.  One of them was a high level 
enchanter who was trying to max every skill he could.  Now, he is a good 
friend and does me favors any time I want them, and I help him with 
anything I can.  It was a nice trade.
