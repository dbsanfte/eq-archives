No.  Druids are awesome for soloing

They are versatile on raids.. thats what the group is about.
They can nuke, they can buff, they can debuff, they can heal, they can dot,
they can snare..  all that versatility is the price they pay for supposedly
not excelling in any 1 area (tho id hardly say they are lacking in the
nuking and doting category)

> Shamans are essential for raids, OK for groups, OK for soloing.

Shamans are essential for "some" raids.  Some raids you wouldn't notice the
difference between having 0 shamans and 5 shamans..

agree.  i guess they dont need to worry about finding torpor now.. who would
want a snaring, slowing heal over time that doesn't stack with other heals
over time, when they can now just instantly heal more the hp

You don't need to worry.. your role in a top guild will never change, as a
cleric.
But I sure do feel for all those young aspiring clerics, and I thank my
lucky stars that the cleric isn't my main
