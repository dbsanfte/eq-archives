Thanks for the helpful replies (Ben I can ignore).   Since I was only lvl28
at the time, I was definitely NOT quadding.  And one of the guys that stole
my kill was a lvl50+ so I could NOT outdamage him.  And I was NOT training
them past anyone.  These were other players looking for mammoths also.  I do
the root-rot method also but that seems to take a long time.  Here is what I
was doing:

Snare, DOT, run ahead (this is where the KS usually comes in), root.  When
root breaks, Fear and attack.

I can understand someone mistakenly attacking my MOB, but when I tell them
I'm kiting it and they won't back off...that's when I get mad.  Oh well,
guess that's part of the game.  Now that my druid is lvl29 and can
port...I'm keeping a list of those people <g>.
