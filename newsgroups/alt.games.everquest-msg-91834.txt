It would be nice for wizards to get this, but imo wizards get enough
already. If there is any balancing needed, its at the low levels for
wizards. High level wizards have it easy enough already imo with aoe groups
and quad kiting. Bards, druids and rangers could do with some unnerfing at
high levels (and perhaps some nerfing at lower levels, especially druids)
