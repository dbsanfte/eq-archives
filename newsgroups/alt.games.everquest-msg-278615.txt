Slayer is 5,000 kills.  Destroyer is 10,000 kills.

Slayer is kind of easy depending on how you do it.  The BBC quest
requires you to kill 1,000 'sentinent' beings before you can go back
home.  It took me under two hours to rip through them with a friend
(orcs in this case).

Sitting down to do them all at once might take awhile and be incredibly
dull.  Doing them over the course of awhile because of quests you
probably won't even notice.
