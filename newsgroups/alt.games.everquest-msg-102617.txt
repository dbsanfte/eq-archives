They won't put warning labels on cards because cards are played by "normal"
people.  Same reason 10 years ago if you played baseball for 4 hours a day
you were a "normal" kid but if you played on your Nintendo for 4 hours a day
you were seen as some kind of anti-social wierdo.  Case in point, my
girlfriend thinks I'm wierd if I spend a few hours a night playing EQ, but
if I have a 12 hour poker marathon, that's just fine.  Anything seen as
abnormal in any way, shape, or form just makes itself an easier target for
bottom-feeding lawyers, and money-hungry opportunists, and people seeking
something to blame to relieve them from their own responsibility.
