Well, infurating as it may be for a results-oriented kind of person,
information management is almost down to a fine art in the field of game
design. For the *average* player, there is a fine line between too
little information and too much, and what kinds of information should be
ambiguous and what kinds should be numeric. I agree with the previous
post that the only reason they added the numeric counter for skills over
100 is that they couldn't come up with enough descriptive names above
"master".

Frankly, no matter how strongly you feel about this particular subject,
you must admit that the fact that you have been playing (and, hopefully,
enjoying) the game for this long is an indicator that the Verant game
designers are anything but stupid.
