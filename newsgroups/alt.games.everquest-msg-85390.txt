Twink = Slang, derogatory (US English)... refers to the younger of a
male-homosexual couple. Implies that the only reason for maintaining the
relationship is to benefit financially/materially from gifts given by older
partner.

Twinking = giving or recieving money or equipment from higher level friends
or higher level characters owned by same player (on the same or multiple
accounts).

also called 'tweeking' (possibly to avoid the anti-homosexual overtones)

There's a few good sites out there that explain some of the more obscure
terms and phrases you might come accross while playing EQ... and being from
UK and trying to understand American slang isn't easy ;o)

My personal choice is... http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm
