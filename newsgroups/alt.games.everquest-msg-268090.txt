Here is the control message received at my news server, apparently
meant as a jab at you. Nevertheless, this will get it added on servers 
which blindly accept newgroups for alt.*. Admins who review the alt 
newgroup requests are probably going to ignore it (unless they are 
familiar with EQ2). There is no reason you can't post or have someone 
post a control message with proper charter later on, of course.
