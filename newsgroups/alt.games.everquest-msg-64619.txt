I chose to not upgrade the newest Luclin updated textures, but use the old
ones.  So I only installed luclin, but with no textures at all.  it didn't
install that good, so I went and installed the old textures.  Then after
trying to make sure it installed correctly by going over it several times, I
ran the path up to the point of it saying 40 to 56 hours.  I was like I
don't think so.  I mean why did I buy the luclin expansion to patch for that
long.  This isn't AO.   So I went and uninstalled luclin, and then
reinstalled, using the newest textures.  Patching was thus reduced down to
only 3 hours.  much much more reasonable.

Basically if you don't wanna DL for 40 to 50 hours, best to go and buy
luclin to save yourself the patching.  If you did buy Luclin, best to
install it correctly so you don't have to patch files already on your disks.
