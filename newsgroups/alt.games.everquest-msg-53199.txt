No one has said you HAVE to go on Kael raids to get to non-KoS, it's just a
whole lot easier. I also got all my CoV faction hits without going on Kael
raids, but that was a matter of circumstance rather than choice (i.e. my
guild wasn't capable of raiding Kael at the time).

I don't remember the exact figures but I think it took me about 300-400
frost giant kills in GD and EW to get to dubious with CoV. I currently have
over 750+ CoV faction hits from quests and kills and I'm only just amiable.

A couple of weeks hunting frost giants (which aren't great exp or loot for
their level), or a couple of Kael raids? Let me think... :)
