Ben, 

Seen lots of posts - people talk about zones as grids (which is true)
- but didnt see anyone tell you how to navigate with them using /loc
(I have not read all responses).

If you did a /loc when you were dying then that will be where your
corpse is - go to zone and type /loc again - it will be in form 

xxxx, yyyy, zzzz, 

Where all numbers can be positive or negative, for oasis you can
forget zzzz co-ordinates as it is the height co-ordinate and oasis is
an open plane (it has hills but not layers - so you cant be on the
wrong "floor").

So, to get from your location to your corpse.

If you want xxxx to be higher - run north and yyyy will stay the same.
If you want xxxx to be lower  - run south and yyyy will stay the same
If you want yyyy to be higher - run west and xxxx will stay the same
If you want yyyy to be lower - run east and xxxx will stay the same.

When you get better at it - you can mix i.e.

Run NE for xxxx up and yyyy down
Run SE for xxxx down and yyyy down
Run SW for xxxx down and yyyy up 
Run NW for xxxx up and yyyy up

Anyway - I am sure you get the gist of it

HTH 
Cheers
