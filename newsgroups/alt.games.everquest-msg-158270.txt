You can even get a peridot ;)

I did it with three old pieces of banked verm, glad I saved those ;)
I got:

1 blue diamond
1 diamond
1 raw diamond (thought to be some new POP tradeskill gem maybe?) 

so did not do that badly. The type, guildmaster or slot old plane
armor it is has nothing to do with the reward. Its just a random roll
for which one you get, evidently.  BD's are probably a rare since very
popular, peridots also seem kind of rare as the booby prize from what
I've heard.
