This is a major statement in support of my position. Witchcraft is not
the same thing as Wicca. One way to put it is that while all Wiccans
are witches, not all witches are Wiccans - and even that isn't really
quite correct.

Wicca, again, is a religion. Witchcraft is the practice of magick. It
is entirely possible to practice the religion without performing
magick.

Further, as your quoted material shows, Gardner et al drew on Kabbalah
for *inspiration*. Wicca is not based on Kabbalah - some rituals of
witchcraft borrow ritual elements of ceremonial magic.

You're the Tarot expert so I won't debate that point - I've only just
scratched the surface of that practice. 

But surely you see how the statements "Tarot is inextricably
intertwined with Qabalism" and "Many Wiccans are interested in the
Tarot" don't result in the conclusion "The Tetragrammaton is familiar
to all Wiccans".

Wiccans as a rule tend to be open to and interested in things occult,
so it's no surprise that many have knowledge of the Kabalah. It's a
parallel relationship, however, not a dependent one.
