Lighstones work well for indoor places in outdoor zones, for example the
entrances to thurg or kael(from ew) are very dark. They suck tho in most
situations, as youve found out. The best option is probably buy a
infravision item in bazaar. Glowing stone band or crown of king tranix are a
couple I know of. If you're a rogue or bard you have the dark elf mask in
lower guk as an option too, but you need to camp that yourself as its
nodrop.
