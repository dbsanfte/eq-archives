My, my... all of these interesting posts from last night. People busily
checking the status of EQLive, and the login server, and reporting back
here, seemingly for hours on end.

OT: There was a two hour show on the Discovery Channel last night called
"Engineering the Impossible". It dealt with in-development engineering
projects for things that look, on the face of it, to be impossible. One
was a tower to be constructed in Hong Kong harbour, called the Millenium
Tower. It's to be over 1/2 mile tall, and hold over 100,000 people for
living, business, entertainment, shopping, et. al.

The second was a "floating city"... a ship nearly a mile long with a
fully functional jet airport on top of it and carrying over 50,000
people who live there. The last was the plans for a bridge to link
Europe and Africa over the Straights of Gibralter. It was fascinating,
and I overslept this morning because I stayed up too late watching it.
(/em yawns)

You'd be shocked. When VI is busy patching and fixing things, you never
know what you'll find to amuse yourself. Give it a go!
