    Thanks for that input - I'm always keen to hear what other people see at
their stage of the game.

    you're probably right about PoV although I never would have let a 55
join my group when I was there - I couldn't tank worth a damn until 62 and
had to build groups from scratch in any case.

    Nowadays for LDoN's we either have a chanter and do a hard, or we need 2
tanks and 2 healers and do a hard, or we don't have either of those and chew
through a normal so fast and so casually you wonder why we bothered.

    And there are two zones - Vxed and Tipt, that I don't enter without a
chanter willing to charm in the group.

Cheers,
James
