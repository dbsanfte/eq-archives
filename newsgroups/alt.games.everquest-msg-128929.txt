Disorganized, but effective, and powerful. :-).

There's an interesting book by Ivan Stang (one of the people behind the
Church of the SubGenius) called "High Weirdness by Mail", which is basically
a collection of descriptions of weird organizations that you can write to
for free or cheap literature, organized into categories, such as weird
religion, weird politics, hate groups, etc.

A coworker decided to write to many of the groups listed, including the
Wiccans.  He used a post office box address, and gave no other identifying
information.  So, as expected, he received literature from these various
groups at that post office box.  However, he *also* received a phone call,
at home, on his unlisted number, a couple of weeks later, from the Wiccans,
asking if he'd received the literature they'd sent.
