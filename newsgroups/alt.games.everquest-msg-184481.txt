> Insanity:

How did he do it?

He has an Offense skill of 177, but no weapon skills at all (1HB of 5
doesn't count)  How does that happen?

He had to kill things somehow, even being PL'd but could a cleric do it just
with magic attack skills? Evocation is the only one thats decent, but even
that is not that high for a 65th level char.

How do you think this was done?  Maybe they just parked him in a group and
let him soak up exp?
