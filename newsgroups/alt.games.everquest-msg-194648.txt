You'd be assuming wrong. Disease based slows are pretty much
worthless, as has been pointed out. Before PoP, there were a very few
boss mobs that were immune to regular slow but could be hit with the
disease based ones, can't thikn of any off hand. Also one type of mob
(glimmer drakes?) in Halls of Testing that one would use the disease
based slows on. But back then disease slow was only 25% which is
hardly gamebreaking. With PoP, they came out with a 40% version but
since they added slow mitigation at the same time the idea of mobs
that could be slowed only with the Grummus line kinda fell by the
wayside. Any PoP mobs out there that you need Grummus for? Now if they
have a mob that they don't want slowed all the way, it seems that
they'll just flag it as partial.
