    You can petition the GMs to force the shammy to share the spawn with
you. You cannot force the shaman to leave with a petition. This is such an
example of bottom feeding, though, that were I you I might start asking a
number of players around the shammy's level if they knew her, and knew that
she needed cash so badly she was farming GLSs. That would get her a few
"/tell Shammy LOL, wisps?!?!? U sux!" and would likely be more effective in
getting her to leave.
