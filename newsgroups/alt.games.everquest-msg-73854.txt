At level 11, I'm guessing AC *is* pretty much everything, given his
budget. I'm still balancing AC vs. stats vs. resists vs. effects at
44, but I have the money to play with.

YMMV - 19 AC (Rygorr) to 25 AC (Treeweave) on the chest cost me 1.5k;
10AC and stats on the waist (Spider fur) vs. a FBSS would still cost
me over 4k on The Rathe (and darn those cats in Stonebrunt for giving
me yet another unwanted headband instead of the free haste belt I
wanted. Darn them to heck!)
