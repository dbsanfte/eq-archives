This is true, and the chanter might not be otherwise busy... or he might
be busier than a one handed man in a chainsaw juggling contest.  On the
other hand, the paladin is pretty much guaranteed to have the offending
mob targetted and be paying attention to little else, and to be in hearing
range of the "begins to cast a spell" message.

As I say, I've memmed stun a great deal as a cleric... and I find paladins
are certainly better at that job than I am, I'm never busier than a two handed
man at a chainsaw juggling contest... but thats plenty busy enough for me
to miss a spell here and there.

Paladins can also stop a great many other spells, AE, slows, DoTs,
so on, spending a lot less mana (and relatively unimportant mana) on
this than the cleric would spend on repairing the damage.  While a chanter
and cleric might see such prevention as too much to keep up with,
paladins are in a perfect position to deal with

You've said that your guild only has one cleric and two bot clerics, you
certainly don't seem to have a battlecleric lunatic handy.  Is he maxed out
on offense and 1hb and conjuration?  Does he have a str over 150?  How
about his dex, is that over 200 self buffed?  Bash skill any good?  The
vast majority of clerics ignored all melee factors since their low teens,
and aren't worth much more than a melee wizard in a fight.

Still, I expect a cleric will be outdamaged by a paladin of the same
level and equippage, particularly when you subtract out the pet and
MoR damage, which is why I said "via melee"

One thing a cleric has is an uber hammer, since the thing is store bought
for 6pp.  While I was once proud of my Righteousness and Cudgel,
I now use the cheap ass summon cause it seems to blow away all my
uber loot.
