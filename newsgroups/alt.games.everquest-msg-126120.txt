I have noticed that if I use my cancel magic song on myself, it will
strip buffs starting at the bottom and working up.  I have noticed
that mobs that dispell generally start at the bottom and work up.  
The theory that fits what I observe is that dispelling mobs have the
ability to dispell several buffs at one time.  (Which is easily
verified, get loaded with buffs, go to Skyfire, pull chromos, watch
your buffs fall off several at a time.)  When a mob casts a dispell on
you, assume that it affects 4 buffs.  Each buff it hits does a resist
check.  So your first buff may resist the dispell, then the other 3
don't, which leads to an odd situation where you have buff in slot 1,
nothing in slots 2-4, and you scratching your head wondering how that
happened.
