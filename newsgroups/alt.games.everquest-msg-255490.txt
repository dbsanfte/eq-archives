First things first, went to Abysmal Sea, found the tailoring quest 
person, and ran the simple tailor quest.  Man is this a stupid quest; 
you get supplies for 20 tries at the first step, do the combines, hand 
the lady the results, ask again and get another 20, repeat.  Till you 
trivial the task?  No, no, thats the stupid part... till you make 100 of 
the item.  Once you've handed her 100, the next time you ask her for her 
chores you get 20 sets of parts for the next task... and have to hand in 
100.  First task went trivial at around my 60th attempt, which was at 
around 40 of the part she wanted.  Second one has a much shorter trivial 
increase; first one was 31, second was 38... even with my terrible 
wis/int I'd picked up that 38 points by the time I was done with the 
first stack of combines.  Making 100 of the things took around 160 
attempts.  Then I had to do the same thing a third time... and a fourth 
time, but this time I stopped when I capped out at 54 skill.  Apparantly 
   I'll be given some sort of recipee for GOD stuff if I finish out the 
4th set of 100, but I don't see any point to that at the moment.

Then I went to POK to an alchemy dealer and bought Mandrake Roots, 
combined them in pairs till my skill hit 66.  I can't believe its 
possible to get tailoring to 66 without a single drop in under a half 
hour these days.

Went to Iceclad, started killing cougars.  Killed lots and lots of 
cougars.  Moved to the TOFS island when a bard started taking every 
single cougar off the igloo island, killed at least 50 more cougars 
along with assorted dervishes.  Killed Midnight, always fun as a break 
from those snow white cats, even though his Bloodstained Fang is now 
sadly outdated and his drop for the Garou Bone Club is a tease as the 
other mob for it is a very rare pop.  He too had a LQ pelt.

Finally ran over to Bazaar and picked up two HQ pelts for 5pp each, from 
a guy who had 23, and there were eight or nine other vendors also 
selling HQ cougar in large quantity.  Someone said that the HQ pelts 
only drop in EW; I could have sworn I'd gotten HQ pelts in SOV way back 
as early as the first day of SOV release, back when we had no clue what 
the things were for.

I'd actually killed quite a few snow cougars in EW as well, no luck 
there either, and the snow dervish adds were a lot more annoying than in 
iceclad.  Oh well.

HQ kodiak pelts were another story.  One guy selling, for 25Kpp each. 
Sent him a tell in case it was a mistake, went hunting in Gunthak for 
exp for a level.  Finally got a tell from him, he put that price on 
because he wanted to maybe use them himself, but wouldn't mind if he 
made a fortune.  My offer of 50pp each wasn't in his ballpark.

This morning, one HQ kodiak in bazaar for 25pp.  Went to EW, found a 
Tundra Kodiak over near the GD line, killed him, HQ pelt, first kill of 
the day.

Ran to Garadain to make sure I had the parts list right... and then 
found I had shoved my cougar pelts in the bank at some point.  Bah.

Ran in to CC, aggroing the orcs in the fort on the way in, but I've done 
that run many times and wasn't worried... sure enough, didn't get hit 
once.  Inside, I took the safe way out and drank a cloudy potion, then 
ran to the pit, jumped down from ledge to ledge, taking a total of 204 
hp of damage, not bad for a class without safe fall.  Ran on in to the 
Coldstone bank, got my cougar pelts, then on down, killing off some 
terrors on the way, then up geonids, cherry picking the two named... its 
nice to be alone in CC, picked up nearly 400pp in gems to replace the 
one cloudy potion I took.  Back out to find Roderick and the Emmissary 
mysteriously missing, they were there when I went in.

Back over to Garadian, I tried the combine, succeded, handed him the 
blanket at Apprehensive (a bit concerned about that) and got the first 
ring. Still apprehensive.  Still dubious to giants, when I checked.

Got the blunt axe to hand to his nephew, but looking at that quest I 
dont' think I can solo it as a 42 berzerk, I'll wait till I have a 
friend or two on.

Honestly the ring is extremely lame at the moment, and probably for 
quite some time to come, I'm not even sure I'll be able to get it to a 
high enough level where its worth having.  But at least starting down 
the road is something to do other than just grind exp.

Grage, 42 Berzerk, Luclin
