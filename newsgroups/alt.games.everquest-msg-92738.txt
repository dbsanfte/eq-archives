Ok, don't EVER post such useful information again, you got it? I
completely rebought all my armor, getting at least the same AC better
in some cases and additional stat boosters besides and drooped my
weight by 10. Bah, sneak up and talk to them, the prices were good and
I got the enchanter spells for my friend and a black pearl for her to
use. 400pp less in my bank account after all was said and done and I
didn't visit but a few vendors in Shadow Haven. Sheeeze, I can't
afford any more good hints  ;-)

Big Thank You :-)
