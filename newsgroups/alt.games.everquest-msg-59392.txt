Ever come across people who use the "Montague method of posting"? 
(I wouldn't recommend a net search; last I heard was that their
website had a virus) 
The greatest long time annoyance poster in the other group I post to
uses that, swears by that, and trumpets it as THE clearest and most
consistent quoteing method, and even if he didn't consistently write
eloquently nonsensical diatribes, his quoting would drive you up the
wall.
Method?

<Poster 1's name>: "<random quote, hopefully by Poster 1 unless some
mixup with another poster has occured, maybe from the current thread
and maybe from something written 3 years ago>"

<Poster 2's name>: "<random quote, which might or might not be a
followup to what was said by Poster 1 as quoted above, and might or
might not have been written by Poster 2>"

<rambling reply to Poster 1 and 2>

<reference to something poster 3 said>:

<Poster 3's name>: "<random quote...>"


Cute, isn't it? Posters 1, 2, 3 and so on are usually referred to as
Nazis, Milosevic excusers, and/or Taliban supporters...
