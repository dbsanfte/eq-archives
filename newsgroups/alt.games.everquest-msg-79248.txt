	And what if it's true?

	The endgame is raid-oriented, and classes that don't work well on raids
are going to be marginalized when they hit high levels.  There is nothing to
be gained by saying it isn't so.

	I'm very happy your Druid is able to function well in some old-world zones
that aren't tuned to deal with level 60 characters in post-Velious equipment,
but that's really not what people are talking about when they address the
limitations of certain classes in the endgame.
