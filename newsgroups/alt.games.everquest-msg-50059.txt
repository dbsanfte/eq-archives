It also takes out the primary source of frustration in doing trade skills.
Mythic has already stated now new tradeskill items would be "found": under the
right circumstances (speaking with an NPC, completing a quest, etc) the new item
will show up in your tradeskill window. No more spending lots of time and plat
trying to find recipes that supposedly exist but don't (fleeting quivers, root
beer floats) or recipes that are just plain broken (imbued field plate boots.)

You "hail" an NPC by left clicking on them. If they have anything to say to you,
a window will pop up which may or may not have highlighted text. You can either
right click on the highlighted text or use the main chat window to type out
text. No need to find proper phrasing; if the key phrase is included, it will be
recognized. As an example, you can target an NPC and say "task" to get a small
job that gives good money and experience (they are level dependant, and you can
only do so many tasks per level.) You can just /say task, you can /whisper task
(/whisper allows the target to hear you without spamming the area) or you can
roleplay it: "I would be willing to do a task for you" will get the same
response as just "task". Which has some drawbacks when people are going "Give me
a friggin task!"

But be honest: NO ONE does quests completely "in-game" in Everquest, except for
a very few people and those almost always when new quests are just added (like
the fresh baked muffin and bread delivery quests when plague hit the Karanas, or
the Qeynos investigator badges.) Everyone after that just goes to a web site and
looks up the particulars, even to the point of gathering items and holding on to
them until they are able to complete the quest, or farming quest components (the
heads for the Red Headband come to mind) for sale. And do you really think
anyone who is working on an epic quest has NOT looked up every particular ahead
of time? DAoC quests are much, much less cookie-cutter than the quests in EQ.

No different than getting 3 bat wings or pickpocketing internal organs in EQ.

Not at all. DAoC is *realm vs realm*. Within your chosen realm (Hibernia,
Midguard or Albion), there ARE no enemies, except for the mobs.

While every class can solo (unlike EQ), there are many "nudges towards grouping"
in DAoC. Having a rez capable cleric is one of them. And the rez capable classes
(those that follow the Way of Nature in Hibernia; other realms have other
classes) start getting rez ability at level 10 or 12, which can be reached with
only a few hours of play.

Yup. The experience loss, thought, is a consistent percentage of how much
experience it takes to advance through the next level, unlike EQ where higher
levels means higher percentage loss.

Correct.

In Hibernia, Druids and apparently Bards (two of the three "specialty" classes
that follow the Way of Nature) get rez ability at level 10.

Total agreement.
