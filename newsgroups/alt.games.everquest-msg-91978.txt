At 35, Snow Cougars in Iceclad Ocean, or even the Dire Wolves there will
give you great exp.
If you hunt Cougars, set "base" next to the Gnome Igloos, right where the
boat arrives. NO WOLF FORM! :)
If you decide to go for Dire Wolves (better exp, but NO loot. Cougars drop
the occasional Cougar Claw Earring = app. 200-300 PP), I suggest you head
for the 3rd island; the one with the bridge to EW. Follow it along the
Eastern shore, and you will come across some small ice-"flakes" (in lack of
a better word), a few feet off the main island. Set "base" here, and pull
the Dire's from the island in that direction. Great for quadding, with no
adds, if you bring them all the way out to the ocean. Be on the lookout for
Snow Dervishes and Frost Giant Scouts, though. They CAN be rather irritating
adds.
