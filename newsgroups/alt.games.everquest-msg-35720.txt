Well, as you can see in my previous post, it's not really an issue anymore
anyway.  Anyone need to borrow my windows key removal utility?  The first
piece is a screwdriver, then next is about 10 pounds of grey fur, and the
third part is about 80 pounds of extremely friendly golden retriever.  It
works great, I have never had a problem of switching to windows since using
my kit.
