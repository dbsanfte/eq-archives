This was a favourite tactic to scam Wurmslayers, they used to be Giant sized
so most containers would not hold them and they never return to the
equipment slot so they dropped.

My favourite of these conversations (not really a scam tho)

player01 "Can I see your swords?"
mule "Sure" /cheer say waves his swords for all to see "there you go"
P01 "No, in a trade window"
mule "No, the stats are in my inspect text"
Annoying Git is looking at your equipment
P01 "they Suck"
mule "Yeah, style over substance"
P01 "You think they're uber or summin"
mule "hardly"
P01 "Then why wouldn't you put them in trade"
mule "They're not for sale"
P01 "you're a jerk"
mule "Thankyou"
P01 "n00b"
/me moves to second PC and adds name to druid's ignore list

The conversation as I remember it, there were many others like this from
people who didn't like me refusing to show another player my mule's swords.
Don't think any were trying to scam me...weapons weren't worth it but have
had a few that have done the step back routine to my primary, when I used to
be willing to put items of mine in trade windows.
