I believe killing the city giants is a guild raid level event.   46 minimum to
join the raiding party.   Or at least thats what our guild has been doing.  I
just barely got that high recently, so I don't know much beyond that.

In my opinion, only if you're doing it mostly for the experience, and if that
is the case you'd probably be better off going back to Kunark and fighting
mobs that have appropriate hit points and abilities for their level and loot
content.

Perhaps it was just me, but when myself and my druid partner tried to do the
Frost Giant Scouts in Iceclad, it was slow kills, lots of downtime and overall
crappy loot.
