use the air pet for stuns.  decreases DPS output of mob, usually
better than the added DS DPS.

A mage pet can usually tank effectively.  The problem will be pulls.
If you get more than one the pet is not very good at mitigation or
avoidance, it's just tough.  And the first time you heal a pet who
hasn;t been on a second mob...well, ranger-gate comes to mind.

A true tank would give two benefits as I see it.  1) a simple 2-box
combo (maybe not a big deal for you but it's all I can do to 2-box a
cleric and berserker) and 2) split pull capability if you go paladin
or sk.
