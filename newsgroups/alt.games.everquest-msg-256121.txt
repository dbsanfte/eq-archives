I'm a 65 Cleric and I bind right outside of nearly every LDoN
adventure (the exception being Everfrost where the soulbinder in the
Wayfarers camp is close enough to the dungeon entrance not to matter
much). Even normal LDoNs - who knows, anything can happen.

I used to urge all casters to do this. I have been known to say that
the only folks who get rezzes during the adventure are those that
cannot bind themselves. I still urge casters to bind nearby on hards.
