I started a Dark Elf Necro and was running around turning in my guild note,
learning the layout of Neriak etc.

Suddenly I get a tell - "Will you give a backpack to my other char?"

I said, "Sure"

I met a higher level char at the zone and she handed me a backpack. She then
logged. I glanced in the BP - to make sure I gave the other player the right
one - and saw some pretty amazing armor. I sat at the zone for about 5
minutes and finally get a tell from a level 1 warrior.

The Warrior comes and gets the backpack, says 'thanks' and runs off. I send
a tell that maybe they should bank it till they get to level 6, but get no
reply.

Anyway, I'm a nice, honest person and would never have done anything to
smear my DE Necro name, but I was still shocked that a stranger would trust
another stranger so quickly.

As sad as it sounds, it's the dishonest minority that causes these scams and
raises the paranoia levels of players to obsessive levels.

Just be careful and you'll be OK
