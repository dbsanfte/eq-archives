Just a few comments while I wait for the Nexus portal to bring me to
Dreadlands so I can do a CR in Chardok.

I've played my rogue to 60 (and within 9 blue of Baroness) and have to
say that it's my all-time favorite class in the game. Just to clear up
a few misconceptions:

(1) There are some places where find/remove traps are absolutely
critical: Two major spots in Ssra Temple, The Pit in Velk's,
Constructs in Dragon Necropolis all immediately come to mind.
Similarly, there are locked doors for the whole zone of Howling
Stones, the Crypt in OS, the Reavers in City of Mist, and Royals in
Chardok. 

(2) Bard tracking makes no sense to me, but neither does rogue
tracking.

(3) Melee upgrades were done first and rogues got a huge one. No one
does more damage per second than a high-level rogue. At 60, backstabs
range from 120 to 550 points, often doubling up, and more than 800
points with Duelist firing. That's mana free, constant, and rarely
creates more aggro than you can deal with through evade.

(4) Rogues are the worst soloists in the game. Period. Rogue tends to
mean "rulebreaker," not "soloist." OTOH, from 55 up, they tend to get
more tells for groups than any other class in the game.
