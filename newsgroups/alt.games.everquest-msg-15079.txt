Can't say I agree.  I like it with the simple message on/off.  I apologize
for any comparisons on this thread that I made between "inspecting" someone
here and in real life.  They were totally wrong and everyone else who is
doing it needs to stop also.  Doesn't anyone realize all our characters are
are polygons/pixels on a screen. :P  Real life analogies hold no weight
here.  In the end, it only comes down to a) a simple game function and b)
someone's opinion about whether or not someone being able to see what a
character possession is rude or not.  Talking about in real life checking
underwear tags or lifting robes is getting ridiculous now. ;)

It is also my finding that people mostly find it rude because then they get
asked for something afterwords.  I am only level 26 so maybe this is why,
but usually when I get inspected, I get offered stuff and never begged for
something.  Also upon discussing this with some higher level friends I have
met in game(who all have the feature turned on) agree that they get asked
much more often for things without even being inspected to begin with so
that will certainly not solve the problem, and it adds very little.

Also, I am sure many of the higher level players are often out doing raids
or hunting in high-level areas.  Tell me what newbie is going to be
inspecting you anyway?  If you sit in EC all day, you are asking for it
anyway and deserve it.  Although I'd have to say EC in this game is not as
bad as West Britain Bank in UO.  Now there were some scumbags..

Personally, I feel I have a right to inspect anyone I wish.  I would also
like to point out I never inspect anyone, I could care less what anyone has
no matter the level.  But yes, I will defend my right to inspect anyone I
choose if I decide I want to as long as I am doing it in a polite and
respectful manner (aka not begging or repeatedly doing it to scroll a
message and annoy the person).  Asking first is irrelevant.  If someone
abuses this "priviledge," then yes, I feel you as the victim have any right
to do what you please.  I believe this why many of you also have heated
opinions on the issue and are strongly against it... because of past
occurances.  But remember, one person is just an individual and take it out
on that particular player, not the feature.  Most people who use it do use
it honestly and are just curious.
