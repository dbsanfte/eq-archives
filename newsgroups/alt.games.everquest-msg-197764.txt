Here is a way to do it right, still works even in the AGe of KEI

Root and nuke, sit, when nuke is again avialable stand up nuke and
sit.
When mob breaks root, Tishan's clash works when available, and later
you will get bonds of force which give you more time to re-root.

Ad soon as you re root, nuke and sit.

The key is sit and keep your mana high. You DD output is strongly
dependent on the mana. No mana, absolutly NO damage, you have zero
DOTS.
