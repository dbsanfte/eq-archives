I've gone there at 54 and your enchanter definately needs to be 54 for
GoK, other mezes will most likely not land.  rooting may be an option. 
The stuff here also summons, at least some of it.  It's a tough zone. 
I'd say MINIMUM level of 54 for everyone, but we even had some 60's and
got party wiped once.  I'd actually NOT reccommend hanging around the
zone, it gets trained regularly.  Nice druid loot - sell it and buy some
real stuff.  XP is also good, but not PoP good.  You'd probably be
better off in many PoP zones.
