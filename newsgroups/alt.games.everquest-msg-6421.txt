What a coincidence!  I feel exactly the same way.  See we are 
practically friends already. :-)

Heehee I would assume you do have opinions other than Vanilla.  Let's 
face it vanilla is a pretty darned beautiful opinion about ice cream 
and stuff like that.  But, well it would really start to lose 
something on the topics of politics, religion...EQ... etc.  So no, 
actually there isn't a real surprise there.  In fact, to be blunt, 
unpredictability is no more your strong suit than clarity.  Oh 
speaking of clarity.  I really don't know why you take my opinion 
about your lack of clarity as an insult.  *I* never stated it as such 
and you obviously have chosen a style that you like.  So what's the 
problem?

You have kind of a thing going for Matt so you are rushing to champion 
him? :-)  That's adorable, but I think you're wasting your time.  He 
doesn't like you very much.

Crash told Matt that Matt's posts were nothing better than "Purina 
troll chow" now. I said that they were walmart brand.  That means in 
my opinion (there's that really cool word again) MATT'S posts of late 
have been not only pointless (troll chow) but of low quality (walmart 
brand).  Then Crash said that it should be the generic black and white 
instead of walmart.  Translation: MATT's posts, in Crash's opinion, 
(at least as he stated it) have been pointless and of very low 
quality.  It's so beautiful that you care so much about Matt. 
However, these are our opinions about Matt's posts of late and we're 
entitled to them.  He's entitled to think were wrong.  You're entitled 
to think we are wrong.    


Troll chow is given TO trolls, not received from them.  You are 
obviously  confusing Troll chow with Troll shit.  Its ok.  That 
happens a lot.
