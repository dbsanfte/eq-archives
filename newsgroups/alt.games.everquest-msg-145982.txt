As the second patch loomed, I realized my druid buddy might not be
back online when I was, so I moved up the hill in SF and bound myself there.

Logging back in, I went and hunted a bit, then used Faithstone to
Kaladim to drop spells in the bank and sell junk, then gated back
to hunt. In GD.  Cause they had rolled back the server to before
when I changed my bind spot!

Lesson (and one I know well, just occaisionally blip on like here) is
to always charinfo before I faithstone!
