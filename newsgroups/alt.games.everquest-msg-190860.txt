I am still very new to the game. I'm just in my 3d week of play. I
have opne Paladin on Bristlebane that is 6th level and my Druid on
Solusek is just 12th level.

I am a Ultima Online refugee and thus am fairly interestedin the way
TradeSkills are handled in this game. I've read a lot on several of
them (Fishing, Blacksmithing...) on Caster's Realm.

What I would like is to hear some of your thoughts on the skills. I'd
like some input as to which ones seem to be the best for
profitability, higher in demand, difficulty and whatever you feel
might be on help in my decisions in which ones I try out first.

Thanks in advance!!!
