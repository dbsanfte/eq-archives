Its funny you mention this.  I have a 60 mage on Mealin.. and when I
got to be 46 I went out to look up the Mage Epic.  What I decided.. it
was to darn hard.. and gave you somthing that time spent leveling
would more then likely give you.   

I also notice no one botters to MQ it.. and if / when you see the
Elemental Crown of Mastery in the bazaar your seeing it for about
140k.

Short Answer.. no.. Most mages choose to not bother with it unless
they are 65 and bored.


Side note.. on Monstor Summoning 2 or 3.  Very often he will be weaker
then your pet of the same level.  Other then simply having somthing
diffrent.. not sure how much I would sue that spell.

Ok I will admit being in PON a few nights back and seeing somone with
a mini Treant was funny (Yea Tiny Compaion.. for those that dont use
it.. DO).
