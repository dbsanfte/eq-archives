True but the rules should be internally consistent. Its obvious that
there is no atmosphere from the intro movie. Its obvious that some
force hold people on norrath, if that force isn't gravity then what is
it?  If it is then unless Luclin is the same mass as Norrath then the
gravity is gonna be less.  The atmosphere will be thinner and the days
brighter and climate have bigger extremes.   Etc etc. I don't want to
think about all that stuff.  It really doesn't matter though after I
saw the screenshots of the new and improved Gnomes, which a guildmate
of mine accurately described as an older Danny Devito, I have no
desire to see my favorite race look like that.  They totally removed
the childlike, mischievous aspect of the gnomes. Now they look like
grumpy old fat men,
