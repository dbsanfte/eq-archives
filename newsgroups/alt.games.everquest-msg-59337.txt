Buying the Trilogy pack is the best bet but I wouldnt worry about
pre-ordering Luclin yet.  If you are buying the game to check it out,
check it out... once we have you hooked, then order Luclin or buy it
then=)

One of the computer gaming mags (Computer Gaming Monthly I think it
was) for December had a trial version that gave you just the old world
for 10 days to try for free.  That is also a good way to look into it.
I know there was info on it at everquest.com as some of the trials
didnt have the trial codekey with them.
