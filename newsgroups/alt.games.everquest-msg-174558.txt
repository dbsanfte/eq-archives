Paladins have great aggro, if anything warriors suffer here, not
paladins.  The secret is Group Heals... POP mobs have an irrational hatred
of healers.  Have the cleric use Divine Arbitration at the top of each
wave, paladin does a Wave heal to patch up the damage, presto, No aggro on
healer, and Big aggro on pally. This also saves wear and tear on the
cleric's mana bar.  In addition, paladin's stun line makes another good
taunt, I've never heard anyone say a paladin has a hard time getting aggro
quick and holding it, even without the group heal trick.  Having paladin
LOH as backup emergency heal is handy, and I've even heard of a "barely
passed" group using the paladin rez to get someone their mark when the
cleric died.
