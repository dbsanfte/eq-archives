Same here.  Since my Magician is now high level enough to get Rings of
Flight, I can have levitate whenever I really need it, which is rare.  And
I do hate bobbing around like that.  It makes me ill, and since my computer
isn't the best in the universe, it messes up my frame rate when the entire
zone is moving up and down.  And I get annoyed by people who cast buffs on
me that I don't like, or don't want.  Clerics, for example, insist on
overwriting my Phantom armor, and then sit around whining that they're Oom
from buffing everyone.  I have my own armor buff, *and* it gives me regen. 
If I'm in a situation where I *really* need the extra few points of AC,
I'll let you know.  Since I'm not hunting in the planes yet, if I've
managed to get myself into a situation where the AC makes a difference,
I've either seriously screwed up (over nuked,) or I'm as good as dead
anyway (train.)
