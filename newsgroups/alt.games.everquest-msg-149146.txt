Kiting is possible at that level, but it takes a long time to kill a mob
sometimes. Just make sure you have your weapons hotkeyed and try to get a
sow if at all possible. It will be one less song you have to twist and one
more chance to do some damage. When you get your first fear song, you can
fear kite quite easily as long as you have your brass skill up. Brass is the
hardest skill to max. What is even more fun is charm kiting and I have found
that the higher the CHA the more effective your charm is. By the way, I love
how charm works since the patch.
