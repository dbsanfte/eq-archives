My Paladin's "diety", Mithaniel Marr, is about Truth, Valor, and Light,
not about teaching 3rd grade Sunday school at Our Lady of Pacifism.  I
imagined my main when I created him as  a Half-Elf who grew up on the
streets of Freeport and then signed on for the "war" against the "evil"
followers of Innorruk and the plague of undead that seems to infest
every corner of Norrath.  He's just not the sort to enjoy a nice sedate
high tea with the Vicar on Saturday afternoon.  Nor would he likely be
invited back, even if he had destroyed the vampire that had the crypt
beneath the abbey.  ("But, but he's so... so coarse!  Can't we just
give him a nice medal and buy him passage to Kaladim?  I've seen him
over at Groflah's...  his sort <belongs> with the Dwarves.")
