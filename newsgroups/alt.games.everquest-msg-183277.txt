This was mentioned as being fixed a couple of patches ago, I didn't actually
realise I was affected until recently. The problem is my Warrior's (Dark
Elf) face is solid black except his nose which is normal. The black is taken
from the colour of his BP (BP of Living Shadow) but I cannot seem to get it
to reset at all. Anyone else had this problem and fixed it?

Also, while playing with the armour location dyes I hit reset to clear all
the changes I was making only to find that I just took all the colour out of
my, once solid black, Breast Plate....I am not certain if I have done that
to the item or just to the item on me (will have to pop it on my SK to find
that out) but once where the Tint was Black as my Legs (Living Shadow also)
still shows it is now white...Very odd.
Oh and the BP being silver has not effected the colour of his face, that is
still black <sigh> but I guess I no longer have to suffer the pink colour of
the Helm of Raldukan :ï¿½)

Spent about 2k so far on Dye components...Still not certain I am going to
stick with current look . Seeing my first Ogre in Hot Pink was rather
disturbing, I was expecting him to start a step aerobic class any minute.
