non-melees get totally screwed by waking the sleeper (and ST *isnt*
happening without shamans, chanters, and several rotation clerics)

the zone for the most part is ruined.  no ifs no buts, ST is a ruined zone
once keraf awakens.

i too hate loot whores, just like i hate people talking a whole load of shit
about mobs and zones they have NFC about.
