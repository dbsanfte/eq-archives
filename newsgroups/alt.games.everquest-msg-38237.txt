I remember the days when OSI was almost as stubborn as Verant when it came
to listening to players suggestions to change or enhance gameplay in UO.
Once the competition came out, suddenly OSI was falling all over themselves
to make changes that players wanted put into the game for over two years.

Although I personally feel that Verrant is quite a bit more pig-headed than
OSI was on their worst day, I think you'll see Verrant start to give in
quite a bit more than they do at this time. At least I'm hoping they will.
