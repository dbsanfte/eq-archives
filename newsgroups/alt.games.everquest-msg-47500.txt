Being an alchemist myself, I will second Gregory's statement.  I always have
10 charge sow potions made up, ready to sell, I auction in every zone I am
in, I occasionally sell one or two of them.  I have defiantely made money on
alchemy, but far less than I can generate just by hunting and looting.  I
usually have a 10 charge shrink potion made up (useful for raising my
alchemy skill), so far I have sold exactly one of those.  I have made a few
potions for my guild, invis to undead, shrink, and sow.  I have made a few
for other characters of mine, Enduring breath and sow.  I believe that I am
still at a net profit for alchemy, but it's hard to say for certain as I
don't keep track.
