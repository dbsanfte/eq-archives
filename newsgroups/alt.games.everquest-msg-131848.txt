Point Blank AOE nukes do damage to all mobs
within a short distance of the caster.    This means
you are hitting 20, 30, 40 mobs at a time if
you can get them to all stand in close enough.

I use this to AOE kite with a druid friend, she
gets a dozen mobs together in a tight snared
cluster and runs right past me, I time things
carefully so my AOE goes off as they run over
me following her.  Then we fuss around a bit
while she gets them all to pay attention  to her
again and repeat.  After a couple hits like this
we swap, as by now many of the mobs don't
want to come off me no matter what... so I circle
them up and overrrun -her- position.

We can't drop high HP mobs this way, but low
blues are doable, biggest problem is that the
mobs don't treat a wimpy little druid very nicely,
she's fragile.

OK, so what if we could keep the mobs from
hitting her?  Oh, and stop that annoying habit they
have of following me instead of her?  Hey what if
we got a chanter to stun them all so they would
stay put?  Now we could both spend all our time
nuking.

Hmm, but now there's three of us killing the same
few mobs.  Here's a though, get more mobs.  After
all, they will all die with the same mana expenditure.

Hmm, but those mobs are pretty low level, cause we
can only do so much damage.  Lets get another nuker
and another.  After all we will be sitting
there till the two (three) of us med to full... might as
well be five of us medding to full instead.

Man, that druid is getting beat up pretty bad trying to
pull 30 mobs.  Maybe we should get some help.  Add
a puller here and let him get chewed up, thats a sponge's
job isn't it?

Presto, AOE group.  Now lets do the math.  Six people.
in group.  20% exp bonus for that.  They use the same
mana as they would quad kiting solo.  So thats 24 mobs
worth of killing... (assuming you had 6 quad kiters mind you)
but if they kill 20 mobs then they break even, and its
just as simple to kill 30 mobs, or 40, or 50... more than
twice as much exp per hour.  Oh, and you can do this
indoors in zones with exp bonuses. And good loot.   So
suddenly its three times as much exp and a muchness of
loot on top of that.

As a bonus (and to me a serious one) this involves classes
that can't quad.  Clerics and chanters exping up as quickly
as the hitherto favored wizard/druid classes.  If you watch
the rest of the thread you'll notice I'm trying to figure out
ways to include other classes as well without seriously
compromising the plan.
