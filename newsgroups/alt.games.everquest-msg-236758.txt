Right.

Hmm, did they tell you stories when you hailed the guys? Is that green
augment you got for LDoN mounted in a charm? Note that it's that
augment that gets the upgrades. 

One thing I'm not sure about is how the augment will work if you put
it on one of those charms you can buy in LDoN that only work in LDoN.
Maybe if you stick it in one of those, it only works in LDoN? I have
mine in my PoP charm and the aug works everywhere. 

Rgds, Frank
