SoW potions will hold you over until you get there.  And hell, on our
server, theres some people in the bazaar selling them for less than the cost
to make....  (not enough of a markup to cover the cost of failures)

If the OP is not 51 plus, then what is the value of the instaclick to him?

Vox and Naggy are both indoors, so it cannot be used in those battles, and
he wouldn't even be able to hit Gorenaire / Talendor at those levels.  Much
less something like Klandicar.

Did they suddenly add AE dispell mobs to Lower Guk (where it couldn't be
used anyways), or the OT experience grind?

SoW potions will work fine for the most part.   If restocking them is too
much of a hastle, and you have money to throw around, then just go buy T
boots.  I wouldn't wait for someone MQ'ing J-boots unless they happened to
catch me in the little window between deciding I want the purchase and
actually making it.
