If that's the case I probably have 64mb then..it's hard to remember.  I
haven't tried new drivers yet. I suppose that's something I should have
already done.  In general, though, I'm waiting until right before EQ2 to
buy a new graphics card, so I can get the best bang for the buck.

As for some of the other suggestions...noted and saved until I get home
tonight. Thanks!
