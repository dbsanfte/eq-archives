Well, the main problem is that the 'Casters loot!' call invariably comes 
when I'm in the middle of something really important, like sorting my 
spellbook by color. :)

You're right that exp/times not the be-all/end-all, but it is fun to try 
to optimize.  Unfortunately, the optimum time for casters to loot is right 
after they cast a spell and before they sit down, which is usually in 
conflict with someone else's anal-retentive notion about not looting 
before all the mobs are dead.  Well, except for the wizzies. :)

You get that impression because telling you I'd really rather sit on my 
ass would -also- require quasi-courteous bitching.  You're right about the 
no thought part, but then I get to wondering... hey... if -I'm- not doing 
the thinking, who is?  What's their motive?  It's all part of a conspiracy 
to make sure I only loot the ones that don't drop Mangy Orc Foreheads, 
isn't it?  And I wanted to make a slightly -dfferent- ittle effort.

I'd say about 20% of groups did it automatically, which is fine, If I'm 
actually collecting components for whichever character I happen to be 
playing at the moment.  And they still don't do /who 
tinker-tailor-smithy-brewer before looting.  I've found that about 98% of 
groups have no problem with trying to acommodate my junk-loot oriented 
whims, and the other 2% were part of a conspiracy to get me killed anyway. 
:) 

These days, the default behaviour in half the groups I'm in is to say "oh, 
whoops, you wanted those? I've been destroying them", and in the other 
half, I just grab the little brown baggie that appears by the looter's 
feet.  That's really the best way to loot, now that there's no spellbook, 
because I don't have to stand up and kneel and waste a med tick. :)

}Bah, Gnomes are best used for punting, dancing is a definite no-no.  :-p

I'll assume you mean pushing boats down British rivers there... :)  Yes, 
usually the counteroffer is that I may loot it if I promise -not- to 
dance. :)
