I use the maxed out weapon until the mob is mostly dead, then
wipe the floor with it for the last few blows with the weapon I
am trying to level with.

I started a few other characters, but settled into the Barbarian Warrior
early on, yet did notknow enough to raise all weapon skills sort of
evenly.

1Hs            142
2Hs            143
1Hb            12
2Hb            16
Peirce         15
H2H            like 5 or something
Archery        35

It will take me many many levels and time to get up to speed on the ones
that are low.
