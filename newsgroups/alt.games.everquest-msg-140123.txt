It occurs to me that I'll travel halfway around the world
to trade Aego or POTG/Symbol for KEI, and
that my bard would equally travel that far for Aego,
but I'm overlooking the mages.

Why KEI and Aego?  Because of all the buffs,
they seem to be the only ones that last so long
that they make a serious difference over the
run of a camp or solo.

Except for mage summoned items.  These too last
the run of a camp, in fact they last longer than
either of the other two "forever" buffs, if you
don't log out for long.

So, my ignorance of what I could be trading off
mages in my guild for is shocking.  Clearly Aego will
be a worthwhile buff for any mod 2 mage who is
grouping with a healer, so I should be able to get
junk summoned fairly easily.

Whats good?  Soloing or grouped with my druid
partner just kicking around, I cast a metric
ton of Nukes and PBAOE.  Otherwise, I buff
and heal a lot.  Don't tell me about the peridot
saver I'm convinced I'm not bothering with it
unless I"m buffing whole raids.
