I had dropped it down a bit, but, then I got a nifty new belt that raised 
it back up, and raised my hp and my ac, and provided affliction haste III 
to boot.  I only have one of my >60 DoTs anyway.  I have been working 
away at raising my HP and AC, at the expense of wisdom for a while now, 
but, just not getting many items that are better in that respect.  If I 
put my tradeskilling gear on, I max wisdom with no buffs at all, if I put 
on my regular gear, I need C3 or higher to max it out now.
