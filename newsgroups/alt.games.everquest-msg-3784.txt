Quests that require "camping", magic items that are NOT no-drop, NPCs that
appear at predictable times and places and can be killed repeatedly for
"loot" and experience, and areas of the game that can't be explored without
"raiding", are *all* parts of the game that are broken. If the game requires
actions that *can't* be role-played, that's broken.

We put up with it and do the best we can due to the limitations of the
medium, but there are some people who seek out these broken parts of the
game and play them as thouh that's what EverQuest is all about. And that, in
a nutshell, is what's wrong with EverQuest. But as I said, Verant seems to
like it that way, despite what the box and the manual for the game says, and
despite the empty words they spew on their no-criticism-allowed bulletin
board. So I wouldn't expect this to change any time soon. If anything, it
gets worse as time goes on.
