I'd have to disagree. There is very little you can do in Everquest
EXCEPT to kill repetitively. You can do it in different places around
the world and you can intersperse it with quests (that, 8 times out of
10, require you to go kill something) but in the end the way you
progress in the game is to repetitively go kill stuff until you level
up.

The game designers have admitted as much in various interviews. The
game is designed around the idea that "going adventuring" means "going
out and killing stuff".

The only thing that really keeps me going is that I occasionally enjoy
the social aspect of interacting with my guildmates and I sometimes
find a quest that involves something other than "find x and y or kill
z and bring me its head".

Basically, there's very little way to interact with the game world
short of killing everything in it, and there's no way at all for
players to initiate meaningful change with their actions. Even GM
events, while the illustrate new chapters of the storyline, are
enactments of "fixed" events. The actions of players don't change it
one way or another. There's absolutely NO way to progress in the game
except to kill, kill, kill and kill some more.

If I WANT to play a baker or tailor or smith, I have to buy supplies.
Where do I get the money? I kill stuff. Once I make something, I can
sell it for just about what it cost me to make it, meaning that I
can't make a living at it unless I'm producing some high-end product
that a player would buy. For most tradeskills, there aren't any such
products. So, how do I get by? You guessed it. I go kill stuff.

This is The Vision(tm). The new Firiona Vie server may be the only
thing that keeps me in the game, quite frankly. At least there I might
be able to have some fun role-playinng with like-minded players. In
the end, though, progressing in power there will still mean spending
hours and hours of killing stuff and getting better loot so that I can
go kill bigger stuff.

If there's more to the basic model of the game then I'd sure like to
know what it is.
