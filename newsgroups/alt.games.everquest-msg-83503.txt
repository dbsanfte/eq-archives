    Don't flatter yourself. I hoped to talk to you about this in game as

    Well, riddle me this. I say that blowing Mighty Strike is stupid,
because you're all about absorbing damage. You then bring up the hate list,
aggro management, and a host of other taunt-related issues. So, either you
were talking to someone ELSE, or you were actually trying to make the
connection "I use Mighty Strike to taunt better".

    Now it's YOU who is making the logical leap. Nowhere did *I* say that
you can hold aggro with a Wurmslayer and a rusty spoon. What I said,
repeatedly but it still hasn't sunk in yet, is YOU DON'T NEED MIGHTY STRIKE,
OR CRITS, OR CRIPS TO HOLD AGGRO. Got it? Repeat it once, should help you
learn it. Do they help? Duh, of course, more damage equals more taunt. But
if you REQUIRED them then you'd be pretty screwed as a tank considering they
happen at RANDOM, and occasionally don't happen at ALL in a fight. I logged
on the 45 WAR just to verify it again last night, seeing as how I'm just a
caster - yup, it's true.

    "At my level of the game", implying that it was somehow beneath your
limited level. Remember, son, I'm the one that's killed a named dragon in
ToV, not you. You WILL pass me one day, for sure - I don't enjoy that aspect
of the game, and you do. You also have the drive and determination to get to
that level. But you ain't there yet.

    Good lord, do you really want to compare someone who plays three GROUP
CLASSES at high level with someone soloing a druid to level 60? Does it make
you feel better about your choice of gaming experience to denegrate mine?

    That's the problem, though - guilds rarely make rational decisions. I'll
use the two big guilds on my server as an example. The one uses a dragon
kill points system - the more stuff you go raid, the more points you have to
"buy" drops. Because of that, they let the only Abashi's Rod of
Disempowerment to ever drop on the server rot - none of their monks wanted
the best 2HB in game, because the points cost would have put them below
where they could compete for something like Brother Xave's Headband. They
also have a host of druids wearing some of the highest AC Vulak drops that
are still druid-wearable, because they had a ton of points and wanted to
show everyone how 'leet they were. A RATIONAL guild might have tried to stop
this level of dysfunction, to actually improve the guild in a real way, but
they're bound by "being fair to everyone".

    Second largest guild on the server, they assign drops based on "how hard
you try". So they've been giving max haste items to Shadow Knights and
Paladins who have served in the guild longer than the warrior main tanks
they use. Rational, likely to improve the power of the guild for the next
encounter? Not really - but it's "fair".

    And that's the issue. As the most equipment-dependent class in the game,
I can see why you view raiding for drops as inherently good for a guild. And
it's true - it's the way a guild gets better, and stronger. That's not what
I object to doing. What *I* despise are the requests to leave an XP group
and travel five zones away for a res, then get told "oh, we're full. Thx for
res". The requests to help some officer's level 18 shaman get level 19 for
his new spells. The requests to help get an epic piece for someone who only
plays once per week, if that. The time spent doing things that do NOT help
the guild as a whole raid, or which are NOT justifiable for the effort
expended, at the expense of the things that DO help the guild as a whole (me
becoming more intrinsically powerful).

    You don't see these things because frankly, you have no spells or
special abilities that mimic spells. If someone asks Jakugg to come help,
they want you to join them. You're never asked to travel five zones, taunt
something off a caster, then to go away. I am a cleric with the 96% res - I
am asked to do these things. And as a self-admitted "time starved
powergamer", I can't stand it. Guess that makes me a dr00d, huh?

    Level 55 rogue, level 45 warrior. I've done more melee than you have.
(Level 40 monk, too, but he HAS been a solo effort for much of his lifespan
so I don't count him in a "group effort" discussion.)

    The original comment about "being an ant" wasn't mine, but I didn't tell
you that. It came from my buddy who first got me into EQ. He was in a real
bind - he loved items and loot, but hated the raid experience. And he was an
Oracle and a Warlord - not exactly classes that sit back and do nothing. He
actually did turn off Autoattack on one raid with Rotga, and he said it gave
him a hollow feeling knowing what he did made no tangible difference to
whether or not they won the battle (he wasn't the MA). Your choice of class,
again, and your desire to BE the MA is making you blind to all the people
who know that whether they show or not, the fight will be won. And it isn't
pleasant.

    Nor would I. I'm there to give my all, if I'm there at all.

    Which is nice, if I were talking about clerics. I'm not. Necromancers,
rangers, paladins, shadow knights, mages, enchanters, druids - these folks
have some legitimate beefs about how important they are in a raid situation
if, as I believe you believe, raiding is the point of EQ. That's a lot of
folks.

    And if that had happened, then maybe, just maybe, something would have
been done to make the raiding experience a better one for everyone. Classes
would have been balanced better, a raid channel may have been put in (being
an invitee on a guild raid is a very quiet, lonely experience). But instead,
players bend to the system and nothing gets done.

    How does that even follow? Are you as stupid as a troll in real life,
too? Good Lord, Jazz, tell me this was just the product of a no-coffee day!
Let's go each point, one by one:

-Don't like the experience of raiding: diminished role for some classes,
diminished socializing, diminished capacity to actually exercise judgement
and use the skills you spent 60 levels learning. It's fun deciding what to
do, it's not fun doing something in the only way it can be done.

-Don't like the lootcentric attitude: I don't like how rational people
become drooling idiots when lewts are involved. I don't like how people will
become total asses to get the one widget that improves their total damage
output by 4%, or their total AC by 3%. I don't like how otherwise relaxed
folks will start demanding people's time to pursue such goals with a
religious zeal, to the point of trying to exclude anyone that isn't as
committed.
    Example: up-and-coming guild on my server, maybe one step above where
you are at (does Vindi, Statue, Kunark dragons, farms ToV). Goes to Sky with
three mages to farm crowns for their epics. As the third crown drops, the
guild leader takes the crown and tells the mage that since they don't play
enough they should never get loot like that. I was in High Keep at the same
time as that guild leader when he was playing his first character - he was a
laid back Prairie boy. But since becoming a guildleader, he's changed - and
not for the better.

-Don't like the heightened competitiveness: right now you're below the radar
of Legends of Harmonium (the guild which I assume was once Harmonium, your
server's "best" guild). You kill what they don't want, because if they
wanted it it would be dead before you'd left the port circle. But you will
get better, and better, and at some point you'll want a piece of something
they still want. And then you'll find out what it's like to have to REALLY
compete, to beat people to spawns, to use every trick you have (kiting a mob
until reinforcements arrive, CoH past another raid, training "accidentally",
calling a GM and demanding a roll to see who gets the spawn, "time-locking"
a spawn to make sure the other guild never has the numbers on to take it...)
to get the mobs you want.
    On my server, that happened between Vis Maior and Wraith, at the time
the two biggest guilds on the server. It was one of the worst times to be a
high-level player, as people wanted you to take sides. People would
bad-mouth others based only on what guilds they were in. People who had
levelled up together and been friends since pre-Kunark were told to train
one another and be asses to one another based on a guildtag. Eventually, the
raiding core of Wraith all up and left - they couldn't handle the hate, and
blinked first. Today, Vis Maior and the other guilds on the server have
uneasy truces - but whenever one of the other guilds steps in Vis Maior's
way (when first Lotus Cult asked for a rotation on NToV, when The Alliance
bested Vis for ToT III), Vis strikes back (released the Sleeper and killed
the mob that would allow a tenth ring war, respectively).

    Actually, if you go around the corner from Nec Jail (where you usually
pull from, since Disco, Nec Guard and Zonein tend to keep mobs clean in the
other direction) you get Krups. If you have the levels you can single pull
the lower frogs, but generally not Krups - hence the "chumps" comment. As a
point of interest, Juggs, which are on the way to Trakanon, are close to
Reet frogs. The other frogs on the lower level are additional Krups and Ilis
frogs, and they're located just before the 'Shroom areas.

    You have missed the point. I complain about not being allowed to
determine what my mana capacity is, and how best to use it. Such as in
Velk's, where I can pull, heal, and even drop nukes and nobody worries about
dying. People learn the one tactic that works in a high-volume group, and
assume that the exact same thing will make a slower group better.

    Cleric nukes are bad for stopping runners. Very slow-casting. Running is
a function of health, mob type, and level difference between mob and things
hitting him. That's enough factors that a chain-stun or repeated roots might
be safer. There's also the fact that cleric nukes don't do enough damage to
take most frog runners down. :-(

    To each their own. I enjoy "constant stream of death" killing - the XP
is better (and getting those points makes me better, after all), there's no
painful pauses where people start going AFK and thinking about moving on,
and with my class there's still ample chances to chat. You also get to
practice the "little things" a lot more when you're killing non-stop.

    Which still have lots of time for chat, BTW, and where you're even MORE
likely to know exactly what is up where and when. Most slow, single pull
groups are searching for spawns.

    More correctly, that they are allowed to be inefficient when I am told
to be maximally efficient, whether the situation warrants it or not.

    ON ONE MOB PER /DISC REFRESH. ONE. Do you think that somehow that one
mob, just like all the others, is somehow going to get away from the MA when
all the OTHER mobs you pull when the /disc is down don't? Building
additional aggro is a red herring, Jazz. I've tried to explain that over and
over. Saying you use Mighty Strike in an XP grind for aggro is like saying
in an XP grind you use Defensive to stay low on the hate list so the MA can
hold aggro.

> (even if you don't *really* need it)

    Then what's the point?

> does extra damage

    If you're in a small group, the damage can be significant. If you
aren't, it's a drop in the bucket of what Orlun is churning out. The cleric
nuking likely puts out the same amount of damage over time. :-/

> maximizes efficiency of mana use,

    And that is important, why? Slow group, lots of extra mana. We are in
the "slow group" scenario, right?

> let's the tank "have some fun"
> and leaves more mana for the cleric to "have some fun".

    This is about the only part of your point that makes sense - cleric, by
being maximally efficient, has more mana to play around with. Very solid
observation. Now if only the tanks in the slow group would ALLOW the cleric
to play around. Which was, as you remember, part of my original rant.

> Not letting the tank go low and "show off"? Pisses off tank and makes
> you feel better about being poorly treated.

    Warrior (since this is only an issue with a warrior) gets over it.
Really. Not being berserk gets a warrior so bent out of shape that they hold
eternal grudges? Hardly. Most warriors really do like the idea of a cleric
that wants them healthy, you know.

> And if there *IS* a sudden
> extra add you didn't anticipate *JUST* as the cleric's about to cast
> CHeal on the low tank?

    Irrelevant. As I pointed out, the low tank dies on the pull, NOT when in
camp and about to be CHealed. If the warrior is out of range for CHeal, what
do I do? Chain-cast Remedy, bend over, take off my greaves, and get ready
for all but one mob that the puller has incoming? Let him die in a situation
where he might have lived had I healed earlier?

> Second scenario... the fast xp group.

    So we want everyone maximally efficient. We also recognize that the
warrior in question is NOT a disproportionate part of the group's damage
output. Gotcha.

> Letting the tank go low and "show off".

    Note: we let the tank go lower to be efficient (although I still like
using CE on a departing puller, to keep them in safety range - it's a
judgement call there as to how high "safe" is). We give them the
tongue-lashing of a lifetime and make sure they don't get a chance again if
they use that opportunity to use Mighty Strike.

> Does what? Maximises aggro (which is now *more* important)

    Maximizing aggro on one mob per what, 60 to 54 minutes depending on
level? Compare that with Charge, which you got at level 53. It lasts LONGER
(14 seconds versus ten), it recycles FASTER (every 30 to 24 minutes), and it
makes SURE that at the beginning of the fight you WILL get aggro (Mighty
Strike still depends on you landing blows). And it increases your damage
output. Good lord, Jazz, it sounds like a BETTER /disc to use for what you
want to accomplish! But damnit, it doesn't create a string of pretty
numbers, does it?

> At this point nobody is having fun. You're griding.

    I'm sorry if you don't enjoy getting XP, if you feel it's a burden
placed in your way to stop you from rushing to the REALLY good stuff. I
enjoy it, I have fun with it. Different strokes.

> Not letting the tank go low? You're blowing CHeal mana when your MA

    The only warriors who don't go low are the ones who have shown, either
by words ("Lemme go berserk! Lemme go BERSERK!!!!") or deeds (popping the
disc before) that they aren't as committed as I am to seeing things go
smoothly, in the high-pull-high-speed environment. If you want to slow
things down, fine - let's slow them down.

    That'll change. As you level up you'll find places where the most
important factor is the level of the puller. You'll also, if you're lucky,
find out the magic that an ENCH puller can accomplish.

    I know you wanted to hold aggro, so I'm not sure this would have
accomplished what you wanted, but did you think about using Evasive after
you had aggro? Against a red, you might find you're hitting about the same
number of times (not much at all), and really only generating "swing" aggro
anyways. Or did you use Charge to get that initial burst of aggro, to make
the transition? I honestly cannot recall what you did other than bravely
step up to the plate and take one for the team.

    Ah, ok. So, and this isn't sarcastic (unlike half of what I say): why
didn't you choose Charge? It does last longer, and against a red con I'd
think it would end up generating more aggro than Mighty Strike.

    If you can improve the situation BETTER another way, why wouldn't you?
Claiming "I deal x% more damage with Mighty Strike over Charge" doesn't help
if that damage is insignificant, does it? You're thrashing (which is also
the mental image I get when I see someone blow Mighty Strike :-) )

    Actually, I think we showed that Mighty Strike is pretty much a waste
all around. :-)

    If that's what you read, no wonder you're so off base. Again: I don't
let retards who demand efficiency of me get to show off. In a low-pull
environment, this is easy to accomplish, and usually happens anyways. In a
high-pull environment, this requires a concious decision on my part to stop
them. Sorry if I didn't differentiate enough for you, although I DID show
you exactly what environment I was initially thinking of (Velk's) when I
said it.

    The group plays on Thursdays and Sundays. They're at level 25 or so now,

    After those first few hours (I met a friend coming down from Luclin at
