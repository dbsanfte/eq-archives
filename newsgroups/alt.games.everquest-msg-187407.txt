From the shadows, the mysterious "phil-on-a-hill" <nope@nope.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Some of the are for quests. Some of them are for taking up an
inventory slot to annoy you. You can look up the quest for each item
at allakhazams if you want, but perhaps you don't like spoiling
things. If that's the case, you'll just have to talk to some NPCs and
see what they ask for. Start with your trainer (the guy you took your
note to).

>Is there an easy way to find where a bind point is?

Select yourself (F1) and type /charinfo, that gives the zone. If you
want to find out more precisely than that, you'll have to actually go
there, by tlocating, gating, or dying.


>Are there some sort of in-game maps (because I keep getting lost)?

Yes, eqatlas.com (I think that's the URL)... but being lost is more
fun.

(I've been there a couple times long years in the past to see what
they list for ZONE EXPERIENCE MODIFIERS, but just try convincing a
certain one of the dense smegheads HERE that...)


>When I talk to an NPC, do I really have to type out lots of things by hand,

For most NPCs the keywords you need to include are [in square
brackets]. Incorporate those keywords into a sentence and you'll
probably get the next response. Sometimes it seems to demand
punctuation.


>Is there some sort of way to have the game 'remember' my current quests, or
>do I really have to use pencil and paper (despite the fact I have an 80gig
>HD).

There's a note thingy that comes with LoY expansion, but you're stuck
the old fashioned way without it (or minimize EQ and make a text
document at least).

>
>Is there a way to heal my man above 50% (apart from gaining many levels)?

From the 50% I take it you're binding wounds? The answer is a
qualified "no". You can't go over 50%. Not until you are *way* higher
in level. 

Of course having another person around to heal you helps. Cleric,
druid, shaman, paladin, beastlord, and ranger all have healing spells
(some better than others). Bards can heal as well. And there's a gimp
healing type spell from necros, though that's not something you'd want
to rely on. 


>When a monster is getting the upper hand, there seems to be no way to outrun

You can try strafe running. People do this different ways, but for me,
it involves clicking and holding right mouse button (to mouselook
basically), and then holding down the forward AND either left or right
direction keys.

You get a VERY slight edge in speed on the monster this way, enough to
take you out of hitting range temprarily.

Alternatively if you don't have far to go, you can try jumping, which
gives a slight kick of speed. But you run out of that yellow stamina
bar very fast.

Or you could get a druid or shaman to cast spirit of wolf on you. Ask
politely, they get a lot of requests and are a bit cranky over it
after the ten thousanth or so.


>It seems to take an age to memorise and scribe a scroll - is there a way to
>hurry it up?

Once you get meditate it gets a bit better, but it will always be very
slow.
