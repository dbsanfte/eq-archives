Normally, I'm a skulker that reads without ever replying, but I feel I
should defend Alabama from this one short minded man that lives within 50
miles of me. Alabama has the geatest diversaty of any place that I have
heard of. We have more millionaires per square mile than any place in the
world.... not saying we have  more millionaires, just more per square area.
But, we also have the homeless beggers that wander our cities streets. We
have small communties of very uneducated people that do not like outsiders.
In contrast, we also have the Minonites that are centuries behind in
technology that welcome good paying tourists to buy their goods.   We also
have Mobile and the Mardi Gras, Huntsville with the Space Center, Birmingham
with it's schools of fine arts. We have temples or churches for every known
religeons, many in Huntsville alone. We have miles of wildlife preservations
for hiking and camping or hunting with the correct liscences. I will admit
that we are far from the best place to receive an education, but we excell
at the school of hard knocks. I can't think of many places where you can
find every tribe of man living and working as neighbors, although not always
peacefully. For the nature lovers, we have the foot hills of Appalachia in
North Alabama, our own Grand Canyon near middle Alabama in th Little River
Canyon, swamps in South Alabama, plains across the Blackbelt of our state.
Every year during the Fall, I take my family driving through the hills to
admire the colorful leaves. We have something somewhere for every intersest
you can have. Personally, if you don't like where you are..... move
somewhere else. As a Pagan for the past 17 years, I can relate to the
prejudices you will find here, but you must find what similarities you have
with your neighbors and try to overlook minor differences like the name of
your God/dess if you both worship the Bearers of Light.

More on topic though, I don't like any creature that doesn't blink. Rude
scaled things just stare at you and stick their tounge out as they slither
by without even a curteous greeting.
