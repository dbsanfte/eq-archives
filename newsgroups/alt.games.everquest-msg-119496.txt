I'd be surprised if there were any more server splits. The meteoric
rise in new players has slowed considerably (the game is what, three
years old now?), and the expansions mean that there are even more
places for players to spread out.

The splits were done to address over-crowding issues. I play on Prexus
which is often one of the busier servers, and even there I don't see
any crowding problems.
