The theory of evolution doesn't require triggers; evolution is always in 
motion as genes randomly mutate. Sometimes they confer an advantage and 
that gene line will gradually come to dominance, sometimes they confer 
no immediate advantage or even confer a disadvantage, and then when a 
plague hits that gene is pivotal to survival.

But the gene wasn't a triggered random response to the plague. The gene 
was simply a random mutation, that fortuitously took place prior to the 
plague.

Its =possible- that the advent of a plague might act as a trigger to 
generate far more mutations than normal in the hope of generating a 
defensive gene if one didn't already exist... but that isn't currently 
part of the theory.

Quite possibly. This is where the fish example comes in. Increased 
mutation rates ('triggered' by the onset of cold) would help overcome 
the overwhelming odds against generating antifreeze in time.

(This hypothesis should be fairly testable though, and I'm not sure if 
any progress has been made on it.)
