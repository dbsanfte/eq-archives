    I so agree KEI needs to me nerfed. It has completely screwed the low
level game. I really feel sorry for enchanters, since now they are not as
needed in groups.

    A friend started a Enchanter and stopped he just could not find a group.
I am a Cleric and I refuse to go running for KEI.  If you know what you are
doing you do not need KEI. I firmly believe that KEI has just resulted in
more crappy players getting to higher levels.
