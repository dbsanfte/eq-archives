My problem was better.  I got the response that the User Name and Password
were not correct.  I just about had a heart attack.  I went through checking
keyboard/language settings (I have Russian and German keyboards available),
caps lock.  Nothing worked.  Called VI cust service and got the recording
run around.  Then went to online cust support and waited...  Finally I
logged out and back in, worked like a charm.  Scared the Bejeezus out of me.
