May be a bit early to ask this but what the hell.

What if any alternate training (new post 50 stuff) has anyone done
(or plan to)?

I put a large portion of my XP into this for now to stay at level 52
for a bit longer (want to get that white dragon scale in the old
world if I can ever win the roll).  But for my Bard I really have no
idea what I want to go after for sure (maybe raise my Dex or Cha so
I can re-arrange some equipment).

Anyway what have the regulars (or non-regs) thought about doing and
for what class?
