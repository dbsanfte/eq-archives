All my pets are named Spike (much to the confusion of some
of my group mates)

The air pet stun is an awesome taunt.  It's one of the best
taunters you have.  Also, some mobs are more pre-disposed
to pull off your pet on you.  Any humanoid mobs *seem* to
be more willing to come after you than animals will.

Go find "an" orc warrior (not "a" orc warrior - big difference
in levels.) you should see a substantial difference in
behavior.
