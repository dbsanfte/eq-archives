"**So one of you,** facing a million hit point boss mob (fairly common in
today's game) can expect a full manaburn to land for 10s of thousands of
points of damage in one hit."

(emphasis mine.)

If it was based on total health, not current, as many wizards as were there
could do a full manaburn.

The only way that just one wizard would be able to "full" manaburn, and all
the rest could not, is if it decreased the amount of damage due to the mob
being injured after the first landed.
