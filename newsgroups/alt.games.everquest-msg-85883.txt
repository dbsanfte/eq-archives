not just cleric out of mana, but fighting "uber mobs" you can sometimes
expect to see Rune V used (not chain casted or the chanter gets killed) as
an extra means of keeping the MA up until he receives his next cheal..  the
MA dieing is a common cause of raid wipeouts

btw bedlam is another version of this spell (ive seen beserker str mentioned
a few times) but is componentless
