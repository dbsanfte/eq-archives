 STR is one of those things that doesn't give that large of an increase
on damage as some people would like. Basically you wasted your time
(imo) in trying to get 255 STR. Work on HP and STA. As you level up and
attend more raids later on you'll find that most gear you get will add
STR without making you focus on that particular stat.
