Read through the other posts and didn't see it mentioned just yet. This is
completely situational. If the competition between groups or the spawn
itself is such that everyone can heal and med up between pulls, you should
fight.

For instance, if you are camped and killing a mob that spawns<or you only
get your turn> every 20 minutes, then the mob drops fastest and everyone
remains at the highest health/mana if you join in the fight. The mob dies
twice as fast, does 1/2 the damage.

If people are chain pulling, the puller will go by everyone else's health
bars. That is, when they see the cleric type only has 1/2 of the group up to
full health, they will stop pulling. In that case, you should be medding
24/7 to keep everyone in the fight.
