I really dont see it as much of a perk.  You get to divert 20% of your
experience to work to get things that really seem more like they should be
standard parts of the UI rather than skills.  You get to put a magic icon
over the named mobs head because some of your party doesnt hear you scream
"Kill the named!  Kill the named!" because you arent really yelling it you
are typing it?
