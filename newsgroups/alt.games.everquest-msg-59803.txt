Thanks for all your replies.

I've actually fixed it now.  First I rolled back the driver to that which
comes with XP, no change.  I then used Windows Update to update the MS Live
driver to the latest version, again no change.  I then found the following
link to a driver update for XP on the creative FTP site.  This appears to
not only fix the problem but also gives me Audio HQ back which I find useful
for adjusting sound settings.

I still occasionally get stuttering music in some zones but I can live with
that much more than I can live with that horrendous shrieking!!!

The drivers I used can be found...

here

They are about 8.7Mb though so people with slow connections may be there a
while.

Thanks,

Simon
