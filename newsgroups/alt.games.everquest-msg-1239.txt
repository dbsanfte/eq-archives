LOL.  Actually I DO have an iksar monk, but he's like level 2.  I just
play him when I'm camped in a planes raid.

My observation on this comes from watching a guildmate in the Best of
the Best monk competition last week.  The iksars tore up the humans.

Now if this were magicians or shamans or clerics or something, no big
deal.  PvP has very little to say about their abilities in game.

But for monks, it does.  Damage output and damage absorption are the
monk's stock in trade.  I'm am afraid that iksar monks, er, "own"
humans.  And this doesn't even count the full value of regen, the
better swimming, better night vision, etc.

If your primary character is a monk and he's fairly low level (and I've
erased it but I think you said you are 15), I would consider twinking
and restarting an iksar.  On the other hand, human monks are perfectly
viable and welcome in groups.  But monks tend to be very proud of their
uberness in melee.  I'd personally make the change at 15.
