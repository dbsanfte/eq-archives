No offense taken. I summarised because replying to everything was just
taking absurdly long and I kept saying the same things in different ways.

True. :-)

Pullers pulling on partial HP is a pet hate of most clerics, I suspect. :-)

I wasn't sure where your experience lay, which is why I went into CHeal
strategy. I did my 30s and 40s in pickup groups, no particularly outrageous
buffs (nor on the tanks - I didn't see Aego block a buff until my early
50s), and avoiding KEI myself - I saw too many people becoming dependent
on it.

Clerics don't like it because the melee move out of healing range, and
moving to stay in range cuts down on medding time. Melees don't like it
(I'm guessing) due to difficulties in getting positioning right.

But snare + fleeing MOB = MOB stands still and lets everybody beat it
down, from what I know of snare... I wasn't thinking of simple "fear"
fleeing, but of that final stage with a snare where the MOB just stands
there and gets beaten down.

Having unique group abilities per class is an idea I find very appealing,
but would probably be very firmly in Sony's "too hard" basket.

Thanks, and noted.

I don't think they need to be either, but they need to be viable at either
soloing or grouping, and currently at levels 61+ neither is true.

Simultaneous /lfgs from tanks are pretty rare from what I've seen. The
groups
I've been in would just snap up the first to announce it.

May not be with some tuning; apparently SOE think the same thing - there was
mention of tuning Warrior Taunt abilities at the most recent Fan Faire,
apparently.

I was thinking in terms of adding a +aggro to Taunt - add some amount
of aggro (a function of the Taunt skill and level) then check the skill
and do the max+1 hate list stuff that currently happens. You could give
the same thing to paladins and SKs (perhaps at a reduced level).

So we seem to be thinking along similar lines, although I wasn't thinking
in terms of a burst of damage - the main function of a warrior is to
take damage, not to make it.

Agree, it was getting out of control. :-)
