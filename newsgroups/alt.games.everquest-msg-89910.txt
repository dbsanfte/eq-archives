Like enchanters or wizards?  In levels 1-20 fights while the brainless tank
whacks away at a critter the enchanter may stand up, cast a spell, then
immediately sit back down, all outside of the meleer's view.  The critter
gets down to 90% health, the wizard stands up, nukes, then sits back down.

It never ceases to amaze me how many newbie tanks feel like if you're not
meleeing, you're not contributing.
