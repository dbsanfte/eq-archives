Wow!  Bizbee's *STILL* smarting from the time, last *JULY*,
I documented his flaming-of-the-undeserved after he asked me to.
Gosh, the last time I gave him a hard time for flaming anyone
(other than me) was, let's see..  Last July.

I must have spanked him even harder than I thought, he's
been issuing petty little snipes like this ever since.

Either that, or Bizbee's the sort of person who is unable
to let go of criticism the better part of a year later, and
nurses childish grudges damned near forever.

Either way, it's mind-boggling.  Forty years from now
I fully expect him to be wobbling around in his wheelchair,
waving his cane at the orderlies in the nursing home,
cackling, "better be nice, or Dan Day's gonna getcha!"

I wish I could say it's nice to loom so large in someone's
daily thoughts, but it's just so pathetic that I can't
take much satisfaction from being the object of an
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

But it's funny as hell to watch him fixate.  He clearly
can't get enough of me.  Sorry, Bizbee, no matter
how hard you struggle for my attention, it just isn't
going to work out -- I do *not* date the mentally ill.
