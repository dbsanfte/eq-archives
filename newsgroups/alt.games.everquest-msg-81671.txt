(chuckles) I will, tonight, when I get back from my 12th viewing of LoTR.
The biggest problem I've had with it, other than the auto-stack thing and
not being able to read the text sometimes, is that I have to actually
*squint* at the damn thing. I'd really rather, I think, that they made it
some color against some other colored background. My eyes are bad enough
without having to work at this stuff ;)
