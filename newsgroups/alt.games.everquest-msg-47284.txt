Almost everything starts with flu symptoms. If you are asking am I hopping
over cracks to avoid breaking my mother's back, the answer is no. It's not
about being scared, it's about having some logical precautions in place, and
being prepared as best you can.

Agreed, but what you can prepare for not only improves your odds, but also
gives a small peace of mind.

This is leaping to conclusions, you do not know me, have obviously misread
my comments, and you certainly have no clue how I am with my children, odds
are they will be saving your ass, or someone like you one day. What is
normal and well adjusted? A "protected" childhood where when things like
this occur the first instict is to cry, then look for the quickest form of
suicide or one that as well adjusted, understanding the law of survival is
always in play, regardless of who pay the price?

We are not the army and we are not ont he frotn where ground zero is

it's more likely you will not be exposed at all, and more likely to be
barely exposed than at ground zero. Therefore it makes sense to prevent
breathing a diluted substance.

See above.

Quote where I said that. I think you are either reading what I wrote wrong,
or simply don't have it correct at all. I don't ever recall saying I left
anywere. I do recall saying me and my family live in a metropolitan area and
are staying...
