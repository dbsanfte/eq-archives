I also feel that this person is at the very least dealing in nefarious 
goods. As such, I have no reason to assume that he is honest and ethical 
in other areas of his entrepreneurship. 

I do take offense to your claim that I am blindly following someone 
else's views. Why do you have trouble accepting the fact that several 
people can come to the same or similar conclusions for similar or even 
very different reasons?

Your own assumptions are a heck of a lot less supported than ours.
