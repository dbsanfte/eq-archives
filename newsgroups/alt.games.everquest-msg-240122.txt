Raid exp skews the results.. which I don't really wanna make a big deal of
because it will be nerfed.

In simple group terms (ie no raid to alter the exp, bonuses and such), it
takes 20% of your regular exp, and converts it into leader exp.  By the time
you have dinged 4-5 aa's, you will get a leadership point.  Test it and see
=)

Btw, erollisi must be a horribly over populated server, to camp fennin for
11 hours?!?! Man fuck that, kill stuff thats up or run the risk of ending up
with nada !
