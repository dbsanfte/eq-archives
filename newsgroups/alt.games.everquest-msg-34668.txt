Actually, you are on the right track. Going into Blackburrow will allow you
to get
better money. Most of the mobs carry arrows and bows. That is a cheap way to
replenish your arrow supply. And the rusty weapons will sell for a good sum
too.
But the best money I have found is in the Qeynos Hills area, just before you
zone
to Qeynos. Willowisps. The tricky part is, you need a magic weapon! DOH! So
the first order of business would be to save up for some sort of magic
weapon or
to find someone that can summon magic weapons. Maybe make a deal that you
will give him a percentage of the lightstones you get or will hunt for
components
(ie batwings and bone chips). Also, hunting diseased animals is a good (if
some
what dangerous) source of income and experience. And firebeetle eyes work
well too. It may SEEM like you are not getting much money, but my lower
level
characters started around Butcherblock and the money didn't start to flow in
for
them until 9th - 10th level. As for your lousy bow, take up fletching!!!!
Rangers
can use some of the best bows in town, and the components are relatively in-
expensive.
