It could easily have been a neck item.

I'm perfectly aware that I couldn't wear it.

However, my rant was concering my notion that although Monks, Warriors,
and Rogues are technically capable of wearing it, only Paladins, Rangers,
Shadowknights and possibly Bards should have even considered doing
so, unless none of the above were available.

AC 7 is just not fabulous even if its a neck item.  13 wis or int, on the
other hand, is a darn good item in -any- position, especially if you
aren't having to throw away AC to get it.

A couple other mithril items dropped, all "tank" only, by the way, it
was only this one that caught my outraged eye, the others either
had more defendable stats for the class that won it, or went to
a hybrid, don't remember which.
