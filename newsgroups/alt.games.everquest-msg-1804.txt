But the same can be said for Dark Elf Warriors and I could post a screen
shot (to the binaries NG before you scream) of a 60th DE warrior with the
Warrior epic, seems when the going got tough he coped admirably.

Some races are better served at classes than others but this by no means
makes the others useless in that role, don't be put off if you want an Iksar
warrior (being unable to wear plate is a disadvantage for a tank, imo) for
example or a Human SK.
