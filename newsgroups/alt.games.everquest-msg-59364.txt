I agree with shadowspawn here ! When you - in DAoC - die to another player
you dont lose items nor exp !! You release your body and spawns at your
bindpoint (you can bind yourself in the cities) with all your items on you.
No corpserun !

Theres a lot more, but i dont have the time to write them down... going to
launch my camelot.exe...
