Kurn's is so-so xp up to 20 (IMO). I've squeaked out 20 on a few toons
there in the dining room waiting for the undead cook to pop so I can
give the glowing skull and get the skull of torture. And maybe the
shield. As for OT, again, IMO fight along the shores by the PoK book
easing east as mobs permit til around lvl 23 or 24 then go south of
the outpost and along the zone wall til 25 or so and work you way to
the ramp. 

This is how I did it solo in OT.
