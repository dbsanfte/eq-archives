Weapon does twice its listed damage and delay is ignored. 2 handed rusty
swords are good until your pet starts hitting for over 20.

Probably just what you need for your epic. Most factions are already trashed
by being a necro.

Thats cos the mob then attacks your pet. spam "/pet back off" and it will do
things. The pet engages again because the mob hits it again. Tanking for
your pet wont work either, since pet attacks when you get hit (an option I
would like to see disabled).
