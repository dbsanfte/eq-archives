Last Saturday my son decided to fly my character over to Commons with
450pp to buy a second icepaw war claw for his ranger. After an hour or
so with no success and watching the manic auctions fly by, he decided
to see if he could pick up any bargains, and he made an offer of 200pp
for a Short Sword of Ykesha which was being auctioned for 1kpp, the
guy accepted immediately.
So he now has 250pp left to spend and he then dives feet first into
the market and within a couple of hours went from buying a Gleaming
Short Sword for 250pp and then swapped that for a Springwood Club for
a Wurmslayer for a big piercing weapon (forget the name) for a Glowing
Black Sword for a Ornate Rune Blade. So within a few hours he acquired
a Ornate Rune Blade , EQprices price 18,300pp. possible Ayonae Ro
price 2,000pp

During the time in the tunnel we noticed that all the mid range stuff
(levels 25 -45) which cost between 2,000pp and 20,000pp was going for
between 10 to 20 percent of the Eqprices quoted. Anyone fancy a
Crystalline Short Sword for 1000pp, that was the price of one being
sold in the Tunnel on Saturday. This was just one of MANY items being
sold at ridiculous prices. It's too late now but maybe every tradable
item in EQ should have been given a Merchant price, I dunno ,<shrug>

Do other servers have the same problem. It seems that on this server
Eqprices, Allys and Casters prices are all completely useless
