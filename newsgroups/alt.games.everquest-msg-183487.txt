    DT is definitely male, if that helps.

    I'm over it don't worry. I'm a little TOO over it. And I don't like
seeing people mindlessly flaming  (flaying) someone for being wrong, for
having a different opinion, or typing in caps to simulate shouting. Flaming
people for flaming is probably even more inane, but nobody ever said I had
to make sense.
