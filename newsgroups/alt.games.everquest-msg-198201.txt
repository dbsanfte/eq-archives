Keep in mind that all the ranking shows is relative position.  All
that your observation requires is that other servers (Tunare for
instance) gain more population than Karana does during US prime-time.
If you watch the old euro-located servers (Xxx Bayle) you can see it
very easily, during euro-prime time at least one of them moves down
near the bottom of the list, and during euro off-times I've seen both
higher on the list than the PvP servers.
