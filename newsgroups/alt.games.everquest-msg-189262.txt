Okay then, while we're at it, I want plate armor for my enchanter and for 
him to be able to cast while running.

I think you're vastly overestimating the usefulness of AE mez/stun here.  
It's a huge risk vs. reward.  With an AE mez, you get enough time to land 
your full mez on quite a few mobs.  But if you're within the casting 
area, there's a good chance you'll be mez'd along with them.  AE stun 
lasts, what, 8 seconds?  And it overwrites mez?  And let's not even talk 
about the aggro generation from this.  Suddenly you've climbed to the top 
of the aggro list on all but maybe 1 or 2 mobs in your camp.  How long do 
you think you're going to last?

Yes, you can lock down lots of mobs fairly easily.  But with the aggro 
you're producing, good luck if you get more than 1 resist.

An enchanter's power with respect to crowd control is easily offset by 
their frailty.  This certainly isn't what makes them overpowered.
