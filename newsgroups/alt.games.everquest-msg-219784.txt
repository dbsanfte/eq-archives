I have to disagree here - if you have a mezzer, it's faster to have
everybody on one
MOB at the same time than to offtank.

You have a certain amount of DPS that can be applied. The two MOBs total
some number
of hit points. If you switch instantly from one to the other, offtanking
will take
exactly the same amount of time for the two MOBs to die, because you are
applying
the same DPS "pool" to the same MOB hitpoint "pool".

But it doesn't work that way. DPS from the rear of the MOB is higher, and
damage to
melee in the rear arc of the MOB is lower because they are not subject to
riposte.
So DPS is higher if everyone but the main tank is behind the MOB. Basically
you're
losing maybe 20% of the melee output of the offtanking warrior.

The other factor, as Jennaii mentioned, is healer mana. The first MOB stays
up longer
and does more damage over the course of its melee. The second MOB stays up
longer as
well and its DPS is applied over the whole of its life in camp rather than
just half
of it. Net result is that you're increasing the damage taken by the party by
at
least 50%. You're also reducing the options that the cleric has in healing -
they
have aggro for two tanks to worry about rather than one, so they may be
forced to use
a heal-over-time rather than a possibly more efficient heal. Nukers have
similar
aggro issues.

Then of course the cleric has to heal the poor chanter who is having their
mez
broken regularly.

The net result is that the healer(s) will chew through mana much more
quickly.
If they have enough mana to spare that this is not a problem - then that's
mana
they could have used for nuking, reducing party DPS. Otherwise they have to
take
a med break. What's the DPS of a party during a med break?

The only *gain* in DPS is that the mezzer can spend their twist (for a bard)
or
mana (for a chanter) on DPS instead, but the relative gain is small. You're
gaining
a fairly small edge in DPS in exchange for a huge increase in the use of
something that often drives the pace of a party (i.e. healer mana).

Is there some logic I'm unaware of that makes offtanking better?

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
