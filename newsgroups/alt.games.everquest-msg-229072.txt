I get this all the time, but only when switching machines. I have characterA
on machineA and decide to log characterA into machineB, I camp, start the
login process, kill eq on A and finish on B - bad state. Just camping and
coming back all is good. When I look at the eq directory there are lots of
characterA_.ini files where there should be a server name after that
underscore. To fix it I just copied my character files to a copy that did
not have the server name. This worked for me for the times I really needed
to get going quickly................
