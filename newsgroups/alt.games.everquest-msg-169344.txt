Was He?  Did He desire larger governments?  Would He have supported a
program where the weathy support those who refuse to work?  Sure, Christ
emphasised charity, but that's alot different than liberalism... for one,
charity is _voluntary_.  If the government takes the money from you, it is
not charity.  Where does Christ take on the role of a modern leftist?

Letting the market forces work themselves out =/= greed.  Allowing people to
succeed or fail according to their own efforts =/= greed.
