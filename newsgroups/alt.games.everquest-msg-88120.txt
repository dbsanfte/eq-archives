This only works up until a certain level. At 51+ or so, you definitely
need at least a druid healing along with shaman slows. Shamans don't
scale up as healers after a certain point.

We've done the Observer camp in Chardok with a 57 shaman, a 57 druid,
and no cleric. More than one person called us liars when they asked if
they could drag corpses to our camp for a rez and we informed them
that we had no cleric.
