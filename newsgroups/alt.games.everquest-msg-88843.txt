So when your in a dungeon...?   Believe me dieing where you stand is
sometimes the very best thing.

If i LD and am going to die, I'd at least like to die in the spot I went LD,
so I know where I need to C.R from

FD fails, FD is seen through, mobs who cast an AE will break FD EVERY single
time.

auto suicide?  You become an npc, which includes the ability to cast your
spells (such as heal).  I've died on LD when pulling a few mobs, I've also
gone LD and come back with the mob dead and me alive.. get over it, it
happens

So how about you just go get a group?  Then when you go LD its not insta
death, nope, you'd rather whine here :)

If you solo, your more prone to dieing on a LD... if you group, you have a
form of cover, its your choice to solo or group

I've died 3 times in 1 day, all within 20 mins because of LD, and I still
disagree with you
