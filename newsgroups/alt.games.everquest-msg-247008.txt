Headlines!
Gates of Discord content retuned!


Gates of Discord
------------------- 
- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed
and beyond.
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more
appropriately for their intended level ranges.
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in
particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had
difficulty with.
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to
complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all
events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all
players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the
zone.
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by
changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on
several NPCs.
- Spell drops have been increased.
- Increased the rate of cash drops.
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate.
Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this.
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards!

Collision
------------------- 
More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more
difficult to get stuck.

Misc.
------------------- 
The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.
