Very important.  While you may be able to defend yourself against players
who con white (even) to you, when you're attacked by someone above your
level (or want revenge against such a person), or when (as happens a lot) a
group of players are camping, say, a PoK book, you need some people who will
more or less reliably come to your aid in clearing out the PKs.  By the way,
if you're playing on Sullon Zek and are evil or newt then it's unnecessary
to be in a guild.  You'll do just fine.  Matter of fact, send me a tell
sometime ingame (my char name is Mekail) and I'll give you a personal
demonstration of how well you will be able to defend yourself.  Free of
charge, I consider it a public service.
