I'm a 12th level Monk on Kunark...I was hunting in The Field of Bone.  I had
a Scalebone Skeleton on me and a Scaled Wolf Hunter.  Neither of these
creatures are much of a challenge for me, yet people think they're helping
out by taking one of them from me.  I didn't ask for any help, so usually
that means I don't want any help.
Another problem I find with these "lame players" is that they don't realize
that some of us are actually role-playing a character.  My Monk hates magic,
and gets angry when it's used on her.  Too many people think that I (the
player) am attacking them verbally, when it's just my character.  If I'm not
talking in character, I use /ooc
Oy, some people's children
