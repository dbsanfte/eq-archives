Came across this one just now.  I remember how many peeps were moaning
and bitching when tailoring was stealth nerfed so advance warning
helps a lot this time around:

Dev Ngreth has issued a notice for alchemists out there:

Attention Alchemists!

We've made some dramatic changes to the Alchemy Tradeskill which
include both the recipes as well as the products. We've taken some
time to evaluate the Alchemy skill as a whole and make some very
substantial changes in per-combine pricing, sellback pricing, skill-up
paths, and product desirability -- All of which will prove to be
beneficial for patrons of the skill.

Now, without getting too deep into the changes made, and without
spoiling some of the things you'll see in the expansion� We would like
to take a moment here to briefly mention the more intrusive changes in
the hopes that you will be able to more adequately prepare yourselves
for them.

First, we have modified nearly every alchemical recipe that currently
exists in game, and when these changes get pushed out to the Live
servers, many of the old recipes will no longer work. This means you
may find a number of the ingredients you have been carefully
stockpiling for months are no longer valid. This also means that it is
recommended that you use them up before the next update (which is
currently scheduled for the 21st.)

Second, we have modified nearly every vendor purchased alchemical herb
that currently exists in game, as well as adding a host of new herbs
that we use in the new recipes. There are no cases where we increased
the value of an herb, so stockpiling vendor purchased herbs now in the
hopes of gaining money is a bit of a futile attempt. We do not
recommend it.

Finally, we do not ordinarily announce changes of this nature,
however� Given the amount of time and money that some alchemists have
spent gathering materials, we would hate to see them suddenly become
useless overnight. Please make sure that you use your time and items
wisely and as soon as you can.
