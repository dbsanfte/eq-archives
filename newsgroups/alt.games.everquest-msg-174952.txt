Hey all,

Apologies for newbie posting, I promise I am capable(ish) of research
really... It's just I haven't been able to find answers to these
questions yet...

Can anyone tell me why there are so few references to the Venril
Sathir Server (the new UK Server) e.g. it's not on any equipment sales
server lists on Allazhazam, Mysupersales or Castersrealm.
    Is it just because it is soo new and will soon be included, or is
everquest dying a slow death because of the understandable excitement
surrounding SWG or something else and I will never see the kind of
player support on the web that the US Servers see?

Does anyone that listens to this board play VS or are you all on US
boards?

What is the ratio like for people playing on PVP/ Roleplaying/ Vanilla
girlie servers?

Is there somewhere where I can see the ratio of classes/races
currently on a server, so I can pick an underused class/race next
time?

At what level would getting to the bazaar(heard it was good for
getting money/equipment)  or paludal(heard it was great xp for teen
levels) be possible/easy/a good idea for me? I am 11 ranger atm,
newbieing in Blackburrow. If the answer is now or soon, how do I get
there? I have looked on eqatlas and understand how to get there when
I'm in Luclin, but how do I get to Luclin?

I know I am asking loads, and apologise if this is the wrong forum. If
this is the case, perhaps you could direct me to a better means of
getting the information I so crave to make what is currently a great
game into an even better on for me.

If I can help anyone that can help me in anyway (obviously not in EQ
but perhaps IRL, windows/web developer by trade) then I would be more
than happy to. Oh, and I have never in my life cross posted or replied
to a troll, so I can't be all that bad.
