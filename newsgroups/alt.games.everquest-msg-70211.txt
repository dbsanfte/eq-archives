Well I tried going from HQ textures to Medium and it seemed to help a
little bit. (already had social animations turned off) It's still a
little choppy at 1024x768 in some zones in Luclin but fine in the old
world.  I might still buy the Gainward Geforce 2 ti450 to tide me over
'til Feb/Mar when I upgrade everything else.  

768meg? Sheesh. I just bought another stick of 256 to get to 512 last
week. :)
