One of the many facets of EQ is the thriving player economy.  We loot
things that none of the classes in the group can use, we loot things
that replace items we already have, we loot things that aren't as good
as items we already have...and we loot lots and lots of platinum, or
smaller coin that can be converted to platinum.

Since the majority of items are not coded "no drop" we can sell them
either
to vendors or to other players.  At the same time, we often find
ourselves
unable to loot items that would improve our characters... but we can buy
them
from others.

Out of this, an economy is born.  Unfortunately, finding a buyer for
your goods, or a seller with items you want, takes time.  Generally all
those sales take place in zones where we can't get any experience or
hope to increase our combat skills or acquire new weath of any
significance.  So this sort of trade takes away from the play most of us
enjoy.

On my old server, I found someone who actually enjoyed buying and
selling as much
as he enjoyed playing, and I set him up as my broker; gave him my
sellable stuff, and a list of items I'd like to get, paid him a
commission on all sales, and never had to sit around auctioning again!

Unfortunately, trustworthy people of this inclination are hard to come
buy.
