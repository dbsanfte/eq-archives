Did you see me claim it was bug free?  Did you see me say I expected it to
be bug free?
Did you even see me say I wanted it to be bug free? (Well, I do want it to
be- don't you ?  Or do you want bugs?)

If you take two seconds to think (maybe a bit much to ask of you), you'd see

"working" if it still contains substantial bugs.  The idea that you can say
that about a product with substantial bugs is precisely what is wrong with
the software industry.
