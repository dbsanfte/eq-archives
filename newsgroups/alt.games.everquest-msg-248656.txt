A friend, a dark elf SK, has a similar problem. From the Great Divide
PoK book ledge, he just floats fairly quickly down as the rest of us
ran towards the Shad Wurm caves. He didn't even get out of that
Eastern valley, that's how fast he floated down. He was still
levitated but only a few feet above the ground. I am pretty certain he
wasn't doing something like looking down towards the ground.

We are still mystified as to why that is happening.
