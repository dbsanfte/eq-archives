real quick cause I'm tired and going to bed...

processor/memory will be fine.  sound will be passable.  Video will probably
be worse than horrid.  stock video cards in compaq machines are for word
processing and web browsing.  not for playing games.  you shoul dbe able to
get away with the classic EQ/Kunark and perhaps velious, but no way will the
new models, etc run acceptably.   find out exactly what video card you have
in there.  if it's not at least a GeForce 3, upgrade it and you should be
fine for the new models/textures.  do NOT get a GeForce MX however.
