	There's always wyverns.  Should be able to do sirens and bulthars
too.  Entrance to Karnor's.   Mons Letalis zone in to the Grey, golems and'
snake men.  Spiders and statues in velketor's, never too early to start saving
crystalline threads...  Nurga would work.  With KEI you could probably quad
toilers over at the boathouse in ME.  I think some of the stuff over in EW 
might still be blue.

	GREAT xp?  Well no...  But some (toilers and wyverns) adds up fast
enough and have decent drops...  Nurga goblins are rich.
