Oh, believe me, as a liberal, I'm much more inclined to give Tony Blair 
the benefit of the doubt than yourself would be under normal 
circumstances (and I would probably still vote Labour, even after this 
fiasco, if I were allowed to vote here). Still, I've lived under his 
tenure as Prime Minister long enough, and I've seen him renege on his 
promises enough times to draw the conclusion that whatever it is that's 
holding his back straight these days, it's not precisely a backbone...
