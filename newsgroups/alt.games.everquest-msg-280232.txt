As a former EQ player it seems like there are a lot of "reasonable"
positions here.  People have a right to be pissed off when a vendor
tells them "sorry, I screwed up and need to backcharge you for the
last couple of months'.  Sony probably isn't eager to let a million
bucks (give or take) slip away just because they made a billing error.
And you're right, if you like EQ, what's the big deal?

All that having been said, at a time when EQ is probably still
bleeding players Sony needs to weigh that million or so bucks
carefully against the number of people who either get pissed off or
who get an email and say "gee, I'm still paying for that, I thought I
cancelled EQ 6 months ago".  It wouldn't take a lot of people
cancelling to make this a foolish move on Sony's part.
