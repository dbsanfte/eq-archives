"Moral" is subjective too. So much for that. The concepts of 'good'
and 'evil' may be steady for any given individual, but they vary from
one person to the next, and one culture to the next. That is what is
meant by subjective.

No, they are evil by *your* definition. By their definition, the
person who slams a plane into a building, killing hundreds, is
guaranteed passage to heaven. And you, as an American (I'm assuming),
are evil to them.

By that definition sunshine is evil because it wakes me in the morning
before I'm fully rested. Not being rich is evil because it means I
can't afford the new monitor I want - having it would make me happy. 

>Which I think most beings would agree with.

Any definition of evil can be shot down, precisely because the term is
subjective.

Unless, of course, one or the other of them *wanted* the action
performed on them. Beating someone with a stick might be considered
evil by most recipients of such a beating. But a masochist would want
it, and enjoy it, and would not consider it evil.

Subjective, you see.
