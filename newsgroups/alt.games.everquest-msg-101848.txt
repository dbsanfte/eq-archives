Hmmm.  Well, my friend and I were trying this last night, pulling the
bandit Slansin up by Toresian, but unfortunately we got our signals
crossed and we both camped to clear aggro :)  When we got back, the
bandit had poofed.  Then there was no one behind the counter
downstairs.

Today I checked and there was no one downstairs, then went and talked
to Toresian ("hait," "I study enchantment," etc.) and the real
(non-bandit) Slansin spawned downstairs.  Handed in the potion, tried
again, and got the real one again.

Any tips on getting the bandit back?
