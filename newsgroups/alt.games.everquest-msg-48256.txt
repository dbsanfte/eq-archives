Hi!  If you have played Ultima Online in the past and have since deactivated
your account (doesn't matter when), I would be interested in buying it.
Basically I would be buying the code number on the back of your original
disk.

Let me know if you are interested in selling through e-mail
(tbirmingham@twmi.rr.com) or ICQ (113316110).

Thanks!
Todd
