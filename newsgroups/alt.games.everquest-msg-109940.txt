Well, as one person mentioned...  eq.castersrealm.com has a creation guide
for Shamans.

For KOS purposes, you may want to go with either Vah-Shir if you have
Luclin or Barbarian if not.

If you don't care about KOS issues, Iksar and Troll are fine,  so is
Ogre...  Although Iksar might have better wis stats versus troll and ogre.

Vah-Shirs have an advantage over Barbarians, which is safe-fall  and night
vision.  Barbarians have Slam and the ability to wear medium OR large
armor.

Iksars and Trolls have a small regen value.  While someone said that is
good due to cannibalize, it isn't much of an asset unless they use Regen
along with the natural regen.

Now, the main issue for all but Iksar, is size.  Until you get your shrink
spell or potion...  Your size is going to greatly be a hinderance for you
in some towns and dungeons.  Places like Firiona Vie and Kelethin, your
size will prevent you from entering certain buildings, even while ducking.
I even remember one jerk who decided it would be a good idea to block the
bank door in Kelethin because he was a barbarian and no one in zone could
shrink him, or would give him wolf form so he could go into the bank.

Anyways, those are your options.  If you don't want to deal with KOS
issues, Barbarian or Vah-Shir.  I have seen Shaman of all types, definitely
practice on piercing, since it looks like your epic weapon is a piercer.
And as a side note...  Make friends with a druid or partner up with one....
Especially when the druid hits the 49th level for Skin of Nature and then
56 for Natureskin.  Why?  Their Regen with the Skin regen helps out a lot
more than just regen when cannibalizing.  Even though Skin of Nature's
Regen is small, stack that with normal regen and  any natural regen, and
your cannibalizing won't be as painful in regaining mana.
