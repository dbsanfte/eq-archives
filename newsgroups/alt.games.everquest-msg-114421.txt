I can only speak for the old world, up to Velious. But as far as
dungeons go, they're all BYOG, Bring Your Own Group. But some dungeons
I've enjoyed hunting in since my bard dinged 30...

Dalnir - Squashed things in Dalnir with my guild a month or so back.
Fun zone, but not so fun CR if you go deep in. We stayed on the first
floor, outside the temple structure. Lots of casters, so resists songs
are played mostly.

Sol A - Went here while questing for Lambent components. Spent lvls
33-35 in this zone camping outside the King's room. For some reason,
the ice baced damage song does little more damage than normal.
However, in Permafrost, the fire based damage song hit for up to 30pts
of damage. Hmmm.... /bug maybe?

Permafrost - Didn't spend too much time here. Only went here for Icy
Greaves. Green wizzy goblins who see through invis are a pain when
going deeper in. Goblin elites are good exp,however.

Crystal Caverns - I started out hunting hill giants in Rathe Mtns.
When the group there broke up, me and the group's druid ported to
Great Divide to bind in Thurgadin, then hunt in CC. We had no problem
filling out the rest of the group when we zoned in with a cleric, 2
sk's, and a wizard. We camped the spider queen's room for a bit, then
moved onto Genoids. Good, solid, fun experience. Bardic crowd control
shines in the queen room. I was able to wander in the middle of melee,
twisting AE mez, healing and haste with lute in hand. The queen and
her followers fell easily.

All I can say is I've also taken a fancy to grouping in dungeons since
I hit 30 and started on my Lambent quests. I have my sights set on
Lower Guk and Sol B next.
