Okay, so I'm a level 59 mage, and I've never thought of this... Although,
there have been very few times I would have needed it, but still... I got my
pegasus cloak by luck, a friend needed some help in Lake Rathe, and while
running through SK I saw Quillmane, stumbling around all alone. Only the 2nd
time I had ever seen him, and got my cloak. And I did a dance.
