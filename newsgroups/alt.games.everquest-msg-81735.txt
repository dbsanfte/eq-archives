You don't need the pic, you get exactly the same
functionality with the new interface by hitting "i"
(to bring up the transparent inventory screen) and
then dropping your stuff into the box marked
"AUTO EQUIP AREA" in the new inventory screen.

It's to the left of your coins, above the "Done"
button, and below your shoulder/chest armor slots.

It operates exactly like your old "face" box used to.
Drop stuff into it and it automatically puts it into
your inventory (or equips it for you if it's an
armor piece and the corresponding armor slot is
unoccupied).
