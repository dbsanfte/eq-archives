The game has been designed to be an immersive RPG.  If you don't like
the concept, there is always console gaming for the short attention
span.

It's what it is, and frankly I prefer the deeper RPG experience that
it provides.  I agree with the previous poster in that while
meditating you should not be able to take in what is going on around
you. In that respect, you should consider the ability to even carry on
conversations while meditating a compromise on the designers' part.
