Heh -- that's your problem: 96Mb of RAM.  WinXP really needs
256 just to not be a sluggish pig.  Then, throw-in another
100Mb for EQ, and you can see your problem.  With just 96Mb
of RAM, just running XP will cause some swapping.

Try bumping the laptop up to 512Mb and you'll probably do
OK.  A 600MHz P3 is not too shabby for a laptop, so I'd
place 99.9% of the blame on the shortage of RAM.

As a reference, I play a second char on a Celeron 466 with
512Mb of RAM (no Luclin, though) and it's quite playable.
Not as smooth as my new 1.4GHz machine with 1Gb of DDR, but
it's still usable :^)
