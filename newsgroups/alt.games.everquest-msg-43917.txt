Scenario:

ScammerX somehow gets ahold of account information on a fair number of Visa
cards, including billing information and email addresses (really not that hard
to get, and no, I am not telling anyone how, the last thing the net needs is
more hackers with half a clue). He then weeds out all of the accounts to which
no billings for EQ access exists.

To each, he sends an emails, notifying them about a billing mistake. it's easy
enough to fool most people from thinking that an email is from one address when
it is actually from another.

Subsequently, extra billing appears on all of these accounts, with the recipient
of the funds being a company so closely spelled to the billing account name that
the legitimate charges go to, that few people notice, and those that do are
likely to disregard it.

Because they all received prior notice that this would happen, few people even
think to question it, and before the fraud is discovered, ScammerX has long
since disappeared with who knows how much money from innocent bloodthirsty
mob-slayers.

Yes, this sounds very conspiracy, even to the degree of paranoia; but
considering some of the scams that have been perpetrated through the internet,
it is entirely believable - and worth checking into, especially since I have yet
to see on either verant.com or everquest.com anything related to this issue,
which has apparently affected several people. I am not saying anything untoward
has happene, just that something might have.
