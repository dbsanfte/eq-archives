And yet, if the term originated as developer jargon (which is, as
far as I know, true), then a permarooted mob is still a mob.  From
the PoV of the developer (or, equivalently in this case, the game
engine), a permarooted mob is a mobile object with zero assigned
to its mobility attribute, rather than an object which has no
mobility attribute defined for it at all (like furniture in EQ).
To put it yet another way:  it's the difference between impossible
and inconceiveable.  The flaw in the argument you guys are having
is that you're trying to make sense of a piece of jargon without
the context that provides much of its meaning.  You simply aren't
"speaking" the same dialect as those who invented the term and
gave it meaning.
