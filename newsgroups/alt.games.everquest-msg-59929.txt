    No, you aren't. You're doing 1.5 times as much damage as before
(assuming all damage is melee-based, which it likely is), so it takes 1/1.5
= 2/3rds the time to kill stuff as before. So 1/3rd less damage, or the same
as a 33% slowdown with no haste.

    I prefer running it correctly.

    I've met players like this, unpleasant people who'd cheerfully tell
people to bugger off in the name of "XP efficiency". Same people whose
guilds are hurting for level 60 clerics and wizards, but who won't let those
classes join XP grind groups so their third alt can gain XP 8% faster. Since
my two post-50 characters are a cleric and a rogue, I usually find I can
leave these people screwed by leaving their group after they alienate
everyone LFG in the zone. And it makes me feel good, to be honest, to give
them a taste of the LFG hell some classes go through.

    That's good. When I'm in Velk's, I see members of the "big two" guilds
cheerfully whacking away, in no risk of dying whatsoever. I ALSO see a lot
of people who have no Velious armour other than Ry'Gorr who play tanks.
These people simply don't have the gear to tank mez without a slower or an
efficient healer behind them. And considering slowers are snapped up by the
dog groups and the upper spiders camp, that leaves the efficient healers -
the clerics.

    You've read about Jakugg here, right? Level 51 warrior, all crafted,
Kunzar Ku'juch and something similar as weapons? He is the average tank I
see on the floor in Velk's. When his group gets adds, and has no SHM to slow
everything, what the hell should they do OTHER than try and park/mez? He
ain't tank mezzing squat - it will *eat him alive*, doubling at near 100 per
until his 2800 HPs are gone.

    I will say this may be server-specific. My server is Quellious. Just
last week a second guild on our server managed to clear NToV, and in
retribution for stealing "their" uberrobe off Vulak (who has died maybe four
times total on the server) the best guild died a few times before finally
releasing the Sleeper last night. Those two guilds are the only Kael guilds
on the server - everyone else is Skyshrine. Only two other guilds have
killed Velketor besides the top two. The average equipment level is well
below what I see when I log on my first character on Zebuxuruk for a visit.
And the people who WERE well-equipped, well, a lot of them have been lost
recently - the first guild that was killing nameds in NToV disbanded when
over half its members quit EQ at once. We've even had one person who had
Palladius's Axe of Slaughter (one of the few Vulak loots on the server,
remember) die tragically in a car accident. So you just don't see the sorts
of characters that can do the things you take for granted.

>Why would I suddenly run a risk of dying now?

    More importantly, why would you be in a zone as crowded as Velk's when
you have an entire guild to call on to form a group anywhere you want, like
geonids in Wakening (which I've heard are blue to 60, but have not confirmed
personally)? As an aside, seriously - you could be ANYWHERE you wanted to
go, and you end up in Velk's? Not any of the other zones you cheerfully
brought up when asked if there was any upper-end XP grind zones in game, but
overcrowded Velk's? Hmmm.

>Let me guess, you think a 3 spider pull is a situation that "needs"
>crowd control right?


    If you don't want to be sitting around for the next X minutes waiting
for the healers that went OOM spending twice the mana healing as if you'd
single pulled all three, or six times the mana compared to if you'd pulled
one, then yes, you need a total damage mitigation system. Inefficiency, I
can handle. Inactivity bugs me, though.
