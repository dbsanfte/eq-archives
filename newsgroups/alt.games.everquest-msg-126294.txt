True, but for pretty much all classes, the "experience" changes. Especially
if you can suspend your disbelief. For example. A level 2 warrior is killing
Fire beetles. A level 50-somethign warrior can easily take down Giants and
goes up against dragons and Minions of Innoruuk, (Forgive my ignorance of
the high game, never played past 30... yet). Also, at level one he can swing
a sword and kick. At level 50 he can perry, riposte, double attack, weild
two swords, etc. Now, if you can get in character, high game is much more
fun.

Same thing, to an even greater extent, with casters. A level 1 Necro has a
crappy skeleton and a lifetap spell. A level 50 Necro has a Specter pet, can
solo almost anything, and is just bad ass. So, if you're into the atmosphere
of the game, it can be very different.
