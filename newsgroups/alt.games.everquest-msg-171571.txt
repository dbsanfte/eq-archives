Any caster who wants to spend a little time in:  FoB, EC, Steamfont,
NRo, Everfrost, any other zone with spiderlings in reasonable supply
can have a KEI by level 6.  And doubtless can be level 12 by the
time it wears off and he has to buy his next one, which is easier to
get since he can kill the 'lings and gather their silk that much faster.
At 50pp per KEI (many get away with paying less) that's 1000 KEI's for
the cash that would get a melee a fungi tunic, which would have less
impact on the melee's progress than the KEI does on the caster (fungi
doesn't kill mobs, just lets you recover faster, KEI is both ends of
that equation for casters).  If that's levelling the playing field
then you are using that phrase in a new and "special" way that I
have not encountered before.
