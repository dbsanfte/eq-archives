Well - here's my relevant experience:
2 boxing mage/cleric

Pull mob and send pet in.
CH pet with cleric (at what % depends on mob)
Immediately sit cleric down, having healed 4k+
No aggro - ever.

Mage gets tagged
Cleric tosses supernal remedy his way - sits *SMACK*
he gets hit.

I'd say you got aggro as a combination of slow (high aggro),
and dots (high aggro).
