Overthere.  I don't know if the ogres on the island in TD are KoS to my
Gnome Necro or not.  I hop off the boat and use gather shadows.  When I
would go to The Outpost from there, I would jump off the boat again and cast
gather shadows.  There are some Undead guys hanging around the dock you may
need to watch out for, though.

What level is your Necro?  There's a good island where you can kill fallen
Iksars at 6000, -1500.  The level ranges on the sites are discrepant, but I
think I killed there from 15-17, maybe.  Some people claim to still get EXP
at lvl 20 and 21.  *shrug* I didn't see one other person on the island in
that whole time.
