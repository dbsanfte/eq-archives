Nearly everything you say is true, and nothing but the truth.

1) Wizards are a complete waste of time in EQ, i always tell newbies to
delete their freshly made wizzie and make a druid or magician instead. I
stopped playing my wizzie at 17th level, then i stopped playing EQ for about
10 months. Completly frustrated over that the class absolutly sucks. I mean
Verant should remove the class if they don't even take it seriously.

2) Druids seem like the only class not nerfed. They can do *everything* all
the other classes can do, maybe not totally 100% as good, but wow, good enuf
so that they become the top number #1 class played on EQ, and also the most
solo effificient class in EQ. I would suggest to Verant to remove the druid
class from play, as they interpretation of that class is totally wrong (they
are newbies no doubt).

3) Every warrior dual wields, and it's so boring to see everyone doing it.
Give us some 2hand weapons that utter destruction when even only saying its
name, or even better, show us some real shields, so we also see paladins
with great tower shields!

So then we have removed the Wizard (due to total waste of a character slot),
and the druid (because he can do everything the Wiziard should of done plus
more).
But do you think Verant will listen? Noo.. and do we care ? Noo.. because
NWN is soon here and then we can dictate how to play fantasy role playing!
(Here the wizards DONT suck... trust me.. heheh).
