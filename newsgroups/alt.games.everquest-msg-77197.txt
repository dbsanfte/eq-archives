I was in a rollover 18 wheeler accident last June and my Kunark expansion
got smashed (as did my $2000 laptop). When I got my new desktop computer, I
lost Kunark. Now I have the SoL expansion but nothing else. Would it be
worth my while to buy Kunark again? I've got an 18 druid and several other
characters that are up and coming, from 13 on up. I've heard a lot about
hunting places like LOIO and at present, I couldn't go if I had to.

TIA


Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
