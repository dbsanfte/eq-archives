Heh, reminds me of when my guild leader was helping me camp my Cracked
Darkwood Shield (I dinged 19 and 20 waiting for it, and that dang Mucktail
never did show).  About halfway though she tells me she needs to do a port.
I fight for a while, not doing too badly, as I was in wolf form at the time,
and a few minutes later, she comes back and drops some Darkmail Gaunts on
me, that the guy had given her for the port.  Damnit, why can't pally's
port!

Hmm, so let's look at Verant's non-combat money makers.

1.  Porting - available for two classes only
2. Rezzing - availabe for two classes, but only one is likely to make any
money off it, since a Pally rez just doesn't keep up with a lower level
cleric's...
3.  Alchemy - available for one class only
4. Jewelcrafting - available for all, but viable only for enchanters

So, basically, the only "tradeskills" that make money are the ones that are
restricted to certain classes.  /rude verant.
