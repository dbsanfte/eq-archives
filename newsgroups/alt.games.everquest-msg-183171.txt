You left out something. Efficient healing requires aggro management. SKs
are much better at holding aggro than warriors, which in an exp group
compensates for their relatively low HP. (And in a raid they can do decently

If a warrior has 4000HP and loses aggro once per MOB, and an SK has 3500HP
and does not lose aggro, the SK may require 20% more healing, but that's
more than compensated by the lack of a requirement to toss in a patch heal
that uses maybe 40% of the mana of a CHeal. (My standard patch heal,
Remedy, heals around 470 HP for I think 175 mana, vs. 400 mana for CHeal.)

Less mana used on healing = less downtime, usually. I've seen rangers tank
and require less downtime than the "proper" tank classes, simply because
they did a better job holding aggro.
