I quit a year ago, and i wish i could find out if my char is still on my
nevynus account / bristlebane server b4 finally, one day, managing to find
sum way of paying with a UK debit card and wasting 15 quid only to find out
the account is empty.

I know they say 3 months only, but, so does DAoC and my char there was saved
for 6 months, who knows.

Steve aka Nevyn Woodwhisper
