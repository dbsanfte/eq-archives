%t will result in whatever you have targetted.
If your macro is "/gsay %t is truly a wonderful person"
and you target me and run it, your group will see "Darkensolo is truly
a wonderful person"

Works for ANYTHING you can target.
 
To add multiple things to a social button, just make your own.

Type:  "/hotkey ButtonName first command" and hit enter.  You'll have
a new button on your cursor.  Put in the shortcut spot where you want
it, then right-click it to edit and add the rest of your commands.
