That significantly increases the cost to make items.  I can make 4 
pristine oils/washes/resins/solvents per combine at a very minimal cost.  
Aside from that, those are just the first step combines, in order to make 
one essence, I need to first make a Trinoid reagent, then make a Dye, 
then make Ink, then I can finally make the essence.  It is similar for a 
scribe making spells, they use the same inks.  Unless the Ink were 
available as pristine, you have to make it, as that is the primary 
ingredient.  Dye is the primary ingredient for the Ink, and as I recall, 
the Trinoid reagent is the primary ingredient for the Dye, leaving me 
with the option of buying the Stroma ingredients only, and those are 
trivial to make, and one combine of each will allow me to make 2 to 4 
inks.  In addition, I don't need to make them high quality, as they are 
not the primary ingredient anywhere in the process.
