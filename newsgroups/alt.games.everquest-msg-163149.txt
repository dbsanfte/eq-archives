Umbra is on by default, as the others said. Umbra is great, since the
bugs were supposed to be worked out. If you are on a 300mhz the
advantage of it will be as marked as it was for me on my 400mhz.

What umbra does is only render what you "see." This makes it
a VERY good combination for higher FPS along with the clip plane. An
excellent place to check this is in Shadow Haven (while freeport is
very bad since the clip plane seems to do next to nothing) Go in
shadow haven and get to a place where you can see fairly far in any
direction, with a small enclosed room nearby. Push the clip plane all
the way out. You should now lag a lot. Now, with it still pushed out
go into that small enclosed room. Your graphics lag should be gone.
That is what umbra does.

The other posters say that disabling umbra in the eqclient.ini no
longer works, but when it did you could REALLY see its advantage. I
did the above with it disabled and you still lagged just as much
graphically in the small room without umbra on. See, even though all
you see is four walls without umbra you are STILL rendering the stuff
outside as far as the clip plane goes. This was very dramatic when
turning in the small room with clipping all the way out both with and
without umbra. I also used FRAPS to measure it numerically, though the
difference was obvious on my tnt 16 meg 400 mhz with 512 meg ram. 

So anytime that you are in a zone which uses umbra well, such as shar
vahl or shadow haven, and  you are in a more narrow hall or inbetween
buildings or in a room then at that point you are really getting more
FPS due to umbra.

As I said above, outdoors and in other areas where you still render
things far away no matter what your clip plane is, you won't notice
the advantage as much. Newer zones like Luclin indoor ones really make
use of it. A very nice feature of it is that its done in software so
any old video card gets an advantage from it.
