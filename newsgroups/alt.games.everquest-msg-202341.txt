Believe it or not, there are three different gnoll factions...Darkpaw
Gnolls who are enemies of the Jaggedpine Forest folks, Blackburrow Gnolls,
and the friendly white guys...I think their faction name has Brell in it
somewhere. I know my half-elf who is Max KOS to both Darkpaw and
Blackburrow gnolls can stroll around with the white guys, and use their
vendors.
