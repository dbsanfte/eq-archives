 Kaesora is not buggy unless you use pets. If you don't use pets you
should do just fine there. If you go there with a group 45+ most things
will be green if I remember right. We went there (library) around 35-36
and didn't have a problem camping there for a few hours. If you move
past the spiders than the only mob that casts spells are the skeletal
warders. They are cleric mobs and like to heal a lot. Maybe one of the
named are casters but overall you will be facing straight melee mobs if
you're not fighting spiders.


 The 50+ people there are either farming something or trying to get the
fang for the Charasis key. The zone really isn't that difficult. Just
make sure you have some sort of snare available.
