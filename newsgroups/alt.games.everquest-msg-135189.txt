eDKP, or Emperor DKP hehe.

We felt it was only fair that the people who'd put the most time (and
exp) into getting this guy down finally, should get the first rifts. 

Originally we were going to hold the staff until we'd got another, then
hand all the rifts out on our first VT raid day. Then a few hours before
we killed him they changed the rules, so we had to some up with
something quick. Someone totted up how many Emp/Blood/PH attempts
everyone had been on, and we used that list.

After the second kill (ie: 80 rifts) we'll probably just be on to
'whoever needs' and most of them will rot anyway.
