Hehe -- just last night a guildmate and I ran into a guy
with a HUGE, hard to pronounce (much less remember) name.
My first comment was, "I'll bet *he* doesn't get many tells".

Then we decided that if we ever started an enchanter or
other "gets begged for buffs too often" character, we'd
name it "Ijjilijllijiiijl".  That's bad enough in the
newsgroup font, but try typing it in the game in the
message chat window, it runs together so tightly that
it looks like a UPC bar code.  You'd need a magnifying
glass to type it properly.
