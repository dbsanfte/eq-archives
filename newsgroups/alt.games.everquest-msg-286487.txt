This sounded like quite an exploit at first until I remembered
that you can only unshroud at the shroud merchants.  So I can't
bind at the shroud merchant and then, when I die on a raid,
take a shroud, get rezzed, and unshroud back at the raid site.

As a melee, shaving those rez effects could be huge.  Unlike mana
or hp, there's currently no way to restore endurance quickly.  So
when I get rezzed in a raid, even if others are also being rezzed
and re-buffed, I often find that the raid is ready to roll and I'm
just barely done with rez effects and finally starting to get OOC
endurance regen.  Since I'm often the puller, this means I have to
either hold up the raid while I regen, or I have to risk the first
few pulls without enough endurance to power my various save-my-ass
discs.

Hm, I wonder if I could set up a fellowship campfire at the raid
site?  Then when I die, release to PoK, take a shroud, get rezzed,
use the shroud ability to return to PoK and remove the shroud, and
then use the campfire to port back to the raid?  If I zone fast
enough that might be more efficient than just waiting out the rez
effects, though it's 4 extra zonings (compared to getting rezzed
before the return-to-bind timer runs out) which is a bunch, and it
also means it takes longer before I can start to get buffed again.

Bah! How dare they rig the game to actually enforce the penalties
for dying! :-)
