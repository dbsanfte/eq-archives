|- rangers can tank

	As a Ranger, I have tanked every mob on the first floor of Sebilis except
the Emperor and Blood of Chottal, serving as MT for my groups.  On some days,
I am puller, MT, snarer AND slower.  (Did this most recently in D1, with NO
Bard or Enchanter in the group, and pulled half of D2 too.)

	Likewise for Chardok and Charisis.  I've also served as MT in spider camps
in Velk's, but those mobs are somewhat gimpy.  On Luclin, include the Grey (my
usual solo choice) and Maiden's.  (And Fungus, but again those mobs are
gimped.)

	Between the new armors available and the long-overdue Defense increase,
"Rangers can't tank" is true for raid-level mobs only.
