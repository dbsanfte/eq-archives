OK, explain how you cast a spell on a mob that moves faster than you which
makes it run away, then meleed it to death with its back turned, or even
stayed in casting range of it while it kept running and kept nuking it.

You might have done something similar to fear kiting, using fear to make the
mob run, nuke and/or DOT it, then wait for fear to wear off so it returns to
start again... but for this Flash of Light would have been cheaper and
better.

You might have done it with SOW or something to make you run faster, but
keeping a mob thats running full speed in melee range is pretty hard to do.

You may have found some targets that run at snared speeds; I know I used to
happily fear kite Spectres and Cobalt Drakes and... mmm, seems to me at very
low levels some kind of beetle?  Been a long time.

You may have used an exploit where pathing kept a feared mob from running
properly.

But really fear kite a normal mob without snare or SOW?  Have to explain
that one to me sometime.

Shaman do the same thing, as can druids who root rot.. the question isnt
really how many mobs die at one time, -or- whether you have any down time
between mobs,  but how many die per hour, and thats based on mana efficiency
and mana regen combined.  If a druid kills 4 mobs in 5 minutes, then rests
for 5 minutes before doing it again, and a necro kills one mob every two and
half minutes with no down time, their kills per hour are the same.  Shaman,
who can Canni -and- benefit from KEI, can see a lot more mana per hour than
even a necro... but arguably have less efficient ways of killing mobs.  With
the death of KEI for low levels, necros might be winning this battle under
45 again, certainly they are likely to if you exclude "with a KEI buff" from
the "soloing" description.  But if you want to use the "mobs dead per hour"
baseline, it's not druids or shaman that make a mockery of necro thruput,
it's bards.  Mana?  Yeah, eventually this can be a concern, but nothing a
Solstice Earring can't fix.  A bard's problem is flexibility- they can't
kill a lot of mobs because they can't find running room to do it in!

I did think of something necromancers arguably kill best; casting mobs.
Fear kiting means not having to worry about what that mob can and can't do.
Bards do pretty well on them too, though, charm the caster and let him use
up his mana on his friends instead of on you.  Sadly, bards get to a level
where charm is no longer a useful tool in this way, as the caster is too
high level for the best charm the bard will ever get.
