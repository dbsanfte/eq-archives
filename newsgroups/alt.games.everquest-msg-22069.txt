Hi,

It's that way for me too!  I never have the CD in the drive but the
intro movie always starts anyway.  My original installation is from
before Kunark came out (but I have both expansions) maybe that has
something to do with it?

Perhaps the newer EverQuest CDs don't place the movie on your hard
drive (or for that matter even include it anymore).

There is a file within my EQ directory named eqintro.smk, perhaps
this is the intro file.  It is around 88.7 MB or so.

I think the .smk extension goes with the smacker player, a program
used for some intro's in other games as well. 

There was such an intro file for the game Creatures.

You could try moving this file (or renaming it) if it is present.

I would not just delete it.  At least not until I was certain.

I have not tried doing this.

Best Regards,
