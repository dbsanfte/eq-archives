Hi there, I was in a similar position back in Oct (couldn't get EQ anywhere)
I ended up getting it from Ebay (make sure it's a sealed copy) I got mine
for �7.50 then I got my mate hooked on it, he got his from Ebay too (but
payed �18 lol). I notice there are a couple of auction going on now one @
�21 and another @ �25.

If you can wait a couple of weeks PCZone magazine are including a full copy
of the original version FREE on their next cover CD :)) along with a 2 week
free trial (rather than the normal 4 weeks), I'm getting a couple of copies
of the mag coz the kids wanna start playing ;-)

Hope this helps you out
