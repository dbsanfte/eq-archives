Firstly the guild isnt even 3 months old, so you are just posting shit
there.
Secondly, it wast the item, but the policy that got up my nose. (see the
difference?)
Maybe you think its ok to donate 2 weeks of your like to sucking up to a non
uber guild and not getting anything for it? Youd have to be pretty desparate
to get into that guild imo.
Ive already got an invite into an equivelant raiding guild, and once im done
xp'ing ill take them up on it, and there wont be any "no loot for you" shit.
