I hope you didn't take my post as a slam. It was meant only to direct you 
to the bard community at large. Another excellent site is The Concert Hall 
( http://pub142.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.quickJumpTo?id=theconcerthall ). You 
will find that there are a lot of people there that know what they are 
talking about, as well as the fact that there are a lot of bards that must 
be statisticians because they spend an inordinate amount of time testing 
things to make sure that we all have accurate information.
