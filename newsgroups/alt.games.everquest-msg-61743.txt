I feel your pain :/ 

Last winter, I bought EQ+Kunark, bought a voodoo 5 for roughly 200
dollars (this is not America), had to return voodoo 5 since my machine
didn't have the appropriate slot, got a voodoo 3 2000 that would fit
and got 128 mb RAM for the rest of the exchange amount. Took cover off
my machine, juryrigged a CD burner, made backup of my computer,
installed voodoo 3, looked at where the RAM chip was supposed to go
and put RAM chip on my shelf instead. 
Put cover back on computer without attaching properly, reformatted in
FAT 32 so I'd see all my HD space since the machine was erroneously
delivered as FAT 16 and with 2 partitions whereof one was larger than
FAT 16 would support and hence had decided it didn't exist at all the
previous spring, installed windows and other stuff, installed EQ,
waited till I got Velious (around easter) before putting in the extra
RAM, since 64 mb wouldn't really cut it anymore then.

I'd rather buy a new computer than do another hardware upgrade on this
thing.
