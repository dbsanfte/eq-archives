Aye, I have a SB Live Value with Win2000 and EAX does not work with EQ.
Sound is okay but music breaks up every once in a while.  It used to be a
lot worse with sound going away completly or even screeching occuring at
times.  But now it's behaving with the exception of the music which breaks
up sometimes.
