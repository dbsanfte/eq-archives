I suspect that you're just not very familiar with the best hunting areas.  
I think it's pretty much the consensus that Kunark newbie zones are the 
best in the game.  In fact, one of the nice things about playing and Iksar 
is that you can level pretty much all the way to 60 without ever leaving 
Kunark.
