Yep, whats even more funny though is the /tells of "can i loot that SG
please"  or "can i loot that spec please"

My fave though has to be "/y /y /y  help please!!!  But don't ks it! Heal me
instead!" as though it is our duty to power level them.

Im lucky in that I haven't been to Oasis in something like 4 months+ (a
passing visit, on way to TD for a fayducky killing)  its amazing what 3 or 4
high levels sat at the dock waiting for the boat does to the nearby
population heh...
