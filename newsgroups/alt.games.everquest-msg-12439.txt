Only lures, fire spells, and unresistable spells have any possibility of
landing on them.

Icewell sentries are a deliberately extreme example because of their magic
resistance. Mature wurms in skyfire hit about the same, and have about the
same hp...no warrior is going to solo one of those.

They are 100% immune to all offensive spells of shamans (excepting the 5
point burst of flames...that one lands just fine). Even after putting
insidious decay (unresistable disease debuff), no disease spell can
possibly be landed on them.
