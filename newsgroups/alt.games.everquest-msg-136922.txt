Well what other explanation is there?  Im damned if I know.. other than your
a total moron.  Btw im thrilled you have 6 characters above 50, dick wave
all you want, it doesn't really impress me though.  Lets see, 60monk (126aa
levels), 60 shaman, 60 cleric, 59 wizard, 54 Shadowknight, 53 magician.. btw
guess what, I make that 6 for me also.   Try and make sure you have a leg to
stand on before dick waving in the future, just some friendly advice

I've seen EVERY class sit at Sebilis zonein, Velks zonein etc calling LFG.
I've seen CLERICS and ENCHANTERS log off after an hour of being LFG, not to
mention the other classes who encounter it daily

Nope, to be honest the ratio of it kinda sucks for what stage my guild is at
now.   If I ever duelled a druid I wouldn't even use a 1hb, I figured
anybody with some experience of EQ would know that....  infact the first
time I ever mentioned my sap was talking to DK, about soloing Sebilis (and
having runner mobs)

With my primal bat (897 undisced damage in 1 round of attacks with a
successful tripple attack) and resists of 120+ in "fighting gear" (ie not
wearing any resist gear what so ever) I don't really think you'd worry me
too much.

Of course talking about killing me in a duel, when were not even on the same
server is pretty retarded, but hey, what more could we expect from mr
"druids NEED cheal" ? :)
