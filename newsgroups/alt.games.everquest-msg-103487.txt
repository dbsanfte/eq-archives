No, the skellies are only like level 5, but they have near 100% resists to
everything, a metric assload of hit points, double hit for around 350 IIRC
and are perma-rooted.

They're newbie guards, the only reason that they're level 5 and perma-rooted
is to allow people kos in Paineel to pass through safely to go to the
Warrens, Stonebrunt or the Hole.  They aren't intended to be killed.

Azzar Habib is like level 20 and is normal in terms of difficulty level.
Also in that area is Duriek Bloodpool, who's for the SK epic, I'm fairly
sure he's on TrueSpirit faction (as a lot of epic things are), I don't know
of anyone who's kos to him.
