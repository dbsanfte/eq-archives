Not always.  In fact, a greater light source is one whole helluva lot
better than infravision in quite a few places.  I play mostly Half
Elves, I am speaking from experience here.  If I turn up my gamma
enough to see clearly in places like the tunnels in Netherbian Lair
without a light source I still don't get decent contrast and 90% of
the zones in the game become visual misery.  Equip a greater light
source of some sort and I get the best of both worlds, good contrast
close up and good distance vision almost everywhere.

Depends on the zone.  Most outdoor zones are ok with infravision, and
some it's hard to tell day from night.  Some zones, especially some of
the newer ones, are very much improved by a good lightsource.  OTOH,
in many of the old outdoor zones a lightsource is nearly useless.

I use infravision all the time with my Half Elves.  And frankly I
rarely miss it with my Humans, unless I'm in old world outdoor
zones.

There is a lot of Paladin gear that gives off light (go figure), and
I've gotten so used to it on my Half Elf Paladin that I always make
sure that all of my other characters have a good light source whether
they have night vision or not.  Especially in Luclin zones, some of
them just plain suck without a greater light source (ultravision might
be ok for them, never checked them out with ultravision).
