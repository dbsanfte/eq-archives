I picked one of these up the other day on the cheap at the bazaar for my
necro cos i liked the stats on it and the 'gather shadows' is real useful as
i don't need to keep the spell memed. I remember reading that it had been
nerfed and that their were pre-nerfed ones still knocking about. How do you
tell if u have a nerfed or pre-nerfed one.
