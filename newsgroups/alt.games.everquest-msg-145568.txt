50+ rogues are awesome.  Wizards at high levels are too.

Pre-50 they both plain suck.  Starting slowly and working to become the most
powerfull class isn't a bad thing IMO.. and the only way id agree that <50
rogues should be beefed up, is if rogues lose the double backstab ability at
55.

Lets see how many rogues go for that.

Lock picker in the endgame (ssra), lock picker in the "upper levels"
(seb/hs), lock picker in the "early days" (befallen).. sorry, which range
did they exclude?

And not everybody can find a rogue for their group.  Most exp camps can be
done with a variation of classes (shaman for a cleric, bard/shaman for a
chanter, hybrid for a warrior etc).. locked doors and traps would DEMAND a
rogue in groups - and noway do I believe thats fair.

The point is, NO class should be absolutely necessary EVER.  Traps and
locked doors mean a rogue IS essential to the group, thats wrong imo.  Sure
make it faster/easier to have a rogue there, but don't make the place
exclusive to rogue groups.

Damn poor rogues!  They struggle to find a group pre 50, even tho 50-60 they
WALK into pretty much whatever group they want.

My mage could occ till he was blue in the face for a group, it rarely came.
My mage had to struggle on and solo, and unlike rogues, my mage is STILL
undesired in 99% of 50-60 exp camps.

And I still remember the days in Sebilis where my monk would sit at the
zonein for 3+ hours with /lfg on.

I can agree with that, but rogues versatility should not come at the cost of
restrictive gaming to every other class and group.
