The gear dropping on L55 missions is, by and large, inferior to
what the players at that level use, the +5 aug random drops are
infinitely more useful.  Almost every drop I've seen has been at
best a minor upgrade for an underequipped player.  None of it has
been nearly as good as my gear, and my gear is far from special.
The one item I ended up with was a Druid tunic slightly better
at its recommended level of 50 than a non-level restricted Druid
tunic commonly sold for 200pp in bazaar.  Most of the rest of it
has been less valuable than that.
