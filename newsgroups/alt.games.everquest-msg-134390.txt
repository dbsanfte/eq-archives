I did the patch first thing this morning, then again at about 11am EDT
(there were additional files downloaded).  I was in at about 130pm EDT, then
logged off at about 230pm.  I did a few /who all class and never saw more
than 18 of any class online withun the first 45 minutes.  People were having
trouble getting the patch and logging in.
