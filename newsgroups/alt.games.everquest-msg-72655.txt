there are people who can easily afford the chain mail 100 K + horses.  I'm
one of them.  Do I really want to spend that much on a horse, no.  Have I
been thinking about getting it?  some.

There definitely seems to be a problem with the economy, and I think that
putting horses that show prestige / help movement / works like property /
resellable is a step in the right direction.

people hoarding money and not spending and people not buying stuff implies
recession.   Makes sense for prices to drop so supply can move and demand
will increase.  Overall I think things are improving.

I think the bazaar is also going to be a step in the right direction.  The
biggest problems with the economy has been getting the seller and buyer
together.  Usually the Seller has to sit around waiting for a buyer to show
up, I think the bazaar will be fixing this.

Most big item trades are not traded using plat, but trades involving just
items / bartering.
