Playing my cleric (level 36 so no CH yet), I've considered going "x
heals left", and let the puller decide if that's enough for what he
wants to bring, but of course if the puller isn't tanking that might
not help much.  Not to mention that I do actually have more than one
heal, at different mana efficiency, so it's not really that simple
even for a low level cleric.

I usually go for "enough", "enough for a single", "just don't pull the
whole dungeon", that kind of thing.
