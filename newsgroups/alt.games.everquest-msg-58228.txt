It is possible for a level 1 Iksar to get all the way to Freeport
without getting killed. Honestly, you'd be better off leveling your
Iksar up to 5 or 6 first, which you can do in about 8 hours of /played
if you focus on doing the curscale armor and scorpion pincer quests.

As you enter the Field of Bone from Cabilis, hug the left wall. It is
oddly shaped, but a fairly safe run. Right about when your north
coordinate reaches +1000, you should zone into Warslik's woods.

The zone entrance is a mess and the hardest part of the trip. I
strongly recommend you get your bearings from the map at
http://eqatlas.com/kunark/warslikswoodsmap.html. You need to carefully
cross the entrance to its north wall. Watch out for the two goblins
that wander in the entrance, but once you are past them, hugging the
wall should get you to the shoreline.

Once at the shoreline, go into the water and swim, within sight of the
shoreline, as far west as you can. There's nothing in the water to
aggro you and you're far enough from the shore to avoid any wanderers.
Somewhere around the EW +4400 point, you won't be able to swim
anymore. Go back to shore and follow the zone wall south. There's an
occasional wanderer here, but you can avoid them by backing off and
waiting for them to move on. Again, hug the wall until you get to 0
north/south or so and you should zone into the Overthere.

Once in the overthere, you can walk out of the zone entrance until you
see a big, horking statue of an Iksar. Turn right so that you are
following the wall to the north. It will bring you to the shoreline.
Follow it until you get to the high walls of the Outpost. Swim around
the wall, hugging it the whole way, and wait on the beach. Eventually,
a boat will come into the zone. Swim to it. Everything in the Outpost
hates you, so be cautious.

The boat will take you into Timorous Deep. Wait until it comes to a
dock surrounded by ogres. Jump into the water and swim to the first
big rock next to the dock. The ogres will, of course, hate you. Give
them a wide berth.

Follow the shoreline to the second cay (traveling away from the huts
where the ogres live.) A raft will eventually appear. Wade out to it.
It will take you to the dock in Oasis. Rom there, follow the
shorleline right,  careful to avoid any undead or giants that might be
in the area. Crocs and their ilk won't mess with you if you don't mess
with them. You will eventually zone into North Ro. Follow the shore
until you reach the grassline. Follow the grassline until you get to
the mountainline. Follow the mountainline into the tunnel. The tunnel
takes you to East Commons. Turn right and, hugging the wall, you will
eventually zone into the newbie area of West Freeport.
