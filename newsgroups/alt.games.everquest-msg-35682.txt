    No, that's not the point. They had all of the first three Warders dead
on the ground *at the same time* - they cleared all three in less than 30
minutes.

    Do you believe, as Abashi has hinted, that there's a quest in ST to
"restore" the zone by recapturing the Sleeper?

    You need more copies of the spell? I was under the impression it rapidly
becomes one of the junk drops. Gage says, "Thanks for the Spell: Primal
Avatar, Tigole!"

    The "conspiracy guy" in me says that VI is actively trying to create
haves and have nots at the top of the totem pole on each server. It means
not only do you have a false sense of urgency to be "first" somewhere before
it's nerfed, you also have less conflicts between guilds as they're
stratified by nerfs. Allow me to provide examples:

    When a new expansion comes out, it is believed by the general EQ
populace that there WILL be loot issues that will be corrected later. Gem
Encrusted Rings in Kunark and the original swords dropping in Skyshrine are
good examples - not only were these items removed from the drop table,
nobody has seen them drop SINCE they were removed from the inappropriate
drop table. If you wanted a Gem Encrusted Ring, you had to buy Kunark soon
after it came out.

    Other things get nerfed too - difficulty. On my server, shortly after
the top guild was "finished" with PoG the drop rates there were lowered
quite a bit. Then, after the same top guild had farmed armour in ToV for a
while, the drop rate there (specifically the drops off the first eight mobs
in the entry hall) was also nerfed. They even joked that "if you want to get
the good stuff, you have to be with us when we go there". But it's true. And
the NEXT guild to go - the "second best" guild - has to spend more time in
that spot to get the same rewards. It separates top guilds so they don't end
up in direct competition as much.

    It would seem that the top guilds want it that way, too. When Dozekar
was lowered in difficulty, the first complaint out of LoS was that "anyone
can do this gimp dragon now, we need to race to get him". They know that the
solutions to competition VI provides usually benefit the guild that was
first to the goal. Huge example: the recent buffing of Klandicar. On my
server, Sontalak is undefeated, so Klan and Zlan were the sources of all ST
keys (Yelinak just recently has become a "solved dragon"). But there's a
problem - it's too easy to get Primal drops, and top guilds will compete for
them. VI solution? Make the KEYS harder to get, so it takes more work to get
into the reward zone that is Sleeper's and farm Primals. So the guild on my
server that had almost all ST keys gets separated from the non-key'ed
guilds, who all have to race to Zlandicar if they want a key - and yes, the
top guild races them to Zlan too. The *real* solution to "Primals are too
easy to get" would have been to make the source of Primals more difficult -
but then there would have been a logjam at the Warders for all guilds. Can't
have THAT.

    And it WILL be used as a weapon, for sure. If you're guild number one,
and guild number two looks almost ready to start farming Primals (or beats
you to even ONE Warder spawn), then drop the fourth and stop their
advancement cold. On my server the number two guild is actually being quite
resourceful - they've got the majority of the NToV server firsts for named
slayings, and this is without the ability to raid Sleeper's for Primals.
Eventually, though, they'll run into the limitations of their weapons.
