Anyone from the San Diego are care to confirm these power problems, since I
can find no mention of them on the tv stations and newspapers from the area.
Be nice if that is the case, but can never tell with these guys.  If it is I
feel sorry for the folks in San Diego, if not though will not be at all
surprised as disinformation is Verant's major vision.
