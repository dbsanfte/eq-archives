"Level one characters will see no benefit (since this morning's
Musical Servers didn't impact them), levels 2-10 are getting about a
bubble of experience, and experience roughly equivalent to twenty
yellow solo kills to all other characters."

This is a "FATAL" mistake.

The key to any MMRPG is the road the player travels. You don't "Win"
when you hit level 60 in EQ. You "Win" through all the
positive/negatice experiences you have along the way and the
friends/enemies you make.

Sure it sounds great to get free experience, and it gives the
appearance that Mythic really cares, but the truth is they just
cheapened and undermined the game.

DAoC is the lesser game for it.
