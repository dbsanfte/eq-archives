first, what the hella-smella are people planning on doing? i'm under 10, so
i'm just plain stuck in the karanas / qeynos area, and everywhere the goods
are raiding and the good/newt relationship is just plain sour. there's no
maturity to speak of, and its frustrating. i doubt its more fun in other
areas, but WTF? its just plain pointless. an evil gal (45 ) came into BB and
just plain handed it to the newts ( woohoo ! ) because she too got
frustrated with everyone bitching. so . . .  ? what are the other newts
doing? is good a bunch of jackasses everywhere else? and is evil going to be
cheered into dominating the world? what's the global atmosphere?

and following, where do under 15s fight? i can't remember how i ever made it
through these lvls. can you gain exp without a spawn? is this possible ?
karanas too big, BB in turmoil, QeyHills slow and dreary . . . oh, blimey !

unrelated : (never been a rogue before)
if i pickpocket an NPC while grouped, do my group members get a message
either way?
and
if i pickpocket a PC , does that person get a message if i succeed?

is lockpick completely useless, or does it amuse people at parties?

is there ANY way a ranger can beat a rogue ? (snicker)



~chris, a guy who now plays pvp
i'd be a monk, but even the biggest jackass PC can tell what a feign death
is
