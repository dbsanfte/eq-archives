While it is true that it is his decision, and btw, I don't agree with
putting warning labels on everything, I think part of the responsibility is
the user's friends and family.  What is rather ridiculous, is the fact that
with this company for 'Computer Addiction' doesn't fess up to, is the fact
it is a person's family that should help encourage breaking the addiction,
not just the gaming companies.  Look at the facts with Alcohol Addiction,
it has been the oldest problem out there and there is no warning label on
any of the alcoholic drinks stating you could get addicted to it.  Same
with cigarettes and smoking, another addiction that isn't listed with a
warning label persay stating you could get addicted, just a warning about
some of the side effects and the Surgeon General's warning.

Hell, use of the computer is addicting.  Most people will keel over in
college if their computer ate their paper or they couldn't do their paper
on the computer because of exacting standards colleges and univerisities
want you to do things.  Hand written Report?  Automatic fail.  Must be type
written and double spaced for legibility.  So, should we start putting on
warning labels on College Applications of "Warning:  Going to College may
be stressful to your social life." or "Warning: Using a computer may get
you addicted to using it."?

I admit to being a computer addict, since I seem to be on it more than
anything else, but I also try to walk away from it, socialize with people
in front of me.  I admit to getting pissed off while playing games, like
Multiplayer FPS games, but then, most people get pissed off when their
fricken Football/Hockey team screws up too.  So... Should we put warning
signs on Sport events as well?

The lady wants to know information on her son's online activites.  All fine
and dandy, but the real issue is, how much does Sony know.  Sure, they can
give her her son's login information, but have to verify this is the case.
Beyond that, they can't tell her what he was doing unless he was a real SOB
and got marked by CS for something.

The lawyer, though...  Is an ass.  Fiscally responsible for making an
addictive game.  Excuse me if I don't cough up a lung and offer my heart
for a transplant to a needy person, but all in all, any game is addicting.
IRC is 'addicting' in the definition of how they define his personality.
In the electronic playground we call the internet, it is addicting because
a lot of people are surfing it for that instant gratification, so,
shouldn't we just put a big ass label across the internet saying, "Warning:
Being on the Internet may be addicting." while we are at it, and sue the
government for making it possible to get people socially crutched?  Come
on, Mr. Lawyer...  If we are going to milk this, let's be completely
stupid.

On the lighter note...  I did hear that a judge in England through out a 39
person lawsuit against McDonalds over the stupid 'Hot coffee' incident they
had as well, citing that you ordered Hot Coffee, and you should have every
expectation of getting burned by 'Hot Coffee'...
