I have had nothing but headaches trying to get it to run smoothly (same
problems as you described, couldn't determine the cause of the probs but i
didn't delve to deeply into what might have caused it to screw up on me) so
I gave up and started running winamp in the background of eq.
No problems running two windows of eq and winamp at same time with a
1gigmhz/516mbram system with a really crappy integrated soundcard. Can still
hear all the sounds on both accts of eq at same time along with the music
and don't run into any  memory problems so i don't find the hassle of the
built in mp3 player to be worth it.
