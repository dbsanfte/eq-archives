Enter the Promised Land, an abermud like other abermuds but with great
differences.  The land features...

Four different dieties to follow and receive gifts from.

Multiple training centers to learn your class of character.

Quickstart options for those who want to run right away and not deal
with planning the stats of a character yet.

Three levels of difficulty, combined with levelless mode, six!

Full bodypart fighting.

On occasion, we hold full player-kill tournaments, capture the flag,
scrabble, poker, hide and seek, trivia.

New, verbose fight messaging that doesn't get reptitive.

67 different quests, some classic, some unique, some customized.

Over 130 areas to explore with a variety of enemies to battle and
items to find and use.

All who have been shunned from everywhere else, like AOL, the Finns,
and the Koreans, are welcome to play here.  For those who scoff at
paying a monthly rate to play, the Promised Land is free.  And yes, we
do mentoring for those who seek it.
