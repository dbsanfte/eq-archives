Royal Attendant BP is a very very good choice. Im very happy with mine. Far
superior to ornate BP with the crappy right click. Good to hold you over
untill you can get a EP/Time BP someday. I agree that clerics get passed
over on many items that can be given to warriors but thats fine IMO. Clerics
have a monopoly on FT drops and of course healing focus items.

Nothing wrong with a 100hp/mn BP with FT2 =)
