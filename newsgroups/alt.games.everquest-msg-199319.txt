	Interpersonal bonds break.  How *old* are you?

	The kind of behavior you are talking about exists only in the Perfect
Guild, which meets in the Perfect Guildhall, right next to the Perfect House
where the Perfect Couple enjoy the Perfect Marriage with their Perfect Kids,
in the Perfect Neighborhood..on the Plane of Platonic Ideals, where we may
also find the Perfect Rock, the Perfect Tree, and the Perfect Chair.  We will
not, however, find the Perfect Ass there, as you have so graciously consented
to appear here for our convenience.
