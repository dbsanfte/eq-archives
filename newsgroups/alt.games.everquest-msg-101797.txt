AO still has its fair share of bugs and balancing issues but it's a heck of 
a lot better now than it was before, and it's very playble. There's still 
some features that are not implemented correctly or just plain missing, but 
nothing that's so bad as to prevent me from enjoying what they have now. 
The main missing elements that are purported to be in a patch "sometime 
real soon now" are Team Missions (these would be very difficult missions 
that are geared to challenge an entire team of characters, with 
substantially greater rewards), and of course, trade skills (why is it 
trade skills are always the red-headed step children of MMORPGs?). They 
have improved trade skills from the launch version, but they're still not 
really profitable. They can be a useful way to make your own equipment, but 
you'd probably be better off just getting them from missions.

The graphics are the best I've seen out of DAoC and pre-Luclin EQ (haven't 
played Luclin yet, though based on the screenies, AO is still better). It 
seems like I never see 2 toons that look identical.. lot of variety in what 
to wear. In fact, there's a whole "fashion" sub-game of trying to impress 
people with new outfits. There's a fairly wide variety of terrain but I 
admit the terrain is not quite as varried as it is in EQ (what EQ really 
has going for it is all the cool environments). It's a lot more variety 
than DAoC, though, IMHO. The environmental effects are fantastic, also. The 
mobs themselves are sometimes great, sometimes kind of weak.

AO is the most soloable of any MMORPG I've ever played. You can randomly 
generate "missions" according to a difficulty rating and other parameters 
that you desire, including chosing your own rewards for that mission. So, 
if I need new armor, I can go to a mission booth and keep "rolling" new 
missions until I get one that has the armor I'm looking for. Grouping is 
still a lot of fun, of course, and you can gain experience faster with it. 
So basically it boils down to using groups for fast leveling, and using 
solo runs for improving equipment and/or gaining wealth. Which is good, 
because I spend my time grouping when friends are online and spend my time 
getting stuff and money when I'm alone, I never really HAVE to try and find 
a group of strangers unless I just want to.  Also, while missions ARE 
primarily aimed at the single character (right now), you CAN still make 
copies of the "mission key" and take friends to help out on tough missions 
if you want to. Only the character that actually got the mission from the 
mission terminal gets the mission reward at the end, however, but both will 
get experience and loot from the mobs killed and from chests. Sometimes a 
buddy and I will bump up the mission difficulty really high and team up to 
beat them. We take turns on doing each others missions so we both get 
the end-rewards.

One new feature that is being planned that I'm really excited about is the 
concept of "reroll points". Basically you can get these "rerolls" which you 
can use a limited number of times to reset a skill or stat down to it's 
base level and give you back all the IP (improvement points) you spent 
building up that stat. So basically, if they decided to nerf some skill and 
it screws up your character, all is not lost. You can spend some of your 
reroll points (which are supposed to be available as quest rewards) and 
just drop that stat and reallocate the points to stats or skills you want 
to use instead. And another good use for it is if you decide you have 
gotten the character as high as you are going to or need to, but want to 
continue playing it as a trade-skill character, you can reroll your combat 
stats and reallocate the points into trade-skill stats. There are other 
uses, of course, but the idea is a nice tool to help players recover from 
the big, bad, nerf stick. :)

I'm still fairly new in the game, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. Worth 
the $13, IMHO. At least it's not the same old tired fantasy cliche, which 
can be fun too, but I'm just not in that kind of mood ATM.
