Perhaps they should give all melee newbies a Funghi Tunic and Ssra class
weapons as their starting item ?

What gets me with all these threads about this fix (perceived nerf) of
Koadic's is that until Luclin came out no one at all complained that C2 +
Enlightenment + Gift of Brilliance wouldn't land on people below lvl 46.
These three buffs combined give nearly the same amount of regen as KEI with
a Mana pool int/wis buff also. Why is that you think? It is because people
accepted it. People accepted they were not yet powerful enough to have these
spells. If you think it through logically in tune with spell line
progression then KEI shouldn't be landing on people below lvl 55 but SoE
kept it at 45.

The problem with KEI/Aego/Focus group bug is that it has continued for too
long. It should have been fixed when the bug was first discovered so that
people didn't get used to the crutch. Why work for a living when you can get
social security and do fuck all ?

Give all casters some form of mana regen? That would be nice providing of
course all casters got some form of healing. If you check your spell lists
then all other casters except enchanters get some form of self buff mana
regen. Druid, PotC, Necros Lich, Shaman Canni etc.. Enchanters are the only
caster class without a self buff mana regen to stack with KEI etc.

People burdened by donations for KEI ? I suspect that you are a dr00d of
some sort. Druids/Wizards burdened by the donations for ports?
Clerics/shaman burdened by donations for buffs? I do not play /anon or
/role. I am proud I have a LVL65 Coercer and do not want to hide it. because
of that I get tells constantly from everywhere in Norrath/Luclin/Planes
asking for KEI. Just say no? fine.. doesn't stop the initial intrusion does
it. doing the Bertox event a constant hour or so of
killing/mezzaing/charming without respite with constant tells begging for
KEI. Buffs for money is no new thing. 3 years ago I was handing Enchanters
money for Breeze/Clarity.

Everquest is a grouping game, that was how it was designed and that is how
it is meant to be. If you don't want to group then you have to accept the
downside of awaiting mana regen. How many complaints would there be if
melees could walk out into the field kill four mobs and sit for a brief
moment while their entire health bar regenerated like mana does with KEI ?
If you want mana regen then group with an Enchanter for their skills, spell
lines and of course mana regen spell.

Mummy and Daddy have snatched away a lot of spoiled bratz sweeties and they
are all crying and whining.
