This is wildly subjective and dependant on so many factors that a 
universal answer is impossible.

For an answer applicable to only 95% of the characters out there, 
however, its easy.  100% AA when far enough into level 51 to not lose 
level on death.  Wait till you have 3 AA, all in Run, then 0% until at 
-least- level 56, unless you need to do Naggy/Vox, in which case, hit 
level 53, then go 100% AA, and stay there till you are done with the 
dragons; every time you actually go on a dragon run, arrange to die, 
which will drop you back to 52, and hopefully get a rez after to get you 
back to 53.

There's no reason, ever, to do anything but 100% AA or 100% "real" exp, 
unless perhaps you are level 65, and plunk a small amount into "real" in 
order to offset occaisional deaths.

Depending on class, I'd generally suggest not getting any more AA till 
65; the higher your level the easier each AA point is to get, generally, 
and levels tend to be much more effective than a few AA points; AA are 
only massively effective when large numbers of points are spent on them.

Ranger would be an obvious exception, where the combination of EQ and AM 
are so massively effective that stopping at 59 to get them is more 
effective than waiting and doing those next 6 levesl without.

And Run 3 is so effective for most classes that its generally worth 
stopping at 51 or 52 to get.  Its only 3 points, and even run 1 and run 
2 are big improvements over normal running speed.  This is less true 
now, what with the Shrew spells (and bard equivalent) being in the game, 
but still, the difference between Run 3 and Shrew is like the difference 
between worn EB and buff EB: Run 3 is there when you need it, every 
time, without fail, never wearing off or getting dispelled.

I don't know enough about SK or their high level AA to comment 
specifically.  Run 3, however, seems like a given for a class that 
doesnt' have SOW and is decently designed to solo and to work as puller 
for groups or raids.

My mage is a Baron, which is to say 6 AA, due to stopping for a naggy 
kill and to let friends catch up a bit.  I've been very happy with Regen 
3, to my surprise, but then again, mages have no self heal, dont get hit 
a lot, have crappy HP totals, and rely on regen, racial plus self buff, 
to heal most wounds.  Adding 3 points of regen had noticable effect, I 
doubt it would be nearly as exciting for a melee class.
