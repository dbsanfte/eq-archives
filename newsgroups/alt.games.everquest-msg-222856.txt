I've never had any trouble looting while using different camera views.
Matter of fact, sometimes it's easier with one of the other view.

Camera 1) First-person view.

Camera 2) Overhead view.  Always starts out looking straight down, but can
be adjusted to look forward by changing the angle.  Also can be repositioned
from just above your head to about the level of a giant's head.

Camera 3) Behind you.  This one stays behind you at all times.  It can be
varied as to how far behind.

Camera 4) Positional.  I set this one out a fair distance, about 10 feet
above the ground, facing North.  Can be brought closer or further, and you
can change the height above ground.  I believe it always points directly at
the character; you cannot change the angle.  (Not sure about this as I
haven't played with it for a long time.)

Camera 5) Positional.  I set this one similar to 4, but facing West.

Camera 6) Trailer.  This one follows along behind you as you move.  If you
stop and turn around, however, you're now facing it.  You can then run past
it and it'll turn to follow you.  It's like being followed by your brother.
Not sure if there are any mods for this one.
