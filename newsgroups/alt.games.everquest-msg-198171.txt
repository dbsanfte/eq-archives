Rofl. Please tell me this ther cleric isn't on Bristlebane. Wouldn't
want to accidentally group with anyone that has that kind of an
attitude.

 Well, problem is that most tanks I know are _that_  butt ugly, 50
would probably be pushing it <g>. Hell, I think the SKs even try for
low charisma. 

Not worth registering on EQClerics for but I'll check with some of our
server's uberclerics to see what they know. They'll either tell me or
I shall taunt them some more about not being able to solo a pidly
Guardian Wurm! :p 

Thanks for the info, though. Our regular grouping cleric can be kinda
slow on the trigger sometimes on the nastier fights, I get the feeling
she might want to play around a bit with that spell. Since we always
cover her components at the end of the day, cost isn't really an
issue. 

Rgds, Frank

PS: if anyone out there has the super sekrit info and wouldn't mind
e-mailing it, I can be reached @compuserve.com, just put 'fegerter'
before the @.
