Hail Rumbledor!!!

I had this same problem with my DE cleric.  She could get into efp and wfp
okay but the merchants wouldn't sell to her, nor could she consider getting
into North Freeport.  So...how to solve this without ruining hometown
faction?  I tracked down some quests at alakazams that made it so that I
could cheerfully enter any part of freeport, including the tunnels, and sell
and bank effectively without ruining any faction.

Remember, turning in orc belts to the captain at the freeport militia raises
nfp faction but LOWERS efp and wfp faction so that is not a viable option.

To raise NFP faction and NOT lower any other faction do this, I saw it at
Alakazams under the quest "Not for Janam" but it was in comments, not in the
quest.  I am copying the entire comment below:

No, for the Knights of truth, which means the north freeport guards, do not
kill orcs in EC go find Fabian, an npc in east freeport at the Grub and Grog
tavern,(number 7 on the eqatlas map). Once you find him, you give him 2gp
and it will give you this faction:

+League of Antonican Bards(Bards all around Norrath)
+Queynos Guards(Most of the guards in Queynos)
+Knights of truth(Pally guild and north freeport guards)
-Ring of scale(Dragons on Kunark)

This is great for any people who want to be able to raise there faction with
north freeport guards(and access to bank) and Norrathian Bards. With 600gp
you should be able to go from kos to apprehensive or dubious to Knights of
truth and kos to amiable or indifferent to bards. Please don't do this quest
for Queynos Guards because it is very slow going and you will spend alot of
money, kill gnolls instead. If you are kos to freeport, have someone wolf
form you for this, or do the invis trick.

Note: If you don't want to stay with bad faction with Kunark dragons, kill
gargoyles in Ocean of tears.

  Good luck to you all, hope this prevents people form killing a million
orcs in EC. :)

I did the above and managed to get apprehensive in NFP for my DE cleric with
1000 gold pieces.

Now, to raise East and West fp faction without lowering anything else do
this: (This is the "Note for Janam" and "Note for Rebby" Quest simplified
and mashed together for us DE.

Note: if you are not a DE or "evil" race i wouldn't suggest going in the
freeport tunnels.  Also, these instructions use gate.  Otherwise you got to
run around the long way.

1. Bind in west freeport near Janam and Rebby's (near theatre of the
tranquil...they're the dwarf and elf hanging out near the tent).

2. Swim into the tunnels from docks and locate Harkin. (he's a dwarf)  Ask
him "what message?" and get his note.  Travel up and find Nestral T'Gaza (a
dark elf) and get her note by saing "What Janam and Rebby's?"   (The tunnel
entrance in east freeport is out in the water (I suggest swimming since
baitmaster guy will kos you).  Jump off dock and swim right.  Look at the
wall and wait until it changes to a normal looking wall.  The entrance is
there.)

3.  Gate back, give notes to proper individuals.  They will give you a note
and some whiskers in return.

4. Head to East fp and swim back into tunnels.

5. Bring note back to harking and say "what message?".  Bring whiskers back
to T'Gaza and ask "what Janam and Rebby's?"

Continue to 3.

That should get your efp/wfp faction up after a dozen or so times.



Hope this helps!!
