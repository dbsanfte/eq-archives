Well, sure! If it was a piece of software that I used for my business.
But, guess what? EQ is a game! They add more features for fun, and
glitches aren't going to cost a company thousands of dollars. *shrug*
The fact that 400+K people still fork over $10/month means they're
doing something right, doesn't it? Heck, I'm annoyed when patches run
over and require emergency re-patches, yeah. But it's not worth
getting worked up over. If I really, really didn't like the fact that
the servers came down during a period I was paying for, I'd stop
paying and find a new hobby. I certainly wouldn't waste time and
effort screaming and moaning somewhere where no one has any say in the
company that makes the game...
