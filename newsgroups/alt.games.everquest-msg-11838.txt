The zone is not slow because of the swaying trees... the movement of
ANYTHING will not slow your system down one little bit.  Look at it
this way, if you are in an area where the trees dont move, but you are
walking or turning around, to your computer, the trees, as well as
everything else, is moving.  You video card is having to move
everything from point xyz to point xyz, and if the trees are swaying,
the video card doesn't know the difference from that, than if you were
walking.

The thing that slows warslike down is the number of trees.  The big
problem with the everquest 3d engine is that it doesn't have any
object viewable logic in it.  When you are standing in front of a
brick wall in the game, even though you can't see past it, the engine
is still making your video card draw everything behind that brick
wall.  They need some logic code in there so that if you cant see it,
dont draw it.  They could at least double the speed of the game if
they did this, but they wont because I dont think they have the right
to do it.  I bet they outsourced the design and creation of that
engine for the game, and they have to go back and shell out the cash
to get it updated, and they aren't about to spend any more money on
this game unless they make some off of it.
