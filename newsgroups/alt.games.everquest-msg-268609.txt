I hear this same refrain everytime a new mmorpg comes out, but have yet to 
hear a single example in game of anyone complaining about a lack of thees 
and thou's.  Not once in 5+ years.  OTOH I have been bitched at (on a 
'nonRP' server in a rpg) because they didnt like my dwarven brogue.  Seems 
to me the RP'ers are much more flexible than the non-rp'ers.  All I ask of a 
RP environment is no talking about the election, football, or how much dorfs 
suxxor.  Is that too much to ask for?  This is another area btw that wow has 
eq beat hands down.
