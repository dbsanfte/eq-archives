The reclaim technique is tried and true.  When the pet dies any damage he's
done becomes unattributed, just as DS damage is.  One of the big advantages
of this method is that you can take a mob down to where it runs, reclaim,
recast then pull another while your friend is working on the first one.
 
A level 24 earth pet (or focused level 24 water pet) has 830HP.  If you
reclaim one at full health you'll get 83mana back.  They have a base
cost of 240.  If you can get one of the following items: 
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1362
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10346
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1357
that cost drops to 180 (less about 6 more for a conj. spec. of 50)
This leaves you with only 91-157 mana to regen between fights.

At level 24 you have a med skill of 125, for a mana regen of 11
per tick. So your best case scenario is a pet every 48 seconds
until your malachite runs dry.  This is only true if the
shaman is tanking, of course.  Something that is obviously very
beneficial to her, even if it slows down leveling a bit.  

I'd definitely get my Stein of Ulyssa soonest.  With it
you have the single best tank-pet and insta reclaim.  The
torch and broom are next in preference (IMO) and the
shovel is last.

Oh, if your defense isn't maxed right now, I recommend
using the needlites in Echo to max it before you go
above 28 or so.  They will be low dark-blue still at
28-29.  Wait until you friend has 24 regen+19 heal, then
have her heal you while you get beat on.  You really
must take the opportunity these light/fast hitting
mobs provide to max your defense before you can't take
the hits any more.

One last thing, I seem to recall you saying you had
to PL her to 18.  I may be mis-remembering, but even
so, you only need her to get to 16 to group with you.
