There's no point reasoning with him. He thinks HE'S the one who's been
dissed here, because he made the stupid mistake of thinking I was
knocking everyone who plays a lot. If he knew me better he wouldn't do
something like that.

The fact he's now on the attack over what amounts to the very same
sort of mistake is drining the batteries on my irony meter.
