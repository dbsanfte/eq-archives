go to the guy who tells you your progression
if you missed any steps you have to do them
after you get all 10 or 12 or whatever many steps you have, you are done.
there isn't a huge reward for the quest as far as i can tell, i got a jade
or something =p

the only thing i thought might be a further quest was if you wore full newb
armor they might talk to you more, but i haven't tested that and probably
won't.
