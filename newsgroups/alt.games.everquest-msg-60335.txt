That's nothing -- try the Inert Potion quest in Erudin.  It gives
the same faction bumps, but you can do it every 3-4 seconds if you
set things up just right.  For a questaholic, it's the "hard stuff".

She's part of the Paladin epic weapon quest.

Tell her, "I will take it to him" (or something like that, maybe
"I will carry it"  or whatever).  She'll give you the bucket of
water for her sick brother.  He's very close by, in the back room
of Brownloe's Bakery.  His name is Jacob, I believe.  Give him
the water, and he'll do some magic on it and give you a bucket
of "pure water".  It's used to purify one of the quest items
needed for the Fiery Defender.


>I need some kind of intervention to send me back out hunting

Heck, I spent almost three full weeks doing nothing but
questing repeatedly to get my Dwarf Paladin on good terms
with Cabilis.
