NA and not sure what you are talking about jumping on the bandwagon.
SOL and its problems are totally non related, this is a newly hired
team for that server only which will be paid for with the 29 bucks
extra people pay for that server.

No

No, its a seperate server. If you pay the 29 bucks more a month you
can use it and all the old servers too. You can move up to 8 of your
chars free to the Legends server as a one shot deal, then move them
back to their old server for free if you don't like it there and go
back to your old 9.89 subscription price. The 8 characters can all be
from different servers and go to the legends server (you can't have
more than 8 because they would not all show)

All it is is more CS attention and GM questing, with a map and your
char portrait with items worn on a web server they run and an events
calender for the server. Its the same game otherwise. Your $29 bucks
more per month would pay for more hired bodies for that server in
particular and the web server costs. They are a totally seperate team
from the people on the regular EQ servers who are in charge of fixing
luclin or such.

Its nothing to do with SOL.
