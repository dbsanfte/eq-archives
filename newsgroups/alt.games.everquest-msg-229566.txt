lol, but making tempers is way under my skill level, and  many times 
making coldain vel tempers is the longest and most boring part of 
smithing...or making cod oil, or making amy other subcombine for 
smithing, brewing, poterymaking, baking...

you cant tell me all those people in bazaar with 500 misty picnics 
havent made them until they are so trivial that they feel like one more 
set of combines their brains will leak out of their ears...
