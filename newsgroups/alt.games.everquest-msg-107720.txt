Still, it strikes me as kind of stupid that you would want something nerfed
so you can get it for cheaper.  If it is nerfed doesn't that also make it of
less value to you?  So you are getting something cheaper because it is
worth-less.  In the grand scheme of things asking for nerfs WILL hurt you
since eventually you also will get hit with the nerf bat.  When you grow out
of your childesh selfishness then you will understand.
