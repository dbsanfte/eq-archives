    And that was a good thing. In a game where everyone in a given level 
range is in the same place, travel can be a big deal filled with adventure. 
In a game like Everquest, where people are spread out all over the place, 
travel time just pisses people off. The game I want to play involves facing 
challenges and meeting folks, not hitting numlock and getting out a book 
while hoping the people who wanted to group with me are still there a half 
hour later. Do you even remember how totally obnoxious it was getting to a 
place like Temple of Veeshan during SoL, when if you didn't find a druid or 
wizard with nothing better to do you were SOL?
