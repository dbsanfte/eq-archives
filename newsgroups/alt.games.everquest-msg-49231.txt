And?

For that definition to be appropriate in this case, there would have to be a
"combination of circumstances" which was "opposite of what might be
expected" (according to the definition you so handily supplied).

Only there's not.

The "combination of circumstances" was that I had supplied reasoning for my
positions, whereas your argument consisted of "my statement is accurate, and
yours is not." (again, thanks for providing the quote).  I indicated that
this sort of debate technique is the sure sign of a loser.  For irony to be
present in this case, I would had to have been guilty of the same offense I
was accusing you of- I'd have to make brilliant arguments along the lines of
"Is so!".

But I didn't do that. So there's no irony. But I do commend you on taking
the time from your busy schedule to look up and type in the definition of
the word.

PS- "function intellect of curdled yogurt".  Very witty.
