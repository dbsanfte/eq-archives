No, we aren't talking about roleplayinng.  We're talking about people
who meet and hang out together night after night, who talk about how
their day has been, how their boss is a jerk or the latest movie
they've seen.  Exactly what they'd talk about if they were dating, in
fact.

Very few people roleplay on EQ, we are all just ourselves, only
instead of bowling together we're all getting eaten by a dragon.
