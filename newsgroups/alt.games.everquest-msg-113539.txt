No, actually, *YOU* are the current asshole class in EQ. You and
people like you who label an entire group based on some flimsy and
mindless 'evidence' that you mostly make up to start with.

Maybe in your honor I'll do something new for the next few weeks. Any
time someone asks me for a SoW, I'll decline with a message telling
them that I no longer SoW people because of the comments
cannon@panix.com has made about druids being assholes.

Maybe the occasional enlightened one will let you know how they feel
about your infantile opinion.
