Going home for Christmas and wanted to play EQ on my mom's computer (and
possibly get her into the game) and wondering if it will work.

She has a Pentium 350, 64MB RAM, Diamond Fusion 32MB Video Card and a crappy
sound card that I don't remember.  And a modem connection.

If I just install the original EQ will it work on that computer?  Also how
should I go about that?  My two options are:

1. Download the free 30 day trial and just goof around on there.

2. I have EQ Trilogy, and I could just install the original skins from it
and not Velious and Kunark.  Will that simulate a lower-grade install of EQ?
