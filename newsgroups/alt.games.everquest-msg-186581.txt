EQ does not utilise DX9, only couple of MS games (Freelancer and Impossible
Creatures) insist you install it. So you wont see any changes. DX9 has
features added for the new high end GFX cards for their pixel shading etc...

You would see HUGE benefits from extra 256mb ram and again with a further
256mb making 750mb system ram. You will see better game play from the system
ram mroe immediately than GFX card. Even with your new snazzy GFX card you
would be left with the minimal options for GFX because of system ram
limitations.
