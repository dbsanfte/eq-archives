Nice bit of sophistry.  In the end, though, the fact that God knows what
you're going to do has no bearing on the fact that it is -you- that chooses
to do it.  If I chose to do things differently, He would see the things I
chose to do instead.  I determine the future He sees for me.  So, once
again, my actions are my responsiblity, not His.
