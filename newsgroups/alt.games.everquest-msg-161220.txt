Off the original toon list, but as a followup....

The lowest bard song is 42, but it's a very big one in terms of what it
means to the Bard class. I call it downright HUGE to those in the 42-45
range. There is another song at 50.

Why so big? The 42 is a full blown chant - which gives you 3x chant ability
at 42 instead of 46. It gives you three "big" chants at 46 instead of Flame,
Frost, and the lower Curtailing. It utilizes a different resist save
(Disease) - which means that you have another option when other chants are
being resisted.  Now, add in the Poison chant at 50 and you have yet another
resist option to work with.

In The Grey for example, there are several things that are major MR and even
FR - limiting options. But I now can stick chants on things I never could
before - I just need to learn the right chants for the right mobs. Nice
stuff.
