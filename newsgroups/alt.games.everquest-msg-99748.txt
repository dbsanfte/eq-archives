Hmm, curiouser and etc.

I was going to followup offering support to Briarroot, since my
c:\temp folder was unharmed (Not that I'd miss the contents, just
some Sims stuff I haven't touched in a long time). But then I
remembered that I haven't been playing from this machine in a
week or so, so the problem might have been introduced very
recently.

I decided to do a little digging, and found the following strings
in Everquest.exe (The patcher):

0xEB1A8: c:\Temp
0xEB1B5: c:\Temp

Hmm, it seems as if Verant have decided that nuking commonly-used
directories is Good Programming Practice... No direct references
to directory deletion there[1], but the circumstantial evidence is
pretty damning...

In the meanwhile, people should assume that nothing in that dir is
safe from VI.

[1] Well, none that I can interpret. If I could read hexadecimal
assembly language, I could possibly find out exactly what those
strings are used for, but gimme a break already!
