Hmmm, if you're a full-service grocer who's been able to engage
in profiteering by selling a lot more milk than you would have
otherwise to folks who don't have access to drinking water, and
the local authorities finally get the water system working, do
you have anything remotely resembling a legitimate complaint?

Grow up and smell the roses.  If all being a Druid means to you
is skinning other players for ports then I've got even less
sympathy for you than I do for Ingot's pathetic whine.

Go out, get a group, learn how to be one of the few Druids who're
welcome anywhere there're players with IQs above room temperature.
It might be hard at times to find players who aren't idiots to
group with, but it'll be impossible if you insist on being one of
the idiots yourself.  Once you're a credit to your class go find
a guild that's worth a damn.  By then you'll be too busy having
fun to engage in bullshit whining like you did here.
