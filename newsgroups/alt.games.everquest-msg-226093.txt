I followed the guides I found online for doing the Coldain Military
Wristguard quest.  All went well until I turned in the bridle to the
Broodmother.  I had a partner at the opening to the Coldain Caves to watch
Korf pop, then repop.

The Broodmother got to the caves, but Korf never showed up.  A druid friend
had him on track the whole time in the caves, but he never depopped from his
place in the caves.  After about 10 minutes the Broodmother left the cave
entrance and headed back to the shardwurm caves.  I decided to try and and
kill the Broodmother at this point...it was resistant to all spells I cast
on her ( I'm a 57 Necro).

Does anybody know if this quest is broken, or what I may have done
incorrectly?  Thanks for helping!
