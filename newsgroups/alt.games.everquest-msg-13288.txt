That bonus has me thinking about an upcoming upgrade on my weapons I'm
looking into.  For quite some time I've been using the crystallized 2 hander
(24/49 no proc) but a guild brother just acquired for me one of the new BIBS
from runnyeye that is 24/39.  I should be picking it up tonight.  Now, of
course at first I was like, "Ten less delay! WOO HOO!"  but I'm beginning to
wonder.  Will I be losing out on that "greater than 40 delay" bonus to the
point where I might not want to make this change? Anybody run a comparison
on a weapons analyzer yet?
