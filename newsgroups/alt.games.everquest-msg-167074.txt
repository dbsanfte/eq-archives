I remember when I was a wee warrior hunting in Oasis, killing crocs etc.
Normally I camped on the docks, never a problem to come back the next day.
I log on one day and *WHAM* sand giant starts beating the tar out of me.
And I am quickly killed.  I pop back in Freeport and head back out to get
my corpse... *sigh* and people wonder why we tell them not to train to the
docks.
