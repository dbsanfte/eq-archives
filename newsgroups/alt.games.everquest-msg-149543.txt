Hmmm, just a guess, but try updating your BIOS to the latest
version.  It may help.

I think you can temporarily overwrite LILO (I think the command
is "fdisk c: /mbr", but check the web to be sure), then install
XP, then reinstall LILO (you may want to have Linux boot disks
or a bootable Linux CD handy before you try this, of course).

Speaking as a software developer, I can assure you that from a
technical perspective, Windows 2000 and Windows XP are far and
away superior to Windows 98; however, game companies probably
worry (worried?) about 98 compatibility more than 2K/XP, so
from a gamer's perspective, 98 may still be the right choice.

Good luck.  :)
