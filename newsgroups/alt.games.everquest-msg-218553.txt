Hmm, I never knew I was devolving into doodspeak when I use "?", I
thought I was just being a lazy typist. :p 

Question about the usage of 'plz.  If we're crawling a dungeon and I
have the point I'll just type a simple "move" to let the party know to
move up to where I am while a friend of mine will always type  "follow
me plz". Even with his usage of 'plz', I'd say he's being a lot more
polite than I am.

I don't have a problem with bailing out on a group if someone is
really annoying but doing it in the middle of combat or letting a
person die because of it is one of my pet peeves.
