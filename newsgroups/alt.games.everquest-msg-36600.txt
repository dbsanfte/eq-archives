Actually, bards have a meditate skill of 10.  It made memorizing songs
much faster, so know it only takes us 5 times as long as any other
caster to load 8 songs, rather than the 20 times as long it used to
take.
Manasongs do not affect bard mana, and as far as I can tell NOTHING
other than time and sitting affects bard mana.  I have had necros
twitch me and have seen no change at all.  I can't remember if I've
tried a mod-rod, but I strongly expect that they don't work either.
You say that you tried the level 20 song and the level 32 manasong,
but don't mention catata at level 34, so I'm wondering how you're
using mana for charms unless you're already level 39.  If you've taken
a bard from 7 to 39 in one week, I hate you very very much.
