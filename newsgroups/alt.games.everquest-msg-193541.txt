Agreed!  it's totaly BS that the WWF had to change their name b/c of some
other younger company who hasn't been around anywhere near as long as the
WWF wins a lawsuit b/c they are some POS Wildlife Fund!  Total BS!  But,
thats the world we live in, kill an animal & get locked up in prison, kill
an unborn baby and your considered a hero.  Something seriously wrong here
in this world.  Womans rights movement started out for the right reasons and
has turned into a Facist Radical movement that destroys good and embraces
evil.  Why can't people just be adults and just simply do whats right & live
by The Word of God & be happy?  Well, I suppose whatever the wrath of God
serves to mankind is well deserved in many aspects.

The world is getting so blasted corrupt and evil, too bad we won't be free
of it for an unknown time to come.
