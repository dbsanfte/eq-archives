Go for the GF3.  It's miles past the performance of the GF 2MX, and well 
past the performance of the GF2Ti for not much more money.  As a 
precautionary note, even if you see a GF4 MX out for around the same price, 
go for the GF3 Ti200.  The GF4 MX, despite its name, is a worse-performing 
card in any way you're going to care about.
