Of course not. Ac is number one as a tank, then ac with hp, then ac
with some stats you might want. Its always AC though.

No.

No.
Poison res is really only worth having for specific dragons like Trak
which have a poison attack. You won't be fighting such things until
level 50 plus and no doubt will have better poison res gear by then or
could get the odd item like the split paw necklace at that time if you
needed to.

Chr is only for selling to vendors for a paladin, or buying from
vendors. Therefore you might want to make up a charisma kit to carry
in a bag and put on that necklace then along with the kit.
