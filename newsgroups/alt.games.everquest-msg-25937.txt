Could I get in trouble for going AFK and raising my swimming skills? Let's say
I go to Firiona Vie, swim out to the zone wall, position myself
like..umm...this:
___
  \
(the \ is me, the ___ is the zone wall) "look up"t to keep my head out of the
water, then turn on autorun and go AFK... I tried it while I monitored (I read
a book and kept an eye on the screen) for about 30 minutes--it worked, I got 21
swimming increases, and I didn't come at all close to drowning...it would take
a LONG time to get to the end of the FV zone--it's 20,000+ /loc coords from the
beginning to the end. So, I know it works, but the question is, would I get in
trouble for using it? Thanks.
