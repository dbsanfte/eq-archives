}Heh, didn't need the link.  On a magician the reference is obvious.
}And I was being facetious about the Jay and Silent Bob reference.
}There's the matter of "easily recognized" in there.  I only know of
}3 people who have caught where my mage's name came from.  

Heh, add google.com to the list of people catching it, it turned up 1,910 
hits. :)

}> And your beastie?  Isn't Bosra a city in Syria?  And I go down for my

}Is it?  Bosra just had a nice ring to it, like my BL on another account,
}Crystof.  When I moved to Lanys to hang with my buddy who was new to EQ
}I generated all 8 character slots in a brief time.  I was a bit surprised

Aye, my point was that being a reference to something wasn't enough, it 
had to be an obvious, intended reference to something of questionable 
merit.

}I'm reminded of a high school english teacher I had who's husband's name
}was "Randall".  In America, almost everyone called him "Randy".  When she
}did an exchange year in Scotland, however, she quickly discovered that 
}calling your husband "Randy" was not for polite company.  Her counterpart,
}a very pretty, very young Scots lady from the Orknees (sp?) was likewise
}very embarrassed by the differences in the meaning of a word - Her first
}day she came across one of her students putting lines through mistakes
}instead of erasing them and ask him "What's the matter then, have you
}forgot your rubber?"  15 year old sophmore turns bright read.  She repeats
}herself in a voice loud enough for the whole class to hear "I said, did
}you need a rubber?"  I think she asked several times, with the student
}too utterly mortified to speak before someone had the heart to tell her
}that a rubber was a condom im America.  In Scotland it's an eraser (as you 
}might have guessed from context).  She was so utterly mortified that
}she was almost unable to teach English Comp the next period when we came
}in (and got the full story from the people leaving.) Who was it that said 
}of England and America that (paraphrasing) "the biggest barrier between the 
}two countries is a common language" ?

Aye, and Brits coming to America also often make the mistake of heading 
out to knock up a friend. :)
