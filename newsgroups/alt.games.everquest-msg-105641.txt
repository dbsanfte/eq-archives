Heh, if that scares you, think about the fact that I'm dyslexic, and I
supervise the operations of the mechanical portions of a nuclear power
plant.

It's all a matter of attention to detail.  We dyslexics just need more of it

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
