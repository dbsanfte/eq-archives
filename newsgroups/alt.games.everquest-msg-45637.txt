I wonder if its possible for a single druid to get into fear somewhere
invisible, and have enough space to single pull and root kite a mob
somewhere. Im sure I could kill most of those mobs, given space to do it. Id
guess judging by how hard they hit, that they have somewhere around 10k hit
points. I can solo alwezaur (sp) in oot, so surely I could do this, at least
as far as mana/damage is concerned.

Am I completely nuts? Is there a "safe spot" you could single pull to?
Anyone tried this?
