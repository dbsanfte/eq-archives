    And not many of them that bright, either. Folks, I know you're clearing
out your bank accounts and just want to sell, but you should at LEAST check
the vendor price on your stuff before you set a price. One person in my
guild that I told about this made a fortune buying up Kunark armour (sells
for 333 pp to a vendor) and vendoring it, and buying up JC items (got an
Electrum Black Sapphire earring for 25 pp that vendors for 190 pp) for sale
to a vendor. Easy money.

    Oh, Quindell - were you there when Rel In Por tried to "claim" a corner
of The Bazaar as a guild-only sales area? Priceless!
