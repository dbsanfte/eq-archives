Okay, the Bazaar radically changes the game, but then (/sigh) do a few
other things.

Yes, I'm a first chr person (8 weeks, lvl 32 bard + smatterings
elsewhere). Yes, I do not have any expansion packs. So no, I had no idea
of the bazzar.

For levels 1-15, 10pp was like RICH!. Then some dude wanders around /auc
some sword or something and wants 100/200/300/400pp. Like ROTFLMAO. "I
can get more than that at the bazzar" is the reply. Then bloody go to
the bazaar.

I've since realised that if you have the Luclin expansion and a good
permanent connection, then a newbie would be silly to sell anything to
the merchant, but is better to see everything in the bazzar. Which as
you said means that newbie chr's are Kpp very early and it just all
becomes a matter capitalism. So the whole nature of the game changes to
just one of money, money, money[1]. which explains why I am often
finding lots of unlooted corpses around (twinked rich chr being power
levelled).

I guess it all comes down to why you play the game.


[1] Roll on mass deflation. I've noticed that the buying /auc prize of
morning dew has dropped from 20pp each to 10pp each over the last 8
weeks on the Morrell -Thule server.
