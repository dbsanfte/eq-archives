There are some camps like that, where you have to stay there for an extended
period of time to get item X.  The Shissar camp in Fear for my epic is the
only one I've had to do, but that was because we had to keep the plane
clear.  We were hoping that the thing would spawn in a few hours, but it
wound up spawning at 10am the next morning.  This remains the only time I've
called in "sick" because of EQ and with any luck will be the last.

Most of the multi-day camps you hear about are really just killing
placeholders and waiting for the mob to spawn.  When camping for my VP key,
there were a couple like that.  I think I spent 30 hours or so camping the
pained soul, but I didn't do it all at once.  I'd just sit there for an hour
or two and kill whatever popped.  When I got bored, I'd leave.  Eventually,
he popped.

This is one of those places where what the designers were thinking wasn't
very well aligned with the way people play.  I get the feeling that we were
supposed to run across the PH while doing dungeon crawls and stuff, kill it,
and move on.  Eventually, when crawling, you'd find the thing you were
looking for instead of the PH.  The only flaw in this is that the PH has to
be killed before the rare will spawn.  If the PH/rare/whatever would despawn
and respawn automatically, then there would be a more reasonable chance of
randomly encountering the rare during your normal playtime behavior.

Also, people tend to optimize their behavior to get things done in the minimum
amount of time.  You could randomly drop by the spawn point for a month or
two, and maybe get lucky and find the thing up, or you could grit your
teeth and endure a boring camp for a day and just get it over with.  It's no
surprise that most people choose to just get it over with.

A lot of it's also due to the crowding.  As more people get to the
high-level endgame, there is more demand for certain items, and more people
willing to do the camp for it.  So there's pressure on everyone to grab the
camp, because if they don't, someone else will and they'll never get it. 
When I was camping Verina Tomb for my epic, I just created a DE mule and
kept him camped at her spawn point.  Every day, I'd check it, and finally
she was up when I checked.  But now there are multiple people sitting on her
spawn point, so that approach won't work anymore.
