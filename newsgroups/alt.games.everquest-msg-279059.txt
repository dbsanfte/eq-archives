It occurs to me that the dungeons are essentially deserted whereas TS might have several instances at a time, yet the 
common complaint is "you can't get a group any more". The dungeons are full of ++ and group mobs, and you can't easily 
run if it goes badly, so you would think people would group there. No.

Why don't groups travel to the dungeons? Is it because it is so easy to get to the TS by griffon? Because there are no 
maps (for no reason that has ever been explained by SOE)? Because they are too tough? Or the rewards are insufficient?

The crypt of decay has the same level range as TS but is vacant. Why? One reason i found was that when I died i was 
shoved out of the zone and the entrance that presented itself was the harder one (not good to zone into a fight with a 
group of white mobs when you are trying to retrieve your shard!) It was then clumsy to find the other entrance. I would 
have thought I'd revive within a safe area in CoD.

Can anyone think of any other reasons why the dungeons are so neglected, especially by the groups that claim there are 
no places designed for them?
