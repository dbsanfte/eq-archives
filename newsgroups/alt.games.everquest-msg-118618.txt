Near as I can tell, the cleric's guild in Felwithe doesn't have a name, beyond
"cleric's guild".  And you are right, I wouldn't really want to use the CoMD's name
in this manner.  Still, that doesn't mean I can't reach into my inherent High-Elf
snootiness as you suggest.  I suspect I am putting too much thought into this.  It
seems to me that people who try to treat others as heal/buff whores aren't that much
into role-playing anyways.  I think I might still stick with a curt "No."  But thank
you for giving me a reason to internally justify doing so.

Oh, not to worry.  I don't worry about stalkers like some of the other posters on
this group seem prone to.  Buff away!  Heck, send me a tell and introduce yourself,
I'm approachable.  Norrath can be a big scary place, and the more friends we make,
the better!  Besides, we're the right level to group together, and a druid, cleric
and warrior would make a nice combo, I'd wager.
