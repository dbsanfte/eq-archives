Sorry to hear about GoD hitting your guild hard. Our guild has managed
to dig our way out of the large of burnout of many members by absorbing
some good people from two other guilds that self destructed on our
server and are just a bit ahead of you it sounds like. We're 1 for 3 on
Barxt and close to a second kill next time our timer resets. While most
of Uqua is pretty annoying, the Barxt fight is fairly interesting, hope
you enjoy it.
