Yeah, and? This tells me that SOE clearly didn't intend for people to
go scum the Bazaar for items to donate. If you want to spend the time
setting up a bazaar mule to sell an item that is, more often than not,
a hard sell rather than turn it in to the TM for a lesser point
reward, go ahead. Many of the items people bought specifically for the
TM were items that didn't move fast at all otherwise.
