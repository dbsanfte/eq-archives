98% of people I grouped with offered nothing to cover expenses. Tanks seem
to be constantly coming and going, and I go through peridots even faster.
Its a pain in the ass having to constantly ask for money to cover you. Some
people want to argue about it. I enjoyed playing my cleric to 51, but after
that it was terrible. I could afford it by paying for it with my alt, but
its still annoying. The game would be better without these irritations.
