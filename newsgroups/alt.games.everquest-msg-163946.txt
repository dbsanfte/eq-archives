Ahh, but I do.  Sometimes I answer questions.  Sometimes I engage in
game-mechanics and tacics discussions.  Sometimes I make (to me) witty
comments that aren't complaining about complainers or related to the rules
of the game.

Care to point to any examples of you doing likewise?

And yeah, my responses to *you* are predictable, because it's basically the
same response every time.  What can I say, I'm lazy.  I'm not gonna make up
twenty different responses to your single train of thought.
