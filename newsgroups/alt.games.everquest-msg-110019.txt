Steel boning is used in tinkering to make metallic fish.   :P... just kidding.
It's used by tailors to make reinforced leather armor.

If you're not an enchanter, don't bother with jewelry crafting.  Enchanters
are the only class that can enchant the metal bars needed to craft magical
jewelry.  If you learn this skill not as an enchanter, you'll be dependent upon
enchanter friends (or guild members) to enchant metal for you.  This is a boring
task for an enchanter and can require a lot of mana, so you may have a hard time
talking them into it.
