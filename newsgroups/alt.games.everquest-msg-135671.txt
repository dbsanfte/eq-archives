Here's the part that worries me:
----
Under the bill, companies would not be required to warn users in advance of
their actions. A user wrongly attacked could sue only if he suffered more
than $250 in economic losses and obtained permission to file a lawsuit from
the U.S. attorney general.
----

So I'd need permission from the government to sue someone who attacked me.
Why does that just sit wrong with me?

Ah well, three cheers to the first person who scores a successful
counter-attack.
