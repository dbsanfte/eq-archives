    If a guild wanted to, they could always schedule a "guild travel day",
where everyone knew they'd be doing SOMETHING, but not what. Then log in the
alts and trackmules, find out what's up, and go do that. If nothing specific
is up, have a "Plan B" zone that has activity that can ALWAYS be done -
Dragon Necropolis, say, or Siren's Grotto. Keep watching the trackmules just
in case, though. This way, people know in advance to not go get a group
somewhere or get involved in some quest without having to be at the beck and
call of the guild. Will you flat out be unable to get some highly contested
spawns this way? Yup, if you want them you really have to camp them. But
then you get into "do we HAVE to be as big a guild as we can be?"

    One of the big keys to quick response is to start hunting in guild
groups, porter in every group. As long as people are scattered all over the
place you just won't get the sort of response time you want.
