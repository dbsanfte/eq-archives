my cleric finally made it to 49, and I figured I'd move from DL to velks,
but now ive got there and I see all these lvl 58-60 chars, im wondering if
49 might be considered too low. I figure CH is enough to make me useful, but
is just having the 90% rez going to count against me badly?

Are people /ooc'ing for rez's there, implicitly asking for 95% rez's?

Would sebilis be better for me? having quadded with a druid mainly, I dont
have a lot of knowledge of either. I tend to play during the graveyard
shift, if that has any bearing. Karnors castle isnt an option, as I dont
want to tick of my ol pal Venril.
