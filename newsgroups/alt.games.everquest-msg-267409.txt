Have to argue on that one. Currently I'm a level 14 druid, but at level 10 I 
was most certainly soloing in Antonica. You have to very picky about which 
mobs you take, but at that level I was able to solo whites with 1 or two up 
arrows on them. The ability to heal yourself while blasting (which btw the 
heroic oppurtities are wonderful for soloing) definatly make up for the lack 
of melee power. IMO
