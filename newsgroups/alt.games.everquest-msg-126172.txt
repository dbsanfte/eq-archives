In the interest of saving my fellow theologians a little legwork, here's 
the verses under discussion:

5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.

}Well according to those verses, his position on eating rabbit or frog legs 
}is also inferred, rather than explicitly detailed, and yet Christians don't 
}have a problem with either.

Aye, and what about the bit about making cheeseburgers?

Exodus 34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring 
unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

Even an adult cow is someone's kid.  No cooking beef and dairy together. 
Naughty naughty.
