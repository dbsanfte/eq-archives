Probably one of the biggest most awsome trains I have seen was in 
Crystal Caverns.

I joined group close to the entrance, which had 2 bards, one bard
was going to sing his invis song, jump down the pit and head to the
dwarven town. I was in the kind of mood where I felt like trusting
my invis more than his invis song, (actually was prompted by the
cleric who insisted I invis and lev her).

We got to the edge of the pit just about the time the other four
members of the party were reacing the bottome of the pit, and as I
looked down I could see the orcs were starting to move in a most
aggitated manner.

We hit the bottom, rejoined the party in the hallway just outside
the pit on the way to the dwarven town and were doing a quick head
check to make sure we all had made it, when the train rounded the
corner.

I think the train included every orc in the place, and the second
bard went from full to zero health as we turned and ran. The 
first bard and our wiz fell on the way, and the cleric, ranger,
and myself (enchanter), all made it into the town with a fraction
of health as the train slammed into the guards and a mad fight
ensued at the front gate.

Those of us that lived could hardly beleive it, and were saying 
as much in gsay, when the train overwelmed the gate guards, and
broke into the town. The ranger went down as the train raged thru
the town with orcs and dwarven merchants in pitched battles.

The cleric found a cubby and gated, but I did not have gate memmed
and an orc was beating on me. I found a cubby with a merchant and
the orc turned his attention to the merchant, I sat, memmed gate,
and got out of Dodge.
