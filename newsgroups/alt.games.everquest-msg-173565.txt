People treat this like its the only thing a bard brings to the
table on a raid sometimes.

I just leveled up to where I got it, and I'm trying to think why
its such a biggie.

Says here it decreases cold, fire, and magic resists by 10.

Its percussion, this means that with a good drum ( I have a
walrus skin, need to get better eventually I know, but thats
what, 3rd best?) it will drop them further still.. but is 20
points resist reduction really all that and a bag of chips?

It is nice that its three resists instead of the one resist I'm
used to dropping... I've been doing Fufil's to allow Malosini to
stick, for example, or to let chanter stick slows without needing
to tash.

Its very nice that its no damage; tying resist reduction to DOT
means I can't help in initial debuffing.

Of course no mana cost involved is nice, very few bard songs need
mana and I dread finding another, since I get mana back so
abyssimally slowly...

Does it stick easily like tash, or always, like Malo?  Or is this
another "this will make it easier to stick stuff... if I can get
it to stick" catch 22 spell line?

So tell me, does it really help all that much?  Where, why, and
should I make a hotkey announcing when its stuck?  Do I keep it
running full time to help land nukes and so forth during a fight,
or is it just to help prep the mezzed target before we go in?

Throw me a bone, people (all I asked for was a fricking rotating
chair)
