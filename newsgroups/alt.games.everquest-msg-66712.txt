Nope, didn't know any monks in <Stone Guard> (actually, haven't known anyone
from SG...hehe...)

On EMarr, I'm best known as Sheldomar Bolak, priest of Life from Qeynos, and
formerly a <Healers of Harmony>  guild officer, back before it became a dead
guild.  Sheldomar's "younger brother" (my alt) is Arthomar Bolak, Paladin of
Karana.

I understand there is also a Sheldomar on the Nameless, but that's not me.

I've spent much of my time in the game 'smelling the roses' rather than
powerleveling myself, so neither one of my mains are too terribly high of a
level.

I have other characters on Saryn, Tallon Zek, and Sullon Zek.  But my
favorite server has always been EMarr.....
