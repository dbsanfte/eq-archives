Had a problem with a necro once. I had my lvl 49 earth pet up, which has a
root that sticks most of the time. He was almost chain casting fear totally
forgetting my pet was rooting :-/

I finally figured out what he was trying to do (had particles turned off
because of a raid a few days before that) and pointed it out. He stopped
fearing and instead dotted the mobs which had us mowing the mobs down in
half the time normally used :)

Fear kiting is nice, but with any group more then 3 persons it's usually a
waste of time. Especially when you have a shammy or enchanter with slow
around.
