You won't kill every single mob with your PB AE's.  Sometimes you may be
left with just 1 (like a named) othertimes its 2-3, in which case PB's are
not effective enough to use.  Mobs all have different HP's, will resist
differently etc.

Like I said it depends.  If you want to limit yourself to 25mob sebilis
pulls then stick with 2 enchanters.

If you have 1 enchanter..  well your dieing a pointless death (good luck
c.ring as a bunch of naked casters)

Remember, ONE partially resisted stun with a single chanter, and your ALL
dead. Whether you have full mana or not, NOTHING is saving a chanter alive
with a bundle of ae mobs hitting it

If you want real AE action (55mob first pull, the "warmup" pull.. I will
post a log of this when I remember) then you want 3 chanters.

2 clerics and a druid your suggesting?  Bear this in mind, whether you pull
5, 15 or 50.. your going to use the *same* mana to kill them.  AE groups
aren't easy, and you wont get anywhere just throwing together any random
characters

Too weak.  Even at 60, druids just don't cut it as real AE damage dealers.
I've never seen a single wizard AE group, and Im sure there was a big reason
for that.

Don't fool yourself into thinking as a cleric your PB Ae's are crucial, or
that an additional cleric can in some way replace a wizard or magician or
nuking purposes.

I've pulled for my AE groups as my monk (in sebilis), my wizard (sebilis and
acrylia), and a guild warrior in seb (he was botting the chanter and we
really needed a second one to get going)

In a zone like HS, I've seen paladins make effective AE pullers (remember
your going to eat a lot of HT's)
