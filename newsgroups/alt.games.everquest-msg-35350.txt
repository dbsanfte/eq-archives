No, once you are on the hate list, there is no way off it except for zoning,
dying, or killing the things that have noticed you.

Using the hide button in combat for Rogues is called "Evade"  (you will have
to turn your attack off for a moment to do it)  Using evade during combat will
lower you on the hate list (so hopefully whatever you are fighting will turn
to face somoene else, and you can backstab again)  But Evade will never remove
a rogue completely from the hate list.
