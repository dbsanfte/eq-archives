    Having said that, why did dying in your story below piss you off so
much? Don't you find that just a little contradictory?

    There's more to it than the raw maths.

    I don't want to get into an argument with you over the particulars as I
think we're in basic agreement to the point where we could group for a
lifetime and never find fault with one another, so I'll leave that alone.
I've never had a rez refused, but then I've never ignored a LoM warning from
the primary healer, although I tend to take LoM to mean "low on mana, can
still heal but not much, don't pull anything nasty" and OOM to mean "out of
mana, cannot heal at all do NOT pull". Another one I tend to react
immediately to is "hold pulls".

    Some exceptions are when I reply with "Will fear kite, memming fear one
moment", which allows to the group to continue to shovel in exp, depending
where we are of course (some places just don't react well with fear kiting)
but most tanks and casters alike hate fear kiting because they have to work
harder. Tanks have to follow the mob actively and casters have to make sure
they're in range of the mob or anyone they're healing/buffing. Adds are also
more common, but being that nobody gets hit by the primary mob in most
places where people bother to do it for a group it's actually not that much
more dangerous.

James
