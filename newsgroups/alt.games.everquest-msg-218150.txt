No. I wouldn't. Because even if that's what sent him over the edge it 
was obviously not an incitement to do so by me, framed as it was in TiC.

Having said that, where would I 'assign blame'? I wouldn't; I couldn't. 
I'm sure his parents had a hand in it, but so did his peers, job/lack 
thereof, significant other/lack thereof, perhaps he fell through some 
societal cracks, hell, perhaps he had a corpse rot in EQ and lost all 
his stuff and was treated with the delightful impotence that the EQ 
customer service is famous for and that was a factor too...all that plus 
my TiC statement... and someone wants to lay the blame at my feet? 
Forget it.

Pointing at me is bullshit, pointing at SoE is bullshit, pointing at his 
parents failure to bring him up right bullshit unless their is actual 
evidence that they did something extraordinary to merit it, and pointing 
at his parents genetic code is especially bullshit.

Society collectively failed him, or maybe he failed at society... I'm 
sure he has his flaws... and I know for a fact that society does. If his 
death causes a piece of society to re-examine and reflect upon itself, 
to see if the death could have been averted, and adjusts itself 
accordingly great... but if the whole point of the reflection is to 
establish 'who's to blame' so that the rest of us can sleep easier at 
night... then its just wasted effort.... because odds are its no one 
persons fault.
