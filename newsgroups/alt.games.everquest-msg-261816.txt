Well, Ornate is also "attunable" in this way; you can sell the patterns, 
but when you actually do the remaining steps you create a no drop piece.

Thats an improvement over the Velious armor model, where you have to MQ 
the piece (and have to trust the person to actually do the MQ correctly.

And that was an improvement over the true No Drop model, where things 
dropped and if you couldn't use them they rotted or perhaps got picked 
up by people who happen to be in the same zone.

Improvement being, of course, a loaded term, in that I only mean it 
makes the "No Drop on someone who didn't kill the mob" easier.
