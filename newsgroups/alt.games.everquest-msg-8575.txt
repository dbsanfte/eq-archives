There is only one teleport destination in the whole of Kunark;
Dreadlands. It can be as nasty as the name suggests to traverse
through, too. Many of the mobs can see straight through invis... and
at level 51 I am still a little wary of travelling through the zone.
This was where I saw my first dragon; Gorenaire. tip: do NOT accept
any offers of wolf-form on arrival at the druid/wizard rings ;)

From Dreadlands, you can go Frontier Mountains which links to Lake of
Ill Omen (next to the Sarnak Fortress).
