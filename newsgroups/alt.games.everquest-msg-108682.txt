Heh, that's why you wait until 3 am when there's only 24 people in zone
farming somewhere in deep west or east.

Were they actually in the hub or did you open the wrong door though?  for
the north door everything past Arraken Skyward is KoS, and everything past
the east door is KoS, the west wing is safe since you're on CoV, as long as
you don't get clipped by an AoE anyways.
