At level 65... admittedly they'll be 65 for longer than they were
1-64 probably, but its still not a good general rule to say that
beastlords have a slow "only" 10% lower than that of shaman.  For
the most part their slow is significantly worse, although it
doesn't suck quite as bad as bard slow.

Necros are great for

Yep, if there were more undead, necros/cleric/paladin groups
would rule the world.  Slow that only works on a rare type of mob
isn't a good deal for a generic job breakdown, though.

This is what I was talking about, I too said "its only 5% less
slow" but if you do the math, it means the tank takes something
like 20% more damage over the run of the fight, the beastlord
slow is even worse, the tank takes something like 40% more
damage.

I also mentioned this in my parenthetical, where I say "(over
most of their career)"
