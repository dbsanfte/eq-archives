Even GMs dont give a sh.. if you lose items/plat. After a servercrash I had
lost a gem-inlaid-longsword (btw most people on luclin lost items/ complete
equip too this time)... they wanted me to prove where/when I have got this
item with log and people that have been with me ... would be interesting to
prove it if you have lost a few thousand pps..... They will tell you they
have no access to logs of your char and you ll have to live with the
situation ... I for my part never will rely on a GM/guide anymore, even less
have trust in the programmers (every human can make mistakes).

Have fun in game and lets hope our items will survive ;-)
