We were allowed to write those down?  *sigh*

I'm saying that if YOU have a char, and you start another character, that
other character is it's own person.. it makes no sense for that person to
have items given to him/her from a complete stranger (your main).  I think
that they need to either allow full item swapping between mains and alts, or
people need to start thinking of "would my DE really give this cute little
Gnome a staff of reckoning +1000?
