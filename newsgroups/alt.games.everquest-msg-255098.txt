Well, I admit my druid may have gotten some odd ideas due to her
upbringing: her "big brother" is a monk. :-)  (He's Iksar, she's
Halfling, so presumably one of them was adopted.)

But even so, I do find it useful, particularly when soloing but
sometimes even in groups.  Basically any time my mana is low
enough that I was to med, and either I or someone else needs
healing, I can sit down and bind wounds and thus get both hp and
mana rather than spending mana for hp.

Once I get to the levels where the hp regen spells turn up (level
34, I think), I may change my mind.  But in the meantime, it's
easy enough to keep a couple stacks of bandages on hand.
