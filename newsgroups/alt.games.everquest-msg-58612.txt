You really should raise your 1HS.  The epic weapon is slashing, and slash tends
to be the best anyway.  I know it's really annoying (I started over 3 TIMES
with all 3 weapon skills, but now I can wield anything).  However, you will
appreciate it once your skill is higher.  Just get a 1HS weapon, and keep your
blunt with you (just in case you're in trouble).

In terms of a weapon, a great choice at your level would be the icepaw war
claw.  It doesn't have any wisdom or mana, but it is 9 dmg and 24 delay, which
is pretty good for its price (about 500pp, but many many people get them for
much better prices.  I got mine for 150.  A lot of people got them for as low
as 20).  Plus, this is the only set of claws that druids can wield, so you look
REALLY nice!  Good luck finding something that works well for you!
