I think I finally figured it out.  I had to go into BIOS and set my AGP
Aperature size from 256 (which it has always been on) to 64mb.  I only have
those choices, and I don't know why it's like that but it is.  I have 512mb
system memory.  Is that too much for Windows ME to handle? Because With
Win2k or XP I can play the game with 256mb AGP Aperature.

Maybe this will work.
