Dammit! don't tell newbies to do that! I met a level 40 monk with like 200k
in gear who didn't know where greater faydark was!

Money will come, young necro. Keep levelling up, do some good quests, and
farm spider silks and animal furs as mentioned above so you can afford your
spells.  Necro is one of the best, if not THE best class for farming plat in
the higher levels.  You just take a day once in awhile and camp something.

Once you've got a bit, the trader game is awesome... buy low, sell high...
gradually buy bigger and bigger things.  As a 65 necro, I can farm named in
veksar for good drops to sell (eg. soulscream belt, 20kpp), solo the king
room in sebilis for a fungus covered scale tunic (60kpp), and ravage the
cazic-thule sewers for a pair of boots of flowing slime (100kpp) with ease.
(just takes a little time and patience!)
