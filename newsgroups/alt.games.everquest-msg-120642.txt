 Depends on the mob. Again, the case of the Newly Created Sentries in
Sleepers Tomb. They hit for 300 if I remember correctly and have way
more HPs than a summoned pet. Granted, this is probably an exception but
it exists. An Enchanter wont zone into ST and dire charm a golem and
start soloing so the XP split isn't even a consideration.

 I've also yet to see a summoned pet that was level 60.
