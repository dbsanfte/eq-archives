Far more important than you processor is the amount of memory you have, and
the video card you are using.  I would recommend an absolute minimum of
512mb of memory, more is better.  You should probably go with one of the
GeForce cards, which one, depends on your budget, but GeForce3 would be
better.  I have 768MB, and a GeForce2 MX400, Luclin zones are not very good,
I have to crank down the graphics settings a lot for them.  It runs great in
most other zones, I run at 1280x1024.  I have a PIII-800.
