A quick addendum to his post for pet classes - get Calliav
and be ready to heal your pet.  Aged stonemites AOE rampage
and chew pets up.  The ancient doesn't rampage, however.

Had a different tank in our attempt yesterday (our regular
tank is already flagged and wasn't on) and boy did we have
problems with aggro.  He seemed utterly unable to keep the
suckers from rushing the cleric.  It's odd because I was able
to slow within the first couple percent w/o aggro.  The
day before with a different tank, same cleric but a husband
and wife enchanter/mage duo instead of my BL/mage (I got
home too late, just in time to listen in on teamspeak as they
finished) the tank had no aggro problems.
