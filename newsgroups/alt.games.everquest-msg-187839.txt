This would be my advice, thereabouts, as well. You don't get much bang
for your buck when you pour money into a casting class to twink it.
All your equipment is insignificant to whether or not you have a KEI
up, really.

Get your wis to 200 (or 250 if you just want to be complete), make
sure you've got one or two clicky items for L45 (es arms say), and
hold onto the rest of the money.

Now if you were a melee, then you could have fun with 21kpp for
twinking....
