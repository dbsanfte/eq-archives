North Karana has beetles you can kill I think. They don't give any good loot
though. Just like the crocs and caiman in Oasis. So If you don't mind bad
loot. Oasis is also a good place to hunt. Also you can get into orc group in
oasis. They drop raw hide armor. You can also try Unrest. Everfrost is
closer to your place right now. You can get a mamoth calf group there I
think.
