I find this one very useful, as I tend to spend a lot of time not 
exping, and occaisionally get in a good group that finds a good 
situation and pulls in really good exp... pop this discipline and I can 
double my exp for the day... because although I might have been online 
for a couple hours, often only a short amount of that time is really 
earning significant exp.

The trick is not to use it to double some exp  thats coming in slowly, 
if possible use it when you're fully buffed and have a pull pattern 
going and so on where you're going to be getting the best exp of the day

Of course where people get killed, as Impmon suggests, is where they go 
out of their way to pull harder and faster than ever, trying to maximize 
exp during that relatively brief period of doubled exp.  A natural 
response, but not a good one, as spending part of your precious doubled 
exp time getting rezzed and rebuffed and rebreaking a spawn isn't 
productive (hmm, does death clear that double exp buff from you?  I 
think it does, come to think of it, which is even worse!)
