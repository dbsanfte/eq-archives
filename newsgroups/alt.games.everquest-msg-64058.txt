I used EQW to get in... I didnt get in all the way cause EQW stopped working
at the character select screen... but I can tell you that barb's look fat
now! I lost mouse control there too, sooo didnt get to look around much. I
took a screenshot of the screen but it didnt come up right on clipboard.
but, as usual, there is a new loading screen, but also there is a bar at the
bottom of the screen, it fills up with blue to let you know the loading
process, AND it also tells you what exactly its loading... pretty neat. Oh
well, I guess I'll see the rest of the game tomorrow....
