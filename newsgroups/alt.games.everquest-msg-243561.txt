Also you don't hand anything to the Tribute Master.  Right click on her like
you would a merchant.  A screen will come up listing all the effects with a
spot for donating platinum.  Open your inventory and click on items as you
would to sell them to a vendor and you will get a message listing how much
tribute you will get for the item.
