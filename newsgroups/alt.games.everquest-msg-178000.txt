There are only three options at this point, either you will repent now and
spend a relatively easy time waiting for the rapture(kind of like waiting
for christmas morning when you are a kid, takes forever), or you will fail
to see your lack of wisdom and spend another equally long period with the
devil in full control of the earth and God will punish everyone on the
planet without mercy. You can still change your mind during this last chance
period of time and choose to worship God although you will likely be killed
for it. Then you will either be killed or will live through the period
without dying, then at the end we all get to be judged not necessarily for
whether we were good, but if we lived our lives for God instead of
ourselves, personally I lived the first part of my life for God, then I was
foolish and rejected him, then I realized I was going to rightfully end up
in Hell if I continued down the path I was going, so I would hope that most
people won't end up in Hell, and I get the feeling that most people won't,
but some people will refuse to turn away from their own self-exhaltation.
God showed me what my Hell was going to look like, and it was basically my
room with the lights dimmed and garbage all over the floor but with the door
and windows sealed shut so I could never get out and no one could ever get
in, forever.

That terrified me to death, and now whenever I think of being alone like
that it makes me very scared. I'm glad there is still plenty of time left to
try to get my life into better shape, so I don't end up in Hell.

Incidentally, I was saved in the end because I became a Christian when I was
much younger, God saved me, just like he said he would to anyone who asks
for salvation, you literally just ask to be forgiven, ask to be saved, ask
for Jesus to enter your life, and then you try to live your life according
to the Bible and life your life for God, it's really very easy. Very hard to
do if you are not young or old though.
