Okay, so at 60, with a shaman in the group slowing the mobs and
hasting two monks (and only with single pulls, of course), the cleric
doesn't have to med.

Well, duh.  The cleric's not needed except for the HP/AC buffs, if
even those.   Now get rid of the shaman and see how much the
cleric needs to med...

It's obvious that if the cleric isn't needed, he's not going to have
to med.  Hell, I've been in ToV and not needed to med (fun with
caster groups.)   Even fought Dain and first brood dragons without
sitting down.

Still, any cleric that doesn't expect to med 95% of their time
gaining XP (or raiding) is either fooling themselves or not needed.
