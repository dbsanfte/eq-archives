Everyone answered the What is question and I'll just let you know that I
have some screenshots of the Druid Epic, The Chanter Epic, The Shaman Epic,
and maybe a different one as well...  They are (in my experience) difficult
to find good pictures of on the web.  The Druid Epic is (also in my
experience) the neatest Epic I've seen up close...  It's animation consists
of little green leaves that swirl around the blade.

The Shadow Knight Epic has little skulls that circle it and The Bard's
actually has little music notes that float around it.

The Epics are all very cool, and if you are on the lookout, you'll see em
eventually.  Even High Levels have to bank...  hehe..
