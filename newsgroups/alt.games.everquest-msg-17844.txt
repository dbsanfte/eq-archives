I am finally at the point (level 42 Paladin) when I need to and can
afford some serious 500 - 1500pp items for purchase.  
What I find is I have to make choices between greater Hit Points,
gaining or losing 3 or 4 AC points,  +points to Str or Stamina.  In
the case of being a Paladin extra wisdom and mana points.

One piece of jewlry, lets say, offers +65 to HP and +65 to mana
is that better than one that offers  +6 STR and +6 WIS.


   I know this is a hard question to answer and there are trade offs
I just want some general ballpark answers./opinions.


For example is it worth giving up 3 AC to gain 3 STR
Is it worth giving up 3ac and gaining 30 HP
Is it worth giving up 3str to get 30 hp.


I know having a good damaging weapon like Mitheral 2 hander or the
Blade of Xalgoz (I use) helps survivability, the quicker the monster
dies the less you get hit. [ I have determined that when tanking the
shield, 1hs config is inferior, except when fighting casters or in the
case of Ghoulbane the undead]


What I have a hard time figuring out is how do STR, STA, AC and HP
play out.





 as a side note, It would also help to know how mana and Wis relate

would trading a +6 Wis item for a + 60 mana item make sence.

Thanks in advance
