The book is a wimp, and will never get anywhere trying to solo a warrior.

Guards rarely help, and if they do, well lets be honest, you're such a 
newbie that dying is really just a faster way to get back to full HP and 
full mana.  No exp lost, no having to go find your gear.

If you're high enough level for those worries, then its a rare guard 
indeed who will help you out, maybe in GD you may find the coldain to be 
of some assistance... but waiting for them to make a kill isn't really 
all that good a plan either.

If you want to run, it should be to a zone line.  A zone line is like 
reaching a Safe area when playing tag.

But if you want to solo a warrior in a way other than tedious, you don't 
run at 50%, you fight all the way down.

The reason to run isn't your hp total, its a difference in the rate that 
your hp and that of the mob is dropping; if the mob goes from 100% to 
80% while you go from 100% to 81%, then you stay and fight, because 
eventually you will get the mob to 0%, and you'll have 5% of your HP bar 
left.  But if the mob goes from 100% to 80% while you go from 100% to 
79%, then you run, because if you stay you're just going to waste a lot 
of time and end up dead while the mob is still at 5%.

Thats oversimplified, because if you know you have a proccing weapon 
thats likely to proc a slow or a heal of some kind or -something- thats 
going to make up that 5% difference, you can stick around a while and 
gamble that it will go off and tip the odds.  And of course there's 
spikes to worry about, 5% difference is really in the "too close to 
call" range in some cases.

But a sensible warrior isn't fighting a mob that will take 95% of his HP 
to kill, he's going after 4 that each take 20%, and if he's got the 
edge, one more, if not, well he heals from 20% (or 15% or 10%, whatever 
he ended that last fight with).  A mob that averages 20% of his hp bar 
isn't likely to spike so large as to make up a 10% lead, while one that 
averages 95% of his bar may well do so.

Dying isn't a good way to make exp (except at the very low end of the 
game, where as I mentioned, its free hp and mana restored, if you aren't 
  trying to hang onto a buff you can't replace)
