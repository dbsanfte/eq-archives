    I wanted to try being a monster, and try PvP (in a limited form) at the
same time. Since all the cries for help were doing is attracting other
player mobs to Neriak, if I wanted to kill anything I had to go there. Given
the players kept on casting on me, I felt it my duty as a monster to beat
them senseless. 8)

    It would on Test, the underpopulated server. There was never other
players in the zone. When I spawned in WC as a giant spider, a /who all
revealed only my level 6 giant spider in the zone. (Yeah, your monster
showed up on /who all. It was neat.) I can't imagine a server where West
Commons is empty at ANY time of day, let alone prime time when I was
playing.

>Killing someone is one thing, you're describing harrassment, however.

    When I first arrived at Neriak, I ended up killing the snake and
decaying skeleton that had been bind-point camping the level 1 cleric. The
rules allowed them to do it, so they did it. That's the motto of PvP. If
someone as generally mild-mannered (I DID try to do some /emote
communications and play with them, until they kept casting ;-) ) as me could
grief with such ease, imagine what dedicated griefers could do.

    To the true griefer, time wasted is irrelevant. They are preventing you
from doing what YOU want to do - that's satisfaction enough.

    Oh, ok. Yeah, good point! 8)
