Oddly, Firiona Vie seems to disprove this theory; by and large pricing 
is the same as it is on "normal" servers, its just that the selection is 
better.

Yes, I understand that is the case.

The problem isn't from the standpoint of the game, its from the 
standpoint of the player; I feel I've invested a lot of time and effort 
to get this no drop gear, and now I'm just throwing it away.

My thought was that tribute would reward me for upgrading in much the 
same way that upgrading droppable gear does; I'd get both the new item 
-and- a reward for getting rid of the old item.  But it would do so 
while destroying the item itself.

It doesn't add value to the droppable items.  If anything it reduces the 
value of them, since you don't need them so much.

This is an excellent point that I hadn't considered.

Yes, but I already knew how normal tribute worked, and assumed guild 
tribute would work the same way, so I didn't feel... robbed? 
Dissapointed? ... to discover that this was the case.

This is a good point, and probably enough, unfortunately, to counteract 
my desire for emotional closure on those old items.

I still fondly recall, though, discovering my cleric could ditch all his 
old Fear/Hate Grape armor in POK for exp and gems; I liked being 
rewarded again for having spent the time and effort to collect that 
stuff which was state of the art at the time, and was now worse than 
what the typical level 20 toon is wearing, untwinked*
