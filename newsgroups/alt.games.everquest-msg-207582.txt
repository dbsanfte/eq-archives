I was in trader mode over night and woke up to find myself logged out.
Logged back and was in the azaar and was one of only 40 people there.  It
was the first time I've *ever* run around at bardspeed in the Bazaar with
all the bells and whistles on and not have even a hint of lag!!!
WOOT!!!!!
Of course that lasted about 5 minutes, but it was nice while it lasted...
