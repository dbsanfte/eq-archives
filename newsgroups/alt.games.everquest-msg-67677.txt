Either card will do well for your gaming to be honest.  Like others
have pointed out, just make sure you get the 64meg flavor.

If I had to choose between the GeForce2 and a Radeon 7200, I'd
probably go with the Radeon card.  Eeks out the GeForce2 by a little
bit.  At least in the benchmarks I've seen.
