The "level * 5" issue is one of the handicaps that Paladins endure
in order to balance out the extra abilities they gain via having
spells (as opposed to, say, a Warrior).

As for skill increases from light blues, they can happen on
any character, but are pretty rare for everyone.  Apparently
you've just been luckier on your other characters than on
your Paladin in this regard.

Plus, there are some fighting skills that can go up even
against green mobs, while others can't -- perhaps your other
characters were getting certain types of skill raises on
light blue mobs, while your Paladin may not have those
particular skills.
