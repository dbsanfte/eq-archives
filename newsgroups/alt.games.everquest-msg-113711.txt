I think it's about time that regeneration rate was made into a percentage of
your total (natural) HP, the whole idea of a  level 19 warrior having to
regen 2 hp at a time when a level one character is capable of the same thing
seems mildly ridiculous to me ( and probably everybody else too).

The other (minor) gripe I have is not getting XP for green cons, You should
get xp for any kill.
If you're a 54 lvl character the amount of xp gained from a rat would be so
small as to be hardly worth running around hunting them, but it is possible
for several green Mobs to kill a character and thus it seems totally out of
balance that you can't get any XP for them.

Just my 2cp )
