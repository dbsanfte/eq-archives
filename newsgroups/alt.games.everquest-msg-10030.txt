 I pretty much agree. I focused on leveling to 60 because I knew at that
point I could really start having more fun.. I can explore and not care
if I die because I'd have to die 5 or so times without a res before I
lost my level. I'm not saying that I didn't have fun leveling up because
I did. Get in good groups, meet people, have fun. But my goal was 60.
All I have to say is 60, for me, is a lot more fun than getting there.
