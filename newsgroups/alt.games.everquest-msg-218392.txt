   You can order him to follow you around?  Cool!  I love having human

Stockholm Syndrome.

   I can see this being a problem.  Yes, they say they tuned them down,
but really, I can't see them being easy now.  But if there is good stuff
inside, I can still see some over-eagers trying to open them in a fit of
greed, thus hurting the party's chances for a win.

    Because these things are pretty enough already with the augs?  Well,
at least we can still aug our cloth armor.

   And I hope for Drogmars also.  I've left Gumdrop in the PoT for days
on end, with no way to tell her to knock off for the night.

   This is going to be odd, I bet.  More proof that the vision has been
put into a chest, then heaved off of the Coronado Bridge.

   About time.

  Heh.  The very, very first character I started was a druid (last
druid, I might add).  I not only not know about spell levels, I also
didn't know that one could even buy new spells period.  I think I got to
about level 7 ish with my two starting spells, before someone clued me
in (with liberal use of laughing, finger pointing, and use of the words
"idiot" and "noob".)

Hook them while they are young.

   I got shown the hotbutton things when I young, but if not, I suppose
it would have taken me a while to stumble on to them.

Better than "poofing".

Oh, that could be nice!

If it works.

   To better quantify the dick waving.

   Boo.  Hiss.  Now I have to type /autojoin serverwide.age:age every
time I start a new character?!  If I hadn't more or less picked a main,
this would be pretty annoying.
