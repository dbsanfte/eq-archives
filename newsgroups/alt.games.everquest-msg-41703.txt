This is where you go wrong.  Bush will not do "the same thing" that
Clinton did.  Clinton tried to hit Bin Laden with meaningless
pin-prick Tomohawk missile strikes because he didn't have the
political BALLS to risk the lives of our pilots and troops.  From
Bush, we will get a sustained attack that will lessen the ability of
our targets to retaliate.  We will also put money and effort into
building up our military and intelligence capabilities.

There's a word for making the enemy mad without taking away his
ability to fight.  At Westpoint, they call it STUPID.  Bush and his
staff have the competence and courage not to make the same mistake.
