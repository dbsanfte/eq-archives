I'm sure just about everyone is familiar with the problem of certain
characters being dropped in ooc's, auctions, etc.  That's why people
still often give locs using "pos" and "neg" instead of "+" and "-".

My enchanter just maxed out jewelry, and I'm surprised to find that
this is still a problem.  Apparently some people see things like:

        WTS +6 wis ring 50pp

as:

        WTS wis ring 50pp

(Not an actual price :-) )

Can anyone provide more information on this problem?  Specifically:

- What is the exact nature of the problem?  What determines which
  characters are dropped and why some people see them while others
  do not?  Is there some way to avoid the problem completely?

- Are the Everquest development folks aware of this problem?  I
  took a quick look on the Developer's Forum but saw no mention
  of it.

- Or has this been done deliberately for some reason I can't fathom?

Thanks!
