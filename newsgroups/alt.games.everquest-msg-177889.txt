"Let's take rcy" a group member said.
"OK" said the rest.
I fire up selos and we head toward rcy.  I get to the end of the hall.
No-one in rcy.  Lcy is empty too.  I turn around and see my group heading
toward me.  When they stop...DOH!!!  Not my group!
"Hey, we're about to lose rcy or lcy or both if you don't hurry up.  Another
group here."  I say.  They'll brt they say.
New group is standing around looking at me (because I'm a bard and bards are
beautiful maybe?) and my group isn't coming.  A member of the "new" group
zips into rcy and runs out.
WHACK!!  I get hit.  Keep in mind at this point, I have not moved and have
been standing still in the middle of the hall between rcy and lcy.
Well, they're clearing the room and I'm interfering, obviously, since they
are whacking the mob silly.  I run back by entrance and explain that we lost
rcy and I got slammed by a mob.  I also explain that one of the members of
the group is a complete asshole.  He's a general PITA that I will never ever
group with again.  Think of a Dwarven Hitler....
"If you got hit, zone and come back" says group leader.  NP, I can do that.

Completeasshole tells you:"WTF?"
You tell Completeasshole:"??"
Completeasshole tells you:"You trained us!!!  We all saw it!!"
You tell Completeasshole:"Your guy ran in and came out with a mob!"
Completeasshole tells you:"I don't think so.  You were the one who pulled
it.  Me and 2 other guys saw it."

Anyway, I could go on about everything said, but according to him his guy
running in (right by the mob to the left as you enter rcy) wasn't
responsible for pulling the mob (that's rich!) but was caused by me standing
there.  I asked him how when there are 7 of us standing there, why am I the
one who drew aggro?  Especially since the mob came out on the heels of his
buddy who came flying out of the room.  Then he accused me of pulling like
10 mobs.  I personally saw no more than one, but who knows what happened
after I bolted...
I could be wrong, but I don't think I'm the one that aggroed the mob.  I
explained to him that I thought I was doing the right thing by getting out
of their way since they were clearing the room (that's what it looked like
they were doing), and that no-one died, and I'm sorry if you had to beat up
a bunch of mobs, but if you can't handle trains then KC is no place for you
to be hunting.  He said something brilliant to the effect of "Welcome to
/petition".

Enter the GM...
I explained my side and he basically laughed and reiterated that KC is train
city, love it or leave it.

No more hassles from Completeasshole, but I did see him and a couple of his
comrades whining in /ooc and /shout that people were training them and "LCY
is NOT your personal train dumping ground"  That was a good one!  They bitch
about trains and go to....KC?  LCY in KC, no less?  Pu-leeeeeease!
My buddy in the group and I went to leave KC and log.  That's when we saw:
Completeasshole shouts:"TRAIN!!!!" and we zone out to sit and camp on other
side.  Soon Completeasshole and co. are sitting by us almost dead.  Everyone
piles out of KC and starts screaming that Completeasshole's group is a bunch
of Completeassholes.  Evidently they tried to take HWL room and pulled most
of the mobs in KC to zone.
Completeasshole shouts:"Hey, if you can't handle trains, stay out of KC?
What game are you playing?"

Oh well, some day Completeasshole will die.

Safe travels,
SEAN...
