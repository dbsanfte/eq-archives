relatively speaking, no...the problem is that if the players don't move with
the game, they fall behind...say you only owned original everquest...if you
tried to fight in kunark as a level 45 <whatever> wearing <whatever> that
you quested from antonica, you'd meet the same difficulties that everyone
went through 3+ years ago....the expansions are rather poorly planned,
stacking better gear and harder quests on top of what's currently available,
instead of blending in new content for all levels.....thus, yes...the 55+
zones of PoP are harder by a LONGSHOT than 55+ kunark or velious zones, and
if you can't keep up / catch up, you'll find you're obsolete when you try to
jump to the next expansion

it's going to get a lot worse

welcome to the party, pal . . no one likes pickup groups EXCEPT ninja
looters who can powerloot something without hurting anyone they know

on the bright side, nearly anyone can end up in a pickup group, even your
best-friend-to-be or guildmate-in-the-making

firstly, i would say you should just lie......add 15% to your hp and say ac
is 1250...it's a fucking game, not the IRS

when you move to harder zones, you won't be able to tank, not as main
anyway, sorry

within 5 levels, mobs are going to hit for 500, double, and yes, you need a
certain amount of man-hours invested in your gear, whether it's guild raids
to equip you over a few months, or a few months of your wiz/enc/clr/dru
selling spell casts or your SK farming some greenies to make
cash.....however you cut it, you won't be tanking unless you have that time
invested in your gear

on the bright side, you know how to pull, so you can very well be a
successfull full time puller, and as an SK you can pull aggro easily, so
while you might not be the best tank, you can tank for a little when you're
saving someone

that's a pretty good bright side......considering even an awesome warrior -
well beyond what's required to tank - will always be bested by another, and
that awesome warrior won't tank when the better man is around

that is how it goes...not a single person can say they're exempt from this,
not even the very best players in the world (how much of the at-the-time
best gear in the game have they destroyed because it's nodrop? they spent
months trying to beat xxx zone, but they've gone so far since then that
those items, while better than anything your or i own, are crap and signify
some kind of relative "buyer's remorse" since they could have done better if
this, if that...)


every minute i spend in the bazaar, i think "what an idiot i am; i paid 600p
of my hard earned cash on that, and it sells for 40p now"

you don't know the future, don't beat yourself up

here's a stupid ferinstance:
7 months ago i needed a nice sword for my warrior.....i had
5,000p.....there's a tae ew sword, 12/20 and str/sta/hp, and a frostbringer,
12/24 and has a frequent proc for aggro.........i bought the frosty, but
later realized the tae ew was much better, plus it looked COOOL....so i
traded.........now, the frosty is STILL 5k, sometimes 6 (though sometimes 4)
while the tae ew doesn't even go for 3k on my server

WHY?! i don't know.........this happens to everyone, frustrating as it is
