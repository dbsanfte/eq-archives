It seems a hell of a lot easier in EQ2 to me, but then I never played a
soloing class in EQ1.  So I can believe that someone who soloed their
necromancer or wizard in EQ1 thinks its harder.   It's just that they now have
it as hard as everyone else.  And classes like mine who had it super hard got
a bit of a reprieve.
