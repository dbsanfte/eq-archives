The continuing story of the froglock -Marrtuk makes me think that a dual eye
would be a unique part of the froglock life style.Hit 5 on the number pad
and you would be centered on "the straight a head"but use the mouse button
with the key board to use each eye to see what each wants.The screen would
,in the center,blur between the right eye and the left.It would be a great
advantage for a froglock,as you attack a mob you can look with one eye as
the other scans for enemies.And like a bard this is a skill to be learned to
use to your advantage.Hopefully I have given a good description of my idea.
Any way Good luck Marrtuk.
