You don't actually "delete" them, you just tell the game
not to load them next time.

To do that, when you first enter the game and get several
button options, click on "Options".  This will ask you
to reselect your video card and such, and about the third
screen will ask you (via checkboxes) which Luclin models
to load.  Just click off the ones you don't want, or even
all of them if you're having major disk-thrashing problems
due to not enough RAM on your computer.
