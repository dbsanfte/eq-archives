No, the Trader's Satchel in the Bazaar zone (10 slot, holds giant
items, costs under 2pp) did that, at least as far as bank space
goes.

I've seen handmade backpacks selling for as low as 30pp recently,
while the average seems to have settled between 40pp (if you want
to wait) and 60pp (if you don't.)
