One of the best things that happened to EQ.  There are some people playing
this game that are so "directionally challenged" they couldn't find their
hand in front of their face.  It gave those people (some of whom are quite
good players once they get where they are going) a fighting chance.  =)

It's good to note that *every* other game since EQ has had a mapping system
of some type.  There's a reason for that.

Having maps disabled in some zones borders on idiotic, or rather, borders
on calling *you* idiotic, as you've apparently lost the ability to put
pencil to paper upon entering the zone.
