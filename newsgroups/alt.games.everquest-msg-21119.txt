Stan,
And before that it was a different handle, changed to my real name
because that was how Brad was posting and I thought it only "fair" to
post like for like.

My oldest handle isn't hard to find and finding it will give you
something to do with all that free time you enjoy at work.

The email address has changed over time because of spam. I've always
posted with a valid email due to my stubborn willingness to receive
email from others.

Here's a hint: I've always used il128 in my email addy clear back to
1991.
If you try real hard you can find archived posts written by me about
online games all the way back as far as "Deja-News" goes.

If that isn't enough fun, you can always try and find my home address
and phone number, just don't post it here, email it to me and I'll
announce your victory here in the newsgroup. =8^)

What about you, Stan?  Any desire on your part to share your "time"
around EverQuest?

Twohead, 
I wasn't in alpha or even a closed beta, but I was *here* posting to
this newsgroup from the first month it went up.  A moot point but a
point none the less.  The only significance it holds, if any, is that
I'm aware of EverQuest's and this newsgroup's history.

You've been around for about as long as I can remember but I could be
wrong because like you said it has been years now, more than two in
fact.

I still own my aluminum foil hat.  I remember you granting me X-files
stature over a couple "GMs are cheating" claims I made here. Those GMs
are *gone* now. Over all it wasn't as important as I thought it was.

There was a time when I bitched a lot here.  I don't bother with that
anymore, mostly because compared to the way things were, there's
really nothing to bitch about now.  I've seen it all, been here for it
all and probably will be here when EQ rolls over and dies.  It won't
be the first online game I've watched die.  It'll be years from now
before that happens...  Don't take that the wrong way.

How about you, TwoHead?  Any desire on your part to share your "time"
around EverQuest?


DarkTyger,
My highest level character was a level 50 monk that was deleted in
December 1999.  The next character I've played to any level is a level
44 Human Necromancer.  I've never lead a guild and never will, I don't
have the free time for that or creating a single high level character.

Forgive me if I don't play for levels and I do share accounts with the
local computer club.  The rationalization for that is simple "we do
not have the time to play as individuals a avatar to a high level" so
we share and build avatars as a group.  It works very well for my
friends and me.

I don't need to and I can't play any characters up anymore and besides
I find that aspect of the game boring and tedious.  I do enjoy
well-organized raids though and I attend those once a week.


All,
Free time rules.

The *INFAMOUS* il128
