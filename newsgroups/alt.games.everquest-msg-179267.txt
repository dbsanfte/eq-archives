}First of all, my experiences last week in game.   Our enchanter said that a
}certain hobgoblin was going to be extremely pissed at her.   She had held it
}mezed for a couple minutes, on top of 4 slows, 3 resisted and one
}successsful.   I went over to the mob, taunted once then kicked it to break
}mez.    The mob attacked me and not the enchanter.

Ok, I know this is a week old because I'm that behind, and nobody cares 
anymore, but what the heck.  I actually agreewithyou about how taunt 
works, but that doesn't necessarily explain this stunning example.  If you 
mezzed a hobgoblin, you used either Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, or a 
higher mez.  -All- of those mezzes have a mem blur component... If the 
chanter had it on mezz lockdown for a couple minutes, there has to be more 
than one mez involved.  Any of the mezzes involved has a chance to 
completely clear the hate list.  So if the last thing she did was 
remezz, you may have leapt to the top of the hate list simply because you 
were closer to the mob than she was.  If she went mezz tash slow mezz slow, 
you might only be trying to out-taunt one slow, etc.

That's why, if mana hasn't been a problem, I frequently throw one extra 
mezz just as the tank's about to switch to my carefully prepared mob.
