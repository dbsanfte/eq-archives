Thank you for those links.  Now my other question since I am a LDoN newbie
is can you add an augment to an item that already has an effect?  Like if
you have a weapon that procs a DD can you add an augment to that and have
both Procs go off?  Also, if you have an item with a certain stat bonus and
add and augment that is the same stat do they add together for a total
increase in that stat?
