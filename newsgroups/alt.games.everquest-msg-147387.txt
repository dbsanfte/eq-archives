All the walkthroughs I've read about collecting the quest components for
Lambent armor say they can be collected solo by the time you are level
30-35.

What I'm looking for are solo strategies for getting the basalt carapace,
dropped by Basalt Gargoyles in Lower Guk, and the gypsy lute, dropped by
Gypsy Musicians in Mistmoore.

I'm asking for solo strategies because my guild is raiding more and more
these days during the hours I'm able to log in. I'm pretty certain I have
the lowest level main in my guild, so with a guild where everyone has their
mains and all their alts way over my level, I'm not able to group with any
of them very much. Also, the likelyhood of getting a decent pickup group
these days seems to be dropping off, especially in these two zones. No one
seems to be in Mistmoore anymore, and Lower Guk has more farmers than the
entire midwest.

So far I've only tried getting the basalt carapace twice. Both attempts
ended with my experience bar becoming dangerously low to dinging back to 37
from 38.

I have made several trips to Mistmoore (once to get my black silk gloves,
and only then with the help of a high level wizard friend) but I could never
work my way too far in, and I've never gotten as far as the castle itself.

I'm a level 38 wood elf bard, moderately equipped (all other lambent pieces,
except for 2nd bracer, and mostly +CHA and +DEX gear in other slots; I've
always favored songs to weapons to deal my damage)

If any veteran songweavers could either write up a little something about
what they did to get their quest drops, or point me to an online source,
they would have the eternal gratittude of a shiny blue bard  =)
