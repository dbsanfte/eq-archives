Hey y'all,

When you zone into the bazaar, you get a message saying that 'x' amount of 
buyers are interested in your gear. I've tried the buyer screen and I can't 
figure out how to find out what gear the buyers are after except by 
searching one item at a time through all of my stuff.

Is there a quicker way to find out what stuff the buyer is interested in?

TIA,

Mike W.
