You'd have had to have taken the boats to understand the frustration.  It was
never a *good / safe / dependable* form of travel.  Lag could knock you off the
boat or make you miss the dock or knock you into the water.  And it wasn't just
travel time *on* the boat, you had to wait for the darn thing to arrive.  If
lag got you as the boat was pulling up you had to wait for the next trip. 
ARGHHH..
