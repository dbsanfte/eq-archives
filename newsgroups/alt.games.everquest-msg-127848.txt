Lol.  John, I'm sorry if I hit a nerve here.  Reread my post.  I'm not
saying people should play this way.  I'm suggesting that the original poster
be tolerant of people who don't go outside of the game to find their
answers.  I respect both ways of playing.  I've played both ways myself.  I
like having the choice, and when I choose to ask the NPC's about things, it
would be nice not having someone who "did their homework" looking down on me
thinking, "The bonehead only had to say, 'what golden boomerang."   :)

A side note ... Verant says there are quite a few quests that are still
unsolved.  If this is true, I'd point my finger at an over-reliance on
spoiler sites.  Some people I have run across in Norrath won't even do a
quest until they've printed out the complete walkthrough!  Something to
think about....
