The last part is what I said: because the boats are gone, you cannot
get to Abysmal Sea except via Magus.  I admit I'm merely assuming that
you need LDON to use the Magus-port to Abysmal; it could be that GoD
is enough for that one, since it's sort of different from the other
Magi.  But if you hail other Magi when you haven't got your LDON stone,
they tell you to go talk to someone else, so I suspect the Nedaria and
Natimbi magi likewise won't even tell you about the Abysmal port unless
you have the stone.

I do admit that it's possible to reach Nedaria's Landing without LDON,
but you still need both LDON and GoD to get to Abysmal.
