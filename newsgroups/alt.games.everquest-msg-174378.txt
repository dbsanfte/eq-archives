Pox is level 59, which I was not at the time.  I also have not been able to
get a copy of Pox yet.  I was using Plague and Bane.  I was going easy on
Bane, as I would run out of mana if I kept it applied at all times.  With
the epic, I use just Bane, about 4 times for most of the mobs near the GY in
PoN, the rest is epic DoT damage.  Still looking for Pox, lots more damage,
around the same mana cost as Bane.
