Why are you worried about the wisdom on the weapon.  Worry about the 
effectiveness as a weapon.  That is so far above how much wisdom it 
provides in importance.  You are a melee who casts spells, not a caster 
who swings a sword.

You should not be worrying about how much wisdom is on the armor either, 
worry about how much AC/HP it has.

I have a ranger twink, his bow has zero wisdom on it.  I don't care, the 
primary purpose of the bow is to do damage.

Which only matters if your buffed stamina is below 100.

I can't say on that subject, I have never seriously looked.

You may very well be right that ranger equipment at low prices is 
inferior, I honestly don't know.  I would suggest however that you not 
use Wisdom as the search stat for a ranger, if your concern is his 
ability to tank and/or provide DPS.
