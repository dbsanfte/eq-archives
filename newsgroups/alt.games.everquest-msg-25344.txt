Runs extremely well on my system, with the exception of sound
problems.

Using the on-board sound module on my new motherboard, I have adequate
sound effects at consistent volumes, which is quite playable. I have
no music, however (which is fine, as I don't listen to it anyhow).

With my previous setup, EQ didn't get along with my SBLive at *all*,
and the sound in-game was awful. My solution was to just shut the
sound off entirely.

I may be going back to the SBLive soon, however, due to hardware
situations entirely unrelated to EQ.
