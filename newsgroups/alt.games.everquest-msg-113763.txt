My wife and I discovered this during our porting for cash days that
lasted about 2 months, although we used "Whatever you can afford" and
I let her do this part. We couldn't believe how much plat guys will
lay down to impress a female.

We were averaging over 30p a person. Course we did a lot of free and
2p ports along with the highest at 250p and 3 wis earring. Cant begin
to list the other magic items we got in trade. Then again we treated
them like kings, sowed, camoed, healed as needed and made sure they
got in safe. Lots of repeat biz and a few new friends. 

Outfitted 2 druids in nice gear very quickly using this method. So its
not a bad deal for anyone. Porting is without a doubt the most
realistic business in EQ, you are rewarded for good service and people
will seek you out if they liked the service.
