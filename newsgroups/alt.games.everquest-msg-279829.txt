I don't see why it should go very very badly.  You should still be able
to tank against level appropriate mobs whereas twinks can tank against
things that they shouldn't really be able to handle.  A problem could
arise if you group outside of the guild because their expectations will
be that you can handle the mobs that they see as level appropriate.

The path to uberness *will* be much longer without the shortcuts which
twinking allows but the path does go all the way there for those that
are determined enough.  (Of course when you get there you'll find that
it moved and left another path for you to follow)
