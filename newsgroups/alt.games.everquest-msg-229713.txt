Ok, posts that are for EQII might reasonable be considered to be off topic here,
but not so much as some of the other stuff that gets posted here (admittedly,
sometimes by myself).  As the approach date for EQII approaches, I think we will
see more and most posts about it popping up here, until someone creates
alt.games.everquestII.  I know that many here are not interested in EQII, so for
my part I will mark posts I start on this subject at EQII, so they can be
ignored more easily by those that wish to do so.

    Anyways, the full class tree has been released in the form a puzzle.

clean up the formatting, but I tend to mess such things up.
