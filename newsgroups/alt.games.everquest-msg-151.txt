Higher than newbie undead spawn at night in the area where the named
Gnolls usually do, They just stand there so you have to get into aggro
range to set them off. I have never seen a mummy, but I know if you
keep killing the Skeletons that spawn there, sooner or later you'll
get the Zombie to spawn assuming you don't run out of night first.
