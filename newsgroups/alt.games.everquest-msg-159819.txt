Everyone who does not play a Druid or Wizard will find PoP's port system
very useful.  My 11 Cleric tonight checked out Crushbone, the Warrens, and
Kurn's, in about 20 minutes or so.  That would be very hard without PoP.

Also, I think you are understimating the average player.  I seem to recall
that Sony said that the majority of *accounts* have at least one 50+
character.
