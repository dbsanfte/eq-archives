Sullon Zek, most definitely.  It's very low population, and *very* fun to
play, trust me (if you don't mind occasionally getting slaughtered by
members of other PvP teams :) ).  Try it though, I always say you haven't
lived till you've played SZ.  If you do want to start a char there, pick a
good (as opposed to evil or neutral) deity, so you'll be on my team, and msg
me... my char is Mekail.  Or if I'm not on then msg someone in my guild
(Fatalus Invictus) and ask them when I'll be on/tell them you were looking
for me and I'll msg you.  One thing you have to have is friends and I
haven't had any good noobs to help out lately :)  The good team on that
server is ridiculously underpopulated.
