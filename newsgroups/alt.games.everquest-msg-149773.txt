No?  I've been happily wearing an Enshrouded Veil for ages
now, as the drop in cost from 600 to 400 was quite helpful,
and the drop off in mana over my junky velium whatever
mask (str 8 wis 8, you know, the kind any self respecting
level 30 non twink is wearing) wasn't noticable.

If a tank dies because I didn't have 180 more mana, frankly
odds are very strong he was going to die anyway.  180
mana is just barely enough for a remedy... how many fights
come down to squeezing out one more remedy?  And if I DO
get that remedy out, guess what?  Mob is still probably going
to eat the tank.  Further, pet is cast at the beginning of the
battle, when I'm likely FM, and likely have some time to
med.  Just as one might drop a nuke on a mob near battle
start in order to not waste med time, now you cast pet instead.

More to think about; the pet has a respectable DPS itself
(I'm not talking about sending in a druid pet, for comparison)
and may very well end up contributing sufficient damage to
kill the target mob before healing the tank runs me out of
mana, while without his assistance, the extra what, remedy?
I could squeeze out would probably not let the tank live
sufficiently longer to put out comperable total damage.

Having grouped with shaman, slow does not make heals
not an issue... they make shaman heals a contender, but
with a slower and a cleric, the shaman still isn't the healer,
you just go after harder mobs.  Given the new "higher
rewards for higher mobs" plan, I laugh maniacally to think
how slow plus CHeal works in our favor.

The new heals appear to suck, actually, I'm not clear why
there's such a fuss.  Heal you up to 75% but not more than
2000 hp?  So if you are wimpy, you get healed to 75% but
who cares, you can't tank.  And if you are a real tank, then
you don't get 75% healed, you get something closer to
50% healed.  Compare to a cleric dropping a CHeal on that
same tank, burning less mana to get 100% healed... or
dropping a remedy or celestial healing on those injured
"light tanks".   In an exp group, mana efficiency is the
key to success; a cleric spends less mana per hp healed,
so he can speed your kills per hour rate.

Well they could upgrade the entire line of cleric hammers, frankly,
not one of which till this recent patch has ever been worth weilding,
since they were no drop you couldn't use them to supply a tank
so he could help fight back to the bodies, and they were wimpy
enough in a cleric's hands that you couldn't fight your way thru
crushbone
with one on a CR.
