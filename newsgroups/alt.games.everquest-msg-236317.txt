As the others said, you have to actually buy the expansions to use
them.  The book takes you to the plane of knowledge, which is part of
the planes of power.  If you bought EQ: Evolution, that should have
got you all the expansions through Legacy of Ykesha.  

If you just got EQ: Trilogy, you should have probably paid the extra
20 bucks and got Evolution.
