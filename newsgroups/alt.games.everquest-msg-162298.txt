I use the same trackball, but I was using a trackball long before getting EQ.

A trackball isn't really a gaming tool per se, its an alternative setup for a
mouse.

I love having a little tiny control that I can put in my lap or next to my
keyboard, never have to find room for  a pad, not have to worry about pad plus
mouse, not have to worry about running off the side of the pad... its a much
smoother tool for me for every mouse purpose.

But the optical trackball is worlds better than the others I used in the past,
because it stays cleaner, and when dirty is extremely easy to clean, even mid
combat.

The only problem I have is that when, as occaisonally happens, the thing is
dropped, the ball instantly pops out and goes on vacation; its a very good
roller and loves the game of Hide and Seek.

I usetrackball for some targetting, and for almost all character selecting and
spell casting (hotkey or spell icon) and item click activating, I use keyboard
for movement and a few commands like assist that are in the same place on every
character on every hotkey panel.  I _should_ use the keyboard more than I do,
but instead I've been moving things around on the UI to cut trackball travel
time down.  I just love having visual confirmation of what I'm about to do.
I've used mouselook a few times for movement, but I use it so much for other
purposes that this became difficult.
