The Sleeper (11-17-03)

Over the weekend several guilds gathered on Rallos to fight with the 
Sleeper.  Unfortunately, their encounter was cut short due to an 
apparent bug.

I wanted to take a moment here and apologize to those that were there, 
and to those that have heard about the event through their friends.  The 
bug concerned an NPC in the zone that appeared to have been causing the 
Sleeper to not focus on the player characters.  The decision was made at 
the time to end the event.  Further investigation has only served to 
make it unclear if this was a real issue or not.

I, on behalf of the company, apologize for any consternation this may 
have caused during your play time.  If anyone is going to defeat the 
Sleeper, it should be done without any question about the validity of 
the event.  We're very sorry that this first attempt was halted, but at 
the time it seemed like the best thing to do.

We have resurrected and restored those that participated.  We have 
corrected the potential problem, and have reset the encounter.  Other 
than that one potentially problematic NPC, nothing else about the 
encounter has been changed.

We want to wish those on Rallos that are planning to tackle the Sleeper 
the best of luck.

Send me some screenshots of all of you standing around the corpse, I'd 
love to post them on the site.

Thank you and thanks for understanding,

Alan
