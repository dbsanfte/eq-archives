I can confirm this. I actually tried first downloading the most recent 9.0c 
version and it didn't work. SoE provided a link on the official forums to 
the specific version required. All I know is that installing the version 
from their link *did* update my DX base (as opposed to just running through 
a quick check and finding that nothing needed updating) and EQ worked 
afterward.
