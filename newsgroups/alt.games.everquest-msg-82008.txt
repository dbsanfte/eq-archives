Yep a monk

I remember paying 2k just for a runed lava pendant (0.1 weight, lets bump
the price up!!)
Yep haste is damn expensive, id love to buy the stuff i don't win on raids,
or equip a twink... most melees in my guild are bound in SH, on a guild raid
wipeout, we all go to the arena - its brilliant fun, monks versus
trolls/ogres (warrs, shamans and sk's) they can grab a great sword or
bp/shield from the bank to use, we for the most part only possess what were
currently wearing (with the exception of resist gear)

Id never take cash for that.. when i've stopped my whole seb group, to help
some dead people get their bodies to the zoneline for example (and sometimes
died myself in the process) I won't accept anything for it.

At the same time I don't pay for rezzes.  If i can't get my cleric there, or
a r/l friend isnt there (4 r/l friends are all 56+ clerics heh) there is
generally always somebody who owes me a favour or 2
