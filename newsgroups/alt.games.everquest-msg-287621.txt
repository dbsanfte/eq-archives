I think he's referring to the necro AA flesh to bone or whatever its 
called.   I think there's also a weapon which procs bits of raw meat, 
which you can then make homemade pet food with via that AA.

Sadly as an SK I have a skellie pet like some of yours, but no flesh to 
bone AA.   Farm run to Kurns every month or so takes care of the problem.
