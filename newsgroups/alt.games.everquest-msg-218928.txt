The 58 druid heal is much better than the shaman version.   Although I don't
completely agree with it, I believe the reason he ranked shamans above
druids was cannibalize.  The massive boost to mana regen that it gives
allows shamans to cast thier lesser heal much more frequently... which might
be enough to bump them up to second place in the healing.

(Note that this is only because slow was included as a second catagory.
When it is included in the healer analysis, shamans are the clear second
place, if not first. (Unless, of course, another slower is provided for.
Then druids are clearly second.))
