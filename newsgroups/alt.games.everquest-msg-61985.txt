If you can arrange to have both computers up at the same time, connect
them together over ethernet, and copy your whole EQ directory over,
rather than reinstalling EQ.  The advantage of this is that you won't
have to download all the patches on the new machine, and you'll get
*everything* you might want to keep (besides character settings, how
about screenshots or logs?).

After copying everything, you can go find everquest.exe, and make a
shortcut to that for your desktop or start menu or task bar or
wherever you like to start EQ from.
