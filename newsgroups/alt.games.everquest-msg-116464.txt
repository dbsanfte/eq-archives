	As the other fellow pointed out, except for genuine new subscribers,
anyone who was at all serious about playing a Ranger would have at least tried
it long before the pecks showed up.

	Those would be the two main ones, though.  (Panic Animal hasn't done us
any favors either; made it trivial to solo a Ranger into his 50s, which draws
even more powergaming idiots.)

	It is a plague.  You don't understand how Verant judges game balance.
They don't use things like mathematical analysis -- they consider a class to
be balanced according to how popular it is.  If they see a lot of people
playing a class, they figure it must be OK and move on.  That means things
that make your class more popular without actually improving its ability to
perform in primary game activities -- like Panic Animal, or pecks -- are bad.

	The worst thing that happened to classes like Rogues, Druids and
Necromancers was getting flooded with nitwit twinks.  (If you want to have a
good time, go to the Safehouse and post "I just started a new Rogue and I got
80K to spend on him, what should I buy?  Oh, and what level do I have to be to
get the epic?")  I don't want them flooding into my class.
