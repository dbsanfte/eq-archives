Know what I think?  Good, I'll tell you anyway...  I think you (and this
other fuck) are just spoiled wanna-be-uber punks who got treated properly
for making wiseass remarks at a GM/Guide who was trying to help.

Blah, thats not really true heh...

I don't think the GM/Guide did jack shit with your precious uber-spawn
chump.  But it's a shame they didn't.  Were I that GM, I would have hurried
immediately back here to a.g.e to watch your pathetic sub-coherent ramblings
about having been 'had by the man'.

The fact that you even have to wonder if it was related to what the
guildmate or other player said makes me think they said a little more than
the "god what a waste of time that GM was" and you fucking know it.

Kinda funny when spoiled fuckers get smacked down like that.

Precious, thanks for sharing!
