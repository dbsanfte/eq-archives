Has any had any problems with EQ freezing when there is alot of movement on
the screen?  The graphics freeze but I can still hear stuff going on in the
background, so it isnt freezing completely.  This happens mostly during
fights, a lot of spell effects, etc.

I am using a VooDoo 5 AGP in Windows ME with AMD 800 Mhz with 640 MB ram.

I also had my screen go completely blank as if it was going into suspend
mode, as the indicator on my monitor went from green to yellow.

I would love to upgrade the video card but dont have the cash right now.

TIA, Danny
