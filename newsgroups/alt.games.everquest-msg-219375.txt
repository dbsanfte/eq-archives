I've got no issues with that, I agree that infinite wealth generators 
are a bad thing. Drop based tradeskills don't suffer from this, btw.

Agreed. Because there is no point in working up a skill just for 
creating worthless items.

But I don't want it easy. I just don't want it a tedious clickfest.
Many things in EQ are difficult, many things in EQ take a lot of time... 
... but most of them are fun, or at least can be amusing. Tradeskilling 
is just a pain in the ass. sit in some corner...click-drag, click-drag, 
click-drag, combine... repeat until you are a GM.

Then again on some level what could be easier..., a rhesus monkey could 
probably master a trade in EQ. Maybe that's the problem; its too easy... 
look up recipes on eqtraders, read a couple guides, and away you go... 
two wrist operations later your a GM.

Mudflation vs Tradeskills is easy to resolve... simply make the new uber 
items crafted from the new drops plus the old tradeskill items. People 
would still need banded armour if it was a required component along the 
line to the latest in-demand thing...

Agreed.
