Excuse?

Earthlionk does not own SuperNews. SuperNews is owned by Critical Path, 
although I suspect they will be under the Earthlink umbrella soon.

That was just a guess on the link. My supernews access comes with my ISP 
access. I am familiar with the corporate accounts management procedures, 
but not the personal accounts procedures.

I have heard from many that newsguy.com is a good news provider.
