}Root is very annoying, it changes the way aggro works on the mob to 
}Proximity instead of hate list.  While this is workable, its not what 
}your tanks are used to, and can be troubling in tight quarters and on 
}mobs with a small melee box.  Then it wears off, and the mob goes back to 
}hate list... and you haven't had any access to what that list was during 
}the rooted portion of the fight (well, if the melee were on it, that is).  
}Root also takes time and mana to cast, and you have to have someone who's 
}dedicated a spell slot to it.

That is a valid objection.  I'd say what you know about the hate list 
before casting root, though, is that the enchanter is at the top, and what 
you know after it wears off is that the enchanter is much less likely to 
be at the top, as opposed to one of the melees.  Melees really should have 
figured out how proximity aggro works at about oh, level 20...  And prox. 
aggro always applies, rooted or not.  It's just good policy to have the MT 
closest and the other melee a bit further away yet still in range.

}If you, the enchanter, are going to do the rooting, then why not mem blur
}instead?  Takes the same spell slot, similar mana, and instead of adding hate,
}subtracts hate.  Then when your tanks go in with a single taunt, odds are good
}that whatever hate there may still be left for you will be overcome.

Root casts in 1.75-2 sec, recasts in 2.25-3 sec, costs 30-100 mana, 
depending on which one.  Mem blur (just the basic one) is 40 mana, yes, 
but 2.5 seconds cast, and that extra half a second can get you 
interrupted, recasts in -12- seconds, and only wipes the hatelist about 
20-30% of the time.  if root only sticks for a second or two, that's 
frequently long enough for me to back up and hence move down the hatelist.  
There are higher level mem blurs, but they tend to become even more 
prohibitive.

Mind wipe  - Area of effect spell.  Which can be useful, but 100 mana and 
  still doesn't work much more than 20-30% of the time, and if the mobs 
  are social and one resists... well, remember how AoE pacify used to be? 
Memory flux - Better odds of it sticking.  Probably 50-60% success.  But 
  -350- mana.
Blanket of Forgetfulness - AoE again, 40-50% chance of it working per 
  mob for 175 mana.
Reoccurring Amnesia - Reoccurring mem blur, like a mem blur dot. Very 
  odd hatelist behaviour when it suddenly works late in the fight. Medium 
  odds of it working (maybe 50%), for 100 mana.

They all have a 12 second recast.  So if it doesn't work the first time, 
you'll be finishing the fight without an enchanter.  Note that the percent 
chance of it working I gave is -not- counting resists.  If the spell lands 
at all, it still frequently doesn't do a damn thing.  I've actually had 
nearly as good luck clearing aggro with mez as any blur line spell.  They 
give percentages on lucy, with mezzes varying from 1-2% and mem blurs 
varying from 10-30%, but those don't seem to jibe with reality so well.

It's something to keep in mind for those mobs that are being really 
persnickety about root, or that I don't want a faction hit on.  But in 
general, it's not as likely to save my life.

Don't forget also, that when memblur works, it clears the whole hatelist, 
it doesn't just take the enchanter off.  So if your cheal lands just after 
my mem blur sticks, you's a Dead Cleric.  It's also definitely not the 
spell of choice if you actually -want- the faction hits from whatever 
you're fighting.

}If you have a paladin going in, instead of root I'd reccomend a stun, 
}very annoying to the mob, and it keeps it locked in place for six seconds 
}of taunting and melee, usually plenty of time to firmly cement aggro on 
}the pally, and its exceptionally cheap, very effective tool that the 
}pally should always have memmed anyway.

Stuns are a Very Good Thing.  I've been finding way too many mobs that are 
completely unstunnable lately though.  'Course, there's way too many 
unrootables as well. :)

It takes rather special circumstances for me to be fighting with no stuns 
memmed at all.  Like, being in Kael or HoT.  The same can be said of root.  
But memblur is pretty much a toy for killing mobs I don't want the faction 
hit on, like othmir farming.
