Well, I'm not going to go into detail, but I have personally fucked up the
Langsaxe quest 4 times in the last 2 nights.  We still got 3 Langsaxes,
though.  My partner is a RL buddy who plays ( like yourself ) a lvl 17
Barbarian Warrior.  This is one of his stupid stories of last night:

We each got a bandit head in WK from Basil.  I gated to Halas to turn mine
in ( after grabbind more meat from the gal at the fishing village ).  I turn
mine in, but it didn't work.  I had cast Benevolance, but the "amiable"
wasn't high enough.  I shoulda used Illusion Barb, I guess.  Anyway, I take
off for Everfrost to give the damned bear his treat ( after getting it from
the gal in Halas ).  I finally find Iceberg, when my buddy zones into
Everfrost and promptly sends an /ooc message ( why he just didn't ask me,
I'll never know... ) of...

"Who do I give head to?"

I almost puked, I was laughing so hard.  I'm sure everyone in Everfrost was
laughing pretty hard, too, judging by the responses.

He won't be able to show his face in Halas again...  ( especially at the
bank with the faction hits we're taking - gotta kill some more mammoth
calves, now ).

On his whiteboard at work, we put the nightly: SMOTD ( stupid move of the
day )  I guess it should be night, but bah.  Each morning at work, the 4 of
us who play get together and share our stupid move from the night before.
It's amazing that we have any characters over level 6 with some of the stuff
we have done
