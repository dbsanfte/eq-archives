I am pretty sure that the haste cap is 100% up to level 65, so that chart 
would still apply.

Depending on how much you have to spend, your best bet is likely the 
Flowing Blach Silk Sash, or the Silver Chitin Handwraps.  The SCHW is 
better because it has actual stats, and allows you to put a decent belt 
on your character too, but many people have made do with the FBSS.  On 
EMarr the FBSS usually sells for under 2k now, maybe as low as 1.4k, the 
SCHW is still usually over 2k, maybe 2.5k to 3k.  If those prices are too 
high for you, then, I'd suggest farming tradeskill items, like pelts, 
spider(ling) silks, and selling them to raise cash.  You could check out 
the Hangman's Noose, if you can find one for sale, it's 17% haste with 
crappy stats vs 21% for FBSS, and 22% for SCHW.

If you group with an enchanter normally, then at level 16 they get a 28% 
to 30% (at level 20) haste spell which will stack with your item.  This 
means that you will be haste capped with an SCHW + Enchanter haste until 
you hit level 50, and the haste cap bumps up to 74%.  By the time the 
enchanter is level 18, the FBSS will haste cap you, so, it's a very 
viable alternative as well.  If you do not group with an enchanter 
regularly, then, get the highest haste item you can afford.  Shaman 
eventually can cast haste as well, but that is not until level 29.
