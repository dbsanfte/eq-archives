The wizard was being a jerk about how he approached the situation, OTOH, the
rogue should not have been trying to steal the wizard's camp.  The wizard
had been there sitting on his ass for 4 hours waiting for the spawn, rogue
pops in 10 minutes before the spawn, who should be the one to get the spawn?
I would hope that if the wizard had been a bit more polite to begin with
that the rogue would not have taken the camp, that's not the impression I
get from the posts, but I don't know.  The impression I get is that said
rogue felt that the camp was his, because he had killed Hadden several
times, and then camped out, only to come back at the spawn time.  That's
total bullshit.  And, yes, the wizard was an idiot for saying what he did,
and then KSing.
