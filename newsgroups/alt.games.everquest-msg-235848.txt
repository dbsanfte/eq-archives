Having built and configured more computers than I want to think about,
do a fresh install of Windows XP and install the programs you need.
This will give you a lot less hassles in the future than mirroring the
data to the new drive and trying to update all the drivers. It is more
labor intensive at the beginning but will reduce by far the problems
you could have in the future. Once you have installed the programs you
want from the CDs ( except EQ which has no register settings and
places it's DLLs in it's own directory rather than the various Windows
directories that other programs do ). After the installation and
installing any patches needed you can copy the program directories
from your old hard drive over your new hard drive and tell it to copy
over all files on the programs that you installed on the new computer.
With EQ just copy the directory onto your new computer and create an
icon on your desktop for the EverQuest.exe for the game and for
testeverquest.exe for the test server.

My way is slower than ghosting but creates a lot less problems in the
future and you will get a much more solid installation of Windows XP.
I only used Ghost or other programs of it's type when working with a
lot of computers with the same hardware. Change the hardware and you
had to clean up all the conflicts and driver issues.. Later there were
programs to make an image of a hard drive, install all the programs
needed and then make a difference file that could be dropped onto any
computer with the same OS. Not the situation that you have here.

Bite the bullet and and do it the long way and you will be happier in
the long run.
