My old computer exploded dramatically, and the new one is a monster
AMD 1800 and GeForce III, so this may not be representative, but yes,
it seemed very fast with a few minor glitches - the eye slit in my
tolans helm was "sealed", you couldnt see my eyes, the cursor didnt
quite match the text I was typing and so forth.

The graphics themselves were identical - just much quicker. More
importantly though, it was rock solid stable which is *not* something
I would have said about DX7; This is on windows 2000 too.
