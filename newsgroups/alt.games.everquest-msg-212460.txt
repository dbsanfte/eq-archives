No sooner than I post this yesterday, a trader named 'Zipps' puts a 1000 of
the
darn things on the trader for 5pp each.....what a downer.

Anywho Aoebe got to level 25 last night, last night in PC probably too.

Se picked up the Golden Efreeti boots for 1600pp, actually bought two pair,
and tossed the second set to a shaman friend of her's (a lower alt).

Got the charred guardian sheild, a dark ember, and some vase thing that is
nice.

The wrists have the Imbued bracers for Rodcet Nife, along with greaves, and
that is on top of the fine antique veil and ring quests.   Wis is at 176 and
that is where
she is leaving it for now.

The cash has all but stopped until zipps sells his 1000 kiolas, that will
take a while.
Since the ones that sold a few days ago for 10 pp each, there has been less
of a desire
to sell for less.

The Solstice earring is next, and Aeobe will be careful not to munch on the
goodies to get it.

Focus items are Improved healing II, mana preservation II, and something
that
has improved damage I, to help the *smite* spell.

Lastly, the last trip to PC, Aoebe was able to keep everyone alive without
an issue,
looted darn near everything, all the while saying if anyone wanted anything,
sing out,
and covered the cost of the bloodstones used.

Aoebe is looking forward to her first giant encounter, but is a bit timid,
even at 25,
as she has friends that have had their head handed to them, (actually tossed
off to the
side, rolling down the hill to the Oasis of Marr), and thinks she'll wait
one or two more
levels.
