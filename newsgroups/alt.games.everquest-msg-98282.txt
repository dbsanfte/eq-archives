That was REALLY a newbie question.. A number 1 newb question..

But... since we all been there, (i just had to comment.. sorry..) This is
how it goes :

Yes.. it is "kind of" being delt out by the NPC's.. Eg. You walk up to an
NPC, and push the "H"ail button.. The NPC then responds : Welcome my
friend.. bla bla bla.. to kill all those dreadded [rockhoppers]..
You then say : What rockhoppers (The line you say must include the words in
[] from the NPC.)
The NPC respons : Bring me 4 rockhopper tails, and i will reward you well..

The QUEST here is : Kill rockhoppers, and loot 4 tails from them, then walk
back to the npc, and then give him 4 tails (at once to get the reward.. PS.
tips: Stackable items must be "unstacked" in each own slot). You then get
some thing, xp ++ from the NPC.

To better get an idea, i recomend you find the area you are in, and check if
there is any well known quests here :

Good luck..

CyberMax

PS. I am a newb myself.. just as you all know it .. :)
