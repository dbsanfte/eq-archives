I have a level 10 (WOOT!) Troll SK that I only play occasionally, but was
going to put a little more time into it recently.  I have a few questions
regarding their pets:

I know they are several levels lower, seemingly almost a complete joke.  I
don't think I've ever grouped with a SK that uses one.  Is this because of
their relative uselessness I assume?  I would think that even a little extra
damage would be welcome.
Is it even worth buying higher level pet spells as they become available?

TIA,
Sean...
