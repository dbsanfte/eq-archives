A friend of mine, tired of me turning him down for POV groups,
decided to get me flagged.

65 paladin, 65 monk, 64 enchanter, 61 wizard, 62 ranger, and me,
63 cleric.

First time in, we got thru 3 waves and the wizard was running
LOM.  Got thru the 4th wave only by me nuking.  Boss popped, I
was at 40M.  Ran OOM healing, the paladin was already out of
LOH... he died just before BP CHeal hit, everyone else died in
fairly short order, I almost managed to get a gate off after DB
but not quite.  Mob was at 40% when I died, last.

Second run, after I'd explained to the wizard how to use his
horse (old model for his race, horses on) and we discussed a few
minor strategic changes, I nuked precisely one mob, a named, and
entered the final mob at 80M  (would have been more, but the
pally didn't listen to me an let his buff slots fill up so that
with tash and BP Cheal icon on he didn't have a slot free for
SE... I had to SR him three times in wave 3 while we discussed
the issue.

By the time the boss died I was down to 20% mana.

Five marks rotted.

Notes:  Both times the enchanter was utterly unable to get a
functioning slow on, I can personally attest that the boss was
hitting very hard and very fast the first round...as he beat me
into a pulp when he finally got around to it.  No 50% slow, no
80% slow that counted as 40%, nothing.

Paladin much better at grabbing aggro than the warriors I've
tried this with in the past.  Healing aggro on those mobs is
maddening.. except that the paladin throwing out heals is getting
exactly what he wants, healing everyone in the group so I don't
have to, and pulling the mobs onto himself where I want it, so SE
can do the job.

Horses are a great addition.  Most of the difference between
round one and two came from just one thing; the wizard got on his
horse.  This meant all that time he spent standing so as not to
get aggro counted as medding.  He didn't get sit aggro trying to
med at bad times, he had substantially more mana.. nuked more
thru the first three waves and still had mana to go thru the
whole fourth wave.  I was already aware of this, having spent
about 50 tries at it before getting a horse, and 50 more after.

Getting to the final mob is the hard part.  The final mob is no
cakewalk... I failed to him four times before success, but when
you consider that I only saw him about 6 times in over a hundred
tries, its clear that the waves are the hardest part.  On the
other hand, I could have seen him more often, on several
occaisions I called for a deliberate fail when it was clear I
wasn't going to have enough mana for the final kill.  That was
estimating I'd need 50% of my mana bar for the boss... when this
final success used 60% with a level 65 MA with better equipement
than anything my previous MAs have had.

How did we get there?  The old fashioned way.  MA aggroed the
mobs, chanter mezed adds and slowed them.  Damage classes
assisted MA and did damage.  I used SE as much as possible, with
a couple CHeals near end of waves for added efficiency over more
SE (same cost, lots more HP healed.. but can't use it much during
waves or I get aggro, which slows down damage production.
