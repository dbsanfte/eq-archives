Thanks to you and everyone else for the tips. Update: We went in for a
couple of hours last night. I fully agree that one or two more people
would have certainly helped at times, (and I'll be checking for any
interested guildies of appropriate level for our next outing) but we
managed ok with no deaths and great xp for the cleric. 

Invis vs. undead is one *great* spell here! :-)  I was able to explore
and map out the first floor without problems and figure out what to pull
where.  Since the cleric could sooth some of the multiple groups, we
were able to pull manageable amounts.  The first time we got the large
undead gnoll, we took him down to about 1/3 health and HE GATED! WTF IS
UP WITH THAT? I thought mobs didn't get gate until much later on!
Anyway, we got him one more time and he got a mammoth helping of stuns
and nukes towards the end and we killed him. I immediately decided that
*I* should loot the key, since the cleric has gate and can get out
whenever she wants. DOH! Getting *OUT* isnt't the problem, Einstein!
Getting *BACK IN* is. So now we have to stay on the first floor for our
next session until we both have a key.

Anyway, only cleared the first floor thus far, but this is one sweet
little dungeon at our levels. Can't wait to see the library. Oh, yes...
and I'm back in hell again. May as well spend it in the library as
anyplace else, I suppose. *sigh*.
