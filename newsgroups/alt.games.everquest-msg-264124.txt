	I wish ya the best of luck man. =>  Ya gotta use your 
membership to become a state supreme court justice so ya can 
get me in to the bar the easy way. hehe  One of the 
positions is running unopposed this election I think.

	Did you ask the right guy, I have a lot of experience 
avoiding it.  I'm just too lazy and uninterested, even 
though I know it would be in my best interest.  I have 
little to no intention of using it if I were to pass it, 
though it would be nice to have that door open should I ever 
change my mind, which I realize is very possible.  I have 
signed up for it and not shown up something like 8 times. 
hehe.  I don't even know the number its been so many times, 
and considering its only given twice a year, that's saying 
something. hehe

	Of course, some of my time not studying for these various 
bar exams was spent playing video games, but that was time 
well spent. I have my priorities ya know.

	First time though I did show up for the PR part, and passed 
it, but it has expired so I'll have to retake that if  I 
ever retake the bar.  One other time I was gonna lose my fee 
(can only transfer it so many times due to 'skipping' the 
bar before ya finally lose it) so I went ahead and sat for 
it.  Absolutely no studying though, took it cold, several 
years after having graduated, not even a recent prep class. 
  I knew I wouldn't have a hope of passing, but figured it'd 
be good practice so I'd really know what it was like. And 
shocker of all shockers, I actually made it into the appeals 
range (the only circumstance I know of where you can 
actually find out what your score was).

	Out of 180 points, ya have to be w/in 3 points of passing 
to make the appeals range.  Then ya can even see your 
answers, and their individual scores, pick 3 and have them 
regraded by new people who don't even know what ya got the 
last time, and if ya make up the points - ya pass, if not, 
ya don't.  I didn't pick my 3 very well though 'cause I 
didn't make it.  =<  Was shocked I had remembered enough 
cold to do that well though so it was a positive experience 
and made me realize the test ain't as hard as its made out 
to be.  Plus, I got to see my own answers and their scores 
and see exactly where my weak spots were, pretty nice since 
I was gonna lose my money anyways, at least this way I got 
something for it.  But ya do need to study, I can attest to 
that.

	3 days, 8 hours a day for the first 2 days, for the 
substantive portion.  I forget how many hours for the PR 
portion on the third day, not as many as 8 though.  All 
essay.  An endurance test as much as anything else.  The PR 
portion is cake, though I've known people to not pass it.

	Are ya gonna type or write it?  I wrote, because then I 
could write small and fit more words into less space (though 
I can type 80-120 wpm).  But man, its punishment on the 
writing hand.

	Hmm, bar review courses.  There's Rigos, which I've taken 
(but didn't sit for the bar afterwards, again - lazy).  They 
were pretty good though, nice and concise since the test is 
only over blackletter law - so they don't waste your time 
w/anything else.  Plus they hand grade any practice answers 
ya give them giving ya lots of pracice.  Then there's bar 
bri, which I took right after graduation, and again, didn't 
use since I kept skipping the bar exam for several years.  I 
didn't like them too much and stopped showing up, and they 
try and force ya to attend all their classes when really all 
I need from such a course is up to date materials to see 
what I need to catch up on - yet their materials kinda 
sucked (they give you 2 sets.  One is useless as it has too 
much detail seeing how the bar is only over blackletter law. 
  The other set is concise but has all sorts of fill in the 
blank crap to try and force ya to attend all the classes, 
which again is quite bogus).  They had some good speakers 
and all, but that was right after graduation and right when 
I just burnt out on it all and decided to drop any plans I 
had to practice law.

	If you sign up for a course lemme know and what ya think of 
it, though I'm not gonna be doing a review course ever again 
myself for sure (way too much money for something I'm likely 
to just not use, yet again).  Though the up to date 
materials themselves are probably well worth it, since the 
exam will cover recent changes, though I guess ya can be up 
to a year out of date w/out having anything held against 
you.  I should probably start subscribing to advance sheets 
or something as a cheaper alternative (at least I assume 
they are cheap).

	Anyhow, I have lots of practice w/skipping the bar, so if 
you think you might end up skipping it, let me know, I have 
lots of tips I can give you. hehe  Make sure you know their 
current policy on skipping it too, they've changed it 
several times over the years.  Notice requirements, what a 
'no-show' counts as, that sort of thing.

	And again, good luck!  If you end up practicing and need a 
legal researcher, I'm your man.  I've always been a bookworm 
and enjoy it.  =>  I've helped practicing lawyers come up 
w/winning arguments a number of times when they were up 
against a wall and couldn't see a way out.  I'm like wolfman 
from pulp fiction, I come in and fix things when they are 
FUBAR. hehe.
