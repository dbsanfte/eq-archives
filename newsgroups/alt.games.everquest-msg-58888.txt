Heh, what date is it today, we must have reached the 3000th of september
by now, right?

(Thinks for a while... Math is HARD!)

Hey, if my calculations are correct (and more often than not, they're
wrong, so take this with a grain of salt) the 3000th of september
should be on Sunday! Cool!

If anyone is wondering about what Gary and I are talking about, do
a search on the September that never ended on the net. In the olden
days, before I started using the net, everyone feared the coming of
september, because it meant an influx of college freshmen with no
clue about .netiquette. September of 93 became known as the September
that never ended when a major online service (C$?) started its Usenet
gateway, IIRC. I still wasn't online then either, so I might have
some facts wrong...
