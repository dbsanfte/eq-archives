Posted on the beta forums tonight:
===========================

On behalf of the entire EverQuest II team, I want to thank everyone who has 
participated in our beta test over the last several months on the English, 
French, and German-language servers. Your feedback has been immeasurably 
valuable throughout the testing process by helping us find bugs and polish 
our gameplay. EverQuest II wouldn't be what it is today without your 
involvement.

We're very excited that EverQuest II will be launching on November 8. In 
preparation for the release of the game, our beta test will be concluding 
Saturday, November 6. At noon PST, we will be shutting down the beta servers 
and deleting all characters and items. Our official forums will be 
temporarily closing at the same time so that we can restructure the boards 
and be ready for a fresh start when the game goes live.

EverQuest II will begin shipping to retailers in the US on Monday, November 
8, with dozens of servers awaiting the arrival of thousands of players into 
a brand new world. The European versions of EverQuest II will begin shipping 
across Europe on November 11, with French and German-language servers ready 
for play. At launch, all our subscribers will have access to the core 
features of our new Station Players website which allows you to track the 
progress of your characters, build a guild website and message board, and 
interact with other members of the EverQuest II community.

We hope you enjoy your last hours in the EverQuest II beta. Though the 
testing process has come to an end, your adventure in Norrath has only just 
begun.
