Warriors were more concerned with nerfing monks, than fixing the real
problems and inbalances

Furor got into a monk bashing frenzy which the usual sheep picked up on, and
the whole focus was on how close monks were to warriors tankability, not the
fact all that extra AC is worthless, or the fact taunt is a pile of shit, or
the fact knights can do 99% of what an exp group warrior can do, but do it
better. No, forget all that, they just wanted monks nerfed.
