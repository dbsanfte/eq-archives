The answer to question 1 is that West Karana has been infected with the
plague by the minions of Bertoxxulous.  The messages you see have to do with
that.

With regards to other places to hunt as a 19th level Druid, you might try
the tower in Crushbone with some of the named NPCs there. You can also check
out the Estate of Unrest. Might want to group with others in both places.
And, of course, you  need to go to the Lake of Ill Omens where you can level
from 19 to 30 without leaving.

Good Hunting,

Duladan Bloodmoon (33 rd ranger) Morrel Thule
Tollas (16th druid) - Morrel Thule
Barouk (10th Pally) - Druzzil Ro
