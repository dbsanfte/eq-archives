    As someone who's played a monk to 40, let me respond. Nuh-uh. The LAST
thing a Feigned monk wants is for you to start fighting what they were
fighting, because now they have no chance at getting a lucky Mend cycle and
finishing a wounded mob. Most of the time when they feign something off,
it's because they think they're in over their heads. As for being beside
your group, odds are it was something as simple as "this is the best place
to pull to", and you're both doing it.

    Example: giant fort, Frontier Mountains. My monk pulls to the inside
wall, same side as the entry, same as other groups. If a second group sets
up on that wall, I'll put myself between the entrance and them so the
wanderer doesn't add on me during a fight. If I get someone's train on me
when I'm fighting, I WILL feign to save myself - and the giants will wander
onto the next group along the wall. And if they're fighting something, then
yes, when I feign the other group will more often than not get aggro
immediately. It isn't malicious on my part - if I wanted to train I'd bring
every Craig and Brae out of the mines and dump them all over the place. It's
just how the pathing works.
