Did any of them know you very well?  If I'm with friends, I'll let 
something go that I know they need.  Otherwise, how do I know that 
expensive item won't end up on the player's mule tomorrow?  How did any 
of those people know you *actually* needed the item?  I've seen people 
(who *were* friends, till I saw them pulling this kind of BS) sell Vox 
and Naggy items in the bazaar so they can "have a chance at rolling for 
the item again tomorrow when he/she pops".  I've heard of people who 
will claim "NBG" on items daily, putting the spares on their mules.  It 
sucks, but there are way too many dishonest and opportunistic people in 
the game to *ever* do NBG in a pickup group (unless you start the group 
of course)
