I was wondering if anyone had made a program where you could punch up
a weapon or mobs info on a PDA (like a Palm or Windows CE) so you
don't have to leave EQ to get the info you need. I would think that
would be a goldmine, but very hard to set up due to the massive amount
of items to keep track of.

Anyone know of such a program? I'm looking for Palm personally as I
have a Palm M130.

Thanks!
