Sure.  It's not a 1 to 1 thing.

These numbers are totally bogus but you get my meaning, I hope.

At level 20 you need 1000 xp points to level.  The average critter gives you
10 xp points, so it takes 100 critters to get the level.

At level 25 you need to get 5000 xp points to level, but the average critter
only gives 25 xp points, so you need *200* to level.

AGAIN, THE NUMBERS ARE TOTALLY BOGUS, but that's the basic situation.
