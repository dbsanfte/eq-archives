That would make it clearer.

Hmm. But the grouping 101 bit mentions the jobs each character class
does, but not the process of each job. I read it and I still have no
idea how to do any of it.

Hmm. I have plenty of room on my web site... I have been thinking
about using screen dumps, converted to png files, to show some of
the things I find out.

Has anyone done this with the faq ? It doesn't have to be super
detailed. Captioned screen dumps to show examples would work.

But it would make it easier to learn. Word descriptions can be made
verbose enough to describe exactly what to do, but they can also
become so verbose it bogs down in information overload.

I did notice this past weekend, one web site showing how to use the
elevator in Kelethin, along with various druid places there. They
used captioned screen dumps, with circles and lines added to show
the locations on the platform to activate the elevator, as an
example.

okay, so I've done a pull in the tutorial using the throw stone
skill, but didn't know it was called pulling. Either the tutorial or
the faq should mention that.

I usually use the f9 key when I have my toons travelling around some
where, to make sure something hasn't suddenly taken an interest in
my toon. Or when I am in heavy combat to check if other creaturesare
about to join in attacking my 'toon. Saved the character a few
times.

I really dislike the overhead view, it should go up higher. Right
now, it makes it far too easy for other monsters to arrive and start
attacking without the player realizing it.
