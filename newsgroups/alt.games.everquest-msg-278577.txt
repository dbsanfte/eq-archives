Hi Robert.

I've played most MMORPGs I've not however played FFXI but from what
you say then EQ2 is not for you. I have played EQ2 quite a bit.  EQ2
may let you solo somewhat but you will not get to explore much.

If you want to explore freely and don't mind slightly older games then
try the original EQ or Dark Age of Camelot. Both of these games will
let you explore huge worlds although you may have great difficulty
surviving in dangerous zones at low levels but it can be done. They
can be soled in but not readily so and it is very class dependant.
Some classes, like a Hunter in Dark Age of Camelot that has
specialised in beast mastery is a solo machine PvE as is the
Necromancer in both games. Other classes can solo well also but some
cannot solo well at all.

If you want a game that will let you do both things, explore and solo
well then World of Warcraft is the way to go. A very big world to
explore freely and also by far the better game for a solo inclined
player than EQ2 is. 

You can solo easily enough in WoW until around level 40 or so, some
classes slightly better than others though, but all can solo well
enough. You will have difficulty soloing in dungeons, on elite quests
and also have trouble in contested areas on a PvP server. If you don't
like PvP then choose a 'normal' or 'Role Play' server in WoW.

Hope this helps a little but no doubt someone will disagree with me
;).

BB.
