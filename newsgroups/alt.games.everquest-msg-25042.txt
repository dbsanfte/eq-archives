Exactly. You advised him to sink 3k into JC. That's 3k wasted. 10k is
about what you need to spend to make money at it; and it's just not
worth it in the long run on any but the newest servers.

Uh, well, he was asking how to *twink* an enchanter with 7k. Silly or
not, that's what *he* wants to do, not lose 3k in a tradeskill.

Whatever. I would give the same advice to any starting enchanter:
whether you plan on twinking up front or earning it all yourself, go for
max int and cha, period. By the time you have to start worrying about
anything else, you should know what it is you need (hp, mana, ac,
resists, whatever). Jewelcraft is a waste of money for regular players,
until you have everything else you need and just have extra cash in the
bank.
