Do not get a flatscreen unless you really want one. If you're looking
for something that works fine and will display everything you need it
to just get a regular 14 or 17inch monitor. Buying flatscreen monitors
just adds a bunch of $ to the price and that's about it. I've seen
tons of flatscreens and none of them appear better than any regular
monitor I've used. Though it doesn't look like you're worried about
price there but anyway regular monitors display EQ fine, I've never
seen any proof that flatscreens do anything better than a regular
monitor except take up a bit less space.
