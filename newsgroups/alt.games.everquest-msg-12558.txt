I guess it's most for the fun of the challenge, and i now that �#�#�#%
Holly Windstalker, she has slain my human necro a few times, and there
has been others as well, Phaeril Nightshire for one.

I am lvl 9 now but i don't have all the spells, they are very
expensive, and i shure wonder how a lvl 1 can have 2pp to
offer for some bone chips.

The ward undead is that a good spell? i don't feel like buying a
useless spell for 5pp, is the lesser shielding any good? well for the
5pp it costs :(

/Regards Berth
