If the UN had ten years ago given support for military action in Iraq, 
forevermore and for any reason, I'm sure George W. Bush wouldn't have 
bothered with trying to drum support for a second resolution, as the 
first one would have been deemed to give enough mandate, and it was 
clear from the beginning that it would be a struggle to get a second one 
passed.

While I don't particularly oppose the war (as I feel that it will 
probably benefit Iraq in the medium to long term), I don't think we're 
seeing a whole lot of integrity, honesty or truth as pertains the actual 
motivations for the invasion. If the US has convincing intelligence 
regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, all they would need to do 
is to actually *show* it, and the world would rally behind them. So far, 
the only "evidence" put forward turned out to be rather crudely forged 
documents... I'm sure the CIA can do better (better intelligence, or 
better forgeries, either will do).

Now, don't get me wrong, while I think that the US and Britain's motives 
for pushing for war have everything to do with oil, I also think that 
France and Russia's motives for opposing it *also* have everything to do 
with their own oil deals with Iraq.

Having said that, if after the war the US occupation administration 
honours the previous regime's oil agreements with Russia's Gazprom, 
rather than declaring them invalid and renegotiate them to benefit 
American and British oil companies, I will happily concede I was wrong 
about the real motives for the invasion. Whatever my opinions, I'm not 
anti-American by any stretch of the imagination. I lived there for five 
years, loved it, and I'd live there again if given half the chance. It's 
just that, as Donald Sutherland put it in Oliver Stone's JFK, I'm "a 
sucker for the truth".
