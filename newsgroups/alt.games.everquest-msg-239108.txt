Subject: Using cleric's root / atone for crowd control?

I was in a LDON tonight with a wizard/necro/paladin/rogue and a mage.  If we
got an add I would root it then atone it then the pets would offtank it.  The
necro would snare it.  I never got agro this way.  
Is this the logical way to handle that situation or does anyone have any other
ideas, given the group that we had?
