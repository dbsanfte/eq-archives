I have seen this game in the stores and thought i wouls check out the
newsgroup to see if it was worth getting. There seems to be a lot of
interest judging by the number ofpostings. I used to do a lot of RPG
gaming in high school and college but i haven't done much in the last
few years. Would this be the game to get to satisfy an old AD&D and
Palladium gamer?
