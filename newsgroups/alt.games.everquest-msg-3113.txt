<Raises his hand>

I only have a strength of 123 and I have with me the following:

-Evil Eye Bag (70% redux) - 8 slots

-Large Tailoring Kit (because I am a tailor) - 8 slots

-Fletching Kit (because I am a fletcher) - 8 slots

-Bearskin Potion Bag (admittedly because it made a nice lightweight 10
slot "quiver") - 10 slots

-Tailored Backpacks - 3 of them - (10% redux) - 30 slots

-Normal Backpack - 8 slots

That is 72 slots and it is not uncommon for me to have everything
filled if I am hunting.  When I run out of room it is time to stop
hunting and go see my merchant.

And yes, I am almost always encumbered.  And yes I accept the
penalties just like I accepted the risk of hitting combine on items I
wanted to sell or keep if I had them in a tradeskill kit while
hunting.  Now if I know I wont need a kit for something (like the
tailoring kit in Highpass for instance, I replace it with a 10
slotter)
