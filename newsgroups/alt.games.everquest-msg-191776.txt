Aye, the fuck nuts farming BoT caused most harm. Lot of mobs are flagged
uncharmable. They could have easily fixed it so that the mobs are flagged as
such and that would have bought an end to it but left the power of CoD as a
CC tool. Even making the named in BoT proc a dispell or something. Fix
content not nerf. They tried addressing this by changing it so you couldn't
bind at zone in, unfortunately they were too stupid to realise that the
chanters were still bound there and needed a zone wide bind point wipe.

Druids, Wizards, Bards and Necros will continue to solo unabated, chanters
will be back to LFG buff whores with CC spells that cannot CC in PoP. Having
to tash a 600+ hitting quadding mob before having a chance of Bliss to land
is beyond a joke. Going to go from a revitalised fun class to play to utter
frustrating boredom.
