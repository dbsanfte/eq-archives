You may be on to something there...

How about simply adding an automatic 5 or 10% boost to hp regen, mana regen
and even haste to all members of a 6-player group?  The xp would remain the
same, only the rate of xp gathering would change.  I think that could have
incomplete groups scrambling to pick up those who are LFG, regardless of
their class (how many times have you heard "Bah, we don't need a *insert
class here*...").

Planes and high-level dungeons (Sebilis, Velketor, etc) could easily be
excluded since they seem to already be designed for full groups.

If they can already work in an xp bonus for full groups and even for some
zones, these regen bonuses shouldn't be hard to implement either, imho.
