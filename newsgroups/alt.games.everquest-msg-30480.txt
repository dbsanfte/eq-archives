The basic rules are very easy to remember.

1) Those who have the spell "Bind Affinity" (every caster that gets spells
at level 1, except bard <they get songs>) get this spell at either level 12
(INT casters) or 14 (WIS casters).  They can bind themselves ALMOST anywhere
(the exceptions are higher level and you'll undoubtedly find them out for
yourself long after you forget this post :) ).

They can bind others if, 2) If there is a town in THAT ZONE.  Freeport is a
town...you can bind anywhere.  Qeynos Hills you cannot, because the town is
NOT in that zone.  You can bind anywhere in Greater Faydark because Kelethin
is IN that zone.

Ok, besides those basics there's a few other places you can bind that aren't
quite at obvious, but ARE towns...just not player towns.

Highpass (not sure where...you may have to go to the inner zone, but I've
never found out for sure).
City of Mist (high level zone).

And 4 that make no sense whatsoever but every melee I know are thrilled they
exist:

NK somewhere near the guard tower (I don't know where)
Field of Bone by Kaesora
Frontier Mountains (I don't know the loc).
The Arena, off of Lake Rathe.

I think this answers all your questions, though there's a couple minor holes
(sorry).
