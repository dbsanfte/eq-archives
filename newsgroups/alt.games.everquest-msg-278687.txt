	Ok, suppose to get that blade of carnage you needed to win the
rolls on 15 other rare drops 12 of which were more or less useless to you?

	Now, let's add the fact that if I *don't* get the BoC I can
buy a perfectly good 1HS in the bazaar and run a few dozen DoN's to
buy augments that will make it as good as or better than that BoC,
but the poor casters are still endlessly camping for their runes...
