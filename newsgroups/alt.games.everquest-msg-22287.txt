All the new versions of EQ don't have the tutorial included any more - it
was being used as an unofficial zone viewer, to let people explore the zones
without any danger, so Verant removed it. You might be able to download it
somewhere, or get someone to email it to you. I haven't got it either...

Good luck, and have fun
