I seem to recall quite distinctly that one of the advantages promised in
the SoL expansion was a higher-bit Z-buffer (I don't remember whether 16
or 32 bit), so things like the staircasing effect seen on the rock
spires in the Desert of Ro from a distance would disappear.

Well, I haven't been to Ro since I got SoL, but I've just seen some
pretty horrible Z-buffer artifacting in Shar-Val and in Hollowshade
Moor, most particularly on the cat head over the entrance, although it's
very noticeable on many other places.

Has anybody else seen this, or there is something wrong with my graphics
set up? I have pretty much everything turned on, except that the color
depth is set to 16 bit in eqclient.ini. I did change this to 32 for the
hell of it, but it degraded performance noticeably, and caused some
strange clipping problems too.

I have a 1.2 Ghz Athlon, GeForce 3 and 512Mb of DDR RAM, and I run EQ at
1024x768, with most options on. Framerates range from excellent in the
old world to abysmal in places like Shar Val or Shadowhaven.
