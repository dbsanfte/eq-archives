Ok I forgot if this is an ok thing to ask here, but after searching the
collective websites i have bookmarked, and checking with my guildmates and
friends, I am unable to come up with any input at all on the value of some
spells I received in my recent adventuring. Sorry if this is out of line -
if so let me know, please.

The Spells are:

Cannibalize IV (58 Shaman Spell)
Arch Lich (60 Necromancer Spell)

Only two..

I play on the Fennin Ro server as indicated in my subject line. The spells
are both drop only from what I have gleaned off Castersrealm.
I am not looking to make a fortune, I just dont want to rip anyone off -
I've got a pretty good vendor reputation and I would like to keep it that
way.
Thanks for the input and Hanrahan if you read this grats on 51!!
