OK, you don't like them as bad graphics, I can understand that.  But
if you don't like the idea of more different graphics of whatever sort
to help sort out at a glance... well I can't get my head around not
liking that.

I have to admit I'm still annoyed by that.  OK, so in the long run more
spells per page is going to be better... but I have a -lot- of spells even
when you ignore the back-of-the-book-I'll-never-cast-that-again area,
and resorting them to make sense with the new format is going to be
a massive project.  Druid alt, Bard alt... they are even worse off, since
they are even less likely to see me spending the time to figure out a new
layout.  Those layouts grew as my book filled up, I replaced spells with
new versions usually, sometimes had to swap things around to accomodate
new strategies or new spell lines... what a pain to have to reinvent it all!
If they had just left each page with its current contents and added the new
spells per page as blanks, I'd have a lot easier time dealing until such
point as I'm inspired to swap all that stuff around.

SoW, rings, and circles before level 5?  Wow, you got access to
some uber classI'm not aware of?

No, snare and sow are literally identicle in visual appearance, and
one of the most popular reasons most of my druid acquaintances
give for needing a rez would be having snared themselves meaning
to refresh sow.

While my druid is, and has never been, no more than a PL'd alt
that provides taxi service for my friends, he's also made that
mistake, and the ring/circle one, often enough to know that
different pictures would help.  In this case, the spells in the book
are different in appearance, but memmed they look the same, IIRC...
while now self ports (and Gate) look one way, group ports another.

As a cleric, I now have 4 buff lines; HP buff, AC buff, Symbol, and
self HP/AC buff, each visibly different from the others.  I can see
at a glance which lines I have running at the moment, and when
mass buffing I can also see easily which spell is memmed in which
slot.
