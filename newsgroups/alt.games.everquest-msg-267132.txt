If we're going to label threads they should all be lableled, I think. If 
EQ2 dies out, we can stop labelling what's left eq1. If eq1 dies out we 
can stop labelling eq2... and if they both persist, we'll need it, 
unless or until they're split into separate groups.

CoH and SWG may be flashes in the pan -here-... but EQ2 is a different 
breed... we should expect to see eq2 posts be on topic here until they 
are given a new home. CoH and SWG chatter was tolerated in deference to 
the regulars who wanted to share their discussion with the regulars. We 
are a community of sorts after all, and we don't always have to talk 
about eq ... some of us are people ;)

Also, CoH and SWG never really posed a threat to the existence of EQ, 
EQ2 does. From a business perspective, from a marketing perspective, and 
from a genre perspective. All indications that EQ2 is the game for 
casuals and groupers who don't want to have to raid are dubious at 
best... and SOE would much rather support one game than 2 games; and 
clearly they'd prefer eq2: its a newer more modern codebase, without 5 
years of dubious design decisions, and without a rigidly stratified and 
close minded (with respect to what the EQ1 experience -should be-) 
playerbase to contend with. so its much easier on them to support eq2; 
the fact that they've jacked the subscription rate another 15% is just 
gravy on top.

If they can shoehorn enough of us into EQ2 to make it more profitable 
than running EQ2 beside EQ1 they -will-. So we can speculate that EQ2 is 
a flash in the pan, be we ought take it more seriously. SOE isn't going 
to be bolstering EQ agianst the 'threat of EQ2'. SOE isn't merely going 
to let EQ bleed players to EQ2, its going to assist the process as much 
as they can get away with, and probably more.

How long before we start getting newsletters 'allowing' us to transfer 
the remainder of our subscription onto our newly purchased EQ2 box? or 
tack a free month onto EQ2 to EQ1 players to reward us for our 
'loyalty'... perhaps a year from now they'll sell us the EQ2 dvd for 10 
bucks...hell they might even let us download it.

They don't need us right now, they've got their handsful with the newbs 
and eq2 enthusiats, but they want the eq1 crowd eventually... they're 
just going to make sure they get everyone who's willing to pay top 
dollar to make the transition -first-.
