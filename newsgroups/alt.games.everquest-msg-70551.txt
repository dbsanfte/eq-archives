OMFG! - LOL -

What a pathetic sounding whine!  After reading this I am wondering WTF! is
this guy doing playing a "TIME SINK" game like Everquest while in such dire
financial circumstances....Geezus.

An image comes to mind.   Democrats trying to force through legislation to
provide Government support for those low-income folks who are struggling to
play EQ.!!  "It is a basic civil right"! will be the campaign cry.  Maybe we
could have free EQ "soup kitchens" for the wandering masses.  Or maybe put
EQ in the libraries...save on book cost too.

Seriously, if you have *any* struggles in real-life because of EQ, then you
better "GET OUT FAST" because you have some major addiction or other
problems.
