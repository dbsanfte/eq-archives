Kill large bats and giant bats on the hill to the left once you go through
the wall.
You can make the quick run back to the guards if things get hairy.  Really
quite a
good place to level to about 7 or 8 max.

From there go through Kithcor forest to WC then to EC.  Make sure you turn
left out of rivervale into kithcor and hug the zone wall.  Go during the day
as well just to be sure.  You should be fine.  If you find a decent group in
misty thicket you might consider staying till 9 to get your new spells in
rivervale.  If you've learned how to use harmony and snare effectively then
taking the orcs in misty thicket by yourself is no problem.

I was is EC fighting orcs till about 11 then WC at the derv camp till about
14 then you can pretty much go anywhere you want because now you got SoW on
demand.  Once I hit 14 I traveled pretty much everywhere.

Right now I'm 16 in Oasis.  The orc groups there seem ok but I'll probably
be heading to LOIO anytime now.
