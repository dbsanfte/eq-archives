Heh, you seem to take umbrage at my monk insult.  I'm referring to one in
particular that broke spawns up just enough that he could kill about 10 or
12 before repops, and he could just run in a big circle killing as he went,
which left about 5 wyverns for everybody else to fight over since he would
be standing at the spawn point to engage 'his' spawns.

Monks aren't the only morons in CS though, there was an SK (ogre) who felt
the need to fear a wyvern in my quad so he could fear kite it, which brough
the wrath of WyvernWyvernWyvernWyvern down upon him.  The resultant corpse
was quite ravaged (one wyvern in particular seemed to have an affinity for
the SK's eye socket)
