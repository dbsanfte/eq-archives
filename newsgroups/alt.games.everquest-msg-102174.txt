Yes, we know what's meant by pre-nerf. What we're saying is that none
of us have ever seen or know anyone who has ever seen a LORE Centi LS.
Also, no one has ever accepted offers of ridiculous amounts of pp to
just SEE a LORE Centi LS. I heard of someone offering 5K just to look
at one. Gotta admit, even if the guy offering doesn't pay, that's
worth the gamble. The person showing would lose nothing...
