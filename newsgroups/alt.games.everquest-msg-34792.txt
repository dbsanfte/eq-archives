Everfrost is where I zipped thru 30.  With SOW, Fear Animal, and Track you
can solo thru 30 killing wooly mammoths.   You can kill about 10 to 15
before you even have to sit down and rest.  Got thru level 30 in 6 hours
solo.  As a bonus mammoths tusks sell for 10pp, just bring along a LARGE
sewing kit to put them in.
