I've never used everlogs, so I can't give you a fair comparison.  However,
I will recommend you get the log file parser from http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/
It was written and is maintained by one of our own here in the news group.

I can't imagine ever wanting to try another log parser. This thing calculates just
about anything you would want to know.  Since Joe D is a regular and contributing
member here, there is a certain amount of trust and also great feedback.
