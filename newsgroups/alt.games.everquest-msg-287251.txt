Sadly, about the only way to play a bard anymore is as a bot. They
just don't offer enough at the higher end to justify the small
increase in effectiveness one gets from playing them straight up. If
they melee'd better or could grab and hold aggro better, maybe, but
when they're relegated to sitting back and beating on their drum, they
may as well be botted.

Before anyone jumps up and screams, "if you're just sitting back
beating on your drum, then you're a crappy bard", just let me say that
I am quite aware of what a bard can bring to the table. The problem
is, with the itemization, available buffs and mob/encounter design of
today's EQ, those benefits a bard can provide have just been pushed
too close to the point of being trivial. I've seen some great bards to
some pretty incredible things, but at this point when other classes
can do those things as well (or better) *in addition to* making
significant contributions to total DPS...well...the bard is just best
botted.

Someone at SoE must have decided that since bards had enjoyed so much
time as "soloing gods" in the past (which was a poor design decision),
they should be relegated to bottom feeders now (an even more stupid
design decision).
