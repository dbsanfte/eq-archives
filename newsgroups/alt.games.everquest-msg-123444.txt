DL speed isn't really a way to judge the stability of your connection.
It doesn't require as stable a data rate as online gaming does. You
may well find the same problem with other online games... One thing,
if you're using a winmodem (PCI connection, I beleive), junk it for a
real one. Winmodems are horrible about connection stability.

'course, best advice is to upgrade to cable modem. *grin* But, not
everyone can do that.

Yup. Has been doing that since early December/late November. Since the
loading bar appeared there. Just a bit of humor from VI.
