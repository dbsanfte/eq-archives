It took us a long time to find him because we kept running past him as we
combed QHills.  He's sitting or sleeping on top of a hill, and it's almost
impossible to see him from a distance.

He's just a bit north of the zoneline from Qeynos, and west of the road on top
of a hill under a tree.

It uses the DoN mission system, so maybe.  Everyone we took had DoN, so I
don't know whether it's required.
