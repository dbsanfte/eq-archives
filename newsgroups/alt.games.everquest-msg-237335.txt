That dodges the test. I'm not asking him to convince me he did it, I'm
asking him to do it. That's why i restrict the paradox *strictly* to
p-logic; the rules are strict and complete. As soon as a god is
allowed to 'pass the test' outside the p-logic box then he can
"cheat". Part of the test stipulation is that the *only* thing he is
allowed to do is deliver the formal proof working within the rules of
p-logic.

This isn't some genie wish thing. Its a very simple test, and an
omnipotent god wouldn't need to bend the interpretation of the task
being asked. He should simply be able to do it in the staightforward
manner asked of him.
