I don't know.  Bill Gates is everyone's favorite person to hate (even though
he may be the most generous philanthropist alive).  But I suspect he knows
what he is buying is talent -- a known winner's talent.  I think it's a
little bit funny, actually.  McQuaide and company leave Sony, and I'll bet
many there thought he would fade into online gaming history.  Now he'll be
bankrolled by one of the few companies on Earth that can out-muscle Sony.
As long as Microsoft doesn't try and take any of Sigil's creative freedom
away, I think it will work out nicely.
