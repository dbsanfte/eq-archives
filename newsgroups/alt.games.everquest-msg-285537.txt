Actually, this is a noticeable improvement, but only because things
were screwy for a while.  When TSS came out, many items were changed
so they stack to 100.  The items that got changed were the ones used
as components for spells, hence bone chips, bat wings, and various
gems (e.g. opals for the "stop the rain" spell, other gems for rune
shields, and many that are used in the "imbue gem" line of spell).
As a result, folks buying these items began having exactly the sort
of problem you describe: intending to buy 20 but getting 100 by
mistake.  Now, that's the sort of thing you can get used to, but
with gems it was a mess, because not all gems are used in spells.
So people buying gems for tradeskills had to remember which gems now
stacked to 100 and which to 20.  (Or you could buy one stack without
holding the shift key, see how high it stacks, and then decide how
many stacks you needed.)

At least now all of the gems behave the same way!

p.s.: And if you have good enough charisma and/or faction, those bat
wings will sell back for the same price you paid.  On the high end
gems the margin becomes more of an issue. :-)
