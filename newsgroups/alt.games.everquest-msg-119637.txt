I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one who does this.  I just have this
terrible fear that the ONE item I leave on a corpse is going the be the
single most rare drop in the game for the SUPER UBEREST item of all time.
Ok, that being said, I tried to go cold turkey this weekend and I left a Gem
of Nimbleness on a Drolvarg corpse.  Within minutes there were a number of
ooc's in the zone wanting to loot one.  DANG! I knew it!!!  I was there a
couple of more hours and a second one never dropped.
