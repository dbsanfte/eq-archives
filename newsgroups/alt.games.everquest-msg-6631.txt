I'd think this would be helpful to the five or six PvPers out there.  OK,
make that 5K or 6K.  Hope it didn't take a lot of otherwise valuable
programming time to implement.

Ohhh, lovely.  When my main server is down, I like to bop
over to a PvP server to mess around... good to know that
I will now be "Care Bear" when I do until I spend enough time
to actually level up to 7th.  One more of the small pleasures of
EQ nerfed.

I had the impression that your effective skill level was reduced to
the max for your current level if you de-leveled.  Apparantly this
was incorrect, you used to retain your full skill, and now you will
at most retain your full skill plus 10.  At low levels even a plus ten
skill would be pretty large.  SO the ideal lowbie stomper is now
a level 13 deleveled to 11th... able to attack 7s with the skill of
a 13.  On the other hand, without the massed pool of "people from
my  server that is now down" level 1s to hunt, what's the point?  Have
to be a ranger in order to find level appropriate prey!

Oh joy, now instead of whacking a few coldain heads in order to get to
quest level, we'll see people haveing to clean all of thurgadin as often as
you'll see trolls cleaning out High Pass.  Oh well, most people seem to
be ignoring these quests already.

Does it fix that too?

Astonishing... Quivers suddenly become useful items after only what, two years?
And yet another improve to that oft overlooked archery skill... its not just for

Keep fixing the annoying little bugs like this, and some day you'll be ready
to take the game out of beta.

Help, my hammer has expanded, and now I can't get it out of my jeweler kit!

From a tactical standpoint, how useful is the "push" ability?  I guess
it would save some time in getting a raid somewhere, as you won't
need to keep gating back to pick up the next group.  But if the
wizard was included as before, he'd be able to simply click "refuse"
to not go along, instead of the nuisance of having to seperately
mem gate to get going.

Good, they have been annoyingly hard to get... and I'm just coming up
on level 39 where I'll want mine, too.

HOw lovely.  Now when I get killed by a game glitch, and get a res,
I won't have to wait the two minutes for the effects to wear off...
too bad I'll still have to wait the half hour plus for them to show up
in the first place!

What?  You mean they will actually let me escape from a nasty mob,
instead of just giving me 18 seconds to stand there, unable to move
since the mob is still stunning the Hecate out of me?

Don't fix the exploit, no, instead remove the spell that's letting em do it.
Frankly, as unusable as eye of zomm generally is, it was nice to hear that
-someone- figured out something for it.  Course I didn't hear till after it
was nerfed, and -still- have no idea what the use was.  Was this a nerf
or an emergency fix, anyone know what the exploit was?

And this was a problem because?  I mean, its just a joke, and the only person
who could be hurt by it would be the joker, as party (or raid) members
might refuse to believe he'd faked the message.

THis is helpful, I've been known to loot things like a Tizmak Surcoat
or Drakkal Icegrinder without even knowing it, since they look just like
the usual Tizmak Tunic or Drakkal Sledgehammer.

This is a plus, I hate going thru and deleting peoples names because I
haven't had contact with them in a while and need the space.  Too bad 30
isn't nearly enough, given that some of my friends have multiple characters,
and thus may take up three or four spaces each if I really want to know
whether they (the player) are on.

Hmm, frankly, not a plus for me... my friends are my friends, not
my characters friends.  I'll want the same friends list for each
character, now I'll have to maintain that by either in game adding them
to each list, or out of game duping up the list to all characters.

On the other hand, it will be nice having different "friends" lists on
seperate servers, I have a lot of old buddies from Luclin that have
been cut from my list because I primarily play on Morel Thule, and
just don't have room on my little list currently.

I don't recall this ever happening before, didn't even know it was
possible.

This sucks, I liked being able to sell off the entire contents of a pack by
clicking sell eight times.  It isn't as though you actually mass sold the items
anyway, you had to forcibly sell one by one... up to eight times plus the
container to completely empty a backpack space, if by any chance you
really wanted to.

Fun, now we'll be able to waste still more time chain killing the same
mobs or doing the same mind numbing quest in order to get faction still
higher.  Its faction questing that puts the "ever" in Everquest anyway!
