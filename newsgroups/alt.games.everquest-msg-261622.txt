Apparently not. :)

I'm actually a little surprised. I'm not sure I follow the logic of why 
more fps gets you more lev distance. I'd think it would be the 
opposite... if there is a static vertical adjustment each frame then 
less fps would be better... if its vertical adjustment per unit time ... 
then fps shouldn't matter... out of curiosity what *is* happening? I may 
need it one day... and my brother has a much weaker system than me... so 
he might benefit from it greatly... if he doesn't already know :)

Quite frankly I've never had any trouble getting where i need to go with 
lev, so I've sort of ignored the various lev tips. (e.g. I can clear 
Karnors without goofing with my clipping plane....or cpu overclocking)

My understanding of faction is somewhat haphazard; as there is a lot of 
contradictory info out there, but it is my understanding that barring 
special circumstances you can only earn +/- 2000 faction hits to any 
faction. The least faction adjustment you can receive is +/- 1. 

Therefore... killing 2000 goblins should give you the maximum boost you 
can achieve for that faction. So killing  2,000 goblins in say WW, at 
the fort, at least 50 per hour... would be 40 hours (I think 50 per hour 
is low... it might be as high as 100 per hour if you clear them as they 
pop... definately a lot of effort... maybe even weeks depending on your 
schedule... possibly months if you are too low to clear the fort.
