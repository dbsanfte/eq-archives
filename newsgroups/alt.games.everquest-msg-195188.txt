While these figures are well within believability, I have to ask, why on
earth would Barbarians get  a penalty?

Their stats aren't all that amazing, they are night blind as humans and
erudites, and they are irritatingly big.  Only benefit I can think of is that
they have Slam. That it, slam?

Ogres have slam and good stats and can't be stunned from the front, so thats
15%, and Regen is 20% on both Iksar and Trolls?

Still can't think what sucks badly enough about halflings to give them 5%
bonus.  Oh and Warriors get a bonus too, as I understand it, so halfling
warriors really rocket up in levels compared to Barb Rogues?
