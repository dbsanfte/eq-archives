I do, but I just came back after a long break from EQ.  Rerolled a
Shadowknight.  Haven't seen alot of PvP there personally, but I hear about
it (only level 8 on my new char).  The people who play seem to be staying
and having a good time.  Yes, however, there are alot less people then there
were when it launched back in.....    ??
