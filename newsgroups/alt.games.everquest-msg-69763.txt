  But you can't just dismiss all of the levels before 45 in
discussions of balance.  Levels 1-45 are just as much a part of the
game as 46+ levels are.

  In the case of necromancers, there might be mobs you can kill for
the component.

  I mean to escape if you get in trouble during your CR.  If a melee
gets in trouble, there's a good chance it means another death.

  From some of the accounts I've read on this board, the spells do
have a lot of use in some situations for CRs.

  No, but most of the melee classes can't performance a safe CR in
"every situation" either.  In fact, none of them can.  Sometimes you
need the help of a group or a rezz.  A melee class might have to run
through several dangerous areas, a caster only has to probably move
through one or two.

  Perhaps so.

  That's because it is.

  A side effect?  It is a major component of the spell.  You can't
just dismiss this side effect as if it doesn't exist in discussions of
balance.

  And a melee class has NO means by which to exit an area that they
can't cross safely.

  Yeah, but how many level 15 mobs out there will aggro on a level 50+
character?  And among those, how many of those see invisibility?  VERY
few.

The

  Eh, I suppose I see your point.  So death has nothing to do with at
all, it's just a way of giving casters an advantage when travelling.
Still, the way I see it, melee classes can't Gate so they casters
would still have their "travelling advantage" even if melee classes
could get bound anywhere, since they don't have Gate.
