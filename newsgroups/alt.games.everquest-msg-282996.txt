thanks to everyone who's been helping me, and anyone who contributed to the 
recent thread about mutliboxing ...

i am using lavasoft's winEQ and successfully running up to 5 accounts (with 
max settings, no less!) ... it's great, but i think 3 is the magic number 
(and i like to leave the other bots in group to leech xp and toss a buff 
every 10 minutes ... like regular eq, but with no one to talk to in /g =P )


anyway...

i'm noticing some xp issues ... it might be that they were always there, but 
hotzone xp-acceleration magnified it ... but i suspect it's just that i've 
never leveled a handful of toons at the same exact time, and thusly been in 
a position to notice ... although it is possible some patch changed things 
during the 1.5 years i was gone ...

i have toons of levels 47, 48, 51, 54, 55, and 56

that SHOULD be a good group - and functionally, it's fantastic...the 55 is a 
druid, and i'm seriously hoping the dps picks up .. i'll probably be 
dropping the druid out of group and putting a rogue in place ... but the 
thing is, it's *not* a fantastic group ... the xp is pretty sour on the 
lowest toons

and it doesn't seem to matter where i hunt, but xp was best in gunthak (mobs 
were high 30's at the shanty town) and worst in PoJ / velks / old sebilis 
(mobs were probably 43-47)

so what gives? when the 54+ toons are out of group, xp is a lot better ... 
and when i shroud them down to 50, it's also better

and i realize that 1 person playing all those characters has to be slower 
than each account receiving full attention, but to compensate, i use a 70-pt 
DS setup on the tank and "parallel process" with 3-5 mob pulls ... but i 
don't think xp is slower because my full group isn't a real full group 
(killing faster, etc etc)


i'm assuming you all know that shrouds are pretty weak ... so keeping the 
toons shrouded to stay within 5 lvls of each other is really not a great 
option...

i'm planning on pl'ing the bottom up a little bit, then hoping xp spreads 
more evenly ... but come on, pl? that's not a good answer, and i would 
probably put the other toons in, shrouded, leeching, anyway...

i guess what i need to know is ... would fighting higher lvl mobs give more 
xp to the bottoms, or would it stay proportionate? is that a stupid 
question? what am i missing?

when all toons are within a few levels of each other, is it generally better 
to plow through mobs of equal/lower level, or to struggle with fewer higher 
lvl mobs? i seem to remember something about the latter being preferred, but 
is it still that way? does it depend on the level range (as in, that only 
applies to 55+ ?)



thanks,
