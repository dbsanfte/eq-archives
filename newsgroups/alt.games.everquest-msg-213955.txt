is quite good too, as well as a host of others.

Theres a lot of class-related websites and forums around for all that 
special knowledge :-)

As for which race / class to begin with - It doesnt matter at first, you'll 
get around a few combinations before you settle with those that you like to 
play most.

Stay away from the most difficult combos at first though - get to know the 
do's and don'ts first.

Happy hunting - Hope youll enjoy the game !
