It just occurred to me that a possible explanation for the instanced
zone is to test whether providing a dynamically configured instanced
zone that provides dark blue mobs to solo players or a group to xp on
would be worthwhile.

That high-level players (>51 or so) and groups cannot (or have a truly
hard time coping) with the dark blue (and social) mobs could be an
indication that the upper end wasn't tuned to be playable above a
certain level or, alternatively, that this kind of instanced
expedition is not intended for xping through the high-end of the game.
In other words, if you are >51 (or whatever) you should be going
through the existing content because you have reached a point where it
is now doable.

Obviously, this is not a fully implemented aspect, but might be a
portend of something to be an option for sub 50 players.

In my opinion.
