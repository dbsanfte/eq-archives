It's been mentioned from time to time.  It would work somewhat, but not
nearly as well as those who suggest it seem to think.

See, thats the problem... everyone suggesting it assumes a best case
scenario result every time.  You're assuming perfect aggro control from a
group of warriors.  It just doesn't work that way in "real life."    One
warrior will get more aggro because he outdamages the others, or has better
weapons, or positioning is a little off and he's a bit closer to it.   Taunt
will fail at times.  Never will you end a fight with all 6 down the same
amount of health.    You're also suggesting starting at 50 percent life, so
they can bandage to reduce downtime.  That brings low health aggro into the
picture... if one of them gets too low, the mob will stick to them like glue
no matter what the others are doing to it.  Until the mob dies, or that
person dies.

6 of any class can "take reasonable XP mobs and do so with little downtime."
(With the exception of level 65's in PoP.)   6 warriors could probably
survive as a group, but would they be doing anywhere near as well as 6 of
any other class?

6 rogues would do better.  Since only one person is taking damage, and 5 are
doing damage at any one time, a class that does more damage will add more
than another tank.  The mobs would die 10 times faster, so the one rogue
tanking takes less damage than the warrior in the group of all warriors.

6 rangers, same deal as the rogues, and if your'e talking  high level then
you bring arrow kiting into the picture.    Snare it and have all 6 plink
away for more damage and much less downtime.

6 wizards?  Snare it and have 5 blast it to oblivion.

6 necros / mages...  swarm it with pets and nuke / dot it to oblivion.

6 beastlords, thats 12 people doing good melee damage to the mob, with all
the players having a bit of healing ability as well.

6 paladins / shadow knights, same as warriors only you're bringing healing /
lifetaps, fearkiting and feing death into the mix.

etc...etc... etc...

And a balanced group would blow the warriors away, of course.
