No, he wouldn't have a case, but just watch the front-page hissy fits
fly.  I saw a couple of those back when I was playing Sims - there
were a couple sites that would post front page rages about how people

disrespectful!, and did we mention it's illegal!, when you knew
perfectly well they snagged the stuff off 7deadlysims and such.
