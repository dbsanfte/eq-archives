At your level (up to say 12) you'll want to avoid fear tactics as
too expensive and unreliable.  Your pet is your biggest weapon,
but he's fragile, so you need to tank for him.  Tell him
/pet no taunt
and cast on that mob to get it on your butt instead of his.  DOT,
snare, and melee, back up if you start to take a beating and the
mob will either switch to your pet or chase you... if it chases you
the pet gets free hits, and you take nothing as its snared and can't
catch you, while if it goes to the pet you suck some hp out of it
and into you, then dive back into the fray.

I wouldn't work in the commons, if I were you, too many higher
level aggro mobs wandering around that will grab you... and
you aren't SOW'd and they aren't snared.  For a nearby zone
with similar mob levels but less danger, try N Ro.  Lots more
running around room in there, and a lot less spam to deal with
too.  Course I never take my own advice, my newbie characters
mostly do EC because they can auction off my high level
character's loot while they hunt.  Sure do die a lot, though.

Watch out with that rusty two hander approach.  If your
pet does more than half the damage to the mob, he takes
half the exp.  Since this isn't your first character, you aren't
all that concerned about loot; while using the heavily armed
pet to slice stuff up fast will drop more junk, you'll actually
get more exp if you tone him down a little, take the mobs
out slower, but are careful to take all the exp each time.
Course if you really want to see the mana fly, get a partner,
then your pet can go all out and you won't have to worry,
he has to outdamage your whole -group- to take half
the damage.  After 10, rogues are your best friends, as
they get backstab to help out with the fear approach!
