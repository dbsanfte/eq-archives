At least patches and emergency patches have 1 positive thing:

(im a lil sketchy about thursdays events, its been a hard weekend..)
The killing spree started Thursday,  firstly we went to SS so we could go
smack Lord Yelinak.  Next Klandicar needed to die, and so he did.  We then
moved to kael for statue and vindi, then ventured to VP. (I think THO got it
thursday also)

Friday though, was even better.  This time we started in kael with Derakor,
then we moved onto SS to give Yelinak another smack.  Klandicar needed to
die again, and so he did.

Next it was time to slay Dain (he did a really weird poof in the first pull,
which we have never seen before - at 15% or so HP, he warped back to his
throne room, then proceeded to summon the raid there 1 at a time and kill
them.. grrr)

Anyway Dain dropped like the good dorf that he is, and we ventured into
Luclin.  Firstly we stopped by in Akheva for The Itraer Vius, before heading
to Umbral and slaying Rumblecrush.   At this point Tormax finally popped, so
time to head over to Kael again and slay him.

We got an "unusual" add though while we were pulling Tormax's ramp....
guildie01 tells the guild, "AOW AT THE BANK!!!$%$%!"
replies... "yeah right, as if, thats not funn... oh F%CK!!!!"

I had been doing the pulling (thus evaded the severe beating AoW gave to my
unsuspecting guildies at the bank).. infact I was stood on the ramp, and got
to witness the carnage first hand.  Once he'd stepped on enough bodies to
ensure wipe-out.. he just hung around, not really doing much..  at this
point I turned (figured I'd move more into tormax ramp, just to be safe).. I
turned 180 degrees, and started to type.. to be rudely interrupted with..
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1004
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 892
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 895
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100

Aww shit.. because I was typing, I couldn't FD.. I don't know if I finished
my sentence, or if it even made any sense.. but I FD'd in time to see the
AoW stand over me, scratching his ass (guess he thought I looked so cute,
just lay there, that he decided to camp my 'corpse')

Despite repeated warnings that it was *not* safe, various people still
logged back in at the bank.. 'as you do'.. 2 attempts at training him away,
we finally moved his ass back to the arena.

It sure has to rank as the biggest "add" I've seen in a fight before, and it
was only 1 mob!

I passed out sometime surely after Tormax died, so dunno what else we
slayed.. but 4-5 St keys and lots of other loot in 2 nights is some nice
going :)  (too bad ST is now nerfed to hell)

We had our second attempt against Tunare on Saturday (first fight we won on
our first pull a few weeks back, really nice tense fight that was!).. once
again that bish dropped to her knees for us on the first try, and getting 3
Flowing thought items (2 earrings, 1 essence of nature thingy) kindof made
up for Yelinaks lame ass loot (4, yes *four* pos ranger whips from him in 2
days!)

2 guildie twinks (level 20 or so) now have Yelinak loot (talk about twinked
heh), and 2 random 50-52 rangers who were told to immediately come to
skyshrine, sure did have a worthwhile trip.

Now we get to wait a week before we can repeat the kill-fest... damn EQ
sucks! :(
