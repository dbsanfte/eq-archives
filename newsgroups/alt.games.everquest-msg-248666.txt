That wouldn't be the email address you contacted the seller from, and the 
address you had him ship the game to, now, would it? :)

I don't actually know what they ask for personally.  Haven't actually 
forgotten my password yet.  But I would be rather suprised if they asked 
for substantially more than the CD Key.
