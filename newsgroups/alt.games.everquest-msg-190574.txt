Clip plane is ok, I can see the difference in it when I set it to 0.
Usually have it at 100.

From what I seen no. It was almost totally dark, so much so I was
worried about falling into a hole or such.

My character is a half-elf, so at least I can see the monsters. It's
just everything else that is near totally dark that I don't like :) If
your lightsource actually lit up the area around you it wouldn't be so
bad, but it doesn't seem to work properly. I notice it at times you'll
be moving across an area and then one side of you will light up and
then just as quickly fade back to dark as you move over it. To me it
seems as though light sources are not working properly.

I don't think it's a setup issue as normal daytime in an outdoor area
is quite bright. Even night in an outdoor area is acceptable (as long
as it's not raining, but that's another peeve .... why is north karana
not a giant lake seeing as though it rains 20 hours out of 24 ? :) )
It just seems that indoor dungeon areas are excessively dark & that
light sources aren't lighting the place up the way they should be.
