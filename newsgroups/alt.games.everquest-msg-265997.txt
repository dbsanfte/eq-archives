Me too - what makes it odd is that they left the Goblin mastery book
on the Refugee Isle.

I hope they reinstate the Mastery books - even if they only provide a
title.  But I don't see why they couldn't provide a general bonus
against the title creature (10% extra damage, say) as htis would stack
nicely with the bonuses you get at certain levels (like an idiot, my
main character didn't choose the Gnoll bonus at level 10, or whatever
it was - meaning she found it really hard to kill Gnolls).

Oh well - one mistake I won't make in Retail...
