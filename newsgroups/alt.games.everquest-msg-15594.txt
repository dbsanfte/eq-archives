I think letting you keep your money and mundane items is a good idea.
I don't think your definition of mundane items is what they should go
by, though. Perhaps anything that isn't no drop, lore item, magic item
or anything of that sort (in other words anything that doesn't have
any kind of modifier on it). This would allow players to show up on a
server with decent enough equipment to survive, like fine steel armor
and weapons, without flooding the market with uber stuff. Of course,
my highest character is 19th level, so there may be uber stuff that is
considered mundane by my standards that I don't know about.
