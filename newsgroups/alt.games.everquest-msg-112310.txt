I'd imagine you could quit Stormhammer once you landed a spot on
Beta.  

personally, I've had so many gripes with EQ for the past month, that now
that I know there will be a new "addiction" to try, I'm tempted to quit EQ
the next time I go on a "verant hate" rant.  Give myself a year to get
away from the computer and get in shape...just so I can trash my figure
again when EQII comes out.

The trees in EQII, and the water, make me look forward to just wandering
around in that world.
