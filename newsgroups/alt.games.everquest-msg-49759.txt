Yeah I was gonna bring that up when I wrote that message, cause a few of the
people I'd asked had done that very thing. Unfortunately, I have only 150 or
so pp to my name, and that's only because I sold a magic ring given to me by
a higher lvl player to buy spells with (one difference between EQ and UO is
that folks are much friendlier!). How on earth do people manage to amass
such wealth in this game? Is it by selling magic items dropped from high lvl
creatures?
