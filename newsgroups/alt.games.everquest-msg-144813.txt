Well, personally, I've always thought the inventory view was from the 
ideal angle, and strangely, it's an angle that's very difficult to achieve 
with the panning camera.  I always feel like there must be one more camera 
panning control I'm not finding, though...  I can zoom in and out, but how 
do I pan it up or down or side to side?  My next best bet is using the 
/face command, and then I can never see my feet. :/
