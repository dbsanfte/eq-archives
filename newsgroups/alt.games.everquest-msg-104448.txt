Snare yes, if the mob is not immune and "IF" it lands. Ok that's
one thing druids can do.

Kite? In a dungeon. Are you high?
Where the hell do you raid? Crushbone?

Right. Root is resisted like crazy many mobs are immune and when
it breaks the druid is paste. Useless if you have an enchanter.

Useless with shaman and chanter slows.

Bingo! That's 2 things druids can do.

Shaman have it.

Most mob raid fights on critters leading to the boss mob last less than
30 seconds, dots are 1 min+ they will not stick on most boss mobs.

Wizards. Druids don't have lure based nukes so most are resisted
on the big mobs.

Wizards.

No one argues that. Pre-50.

Yet again the point is missed. The "power" is not in being able to
kite and solo but being useful to a raid and contributing. Only need
1 druid to snare, backup healing can be done by several classes
and none of them as well as a second cleric.

Best? After warrior cleric enchanter shaman most classes
come in far behind.
