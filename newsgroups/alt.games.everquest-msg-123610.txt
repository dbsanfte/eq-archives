I do have about 12 tanks on social keys, that I drag in to my 6 hotkey
slot on some pages as needed, but those hotkeys read
/target Richard
or whatever the MA of choice maybe.

I don't want to automatically assist the tank in question,
I want to see his HP bar more than I want to see the
HP bar of the thing he is fighting.  I go off on an assist
chain, a mob dies and suddenly I'm holding the bag?
Nope, target MA and back in business.

BUT I"m a cleric, not a melee or nuker, so I need to
know what the mobs are hitting as well as how the mobs
themselves are doing.

Chanters everywhere will shudder to hear me admit
this but I also click to target mobs a lot.  A LOT I
say.  Like chanters, I may have to do something about
mobs that the MA doesnt' have targetted.  That something
will never ever have a damage component if there is
a chanter in the group, so I wont' break a mez... but
it -does- happen

Of course by saying so out loud I've made sure no
MT chanter who reads this NG will ever group with me
