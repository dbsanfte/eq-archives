This reminded me of one of my proudest EQ moments. Long Long ago, I was
playing a 13th bard and I was in NRO at a Derv camp. We were doing fine as a
group, but one of the melee's (I forget what class... war or SK) by the name
of Sharkmeat started harassing one of the female players. She'd made the
mistake of telling us she was really a female IRL. The player kept coming on
to her and I told him to quit... he wouldn't and I couldn't boot him because
he was leader.

Finally I went over to him and told him to stop it RIGHT now. He said "or
what". That's when I disbanded myself from the group and walked 10 feet
away, then turned back to look at him. The Girl came over and stood by me,
and I invited her to group. One by one, all the players from the group came
over and I invited them. We hadn't discussed this, it just happenned.

Then, we came back over and said "get lost" to Sharkmeat.
