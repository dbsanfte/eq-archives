Wizard epic MQ is doable, you turn in your oil for the Staff of Gabstik,
then after someone else (or yourself) gives Arantir Karondor the Blue
Crystal staff off Phinigel and the Gnarled staff off of Venril Sathir, you
hand in the Staff of Gabstik LAST, and you get the pack that you take back
to Solomen to turn in for the epic.
