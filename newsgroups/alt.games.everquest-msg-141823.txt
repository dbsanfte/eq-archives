Ok i know ive said many times that trade skills are retarded... I still
think they are!

I have to get 170 or so smithing though :(  help!

Current skill is 115 but this is about where ive hit a stumbling block that
my knowing F.A about trade skills is making it difficult

There are some things that DO matter, some things that DONT matter.. and
some things id like, but dont really care about.

Things that DONT matter

Cost.  Doesnt matter if it costs me 200pp or 10kpp..
Item success.  I don't care if i succeed in making the items.. I just want
skillups

Things that DO matter

No item farming.  Im not farming shit or running all over bazaar trying to
buy components
Sub-smithing items.  I dont wanna have to make 5 stacks of xxxx (which are
trivial) to be able to proceed with doing some skillups (unless its
impossible)
Speed of skillups.  I don't care what i make.  Theres absolutely nothing
from here to 170 that will be of benefit to me or my alts
Not making suff that the vendor only has a limited supply of the items.  E.g
ornate chain.. i ran all the way to qeynos but Yakum Oreslinger only has a
limited supply of ore, and all the HQ ore I needed was gone.

I know its refreshed on spawn, but hes immune to attacks so I can't kill
him, and Im not going to Perma or where ever to farm shit for the ore supply
quest.

So basically.. can i get smithing to 170 by being lazy?
