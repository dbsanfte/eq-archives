Laugh, happens every day, all day long.  Stranger passes you on the road,
stops, comes back.  Sometimes stands silent in front of you for a few minutes,
sometimes walks right up.  Exchange:
Stranger: "hail jennaii"
Jennaii: stand, sow, sit
Stranger: thanks jennaii
end of repetitive story...
(much more likely that i will stand up and respond if there's plat in the trade
window)...
