That's who my Wizard does much of his soloing.  The RL activity is usually
reading a book or watching TV.  (A Tivo or UltimateTV is really nice for
this...notice I've medded to full, hit "pause" on the TV, kill something,
start medding, hit "play" on the TV).

For people planning to play this way, picking a race that has "hide" can
help.  The "sit somewhere safe" part is a lot easier with hide. :-)
