The trick is to stay off the snow while fighting, getting over near the wall
onto the snowless area will get you out of aggro range of the roamers
(giant and wolf), you can also meditate freely there as long as noone
else is pulling into that area.

On the other hand, killing giants in GD really doens't do much at
all for faction, the hits are quite tiny.  Go to Kael and get in a group
or raid if you can, or pratice the fine art of kill tagging, using a
very low damage low mana cost spell to get the faction off things
others are killing.  Unlike exp, faction hits aren't divided up, every
person on the hate list gets the full faction hit, so if you stay out
of the way and there's no risk of you KSing or breaking mez (and
giants can't be mezzed) or getting aggro, hardly anyone will object
to this. In a day you can achieve faction increases that would take
weeks in GD.
