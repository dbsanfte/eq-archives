I posted this on my tailoring guide today. It bears repeating here, as
well. If you've got a soapbox that gets 11,000 hits a month, you may
as well put it to good use, I reckon...


Important! A message about viruses!

My email address apparently is found in a lot of address books, as
I've had over a dozen people send me the w32/badtrans.mm computer
email virus in the past two days. The same thing happens each time
address book viruses make their appearance. Happily, I'm an old hand
at online communication and safe procedures, and my computers have
remained uninfected.
   
The dozen people who sent me this virus so far thought they didn't
have to worry about viruses, and they were wrong. If you think that
you can't get or transmit a virus, you are just as wrong as them!
Everyone has to take an active role to ensure they don't get, or pass
on, viruses.
   
This kind of virus is incredibly easy to avoid getting. All you have
to do is not be stupid. Here are some guidelines for avoiding becoming
a victim or pariah...

- Don't run any email attachments unless you know exactly what they
are and who sent them. Ever.

- When in any doubt, just delete the attachment immediately.

- Buy, and use, any of the excellent anti-virus programs on the
market.

And if you can't be bothered to do those very simple things...

- Don't put my address in your address book, because when I receive a
virus from you, my response will be to your email administrator! I'm
sorry that I have to speak so bluntly, but I'm tired of coddling
people who are ignorant about the most basic aspects of computer
safety.
