Drugs have done 100 times more for the evolution of human thought than
philosophy ever will.

Seeing how you have little respect for others' philosophies (take God's name in
vain often?), I doubt you'll acknowledge or respect that viewpoint either.  In

form a coherent thought.  Or something.  

No matter.
