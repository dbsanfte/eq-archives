there are several proven ways to make money.  I should know, my main char
has over 300 K plat.  my goal is 500 K and then 1 mil K.  I have heard
rumors of people having this much plat already.

One is to buy low and sell high.  basically be a middleman.  Alot of people
don't like to sell stuff, and so they intentionally know its worth a given
(X) amount of plat but will sell it even lower (X minus 50 to 2 K plat) so
they can dump it faster, thus allowing them to spend more time accruing even
more stuff to sell and get up levels instead of sitting around trying to
sell "junk" all day.  Other people sell stuff low because they didn't bother
to check what its worth (this also happens in real life).  So if you have
some plat to work with you buy it low, and sell it high.

Another way is to have someone who trusts you  ( requires alot of trust), to
allow you to sell their stuff, and you collect a commision based on how much
it sells.  So if you sell off golden boots of efreeti for say 4 K plat, and
your commision is 10 or 20 percent, you earned 400 to 800 plat for your time
selling it off.

Yet another way is to set up a gambling game.  You can only set up a
gambling game if your 1) ethical and always pay fairly 2) have enough plat
to cover all bets and enough plat to cover bets in the foreseeable future.
gambling is a zero sum game, meaning it takes away from others to put money
in your pocket.  If someone is losing their shirt, you should advice them
not to bet what they cannot afford to lose.  Gambling is addictive,
especially when winning, and its also possible that if you don't have the
plat to cover enough bets in case the odds go against you for awhile, you
could lose everything yourself.  Another determining factor on how it goes
for you is where you set up "shop" to get customers to play and the rules of
the gambling game itself and how much in favor it is for you.  If you make
it too much in favor of the "house", no one will want to play at all.  If
you aren't honest that it is in the "house's" favor and aren't honest at all
times, you could conceivably be banned from EQ all together.

another way is begging.  (alot of people really get pissed at beggers
though)  Having so much plat I usually give away like 5 to 10 plat to anyone
who bothers to ask for money.  I think I recently stopped giving plat away
from newbs mainly because they could easily lose their equipment until 6th
level and I don't like to throw away plat.

collecting needed items is also a good way to make plat.  HQ bear skins and
HQ cat pelts in and of themselves are worth something on a server that has
been around for awhile.  I know on bristlebane HQ bear skins are worth 30
plat at the lowest end, and alot of tailors will buy them fast because they
can make 100 plat backpacks.  Even with a few failures, that is still plat
in their pocket.  ( example was on a new server and was just checking dead
critters was finding, found a HQ cat pelt, and happened to have someone
auction it in zone to buy for 5 plat.  so my newbie char suddenly
effectively just found 5 plat.  for a newbie, that is alot. )

Another way obviously is making needed items, from being an armorer , tailor
,  jeweler , and fletcher among many.  Probably the most lucrative is the
Jewelry Craft, mainly because almost everyone wants to fill those slots of
rings and earrings with something useful to them.  My enchanter has 250 JC,
so he makes the highest end of items often.  above and beyond his 300 + K
plat, he has 20 blue diamonds and other raw materials to make a variety of
items.  stocked up on blue diamonds mainly because I thought it was going to
be a rush for luclinite blue diamond jewelry, guess I was wrong.  : 0

Researching where to hunt for various pieces of things you need / want, and
going there specifically to get those items.  This probably doesn't seem
like a money maker, but its definitely useful to have knowledge of where
things are and also those who don't feel like doing the research might just
wanna buy extras you pick up along the way.  Some things that should be
researched are  / what dungeons drop what / hunting spots and what approx
value of items are and where they drop.  levels of dungeons/zones so you
don't walk into a death trap unexpectedly.

Your equipment is hugely important, as it determines how effective you are
on the front line.  My druid twink was a great example of this.  With a few
people who were missing equipment, I could easily hold the front line
against 3 or 4 critters without even worrying about it, and could also heal
the others "newbs" around me so when I was there no one else was dying.

My druid reached 14, WOOT.  SOW!!
