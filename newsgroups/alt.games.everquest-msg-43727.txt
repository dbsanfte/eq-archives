I'll give an "AMEN" to that.  It's great that I can do 40% more damage than
a War *IF* and only if I can get 100% backside.  That rarely happens, even
if I try to evade all the time.  We don't have any kind of evac options, or
the AC/HP to withstand hits while we flee, or FD -- I don't want any kind of
melee changes for rogues - I want something that will give us a small chance
for escape when things go bad (ie. chance for mem blur when evading well out
of melee range, to simulate a 'complete' hide)
