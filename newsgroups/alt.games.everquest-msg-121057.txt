That is your largest problem. I have 576 meg of ram and In XP right
now with virtually NO services running, IE up, Agent newsreader
and an IRC program I am using 126 meg of real ram. So I'm using 
pretty much your FULL amount of ram without doing anything very
intensive. EQ is going to run pretty darn poor since there is just not
much real memory to run it.

You need at least 384 more meg of ram to run EQ "ok," or if you set
texture quality to low and have a 64 meg graphics card just 256 more
ram might be fine (even with all luclin models, as I did okay before
my ram upgrade)

Because verant disabled the ability to do this in a windows friendly
way, to discourage hacking or macroing or something. The biggest hack
advantage programs, such as Show EQ, don't even need EQ to alt tab
anyway so its moot.

Sorry, you are really not supposed to run anything while running EQ.
Once you get more ram try EQwindows, or try it now. It lets you run EQ
in a window at pretty much the same acceleration as when its full
screen. With 128 meg of ram you have nearly zero chance of doing this
though. EQ windows is at the hackersquest site, just do a search for
that.
