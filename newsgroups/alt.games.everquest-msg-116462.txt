I think it is time for them to put in an alternative to the major boats, for
everyone, not just Luclin customers.  Simplest thing would be to just make
The Nexus a free zone, downloadable by all, rather than a Luclin-only zone.
The Nexus is a very small zone, so putting it in a patch would not be a
problem even for modem players.
