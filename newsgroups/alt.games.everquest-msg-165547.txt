On some servers, perhaps.  On Tunare, at least, the "uber cartel" kept
numbers down and prices up.

Nope.  I've not yet gotten my hands on a Windblade.  Between having
bought some cultural armor and a Massive Dragonclaw Shard, plus
misjudging the Blue Diamond market and buying too soon during the
crash, I never had the 20k (best price I ever heard of on Tunare,
never lower than 34900 in bazaar) in hand before they nerfed the
drop rate.  Not that it matters much.  We've seen this show before,
the price'll slowly float down towards 20k or so.  I'll get one
eventually, or something equivalent, either by purchase or by drop.
The one thing that's always been true about EQ is that patience works.
Mudflation is EQ's analogue to entropy.

Is that all it takes?  80kpp and you're happy?  How're you ever gonna
be ooburr with a lackadaisical attitude like that?  :-p
