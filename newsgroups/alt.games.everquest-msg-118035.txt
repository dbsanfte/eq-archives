Well, you got a hell of a wake up call coming when you grow up, leave
mommy and daddy's house, and get out into what we like to call "the
real world".

It's not your time they're controlling, it's what you do with that
time on THEIR PROPERTY. They can tell you to get the fuck off their
property for whatever reason they feel like (except, of course, for
race/religion/sex/etc). And the servers you play the game, the game
itself, and even the characters you play are their property.
