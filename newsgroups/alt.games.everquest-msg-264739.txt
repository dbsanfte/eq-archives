Well, tonight they did instance Antonica on Beta 1 and Commonlands on Beta 
2.  Definitely much more playable now, and still lots of players (though 
obviously not as many as before).  Did a /who when I zoned after the server 
reset and there were 100 players in.  On the boards the devs said the zones 
have been handling up to 300 before the combat lag problems began.  So I'm 
guessing somewhere around or just shy of 300 is what the instancing size 
will be for these two zones in release.
