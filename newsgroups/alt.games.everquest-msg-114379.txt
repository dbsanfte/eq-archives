Being a monk, part of my bread and butter is being able to throw. But since
they "Fixed" the archery bug, I cannot throw. Period. At anything. Here is
what I get :

Target is too far away
Target is too far away
<moving closer all the time>
Target is too far away
<really close now>
Target is too close to use a ranged weapon

Anyone else experiencing this very annoying bug? Without throwing, I find
myself having to use stonestance much more often, and catching many more
beatings on the way back to my group.
