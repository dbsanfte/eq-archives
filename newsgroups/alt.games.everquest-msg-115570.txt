I believe there are 6 black reavers that spawn about every 2 hours (I've
never pulled them so I haven't paid much attention).  That's it.  They
aren't monopolizing the zone at all...there's LOTS to get xp on in CoM for
the correct level range.  But they ARE preventing anyone else from getting a
REAVER without paying through the ass for it if they're regularly there when
you want to get yours.

Or maybe I'm not understanding your point.
