We are taught that these particular words are intended to convey a specific
meaning which is different from other words with a similar meaning.  The
reason they are rude is because that is what society in general feels about
them.  There are a lot of things that society in general dictates that may
seem stupid to some members of said society.  Why is it considered wrong, in
general, to be seen without clothes on?  Is that any less stupid?
