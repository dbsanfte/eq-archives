The only one seriously implying "conspiracy theories" or anything
similar was Faned and others accusing SOE of kicking off bazaar
traders...

Okay, where the fuck did I say anything about Sony never doing
anything wrong that brought on the "Sony loves me" bit above? Good
god, you're digging up the old "VAK" lame again? 

Summary of this thread:
Empty and Faned: SOE is kicking off paying customers just to save a
few cents on bandwidth here and there. I found out how and how to
prevent it, but I'm not gonna tell you!
Tyger: Cite.
Faned: Uhhhhhhh, I don't gotta! Neener neener!
Tyger: Yup, pulling shit out of your ass.
Faned: Nuh-uh! Nuh-uh!
Tyger: Then cite. Back up your claims.
Faned: I don't gotta! Neener neener!
