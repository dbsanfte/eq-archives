Yeah, can be teleported to Iceclad without having been there before,
but its dangerous, almost always get jumped there, and its the only
one that I don't mind paying extra to get someone to take me to. Ever
had your gater get jumped and die?

As for Colbalt Scars and Wakening Land, I wouldn't even mess with them
until become non kos to dragons. Kill lots and lots of giants to fix
this.

Great Divide is fairly safe, but have to travel on foot and get tooth
first.
