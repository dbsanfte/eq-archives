Yeah, I forgot to mention my idea of Guild banking. Say a person in the
guild needs some money to work on a trade skill, but the guild banker isnt
on, and the money is already aproved. It should only take say an officer to
go to the bank and get it. If the officer dont have a key, then they should
be able to go to the bank and say I need a guild key, and the banker should
give him a key to the guild bank. Also, that would also need to implement a
new item type, called "Guild Rent" Now, unless you are some newbie guild
leader, you will trust your officers, and they will trust you. Any officer
that would rip off the bank would me KoS (I play PK server, so players are
more easily kos to me) Just a thought
