Sadly, it *is* the only way to 'keep up'.

Granted its not about 'competition', but 'keeping up' is critical to 
being able to group with your friends, and keeping up with your friends, 
allows you to maintain social contact with them... I quit for a year 
once because I simply couldn't keep up with my friends, and got burnt 
out trying. (Between my preference to explore, play deep in dungeons and 
do quests in spite of the inefficient xp, and their desire to level as 
fast as possible and thus choosing to grind more often than not...top it 
off with the fact that I played less hours per week... it was a hopeless 
situation.

Its like that hypothetical 'level up button'... if you choose not to use 
it you'll get more out of the game, but you'll never be able to keep up 
with the vast majority who won't be able to resist pushing it... and 
pertually being left behind can be disheartening.
