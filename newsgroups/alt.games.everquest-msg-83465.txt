The Bread delivery quest is still alive and well but even with a level 24 druid
it is much more difficult and time consuming. Sporali in Runnyeye, all types
from my experience, even the defender's, very rarely drop the "bag of bread
loaves" lore item. At 24 a druid has Ring of Feerot and can bind in Misty right
outside Runnyeye, then head to the Sporali, gate to Feerot on the rare drop and
deliver to Innkeep Morpa at about 1200, -200.  It raises faction with Merchants
of Oggok, Clurg and Oggok Guards.
