I love your rhetorical questions.  To answer your question I would say no.
He didn't come acrossed as someone that insist on everyone playing the way
he does.  He came acrossed to me that he didn't understand why people like
twinking.  Possibly you could inform him on why you like twinking instead of
your slap in the face comments that you like to make so much.
