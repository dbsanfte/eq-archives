I've never been able to explain that to a non-programmer and have them 
understand that "no, I'm really not hungry", and "no, I'm really not tired" 
while I'm coding.  It's an odd phenomenon that has happened to me ever 
since I started coding all those years ago.

Same thing happened when D&D came out.  We could play for 24 hours straight 
without getting hungry or even slightly tired.  Then, we'd quit, and in 5 
minutes it would catch us and we were so weak from hunger and sleep 
depravation we HAD to eat and sleep.

Same with EQ, but not as badly.  I get tired and hungry, I just forget to 
eat sometimes and don't -want- to go to bed 'cause I'm having fun.
