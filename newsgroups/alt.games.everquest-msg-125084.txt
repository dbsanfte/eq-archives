This would suck.  But in my experience on MT its a very rare occurance.
Sure its theoretically possible that a month would go by off list, but
in reality clerics actually -want- their epics, guilds actually -want- to
help get them... there's probably nothing easier to get a raid force
together for than Ragefire.

Recently (only time I recall a problem with the MT list) a guild waited
the required 3 hours, killed Rage, then randomed the drop between
their two clerics.  The cleric that won was number 67 or so on the
list, while they had a cleric at around 20 also in attendence.  Personally
I don't see the problem, since at that point the spawn was technically
FFA, but you would have thought the sky was going to cave in.

Eventually things settled down, it was clarified that a "been up
3 hours" Ragefire is indeed FFA and you can decide who
gets his drop any way you like.  If you are on the list, you
leave the list on getting your drop, you don't get to hang on to
that slot and give it to your buddy.  Oddly, this suggests that
the guild is better off giving the item to their cleric in the
worst position... since the low number clerics will be getting
their fair shot soon enough.  Most guilds seem to agree though
that they plan to give FFA Rage to their lowest number
clerics despite being allowed to do otherwise.
