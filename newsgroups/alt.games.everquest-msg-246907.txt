Toon is shortened cartoon which is a reasonable term for an animated 
avatar, which are the normal terms applied in FPS games where the avatar 
is an in-game projection of the player.

RPGs are theoretically different in that ones 'avatar' is a 'character' 
with a life of its own...with a skills, personality, and abilities not 
projected directly from the player behind.

I'll grant that avatar/toon isn't really role-playing terminology... but 
its not d00d speech either... just FPS terminology... which is how a 
large number of people play EQ.
