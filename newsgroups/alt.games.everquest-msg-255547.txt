LOL!

> EQ2?

EQ2 isn't out yet or even in public beta so we'll have to wait to see. But
see below.

CoH can last you a lot longer than a few weeks, I've played it for a couple
of months and enjoyed my time with it, but there aren't a lot of EQ players
who feel that way, so don't expect your experience to be any different. And
until they add some new content, that will probably be the upper limit for
most people. I was pretty disappointed with the first major content update,
it was greatly oversold and tremendously underdelivered.

As for Lineage II, I didn't play it long so I can only give you surface
level opinions.  It's got a nice graphics engine (Unreal? I forget) with
attractive models (although a very limited number of them, so expect most
folks to look pretty similar for a long time), but I didn't find much else
positive. In my short time with the game in beta I was pk'd (non-consensual
pvp) in noob zones three times under level 10, and experienced massive,
overt bigotry and anti-US hatred in an unfilterable shout channel. The game
had the best possible environment for griefers and l33t dewds I'd ever seen.
No name filters (with some of the most offensive names I've ever seen in an
MMOG). Crappy controls, with Diablo-styled click to move, that cannot be
reconfigured. A horrible chat interface with windows that cannot be moved
and text that looks like a typewriter stepping on the graphics engine. All
in all, not a very immersive experience, and mostly frustrating to play. The
franchise is enormously popular in Korea, so I suspect there's some good
content awaiting for those who are willing to put up with these
inconveniences. Perhaps someone with a more positive experience after retail
launch can provide a balancing opinion.
