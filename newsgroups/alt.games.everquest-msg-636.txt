I just had my very first successful /petition - answer myself.  One of
the merchants in Qeynos had been attacked and moved out of position, and
wouldn't sell.  (Sneed.. only one who sells milk in north Q.) Following
the advice from this n.g. I petitioned, and within about five minutes a
GM informed me that she was on the way to re-set him.  When I got back,
he was all set. Very nice.
