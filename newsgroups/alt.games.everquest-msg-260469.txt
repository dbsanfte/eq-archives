Wineq is good, but god help you if you're trying to zone out due to a
train, one of your guys is gonna die.

had that problem last ngiht.  The zone time from CoM to EJ is
horrific, and if I froget to to autorun one guy to zone and switch to
other *before* he hits, the guy left is dead.

Luckily it was always the cleric that zoned first....
