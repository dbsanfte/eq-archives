*shrug* you were being a smartass.  Purposely obtuse.  If you're being an
*ass, don't be too surprised when someone fills in the asterisk with another
word. :)

Appropriate response could include silence or a "no, sorry, I hate the
letters 'plz.'"  At level 14 an even truer response would likely be "no,
sorry, I don't have the mana."  I don't know how shaman do it...being bugged
at 9 when SoW is a damned expensive cast at that level.
