It's not a single skill, but a combination of moves that allows the rogue to
drop down on the hate list and return aggro to MT.  When the rogue takes
aggro he/she turns off auto attack, steps back and hits hide.  A successful
evade will give the message "you have temporarily ducked away from main
combat".  When it is successful the MOB will immediately turn around and
start beating on the MT, allowing the rogue to start backstabbing again. At
this point the rogue should wait a few extra seconds before engaging to make
sure MT has aggro firmly established again.

This does a couple of things.  First of all it allows the rogue to hit from
behind, where he/she does the most damage and can help take the MOB out
faster.  Secondly it keeps the rogue from taking damage which allows the
healer to concentrate on healing only the MT.
