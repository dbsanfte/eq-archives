 From what I've seen of the Paladins in DL you should just be glad that
they weren't playing Clerics or Enchanters.  I suspect that 9 out of 10
are some solo dr00d's PL'd twink, clueless about grouping, tanking, and
especially clueless about hybrid combat casting.  If these idiots were
playing a class you normally depend on to save the day when everything
goes to hell, well, I hope you have an alt 56 Cleric to do the rezzing.
(Oh and don't even dream that they might stun or root that Rager on the
Druid or Enchanter, it simply isn't gonna happen, they're too busy
telling their guildmates how oober they are, and probably don't even
have the spells mem'd).

Idiots are often seduced by the lure of pretty stats.  As has often
been pointed out in this group, AC is the number one priority for
tanks.  And yet, back when I was moving thru my 40s it was not
unusual for me to encounter heavily twinked Paladins with gear
far more expensive than mine who had great stats and yet were 50
to 100 ac lower than me.  I think these are the same sort of folks
who used to play "prom queen" Warriors back in the days before VI
fixed Paladins and Shadowknights.  I remember a 45 Warrior who told
me she could not get the Mino Hero below half, I have solo'd the
Mino Hero with a 37 Paladin who's best piece of gear was Netherbian
Chitin, but she looked very nice, Celeano would've approved.  :-p

rofl.  It's been quite some time since that was true, as well you must
know.  There're even some half-adequate weapons available now for those
of us who have real lives and thus can't (or couldn't) hope to make it
to the front of the Vox/Naggy treadmill-queue.
