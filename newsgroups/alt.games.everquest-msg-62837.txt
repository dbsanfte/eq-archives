The Black Iron Medallion can't be even given away anymore... I guess
your best bet would be off vendors, in fact, or auctioning *for* it,
rather than waiting for it to come up in auction. Pay 20pp tops.

On the other hand, the Black Alloy Medallion is a really nice neck item
for a druid, with AC and WIS. I think it will have gone under 500pp by
now.
