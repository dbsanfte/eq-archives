OK - I noticed this after Vellious first came out, and about a week ago, it
got worse. Is it taking longer to log on after the server selection screen?
I used to get a few choruses of the theme music, and then I was at character
selection, now I listed through the whole song, TO THE END (I didn't even
realize the thing HAD an end) and then I have a few seconds of silence
before I get the character selection. Is anyone else seeing this trend?
