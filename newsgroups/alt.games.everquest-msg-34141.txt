Just made 35th level as a cleric!  I can see!  I can see while I meditate!
I can see!  =)

Anyway...

Where is the best place for XP for a 35th level cleric?

I do not care about loot.  I just want to level as fast as possible to 39th
where I get my first XP rez and then I plan to use rez donations to buy my
gear from that point on.

Currently, I'm in Overthere.  It was great when I first came there at 30,
but isn't as great of a XP grinder now at 35th.  Thus looking for a better
XP hunting ground.

Suggestions?  Comments?  Thoughts?
