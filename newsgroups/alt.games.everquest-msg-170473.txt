The most important thing you should understand is the Everquest conning
system.  It can be quite confusing due to the way they've set it up.  To con
a MOB, right-click on them and you'll get a message with a certain text in
it.

If the message is green or blue, do *not* try to kill this MOB.  The message
may say something about the MOB being "reasonably safe" but it's just the
MOBs AI trying to trick you into starting a fight you'll lose.  If the
message is white, still don't try to fight it.  It's dangerous.  You might
possibly get lucky and win but don't count on it.  If the message is red,
though, go for that one.  They're the best way to get experience safely.
They'll die easily.  If the message says something about "what would you
like your tombstone to say" (it'll say that sometimes) ignore it, it's just
the AI trying to scare you away.  Trust me, the MOB is more scared of you
than you are of it.  Good targets are guards, vendors, and class guild
masters and trainers.  They'll lvl you up really fast, trust me.

Anyway GL.  Have fun.  Hope my advice is useful.
