    It makes sense if you'd be improved by the drops, or if you're with
regular play partners. Otherwise, have to disagree with you.

    The last time I was in an adventure with a non-guildmember, a mask
dropped that would have been an upgrade to the non-guildmember. The first
words out of his mouth when someone reflexively rolled were, "So we're doing
greed looting?" That's why you don't see this attitude - people are
terrified of being labelled "greedy" if they ask for an equal shot at
everything that drops. In my case, I refuse to become an in-game charity for
other random players because I worked and got good gear, so no NBG for me. I
will do NBG for guildmates, though, as the argument that gearing them up
confers some benefits to me applies.

    And I'm glad I'm here. I refuse to accept the same risks and time spent
for lesser reward just because someone else hasn't progressed as far as I
have.
