You've never heard of SadoMasochism? Never heard of people who are
into pain? People who like hot wax dripped on their nipples? Me i'm
not into S&M but I have seen it listed enough times in
alt.binaries.multimedia.erotica to know it exists.

I didn't say you hadn't I asked if it had been broken first or not.
It's trivial to kill in POF alone after its broken if your a druid or
necro. 

PS you ought to get that whole stale urine problem taken care of, you
might get a bladder rupture from holding it in so long.
