Perhaps since they can allow people to have an LFG tag after their name, 
SOE could consider tweaking the code a bit so people can customize their 
status tag to say Kiting or InNeedOfAssistance or whatever so that 
others can interact better accordingly rather than the best option just 
being not to interact at all when it's hard to tell what's going on. 
Sure some people would abuse this feature for silliness, but then that's 
also useful too since they would be effectively giving themselves 
warning labels. ;)
