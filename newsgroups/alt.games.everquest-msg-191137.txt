Try the spectres on the island in oasis. If I remember correctly, those
should keep you busy quadding  on the south shore until 48 or so.  Just let
others know you are doing it so you don't train newbies that are hunting the
orc highway nearby.

Work on Claws of Veeshan faction also by killing/quadding drakkel dire wolfs
in Great Divide so that you become at least dubious to COV friendly mobs.
(Frost giants also provide COV faction but you will need to be in a group
for those at 42.)  This will allow you to port to Cobalt scar safely to
begin quadding the artic wyverns.

Hope this helps. Good hunting :)
