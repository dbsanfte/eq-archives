Well, yeah.  Rangers are only suppose to be in their element if they
are outside.  They derive their power from nature, and crap like that.

And with Velious, they have outdoor zones, chocked full of animals
that will get them all the way to 60+.

Shadowknights.  More HP and AC than rangers.  The ability to heal
themselves (to an extent). Decent damage output (including spells).
Snare and fear.  

Only thing that would make them better would be a regen item, Iksar BP
or Fungi if you have the money.

FWIW, I agree with you on the fact that ranger archery, especially pre
Trueshot, is overpowering.  I can see how they might have a problem
with Trueshot, but I don't think it's really imbalancing in any
significant way.

Still, I don't think the changes on test are really going to hurt
rangers all that much.  Some will have to change their tactics some,
but all in all it's a wash.

IMHO, of course.
