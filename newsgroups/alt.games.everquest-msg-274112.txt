On a side note, PGP is one of the most pointless and annoying things
on Usenet. There's no need for it. All it does is add clutter to the
post. There's no need to be that paranoid about someone impersonating
you on a newsgroup, because it's really not a big issue if they do.
Wow, someone posted with my name. Those who matter will know it's not
me, those who don't and can't figure out it's not me are too stupid to
figure out the PGP key thing anyway.
