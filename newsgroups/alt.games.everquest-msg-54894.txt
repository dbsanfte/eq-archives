Typical and exactly what any member of the secret cabal would say. If
you went and fucking admitted it, it wouldn't be much of a *SECRET*
cabal, now would it!!!???!!!!

So there you have it. You can either admit you're in the cabal, or deny
it, and in doing so, prove that you are, because only somebody in the
secret cabal would deny it.
