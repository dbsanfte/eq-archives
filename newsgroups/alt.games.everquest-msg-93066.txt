I'm curious about the sound and music in EQ.  I'm a newbie and don't know
what I should be hearing.  I never hear any music in the game except when
the game is loading.  Sometimes I hear sound effects such as my weapon
swinging or my cat growling but it is not at all consistent.  I have all
three sound sliders (sound, music, and realism) to the far right (I assume
that right is all the way up as I can hear sound effects just fine
sometimes).  Is there supposed to be music playing?  Are the sound effects
suppose to play all the time?  I'm running WinXP Pro with an SB Audigy.  Is
this the typical MS WinXP/Creative junk driver issue or am I missing
something obvious?  Thanks for any advice you can give me.
