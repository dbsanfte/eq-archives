Hunting bloodgills is easy if you have good swimming. Best if it is above
175. They swim fast. Best way for a druid is to pull 2 at a time with lev on
swim up to the surface and run to shore then start your kite. Pulling four
can be done but you will get hit a lot till you get the kite started. There
are 12 bloodgill spawns and 1 spawn for the marauder. The marauder drops a
medallion piece for a key quest to one of the higher level zones. Long
quest. There are 2 spawns under each of the platforms on the East side and 2
spawns under each of the columns on the West side. There are 4 spawns in
front of the doorway on the West side lower than the column supports. The
marauder spawns in the doorway and is rare and random. The barracudas spawn
in 6 or 8 places around the structure about half way between bottom and
surface. They will not come ashore but if you agro one it will make for a
rude surprise when you go back in the water.
