No, AFAIK, Leisure Suit Larry never did break into online gaming.  Er, 
not that a sweet, fine young lady as myself would know about those 
games...

Now, the first thing to do in making it an 'adult' game is to 
reinstitute genitals.  And of course, we'll have to make size inverse to 
how much the person brags/KSs/camphogs/etc.  And if he or she does it 
all, we can make them a giant, walking penis!  What's a better visual 
clue to say "don't ever trust this person"?

Gosh, I would, but I didn't get the peanut butter out for a MONTH last 
time.
