See Invisible isn't the same thing as seeing through sneak/hide.  For
PvP it is, but for NPC the ability to see through sneak/hide isn't
based on a spell.

It appears to be a flag set on mobs based on some combination (which I
haven't the patience to figure out).

In otherwords, having an NPC capable of casting See Invis doesn't mean
the mobs around them will automatically see through sneak/hide--they
may see through Invisibility/Camo spells however.

Basically, for sneak/hide, you pretty much have to go by trial and
error (usually very painful errors) to determine what does and doesn't
see through it.
