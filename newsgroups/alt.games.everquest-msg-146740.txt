	I know the user interface update is not new, but is new to me.
I put off using it until i wanted to use the bazaar. Now its a must.

So i got it working ok, but my autoattack key has been redesignated as
the 1 key. I went to commands and tried to change it to tilda but it
didnt take effect. 

Do I have to log after changing the key to represent auto attack (or
any other key?)
