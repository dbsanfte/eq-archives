|And Strength and all the other maxed (or massively increased) stats

	Which do nothing, or next to it.

	It was 2 minutes, and the example in question is extremely out of the
ordinary.  The random number generator puked in his general direction.  And it
was against an old-world low-AC mob (as raid targets go).  You can't hang a
case for Rangers regularly outdamaging Monks on one parse.

	Arguing over who does the most damage to Rumblecrush, in the scheme of
things as EQ goes, is like arguing over who gets to be valedictorian at summer
school.  (And FWIW, the only times I've ever fought him, he was walled.)
