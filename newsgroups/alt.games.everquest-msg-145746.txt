    Skyshrine also has good HPs/MANA for a bracer. Were it me I'd ditch the
Supple Scale Bracer for the 15 WIS one, and only swap in the Supple when I
needed the range. You'd likely be on a raid then anyways, out of AoE range
or behind a wall, and the resists/WIS on the 15 WIS one wouldn't be needed.
Don't forget, when figuring out your post-15 WIS bracer stats, to figure in
the replacement for the resist item you could ditch if you had a 6 all saves
bracer.

    If they do it, you get forced into doing it because of when they want
notification to hit the hotkey. But as a system, it blows. Like I said, you
have no flexibility to adjust based on what you feel the heal rate should
be. It's really a system invented to allow bot clerics to participate in a
CH chain.

    Counting too fast is never a problem unless mana is a problem. Counting
too slow is the only possible problem. And I wouldn't worry too much about
the double fizzle - level 39 spell, you're pretty safe. I can only remember
once where my CH fizzled twice (I have three casts of it in my CH hotkey, so
I remember the "PHEW!" feeling).

    In general, for a rotation to have any hope of practical success, # of
clerics times interval > 12. Otherwise you get frame rate lag on spell gem
refresh and mod rod time widening your planned intervals. If it equals 12,
modding will widen the intervals.

    Experience teaches in a way discussion cannot. We have guides on our
message board telling people where not to stand for some Vex Thal fights.
Well, after some people stood in the wrong place, that naked corpse run back
to VT through Maiden's Eye and past the just-popped Rumblecrush taught them
to never do that again. Same fight next day, no adds - everyone stood in the
right place without being prompted. Mind you, they didn't need to make that
run. We had a cleric (me!) camped there, and just needed to wait for a pop
to despawn after an hour. But people who don't read guides also tend to be
impatient. ;-)

    We have all the melees carrying rods before the fight starts, and when
the mob is engaged they all drop them and charge in. That's where the "No
Trades" thing came from - melees never remember to look at their feet and
drop straight down.

    You allowed them to do something they otherwise could not have done, and
you admitted your mistake (the target on the mage thing) and figured out how
to improve. They had no basis to say anything bad about you. I'm surprised
that the other clerics there didn't ask you why you didn't assist one of
them to re-target...... (ie. I bet they didn't know to do that, either.)

    My guild, collectively, is uber. I'm just a_cleric01.
