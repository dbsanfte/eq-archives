Why would you report "Choklitdrop", dude I think your oversensitive on
that one, "Darkie" I can understand. But "Choklitdrop" doesn't sound
offensive in any way, sounds kinda sweet and cute especially if she
was female.
You might as well report "DarkTyger" if your that sensitive. I just
never understood people that run around and report people that are
just playing, Like someone said , Its just a game.
