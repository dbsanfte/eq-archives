Since youare a Monk you will be KoS no mater what. Humans are KoS as Are
Iksar.  The best trick to get your faction if youare Iksar is to fill 16+ 10
slot bags with War Braids ( drop off of Beserkers Everytime) get a Dark
Elf/Ogre/Troll elusion put on you ( buy an Essence of X pot) turn in all the
War Braids 4 at a time. This will make your Iksar non Kos. Now you need to
turn in 16 More Back packs full to get to your Max Faction state and get a
CHa buff + allyour Cha gear to get your Hammer (you can skip this last part
and just run over while your Elusion is still up, but I would still sujest
turning in some more Braids just incase your are on the KoS cuff.)

The OT hammer is a great item once you hit level 50 and can use it. If you
start working faction now while the beserkers give good Xp it isn't that
much of a hastle.  The one thing is if you use elusions to get it and are
still KoS, you could gate your self right into a" Loading... Please Wait "as
there are Guards that wander right by the Boat that you port into.
