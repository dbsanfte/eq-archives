 Thanks for suggestion Adam but as I said in previous post I've updated all
drivers, I've got plenty of machine and can't see why mine would go from not
doing it from a couple weeks ago to doing it constantly. I agree that Isp's
crash and all that but my cable has always been stable. I don't think I go
for this being done to us on purpose but I do think there was a bug in the
last patch or something. I just hope they at least look into it and not just
keep blaming it on our systems.
 For instance, I went in to Bazaar yesterday morning to set up traider,
there was 430 traders, I set up my trader and 20 sec's after I did, wham
back to desktop. Took me a few minutes to get in because it said I had an
active character still in and when I got back in there was only 220 traders.
You can't tell me half the people in game is having computer problems. I did
set up and it stayed alot of the daytime but last night I set up twice and
it crashed both times. It's just so random it's freaky.
 Good luck all and hope this get's straightened out.
