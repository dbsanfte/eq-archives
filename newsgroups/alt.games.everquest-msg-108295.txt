From personal experience, both as a Ranger and a non-ranger.  Rangers are
reasonably welcomed in groups.  Rangers have two things going for them for
a melee class that keeps them a desired group, Tracking and Snare. Groups,
especially in Karana and large open areas, love Rangers with tracking and
snare ability, due to the reason of pulling in nearby mobs for the group
during the pop waits, and Snare due to not wanting to chase a mob all over
the place while it is low on health.

Ranger Tracking is better than Druid Tracking, as Druid Tracking caps at
around 125, which is 24th level.  Ranger Tracking also allows filtering and
sorting, which means a Ranger can find something based on proximity, or
filter out mobs that are green to pull only the good ones.  If you ever
seen the track list...  It lists off everything without filtering.  For
Druids, you only see whats in range and recent pops, but not how far.

I have a 23rd level ranger, but grouped with some higher level melees...
He says he loves my Ranger because of snare, which makes fighting a little
easier as it prevents mobs from running at low health and it doesn't
require root, which forces Mobs to fight back.

Any caster worth their salt, would like to have a Ranger in the group if
they can't have a druid, mostly for the snare and track ability, especially
mages in South Karana when looking for Quillmane.
