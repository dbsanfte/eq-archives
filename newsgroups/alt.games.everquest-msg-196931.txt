The story of Seru himself is so convoluted that it's not difficult to
see how the problems arise.

There are several different factions in and around the city of Seru;
there's the Eye of Seru faction, the Hand of Seru faction, the Foot of
Seru, Seru faction itself, and sundry others I misremember right now. 
These factions do not all agree with each other; all of this makes
sense if one considers the story line of Lord Inquisitor Seru (LIS)
himself.  The guards and inhabitants of Sactus Seru believe that they
serve a good man, which is why they are not KOS to mosy light-aligned
races; in fact, however, they serve an evil vampire who pits his own
people against each other in subtle ways.  If you are an evil race,
the guards in Seru will NOT be happy with you and may well be KOS
dependent on the faction of the guard - Hand, Eye, etc. Light-aligned
races should be fine there, unless you start killing the guards - that
will change your faction quickly, which explains why my high elf
cleric is KOS to most Seru factions.

I found out all of this while hunting for the Seru shard for the Vex
Thal key.  It is extremely interesting, and I have to say it is one of
the most well-thought out storylines in the game.  The factions
involved follow this storyline strictly.  It does make traversing this
zone rather difficult at times, but hey, it's adventure. :)
