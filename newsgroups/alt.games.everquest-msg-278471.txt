Hi folks - I have just trecently returned to EQ1 from EQ2 and have one
rather basic question (among many) but this one will suffice.

How does one activate these VeteranRewards? I've got them in my AA tabs
(last one on the right) but have no clue as to how to activate them or
transfer them to a hot key.

Assistance would be appreciated.  thanks

DavidN
