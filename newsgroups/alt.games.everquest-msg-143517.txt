Penny wise, pound foolish.

A Rusty Two Handed Sword is worth a couple gold sold to a
vendor, or turns a level one pet into a damage dealer like a level 12
pet... on prey your level one character is going after.  Now use
him to kill spiderlings and a little later spiders, and gather drops
that are worth platinum rather than silver and gold.

That same rusty two hander in the hands of your level 10
pet also made it a damage dealer like a level 12 pet... but
your prey is a lot harder than the stuff you were killing at
level 1.

Its at the very lowest levels that equipping your pet with
the highest damage weapons you can come by really pays
off.
