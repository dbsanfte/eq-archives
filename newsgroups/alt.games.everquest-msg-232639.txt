It's just a fact of life.  I started as a human, which meant I had 80 (!!)
STR, but far less WIS then a high elf.  So while I could carry more stuff
without being encumbered, I had a smaller mana pool.

Just learn to live with it for now.  In the end, your gear will overcome any
stat discrepancies you may have.  Mana's more important anyway.

What you may want to look into is some weight-reducing bags.  To start off
with, player-made backpacks have a 10% weight reduction and can hold ten
items to boot.  Later on, as you get more plat, you can start looking at
buying a Sewn Bag of Evil Eye or a Rallis Pack or any of a number of other
bags that offer up to 100% weight reduction.
