Ever since Luclin came out, I've seen all these screenshots of naked
characters.

Well, thanks to the wonder that is /dopropertinting, now I can take my own!

Of course in the hour since I discovered this, I've nearly doubled the size
of my screenshot folder. eheh...

Thank god those ogres and trolls have loincloths on still *shudder*.

And for those wondering, yes, there really isn't much of a point to this
post other than to confirm that I'm a hopeless pervert.
