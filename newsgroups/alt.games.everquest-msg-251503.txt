Of course they do.

Even then... they still do have a role. While that role can in some
places shift on old-world obsolete mobs, when you play the areas built
for those players they can't do anything but their role.

I take it you don't play the high-end?

Of course there are reasons. GoD was setup as an expansion for the
high-end. For guilds, there are only so many times you can farm Time
without pulling your hair out.

No.. what you don't realize is you were having a severe economic
depression then. If anything, the travel system alleviated the supply
issues so that it helped meet demand. As a result, your average player
has a lot more pp than they ever could have dreamed of 3 years ago.

Not always true.

And plenty of them are coming back and saying it doesn't have staying
power, mainly because it is a stripped down version of a MMORPG that
is heavily mission-oriented while not providing other things to do to
mix things up(i.e. tradeskills). But feel free... if you think CoH is
for you, by all means play.
