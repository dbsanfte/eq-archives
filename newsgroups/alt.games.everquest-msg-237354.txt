Don't forget to make a hotkey that looks similar to:

/pause 40,/cast 1
/pause 40,/cast 1
/pause 40,/cast 1
/cast 1

to save wear and tear on the digits.

You may need to adjust the pause value (40 = 4 seconds) depending on
the spell refresh timer.  Put the spell you want to pratice in spell
slot 1.  Stand in Nexus or PoK, target yourself, and fire when ready.
