I wondered how long that would be in-game.   My main is a 51 cleric
and my wife's a 45 mage.   We were camping the Taskmaster in
Echo Caverns and I just couldn't understand why some mobs would
agro on me when they spawned nearby but not on her or her pet.  It
turned out that she'd forgotten to remove her Amulet of the Haven
after selling and was actually not KoS by default.

Damn handy, though, for a little while.   She could sit and med in
perfect safety, with mobs actually moving past her to agro on me,
who's a lot more capable of taking the first few hits.
