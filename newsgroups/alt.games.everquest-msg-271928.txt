Of course you can solo them.  There are solo gnolls of the appropriate
level range wandering in some parts of Antonica (north of the bridge
near Blackburrow, IIRC).

And I'd be really surprised if there aren't groups fighting gnolls,
since the first armour quest for heavy armour wearers requires killing
lots of gnolls and most people seem to do those quests, at least on
Runnyeye.
