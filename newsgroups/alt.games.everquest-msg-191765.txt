Heh, RZ is a pain.

I think its more of a lesson in patience (for an ultra tedious event) as
opposed to a super difficult mob, though.

Im sorry if this sounds mean....  but by the sounds of it, you don't deserve
to be in the elementals.

Just curious, but did CiH know you bound sight on them?   Every guild/server
ive seen something similar, the resulting flames and accusations have been
quite harsh....

Anyway, extreme gimp tactics aside, I do wish you luck with RZ.

Didn't it bother you when another cleric thought, and did, just that?

You may find pet-zerging quite an unsuccesful tactic in todays, or the next
big patch (its been planned to go live for quite a while, but they keep
cancelling and re-shceduling).

Which part of the "strat" was new to you guys though?   That a 500+dps pet
was able to keep Agnarrs agro? :)

On a side note, I wonder if even 50% of HoHb-flagged guilds will be killing
RD once the charm changes go live?

That trial is quite unusual.... in its current state I think its far too
difficult for the reward (shitty loot and 1 third of a MM key) - but with
charm, the event is 100% gimpable (tier 2 guilds could zerg the living crap
out of him with pets which shouldnt really happen, but tier 3 guilds can
wipe or fail based on something as random as the random-resist generator...
harsh)

This made me laugh irl :)

IIRC, you didn't "do" nToV back in the day, right?

I guess I'll have to check to be certain.... but even with SoW, DA+DB
running from aarys pit to PoM just isn't realistic

I mean, from the moment you leave the pit (flurry drakes at the top), your
DA would be faded somewhere around Vyemms area, maybe just after, and thats
like 20% of the whole journey.  Those mobs would drop you in about 2 rounds
(they are called Flurry drakes because well, they flurry.. a LOT)

You turned right.. or you went the "correct" path?   Going right from aary
pit would take you to kriez etc (whilst they all lead to the same place in
the end, going right would surely be a much longer journey)

A lot of my guild does that.... happily AA's away, despite the fact every
death makes them drop to 64 (before rez) - I just don't get it.  Just the
ability to not mem my spells while waiting on a rez would drive me nuts (not
to mention situations where you need to be rezzed in, but are unable to sit
once in, and need that spell... not to mention a few bad wipes on a raid,
and you could be perma 64.. ouch)
