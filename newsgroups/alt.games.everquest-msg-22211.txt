I got to have some fun last night.  I was in Freeport to meet someone at
the bank (making an auction purchase) and a level 1 something or other
comes up and apparently inspects me.  I have the inspect notification
turned off, so I don't generally care if you inspect my gear, unless you do
what the level 1 did.  Which was to say "bne armr is crap for csters.  Get
btter gear.  Cn u gve me sum plat?"  Needless to say, I was not amused. 
I'd just hit level 44, and was playing with my new spells, so without
saying a word, I hand him a Modulating Rod.  He apparently wasn't as "l33t"
as he thought, since I guess he instantly clicked it to see what the effect
was and dropped dead on the spot.  I put him on /ignore before he came
back.
