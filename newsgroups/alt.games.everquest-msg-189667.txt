True. I was simplifying a little, I'll admit.

Their mana regen is much higher than that of PCs - ergo "effectively"
bottomless.

Still lots more than PC wizards. True of NPCs across the board, but
especially painful given the high DPS of a wizard.

Oh, I agree that cleric nukes aren't as bad - I know this from personal
experience (my main is a cleric). Cleric NPCs are a pain partly because
they can heal themselves, but just as much because they can heal the
wizard next to them. :-) Which is why the cleric NPCs usually end up
near the top of most groups' hit lists...

Darn NPC casters team up against us... can't they let a group of players
kill them in peace? :-)
