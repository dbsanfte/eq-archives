Whenever I see that, it reminds me of one of our guild's high-level
(at the time) Shamans.

She was Level 52, running through LFay, and she got jumped.  As best
we could figure, she got jumped by 2 of the Scouts at once.  She
didn't last more than about 30 seconds.  (This was a long time ago,
obviously.)
