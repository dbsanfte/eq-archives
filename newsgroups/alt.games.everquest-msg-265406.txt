The way the surname is supposed to work is similar to a guild.  One person
registers a surname, then invites others to the "Family".  In this way you
can have the comraderie of a group without the added issues of supporting a
guild that this game imposes.  I have yet to see anyone with a surname, and
there doesn't seem to be any solid info on the beta forums.  I also have not
heard anything from any Dev about it.  So no one seems to know at what level
you can choose or if you even need to reach a certain level.

I do know that the Guild registrar doesn't at this time offer surname
registration.  As far as I know, no one has a surname.  I haven't seen every
player of course, but I will do a search on the player stats site to see if
I can find anyone with a surname.

I also can tell you that Guild status points are bugged as hell.  Once we
formed our Guild we had access to the 4 NPC's that give "writ" quests, for
Guild status points.  Each of us got 4 quests, as you can stack them by
getting one from each NPC.  Once we had completed all 4 as a group for each
person (some were the same and overlapped, such as "kill 10 grizzled
badgers") we each had contributed an average of 5000 status points to the
Guild.  Starting at level 1, we now had only 30% XP towards Guild
advancement.  So it's gonna be a long road.  Also, with the most recent
patch, they have announced an increase in the XP requirements for each level
of the Guild.

The bug came in when the next time we logged on, our Guild status points
were either much less or missing entirely.  The Guild advancement did not
change however, so we still had that at least.  Now it may not sound like
much, but for example, to rent an upscale property in Freeport, on the main
drag, costs a large amount of gold, AND 500,000 or more, much more, status
points.  So I can only imagine that the point reward for higher level quests
is MUCH higher.

Once you consider all of the above, and add in that only Patrons can
complete guild quests, and that Patrons are limited to 36 per guild, you can
see that Guild advancement will be a slow road indeed.  And the highest
level of guild that has been published seems to be level 25, so lots of work
for anyone interested in maintaining any kind of Guild status.

I will try to find more info on surnames and post it here.  I am guessing
they have just not implemented that portion of the game in the beta yet, but
we'll see if I can find more info.
