Actually, I was experiencing a bug in Befallen a week or so back.  There was
a decaying skeleton right by the entrance that was just annoying to look at
but I couldn't attack it (said I was too far way).  Anyway,  a guide came
along who couldn't see the skele I was talking about and then attempted to
"see through my eyes" and still couldn't.  (It went away after I zoned and
then came back in).  But bottom line is they do have the ability to at least
see what you are seeing ... can't comment on the communication and/or
possess you & walk around though.
