Of course I consider it. I also consider the possibility that the fact 
that people are very succeptible to episodes of selfishness, greed and 
apathy could very likely be at the root of the problem as well.

Certainly. I am just extemely skeptical that this is one. I understand 
the trials are difficult, extremely difficult, even impossible for groups 
of inadequate level ranges and/or lacking gear. I get that. I truly do. 
It's impossible for me to solo an ogre guard at the moment (I think). If 
I really want to do that, I need to level up and/or upgrade my gear. The 
point is it can be done, it may just take some effort to give myself a 
chance at success.

And about the guild stress? I can see where it would be stressful. 
However, for the level of stress to get to the point where the guild 
breaks up over it, they obviously had issues to begin with.
