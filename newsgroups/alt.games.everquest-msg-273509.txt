Working on the new quests in Lavastorm last night, I was mostly running
around invis so I didn't have to worry about agro from the green mobs.
I found that giving quest items to the NPCs did not cancel invis.  I'm
*pretty* sure that's a change.  Can someone confirm my recollection that
it didn't used to be that way?  E.g., I'm fairly sure that last week when
I was giving things to the new guy in OT, it was breaking invis (and thus
getting me agro from the guards there).

It will certainly make many quests a LOT less nerve-wracking.  Unless of
course it's a bug and they change it back. :-)
