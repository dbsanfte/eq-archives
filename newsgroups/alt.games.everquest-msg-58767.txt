Well, it's too late to do it now. And personally, I will twink, so I'm
not that interested anyway. However, given the interest by a lot of
folks in limiting it (though I'm willing to be that the majority, but
not all, are lower level folks who can't twink) they *could* have done
it from the beginning. The answer, IMO, ties into one equipment option
pointed out above. All gear could have had a "When could you *really*
get this item?" level assigned to it. Make it something rediculous,
like, what's the minimum average level character you could form into a
raid of, say, three groups and obtain this? Then, just make that the
minimum level where you could *equip* the item. It would eliminate the
need for <any> no-drop items. All planar gear would be, by default, 46
or higher to equip. 
  Not just weapons, either. Armor and stat gear too. Take, for example,
a FBR. If low level characters could muster the social skills and
organization skills to get together a four group raid on Najena, what
level would they have to be to work their way through, get the keys, and
kill Najena to get a chance to roll on that robe? Twenty? Fifteen? Ok.
So you can buy, trade, or be given an FBR at any time, but you can't
equip it until level fifteen.
  As I said, too late to do that anywhere now, but if there are really
that many people out there who want a no twinking environment, then I
suppose Verant could have a "no twinking" server with those rules in
place. Hell, maybe they could scrap SZ and start that over as a PvE no
twink server?  You'd see a lot of folks in the lowbie areas in leather
and banded weilding fine steel if they were lucky enough to get it.
Might draw a bigger population than SZ is now, anyway.
  Of course, *I* woulnd't play there. (*smirk*)
