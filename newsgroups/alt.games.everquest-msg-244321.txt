<snip good explanation of forager/hunter cycles>

I know that.  Like I said, I farmed the *cycle* for a full level back when I
was 59 or 60 for the iksar mask.  I know how the spawn is supposed to work,
and I know the names that can spawn.  The forager and his placeholders are
not spawning now as far as I can tell.
