I figure there's a huge difference. Dungeons and Dragons was an awful
movie critically speaking...but, being a long-time RPer, damn it was
fun to see. >< ( Hell, many RP campaigns probably would have gone
exactly like that. I swear to this day that the writer just put a tape
recorder in on a group of RPers and converted their game into a
movie... )

Well...My point is, they are not exactly widely-known movies in the
US. Matter of fact, only way some Americans may have heard of them is
playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeapordy... ><
