I can assure everyone, it was not the entire newsgroup.  Only Luc.  He got
bored, so I suggested he start a flame war between either alt.troll or
alt.games.everquest.  I suggested your group because of the sheer amount of
posts you generate.  Luc's post was supposed to be lost in a sea of posts.
I thought Luc would have enought sense, and do something else.
