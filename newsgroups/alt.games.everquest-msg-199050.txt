The guild has not disbanded, a few people split off.  The guild is still 
going strong, still doing pretty much the same stuff it has been doing all 
along.  I still have many friends in the guild, just chose to try the new 
guild that was created by several folks that left due to tensions that were 
severely exacerbated by the flagging issues.  I still think quite highly of 
TA, and, if things don't work out with the new guild, that is where I will 
likely end up again.
