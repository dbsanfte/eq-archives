Hi!

Reading through the newsgroup, I seldom see people having trouble with W2K
riggs, but often having trouble with XP.
Now, is there someone, or maybe even several people, that have had nearly as
much trouble running EQ from a W2K rigg compared to running on an XP
machine?
Are there drawbacks to running EQ on W2K, I mean except the fact that since
there is so little downtime with W2K, there is no time for coffee breaks?

Regards, Marshmellow
