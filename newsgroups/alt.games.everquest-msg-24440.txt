Pets at that level can cook?  I didn't know that.  I've been spending time
learning to bake and now I find out that they will act as butlers and
gentlemen's gentlemen, as well.  Silly me.

At level 16 you can dual wield the MoSS in the off hand with a good 1hs in
your primary.  Skill will go up fairly quickly.  I'd throw a few training
points in to bring it up to 20, or so, if you have the available.
