Well, you hvae very similar stats to my computer, but I have a PII-400 
rather than a Celeron.  Do you have your display settings so that the 
screen stays same resolution?  Unless you're playing at the lowest 
resolution, if you hit f10 a couple times it should cycle through three 
views, old-style, with all the hotkeys and everything in the border on the 
outside of the screen with the display in the center box; overlay, with 
the hotkeys and stuff in semi-transparent overlay over the display; and 
the clean-screen, with no hotkeys or text-box or anything.  When you cycle 
between these three settings, does your display freeze up for several 
seconds while it recomputes the resolution going between the old-style and 
the others or is the old-style screen displayed in a box in the center of 
the display, with black borders around it?  
I would suspect that the reports of people disconnecting or crashing are 
related to the video card having to switch resolutions on the fly.  Try 
setting your display option to 'screen stays same resolution' and let me 
know if this fixes it.
