Personally, I've found that in the PoP zones, just because you can kill
stuff, doesn't mean you should be there doing it, because it is too slow.

I know you made a post earlier when you were unhappy that people suggested
it was too slow and wanted to move on.

But I've played a number of characters from 46 to 56, and watched my wife
player her druid to 62 in the planes, and my experience is that fighting
the white, yellow and red mobs in the first tier planes at 46-53ish, with
the entire group being that level, is slow.  It's slow pulling, slow
killing, and slow xp.

Being higher level than that, even though the mobs go dark blue, and are
providing less xp per kill, the xp earned speeds up.  Because the kill rate
increases dramatically.  Being able to kill four yard trash mobs in PoI in
2 minutes, is far better xp even if they're blue, than killing one ever 2
minutes when they're red.

It does slow down eventually, PoJ entrance is slow xp even with quick
pulling at around 55th.  But XP in PoI didn't go quickly, until we started
putting groups of 55th-60th together, even the yard trash.  Yes, you can
kill the stuff while lower than that, and you certainly don't need everyone
in the group to be 55-60th, but it's about pull rate and kill rate, more
than xp per mob.

>I can say that even in a full group, I wasn't impressed with exp

Because the pull/kill rate is too low.

But PoJ is an order of magnitude easier than any other first tier zone.
You can get fast XP in PoJ with a 46-52 group (bring your own mezzer).

In PoN, I got about 40% of 54th in a kiting group, 3 mages, 1 wizard, 1
beastlord, in about two hours.  One of the mages was 62nd level.  If we'd
been higher level (up to a point), we'd have got faster xp.

The other thing, your comment about the XP Nerf - and taking Sony on their
word - they suggest the planes xp was lowered only enough so that there is
less xp for soloing, but still more xp than there used to be for groups of
2 or more.
