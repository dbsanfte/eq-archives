Ow and in the weeks before LoY came out there were also other GM events with
pirates attacking various spots.
I personally halted 2 GM's who were killing people in OT (including my
eq-wife, which was the reason I came down there in the first place). Some
lvl 50's group of another guild was fighting them but they ran to PoK after
the GM's destroyed their 2 melee.
The GM's ran after I 2k-bolted them a couple of times. Neither had more then
15k hp or so and my pet was stunning them so they had a hard time getting to
me :).
Some other spots which were "invaded" were butcherblock, freeport and
Firiona Vie, but I missed all those events. They were broadcasted across the
server though.
