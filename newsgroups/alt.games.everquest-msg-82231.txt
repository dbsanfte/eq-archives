It has to do with a LAG.   When the boat zones, it takes a bit to
syncronize.  If you're lagging, the boat syncs, turns, and catches up to
where it should be.  If you're lagging, you fall in the ocean and are sent
to Sis Isle, rather than your bind point.

Used to happen to me all the time.  Now I just use the Nexus for my guys who
can't TP by themselves.
