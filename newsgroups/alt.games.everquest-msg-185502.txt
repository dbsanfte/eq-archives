Actually, Clinton was respected over here in "Old Europe". He still
is. I can tell you that Bush is neither respected nor taken seriously.
He's pictured as uneducated but fanatically religious cowboy on a
powertrip. He's done more damage to the States' reputation than any
other president I actively remember. His speeches alone are incredibly
embarrassing and damaging.

The thing is, Europeans, as whole, don't have huge issues with human
flaws like the Monica episode. We do, however, have issues with
powertrippers who believe they own the world. We have plenty of
experience with them, too. They all went eventually down. There's
comfort in that thought.

Yes, Europe owes the American people. Speaking up against a president
who destroys the stable relations with most of the world is part of
the favour we return. To the Americans, not to their government. A
government which wasn't elected by a majority, let's keep that in
mind.

Now if he only messed up the States, I guess that would be less
painful for those of us who didn't even have a chance to vote against
him. But we all pay for this, figuratively and, looking at the current
prices for gas, literally.

Ah well.
