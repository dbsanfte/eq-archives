Based on observations of other people raiding: Follow
instructions. Don't move unless you're told it's okay to move. Don't
attack anything unless you're told to. Follow instructions. Don't get
aggro. Stay in range of the healers. Don't hit the mob from the
front. Follow instructions.

Keep in mind I've never been on a raid, but those are things that seem
to be closely connected to successful raids.
