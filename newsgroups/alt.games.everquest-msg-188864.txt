It takes more than sheep to make the world go round, you may have been
"called" to do more than just work and make money, there are higher
callings, God may have called you to a different task from just being like
the crowd, look at the prophets over history, many didn't get married or
have much money if fact some had pretty dismal lifes, look at the Apostles
and the early church, they achieved far more than just work and a pitiful
amount of cash. I know for a fact God uses people in many ways to do many
things as does the devil get people to do wicked things .

There are 6,000,000,000 or so people in the world, take pride in the fact
you are responding to God's calling in your life 99.9% people seem happy to
just work and make money to mearly survive the storm of life the best they
can, there is much wickedness in the world and the world is run by good and
evil people who do more than just sit back and work make money and
reproduce. You don't need vast amounts of money to achieve things look one
of the most power things in the world today the media ( no pun to persia Dan
8 ) and news information is power, excellent intelligence can identify and
home in on the root of evil and destroy it, looking at todays war in Iraq
and what happened in WW1,2, excellent intelligence can massivily reduce loss
of life and target the enemies exactly. Very few people run "the show" evil
is being hunted down by stealth and noise reaction and the light ( not
illuminati ), mis-information abounds ......

As a Christian you have to be willing to be on the front line, if you choose
the easy option of the world go get the money and the job, if you are called
higher don't be like Jonah unless you like smelly fish

John 3v20,21 let the light shine
