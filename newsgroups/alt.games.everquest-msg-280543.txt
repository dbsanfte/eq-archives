Figured out the problem, got the computer from a friend, and he had a
previous install of EQ still partially on it, shortcut was pointing to an EQ
that hadn't been patched since LoY!

Deleted that folder, checked the shortcut and and made sure it was running
from the right directory, and walla! no more 10day patch lol.

Thanks for the replies though.
