Mistmoore is RingOf Scale, that's Kunarks dragons.

Best way to get Coldain and Claws of Veeshan faction(velious dragons)
is to go on a raid in Kael Drakkel the giant city. Make sure you
do damage to every named mob the raid come across. I went
from amiable to warmly with the Coldain dwarves in one night.
Also went from 'Scowling' to dubious with the dragons.
