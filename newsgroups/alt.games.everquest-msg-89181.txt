I wouldn't bother. I'm on the older drivers, and I too am getting more
crashes to desktop than before. (Which was virtually *NEVER* on my
system. Maybe one in a month.) This weekend I had at least three... I
think four, including one zoning in to start a raid. (Most embarassing.)
I don't think it's a driver issue for the desktop crashing, personally.
Seems to be hitting people with a wide variety of drivers, cards, etc.
all of a sudden. Just another stealth "fix" they added in during the St.
Valentines Eve Patch Massacre.
