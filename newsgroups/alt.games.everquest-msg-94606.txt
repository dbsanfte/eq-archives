You nailed this perfectly. The Vah Shir are virtually identical to
barbarians in every way when it comes to factions and kos. It's almost
like they lifted the entire barbarian race and planted it with new
models on the moon. Even the barbarian faction quirks (like the
rogues) still exist for Vah Shir.
