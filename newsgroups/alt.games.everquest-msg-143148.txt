Heya all!
Long time no see, but I am back, and now that I am less addicted, I have
time to do non-gaming stuff too :)

So, I have spent an hour every now and then to create php-scripts and enter
MySQL data on my website, and I am soon ready for full launch of Fizzl's
EverQuest Source. This site is dedicated to provide quality maps of EQ
zones, their special places, zone connections and rare spawns. I am not
intending to do a full blown database system where I would document every
piece of rat ears and orc pawn found in the game, but just the stuff I need
often. In a format that is easy to check with a quick glance.
Also at this time, my bandwith and server space is next to free so I can
give this all away with no banner adds or (F*cking) pop-ups. I might add
some non-harrashing text-link advertisements in future if I get greedy, but
I don't spend so much time on this I even feel the need to get paid.

So.. After all that blabber, if you are interested, check out my
work-in-progress at http://fizzl.daug.net.
The scripts are currently bugged (as the first news item on the frontpage
states), but I am working on them. you can see which maps' data I have in
database from Zones->List from left menu.

PS. Please don't kill-file me. I am not intending to spam this crap all the
time. I will always use the [SPAM] prefix in subject if i feel I am posting
something that can be viewed as an advertisement. :)
