I won't deny that there does appear to be a sort of person who chooses
cleric becausre it sounds pretty easy ("Hey, all I have to do is heal.
I can do that.")  It has been my experience, though, that these types
never make it up very high.  There are few things worse than an
incompetent cleric and such a person will eventually gain a reputation
that will make finding groups difficult.  I've seen it happen.

Also, it's hard to stick with *any* class past 50 if you don't
actively enjoy what the class does.

The flaw in your logic, however, is that *you* are subscribing to the
same notion as the dimwit.  It may be easy to play an incredibly bad
cleric, but hey, it's easy to play an incredibly bad anything.

The other night I did a "/ all druid 55" and so on up to "/ all druid
60" and counted them up.  There were about 40 online.  I did the same
thing for warriors and one or two other classes.  Warriors beat
druids, but no other class did.  And these are UNANON druids, mind
you.

If the class is so royally broken, why are so many still playing it?

I'm pleased to hear it.  When do you plan to start doing this?
