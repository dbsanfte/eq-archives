Ok, heres the result from Copelands:

Warrior with 100 str, with FBSS.

Level 40:
Wurmy     621
Lammy     584
Jade Mace 613


Level 45:
Wurmy 	  641
Lammy 
   623
Jade Mace 654


Level 47:
Wurmy     659
Lammy     659
Jade Mace 692


Warrior with 100 str, with FBSS.

Level 40:
Wurmy     664
Lammy     617
Jade Mace 648

Level 45:
Wurmy     684
Lammy 
   656
Jade Mace 688

Level 47:
Wurmy     702
Lammy     692
Jade Mace 726

Level 48:
Wurmy     703
Lammy     693
Jade Mace 727

Level 49:
Wurmy     720
Lammy     728
Jade Mace 765



So if you take a look, Wurmy are still equal to the Lammy at level 47 
with 100 str.

With 200 str Wurmy is still better than a Lammy at level 48.

So i dont see how anyone can think a lammy is better if we look for pure 
DMG.
The Jade Mace is clearly better, but since the discussion was 1hs 
weapons its not that interesting.

And again you have to realise that not everyone have a higher level char 
to get money to twink their warriors. On my server you can get a Wurmy 
for around 1100pp now, a Lammy is still 6K, a Jade Mace is 8-9K. So 
again think of the many people their first or second char as a warrior. 
They MIGHT be able to get a Wurmy, but Lammy or Jade Mace is cleary out 
of the question for a LONG time.
