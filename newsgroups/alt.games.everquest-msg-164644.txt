}This brought back some memories for me.  What was everyone's very first
}computer game.

It was a game called 'snake' for the Commodore PET.  Basically a precursor of 
the lightcycle part of Tron.  Ohoh, but before that, dad and I put together 
one of those old Heathkit 'Pong' machines.  First adventure game was a 
text adventure called adventure, strangely enough.
