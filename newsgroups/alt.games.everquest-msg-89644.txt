Events that I was in on Veeshan sucked.  We were attacked by 8 named
elephants, which was funny.  All were red to a level 35.  What did they
drop?  1 potion with sow of 1 charge, and about 15pp.  Wow.

The other time I was in a GM event I was helping a gnome GM kill Dark Elves.
Some lvl 60 guys came and helped with the event.  What happend in the end?
3 hours laer of listening to the GM ramble and roleplay, he showed us how to
make fireworks... what a waste.
