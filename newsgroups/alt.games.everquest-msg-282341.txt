That depends on what you want to achieve. The original question was
whether you could be killing without downtime or not. And I said you
could if you adapt your killspeed to your mana regen.

You are right that you could kill faster and med up afterwards if there
weren't any more mobs around.

But sometimes I just want to mindlessly go about killing mobs for exp
and then I choose the no downtime way. Because it lets me kite nearly
asleep. :P

If I want something dead fast then sure I'm rather generous with mana.
But then I don't care about downtime anyway.
