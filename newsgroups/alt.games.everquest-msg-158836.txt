Zone up to PoK from any convenient spot... if you aren't near a town, I'd go to
Nexus as the closest PoK portal.  Now walk over to the Overthere portal.  Pop
back down.  To your astonishment, note that you aren't in aggro range of any
guards... then recall that all the PoK portals are like this.

It isn't only non druids that benefit from PoP, there are some destinations that
are far easier to reach for -anyone- now.

One of the best items in the game for a non-gater is now the Worker's
Sledgemallet, which once put you in a remote spot far from anything and
relatively low on porters for hire... and now puts you near a connection to
Everywhere.
