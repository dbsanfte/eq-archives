Can we all try to SNIP SNIP SNIP or TOP POST?????
I'd much rather read a top post than page through endless repetitious postings
to see a response.  Just end your post with "end of post", so we know you are
done.
And those of you who complain about the top posters... I'm ok with that,
newsgroup protocol and all that lame ass crap,  as long as I don't have to PAGE
DOWN through crap to get to YOUR RESPONSES.
Bad, tiring weekend and not very compassionate right now.
I'm sure we can all do better, right?
