Thanks for all of the advice and it worked
pretty well.  The xp was a little lower than
I hoped, the loot was very very good, and
it was very nice having the bank right there.

I stayed until I ran out of bandages and
until my faction got too bad.  It can be
real trouble there at my level if you agro
everything.  I'lll post a longer description
of my experience if anyones interested.
