Quest's generally seem to be better at raising faction than killing
mobs. Unfortunately, you generally have to raise some other faction so
you can do the quest to raise the faction you want to raise. For
example  my Ogre Beastlord needs to raise his faction with the Dead, so
he's not KOS to one guard, to enter the library in Neriak so he can do
the quest to raise his faction with the Merchants of Neriak.
Faction can be a real pain and it's one of the reasons why some players
camp certain low level mobs like Deathfist Orcs and those people in
white dresses who hang around the wizard teleport spot in Nektulos
Forest. ;)

Cheers Watchman :)
