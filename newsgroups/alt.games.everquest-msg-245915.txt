counter examples:
Firiona Vie is virtually empty... its directly off the PoK.
The Warrens is usually empty, and is the same distance to PoK as PC with 
a significant ZEM of its own.

Precisely. CC or EW would have to be *better* than OT to balance how 
easy it is to get to OT. The zones close to PoK don't need to have high 
ZEMs they already benefit from being easy to get to. (Additionally the 
OT is very easy to get around in and solo in... CC, by comparison, not 
so much.
