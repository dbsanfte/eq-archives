It is fine that it IS the message for being summond, but it is also used
by mobs that ARE NOT OF SUFFICIENT LEVEL TO SUMMON, like i stated.

As for naggy and vox, I did not know there exact level, and that was why
I said and dragons.  Since they were prekunark I didn't know if they
were 50 with special abilities or over 50.  

You wonder why people seem to have a problem with you.  Maybe it's cause
you came in here and started stepping on toes and pissing in the face of
regulars to the newsgroup like your some king of the shit heap.  You
really do need to take a step back and reread your responses to messages
from an OBJECTIVE viewpoint and see why people seem to want to flame you
and have issues with your posting style.
