I suggest waiting till 16th level before you train a point in research
because the game won't let you put any points in that skill till level 16 :)

On Test right now, all spells between 51 and 60 are researchable, including
GSS, EER, Greater Familiar, and Flaming Sword of Xuzl, using new runes that
drop from higher level mobs and a new book acquirable in the Tox Forest.

When was Al'Kabor ever any good? Not much of a nerf if it always just sucked :)
I sent in a feedback asking them to change manaburn around to make it more
like one of the melee disciplines: activate MB and for the next (short time
interval) all your spells cost double and do double damage. But it will
never happen...
