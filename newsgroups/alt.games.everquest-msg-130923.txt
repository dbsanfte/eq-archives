Any class with bind affinity can "port" around already, by binding in TD. 2
places where druids can still pick up trade is ports to EJ (for sebilis) and
GD (for velks mainly). Not sure of the level, but I think they are both lvl
44, so by that time youve got much better ways to make money.

I suggest that you bind somewhere central in Kunark (loio/fm zone perhaps)
and leave your local auction channel on while you xp grind away. People
often need ports to wc.
