Argh, that's actually kind of frustrating.  My usual tactic with a pet is 
to have the pet whacking on something while I go pull something else, and 
park it with mez just beyond the pet's reach.  Pet finishes the mob it's 
on and switches to the next one over automatically while I'm out fetching 
a third.  But if the pet forgets all about it... oy.  This'll take some 
thought.  If only root were reliable.

Other than that, though, looks like a damn good upgrade. :)
