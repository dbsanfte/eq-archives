when you die you have a choice of being rezzed -- any priest can rez, not 
just clerics-- or releasing a shard.  When you a few shards released, you 
lose some of your stats, I noticed it mostly affecting strength mainly 
because i would get encumbered.  You have 3 real life days to pick up your 
shard.  If you have 5 shards and die again, your oldest shard poofs.  The 
really convenient thing is you can check your journal and it'll tell you 
what zones you died in and when you go to the zone you can get a line to 
show you exactly where your shard is.  Shards can only be seen by their 
owners.  Corpses can only be seen on the ground until the shard is 
released.
