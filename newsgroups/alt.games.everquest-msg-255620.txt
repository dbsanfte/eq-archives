Assuming your raiders are bottom feeding the same content; which
by and large, they're not. Ldon hards without clerics, tipt/vxed/ikkiniz
trials, etc, all leave a low margin for error even with raid obtained
gear.

My experience having been both raider and casual, and even having
toons in both types of guild at the moment, is that raiders group
content that others will, in the main, refuse to even attempt until
an expansion or two later.

The really ironic thing is that those non raiders who are willing
to bite a few deaths and learn end up getting EP level loot from
ferubi, tipt, vxed, kod taz, etc, the allegedly 'impossible to get'
drops, without needing to raid for it. Go figure.

Given the porousness of the raid/casual population, its irrelevant.
Many casual are in-vitro raiders, many raiders will be casual again,
their skill sets dont suddenly alter depending on current circumstances.
There are sucky players and there are good ones. Raid level content
and XP zones are undeniably more challenging though - whether you
want to say raid gear makes the subjective challenge greater or
lesser is up to you, but I can tell you right now I could heal a
LDON normal on my ranger with no problems and I have to pay attention
being backup healer in tipt on my druid.

The funny thing is that if they were willing to do the work the
contents available. GOD has much much loot of POP raid quality in
single group content. Its just not coming out of a vending machine
with an 'ISUXX' platinum card port on it ;/

Soloings another matter in terms of drops, but you can still solo
for XP in god too.
