  Yeah, at first I didn't think she knew what she was talking about, to us
in the room she kept insisting that the "web site is wrong" and also told us
that a 32 mb graphics card will be the minimum, and a 64 mb card will be
recommended (this is what she said they were "telling her around the
office").  On the web site, it says a 16 mb card will be required, and 32 mb
is recommended.

  One thing I could be wrong about is that you'll need to use the new
character models if you want to go to Luclin zones... this may not be true,
but I get the impression that the complexity of the zones themselves will
require 256 mb of memory, from what Calyssa said.  She was clear in saying
you would need 256 mb of memory to play the expansion.  She said you'd be
able to get to to run on your system with less memory, but without using the
new character models or entering Luclin zones.

  One possibility is that the requirements she was quoting are the
"unofficial" requirements if you actually want to PLAY the expansion as a
game and not a slideshow with 5 minute load time intermissions.
