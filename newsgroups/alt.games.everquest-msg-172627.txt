I was somewhere, on some board, it might have been the Shaman's Crucible but
it could have been Allahkazams. Or it could have been someplace else.
Anyway, the description was about this place where the MoBs come in waves
with like a big boss MoB towards the end of each wave. The MoB bosses each
drop some real good items. I know that could be ANYPLACE but I am hoping my
extremely awful, extremely vague description will trigger a memory. It might
have had a name like the trials or the fire room or something. TIA.
