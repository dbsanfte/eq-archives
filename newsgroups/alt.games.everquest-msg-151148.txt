like every good Gnome family who must tinker we have made the ever
popular to make (??) Gnomish Fireworks and now the kids want to do
forth of July, Gnome style.

How are these used?

We would love to celebrate with firework displays instead of the
obligatory 'woot' when appropriate as this would be a little more fun
than just paying for buffs with them. 

Giving Fireworks out to those kind enough to buff a Gnome couple is a
rare treat seeing as most characators who buff seems to want only to
buff the female elves and other long leg female (preferably scantily
clad) characators, leaves so much room for role play with those who
have bestowed this great gift but.

Every characator we give Fireworks to wants to know how to use and
none have been able to enlighten us, unlike the collapasable fishing
pole with the obligatory animated bait or the spyglass the fireworks
are much of a mystery.

Please is there a way to use these???  I see not any recipe for them
nor table on equiping them.

thank you.
