They are there for pretty much forever. The reason why verant did not
give you a straight answer is because they claim only 60 days or
something (or 30.. or 90.. forget exactly) that your characters are
kept if you cancel. However, they've never actually deleted any yet as
far as anyone knows.

So there is no straight answer to give. restart your account and they
are probably there but no way to tell.
