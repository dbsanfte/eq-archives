And the lack of rudeness that you perceive is just that, perception on your
part.

In an earlier one of the many threads on this subject I was asked to explain
why I found it rude.  So here goes one more time.

A long time ago, when I first started playing (very much post beta in case
it matters), back before you could control the message, I got inspected a
number of times, and this message popped up in my chat window informing me
that so and so was inspecting me.  I found it intrusive, I had no way to
stop it, and, at the time, I didn't really even know how it was done.
Whether logical or not, that particular feeling, which, I admit, has a lot
to do with the message that you are given, has remained.  I still find it
intrusive, and therefore, I find it rude for someone to inspect me without
asking.  I don't bitch about it, I don't go off on a rampage, it just leaves
me with the perception that the person who inspected me is rude.

I don't see how it is any more logical to say that it is rude than to say
that it is not rude.  The argument that it is a built in function of the
game is immaterial, I can find plenty of ways to be rude in game using built
in functions of the game.  I do understand that many, perhaps most, people
do not find it to be rude, I also understand that many, perhaps a minority,
of people do find it to be rude.  I prefer to err on the side of politeness,
and I always ask before I inspect someone.  I think I could count on one
hand the number of times I have even done that, I just don't see a need to
inspect someone, it doesn't matter to me one whit what equipment someone
else may or may not have.
