How is your performance in Luclin, like Shadow Haven?  What do you have
your clipping plane at for zones (like a list of examples would be
cool)?  What drivers are you using?  I got so frustrated with my Voodoo5
that I ended up buying a Geforce (still waiting), but in the meantime if
I can make the game playable, I want to try it out.  I'm currently stuck
in Shadow Haven, barely able to do anything but /camp it's so damn slow.
