Jazz:

"AGP" *should* mean that the cards match the exact form factor to go
into the AGP slot. The only common difference that I'm aware of is
that some AGP cards are actually AGP-Pro, which have slightly longer
card edges - a standard AGP slot will accept either kind.

It's entirely possible that IBM screwed you - what is the model of the
alleged computer in question?

Valien:

The fact that Jazz stated that the PCI slots are on a riser card would
further seem to support your theory here. I'm going to guess this was
billed as some sort of "slim-line" computer. Every time I've seen a
system that used a riser card, 'non-standard' has been the watch
phrase.

>I can't really tell from your description

Nor can I - computer innards are hard to describe. Jazz, you wouldn't
happen to have a digital camera, would you? If you do, take some
snapshots of the parts and slots in question, put them on a freebie
website somewhere, and give us a link. That way we'll be able to see
exactly what you're seeing.
