Lol, well part of why we managed that was a slow influx of people from 
dead and dying guilds above us...  To be fair though, we have had a 
steady slow influx from people burned out on full time raiding, people 
who have no chance at getting any equipment upgrades with us at all for a 
fair while.  They still enjoy raiding, but, now have kids, or 
girlfriends, or something else in RL going on, so, they come to us, about 
the only alternative on our server.  We are a serious part time raiding 
guild, with a fixed raid schedule.
