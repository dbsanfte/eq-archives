The real measure of what a player should, or shouldn't, be doing is
not always "what is the absolute most effective?" The best measure is
"what am I having the most fun with".

My druid still melees, long after the time when I've ceased to be
effective at it, simply because I *like* to whack the monsters with a
stick once in awhile. If I've got plenty of mana, I've already case
snares and dots, who is to say that I can't smack the critter if I
feel like it?

I don't play this game to win efficiency awards - I play to have fun.
