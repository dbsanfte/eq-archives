Did you restore from a CD recently?  If so, the INI file for the
trader may be read-only.  Removing the read-only atttribute may clear
it up.

I also found a similar problem once when the same item was scattered
throughout the trader satchels (e.g. Drakkel hammer, FG Toes, Drakkel
hammer, invis potion, FG toes).  By rearranging the items (e.g.
Drakkel hammer,  Drakkel hammer, FG Toes, FG Toes, invis potion) and
deleting the old INI, the problem went away.  I had to reprice
everything, so write down your pricing before you delete the INI file.
