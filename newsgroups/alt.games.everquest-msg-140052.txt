Eh, I wouldn't discount enchanter PL so quickly.  On a lower-level wizard, 
Berz Spirit and Feedback can work wonders.  Not as effective as a druid, 
but it'll do in a pinch.  I used that plus haste on a 39 monk in OT, and 
she was flying through the exp.

And that way, they work up channeling much faster since they can skip all 
that tedious rooting. :)
