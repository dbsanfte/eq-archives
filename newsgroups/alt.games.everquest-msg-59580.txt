Well to answer the first question yes the bandages are used for bind wound.

2nd question is you need to combine 2 Spider Silk to create a silk swatch
and combine the appropriate number of said swatches with a pattern to create
raw silk armor.

For more info on tailoring you can check out

Hope this helps.

Regards.
