Buffs usually have a much shorter range than even heals.  Definitely 
shorter range than detrimental spells (ie, the ones you'd be casting on the 
mobs).  Looking it up on lucy.fnord.net, Tagar's Insects (currently your 
best slow) has a range of 200, while Quickness and Greater Healing have a 
range of 100.
