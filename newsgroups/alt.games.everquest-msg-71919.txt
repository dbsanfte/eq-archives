What in the world did you spend $250 on?  RAM is about $100 max for 512 (I
didn't bother looking, sue me if it skyrocketed in the last few days :) )
and the very best GF2 card is around $125.

Anyway, back to your problem, what OS are you using?  Did you upgrade your
Via drivers (check Adam's posts today for a link to the update)?  Did you
update your video drivers to 23.11 and make sure that you have your latest
audio drivers?

Also try turning off the sound in Options (NOT in-game...the Options button
that lets you select/deselect the new race faces and dynamic lighting and
all that before you type in you name/pw).
