I tend to agree with much of thoughts on the lower end spells, I
certainly didn't even bother buying some of them- I waited till higher
lvl decent ones became available.

You missed one of the most important spells of the lot however - flash
of light (FoL). 

When flash of light lands it has 2 effects: (1) reduces mob's ATK (2)
causes fear effect on mob as soon as PC with the aggro is a few paces
distant from the mob.

So you can fear kite the mob by alternating flash of light with dots
and dd. Just cast FoL, wait a sec until you can cast again, take a
couple steps backwards away from the mob (it will start running), then
nuke, dot or canni as necessary. You can time it so that when it wears
off you can recast it before the mob gets to hit you again. When you
get your pet this will be even more efficient as long as pet does not
taunt and take the aggro off you. Obviously this is not so good for
mobs that cast.

I f you arent getting hit - you dont need healing. Plus F0L rapidly
gets up those divination skills.

Just make sure you know the mobs pathing so that you dont step away
into the path that the mob intends to flee on.
