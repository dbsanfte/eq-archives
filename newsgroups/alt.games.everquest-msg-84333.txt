One thing that I've noticed with Celestial Healing, its big brother,
is that once in a while you get a fifth tick of healing out of it.
That wouldn't account for 260 -> 460 though even if it held true to
Celestial Remedy (which I never played with due to being 49 or 50 already
when Luclin came out).
