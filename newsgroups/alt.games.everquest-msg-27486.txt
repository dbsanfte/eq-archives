ROFL!  That's a good one!

One of mine : -

Like the other day when I said to my friend, "I wish this feckin newb would
bugger off, I am being so polite its starting to hurt! Why can't they read
the feckin manual like everyone else"   (said newb was asking me
questions).......Then I realised I hadn't sent my friend a tell, instead I
had replied to the newb.....ooops.

Various offensive words came my way LOL

Felt guilty for a few seconds, then nearly fell of my chair laughing, yuk
yuk yuk
