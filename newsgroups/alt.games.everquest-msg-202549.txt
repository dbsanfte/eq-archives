A lot of the problem stems from the fact that untwinked Druids and
Necros can easily solo selected low reds at 25 (and at 35 too, for
that matter).  And I expect your BL will be able to solo some low
reds at 30 (new pet level) as well.  That sort of thing is always
gonna make for a lot of whining and arguing ("Mommy!  No fair!
Billy can solo reds, how come I don't get to?!"), which gets in the
way of any attempt at a rational discussion of reasonable limits to
twinking.  Of course, it's very difficult to discuss any sort of
limits with children, and many EQ players of all ages take a very
childish attitude towards the game, so I guess the whining and
irrational rationalizations are to be expected.
