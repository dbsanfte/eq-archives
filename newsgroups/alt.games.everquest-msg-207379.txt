Actually it was a disappointing change.  Even though Improved Damage is
random, most people assumed that Burning Affliction would not be.  Well, it
is.  So if you have Burning Affliction, your dot is going to do between
1-20% more damage per tick, which is checked every tick.

So yes DPS was improved, but not as much as was anticipated, and at the cost
of efficiency.  This change might have been adequate had it been coupled
with AA lines similar to SCF, but as it stands, I think the old focus effect
was better, which was basically +1 tick to most DoTs.
