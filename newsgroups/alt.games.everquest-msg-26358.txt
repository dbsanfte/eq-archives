Maybe I just missed it in this thread, but exactly what character is in
question here?  Race/class/deity perhaps someone could then offer you a
constructive suggestion.  As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread,
there is a route for evil players, well some evil players anyway, through
the tunnels of Freeport to the docks.  But without knowing who you may or
may not be KOS to, it's hard to make any suggestions.  Given your
circumstances, I would seriously consider some faction work for Freeport, so
that you are at least not KOS.
