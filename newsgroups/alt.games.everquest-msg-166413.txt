Thanks for answering
I think my setup is OK actually, 1333 AMD with geforce 2 pro 64 MB, I played
with 100 Hz before (with a patch from Nvidia ensuring 100Hz in any

bought wireless mouse and keyboard to play a bdistance from the PC, still
*sigh*.
I had some input here that seems to be for me to check,  especially Tiryas
