As one of the people here stated, there is a hate list when you engage
a mob. Depending how quickly you do damage, and what spells you throw
on it or your group, you can move up and down that list. Generally
spells like DoTs will throw you at the top of the list and so on.
Taunting slowly increments your value. Once you acquire agro, there's
no point taunting anymore since you're already at the top of the hate
list.
