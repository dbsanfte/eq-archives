  There are a few programs available. I have one that I can't seem to get to
work but I seem to be in the minority on that one. I think I found it by
doing a search for DX utilities.
  As far as play two Toon's at once.... No, you can't realy from what I've
read in the past. Well you can over a network but it's not very effective.
Reason one... You need 2 accounts and Reason two.... You waste a lot of
Bandwidth. Not to mention the getting confusing part. Trying to have your
Warrior cast while your Wizard nukes.... BAD VERY BAD.
  As far as TOS goes... From what a friend of mine told me (he asked a GM
about windowing apparently, I'd double check though) unless you use a third
party program to actively change the game (ie Auto Mappers, Training
utilities etc) your pretty much OK. As windowing dosn't ACTUALLY effect the
game, only your perception of it, I don't see how it activley effects the
game. Verant/Sony added the none ALT+TAB in so you COULDN'T use third party
software.
  The idea is sound but damn annoying. Every now and than I forget to turn
of my scan disk (I play late alot) as soon as it goes off... Bad things
happen beacause of the Full Screen.
