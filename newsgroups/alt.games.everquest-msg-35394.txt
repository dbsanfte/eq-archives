It isn't so much the inspection per se, as the idiot who runs up to
me, stands RIGHT IN MY FACE and inspects me that irritates me.  If
you're inspecting someone's clothes on the street, you are (hopefully)
somewhat circumspect about it and the same should apply in game, IMO.
Anything less is rude.

As a druid I get enough people running up to me as it is without these
morons, especially when I'm trying to talk to someone or, worse, fight
something.
