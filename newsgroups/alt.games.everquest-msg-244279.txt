When I was using this I would have similar problems with longer
macros until I found out you can map a button to a 'stop macro'
command.  This stops all macros, right there, no exceptions, even in
the middle of an active macro.  Its very handy when you need to type
something else in (and you don't have to time your 'on-off' button hitting).

That's got to be a lot nicer than yanking the USB cable every time.
Yikes!
