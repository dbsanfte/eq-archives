I hava a level 17 rogue, who I twinked with a crystal grinder (9 27)
for my primary.  I have been using a  focused ethereal long sword (6
27) in my offhand, to have a chance at increasing 1HS.  
I also have in my inventory a dragoon dirk (6 23) and a tombcarver (5
17)

So my questions are, should I even bother with keeping my 1HS skill
up?  Maybe I should just equip piercers. 

Also, exactly how does dual wield work? Mainly I want to know if the
weapon delay is a factor for the off hand as well, or should I go for
a higher damage weapon ie. dragoon dirk over the tombcarver?
