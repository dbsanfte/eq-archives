You know, I really was doubtful when you guys argued that we absolutely must
split the EQ and EQ2 groups.  But it does seem to have worked.

Look at all the conversation here that would have been overwhelmed by the four
posts that the EQ2 group has gotten in the last week.   Almost a dozen posts
over four days!   I can see that my posted concerns of the time, that there
would not be enough traffic to support two individual groups, were completely
unfounded.
