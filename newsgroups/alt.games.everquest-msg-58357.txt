Your question is too vague and unclear.  There is no correct answer to it.

Take this down to just one class, cleric.

What is the cleric's role in the group?

I still don't have information to answer that question.

What is the group composition?
What is the target?
What level is the cleric?
What are the levels of the other party members?
What strategy are we using?
What are we trying to accomplish?
Is there a single mob to be killed, or are we trying to maximize
kills over time?
What race cleric?  What stats?  What equipment?  What are
the skills? What is the cleric's general preference as to play style..
not that that is all they can do, but it will tend to be what they
are best at.
Same questions for the other group members.

A cleric -tends- to be main healer.  Often targets a single tank
and keeps him healed, sometimes ignoring everyone else's
injuries.  Med between heals, keep the main tank alive, don't
care about anything else.

A cleric may be a nuker, particularly in a group with another
healer and targettting undead... its hard to find a better
damage to mana ratio in the game than a cleric nuking
undead, if the mana isn't needed for other things.

A cleric may be on Fear duty, clerics get a very functional
line of fears, and partnered with a snarer this can be the
best possible use of mana, far cheaper than healing or
nuking.

A cleric may be on Stun duty, I often find myself unable
to do anything at all other than keep a mob stunned...
generally costs a bub of mana to kill a mob, and that
may very well be less mana than healing the party would eat.

A cleric makes a decent melee partner, particularly in
a fear kite, with the right stats and equipment, I regularly
outdamaged paladins my level up thru the end of 43.

Clerics also may function as crowd control (root, flash)
puller (stun pulls are particularly effective lacking a SOWer)
secondary healer, raid buff whore, be camped out in a
safe spot in order to res on raid wipe.... its impossible
to pin down a good cleric to what their role is.  Bad
clerics either.... only a mediocre cleric can be captured
by the classic "heal and med" definition of a cleric's "role"
in a group.

I'll wager that any class out there could give you a comperable
list of possible roles.
