He's good.

His brother is up and walking around (great news).  He'll be wearing the
halo for a while, but he'll make a good recovery.

My fiance talked him into coming for dinner (fried chicken, potatoes and the
works).  We went out for drinks at TGI Friday's and shot the shit for a
couple hours.  We had a blast.  He's great.

If only some people in this newsgroup were as able to leave the world here
behind and relax, it'd probably be a lot looser place.

E-mail me, TP.  Gots ta talk atcha.
