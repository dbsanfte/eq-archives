Oh, c'mon Dan.  "monotonously typical for Socialists and their ilk"?
How about typical for propagandists of <any> stripe.  The "big lie"
is and has been routinely used by governments and politicians, as
well as most any loudmouth with an axe to grind (ex: Rush Limbaugh).
Hell, as I recall it was Hitler's propaganda minister (?Goebbels?)
who coined the term, and the Nazi's were "socialist" in name only,
they were absolutely dependent on a cooperative capitalist economy.

Calling the "big lie" a "socialist" device isn't debate, it's just
trying to demonize the opposition instead of addressing any real
issues that might be involved.  It is very much akin to those folks
who accuse their left-wing opponents of being "politically correct",
all the while they're kowtowing to their own single-issue supporters.

Nuthin but a buncha rabid, unthinking, self-righteous, mud-slinging,
"I know what's best for you" fucktards making asses of themselves on
both the right and the left, as far as I can see.
