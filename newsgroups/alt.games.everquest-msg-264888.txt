   This is exactly my feelings on the issue as well, though the sugarman
said it better than I probably would have.  Plus, so much of the content
that as been added has been geared towards high end raiding.  In beta, or
at lower levels, a low server population is either a good thing or not much
of an issue.  At higher levels, it is going to be a critical factor.  I
believe I've read here that some of the people here in AGE are already
having trouble getting enough bodies together to do some of the encounters
they used to do with ease.  I think that problem is only going to get
worse, and people are going to start complaining about it.

   Here I beg to differ.  SOE has a huge reason to put any server mergers
off as long as possible.  Doing so will announce, loudly and plainly, that
EQLive is in decline.  Most of the people who play realize that, I believe,
but I think that still EQLive is considered by many to be King of the Hill
of the industry.  I think it will be a bitter pill for the devs and
bean-counters to virtually announce "Um, not any more, we aren't".   I
might be wrong (Heck, so far I'm the only entry for 2006, and only one
person has picked a date later than me.  Unless we count "never" as a
date.)

   I've been in this newsgroup for a while, and I've seen a few games
touted pre-release as "EQ Killers".  SWG and DAoC are two fairly recent
examples that come to mind.  I think I remembering seeing this claim for
WoW as well.  But EQII has two things going for it that make it different
from all those other games.  

a)  The word "Everquest" in its title

b)  The suffix "II" in its title

   New players, ones that have heard EQ is a cool game and they should
check it out, are going to see both titles on the self, most likely sitting
right next to on another.  A few might have done some serious research and
know exactly which title they want.  But I think that vast majority will
simply pick up the newer title.  EQLive will continue to lose player from
simple burnout, but they will not be replace as they have been in the
past.  I think that once the server populations start to decline (moreso
then they are already) the effect will be hastened.  High end guilds will
have a harder and harder time putting together raids.  People will start
complaining about how they can't get into the higher level content because
they are spread too thin.  People will start to leave because of this.

  When enough do, I believe that SOE will bite the bullet and announce a
server merger, just to try to staunch the flow of its lifeblood.
