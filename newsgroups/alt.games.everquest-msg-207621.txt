There are actually 10 pages of 10 hotkeys available, giving you
100 hotkeys total.  That should be enough for everything you
currently have defined on your "macro bank".  I still haven't
filled it up in 10 years of playing.

To hotkey a macro from your Alt-M menu, click-and-hold on it until
it "sticks" to your mouse cursor, then carry it over to the hotkey
window and "drop" it on one of the button slots there.

To switch pages on the hotkey window, either use the little
"left arrow/right arrow" buttons on the top, or more efficiently
hit "shift-#" (where # is 1 through 0) on your keyboard, and
it'll instantly flip to page "#" on the hotkey window.

People generally set up different pages for different scenarios
(e.g., I have "travel" hotkeys like /loc and Sense Heading and
/corpse on page 1, "combat" hotkeys like Taunt and "Incoming"
on page 3, emergency hotkeys like Lay Hands on page 6, etc.)
Also, you can copy the same macro to several different pages,
if that makes things more convenient.

So when I'm in combat mode, I hit shift-3 to go to my combat
hotkeys, then generally stay there for a while and use the
10 hotkeys I've set up for fighting.  When I travel to a
different zone, I hit shift-1 and use my traveling hotkeys, etc.

After a while you also get pretty good at "combination"
keystrokes, like any time I need Lay Hands suddenly,
I reflexively hit "shift-6, 2" without even thinking about
"let's see, now I have to change to hotkey page 6, then..." --
instead, "shift-6 2" is just the key combo that my fingers
"know" triggers Lay Hands.  Other "page flip, hotkey" combos
become second-nature too if you need them a lot.

And it's a heck of a lot more convenient than mouse-clicking.  :-)
