LOL - me too.  I was given a 'Royal Picture' as a quest reward, and
when placed it was upside down.  I /bugged it, and forgot about it.

A few days later I was placing a new bed, and found I could rotate it
using the mouse - I assume it would have worked on pics, but forgot to
try it.

I'd like an option in the graphics menu for your room/house settings -
I have to be careful with lights and shadows in the gameworld, but
could probably turn on multiple lightsources and shadow while in my
apartment, and get the full effect of the lights and mirrors, etc.

One more thing to suggest come retail.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
