Hehe, if i had done that, you would have been able to hear my screams 
worldwide. Took me over a week to get the 5 biles.

Since you only need to be level 12 to make the vials, the easiest way would 

probably be to make a chanter yourself and get him to leve 12.


If you dont wanna waste time on that, do what i did when i needed vials.
Have vials and pearls on yoo. Go to EC or WC, do a /who ENCHANTER (hehe, 
actaully kinda sad we tailors have to do like this, when i know how 
bothersome it is for my druid when beggers find me with a /who), see if 
you can find some between 12-16.
Im a druid, so can easily get the spell, so if they didnt have the 
spell, i went and got it for them (free of course). Then I payed 2pp pr 
cast.
Yes, 2pp isnt much, but for a untwinked/first char chanter, being able 
to make 80pp in around 1 hour is great income. When i was done with Wu i 
had a list of 6 chanters i just had to ask to get some vials done.
