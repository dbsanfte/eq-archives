Some people say True North is useless.  No, it's perfect for
practicing Divination.  :-)  It has a low mana cost, and a fast
recast time.  The next time you're standing around waiting for
something, start chain-casting True North.  Your Divination will
get to a decent level pretty quickly.

Before I maxed all my casting skills, I had a special page
of my spellbook dedicated to the five newbie-ish spells that were
the best for practicing Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration,
Divination, and Evocation.  Whenever I had free time and mana,
I'd mem them and start casting.

Helpful tip:  You can practice undead spells on the corpses
of the undead, or even on a nearby necromancer's pet.  That
way you don't need to find a fresh undead critter for each
attempt.

That's not an exploit at all.  If you want to finish off a mob
*slower* than you could with your best weapon, that's hardly
exploiting anything, even if you are gaining weapon skills while
it runs.

And a lot of people use your technique, including myself.

And that's not exploiting either.

Two of the usual signs of an exploit are either finding a way to
do something without risk that is supposed to entail risk, or
finding a way to do something faster than players are supposed
to be able to accomplish it.

Your technique has neither of those problems.  You still have
the ordinary risk of fighting a creature, because it could run
into its friends and aggro them, or wanderers could jump you
as you fiddle with the hurt one.  In fact, you have *more*
risk because you're spending more time juggling it, you'd be
safer overall just killing it quickly and spending your time
getting ready for the next fight.  Similarly, you're not
doing anything faster than designed, you're killing the gnoll
*slower*, and getting weapon skill increases (per swing) no
faster than designed.

But you weren't really gaining anything from it.  As long as you
were making him just ping-pong back and forth, you couldn't
benefit.  You could only get weapon skills increases (or exp)
after you had re-engaged it and started whacking on it again.

There's no exploit in just watching a running mob run, even if
they are running in circles.
