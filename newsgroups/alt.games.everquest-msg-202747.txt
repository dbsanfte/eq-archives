Excellent solo classes by comparison.   And while there are good soloers out
there, I would argue that a great deal of thier ability was something that
Sony really didn't forsee, even if they should have.  Kiting for example.  I
just think that they didn't consider the obvious results of giving a class
ranged attacks and the ability to outrun most mobs.   IMO, probably only the
pet classes were really intended to solo, and not all that well.  As well as
a mage pet soloing, not a necromancer fear kiting.

And I very much doubt that bard swarm kiting was anything they imagined in
thier worst nightmares, until they noticed the first bard doing it.   From
the pure amount of group benefits given to the bard class... nearly every
song, I think it's obvious they were meant to be group only, even if players
have somehow found a way to solo them incredibly efficiently.

To some degree, yes.  Things like the DoT un-nerf show that, a reversal of
one of their earliest attempts to slow down kiting (as the main strategy of
soloing).  But IMO other things, like the new "insanely high group bonus"
show that they haven't really abandoned their agenda, just their tactics.
They're using the carrot now, instead of the stick.

I honestly don't know this, but I'd wager that at the moment it's a lot
lower than it was a few days ago.   KEI was (probably) skewing the numbers
pretty heavily towards the solo side.   IMO, one of the reasons they really
did lower the boom on it.
