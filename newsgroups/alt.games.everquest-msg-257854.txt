Why shouldn't they? If one runs off to get Temp in PoK, they're likely 
gonna be paying for it. No way anyone should ever be offended by a cleric 
who requires them to cover the cost of Temp. Why should the cleric have to 
foot the bill for everyone?

Right, a cleric should sit in the back while the melee's play loot whore 
and *then* pay for the dots to drop Temp on them as well. I don't think so.
