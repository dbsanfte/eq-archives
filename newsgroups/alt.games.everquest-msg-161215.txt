Only the cleric can get in to the exp portions of the planes, and he's
frankly a bit young to find groups; although a savvy pickup group would
recruit him for yard trash as he'll cost less exp, and you can "bring
your own" group and do quite well, the exp bonus is amazing.

Your cleric will also find a new buff he can use to decrease spell
casting times (two actually but both do the same thing and the effect
doesn't stack) and I suspect your druid will find something as well.. the
necro might not, I know the lowest level new bard song seems to be 42,
even though the lowest level cleric spell was 19

The ports... well your druid might not care too much, but if your other
characters are on the same account, the ports are priceless to a lower
level character.  Sadly my 62 cleric doesn't get much use out of them as
there's little reason to venture out of the planes, and those reasons all
involve doing stuff with the guild, which means a porter is provided.
For my bard, though, the increase in freedom is astonishing, its very
little short of suddenly being given the ability to port self.
