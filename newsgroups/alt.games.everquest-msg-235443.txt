What's a "normal" player?  There are confirmed drops of the turnin
components (Taelosian Geomancy Stone) and spells themselves in the
sewers of Barindu.  My 19AA, very pre-elemental BL and 69 AA very
pre-elemental mage with a 34 aa wizard, 71 aa, 8khp warrior and 
our druid and cleric did just fine down there.  We are decidedly
"normal".  That was w/o my 65% slow too.
