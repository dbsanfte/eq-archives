Actually, my character is a Cleric, and he's after the Bayle List from out
of Mammoth in Surefall Glade.  (the Bone Thunderstaff Quest).  I have a
tendancy to solo my cleric from time to time, and the anti-undead proc on
that staff sounds like something I could use.

Spent all last night killing green minotaurs...got good faction, but not
enough to get myself out of apprehensive.

I have myself bound in High Hold Pass so I can Gate back and forth part of
the way for the trip and do mail runs for pocket change.  The rumors I've
heard about Meldrath (or whatever that necro's name is that I'm taking
faction hits with whenever I kill a minotaur) makes me think I should bind
in Ak'anon :-)

Second Question....what level of faction do I need to be to get the
Regurgationic?  Will Indifferent suffice?
