ooc for someone to get your corpse
maybe if you scored a sow you coul drag it to zone
You might even be able to achieve this with strafe running.
You could create a lvl 1 necro to drag it (use invis vs undead). just
/consent your necro
Anyway, if you die once and get it dragged a bit youre problem is solved.
I could drag it for you if youre on druzzil ro
