Stores do this all the time. Sony/Verant has nothing to do with the
change in price.

Ever hear of a "Loss Leader". It is common for stores to take a loss
on an item in the hope that you will buy other items at the same time.

Durring Thanksgiving and X-mas many supermarkets will give you a free
turkey if you spend $50-100 in groceries. Why? Because you will most
likely buy stuffing, potatoes, pie mix, etc, etc, etc all that the
regular price (or even a slightly higher one). The store still makes a
profit in the long run, and customer leaves happy thinking they got
something for nothing.

Best Buy and Curcuit City expect you to buy more than just EQ:SoL. It
is X-mas time after all. So they offer a very popular game at half the
normal cost hoping you will do some X-mas shopping while you are
there.


Cheers
