Sure, all the tricks my berserker uses to do the same job.  But 
consider, a single hunting trip to Dulak costs me a SOW and Cloudy, 
thats 18pp, plus returning, SOW, Cloudy, Levitation; well honestly I 
haven't been using levitation but -should-.  So thats what, 28pp for the 
return trip?  46, almost 50pp spent in order to go hunt somewhere and 
come home, compared to the nothing at all that a druid or shaman or 
ranger or beastlord would spend (having all the above tools), the 20pp 
that other non SOW casters would spend... and my mage didn't bother with 
the SOW potion because he has 10 minute never break early invis, several 
other classes have this too I think.
