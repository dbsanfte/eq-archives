The fundamental rift between TwoHead and myself is that I believe a tactic
is innocent until proven an exploit.  Furthermore, I think that the rules
of conduct sufficiently explain how the game is to be played and that they
should be ammended if new rules violations are identified.  Despite
TwoHead's assertion to the contrary, that is very doable.

Both of the above tactics are clever and by no means easy.  If they work
(which is highly questionable), and the player can manage to avoid being
killed by the guard in question, and get xp, he has demonstrated
creativity and deft spell use. While the player didn't stand toe to toe
with the mob and bludgeon it to death, he has done work to kill it.

As far as I can see, no one in this thread has cited an actual incident of
a player being disciplined for guard-centric tactics.  TwoHead claims to
know of disciplinary incidents of some flavor (not necessarily the flavors
above), but he gives no details and cites no references.

When the EQ manual suggests the tactic of luring to guards, why would we
suppose that the above tactics are exploits?  How is using a guard to take
health off a mob different from charming another mob to do same?

Let's assume that for some bizarre reason a GM does think these tactics
are exploits.  The rules of conduct do not identify them as such.
Therefore, the worst that would happen to a player employing them (the
first time) would be a warning.  At which point, it would be great if the
player would post here and give us the details.  And if Verant ammended
the rules.
