We checked last night by doing one woe/envy cycle, he is still max
ally. He got the epic a LONG time ago.. so apparently the hit is
recent. I'll con the spirit after I get mine.. we were going to do it
last night, but by the time guild was done with Trakanon and Velketor
(they were up.. we had to..) it was 3am and too late to get mine.
Maybe tonight :)
