Not trying to sound offensive or anything... but you guys are blasting this
guy without realizing the pathetically obvious -- he is either "Yantis" or
hired by "Yantis" advertising the plat sales.

I mean, look at it.  He makes a point of telling us all where we can find
this guy.  Every single post he writes makes a point of how "Yantis" is
selling millions of plat dirt-cheap.  He says this pisses him off but in the
same breath makes this huge issue out of HOW MUCH plat the guy's got and HOW
CHEAP it is, and how if he had the money, he would buy it all too, and how
we should all go check this guy out (to see how wrong and disgusting this
business is, of course).  And as an added bonus he points out how expensive
everything is, which we know to be true (who among us hasn't seen some uber
piece of gear in the bazaar and desperately wanted it but not been able to
afford it?), giving us yet another incentive to go and buy "Yantis"'s plat.
His thread title is "Yantis and his billions of super cheap EQ plat"... add
some "!!!"s onto that and it's a tailor-made email/usenet spam ad header.
He even points out that his friend are all telling him to go and buy this
plat before it's gone, can't tell me you haven't heard that advertising
gimmick before.  "Buy it quick, we know you'd like to take the time to think
about whether you really want it, but you don't have that luxury!  Supplies
are limited!  If you wait until tomorrow to think about it, it will all be
gone and you'll have lost the chance forever!  So buy it, even though you're
pretty sure you'll decide it was a waste of money, because on the off chance
you actually decide you like it, you'll sure hate yourself then, won't
you?!"  And he manages to capture our attention by pretending he's disgusted
and offended by this plat trade, so that we'll spend our time calling him an
idiot, while all the while reading again and again about "Yantis"s super
cheap easy EQ plat!!, in the hope that we'll start having sneaking little
thoughts about, "Wow... ya know... it *would* be kind of nice to have that
much plat... and it's less than $250... I can afford that... and nobody here
will know I went and bought it... hmm...."  Which I'm sure has happened to
at least a few posters here already, and I'll bet you anything this "BigBoy"
has gotten Yantis a nice chunk of business already.
