Hail, friends and fellow adventurers. My wife and I have recently returned
to this world after being gone for a very long time (before the discovery of
Kunark). I am Shaman of the northern climes and my wife is Summerbreeze,
Warrior of the Six Hammers. We have just this night attained our 17th season
and there is much to learn about the strange world we have entered.

A few questions:

1) I desire to keep within range of my wife and not exceed her level even
though I spend far more time adventuring than she. This suits me fine, for
it allows me to spend much extra time exploring, smelling the roses,
training skills and such, and focusing less on the combat until she can join
me. My casting skills are quite easy to fully max at each season, but my
combat skills require a worthy challenge in order to increase. My question
is, will my combat skills increase at the same rate fighting light blues as
they would fighting dark blues or whites? I would prefer to fight the light
blues to sharpen the skills without gaining on my wife.

2) It seems that the first time that I cast a Healing spell it has little to
no effect on my partner's health bar and I see the improvements take place
starting with the 2nd casts and beyond. Is this an anomaly of the system, a
huge coincidence, or have I hit my head too hard on a wooly mammoth tusk?

3) I have strange and powerful majicks that require replenishment in the
form of "meditation". I note that health and mana seem to regenerate faster
when I sit, whether meditating or not. Does pulling up the spell book while
sitting increase the mana regeneration or does the effect of simply sitting
accomplish the same thing?

4) As an enterprising new Shaman, I hope to seek out the trade of my people:
Alchemy. Will the potions that I am able to create exceed, match or fall
short of the spells that I and others can cast? If they fall short or match,
the advantages would seem minimal and subtle. I would hope they would exceed
any alternatives, but that's the Shaman in me talking.

Thanks to the Citizens of this forum for entertaining my questions. I will
see you on the battlefield!
