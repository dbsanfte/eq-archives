Hi all,

  I hope someone here can help me.  I've built, upgraded,
troubleshot,networked, etc. many a system (not professionally, but I do a
lot of computer work for people out of my house as a side gig) and my kids'
system is %#(@ing me over big time.
  Every once in awhile the CD drive just starts to die.  It reads CD's when
it wants to, and only when it wants to.  I've replace the ide cable many
times, in fact, this is the 3rd CD player in this system as a result of this
problem.  The first drive that did this to me finally stopped working and I
replaced it.  New one worked fine but within a few months same thing.
Replace it and it works fine.  Now the 3rd one is crapping out again...
  I've tried replacing ide cables, different drivers of all types of flavors
(latest manufacturer, generic, etc.).  Oh yeah, when I take the drives out,
I throw them into another system to test.  They don't work!
  At first I thought the IDE controller on the motherboard might be dying,
but the hard disk on the same cable is working absolutely fine.
  Could something on the system be frying my CD drives over time?  I don't
think this is logical, but I can't seem to find any other reason for this to
be happening.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, for as I write this, I have a 4 and 5
year old screaming at me to get it working and they don't accept "Sorry,
Daddy is a complete failure" as an excuse.

Yes, their CD's are fairly scratched and occasionally develop sticky slime
on the reading surface, but after a good cleaning they will play in any of
my systems except this one.  They will soon inherit my system, but I would
like to solve this for my own sanity...

Laying in fetal position crying,
SEAN...
