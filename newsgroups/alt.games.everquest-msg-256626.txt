i was in the same boat not too long ago.  it's probably been about 6 months
since i started my playing eq.  i started with a necro on FV.

well, i s'pose you could go through all that time reading everything and
talking to every NPC you find, but, in my opinion, there's nothing better
than just jumping in and seeing what you can do on your own.  when i
started, i had no idea what the hell i was doing.  it took me till level 3
or 4 before i relized i had more level 1 spells than what the game started
me out with.  it took me till level 15 or 20 before i knew what the "find"
button did (just never clicked it).  up till about a month ago i was still
confused about what all the little buttons in the window selector did, but i
learned as i went and now i'd say i'm pretty good.  at least, i can out
necro many of my friends.  most of the stuff in the game is pretty easy to
figure out.  if you want something to happen just type "/whatever you want
to happen" and half the time it works.  and if you are really having a hard
time with something just ooc (or shout if you're on FV) in pok, if you don't
get an answer there, head to the bazaar where theres about 5 times as many
people, someone will know the answer.

i like to learn by experience.  it takes a little longer before you get
everything down, but at least you can do more than just talk to NPC's and
read tutorials. all a matter of preferance, though....
