True 2 years ago with OoW - L70 runes pretty much only dropped in zones that
were only populated by raid-equipped groups.  Pretty close to true a year ago,
when DoDH spells required rather high-end groups to complete.  Nodrop spells
just plain suck.

I'm delighted that the new expansion has ALL spells for sale on vendors, with
slight upgrades (rank 2 version) available to high-end groups and better
upgrades (rank 3) to raids.  And at least rank 2 are droppable/sellable, so
they'll be common as the expansion ages.  Unsure of rank 3.

I suspect there are a LOT of players who've been playing for years that have
never cared where Field of Bone is.
