Eh.  The game has changed a lot.  The biggest nerf to enchanters was 
probably making paci-type spells actually -work-.  So many times I get a 
group lately, and they do nothing but single pull, and I end up wondering 
why I'm even here?  Just to refresh voq/vq and send my weenie pet to do 
some damage?  Whee... If I'm lucky, maybe they'll let me charm something, 
but that's oh-so-rare.

Gone are the days of Seb, and people screwing up and training us, and me 
getting to actually use some skill to CC 11 mobs at once.  So glad my 
warrior is getting up to a useful level.  Now I can insist on (a) having 
an enchanter, and (b) pulling, and some other enchanter gets to actually 
have some fun. :)

/Agree.  A 55 enchanter is almost completely useless in PoV.  Wait'll they 
reach 61, and can actually mezz something once in a while.  If you're 
considering a cleric to be a caster, sure, I'd consider a 55 cleric in 
PoV.  Heals don't get resisted much. :)

For 55-60, Velk's is an awesome place, and much less crowded than it once 
was.  Ditto Seb.  Ya just gotta convince people it's worth the trek -all 
that long way there-.  Lazy bastards.
