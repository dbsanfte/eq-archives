Was coming back from LGuk not long after getting to level 39, and had all my
spells except for the one you can only get in Velious.  I was on my to
Freeport, and had a friend coming from Velious on their way to LGuk, so we
met in SRo where I could get the spell form her.  Got my spell, was about to
head off when I checked the time - 5pm game time.  I had heard this rumour
(how true I don't know) that killing the undead in the tower at 6pm game
time will usually result in an AC spawn that night.  Well, I had half an
hour to kill so I thought 'what the heck'.  So I killed the undead in the
tower (crypt mummy btw) at 6pm, then just ran around, killing any undead
that might come my way (but not really trying to find them).

Most people just seemed to be passing through, as no character seemed to
stay in the zone that long, many of them I recognised from LGuk, obviously
also heading for FP.  (this was early morning US time - I live in Australia
so it was afternoon here).  After about 10min I saw a Sand Giant, and
targeting him revealed it was Mr. Hasam.  Not bad I thought, at least I will
get the Kilij plans I had wanted about 20 lvls ago :-).  Do the quest for
fun and then give the Brazen Brass Kilij to a newbie friend or something.
So I bring him down, and then heal and med up.  I thought, I will do one
more check, so I run to north of the zone, kill a couple of undead that
cross my path, get some serious lag, then start back to the Derv camp on the
west wall.

Nearly there when over the rise I see the form another 'Sand Giant'.  Target
him and 'Ancient Cyclops' shows in the target box!  I was so shocked I ran
straight into him without turning auto-attack on!  Well, started fighting,
activated my new spell (Divine Purpose - surprising it didn't get
interupted), I was sitting on the edge of my seat shaking the whole time.
Relief flooded me when he got to below half way.

We were both to about 2 bubs left when I lagged - I nearly had a heart
attack!  'NOOOOOOO' I thought I was a goner -either he would kill me, or I
would go LD (or worse, both ).  But when the lag stopped and I saw I hadn't
lost much health, I nearly shouted for joy, was able to deal enough damage
after that to get him running before I had to use LoH (Divine Purpose would
have helped).  Slay the brute, then go to loot, just as this bloomin' dune
tarantula wanders throught the battlefield and twice I end up conning the
thing trying to loot =/.  Finally looted, got my Ring of the Ancients.

Blow me down if two seconds later the only other person in the zone just
shows up (didn't realise I had just killed the AC, I found out later).  He
needed escorting to Oasis, did that, then 10 people all of a sudden show up
in Sro.  So I got it just in time!

So now I am off to get my jboots, not bad for the amount of time I spent,
any longer and I would've forgotten it.  Whether the undead killing at 6pm
was a factor obviously I don't know.  It may have even helped to spawn
Hasam, who then spawned the AC.  All speculation of course.  Not that I'm
really worried now :-).

Well, just thought I'd share my experience, and good luck to all you AC
campers!
