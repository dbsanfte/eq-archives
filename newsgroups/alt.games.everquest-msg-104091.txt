I was using my Bard's levitation song to get on top of buildings
in Freeport so I could sightsee.

I noticed that the marble-like roof over the north end of the
Arena was the highest point in West Freeport, so after
experimenting a bit I managed to get on top of it and get a
great "I can see for miles" overview of West Freeport.

Then I tried to get back off...

It turns out that for some reason or another, there's an invisible
barrier around the roof of the W.FP Arena -- you can get in, but
you can't get back out.  What's really odd is that it's larger 
than the roof by about 20 feet on all sides.  What's even stranger 
is that there's also an invisible "shelf" which prevents you from 
dropping down to ground level as you walk off the roof and step 
out into space before hitting the invisible wall.  I could stand
in mid-air ten feet out from the roof and walk around as if
on a sheet of glass.

I experimented for a good twenty minutes, and found absolutely
no way to escape the roof.  Not even the Bard's Shadow Step song
could blip me out of the "box".

I petitioned for assistance, but before the Guide responded 
a Wizard friend passed through W.FP and she got close
enough under me to be able to xloc me out of the zone.

Bizarre.
