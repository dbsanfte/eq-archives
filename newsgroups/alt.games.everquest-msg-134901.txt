That's made me think that a nice addition to the bazzar code would be to
be able to set a price decay on your stock.

E.g. Sell My Uber Spell for 20k, but take off 1k every 3 real time
hours.

That way you could (almost) guarentee all your stock selling and not
have to keep updateing prices etc.

Thougths ?

Perhaps put a lower limit in ?
Perhaps alow advanced decay (Drop 10% ever xxx) ?

Would be nice.

Jim
