I've often wished all cars could start at the same time like you describe, 
like in that Tom Cruise movie (I think it was Minority Report) where all 
the vehicular traffic was pre-plotted and automated with no driving 
necessary (of course they also drove up and down the sides of buildings, 
too, which was pretty cool).

You see that effect in heavy traffic on the highways also. I call it the 
"caterpillar" effect.
