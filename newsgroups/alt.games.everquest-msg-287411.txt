If you stick to the hot zones, it's certainly possible to find/start a
group, though chances of full groups are often slim. I would say it's
easier to group as you get to the mid to upper levels, as these days
the lower levels just don't require a group. Most of the lower level
players are at least fairly well-twinked, so they just plow through
the levels, not worrying about grouping until later, when it becomes
more a necessity.

It's like I've seen from all the latest MMORPG's that have come along
over the last few years - if people don't need to group, chances are
they won't bother with it.

My brother and I have been back playing EQ for a while, but we're
going to try Vanguard for a bit. I had played it during the first
month or so after launch, but it was just way to buggy at the time.
I'm hoping that in its first year the devs have been able to stabilize
it a bit. I still think it's just a beautiful game, better than EQ2,
IMO.
