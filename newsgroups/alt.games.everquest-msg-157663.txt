One of the big draw cards of enchanter (imo anyway) is dire charm. You can
permanently charm a mob up to about level 46. getting a group these days as
an enchanter isnt so easy. Verant have created a 150 minute clarity 3 spell,
so many groups already have it and dont need an enchanter. I thought
enchanters were needed for haste too, but apparently not.

Druids have it really good at the moment. We get a clarity spell (6/tic) at
level 59, and a kind of complete heal at level 58. Its not quite a CH, but
in just about every group ive been in, its been the equivelant.

Clerics have got a couple of new spells to make them "battle clerics", but i
dont think this makes up for them not being needed in groups now, since
druids and shammies can heal really well. A druid or a shammy is probably a
better choice for a group these days, so long as you have rezzes covered,
and thats not a problem usualy. Someone around to rez usually, or someone
has an alt cleric.

Bard get a very cool aoe mana song. Not sure on the level but its high
50''s. Great for raids. bard is one of the least played classes on our
server.

Running fast is something all characters get to do after 51 now. You can
assign you xp to "alternate abilities", one of which is enhanced run speed.

If you like grouping, then rogues are a class that there never seem to be
enough of, at least on our server.
