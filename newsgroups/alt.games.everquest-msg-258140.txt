I have run into a dead end with a quest - talk to GM cant give any info,
searched all the boards lots of people reached the same point, the quests
suggests it carry's on further yet no one appear to have do so and there is
no information

Is there anywhere I can get official confirmation that the quest continues
or is not finished by the game makers - I dont want the answer just
confirmation....

Thanks :)
