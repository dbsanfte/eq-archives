Alright, does this sound like an African-themed place, or possibly
something else? There's enough zones there for 2 continents (compared
to Odus or Velious).

Also, with the toggle tribute window, are we going to need to make
tributes to advance (ala Velious) or is this a new way to give quest
npc's items ( as items are tributable also).  Lots of possibilites
either way.

So Berserker's start in Nedaria's landing?  Nice zone, but there's no
a lot next to it currently, and there'd have to be some other
connection.  Going through Jaggedpine effectively closes it for some
time to a lot of races.  Or is starting in Nedaria's only a Human
option?

A simple little thing, very nice though.  Five the player some
feedback to what their character is doing. Shouda been in on day 1.

Raid Leadership points purchased the same way as AA's.  Something to
do once you've reached 300AA's or so.  It does seem like it will
become self-fulfilling rapidly though.. People are raid-leader's
because they have a high # of raid XP's and abilitie's so they get
more.  Unless you can shuffle you own raid xp towards raid points as
well, it may soon become 'locked out' for many people.

Also, not quite sure on the /lexpgive thing.  Does this mean we can
shuffle out xp around, doling it out where needed, or does all raid xp
go to person?  It is going to create yet another 'coin of the realm',
in much the same way LDoN Adventure points are, but I'm curious as to
how this will work.

Nice, How does this break down into General, Archetype, Class, though.
