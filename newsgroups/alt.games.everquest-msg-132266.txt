They have actually addressed even this problem to some degree, in that one
item can end up on your cursor now, but it is still possible to have the
problem if you are showing things that you are wearing or wielding.  If you
always only show one item, you should never have a problem, as worst case,
it will now end up on your cursor, ready to be placed in whatever slot you
want.
