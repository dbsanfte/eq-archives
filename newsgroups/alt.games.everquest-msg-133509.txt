My cleric and shaman don't ever have gate up, period. (both 60)
If I was in an exp group and somebody gated on us I doubt I'd ever group
with them again

In my experiences, getting back to the combat area is neigh on impossible.
And whilst it's all good and well your alive, full mana, didn't lose any EXP
or sacrifice yourself.. what use are you to the now wiped raid?

Few examples (to show its not just upper end raids)
Trakanon (seb),  Master Yael(the hole), Scalekeeper(the hole), Doze, Kael
Arena (past the see invis), Dain (past the kos golems and tenticles), Yeli
(not a death trap, just 30min run), Zlandikar, NToV, Doze/telk, TiV, Shei,
THO, Burrower, Rhag 2/AL/Creator, Burrower, Greig

If you gate on one of these raids, how you going to get back in the combat
and rezzing people?

Heck, add PoF and PoH to this, even PoA if you were coffin'ed to a certain
isle.  Chardok royals, Sebilis Juggs. Sleepers Tomb.. the list could go on
and on

Basically if nobody camps out on these raids, your summoning to the
zoneline.  And for every gating cleric, thats a guaranteed failure of being
able to rez people in.  Heck even if you can't camp out, you can put a rez
box on a dead cleric or 2 (who don't click yes till the all clear,
obviously)

Which raids/zones/mobs has this been the case tho?
