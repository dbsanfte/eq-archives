Yeah, *damn* them for investing capital in other countries,
and providing products/services that people in those countries
want to buy!  Damn them all to hell!

You know, this "imperialism via trade" paranoia is so laughably
misguided that it'd be funny if it weren't sadly the root
behind a lot of dangerously misguided policies.

From the last "earth first" kumbaya-athon there are a lot
of hair-raisingly idiotic and callous quotes from speakers
who seriously put forth such ideas that we ought to leave
third world peoples in the prior century (or two or three)
because it would be sad to "lose their culture" by bringing
them such imperialistic impositions as electricity, running
water, and crops that could prevent famine.
