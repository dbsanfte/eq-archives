I haven't seen any posts of this elsewhere yet, so thought I'd post it.
Magister on Erollisi Marr awakened the sleeper on Saturday night.  Here is a
link to what info I have seen:
http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdr...=1&stop=20

I was playing at the time, but not in Velious, others in my guild were
closer, and/or chatting with some Magister members at the time.  This is
what, the third server now?  Rathe, Mithaniel Marr, and now Erollisi Marr.
