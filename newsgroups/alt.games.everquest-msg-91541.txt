And if the servers are bought down for a normal scheduled patch, what server is
going to be the one to give you the message that they are down? Especially since
the patch and login servers are the very servers bought down for a patch?

Also, I know I read the EULA every time I log in. I guess you do to. Every
signal time you log in. Did you not see in the EULA on Sunday night that it was
changed and said that there was going to be a scheduled patch downage on Monday?
I know I did. If you truly read the EULA, you would have know that, as well. ;)
