I've just reached 39 myself. I did the low 30s in Rathe, mid 30s in Sol A or
B (forget which -- the lower level one), and the last couple of levels in
GD. I rarely had much trouble finding a group, and certainly Rathe is the
best place to earn cash in the 30s. At GD, if no groups were available for
me, I just zoned to EW and sometimes found one there. GD has much more
convenient banking than Rathe. Since the giants and the tizmaks drop lots of
velium weapons which the vendors pay several plat each for, I found it
rivaling Rathe for cash earnings per hour. Also GD is a very busy zone, I
made good money from all the people offering cash for 50% rezzes.
