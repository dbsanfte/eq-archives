    It's always easier to adjust difficulty back down later than it is to
continue to beef it up. And the shit Furor was stirring up on his site was
getting people very riled up.

    Blazzax was always nasty, but this is absolutely over-the-top. Even FoH
is whining about this one.

    That's assuming these mobs still drop elemental armour. One of the
things the FoH crew wanted was expanded loot tables, so they wouldn't get
more elemental armour that was just going to rot anyways. I imagine that's
next on the agenda, which means the chances of geting elemental molds and
patterns will be all shot to hell.

    The charm chickens are still doable, since the length between charms is
now two minutes and they were never dangerous in melee anyways. Start with
them, and see if they still drop junk or not. If they're dropping the same
old sleeves and shoulders, then see if you can handle the stuff in Air. The
minis there drop about the best stuff any mini named drops, and the rings
are pretty straightforward (clear islands to get mini boss to pop, kill mini
boss to get boss to pop). Those bosses aren't so tough, for the most part,
and the loot is certainly elemental quality. In the meantime, farm the
living hell out of BoT, Sol Ro's Tower, Tactics, and Vex Thal. Those four
zones have a lot of stuff that is close to elemental quality, and should
gear you up to a very high degree.
