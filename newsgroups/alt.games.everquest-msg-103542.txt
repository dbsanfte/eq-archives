No Ben, I am concerned about you now.  I really had no idea you were so
bad off and I regret forcing you to face things that you are not ready
to face.  It appears to me that you are posting from the Calgary Alberta
area.  I found this link to a clinic in that area that may be able to
help you deal with your problems.  If you don't get help there,  please
get help somewhere before your family has to file a lawsuit  against me
for pushing you over the edge.

Good luck and get better.
