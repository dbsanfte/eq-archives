I play a 55 monk on brell.  After level 30 or so there just isnt any reason
at all to hang out near Qeynos.  A few isolated mobs (ogre camps, corrupted
guards etc)  but no decent dungeons.  Freeport on the other hand still has
Sol A and B, Najena a little lower and is a transportation hub considering
the BB, Velious and Kunark (overthere) boats nearby.   I'd strongly recommend
Freeport over Qeynos.
