No.
OH but wait a second.. I think I just understood what you are saying.
You are saying you have not bought the system YET and that at this
point you could CHOOSE to get either 512 meg ddr ram or sdram?
I guess in that case it depends on how much more the ddr ram adds to
the cost. Am i correct in assuming the athalon would then be 266 mhz
bus instead of 133? If its like these prices of an outlet place near
me:

OEM/LD/MT  512MB 168pin SDRAM 133Mhz  
 $79.00 
 
OEM/LD/MT  512MB 184pins DDR 266  
 $159.00
 
You are roughly spending twice as much or more for the ddr ram.
I think what you need to do is find a game site with benchmarks, there
are several out there and compare the exact issue you are considering.
Also you should note that the performance increase benchmarked in
their favorite app to BM, quake 3 or something, will not really be
compareable to Everquest. Quake 3 is mainly a small area and raw
processing power/moving of polygons more than amount of ram at a
certain point.

Everquest mostly just needs raw memory and it doesn't matter what type
since it loads all those models and the textures of the zone you are
in to memory as much as it can. Once in memory, a higher mhz bus speed
is not really going to make a diff. You'd likely be better off getting
768 meg sdram in a system for everquest instead of 512 meg ddr ram if
the price difference made 768 ram just as good a choice (or better
even)  Sdram is still pretty standard and low cost and is not going
anywhere anytime soon.
