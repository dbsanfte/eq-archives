The easiest (and cheapest) is to work on the next thing to become
trivial. Look at the recipes at EQTRaders http://www.eqtraders.com and
search for skilling guides on the internet. Basically, these follow the
above advice, but tell you where you can buy stacks of stuff from
merchants.

With newbie characters, before selling my loot, I take out basic
smithing (rusties), tailoring (ruined pelts), brewing (fishing grubs),
etc and doo a little bit as I level.

You do have the first point?

I've found that skill up tends to happen in patches. Like any skill you
really need to just do it a bit at a time, but whenever I see other
skills upping, I tend to hit the sense heading, foraging, hide, etc keys
at the same time. Really frustrating at times anyway.
