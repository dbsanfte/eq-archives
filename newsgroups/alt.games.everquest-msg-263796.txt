The voiceovers have been disappointing to me.  The accents are very
stereotypical and sound like someone doing impressions in a B-grade scifi
flick.  There is no character to them.  I'm going to give beta a couple more
tries before I pass the account to a friend who may make better use of it.
I'm so bored, but my highest level character is only 7.  I'd like to get him
higher so I can have a more complete view of the game, but he's got a bunch
of quests that I'm completely disinterested in.  He was walking through
Qeynos yesterday and I thought, "This is immersion?"  A lot of wide open,
empty space with NPC's generally just standing around with blank stares.
The only NPC's who show any life are the guards who march around a bit.  I
walked into a tavern and saw the barkeeper just standing there along with
the waitress.  Some drunkard said he was sloshed or somesuch, might have
begged for a little money, and left, but that was it.  It would have been so
much nice if the waitress was busy going from table to table and when I saw
a blacksmith he was actually pounding out things on an anvil.
