I run EQ on 3 laptops
1. old dell inspiron 5000, pentium III 700 MHz, 384M of RAM, not sure
about the video card. I use that for my bazaar mule. 640 x 480
resolution , clip plane 5%, he can run around with traders hiding. I
take him out to pok once in a while. he can move around. I have not
battled with for a while , but I was post luclin, but with models
removed
2. a Fujitsu lifebook, pendium M probably 1.6G, 512 M memory, shared
video card. After turning off the antivirus, runs like a champ. i dont
have all the video effects (shadow, far clip plane for effects etc) but

i get thru pok, battle, zone, etc as good as my desk top (1024 x 768)
3. a toshiba laptop, 512M memory, 1.8G Pentium IV (i believe), nvidia
integratde video card. runs eq fine, gave us the most problems due to
unsupported video drivers from toshiba. with the release of
directx9.0c, things cleared up. pok, bazaar, battle, all good with
reduced (800 x 600)

so "eq cant run on laptops" ..bull. maybe not as great as a twinked
desktop but certainly functioning
