I have just started an Iksar Monk, which I am liking to this point (only had
time to get to LV3, didn't have much playing time before work).  But I do
have some questions as to how the skills work?

How long do I have to wait between attempts at using MEND?
HOW do I use MEND?
How do I use safe fall?
When I get other combat abilities they will show up in combat abilities
(like KICK does) right?
Should I keep skills up with a 1HS, or any other weapon or should I wait a
little longer?
I've saved most of my practice points, just after hitting LV3 I've still got
11 of them.  Is this good?  What will I want to be saving them for?
Any other newbie monk advice?
