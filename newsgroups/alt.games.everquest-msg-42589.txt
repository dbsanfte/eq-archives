Starting with level 51, all you have left are Hell levels. It's also
when gear really starts to matter. Here's one idea:

Level to 51 and then take a break from leveling. Seek out greens with
good loot or drops you can sell. Do quests for things you can use.
Hang out in those blue/green dungeons with nice drops waiting for a
group.

In a few weeks you should have some nice upgrades and had a lot of fun
getting them. You'll be closer to 52 than you think you would be.
You'll also be more powerful when you return to playing the post 50
game which you should now enjoy more (nobody enjoys getting their ass
kicked, right?)
