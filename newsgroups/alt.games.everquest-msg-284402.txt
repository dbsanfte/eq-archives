Where there are people, there will be people talking about sex.  People 
use every medium in existence to do it.

Every time a new form of communication is 'invented', some of the 
earliest adopters are those who want to talk about sex.

It's the way of the world.

EQ has everything you need to avoid this issue,

/ignore
/report
/petition

Sony will eventually deal with people who breach their EULA, but someone 
who says 'hey, I wondered if you wanted to cyb0rz' isn't quite there.
