There is no "guard me" button or command.  There is only /pet guard,
which tells it to stop following you and to stand in place.  It will
attack anything that attacks you in either mode.  The only difference
is that if you get far enough away, it will not agro on your attacker
until you bring the attacker within a certain range of the pet.

By default, commandable (is that a word?) pets are in follow mode. 
Follow mode is not the same as guard mode.
