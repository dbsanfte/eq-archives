First thing outfit yourself in regular leather armor. A full set of
leather only costs about 30pp and some ac is better than none.
Then auction to buy some gold jasper earrings.

Next I would try and find a high skilled halfling tailor, just auction that
you are looking for one. See if they will make some Vale studded
leather armor for you if you bring them the ingredients, some will
charge, some will do it for free. Then go hunt the skulking brutes in
Warsliks Woods and get the brute hides for the armor. You especially
want the arms, legs, cloak and boots. This is decent druid armor.

Go to this site to see the ingredients you will need to give the tailor:

The brutes should still give you some exp at 29 and are easy kills,
they drop decent loot as well.
