Probably not difficult at all. Just instantly remove your character from
the world the second LD is detected? Or put them in stasis for 5 mins to
allow reconnection? Either way, I'd just gank the connection every time
I was about to die, wait until the danger had passed, then log back on.

The 'difficult' part is distinguishing between a 'real' loss of
connection, and a deliberate one.

Try to give me an example of how it would work WITHOUT being obviously
exploitable, and you'll find it actually is *very* difficult
