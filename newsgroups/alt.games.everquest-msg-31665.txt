ok, but why not the advisory approach prior to petition?

if you were to let him know the ramifications of his naming choice and
"suggested" he try to petition "himself" to get it changed to something
suitable and within the rules instead of starting the process off with a
petition

like I stated before, you provide a fine service to the entire eq community
by dedicating your free time with your website..... I know, I've been there
and recommended it....... why take the officer approach instead of the peer
approach?
