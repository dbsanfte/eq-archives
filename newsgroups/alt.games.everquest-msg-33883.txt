Yes, we do make awesome melee PL'ers. ;) Some people argue that enchanters
are better (nuke to near-death, mem wipe, have other char kill) but that
really hurts skills and you have to wait for the enchanter to med. Shaman
make good melee PL'ers too because of Haste, but I still say Druids are
top-notch .. Second-best HP/AC buffs, best Regens, and second-best damage
shields of all classes. ;)
