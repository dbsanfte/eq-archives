In the high end game, rangers are desirable as damage producers, trackers,
taggers, snarers and "get em off me!" taunters.

While they -can- form a tank  nucleus most groups will try hard to avoid
this unless doing something well under normal capacity for their level,
because their typically abyssimal AC and HP makes them about as
good a sponge as a sheet of Kleenex is.  I'd sooner have a ranger than
a second warrior... but I'd probably sooner not go if I can't get
something more absorbant than a ranger as MA.

For steady damage production, rangers class in with rogues and monks,
best in the game at pouring in the melee tonnage.

As trackers, rangers blow away everything else, in fact at level 30 you are
a better tracker than any druid or bard will ever be, assuming you are
on good acquaintance with the /tracksort commands, and your range is
only going up, while theirs is already capped out (or in the case of bards,
not yet existant but yours is higher than their eventual cap)

Rangers are often drafted as taggers, with long range bows and a history
of practice, or snare tagging, cancel tagging... and with Jolt to lose the aggro

once the mob comes in and the MA grabs it.  Oh, and they usually shrug off
the inevitable death that comes with that job as part of the Ranger mystique.

Snare is one of the most important jobs in the game, a runner can ruin your
whole day.  While druids, wizards, and necros can also snare, its often
left to the ranger, who's less potent snare still does the job fine, and who's
AC and HP are far better than that of the snare competition, unless you have
an SK along.  Oddly, I almost never see an SK relegated the snare job,
perhaps their snare is as bad as a ranger's heal?
