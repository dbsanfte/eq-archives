I haven't done all that many LDoN adventures (less than 25 total) but
I'd consider quite a few of the drops there as upgrades for your
casual 65 player. MMC seems to be the weakest dungeon in that regard, 

This weekend I saw 3 items go NBG in our LDoN runs. A BST got a 12ac
45hp/mana neck item, cleric got some plate greaves that were 40+ac
with nice stats and our mage got an ID4 belt.
