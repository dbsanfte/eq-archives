Odd, I have tanked at every single level up to 65.

Any melee class can tank up to the 50's (read: planes), rangers are good at
it as they have nice taunt spells.

It gets tougher in PoP but it is still possible for rangers to tank, without
being uber.

the Ranger's main duty is pouring out damage, either from

Rangers are a melee class until at least level 59.

Once in the 50's,

Yes, if not tanking.  Jolting blades is nice, but I find Jolt to be
superior.

I would write this as two skills that change the rangers attacking options.

This would be my summary:

Ranger: Traditional role Damage per second Other roles: Crowd control, tank,
tracker, puller.

Rangers are best described as a light offensive tank.  They are a hybrid
from the Warrior and Druid classes, and recieve many spells from the druid,
and can wield almost any weapon type, dual wielding many of these.  They
also recieve ranger only spells, such as attack buffs (to increase your
parties melee damage output). From 1-59, they are primarily a melee class,
and make fine tanks, depending on gear focus, all the way up to 65.  Note
they wear chain, and should not be relied on to tank very hard hitting mobs
without good backup, and if they do succeed it would be far less efficient
than using a 'Real' (plate) tank.  Typically, after 50, a ranger will not be
asked to group to tank, although if needed, they can still do a good job of
it.

Snare is perhaps the best spell a ranger recieves, yes nukes are nice,
damage shields are handy, but snare is a very powerful tool, it prevents
trains, it allows enchanters to charm mobs with less risk of death, it makes
loss of aggro by the main tank less of a disaster, a combo of Ensnare +
Tangling Weeds on an incoming mob, will allow that mob to be slowed with no
loss of aggro, which makes up for their lower damage mitigation somewhat

At level 51, rangers recieve double damage on all non-rooted, non-moving
mobs with a bow.  At level 55, they recieve /disc trueshot, which again
doubles the damage and increases the chance to score a critical shot. At
level 59, they recieve the option to buy archery AA's, which open up a new
array of attacking options via use of a bow, with Endless Quiver, and
Archery Mastery.  This is a powerful tool, but is quite situational and
sometimes must be used with care. A very high quality bow is needed to make
the most of these AA. They do not define a ranger as a class, as later on
melee will once again outdamage your bow, which will become a tool as was
intended.

Rangers are very good at controlling their own level of aggro, they have
both high aggro spells like Flame lick and Tangling Weeds to quickly get a
mob off of a cleric / robe wearer.  They also have a line of aggro-reducers,
namely Jolt, Cinder Jolt and Jolting blades, this is to get aggro off of the
ranger should the tank have issues holding aggro (jolting before you take
aggro is advised).  The first two are player cast, the second is a self
weapon proc (-500, -500, -150 hate respectivley).

Outdoors, rangers are powerful and fast pullers, rivalled only by bards, and
in some situations, better.  This is due to a combination of Harmony of
Nature (single target outdoor lull, mobs up to lvl65), a fully sortable
tracking list (distance, mob difficulty), movement buffs (sow / soe), and
inate camoflauge (ranger class AA).

If you do not have any form of crowd control, rangers can deal with around 3
adds without too many problems, more is possible but not advised in most
situations.  A rangers version of crowd control is typically ensnare the
add, move it away from the group, then root it and walk away, repeating as
needed.  Another option (usually if there is space / more adds) is to snare
the mobs, then kite leading it and its friends around and till your group is
ready to deal with it.

Indoors rangers suffer from the lack of lull, but tracking can still be
valuable to find Boss mobs.

Rangers are not an easy class to play well, they do not have any 'get out of
jail free' skills like many classes get, so a mistake made by a ranger can
often be a fatal one.  Played well, they can be a valuable asset to almost
any group.

/End

Hmm too long I guess, will edit it down later will leave it up to annie
which she wants to use, personally I found some info in Chris's summary to
be misleading, but it is hard to be clear about a complicated class in a few
paragraphs :)

Gotta love my 'cant get to sleep reply to random post posts!!'
