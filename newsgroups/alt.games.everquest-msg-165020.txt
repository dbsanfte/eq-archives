A paladin with DA and sanctification :)
If he got his holy steed, even better, he can make them run around 
easily while someone else (a FDer generally) picks two or three out of 
the pack and bring them to the raid party if you want to kill them 
before the epic mob, otherwise he can just pull the epic mob first, but 
that kills the fun and it's not something the paladin will like :)
A simple sow instead of the horse is enough though.
I personally did it successfully many times, and I didn't die almost 
each time hehe, that was a long time ago though.
