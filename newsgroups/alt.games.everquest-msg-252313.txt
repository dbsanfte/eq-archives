No kidding, it's a fine game and it's getting better. I playtested Zoo
Tycoon 2 at Microsoft late last year and even back then it was great fun and
excellent use of a 3d interface to add benefit to an already good game. I
see it's been announced now and there's a site for it, but still shows a
Fall release date. If you liked the original you should check this one out.
