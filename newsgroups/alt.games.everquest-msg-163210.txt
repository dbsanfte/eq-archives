The link below has the proper way to camp Pyzjn.  She's just like any other 
mob that has a PH, except that she can only spawn at "night".  She is an 
uncommon spawn, not rare like some people thing.  She would pop for me 
about 1 out of 4 or 5 chances.

I did it as an enchanter with a tracking friend most of the time.  Learn 
her spawnpoints if you aren't a tracker.  Tomax will lead you to her spawn 
points if he lives long enough.  He drops the note on a Pyzzie spawn point 
then high-tails it away.

It helps if you can charm - you can charm the PH that spawns in the daytime 
and kill it at the right time as night approaches.  I would usually kill it 
at 5pm game time for 2 reasons:

1) If you kill it immediately at 4:00pm, you will get a Daytime PH on the 
next pop - you have to wait 17 seconds after 4:00pm before you kill it.

2) There are people that think she pops at 8pm, 12am, and 4am so killing 
her at 5pm will make her or her next PH spawn at 9pm, which was enough to 
throw off some of the people who didn't know how to really camp the gal.

If you can charm, charm her daytime PH, take it over to the pond, and fish 
and beg ( from your pet ).  Save the fish and kill some bats for wings and 
make fishrolls.  Time killers.

If you're high enough to kill Hadden, take him out now and then.  I think 
we killed him 4 times, no earring.

They have changed QHills to have different mobs.  I bet the Pyzjn cycle is 
the same, even if they changed some of her PH names.  In the past, if you -
ever- saw a Putrid Skelly walking around ( always towards the ring, of 
course ) it was a guaranteed nighttime PH.  A friend of mine says Putrids 
can be found walking around all the time, now.
