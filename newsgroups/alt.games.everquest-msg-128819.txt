Thank you, Ted Turner....

Your "facts" are completely biased and totally without merit.

Israel has only attacked military targets. Legitimate targets in
warfare.  Yes, there has been collateral damage.  And that is a
tragedy.

But Israel has NEVER specifically targeted civilians.  Israel has
never specifically went after innocent women and children.

THAT is the difference and THAT is why Israel has the moral high
ground here.
