This beta was rather tricksy...initially they did not warn people that
their machine would be scanned, hence needing to apply from a machine that
met the specs.  However, even once they put information out a lot of
people applied from work and found out that they ruined their chances
(they have said they will not update the dxdiag's for individual
applications).

Seems to me they used the application process (ie, those who read the FAQs
on the boards did OK, but those who were new to EQ2 and just dived into
the app often ended up doing something to disqualify themselves) as part
of the screening process itself.

As someone who successfully submitted an application from the machine I
intend to play on (which meets requirements) my evil side is rather
pleased SOE did it this way. :P  The nicer part of me is annoyed at SOE
for yet again being poorly organized.
