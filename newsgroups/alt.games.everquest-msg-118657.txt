I will agree that the hunters who live in urban areas spend money on hunting
and it is definitely in the hobby category.  What I will argue is that MOST
hunters do not come from this category.  Most of them are folks who live
close, or fairly close, to the land and hunting is a combination of land
management (protection of crops and livestock) and seasonal food source.
