No, the raw number of xp you have earned will not change.

Now that is true. But -- although you'll lose 1.4x the pre-patch xp
upon death, every subsequent kill you make will also gain 1.4x the
pre-patch amount. Thus the time required to recover lost xp is 
exactly the same. How is that a nerf?

What remains to be seen is that the Resurrection line scales the
same way. It should recover the same percentage of lost xp as 
before, not the same raw number of xp. We'll see, I guess.
