My level 35 was playing with a 52 shaman last weekend.  We were running from
PoK book in Great Divide to Spider bridge in Crystal Cav.  Once we got
there - I had some fun with the spiders, let me tell you... but...

On the way, he cast invis on me - mainly to avoid first giants, later orcs
(we had lev, floated down to the bottom of a huge pit, and ran to the
bridge...  This was to prevent aggro.

Well, the bummer is, every 15 secs or so, the spell would fade... stop,
recast, run, etc.

The real bummer was one time if faded as we were levitating to the bottom of
that pit - talk about the mother of all trains... between the lag and being
stunned - I couldn't move...

my question:  Can anyone tell me why the spell was constantly fading?  I was
playing a 35 barb warrior, and he was a 51/2 barb shaman...  I didn't have
any wierd spells going on, I wasn't clicking on NPC's to
interact/buy/sell/fight with them... heck I wasn't even conning...

Thanks!
