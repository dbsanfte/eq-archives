Actually with some of the new aggro rules, it might do.
Imagine two 12th Level Warriors hunting Elite Gnolls in BB. One is in full
crafted and the other in bits of banded, leather and some bronze if he's
lucky.
The Gnolls going to have a real hard time hitting the guy in Crafted and so,
by verants new idea, the mob will hit the player it can, the non twink.
This is just a theory, I have not seen it in practice and have not noticed
any less or more aggro on me when grouped (If I'm puller I normally get most
of the punishment directed my way and if not I'll get plenty of attention
while I'm dishing out damage.

That's just a theory, grouping with twinks isn't a bad thing, they rarely
worry about loot and more than pull their weight due to equipment, only
becomes a problem when they act like a spoilt child and brag about their
equipment. All twinks had to start from the bottom once, they are all quick
to tell you that, just a shame that some seem to forget it all to quickly as
well.

What I find amusing are people who take being called a twink as an
insult...Why? Everyone does it, some more than others, some badly (Felhammer
on a 16th level warrior, for example ;�)) some just to get past 10th or
20th, whatever. Everyone remembers seeing their first twink and wondering
what they were doing wrong, why dioes he have shiney armour and I'm wearing
raw-hide, etc.

Twink Jealousy? They'll get over it...I did :�)
