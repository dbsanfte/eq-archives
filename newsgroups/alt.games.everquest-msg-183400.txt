Well, I played a cleric to 53, and I always supplied my dots.... and
always had a stock of them.  Yes I have ran out once or twice, but
that was after a very long Field stay, and before PoP was around.

I also would take any dot's offered to compensate me, and honestly I
looked at those that did, in a more favorable light.  No not saying I
didn't heal the others etc, but I remembered those that were
thoughtful of my expense.

As a 52 monk now, I am often OOC'ing "WTB Aego or Virtue, Paying 50pp"
and you might be supprised as to how often I will get a direct tell
from some cleric to come to them... they are not advertising the
services and are not wanting more customers.  and when they are
casting the buff, "Its nice to see someone who understands the cost of
a cleric to buff" or some where in that line of thought.

my thoughts,  ITs a two way street.... Treat your cleric good, they
diserve it.  and clerics.... get your damn dots,  its your
Job....expensive as it is.... its your job.
