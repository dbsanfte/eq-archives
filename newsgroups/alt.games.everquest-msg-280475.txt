That chart in its entirety reflects class penalties as well as racial 
penalties. For comparison purposes, just leave the right side set to 
warrior, as they have removed all class penalties (or offset them with 
kill bonuses, anyway).

Actually, it may be more accurate to set the right side to one of the 
priest classes (cleric, druid or shaman), as they are more the baseline 
class while the warrior class actually received a bonus over the other 
classes IIRC.
