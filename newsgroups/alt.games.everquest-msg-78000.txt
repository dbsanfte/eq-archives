Well, the first thing you have to do is to put a point on the tracking 
skill at the guild trainers. It will then appear in your "abilities" list. 
Drag it from there to a hotkey slot. When you want to track, hit that 
hotkey, and a window with a list of nearby mobs will appear. Click on the 
one you want to track, and then the "track" button on the tracking window 
(known affectionately as the "trackdar"). You will get a series of messages 
indicating whether the mob is ahead of you, to your right, etc.

At the beginning, you want to use tracking A LOT so the skill goes up. It 
will cap at 125, so once you reach that number, use it only when you need 
it.
