That's actually one of the things that I hated about EQ1. In outdoor zones,
i hated sitting on my pony. I liked my wolf form, thank you. Without it, I
didn't feel very druid-ey, more like a bad cleric. As the later game was
entered I found that more and more I had to group (i loathed charming, and
thought that that belonged to enchanters anyway, although i have no problem
with some sort of calm animal spell).

I miss many things about eq1. The feeling of speed, the zones where wolf
form reduced aggro, kiting and root rotting and fishing while i killed
something, but i do not miss sitting aggro.
