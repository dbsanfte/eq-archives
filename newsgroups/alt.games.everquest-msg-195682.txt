As my Main, Izaak has no real twinkage, just two hand-me down items from a
friend (does that count?;-)
Otherwise its all shop bought and personally quested for.

Soooo...

Last night, LATE, (finishing at 0345)- I got myself a Speed of the Shissar,
and on the way through Nexus and PoK was the happy recipient of an HoS and
an MGB'd Virtue...
Ready to rock and roll!
Down to Cabilis, take the potion (casting time about half an hour...) and
say the phrase. Port to glox's secret hideaway and take him down easily, I
took about a red and a half of damage.
Then a quick ask around the guild to see if anyone was interested in helping
out - all involved in a raid, sadly.
So off to OT and catch teh boat.
All this time I had 6 LD's. Pretty much every zone in. Had to restart the PC
and relog on several times. Always getting 1018 errors. I had NO idea if the
bffs would still last.
On the TD boat... ANOTHER LD...
Restart, and re log.
Find myself half way to ogre island. OK, I'll swim it.
SoW goes down....aaaarrrrgggh!
Get tot eh shipwreck and happily quaff another Blood of the Wolf.
Swim like mad to the Island.
Will the buffs hold?
Will they be enough if they do?
I find myself standing next to GM Rinmark. OK, I'm a goin' in!
Say the phrase, and wait..
And wait..
still lokking at the buff icons...
Wait a bit more (it IS the trial of PATIENCE, right?!)
Wait some more, and up pops Rinmark - DB to a level 45!
Auto attack on, pummeling FK ky and INtimidation, just in case...
Down he goes. I used mend after wards, he had taken me to about 2 red on the
health bar.

Net result -I just did this bit solo! Got both the Marks (Patience and
Agility) in one session.
Off to the Dreadlands and grab a lev to get to Veltar, go through the
phrases and Voila! A shiny new (OK< partly used) shackle of Tynnonium is
MINE!

Such a rewarding feeling after all teh mad long camps.
I am at the point of trying to get Kwinn to spawn now, to get the copper
shackle. I have nearly all the bits for the Bronze, too.
So, next plan is to head to Sol B for some soloing of Mr T the Rock, and
then to Lower Guk, for Raster.
It cant be harder thatn teat bleedin Young Roninb (I have spent about 2
weeks in RL doing that bit), or the fingered skelly!
Please say in ain't so!

I'll be 50th in about another three months at this rtate, and well ready for
my Epic.

Wish me luck, I wish it to you all on your quests!
