I know that you get giant faction for killing dwarves.  I also know that you
can become non-KOS to at least SOME of the giants.  I don't know the details
required to become non-KOS to all 2 or 3 giant factions.

Thurg armor is worse than either of the other two, but it's a hell of a lot
easier to get.  If you're near ally with dwarves now, get what ever thurg
armor you want, then kill the dwarves...all the dwarves, over & over until
giants like you. :)
