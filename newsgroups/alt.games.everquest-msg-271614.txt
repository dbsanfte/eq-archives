Yes, but not enough info. It says what is done, but not how to do
it. Its one of the faqs that works if the reader knows what is being
talked about.

I did figure pulling out for myself. I saw someone walking a toon
backwards away from a lone Qeynos guard. I /ooc and asked if they
were teasing the gurads ? /ooc yup was the reply.

So I took my berserker and tossed an axe at an orc centurion over in
gfeydark. And started going backwards. It followed. It started to
slow down and I had my toon toss another ax. When it got down to 60
percent, I let it catch my toon and smacked it. 

But if I hadn't encountered that player doing that, I wouldn't have
figured it out.

And no, I don't like grouping and then informing the other players I
have no clues. And no, thats only a minor reason for me not to
group.
