It boggles the mind that people continue to complain about EQ2 being 
group friendly.  That's what game has been designed for and promoted as 
from day one.  The same thing with EQ1, in that case they pushed it even 
more in the beginning as a group oriented game when it came out, yet 
people to this day are still complaining that it's a group oriented game 
and it's tough soloing. Double duh!

I solo and it's tough a lot of the time, but that's how the game was 
written.  It's not a democracy where people playing it get to design it 
according to their own wants and needs. But that sure doesn't stop them 
from trying over and over and over and over for years.
