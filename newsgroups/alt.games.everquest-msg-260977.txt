I don't even think I was here when Brad was around, but I'm having 
trouble buying that. Maybe he he put off addressing shaman issues with 
alchemy for whatever reason (gee, I'm guessing there were a few more 
critical issues with the game at the time), but I just don't believe it 
was because he didn't believe the bug reports.

Player: "Shaman can't train alchemy."
Brad: "I just tried. It's working fine."
Player: "You don't understand. It only works if you do it this way."
Brad: "I don't believe you. My trying it one way obviously represents all 
possible scenarios. No fix for joo!"

Nope. Does not compute.
