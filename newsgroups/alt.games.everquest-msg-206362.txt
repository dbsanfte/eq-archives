From the shadows, the mysterious Khosh <test@test.com> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

He shouldn't do that at 16. Charm doesn't last long enough at that
level. The fights are starting to last too long too, because mob
damage output is piffless compared to hitpoints at that level (a
problem from L10-20 for PCs too). End result - the pet breaks before
the first fight is over *way* too often for it to be viable, and this
is no druid, he has no snare to make it worthwhile.
