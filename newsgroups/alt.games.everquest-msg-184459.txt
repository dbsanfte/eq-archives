Bad place to find pickup groups on my server. Theres usually a couple of
groups hunting in there. I dont think soloing would be easy here for a
druid. Lots of adds and litle space.

Ive been hunting there a few times with my enchanter with a druid partner.
Seems to work well... perhaps you just need to find a chanter. One annoying
thing is that dire charm pets seem to despawn after a while. Some of the
good loot spots need a rogue to open doors for you.
