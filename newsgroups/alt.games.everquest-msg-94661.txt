Playing a cleric as well, there is a reason Clerics get heal spells faster
than Druids or Shaman...  Their primary role is HEALER.  Druids and Shamans
have spells that Clerics will never touch.  For instance, Druids port, SoW,
Camo, Wolf Form, Damage Shield and DoT.  Shamans can DoT, summon a spirit
wolf, buff in other ways, and bear form.

Clerics have Rez type spells, good AC/HP buffs, AC buffs, heals, and invis
to undead, but they can't SoW, they can't change form like shamans and
druids, they can't port other people alive to another zone like Druids,
they can't make potions like Shamans, they can't exactly DoT until they get
to a higher level.  Their DD spells are mostly effective against Undead.
Clerics, by far, have been defined as a medic type class in all genres of
RPGs that I have seen.

Also, don't forget, Druids and Shamans have Regen buff spells, which does
help Druids and Shamans as healers, as they do not have to constantly cast
large agro heal spells as Clerics do, and Clerics only have Celestial Heal
at a high level to do something similar.
