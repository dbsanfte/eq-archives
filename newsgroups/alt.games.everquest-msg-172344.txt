You certainly CAN C2 him if you so desire, by the exact same mechanism used to
C3 him.

Well technically no, you can't.  C2 is a single target spell, you can't cast
it on him due to level restrictions.  However, you can cast the group C2 spell
(gift of pure thought?  I forget) on yourself with him grouped with you, and
boom, he has the group version of C2.

Likewise, there is no C3, which is to say, there is no single target version
of KEI.  Why, I don't know.

On Morell Thule, I've never seen anyone offering to buy Aego... which can't be
cast on single targets who are below the level range, nor BOA, which can be
cast in the same way as KEI to include "illegal" targets... for anything close
to what KEI goes for.  You'll regularly see 100pp offered for KEI, the only
offers I've seen for BOA were for one peridot...yes one, despite a 4 peridot
cast cost.  Oh, and then the mana on BOA is 2000, more than twice that of KEI.

KEI, though, is far far more useful to most recipients than BOA, so I can't
complain about this; its just a fact of life.  I'd have to get 230pp per
person plus 42 more pp for peridots spent, in order to make the same pp per
mana spent that a chanter does, even this wouldn't really work out
proportionately since that chanter would automatically have (and be
refreshing) KEI on himself so his downtime is being reduced dramatically.  At
a guess, then I'd be looking at 300pp per person to cast BOA on full groups,
to make the same income per hour.

BOA, though, is about 1/10th as useful as KEI, so realistically people should
be paying 10pp for it.  Sadly, this is right in line with what they have been
offering.  BOA just isn't a moneymaker, and there's no reason that it should
be.
